A petition calling for Obama and the Department of Health and Human Services to commission a study re-examining female genital mutilation (FGM) figures has reached over 47,000 signatures.

The petition is led by 24-year-old Jaha Dukureh, who lives in Atlanta, Georgia.

Dukureh writes on the petition's Change.org page that she was a victim of FGM as an infant in Gambia.

'This is just the beginning of our work and we won't back down,' Dukureh says

'It took away a part of my femininity, my ownership to my body,' she says. 'Some girls, including my half-sister who died from complications from being cut, even lose their lives.'

'When I was 15 and I got married and I was unable to have sex it was like I went over FGM all over again, because when they cut you open, even though this initially happened to me as a baby, but the re-opening process was just them cutting me again,' she said in a video interview with the Guardian.

The World Health Organization says the practice doesn't have health benefits and carries multiple risks, including infertility, urinary tract infections and cysts.

Dukureh says on the petition's page that she's spoken with American victims of FGM.

'These young women are your average American teenagers -- some of them you know, some of them you went or go to school with,' she says. 'And there are many more girls in the US that are at risk of being cut.'

Call for change: Dukureh is asking the Obama administration and the CDC to commission a study that shows how many women and girls are victims of FGM and how many are at risk in the US

The practice was outlawed in the United States in 1996.

Dukureh notes that while Obama signed the Transport for Female Genital Mutilation Act in 2013 - which makes it illegal to take girls out of the country for FGM - there aren't recent statistics on the number of victims and those at risk.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in 1997 that an estimated 168,000 women and girls either had or were at risk for FGM.

Sanctuary for Families says the number of women and girls at risk increased by 35 percent between 1990 and 200.

Dukureh's campaign was backed by Congressman Joe Crowley (D-NY), UN representative Nafissatou Diop and Guardian editor-in-chief Alan Rusbridger at its launch last week. The paper previously endorsed a FGM awareness campaign in the UK.

'This is just the beginning of our work and we won't back down and we won't go away until girls are protected,' Dukureh says.
