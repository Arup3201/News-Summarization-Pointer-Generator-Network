So THAT's her secret! Kim Kardashian pays a stylist £3,000 a day to perfectly tailor her jeans to fit her derriere, according to Grazia

According to Grazia, Kim and Kanye employ stylist Cornelius Clay to make alterations whenever the couple desire.

'It means Kim can buy jeans, have them altered and be photographed in them within a matter of hours,' revealed the source, who also claimed that Kim even gets her own Kardashian Kollection jeans tweaked.

'Kim has a size 4 [UK size 8] waist and size 10 [UK size 14] bottom, so she often has to buy a size up and have jeans taken in at the waist for a snug fit. She's only 5ft 2in, so they're often taken up a few inches, too,' added the source.

After Kim made a very racy appearance
 in Kanye's music video for Bound 2, it was claimed she may have had a 
little help in slimming down her waist in scenes which show her writhing
 around topless on a motorcycle.

But
 the mother-of-one - who welcomed baby daughter North 'Nori' West' into 
the world last June - has insisted she worked hard to achieve her trim 
post-pregnancy shape, after months out of the spotlight during which she 
embarked on a gruelling exercise regime and strict high-protein Atkins 
diet.

Asked how she achieved her gym-honed physique by TMZ last week, she said: 'No carbs, workout and dedication!'

And the showbiz stalwart admitted losing the 50lbs she gained while pregnant was the 'biggest challenge' of her life.

Speaking
 to chat show host Jay Leno in late October, she said: 'Actually I got 
on the scale today and it said that I am 50lbs down. That made me so 
excited. I can honestly say it was the greatest challenge of my life.'

Stylist to the stars: Clay dropped out of Yale after he was offered a job as creative consultant to Kanye West

chance meeting won him a dream job as personal stylist and creative consultant to Kanye West.

Clay, who is from New Hampshire and now 23, had been studying History of Art at Yale, when he was stopped by the world-famous rapper and music producer during a shopping trip at New York department store Barneys.

West complimented him on the way he was dressed, sparking a short conversation. The pair exchanged email addresses, and within weeks, Clay was hired.

In his very first interview, published on the website of fashion label Opening Ceremony, Clay said that despite his conservative background, he had always had an eccentric personal style.

At the age of ten, he had already shunned his school dress code in favour of his own personal uniform.

'My school had a dress code of khakis with collared shirts for the younger boys. Dissatisfied with the informality of khakis, I adopted a personal uniform of exclusively white turtlenecks, grey flannel trousers, and black & white spectator shoes.'

He admits to being 'obsessed' with Nicki Minaj and cites Vogue veterans Anna Dello Russo and Grace Coddington as his favourite stylists.
