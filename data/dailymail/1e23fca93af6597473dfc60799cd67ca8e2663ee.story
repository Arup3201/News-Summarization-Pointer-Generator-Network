Accident: Brian Ross, a correspondent for ABC, said that he stayed with the man he hit until the ambulance came and apologized

ABC News correspondent Brian Ross hit a jaywalker and left him with a broken arm as he drove his BMW through Manhattan.

The local anchor for WABC struck Roman Dati, 52, as he pulled up to the station's studios in the Upper West Side on Sunday.

Ross had the right of way as he turned left and hit Dati as he jaywalked at the junction of 67th Street and Columbus Avenue, but immediately took the injured pedestrian into the station's lobby and waited with him before medics arrived.

Dati, who is a former taxi driver, was left with a broken left arm, back pain and bruises, according to the New York Post.

Ross said in a statement: 'As this happened right in front of WABC, I was able to take (Dati) inside our lobby and waited with him until the police and EMTs arrived, who then put his arm in a sling and took him to the hospital.'

'My only concern was to ensure the gentleman was OK and treated immediately.'

Ross was also apologetic and tried to shake Mr Dati's hand as he waited for medics.

ABC spokesman Jeffrey Schneider gave a more descriptive play-by-play of the incident, which did not result in any charges or summonses.

Scene: The Sunday evening accident occurred on the corner of West 67th Street and Columbus Avenue around 6pm

'He [Dati]stepped off the curb, put his hand
 onto Brian’s hood and pushed himself backwards... He fell down and hurt
 his arm,' Mr Schneider told The New York Post.

There were no drugs or alcohol involved in the incident, which took place at around 6pm.

Mr Dati said that he immediately recognized the correspondent's face when Ross got out of his Series 7 BMW.

'I said, "I know this guy, I’ve seen his face!"’ Mr Dati told The Post.

'When
 they took me towards the ambulance, he came over and apologized. He 
said he was very sorry and wished me well. He said he hoped I had a good
 recovery and shook my hand.

Hit: Mr Ross was driving a 2013 BMW Series 7 like this one at the time of the accident
