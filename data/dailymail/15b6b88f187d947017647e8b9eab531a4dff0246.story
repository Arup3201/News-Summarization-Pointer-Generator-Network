After years of sticking to its signature, small handsets, Apple finally gave in to demand and launched two phablet-style iPhones in September.

But as phones increase in size, the screens become harder to use - especially when trying to navigate or type with one hand.

To see how phones measure up to the average hand size, designers created a graphic that reveals the 'natural' and 'unreachable' thumb zones of four of the most popular handsets from Apple and Samsung.

The graphic (pictured) was created by California-based technology professionals site Experts Exchange. It compares the average hand measurements of men and women, as well as the hand size of sports figures such as Lebron James. The hand size of Robert Wadlow, dubbed Giant of Illinois, was also included

This included the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, and Samsung's Galaxy S5 and Note 4.

'Smartphones have continued to increase in size but our hands have not. Have you ever wondered how big your hand needs to be to easily reach the entire screen with one hand?,' explained the California-based site.

In December, a study found that smartphones have become so integral to modern life, they may have altered the shape and function of the human brain, according to new research.

Experts found that people who use touchscreen phones on a daily basis have a larger and more powerful somatosensory cortex - the area at the centre of the brain which controls the thumbs.

They think that the more time someone spends fiddling with their smartphone, the bigger the link between brain and hand.

Neuroscientist Dr Arko Ghosh, who led a study into the impact of mobile phone use, said our ‘newfound obsession’ with smartphones demonstrated the ability of the brain to mould to its circumstances. 

‘We ran some calculations for the iPhone 6, 6 Plus, Samsung Galaxy S5 and Galaxy Note 4, then compared that to several athletes.’

According to the graphic, the average woman is 5ft 4in (1.6 metres), with an average hand height of 6.7 inches (17.1cm) and width of 2.9 inches (7.3cm).

While the average man is 5ft 9.5in (1.6 metres), with an average hand height of 7.4 inches (18.8cm) and width of 3.3 inches (8.3cm).

Apple’s iPhone 6 has a 4.7-inch (12cm) screen.

The Samsung Galaxy S5's display is 5.1 inches (13cm), the iPhone 6 Plus’ screen measures 5.5 inches (14cm) and the Galaxy Note 4’s display is 5.7 inches (14.5cm). 

To put this into perspective, retired basketball player Shaquille O’Neal could use the iPhone 6 and Galaxy S5 comfortably, but Michael Jordan would struggle with the S5.

Even Lebron James, who is 6ft 7in tall can't use Apple or Samsung's flagship phones comfortably with one hand.

The only person who could comfortably use the iPhone 6 Plus and Galaxy Note 4 is Robert Wadlow - also known as the Giant of Illinois. Mr Wadlow was 8ft 11.1in (2.72 metres) tall and died in 1940. 

According to the graphic, the average woman is 5ft 4in (1.6 metres), with an average hand height of 6.7 inches (17.1cm) and width of 2.9 inches (7.3cm). Apple’s iPhone 6 (left) has a 4.7-inch (12cm) screen. The graphic reveals the ‘natural’ thumb zone (green), the 'reach' zone in yellow and the 'unreachable' zone in red

The Samsung Galaxy S5's (pictured left) display is 5.1 inches (13cm). The right-hand image shows the average thumb zones for the average woman and man when using the Galaxy S5

To use the iPhone 6 with one hand, the graphic shows that a user would need to have a hand that measures 9.6 inches (24.3cm) high, and 4.6inches (11.7cm) wide.

This increases to 11.4 (29cm) inches and 5.5 inches (14cm) for the iPhone 6 Plus and Samsung's Galaxy Note 4. 

Using these measurements, the graphic then reveals the ‘natural’ thumb zone for all four handsets, for the average hand size of both sexes.

It also shows the so-called ‘reach zone’ in yellow, and in red are the areas that the thumb can’t comfortably reach.

Apple is aware of this issue and introduced a Reachability feature for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, which is activated by rubbing a thumb over the Touch ID scanner.

This brings the app icons nearer to the bottom of the screen to make them easier to reach.

A Japanese company has also devised an extension for the thumb that lets people access the entire screen while holding the phone in one hand.

Tokyo-based Thanko's thumb-shaped style, called the Yubi Nobiiru - which translates to ‘finger growth’ - retails for £8.51 ($13.63).

Made of silicon, the fake digit weighs 0.024lbs (11g) and is hollow inside so it can be worn on a thumb or finger.

At its tip is a small black conductor, which ensures that modern touchscreens can register it when it makes contact.

Wearing the extender means that, with one hand, most people will be able to access the entirety of a phone screen with one hand.

In December, a study found that smartphones have become so integral to modern life, they may have altered the shape and function of the human brain, according to new research.

Experts found that people who use touchscreen phones on a daily basis have a larger and more powerful somatosensory cortex - the area at the centre of the brain which controls the thumbs.

Neuroscientist Dr Arko Ghosh, who led a study into the impact of mobile phone use, said our ‘newfound obsession’ with smartphones demonstrated the ability of the brain to mould to its circumstances. 

The iPhone 6 Plus is 7.78cm (3.06 inches) wide, while other large phones include the Samsung Galaxy Note 3, which is 7.92cm (3.12) inches wide.

Of course, that’s just from side-to-side - diagonally the 6 Plus is 14cm (5.5 inches), and the Note 3 is 14.5cm (5.7 inches).

The average male thumb is 6.96cm (2.74) inches long and for women it’s 6.32cm (2.49 inches).

Clearly this poses a problem, as the average thumb cannot stretch from one side of a phone to the other without part of the palm touching the screen, which can accidentally register an input.

Using the Yubi Nobiiru thumb extender, though, 0.6inches (1.5 cm) is added to the length of the thumb.

This means people can more easily reach from side of the phone to the other - as long as they don’t mind wearing the extender.
