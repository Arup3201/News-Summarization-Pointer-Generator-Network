Children will be allowed to buy liqueur chocolates as part of a Government drive to tackle red tape.

The imminent move will scrap the law that has long banned those aged under 16 from buying any confectionery containing alcohol.

But alcohol-misuse campaigners warned yesterday that drinks companies may take advantage of the change to create ‘alco-choc’ drinks for youngsters – exposing them to spirits from a young age.

Children will be allowed to buy liqueur chocolates and alcohol-laced sweets after a change in the law

Ministers are including the plans as part of the Deregulation Bill, a much-trumpeted move to remove unnecessary red tape, which is currently going through Parliament. 

They argue that the liqueur ban makes business difficult for corner shops, insisting that stores will benefit next Christmas – when sales for boozy chocolate treats are at their highest – without any negative effect on youngsters.

Critics have often ridiculed the ban, arguing that pounds of chocolates would have to be eaten before anybody could get drunk and three years ago the Government stopped requiring vendors of liqueur-filled chocolates to hold a licence to sell alcohol.

But there are concerns that alcohol firms may use the new law to market products specifically for children, familiarising them with the taste of spirits.

Labour peer Lord Brooke, the chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on alcohol misuse, said he would be opposing the law change because lifting the ban would create an unwholesome new opportunity for alcohol companies.

He said almost 4,000 school-aged children had been taken to hospital with alcohol poisoning last year, adding: ‘Bit by bit children get used to it and they are hooked before you know it.

'We have had a higher proportion of children being treated in accident and emergency in the last 12 months.’

Labour MPs condemned the move as ‘foolhardy’ and said that such a step should have been made in a health context, so that its full implications could be examined, rather than in a ‘red tape-slashing’ Bill.

Labour spokesman Chi Onwurah added: ‘You wouldn’t want bourbon or vodka in children’s chocolates, even if it is in too small amounts to cause damage.’
