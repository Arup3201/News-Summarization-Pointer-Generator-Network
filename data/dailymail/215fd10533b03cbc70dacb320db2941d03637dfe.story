One man was killed and another badly injured after they set themselves alight outside a temple in the Tibetan capital Lhasa on Sunday, in the latest protest over Chinese rule.

More than 30 Tibetans have engulfed themselves in fiery protest in the last year, but it's the first time the tiny country's closely tightly guarded capital has been targeted.

Chinese authorities have identified the dead man as 19-year-old Tobgye TsetenÂ  and the other man as Dargye, while American sources claim the two men were both waiters at a nearby restaurant.

The protest took place outside the 1,300 year old Jokhang Temple, a sacred place of worship for Tibetans.

According to one source, the two men hired a room in Taksham Hotel beside the temple at around 1pm.

At around 2.15pm they walked out of the hotel towards the temple and made a traditional victory call before setting themselves on fire.

There have been at least 34 self-immolations since March of last year to draw attention to China's restrictions on Buddhism and to call for the return from exile of the Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama.

Most have taken place in heavily Tibetan areas of China, but only one had occurred in Tibet itself and none in the capital.

Protests have become rare in remote Tibet and Lhasa in particular because of tight police security that has blanketed the area since anti-government riots erupted in Lhasa in 2008.

The latest incident occurred in the open-air Barkhor market near the temple in the center of Lhasa, an area popular with Tibetans and tourists alike.

Radio Free Asia reported on Monday that Lhasa was under heavy police and paramilitary guard following the immolations and that the situation was very tense.

China's official news agency Xinhua blamed the protests on separatists and said the incidents were handled quickly and order restored.

'They were a continuation of the self-immolations in other Tibetan areas and these acts were all aimed at separating Tibet from China,' Xinhua quoted Hao Peng, secretary of the Commission for Political and Legal Affairs of the CPC Tibet Committee, as saying in a statement Sunday.

Xinhua said the injured man, who they have named only as Dargye, was in stable condition and able to speak.

U.S.-funded radio broadcaster Voice of America said the two men worked at a Lhasa restaurant called Nyima Ling.

'This was the first time it has happened in Lhasa - and right in the middle of Lhasa,' said Tenzin Tsundue, a Tibetan poet and one of the most prominent activists living in India.

China says Tibet has always been part of its territory. Tibetans say the Himalayan region was virtually independent for centuries

He said it reflects the fact that anger against Chinese rule is not restricted to the areas where most of the self-immolations have occurred - mostly ethnically Tibetan areas outside the legal boundaries of Tibet.

'All over Tibet it's the same emotion, it's the same response' to Beijing's policies, he said.

'We are always in fear of the next self-immolation, and whenever it happens we say prayers. And every time it happens we hope the world is listening."

Two months ago a Tibetan protester set himself on fire in India during a demo against a visit by the Chinese president.

Jamphel Yeshi sustained burns to 98 per cent of his body when he sprinted for 50m outside the Indian Parliament building engulfed in flames.

He later died.

China says Tibet has always been part of its territory, but many Tibetans say the Himalayan region was virtually independent for centuries until Chinese troops invaded in the 1950s.

Beijing blames the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, for fanning anti-government sentiment and routinely purges monasteries and nunneries, where support for the Dalai Lama and Tibetan independence runs high.

Angry and desperate Tibetans have taken to self-immolation in protest, as many as 34 since last March.

Last November a 35-year-old nun was captured in a horrifying video after setting herself alight on a Chinese street.

And in March a Tibetan man self-immolated in New Delhi, India, to protest a visit by the Chinese president.

The centuries-long tradition has become a type of radical political protest and more than 500 have been reported in Western media since the 1960s.

But debate rages over the controversial method of protest. Some Buddhists say suicide is violence, and therefore unacceptable, while others see self-sacrifice for a greater cause as legitimate.
