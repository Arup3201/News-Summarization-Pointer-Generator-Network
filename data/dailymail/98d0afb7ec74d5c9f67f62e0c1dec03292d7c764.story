Residents have been left baffled and bemused after contractors botched a painting job by marking out a parking bay around a signpost.

A photograph taken by a surprised resident shows the new parking bay in Romford, east London, marked out with white paint at the side of the road.

But the contractor appears to have been oblivious to the signpost around which they've painted - which clearly makes using the space impossible.

The parking space in Romford, east London, was measured out and painted despite the presence of the signpost

Retired engineer Phil Wailing, 63, spotted the metal post surrounded by fresh white paint as he walked his dog near his home on Sunday.

Bemused grandfather-of-two Mr Wailing said: 'It really beggars belief.

'I think the contractors must have been down the Aspen Tree pub at the end of the road before they started painting.

'It smacks of the work of jobsworths but you've got to laugh.'

Havering Council said contractors 'mistakenly' painted around the sign on a pavement and the paint would be removed as soon as possible.

Erroneous, and often baffling, council paint jobs are surprisingly common - in December, Britain's shortest double yellow lines were found on a street in Cambridge.

The road markings are designed to separate a residents' parking zone (left) with a pay and display area (right)

The lines have taken over the title as Britain's shortest double yellows from another set in Cambridge

The 11 inches long marking on Hamilton Road, Chesterton, were designed to separate a residents' parking zone with a pay and display area.

But residents and motorists said the markings, which are about the same length as two iPhone 6's, were a 'ridiculous' waste of time and money and branded them 'pathetic'.

Jennie Youce, of Burwell, parked up next to the line and said: 'It is absolutely ridiculous. What a complete waste of time and money. I can't understand why they even bothered with it. It is pathetic.

'And the question is, are they the exact distance between the residents' parking bays and the pay and display signs? Because they look a lot wider than that.'

Another bungled paint job to bewilder locals occurred in Cumbria when workers painted double yellow lines across the entrance to a hospital.

The double yellow lines were painted through a busy T-intersection and across the face of a hospital

The workers painted the no-parking zone outside Workington Community Hospital in Cumbria because they were using maps from before it was built.

Drivers labelled the situation an 'embarrassment' and a 'waste of cash' because Cumbria County Council would have to get them removed.

Robert Benham, Havering Council's cabinet member for environment, said: 'This is a very silly mistake and I’ll be taking this up with our contractor personally - this isn’t the first time common-sense has been called into question, there has been a catalogue of errors.'
