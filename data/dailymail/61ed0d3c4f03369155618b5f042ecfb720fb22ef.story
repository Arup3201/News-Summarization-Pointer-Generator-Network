It had become one of the most talked about beards in football, but on the eve of Republic of Ireland's clash with Gibraltar, Roy Keane has given his facial hair the razor treatment.

It hasn't been just a tidy up, either. The Aston Villa assistant  has completely hacked off his beard to leave behind an almost fresh-faced Keane.

The picture of Keane's new look came courtesy of the Irish FA, who tweeted a picture of Martin O'Neill's assistant for Ireland.

It is one that makes him unrecognisable to the figure that has helped Villa boss Paul Lambert patrol the touchline in the Premier League this term.

The Irish FA tweeted: 'We can confirm #RIPtheBeard! Roy has decided to shave the night before our first home qualifier! #makethematch'.

He will hope it's the only close shave he will have to face this weekend, as Republic of Ireland are expected to win comfortably at home in their Euro 2016 qualifier with minnows Gibraltar at the Aviva Stadium on Saturday.

It's not just the three points on Keane's mind, with the former Manchester United captain also promoting his new book, The Second Half, this week. One which Keane was keen to pose with his beard in tact as recently as Thursday inside the Aviva Stadium.
