Dozens of Tory MPs are set to rebel in a crunch vote for the controversial HS2 line tonight, amid claims that homeowners could be criminalised for not letting officials into their homes.

Some 20 to 40 Conservatives are expected to defy party whips and vote against the north-south rail project late tonight.

But the rebellion by Tory MPs could have been far worse had Labour not vowed to vote in favour of it, ensuring it will go through.

Protestors will descend on parliament and dozens of MPs are set to rebel as the HS2 Hybrid Bill goes before the House for its second reading

Hundreds of ‘Stop HS2’ campaigners are to descending on Parliament today to urge MPs to vote against the HS2 Hybrid Bill at second reading.

They warn that ‘every one vote for the bill will mean a loss of hundreds of votes at the next General Election’

Campaigners will be demonstrating in Old Palace Yard from noon until 2pm before going in to Parliament to meet with MPs.

Campaigners raised fresh fears last night over the impact on families living near HS2.

They pointed to a clause in the small print of the bill, which gives a ‘right of entry’ to anyone nominated by the HS2 Ltd company to enter any property within 500 metres of the line.

Richard Houghton of HS2 opposition group, HS2 Action Alliance said: ’A refusal to provide entry would be a criminal offence. This new power not only applies to the route of Phase 1 of HS2, but to any property near any other potential future high-speed line.’

He added: ‘This has massive implications. If you try to protect your property and stop the Government riding a coach and horses - or train - through your home or normal democratic planning application process requirements, then you could be jailed.’

Another clause (Clause 47) allows ministers to compulsorily purchase any land - anywhere - if they think it HS2 creates ‘an opportunity for regeneration or development’.

Despite preparing for a bloody nose from backbenchers, Downing Street expects some ministers whose constituencies are crossed by the line to be conveniently away for the vote. Among those is David Lidington, the minister for Europe, who is delivering a lecture in Estonia.

Newly appointed Treasury minister Andrea Leadsom has also been a vocal opponent of HS2 before her promotion to government, calling the case for it ‘questionable’ and ‘rapidly deteriorating’.

Michael Fabricant, a former Tory whip and leading rebel, said backbenchers would have come out in much greater force had Labour not said it would push the bill through.

Between 80 to 100 of his fellow MPs have ‘really serious doubts’ about the £50 billion London to the Midlands and the North line, he said.

‘Only 30 or 40 will rebel but I can tell you 80 to 100 people have really serious doubts,’ he said.But the Lichfield Tory said several MPs were reluctant to ‘use up our stocks’ with the party’s whips when the project is expected to clear its second reading thanks to support from Labour.

‘If Labour was against it then the rebellion would be a lot bigger than 40...it’d be double the amount of rebellion that we’ve got now,’ he told Sky’s Murnaghan.

‘People are saying, ‘Well, if it’s going to go through anyway why use up our stocks with the whips?’ Former Tory Welsh secretary Cheryl Gillan who has tabled amendments to block the Bill and will vote against it added: ’The business case doesn’t stack up.’

But she conceded: ’There is no doubt that with all three parties whipped to support HS2, there is no chance to stop it. But I have to register opposition on behalf of the many people who do not want this project.’

Tory MP Andrew Bridgen, who has the HS2 line running through his North West Leicestershire constituency said the issue is ‘toxic for the Conservative Party’ and predicted Labour would ‘ditch’ its support three months before the General Election.

But Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said ahead of tonight’s vote that the country had ‘waited long enough’ for a high speed line.

It was time to stop ducking the decision, he added. The former chief whip compared rebels to those opposing the West Coast Mainline nearly 200 years ago.

Parliament rejected the initial bill in 1832 because some people objected to the railway north of London.

A year later, it was finally passed. Mr McLoughlin attacked the strategy of ‘incremental change’ by simply ‘patching up’ transport needs.

‘Cities and towns in the Midlands and the North deserve better. Scotland deserves better Britain deserves better. That is why I support High Speed Two. A new north-south railway line.’

He said his support came with ‘much humility’ and ‘not a little caution’ but also confidence Labour Shadow Transport Secretary Mary Creagh defended her party’s support saying: ‘Labour is supporting HS2 to cut congestion on the railways, better connect our great cities and help deliver a One Nation economic recovery’.

The TaxPayers’ Alliance urged MPs to oppose the Bill and expressed ‘severe concerns about the cost and value of the HS2 project’ which it said will cost every family in the country more than £1,500.

TaxPayers’ Alliance chief executive Jonathan Isaby said: ‘We call on the Government – and Opposition parties – to vote against this Bill.

‘It’s unbelievable that this wasteful vanity project has been allowed to proceed so far despite its flimsy business case.

‘The project should be abandoned now before any more taxpayers’ cash is squandered on what risks being the most expensive white elephant of all time.’

The Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) urged MPs to ‘abstain’ from the Second reading vote saying ‘we are not convinced the case has been made for High Speed 2 (HS2) in its current form.’

A report by the free-market Institute of Economic Affairs said claimed Government benefits to the North were ‘a myth’.

But business backed the scheme. Dr Adam Marshall, executive director of policy at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said: ‘HS2 must proceed. Parliament must progress the scheme quickly, to ensure the benefits are felt before overcrowding, delays and cancellations become the norm rather than the exception.’

Preparatory work on HS2 is set to start in 2016 ahead of building work in 2017. The first phase from London Euston to Birmingham will be completed by 2026, with an ‘accelerated’ section to Crewe finished the following year and the full route to Manchester and Leeds the North by 2030.
