Tracey Connelly has allegedly said she deserves special treatment because of her 'suffering' after her son's death, and wants a bigger council house

Tracey Connelly, the mother of murdered Baby P, is asking to be rehoused in a larger two-bedroom council flat.

Connelly, who was jailed in 2009 for allowing her son Peter to be tortured to death, says she needs the extra space to attract a new man

She claims that she is the real victim, and deserves special treatment because she has 'suffered' over the death of her baby.

Connelly, 32, was jailed indefinitely in 2009 for doing nothing while her boyfriend Steven Barker and his paedophile brother Jason Owen to tortured her son to death.

However she was released in October last year after a parole board said she posed no threat to the public and has since been living in a bail hostel in the north of England.

According to the Sunday Mirror, an inside source said: 'She is extremely demanding, and for Tracey it's all about her.

'She wants her own nice flat but when you come out of jail you get what you are given, but Tracey won't accept that.

'The greatest irony is that she sees herself as the victim in all of this so expects to be looked after.'

In December last year it was reported that Connelly was asking for gastric band surgery in order to help her lose weight and snare a new partner.

The 32-year-old told friends at the halfway house where she has been living: 'I need to do something about my weight. No one will touch me looking like this,' the Mirror said.

As well as the operation which costs the NHS between £5,000 and £7,000, Connelly said she wanted diet pills to help her lose weight.

A source at the hostel in North England said: 'She is desperate to lose weight but wants a quick fix, slimming pills and a gastric band on the NHS.

'She talks about getting herself a fella all the time.'

Connelly, who weighs 22 stone, reportedly spends most of her time in her room, only leaving the premises to buy sweets and chocolate mousse at a nearby store.
