A medley of meals dating as far back as the 18th century have been recreated down to the last detail after a series of ancient recipe books were unearthed.

The hand-written manuscripts, discovered among the family and estate papers of the Nostell Priory in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, detail perfected instructions and illustrations on how to cook an array of historic dishes.

Among the delights are a traditional Quaking pudding from the 1700s, which was rumoured to have 'cured the plague', cakes created from sheep's brain, and a recipe to 'alleviate a mad dog's bite'.

The ingredients of dozens of meals, some of which were forgotten hundreds of years ago, are being cooked up as part of an historic feast by catering students at Wakefield College.

The recipes have been supplied to the students by the West Yorkshire Archive Service who have revealed the secret ingredients so that they can be served up at the award-winning Gaskell's Restaurant for the public to get a real taste of years gone by.

Other dishes to be found on the menu are Mrs Woodman's Pea Soup - believed to have named after a former cook at the Nostell Priory - stewed rabbit and herb dumplings, and a sheep's head pie.

Laurent Berges, from Wakefield College, said: 'This is a perfect example of a live project with a respected local employer and agency.

'Our students and academic staff were 
given access to the archives an came up with an exciting menu for the 
customers of the College's award winning restaurant.

'It is very important students learn how to respond to a customer's brief, and develop outstanding professional skills in the process.
