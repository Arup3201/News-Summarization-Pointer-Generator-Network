Though a jury found Eric McGowen guilty of horrifically gang-raping an 11-year-old girl, two major issues remain in the search for justice.

One, McGowen, 20, hasn’t been seen since he vanished during a break in proceedings last week, and the Liberty County Sheriff’s Office had few leads to his whereabouts. In the case, 20 men and boys were charged with repeatedly attacking the girl over the span of five months, through December of 2010.

Second, the small Texas community of Cleveland remains divided on the rape – some residents have suggested the girl was partly responsible because of her appearance, sparking widespread condemnation.

Some also believe the arrests were 
racially motivated; all of the suspects are black, while the girl is 
Hispanic. The crime has created a still-lingering divide among 
residents.

And with the first suspect convicted 
in the case at large and several more defendants still facing trial, it 
could be some time before Cleveland, about 45 miles outside of Houston, 
is able to put the crime behind it.

Prosecutors say the girl was sexually
 assaulted on at least five occasions from mid-September through early 
December of 2010, at the mobile home and elsewhere. Others, however, 
anxiously await the capture of the first person tried and convicted in 
the case who ran off in the middle of his trial.

'She was just 11,' Charles Armstrong 
told the Associated Press, as he watched his three and four year old 
grandsons play in his front yard across the street from where the mobile
 home once stood.

'I'm not going to stand behind them 
(the defendants). I'm going to stand behind a jury,' said Armstrong, 
sitting in a plastic chair outside his mobile home following an 
overnight shift at his maintenance job at Wal-Mart.

Despite evidence at Eric McGowen's 
trial that included a confession, DNA evidence, the girl's tearful 
testimony and a video of her being assaulted, others haven't been 
swayed.

Caroline King, who lives down the 
street, insisted Friday that people still 'don't know the facts of the 
case' and said authorities were just 'harassing people' by knocking on 
doors in the town of about 7,700 people as they searched for McGowen.

'It's not as bad as what they are saying. Nobody tied (the girl) up,' said King, 59.

Some suggested early on that the girl
 was partly responsible because they say she wore makeup, looked older 
than her age and wasn't properly supervised by her parents.

But Comeka Robinson, who knows 
McGowen, described the girl as a 'baby.' She said what happened to the 
girl was wrong, but she also has doubts about the guilt of McGowen and 
some of the others charged.

'I would not recommend (he) turn himself in,' Robinson, 25, said.

McGowen, who had been out on bail, 
fled Wednesday after the girl testified that he sexually assaulted her 
multiple times, including once with a beer bottle.

The trial went on 
without him, and jurors found him guilty of aggravated sexual assault of
 a child and then sentenced McGowen to 99 years in prison.

It's unclear if divisions in the town 
may be complicating efforts to find McGowen. Authorities are saying 
little about the search.

Interim police Chief Darrel Broussard said his 
agency was working with the Liberty County Sheriff's Office to try to 
find McGowen, including checking places he previously lived in 
Cleveland.

The mayor did not return a message Friday seeking comment about the case.

McGowen was the first defendant to 
stand trial in the case. All six of the juveniles and two of the 14 
adults charged pleaded guilty. Trial dates have not been set for the 11 
remaining defendants.

Police began investigating after one 
of the girl's classmates told a teacher he saw video of her being 
sexually assaulted in the abandoned trailer.

Kim Shelton, a member of the Unity 
Committee in Cleveland, which was created several years ago to promote 
the city, said the community is working to deal with the crime and 
trying to ensure something like that never happens again.

Recently, a local church sponsored a 
conference to teach girls to respect themselves, for example. Shelton 
also believes parents are talking more to their children.

Earlier this summer, Shelton's 
committee began selling bumper stickers that say 'I (Heart) Cleveland, 
TX' as a way to promote the city and tell others it's a good place to 
live.

'We consider ourselves family and we are moving forward,' she said.
