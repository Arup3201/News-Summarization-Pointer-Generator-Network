Wayne Rooney believes it will take a serious injury before the Premier League bow to demands to overhaul the traditional festive schedule.

In joining the clamour criticising the fixture congestion, the Manchester United captain also claimed supporters are being short-changed by attending matches between exhausted teams.

United boss has Louis van Gaal has been among the most vocal critics of the Christmas fixtures, which saw sides play twice in 48 hours from Boxing Day.

The Dutchman followed United’s 0-0 draw with Tottenham Hotspur with the claim that it is ‘scientifically proven the body cannot recover in 48 hours’, and Rooney has now gone even further in calling for change.

‘It will probably take someone getting a really bad injury from doing it (playing twice in two days), which no-one wants to see,’ Rooney said. ‘But it is very demanding and I think it does need looking at.

‘As a player you want to play. It is tough, but you want to play and try to help the team win.

Radamel Falcao failed to score, and did not impress in the match at White Hart Lane on Sunday

‘If you look at all the games (on December 28), towards the end they will all lose a lot of quality.’

Rooney added: ‘With the weather as well, and the fans coming from London or travelling from Manchester, it has been tough. It is a lot of money to spend over Christmas.

‘But it is what it is, we have to deal with that and have to try and perform well.’

United blew a good chance to make up ground on league leaders Chelsea on Sunday, but after dominating the first half they wilted badly in the second.

Van Gaal directly attributed the drop-off to fatigue and Rooney said: ‘It is not easy playing two games in two days and you do lose a lot of the quality from both teams.

‘We started so well first half but in the second half it was tough and hopefully in the future it has to change because it is tough.’

A change could be forced if 14 of the 20 top-flight clubs pushed for it, though such gripes have not escalated to that level of discussion in the past.

While Rooney made his unhappiness public, team-mate Phil Jones says that fatigue is just an annual by-product of the festive fixtures and refused to use it as an excuse.

‘You have to do it,’ Jones told MUTV. ‘I think fatigue is always going to kick in with two games in three days but it’s the same for every club in the Premier League.’

United will be boosted by the return to the fitness of Ander Herrera for their New Year’s Day trip to Stoke as the £30million midfielder recovers from a muscle injury.

Jones says his team-mates are disappointed to only draw against Spurs, but refused to blame tiredness
