Brave: Sam Nagy has just become the youngest ever 'Good Samaritan' organ donor in Britain

Risking your own life for a complete stranger is a tough decision at any age.

But at the tender age of 20, it is even more remarkable.

But that is exactly what Sam Nagy has just done - to become the youngest ever 'Good Samaritan' organ donor in Britain.

This month the banking administrator had an operation to remove one of his kidneys - which will now go to a complete stranger.

The brave decision by Mr Nagy, from Huddersfield, was taken despite his mother expressing her concerns and admitting that she does not completely understand what motivated him.

Speaking to The Sunday Times, he said the first person he spoke to about his decision thought he was too young and should wait a while.

'By the time I had done all the research... I thought "I am quite mature for my age, what difference is a few years going to make?"

'If there are people on the waiting list who are in quite a bad way... what is the reason for waiting a few years?'

When he applied to become a donor, doctors did not express concerns about his age. His believes this is because he had carried out thorough research into the procedure.

But one person who did raise serious concerns was his mother, Karen, who said she was apprehensive about the operation.

'I'm extremely proud of him but part of me thinks 'At what point in your life as a young man do you wake up and think that this is what you want to do?'

She says that when he asked her what she thought, she told him she didn't want him to do it.

However, she did admit that if her son needed a kidney, she would hope there was somebody like Mr Nagy who was willing to donate one.

Mr Nagy's inspiration behind his bold decision came following voluntary work for a charity helping children in Kenya.Â 

Generous: Because of Mr Nagy's decision, another person will now benefit from his kidney

After having a bad day from seeing children suffering from abuse and people living in dreadful conditions, he decided there must be something he could do to help.

Mr Nagy does not know who has received his kidney or whether he will ever see them in the future.

On a blog which he writes, called Altruistic Donation, My Journey to Save A Life, he said: 'I'm just an average person, no amazing talents, no special abilities, just a motive to help.'

The previous youngest Good Samaritan living kidney donor was 25.
