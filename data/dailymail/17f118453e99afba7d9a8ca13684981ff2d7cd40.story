Arsene Wenger has confirmed Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain will miss up to four weeks with a hamstring injury.

As Sportsmail revealed on Tuesday, Oxlade-Chamberlain will miss a clutch of Arsenal's fixtures - including next week's Champions League clash against Monaco - after suffering a hamstring strain in Monday's win over Manchester United.

Speaking ahead of Arsenal's Premier League clash against West Ham, Wenger said: 'It's a hamstring injury. He'll be out for three to four weeks.

'It's frustrating for him but he's played more games this season than before. He's shown his importance.'

The Gunners star will also be unavailable for England's double-header against Lithuania and Italy at the end of the month.

Wenger also confirmed Jack Wilshere, who is recovering from ankle injury, will not be available for Roy Hodgson to pick next week.

He added: 'It's very difficult to say when he (Wilshere) will be back. We have to respect his recovery.'

Meanwhile, Wenger has confirmed Hector Bellerin is in line to sign a new long-term contract at the Emirates Stadium, as Sportsmail revealed on Thursday.

Club captain Mikel Arteta is set to resume full training following an ankle injury suffered at the end of November, and is expected to be in contention again at the start of April.

Arteta, 32, is out of contract in the summer, and is expected to agree a one-year extension.

'Normally I would like him to stay on, yes. He has a huge experience and is very important in the squad,' said Wenger, who also confirmed full-back Hector Bellerin was set for a new long-term deal.

Arsenal can cement their place in the top four of the Barclays Premier League with victory over West Ham, who have slipped down to mid-table.

'The mood is good as you can imagine, but focused as well because we know that every single game is a decisive game now, said Wenger, whose side head to Monaco next week looking to overturn a 3-1 first leg deficit.

'Every year it (making the top four) gets more difficult because you have more teams who can compete for it, and in future years it will be even harder.

'It is an important part to have a good mixture between focus and composure, that is not easy to find because the tension can be too big.'
