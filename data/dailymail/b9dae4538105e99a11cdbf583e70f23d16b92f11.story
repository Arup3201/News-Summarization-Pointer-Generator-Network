Andy Carroll believes West Ham’s move to the Olympic Stadium could herald Champions League football.

The target man has missed the entirety of the campaign so far thanks to a knee injury picked up in pre-season, but is looking at the Hammers’ prospects long-term.

The east Londoners will move into the 54,000-seat Stratford ground in 2016, and Carroll thinks it could be the dawning of a new era for the club.

‘When I first signed for the club the manager said this team could get into the top six and into Europe, and I can see the plan coming together now — it is not out of the question,’ Carroll told the Evening Standard.

‘With the players we have I can’t see any reason why we can’t do that.

‘We could definitely play in the Champions League in the new stadium. The quality is there, and with the new stadium coming we have everything else going for us.’

The Hammers will move to the London 2012 venue in 2016 after 100 years at The Boleyn Ground

Carroll’s ambition for the club deals a blow to Newcastle United’s hopes of resigning their former youth player in January.

The striker’s agent Mark Curtis was asked about any return to St. James’ Park for Carroll and told the Newcastle Chronicle: ‘Not a chance.’

Instead Carroll is said to be focussed on returning for West Ham and winning back his place in the England side.

Carroll is expected to return from his injury at the end of November.
