Levante forward David Barral was told to stop complaining on Saturday despite being on the receiving end of a tackle so bad it left raked stud marks all down his leg.

The 31-year-old played the full 90 minutes as his side lost 2-1 at Espanyol, but the former Real Madrid youth player's troubles didn't stop there.

Barral was accused of feigning injury during the match by referee Carlos del Cerro Grande, but he later posted photographic evidence suggesting the match official should have been more sympathetic.

He tweeted: 'The referee said he didn't touch me!! Hahaha.'

The photo also showed that Barral appeared to have an ice pack strapped to his ankle, although it is unclear if both injuries were sustained simultaneously.

Levante took the lead through Jose Luis Morales but their Barcelona-based opponents hit back through Felipe Caciedo and Sergio Garcia to leapfrog Lucas Alcaraz's side in the table.Â
