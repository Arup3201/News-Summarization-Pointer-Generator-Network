Due to its complex nature, scientists have only really been unravelling the mysteries of the brain over the last few decades.

And now researchers have discovered that the brains of mice contain at least seven unknown types of cells, including a nerve cell.

These findings are significant because they could shed light on diseases such as multiple sclerosis, explained the researchers.

Researchers have discovered a number of unknown types of brain cells, including a nerve cell, in the brains of mice. They used a process called single cell sequencing to produce a detailed map of brain cell types. The finding could shed more light on the human brain (a stock image of human brain cells are shown)

Using a process called single cell sequencing, scientists at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden produced a detailed map of brain cell types and the genes active within them.

It is the first time the method has been used on such a large scale and on such a complex tissue.

Researchers studied more than 3,000 cells, one at a time, to identify a number of previously unknown types.

‘If you compare the brain to a fruit salad, you could say that previous methods were like running the fruit through a blender and seeing what colour juice you got from different parts of the brain,’ said Sten Linnarsson, senior researcher at the Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics. 

Researchers studied more than 3,000 cells, one at a time, and managed to identify a number of previously unknown types. They then compared which of the 20,000 genes were active in each cell, which enabled them to sort the cells into virtual piles. From this, the experts were able to identify 47 different kinds of cell

Scientists analysed 3,000 cells from the cerebral cortex in mice.

They then compared which of the 20,000 genes were active in each cell, which enabled them to sort the cells into virtual piles. 

From this, the experts were able to identify 47 different kinds of cell.

These included specialised neurons, blood vessel cells and glial cells, which take care of waste products, protect against infection and supply nerve cells with nutrients.

They also discovered unknown cell types, including a nerve cell in the outermost layer of the cortex.

Six different types of unknown oligodendrocyte, which are cells that form the electrically insulating myelin sheath around the nerve cells, were also identified.

‘But in recent years we've developed much more sensitive methods of analysis that allow us to see which genes are active in individual cells.

‘This is like taking pieces of the fruit salad, examining them one by one and then sorting them into piles to see how many different kinds of fruit it contains, what they're made up of and how they interrelate.’

The discovery that all living organisms are made of cells was discovered almost 200 years ago by German scientists.

Since then, researchers have learnt that the nature of a particular body tissue is determined by its cells, which are determined by what genes are active in their DNA.

However, little is still known about how this happens in detail, especially in the body’s most complex organ - the brain.

After the scientist analysed the 3,000 cells from the cerebral cortex in mice, they compared which of the 20,000 genes were active in each one, enabling them to sort the cells into virtual piles.

They identified 47 different kinds of cell, including a large proportion of specialised neurons, as well as blood vessel cells and glial cells, which take care of waste products, protect against infection and supply nerve cells with nutrients.

The researchers identified unknown cell types, including a nerve cell plus six different types of oligodendrocyte. These are cells that form the electrically insulating myelin sheath around the nerve cells.

Then, they identified unknown cell types, including a nerve cell in the outermost layer of the cortex plus six different types of oligodendrocyte. 

These are cells that form the electrically insulating myelin sheath around the nerve cells.

The study, published in the journal Science, could shed more light on diseases that affect the myelin - or white matter - such as multiple sclerosis.

The disease is caused by the destruction of the white matter that forms a sheath around the axons of the central nervous system.

'Demyelisation' leaves scars or 'plaques' that cause various symptoms, including declining visual clarity, difficulty moving and speech problems.

Co-leader of the study, Jens Hjerling-Leffler, said: ‘We have created a much more detailed map of the cells of the brain that describes each cell type in detail and shows which genes are active in it.

‘This gives science a new tool for studying these cell types in disease models and helps us to understand better how brain cell respond to disease and injury.’

There are estimated to be 100 million cells in a mouse brain, and 65 billion in a human brain.
