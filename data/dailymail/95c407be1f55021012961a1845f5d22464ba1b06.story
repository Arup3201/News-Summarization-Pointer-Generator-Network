A man has died after an apparently unprovoked attack by a brick-wielding attacker as he popped out to buy some milk.

Umess Chaudhari, 41, was attacked in his street in Croydon, South London, in broad daylight as he walked to his local shop at 7am on Wednesday.

He was pronounced dead in hospital the following afternoon and a murder investigation has now been launched.

'Unprovoked attack': Umess Chaudhari was attacked in Dennett Road, Croydon, in broad daylight

An 18-year-old man was arrested at the scene and has since been sectioned under the Mental Health Act.

Members of the public called the police after they spotted Mr ChaudhariÂ  with serious head injuries lying in Dennett Road, Broad Green, just after 7am. A post-mortem will take place today.

Detective Inspector Bob Campany of the Homicide and Serious Crime Command said: 'The victim left his home in Dennett Road shortly after 7am.

'A short time later he was assaulted by the suspect. At this early stage in the investigation it would appear this was an unprovoked attack.

'I would like to appeal to anyone who may have witnessed the assault and hasn't yet spoken to the police to contact us.

'I would particularly like to hear from anyone who may have witnessed any part of the victim's and suspect's movements immediately prior to the assault.'

Chief Superintendent Adrian Roberts, Croydon borough commander, said: 'I would like to take this opportunity to extend my deepest sympathies to the family of the man who tragically lost his fight for life.

'As borough commander of police in Croydon I would like to reassure everyone living, working and visiting the borough that whilst the early details of this tragic incident are horrific, thankfully incidents like this are rare and I hope that some reassurance can be gained from the fact my officers arrested a suspect immediately, and that suspect has been sectioned under the mental health act.'
