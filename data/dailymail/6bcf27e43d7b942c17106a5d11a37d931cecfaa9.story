Five Tests between an England team who have forgotten how to win and an Indian one usually only victorious at home will decide the captaincy fate of Alastair Cook over the next six, highly-congested weeks.

Crunch time for a captain under intense pressure arrives in the  form of one of the most condensed  five-Test series of all time that begins today at a Trent Bridge ground where England normally swing their way to victory.

Certainly, in just 42 days at the Kia Oval it will be known whether Cook has come through the biggest test yet of his undoubted strength and remains the man to lead England in their attempt to win back the Ashes next summer.

Judgment on Cook may come sooner if England, without a win in eight Tests, suffer a repeat of their Nottingham defeat in the 2007 ‘jelly bean’ Test against India, or at a Lord’s ground next week where they could not get past Sri Lanka.

Cook is nothing if not a fighter and there was a quiet determination about him yesterday, as he weighed up a series that has assumed exaggerated importance through England’s failure to beat the Sri Lankans in all formats.

‘Until the day the selectors decide I’m not the right man for the job, I will continue to do it,’ said Cook, when asked if his captaincy could survive a series defeat by an Indian team who have gone 14 Tests without an away win — stretching back to before they were hammered 4-0 by England three years ago.

‘It is a huge honour to do this and I can sleep knowing I throw everything I’ve got into it.

‘I’m not in charge of when I go and I will continue to concentrate on the job I was asked to do. I’m incredibly proud to be England captain.’    

The pressure on Cook, in truth, has more to do with the fact that he has not reached 30 in his past six innings and is without a century in 25 knocks, rather than the tactical shortcomings that were so evident on the fourth day in Leeds.

‘I know how important it is at the top of the order to score runs and I’m desperately keen to lead from the front,’ he added.

‘No one’s more determined than me to put it right and I’ve worked very hard over the last 10 days.’

The ECB are just as desperate for Cook to come through the most torrid test of his mettle as he is himself, but they have not helped him with a crammed itinerary that will test the fitness and durability of his two key bowlers.

Trent Bridge is the most productive ground for Jimmy Anderson, who took 10 wickets in last year’s thrilling win over Australia here, and Stuart Broad, who claimed a hat-trick on home turf here against India three years ago.

Yet both looked out on their feet by the end of those two long, hard Tests against Sri Lanka and the key to this Investec series may lie with the pair’s fitness and ability to hit the ground running before India’s batsmen find their feet.

‘I can’t remember two games going as deep as that,’ said Cook of Tests against Sri Lanka that went to the last and penultimate balls.

‘Broady’s knee can get a bit sore and Jimmy is over 30 now, so he can pull up a bit worse than he did when he was younger. We will know more about them as the series develops.’

Team talk: The England squad in practice ahead of the first Test against India at Trent Bridge

To that end, England picked two extra seamers in their 13-man squad with a view to preparing all of them for battle over the coming weeks.

It seems certain that Ben Stokes will come in for the unlucky Chris Jordan today, with the perennial substitute Chris Woakes remaining on the bench for now.

England need to somehow get the gifted Stokes back in the team now he has regained full fitness and fluency.

He was particularly impressive with the ball in the nets yesterday, causing  problems for Sam Robson and Joe Root.

There was also an unscheduled appearance at practice for Jos Buttler, called up as cover after Matt Prior reported a tight thigh, but Cook said that he was ‘99 per cent certain’ that his senior keeper- batsman would be fully fit today.

Prior certainly seemed fine in lengthy keeping  sessions yesterday but another injury scare is a concern for a man with a chronic Achilles problem who might find the workload over the next six weeks  as hard as Anderson and Broad will.

It is the senior players who Cook badly needs to perform for him here because the paradox of England’s predicament is that the team is now brimming with achieving youngsters seemingly ready to prosper in the new era.

England are not the only team in transition.

India are rebuilding under MS Dhoni without Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, VVS Laxman, Virender Sehwag et al but there is no doubting the quality in a batting line-up featuring the contrasting skills of Virat Kohli and Cheteshwar Pujara.

There is more uncertainty over the Indian bowling that sees only the erratic Ishant Sharma with  previous Test experience in England.

It is an attack against which Cook should be able to add to his  average of 55 when playing India. It was against India that Cook hit his career best 294 at Edgbaston three years ago.

The memories of that golden summer, which saw Andrew Strauss’s England at their peak — and of those in India where Cook led his side to a 2-1 success after going one down — offer encouragement to the captain.

How Cook needs runs and a victory in Nottingham. More than ever before.
