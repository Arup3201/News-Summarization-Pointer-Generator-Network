Mr Green, who operates a coach travel company, said he was delighted to have fulfilled his life-long dream of opening a model railway display.

'The collecting bug is a gene that some people just have,' said Mr Green, who spent three years creating the display. 'I have collected all sorts of things over the years, but like all collectors, there is never enough space.

'I have seen big displays in Europe but nothing like it open to the public over here. I have always said there should be one, then thought why can’t we do that?’
