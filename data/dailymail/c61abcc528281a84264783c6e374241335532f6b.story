There's sure to be a food fight over this one...

Michael’s Pizzeria in Long Beach, California has been named the 'Best Pizzeria' in the United States meaning Los Angeles is deemed to have the best slice in the country.

Hard as it is to believe, Chicago's deep dish and New York's thin and crispy were hardly in the running.

Tony’s Pizza Napoletana in San Francisco’s North Beach neighborhood came a close second having held the title for a number of years.

Tasty: Zagat, the exclusive guide of restaurant reviews and nightlife ratings, has rated Michael?s Pizzeria, located on Naples Island in Long Beach, as having the top pizza in the country

'What an honor,' said Michael Dene, owner of Michael’s Restaurant Group.

'We opened a little more than two years ago, and for the second year in a row, we have been named the Best Pizzeria in Los Angeles and we managed to top that by being named the Best Pizzeria in the United States. It’s very humbling.'

But give New York some credit where it is due. Mr Dene grew up there and after moving to L.A. felt he needed to recreate a little bit of home on the West Coast.

'Michael’s Pizzeria was born out of necessity. I wanted realItalian pizza, not the take-out, cardboard variety we’re accustomed to eating in the United States.'

Michael claims he wanted pizza as it was meant to be. He wanted a pie with paper-thin crust, whose edges bubbled up into soft, crisp pockets of salty air, with sauce so flavorful it could stand as a topping all on its own and cheese so fresh it had to be made by hand each morning.

New arrival: Michaels has only been open for two years so their rise to the top has been meteoric

It has taken many decades for Los Angeles to be taken seriously when it comes to pizza.

A number of restaurants have led the way including Pizzeria Mozza, Stella Barra, 800 Degrees and Settebello, but even these pizzerias are not in at the top of Zagat's most recent surveys.

The restaurant's website states their raison d'etre: 'We know that pizza tastes best when it is wood-fired, that mozzarella should always be freshly made, and that meals are enhanced when paired with the perfect Italian wines.

From our service to our atmosphere, our flour to our sauce, this is our tradition-passed down from generation to generation-of Napoli-style pizza. At Michael's Pizzeria, food is heritage.'

Zagat Guide, a source for 
consumer-generated information, gave Michael's Pizzeria, the only Los 
Angeles pizzeria to make the list, a 27 out of 30 food rating.

Michael's
features hand-tossed dough, fresh sauces and herbs and homemade 
mozzarella. Pizzas are cooked at 850 degrees in a wood-fired oven for 90
seconds, and then delivered whole, not sliced.

There is a variety of pies on the menu but nothing too extreme.

The
anatra e provola is topped with duck confit, smoked mozzarella and 
caramelized onions. The caprino e carciofi is made with pesto, baby 
artichokes, fingerling potatoes, mozzarella and goat cheese.

The
vongole has Manila clams, corn and Calabrian pepperoncini. There are 
half a dozen 'white' pizzas as well, topped with ingredients like 
ricotta, figs, squash blossoms and pistachios.

Michael’s Pizzeria has three locations in Long Beach as well as one in Palm Springs.
