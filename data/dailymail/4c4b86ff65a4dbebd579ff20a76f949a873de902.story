One involves substituting food for alcohol, another sees slimmers try to survive off air alone.

These are just two of the fashionable celebrities diets which have made this year's list of the most dangerous fad diets.

As the season of overindulgence approaches, the British Dietetic Association has released a list of the celebrity diets that are best avoided.

Top of the list of diets to avoid is the Breatharian Diet, which Michelle Pfeiffer is said to have followed

Top of the list is the Breatharian Diet, which involves substituting food and drinks for air, followed by the Biotyping Diet, which sees slimmers attempt to cut their fat levels by changing their body’s hormone balance.

In third place is the Gluten Free Diet, in fourth the Alcorexia Diet, which involves substituting food for alcohol, and in fifth the Dukan Diet, a high protein and low carb diet which is said to promote rapid weight loss.

The Breatharian Diet - People who follow this diet claim they do not need to eat or drink as they are sustained by air and sunlight alone.

The Biotyping Diet - The diet involves carefully selecting foods in an attempt to change the body's hormone balance.

The Gluten Free Diet - This involves cutting gluten out of the diet meaning followers don't eat wheat, barley or oats.

The Alcorexia Diet - People who follow this diet eat very little so they have 'spare' calories which they can consume in the form of alcohol.

The Dukan Diet - This is a high protein, low carbohydrate diet which is said to promote rapid weight loss.

The Breatharian Diet was reportedly followed by actress Michelle Pfeiffer and is similar to Madonna’s Air Diet.

People who follow this diet claim they do not need to eat or drink because they are sustained by air and sunlight alone.

The British Dietetic Association says people should not attempt this diet under any circumstances as there is no evidence to suggest people can survive off oxygen and sunlight.

The Biotyping Diet relates to six different hormone types and fat accumulation in different parts of the body and involves trying to reduce body fat through controlling hormone balance.

People who follow this diet only eat certain foods in an attempt to manage their hormones to reduce fat in certain areas.

The British Dietetic Association says the diet relies heavily on supplements and ‘pseudo-science’.

It says people will lose weight on this 
diet as it restricts the intake of some foods but says it is not a 
healthy way to lose weight.

The Gluten Free Diet is said to be followed by Gwyneth Paltrow.

It involves cutting out gluten - the protein found in wheat, barley and oats.

The British Dietetic Association says
 it is important for people with coeliac disease to follow this diet and
 that it will lead to weight loss in other people - but that this is 
because they consume fewer calories.

It
 says there is no credible evidence to suggest that eating less gluten 
leads to weight loss – the diet causes people to lose weight because 
they cut out the cakes and biscuits that contain gluten. 

Third in the list of diets to avoid is the Gluten Free Diet which is thought to be a favourite of Gwyneth Paltrow. It involves cutting out all foods that contain gluten but is not recommended for anyone other than those with coeliac disease

The Alcorexia, or Drunkorexia, Diet is thought to be a favourite of many top models.

It involves eating very few calories and ‘banking’ them in order to binge drink at the weekends.

For example, a person might eat very few calories during the week so as to ‘bank’ about 1,500 calories a day.

This would mean they had 10,500 ‘saved’ calories which can be made up of drink at the weekends.

The British Dietetic Association says 
following a very low calorie diet alone is ‘madness’ as it will mean 
your body does not get the vitamins and minerals it needs to function.

Carole Middleton is said to have followed the high protein, low carb Dukan Diet which came fifth in the list of diets to avoid

It also says this is a very worrying diet which could lead to ‘immense damage’ to the body. 

The Dukan Diet came top of the list of worst celebrity dies in 2010, 2011 and 2012.

It is said to be followed by Carole Middleton and Jennifer Lopez.

It is a complicated high protein, low carbohydrate diet that promotes rapid weight loss.

The British Dietetic Association says the diet can lead to lack of energy, constipation and bad breath.

Sian Porter, consultant dietician and spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association, said: ‘We hear it all when it comes to the latest way to shed those pounds from the good to the bad, to the down-right dangerous.

‘When people need medical advice, they go to their GP and when people have a toothache, they go to their dentist, but some people will believe almost anything and anyone when it comes to nutrition, food and diet.

‘The bottom line is, if it sounds too good to be true, then it probably is. 

‘Also, if you have to pay out for a DVD or special book or product that will unlock the secrets of losing weight, this can also be a good indicator that the only pounds you will be losing will be out of your wallet. 

‘The simple fact is there is no “wonder diet” just as there are no “super foods”.  What is super is the way many marketing machines coin certain phrases to make you think there is some magic wand approach to losing weight.

‘Maybe it’s not as exciting but the truth is, if you do want to lose some weight do it by eating a healthy balanced diet, watch your portion sizes and be physically active.’
