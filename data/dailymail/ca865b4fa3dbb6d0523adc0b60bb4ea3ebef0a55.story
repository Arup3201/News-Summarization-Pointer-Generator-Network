The mother of two missing boys has issued an emotional plea for their safe return after they were allegedly kidnapped by their father five weeks ago, saying she will 'never stop looking' for them.

Sandra Hughes Dohm reported her sons Parker, eight, and  Jaxon, seven, missing on February 9 after her former husband, Kristopher Dohm, 36, reportedly failed to return them to her New Jersey home.

The boys had been scheduled to stay with their father for a week. Under a custody agreement that was made during the couple's 2012 divorce, Dohm was required to bring them home after the trip. 

But instead, he abducted Parker, who has asthma, and Jaxon and drove out of the state in his 2009 grey Nissan Pathfinder to an unknown destination, police said. The boys have not been seen since.

Now, Ms Hughes Dohm has released a heart-wrenching video begging for the return of her two sons, whom she says may have had their appearances altered by Dohm, who suffers from diabetes.

In the footage, posted on YouTube, the distraught mother, who shares custody of the boys with Dohm, tells her ex-husband: 'Kris, you need to bring them back home. They need their mother.'

Addressing the boys, she adds: 'Parker and Jackson, I love you dearly. If you can pick up a phone and call me, or call the police, or tell somebody, ask for help. I'm looking for you every day, every night.

'I love you and I will never, ever stop looking for you. Please come home soon and safe.' 

Ms Hughes Dohm has also released some personal details about her children in the hope that the public may be able to help in locating them, including their nicknames and their favorite restaurants.

In a post on a dedicated Facebook page, called Help Find Parker And Jaxon Dohm, on Saturday, the mother-of-two wrote: 'It has now been 5 weeks since I last spoke to my Parker and my Jaxon.'

'Kris may call Parker by Park, Parker Choo, Chewy or Moose. He may call Jaxon by Jax, Action or Action Jaxon. Parker and Jaxon LOVE Taco Bell - they prefer the Dorito Tacos and soft tacos. 

'They also like McDonalds, Italian Subs from QuickChek and Slurpees from 7-Eleven.' She added: We have a lot of eyes out there and I ask that you continue to keep watching out for them.'

Last week, Thomas McCormick, Chief of Detectives at the Sussex County Prosecutor's Office, said the alleged abduction may have been an attempt by Dohm to gain custody of the two youngsters.

He added that authorities have uncovered information that suggests the kidnapping was planned - and that the two victims could be at risk 'based on their father's dependence on insulin', according to ABC.

'We believe, based on recent information regarding their father's medical condition, that he may not be making great decisions,' Chf McCormick said. 'We believe that their [the boys'] safety could be at risk.' 

According to prosecutor Francis Koch, Dohm had allegedly asked his former wife for a few extra days with his sons so that he could fly them to Reno, Nevada, to visit 'his dying father', NJ.com reported.

However, investigators later found that Parker and Jaxon's grandfather was not dying, while no legitimate travel plans were made, Ms Koch said.

Arrest warrants were quickly issued.

On February 20, a federal warrant for Unlawful Flight to Avoid Prosecution was put out for Dohm.

Nine days earlier, a state arrest warrant had been issued for interference with custody, it is said.

A vehicle matching the description of Dohm's Nissan Pathfinder was seen in the Fort McHenry Tunnel in Baltimore, Maryland, early on February 6. There have been no further sightings.

According to police, Dohm has changed the license plates on his vehicle a number of times. He has used the New Jersey license plate characters: K15DXS, ZKL24F, and S17CKV, it is reported.

Chf McCormick said authorities are currently following up several tips regarding the alleged abduction.
