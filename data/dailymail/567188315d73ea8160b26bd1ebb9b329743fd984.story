A former Navy SEAL who was nearly hit by a car in parking lot then shot by its driver chased his assailant before driving himself to a police station to seek treatment.

In a sequence straight from an action movie, 44-year-old Christopher Mark Heben only sought help after realizing he was bleeding profusely after being shot in broad daylight in Akron, Ohio on Friday.

He is recovering in hospital after undergoing surgery and authorities are searching for his attackers.

The former SEAL, who has served in Iraq, Africa, Pakistan and Afghanistan, was walking to the Mustard Seed Market & Cafe at 5.30pm on Friday when he was almost struck by a car backing up.

On the mend: Christopher Mark Heben, 44, shared this photograph of him in hospital after he was shot in a parking lot in Akron, Ohio on Friday after exchanging words with a driver who nearly hit him

Feeling good: Heben, a former SEAL, had a bullet removed from his abdomen, which was then stapled, right

The occupants of the car started shouting profanities at him, police said, NewsNet5 reported.

He continued to the cafe - before turning back to his car after realizing he had left his wallet behind.

As he walked across the parking lot, the vehicle pulled alongside him again and Heben realized he had been shot, Bath Township Police Chief Michael McNeely told the Akron Beacon Journal.

He then jumped into his car and followed the vehicle - a gray sports car with tinted windows - as it drove north and headed to Interstate 77, McNeely said.

But realizing he was covered in blood, Heben drove himself to the Bath Township Police and Fire Department to seek treatment.

Minor incident: Heben, who has served in Afghanistan, Iraq, Africa and Pakistan, initially followed his attacker after he was shot but eventually drove to a police department to seek treatment

Inspiration: Since returning from service, Heben has worked as a special operations expert on TV and radio

'He indicated to us he actually plugged 
the hole in his abdomen to stop the bleeding as he drove to the 
station,' McNeely told NewsNet5.

He was hospitalized at Akron General Medical Center, where a 'brass projectile' was removed from his abdomen and then the wound was stapled shut.

Authorities are still hunting for the suspect or suspects and are reviewing numerous videos from local businesses to look for further information.

The police chief added to the Beacon Journal that publicity about the incident had already generated good leads.

Heben has been updating his Facebook group with information about his recovery.

Not to be messed with: He plugged his own wound as he drove to the police department for help

Expert: Heben has worked as a special operations expert on cable news networks and shows

'I've been up walking around, 
yesterday and again this morning,' he wrote on Sunday, two days after 
the shooting. 'The nurses are telling me to "take it slow".....YEAH 
RIGHT!

'The best thing for me to do is to keep my spirits up and to just keep moving! Onward and upward!'

He has also uploaded pictures to the Facebook page, which has more than 16,000 likes, showing his medication and of his abdomen covered with a large bandage.

According to online bios, Heben, a father, served in Iraq, Africa, Pakistan and Afghanistan and since returning, he has worked as a special operations expert on cable news networks and shows.

He has appeared on shows that have aired on the History Channel, the Discovery Channel and Channel 4 in the United Kingdom.

Scene: He was shot in this parking lot in Akron, Ohio after arguing with a driver that backed up into him

His website adds
 that he is the founder of INVICTVS Group, a special operations 
consortium, and holds a master's degree in physician assistant studies, 
specializing in sports medicine and emergency medicine.

He is also a public speaker and is to release his first album, The Patriot Project, this spring.

Back at the scene of the shooting, shoppers said they were impressed by Heben's quick thinking.

'He knew what he had to do to survive,' Mary Zeinert said. 'Someone else might not have been. I'm so glad that hopefully he will be okay and that they're able to bring those people to justice.'
