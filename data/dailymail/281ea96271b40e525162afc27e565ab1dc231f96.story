Found: A body thought to belong to Ypsilanti resident Brian Martin, was found Monday in Putnam County

Police have found a body believed to be  a man who was likely bludgeoned to death by his lover and her husband in June.

A body thought to belong to Brian Martin from Ypsilanti, Michigan, was found Monday in Putnam County, Ohio, according to the report by WXYZ. 

Police believe couple Robert and Desirae Strauss, bludgeoned the 54-year-old to death in their Toledo home.

Martin is thought to have had an affair with Desirae Strauss, 36, and may have believed he was the father of her children.

Robert and Desirae have five children, ages 11, 10, eight and twins born in April.

Martin, a father-of-two, went missing after coaching a softball game in Holland, Ohio.

A friend of the couple handed evidence to police that she said showed that Desirae had been having an affair with Martin for the past few years. 

Trisha Curtis said after she heard of their arrest she remembered Desirae had hidden letters from Martin in her van because she didn't want her husband to find them.

'I went searching for it because I remembered she stuck something in there,' she told 13ABC.

'I sat there and cried over it. I didn't know what I should do. 

'Me and my husband talked about it and we decided that was the best thing to do.' 

'It's tearing me up. I've been crying almost every day about it. I've been worried about the kids.'  

Martin's daughters Rachel and Andrea said they have mixed emotions after hearing the news that police believe their father's body has been found, reports 19 Action News.

Family: Martin with one of his daughters. They said they have mixed emotions after hearing the news that police believe their father's body has been found

Waiting: Martin with his daughters Rachel and Andrea - they have been waiting for five months for news of their father's whereabouts 

Grief: 'We just really want to bring him home and give him a proper burial, because he didn't deserve to have any of this happen to him and he didn't deserve to you know, be put somewhere,' said daughter Rachel Martin

'I think that was a lot of our feelings recently. We just really want to bring him home and give him a proper burial, because he didn't deserve to have any of this happen to him and he didn't deserve to you know, be put somewhere,' said daughter Rachel Martin. 

'I think when I saw the call come up on my phone I knew that it was probably the news that they found my dad. I think it's mixed emotions. It's still something that I can't really organize in my head right now.' 

The Strausses were indicted by a Lucas County grand jury in July on charges of aggravated murder, murder, tampering with evidence and grand theft of a motor vehicle. 

The Lucas County Coroner's Office will make the official identification. 

On her Facebook page Desirae has posted several pictures of her children.

One of them shows her three older children next to a 'tree where me and Rob Got married 12 years ago.'

Next to a photo of her during her most recent pregnancy she wrote: 'I'm 36, definitely a suprise!! Lol but were super excited and the kids can't wait.'
