The number of people living in England and Wales rose by nearly 400,000 in a year despite curbs on migrants, according to official estimates.

They show population growth has not slowed down after the years of large-scale immigration.

One reason is a high birth rate among recent immigrants, the Office for National Statistics analysis says.

The number of people living in England and Wales grew by almost 400,000 thanks to continuing high immigration and the highest birth-rate for 40 years

The latest figures, for the 12 months 
to the end of June last year, mean the population of England and Wales 
has grown by 3.97million, or 7.5 per cent, over the past decade of high 
immigration and rising birth rates.

In the latest 12-month period, the 
Coalition’s second year in office, ‘growth is about average to that seen
over each of the last ten years’ – but was still the highest in Europe.

Estimates for the whole UK have not 
yet been published but figures suggest the total must be close to 
64million – and is likely to reach 70million in around 16 years if the 
growth continues.

At that point, many analysts believe 
overcrowding will put unbearable pressure on housing, transport, water, 
power and services such as health and education.

More than 250,000 Londoners left the capital city, possibly because of the high cost of living

The England and Wales population grew by 396,900 thanks to a high birth rate and migration

Annual population growth first hit 
400,000 in 2005 after the borders were opened to Poles and other Eastern
European citizens in 2004.

Since then, net migration – the number
by which the population grows after both immigration and emigration 
have been counted – has often been 200,000 a year or more.

Immigration curbs introduced by Home 
Secretary Theresa May mean net migration fell to 155,500 in the year to 
June 2012. However, total numbers rose steeply because there were 
239,100 more births than deaths – more than double the level in 2003.

The ONS said: ‘The number of births was at a 40-year high – the largest since 1972.’

People are flooding south from northern cities, the ONS said.

Urban populations in the North East, North West, Yorkshire and the West Midlands fell, while more than 24,000 extra people moved into the South East.

The South West showed a gain of nearly 20,000, mainly because of retirees moving to Dorset, Somerset, Devon and Cornwall.

Some 52,000 people left London, largely young families moving to commuter towns for cheap housing and better schools.

The ONS said: ‘The general trend is for more people to arrive than leave for regions in the south and east, whereas for the more northern regions, the net flows show more people are leaving than arriving.’

Recent migrants tend to have high birth rates, with many of the right age to have children.

Sir Andrew Green of think tank Migrationwatch said: ‘This is yet more evidence of the impact of mass immigration.

'We have the largest number of births for 40 years and the greatest addition to our population among European countries.

‘The dual effect of immigration and extra births accounts for about two-thirds of our population growth.’

A quarter of the increase came in London, where birth rates were high and where many immigrants settle.

The increase of 396,900 people in 
England and Wales was the highest in Europe, followed by France at 
319,100 and Germany with 166,200.
