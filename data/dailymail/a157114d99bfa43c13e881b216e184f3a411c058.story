A physicist at Denmark's Niels Bohr Institute has recreated one of the two main particle detectors at the Large Hadron Collider out of Lego - and the replica machine is to scale with the tiny Lego engineers that walk through its tunnels.

Sacha Melhase used 9,500 pieces of Lego to build the model - a task which took him 35 hours.The Niels Bohr Institute covered his 2,000 Euro brick bill - hoping that Mehlhase's work would inspire interest in high-energy physics.

The scale model, built by Sascha Mehlhase using 9,500 Lego pieces, is of of the Atlas particle detector at the Large Hadron Collider - one of two particle detectors used in the hunt for the Higgs boson

The model took 35 hours to build - and cost 2,000 euros. Mehlhase enlisted help with sorting the bricks for his particle detector, but built it entirely himself

The Lego version of the LHC is almost exactly to scale with Lego men - and includes models of the Atlas detectors magnets and detectors

Mehlhase has contacted Lego to see if the Danish company is interested in making the model part of its official range.

Planning a 3D model took him 48 solid hours of work - before he even began sorting the bricks.

'It illustrates all details, from the muon spectrometer and magnet system to the innermost pixel detector,' says Mehlhase.

'I do not have a straightforward construction manual yet, but I am working on it!'

The real Atlas detector - one of two detectors that sit on the 'ring' at the LHC to monitor particles created in the high-speed collision - is about 70 feet wide and weighs 7,000 tonnes

Mehlhase's model is a metre by half a metre.
