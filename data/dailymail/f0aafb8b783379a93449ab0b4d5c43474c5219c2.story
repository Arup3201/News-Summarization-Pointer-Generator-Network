An eavesdropping, multilingual passenger has shed some light on the fascinating conversations taking place behind the wheel of New York cabs.

Urdu and Punjabi are the two most common languages spoken by immigrant New York taxi drivers along with English.

Around a third of drivers in the city come from Pakistan, India or Bangladesh, according to a survey in 2004.

Cabbie conversations: Some drivers use party lines to share traffic information or listen to preachers

After two weeks of riding in the back of cabs, the passenger collected wide-ranging snippets of conversation.

Some phone calls were used to discuss 
taxes, busy areas around town and drunk passengers - particularly on
St Patrick's Day.

One driver was overheard saying: 'If someone is going to throw up in the cab, my night will be over...I am going to be very picky today.'

Other chats were worthy of a day-time soap opera.

Pakistan - 14 per cent

Bangladesh - 14 per cent

India - 10 per cent

Haiti - 10 per cent

U.S. - 9 per cent

Egypt - 5 per cent

Former USSR - 4 per cent

Ghana - 3 per cent

Dominican Republic - 2 per cent

Morocco - 2 per cent

China - 2 per cent

Ecuador - 2 per cent

Colombia - 1 per cent

Romania - 1 per cent

Nigeria - 1 per cent

Afghanistan - 1 per cent

Jamaica - 1 per cent

Other - 18 per cent

According to the New York Post, one driver said: 'He is already married, but now he has a girlfriend in the U.S. too.

His wife was suspicious, and one day she found a picture on the computer, and now it's a big mess in their life.'

Party lines are commonly used by 
drivers. According to the Post, around 50 Pakistani and Bangladeshi 
drivers use group lines to listen to Islamic preachers while others 
share traditional songs and poems.Â 

Yellow cabs in New York City are governed by the Taxi and Limousine Commission, overseen by commissioner David Yassky.

A taxi license allows drivers to pick up hailing passengers across all five boroughs.

New York has 12,779 yellow medallion taxicabs making up a $1.8 billion industry, according to a 2006 study.

Drivers ferry around 240 million passengers a year.
