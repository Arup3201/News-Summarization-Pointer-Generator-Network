Trolled: Claire Goodwin, 31, was hounded on Twitter after she was the first person to be thrown off of the Great British Bake Off 

The first contestant to leave the Great British Bake Off has hit back after being trolled on Twitter by viewers calling her 'fat' and a 'cry baby'.

Claire Goodwin, 31, was hounded on social media following her departure from the BBC show, but brushed off the messages, saying: 'Sticks and stones will break my bones... but names will never hurt me.'

The speech and language therapist from Cheshire was the first person to leave after she became 'worked up' over a Swiss Roll she put together in a bid to impress the judges.

Using the hashtag #GBBO, viewers can interact with others during and after the show - but the comments started to become abusive.

One Twitter user, going by the name Josh Bache, said: 'Just seen Claire use hundreds and thousands?? off you go you fat melt!! #GBBO.'

Simon Hooley said: 'You think the fat bird would be great at baking cakes.'

Following the abuse, hundreds of fans of the show, which is now into its fifth series, rushed to defend her.

Viewer Sarah Burr said: 'Claire you're amazing', while another used described her as a 'legend and inspiration' to us all. 

Rhiain Geers-Davies said: 'Shocked at horrid people out there,' while Claire Nash added: 'Not impressed Claire has gone from Bake Off at all!'

Mrs Goodwin herself took to the social media site to tell fans she was 'ignoring the GBBO party carnage'. 

She posted: 'Sticks and stones will break my bones (well,maybe not owing to my apparently gargantuan level of blubber:WIN) but names will never hurt me.

The contestant admitted she became 'ridiculously worked up' over the cake and the pressure saw her burst into tears.

Mrs Goodwin said: 'Getting myself ridiculously worked up about the Swiss roll was my worst moment. Why did I cry about a cake?

'I
 don't know why I did, but at the time you feel very passionate about 
it, and everything is magnified and seems more important than it is.

Shameful: Twitter user Simon Hooley posted about Claire's departure on Twitter after the show 

'But in real life, it is just a Swiss roll, and I had a bit of a laugh about it afterwards.

'My friend has got a mug made especially for me with the words "I don't know why I am crying about cake... Claire Goodwin".'

Posting on her blog, Mrs Goodwin said that she had set up the Twitter account shortly before the hit BBC show had aired, saying that she had found it 'fun' and 'exciting'.

But she said that she quickly became preoccupied with what people were saying, and would become absorbed in negative reactions.

She said: 'I heard of the trolls and the keyboard warriors out there, sitting in an anonymous room, projecting their misery onto others through insults and unkind words.

Abuse:
 The speech and language therapist from Cheshire was called fat by users
 after her tearful exit - which was caused by her 'break down' over a 
Swiss roll

'But today I found people were openly mean. It appeared, under their own names, proud of their malice and hurt. The subject of the nastiness was my weight.'

She continued saying that 'a person should not be defined by any aspect of their appearance.'

Mrs Goodwin added that she had received support from last year's Great British Bake Off winner Ruby Tandoh, who yesterday wrote an article slamming online trolls.

The BBC has now advised contestants not to 'read, engage or focus' on any comments on their performance, according to The Daily Telegraph.

As the judges decided who should go, Mary Berry said: 'Poor Claire. She had a bad day, she was in chaos.'

The first show of the series, watched by 7.9 million viewers at its peak - its second highest ever audience.

That compares to 6.3 million who tuned in to the first episode of last year's series which was shown on BBC Two.

The Great British Bake Off has been contacted for comment.
