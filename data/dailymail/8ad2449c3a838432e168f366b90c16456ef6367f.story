Google Glass has already been labelled as being ‘as dangerous as texting’ when worn while driving, and now new research claims it also causes significant problems with vision.

A study of Glass users found that the headset obstructs the wearer’s peripheral view, meaning it creates a far larger blind spot, compared to standard glasses.

Experts have now warned against wearing the device while performing tasks that require peripheral vision, such as driving and cycling, as it may be dangerous.

Researchers from the University of California San Francisco found Google Glass (shown being worn by Google founder Sergey Brin pictured) obstructs the wearer’s peripheral view, in particular, an area known as the ‘superior-temporal quadrant’. This means the device creates a far larger blind spot than standard glasses

Motorists and pedestrians both rely heavily on peripheral vision to spot other vehicles, particularly at dusk or at night when light levels are low.

Dr Edward Koo, a clinical ophthalmologist at the University of California San Francisco, said the position of the prism that Google Glass uses to project its images to the eye was what caused the blind spots.

He said the obstruction created by the prism poses a particular risk to motorists  as it could obscure oncoming traffic.

'Google Glass produces a significant blocking effect of the right peripheral vision', Dr Koo continued.

‘The defect would not be compensated by the left eye and thus may negatively impact daily activities such as driving, cycling and running.’

The researchers analysed the vision field of three different volunteers wearing Google Glass, and compared it to them wearing normal spectacles.

Texting with Google Glass is just as distracting and dangerous for drivers as using a smartphone. 

Research has discovered that using the tech giant’s hands-free headset makes motorist delay slamming on their brakes to avoid a collision.

And this delay is similar to that caused when drivers use more traditional mobile devices.

However, the Glass wearers were able to recover control of their cars faster and more effectively afterwards.

The study, carried out by the University of Central Florida, asked 40 people in their 20s to drive in a car simulator either using Glass or smartphones.

Their reactions were recorded when a ‘vehicle’ ahead stalled.

The researchers compared text-messaging participants’ reactions on each device to times when they were just driving without multitasking. 

They found the prism of the Google Glass impeded vision in the upper right hand corner of their vision, also known as the ‘superior-temporal quadrant’, while the normal glasses had little impact.

Dr Koo said: ‘The superior-temporal quadrant is particularly important in driving as the location of the rear-view mirror as well as the right-side mirror in all US cars is monitored by the right visual field.

‘Motion detected in these mirrors by a normal peripheral visual field is what frequently alerts a driver to possible dangerous situations.

‘In the UK, where the driving position is reversed, the potential blockage of right peripheral vision for on-coming traffic may be even more of a public safety hazard.

‘The right peripheral field is also essential for many other activities such as providing the ability to perceive obstacles and hazards when cycling or jogging on the roadway.’

The researchers, whose findings are published in the journal Jama, also analysed more than 100 images from the internet of people wearing Google Glass to look for variations in the position over the eye.

They found that many people wore the devices so the prisms overlapped the centre of their pupil, which they warn could cause further blind spots.

The study will be a blow to Google, which has seen its Google Glass devices banned in a growing number of locations due to concerns over privacy.

Cinemas in the US banned the use of Google Glass in movie theatres last month, while the Department for Transport in the UK has warned that the device could distract motorists.

It is expected to fall foul of similar legislation that bans the use of mobile phones while behind the wheel.

Dr Edward Koo, a clinical ophthalmologist at the university, said the position of the prism that Google Glass (pictured) uses to project its images to the eye was what caused the blind spots.

A spokesman for Google Glass (diagram pictured) insisted there were no safety issues when the device is used correctly. He said: ‘Put on your shades, glasses, baseball hat, or hoodie, and you’ll quickly see this study tells us what we already know - wearing something on your face or head may affect your peripheral vision'

Google has been working with companies such as Mercedes-Benz to integrate Google Glass into their cars.

This, warned Dr Koo, would not be a good idea. However, he and his team are now working with Google to help them develop Google Glass so that it can be used more safely.

He said: ‘Our findings in this initial study show that the Google Glass device can potentially have a negative impact on the right peripheral vision of wearers. This can present safety issues not only to the wearers but for those around them as well.

‘Due to these possible public safety implications, we are planning on doing a significantly larger study to further assess the impact these types of devices have on visual function and attentiveness.

‘We reached out to Google prior to release of the study and it was clear that user safety was of utmost importance to them as well.

‘We are looking forward to working closely with them as we develop our next study as this would be a great opportunity for them to be involved and help drive improvement of their device.’

A spokesman for Google Glass insisted there were no safety issues when the device is used correctly.

He said: ‘Put on your favourite shades, glasses, baseball hat, or hoodie, and you’ll quickly see that this study tells us what we already know- wearing something on your face or head may affect your peripheral vision.

‘From the beginning, the Glass team has worked closely with a range of experts to develop a device that is safe for use, and after extensive study they have not found any safety issues when it’s used correctly.’
