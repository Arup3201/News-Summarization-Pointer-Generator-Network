Nicked: Many of the cases in the dossier involve stolen iPhones

BBC staff are suspected of  a catalogue of crimes at work – many of which have never been reported to police.

A dossier spanning four years shows theft and fraud allegations running at more than 500 a year.

A significant number of the suspects were employees at the broadcaster.

Documents also reveal allegations of sexual or indecent assault, as well as incidents of suspected drug use.

Thefts of TVs, radios, iPhones, Blackberry devices and computers from BBC staff were endemic.

In one instance, an employee was accused of having under-age sex while on assignment. Because the allegation could not be proved, the log showed the staffer was given only a warning.

This allegation, like many others, was not passed on to police for further investigation because the BBC’s internal investigations service – which employs former police officers – decided it could not be substantiated.

The disclosures follow the Jimmy Savile revelations which saw the corporation accused of turning a blind eye to decades of sex abuse by the presenter.

The dossier, which has emerged on the day Lord Hall takes over as the BBC’s new director general, reveals an apparently lax culture at the BBC when it comes to investigating crimes.

Many of the cases were closed with the remark – ‘no further action’. The incidents surfaced following a Freedom of Information request for details of incidents reported to the investigations service dating back to 2009.

Hundreds of thousands of pounds have been wasted through the loss  of expensive equipment, either  misplaced or stolen in offices, or on location, around the country.

And there are numerous details of thefts of televisions, smartphones, laptops, computer monitors and other technical equipment such as headphones and overhead projectors.

In each file, the BBC records the corporation’s actions and whether  the police have been asked to become involved. In many cases, the unit took the view the amount involved would not trigger an outside police probe.

The log reveals that in 2009 there were 503 cases of theft and fraud, with 586 the following year. In 2011 the figure was 566 and last year it totalled 526.

In many cases the location of the crime is not specified and there are no suspects, but in others it is clear that the culprit has been a BBC employee.

On January 6 last year, the log records a ‘member of staff’ submitting false handwritten receipts for meals he did not take’ and reveals the employee was dismissed.

Two months later, the log tells of the  dismissal of a member of staff for accepting ‘corrupt payments’ from an outside contractor.

Other entries into the database centre around drug use and the accessing of pornography on BBC premises.

Last night Matthew Sinclair of the TaxPayers’ Alliance criticised the BBC’s failure to punish criminal activity.

‘It is deeply worrying that criminal behaviour is occurring inside the BBC which is often not being properly investigated and therefore going unpunished,’ he said.

‘Licence fee payers will be shocked at the relaxed attitude which the Corporation appears to have taken in regard to thefts and frauds incurring significant financial losses.

‘This criminal behaviour is completely unacceptable and the BBC must be prepared to crack down on it and involve the police if similar cases occur in the future.’

A BBC spokesman said: ‘The investigations service takes all reported allegations and rumours seriously.

‘Experienced staff, many with police backgrounds, work with senior management, the HR department and the police to ensure all allegations are handled thoroughly and appropriately.

In instances where serious allegations are borne out, this has often resulted both in police action as well as dismissal.’

The spokesman said many items reported stolen were recovered and  that the BBC ‘made every attempt to recover monies where it is deemed financially viable’.
