Barack Obama will today outline his plan to ‘degrade and destroy’ Islamic State insurgency in both Syria and Iraq – on the 13th anniversary of 9/11.

The US President is to announce his long-awaited strategy for dealing with Islamic State militants in a rare primetime televised address this morning, just hours before commemorations of the terror attacks on New York and Washington.

In a statement ahead of his speech, White House officials said the US is planning to arm and train Syrian forces while stepping up air strikes on jihadis in Iraq – and possibly Syria.

Baghdad bound: U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry reads on a flight en route to Iraq on Wednesday on a visit to the Middle East to discuss ways to bolster the stability of the new Iraqi government and combat ISIS

Talks: Kerry will urge newly-installed Haider al-Abadi to unite the rival factions in his country - as well as offering U.S. help to tackle ISIS

They went on to say that the US is planning to pursue ‘a comprehensive strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy’ the Islamic organisation.

The US is already launching air strikes against IS targets inside Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi government.

But the mission’s scope has been limited to strikes that help protect American interests in the region and prevent humanitarian crises.

Mr Obama has said that while he ‘has the authority he needs to take action’ against the Islamic State militants, he would welcome backing from Congress that would ‘aid the overall effort and demonstrate to the world that the United States is united in defeating the threat.’ 

US officials said Mr Obama is expected to loosen those limitations and open a broader counter-terrorism campaign against militants in Iraq.

And following the beheading of two American journalists in Syria, Mr Obama, pictured, began considering extending strikes into Syria.

The President’s spokesman said he will go ‘wherever is necessary to strike those threatening Americans’. Polls show the American people support a sustained air campaign.

Currently 71 per cent support air strikes in Iraq, up from 54 per cent just three weeks ago. And 65 per cent say they support extending air strikes into Syria.

However officials said the extent of America’s commitment is likely to be determined by the level of military and political backing they receive from Europe and the Middle East.

US Secretary of State John Kerry, who is in the Middle East to get support for action against IS, met new Iraqi prime minister Haider al-Abadi yesterday and said he was ‘encouraged’ by his plans for political and military reform.

Mr al-Abadi formed a unity government this week to fight IS rebels’ advance in northern Iraq.

Efforts to root out the militant group will focus on bolstering the capacity of Iraqi security forces and the Syrian opposition, as the President has so far ruled out sending US ground troops into combat. 

And plans to give Iraq’s law-abiding Sunnis more control over their local power structures and security forces are also expected to play a crucial role in calming tensions.

Political solution: Kerry listens as new Iraqi Prime Minister Haider Abadi. The Obama administration has said that ISIS will not be defeated by military action alone. Kerry said after the meeting he was impressed by the premier's plans to rebuild the Iraqi military and push broad political reforms

Britain has already drawn-up extensive plans to support the US that includes airstrikes and UK Special Forces forming ‘advisory’ training teams to instruct Kurdish fighters how to use heavy machine guns ‘gifted’ by Britain this week.

Military commanders are said to be preparing to present the UK’s plan in support of the US to David Cameron within days, and it will include Tornado and Typhoon aircraft as well as an option to use troops in a limited role.

An Aviation Task Force of Chinook helicopters has been placed on high readiness to move to the region together with Typhoons and a further Royal Signals satellite communications squadron, that would support future operations. 

Planners at the operational headquarters have been working closely with their US counterparts at US Central Command in Florida to establish where UK assets and resources can best be directed.

The UK’s mission, codenamed Operation Shader, has already involved a combined force of hundreds of Special Forces working closely with Kurdish fighters as well as identifying targets for US fighter aircraft.

This week Toyota jeeps, now used by the SAS as they can be repaired in almost any country, were delivered to the Kurdish city of Irbil by two RAF C-17 aircraft, as special forces units prepare their role, currently described by the Ministry of Defence as ‘liaison teams’.

Typhoon aircraft, which first flew in action over Libya in 2012, are on standby to deliver Paveway laser guided bunker busters to degrade IS’s military capability and six aircraft are in Cyprus. 

According to officials, at least 600 troops will also be on standby to move into Irbil, should they be needed as part of a protection force or to provide additional training.

Two more forward operating bases may be established in the Middle East with an increased presence in Oman, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates all under consideration.

Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said the advance of Islamic State poses a ‘clear and immediate’ threat to British national security.

But in a Commons debate, he said there was a ‘qualitative difference’ between carrying out air strikes in Iraq and Syria. He told MPs: ‘The legal, technical and military differences make the proposition of air strikes more complicated in Syria.’
