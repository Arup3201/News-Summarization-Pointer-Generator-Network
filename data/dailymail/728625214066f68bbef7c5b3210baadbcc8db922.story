A former anorexic claims that she owes her life to her gym for banning her when her fitness obsession saw her shrink to a tiny five stone.

Caitlin Millar, 21, became addicted to the gym and skipping meals after she began to feel that she was unable to control anything else in her life.

While her exercise regime seemed healthy, Ms Miller was losing weight rapidly because she was consuming far fewer calories than her body needed.

It was only once she was banned from her gym that she realised how painfully thin she had become.

Now, she is finally on the road to recovery - and has been able to start living like any other student at a healthy 8st 9lbs.

Ms Millar, from Berkshire, said: ‘I was obsessed with being the best in everything I did whether it was in sports events or school, I had to be the most successful or I wasn’t happy.

‘When I started puberty I couldn’t deal with all the changes happening to my body that I couldn’t control.

‘I had always competed in running and when younger talent started emerging and I wasn’t the best anymore I couldn’t handle it.

‘My weight was something I could control completely and so I started skipping meals and working out more knowing that if I kept control of this then I might regain control of everything else in my life.

Ms Millar, who now weighs a healthy 8st 9lbs, says that she started to skip meals and over-exercise when she began to feel that she was losing control of her life

Ms Millar (pictured since her recovery) said: 'My weight was something I could control so I started skipping meals and working out more knowing that if I kept control of this then I might regain control of everything else'

‘When I started at university I became even worse because there was no one there to realise what I was doing or to make sure I didn’t skip meals.’

Ms Millar first began to obsess about her weight when, aged 15, training started to become more of a chore than a hobby and she could feel herself losing grasp of the perfect life she had crafted for herself.

Despite being a slim size eight, she felt this was not the best she could be and started skipping meals and heading to the gym as much as she possibly could.

She said: ‘Knowing that there were younger people coming into competing who were better than me was hard.

‘I wanted to regain control of something and so I started to cut meals out and added in more and more gym workouts.’

Aged 18, Ms Millar was a healthy size eight and weighed about eight-and-a-half stone – healthy for her 5ft 6ins frame.

But within a year, she had lost more than a third of her body weight, dropping to five stone.

Despite her friends and family mentioning their worries, she was determined to keep losing weight and keep control of that part of her life.

Ms Millar said: ‘I had been ill for about two years when one day I was pulled into the office at the gym at university by one of the staff.

‘He sat me down and said that he was going to have to ban me from the gym as people had been commenting on how worried they were about my weight.

‘I was furious to know that people had been talking about me behind my back but shocked that they were worried enough to make a comment.

‘I walked away from the gym feeling so embarrassed that I knew something had to change then and there.

‘I trawled the internet for somewhere that could help me and came across the Anorexia Nervosa Intensive Treatment Team.

‘They tailor-made a less terrifying diet plan based on my current food and exercise regimes which gradually built up over time.’

Ms Millar says that being banned from the gym came as a shock to her because she had not realised that she was so thin. As soon as this happened, she started to look for help

Ms Millar has now returned to full health and is able to enjoy university weighing a healthy 8st 9lbs. Her mother said: 'I am so proud that she managed to battle the illness and come out of the other side'

Ms Millar’s mother, Alison, said: ‘When Caitlin started becoming obsessed with her weight we knew that this was a battle that she had to face.

‘The more we tried to stop her from doing it the more we pushed her into doing it more.

‘We just had to hope that she got things under control herself.

‘Watching her so poorly was awful but all I could do was support her and try to look after her as much as I could.

‘I’m so happy she is better now though and back to her normal self.

‘I am so proud that she managed to battle the illness and come out of the other side a much better and happier person.’
