Suspended CBS Sports basketball analyst Greg Anthony reached a plea agreement with authorities on Wednesday to a charge of soliciting prostitution.

Anthony will have the misdemeanor charge dropped if he does 32 hours of community service, according to the spokeswoman for the District of Columbia Superior Court.

Anthony will perform the community service in Florida as part of the deferred prosecution agreement.

Details of former New York Knicks stars and sports commentator Greg Anthony's recent arrest for soliciting an undercover cop were recently released and revealed the events of the evening.

A police report showed that Anthony reached out to the officer through the website Backpage.com on January 16, and had them meet him at the Doubletree Hotel in Washington, DC where he was staying.

Then, after agreeing on a cost of $80 for sex, Anthony told the officer he wanted them to dress up.  

The officer arrived a little after 5:45pm, and almost immediately says to Anthony; 'So $80 for intercourse?'

Anthony is caught off guard, saying he does not want to talk about that, to which the officer responds; 'I just need to know so I don’t have any surprises.'

They then ask of Antony would like to have intercourse or oral sex, to which he says; 'Ummm yeah that's fine.'

Finally, just before backup is called in, the officer asks; 'You want me to dress up?'

'Oh yeah,' says Anthony. 

He is now scheduled to appear in court on February 2 and faces a misdemeanor charge of solicitation.

Anthony was in town that weekend to announce an NCAA game between Michigan State and Maryland for CBS.

The network, and Turner Sports, quickly announced they would be suspending Anthony.

'Greg Anthony will not be working again for CBS this season,' said a spokesperson. 

'I made a mistake,' Anthony said in a statement. 

'With this lapse of judgment, I embarrassed many, including myself. I will work to regain the trust that I have lost, and the first step is saying that I am sorry.'

Anthony, 47, started his NBA career with the Knicks and played in New York for four years before being picked up by the Vancouver Grizzlies in the 1995 NBA expansion draft.

He finished with the Milwaukee Bucks after 11 seasons in the NBA, averaging 7.3 points per game over his entire career.

Anthony has also been politically involved, appearing in a Nevada campaign ad for Mitt Romney during his 2012 presidential bid, calling the Republican Party nominee a 'no excuse kind of guy.' 

He is married to Dr. Chere Lucas Anthony, a dermatologist, and the couple have a 10-month-old daughter. 

Anthony also has three other children from previous relationships.
