Shuffling feet, buck passing, red faces... welcome to the latest twist in Liverpool’s striker saga.

Brendan Rodgers, a manager who apparently could do no wrong last season, now appears unable to get anything right.

The Anfield boss thought Daniel Sturridge, Mario Balotelli, Rickie Lambert and Fabio Borini would fulfil his team’s goal needs after allowing Luis Suarez to head to Barcelona.

Divock Origi, in action against Leighton Baines, is on loan at Lille, but Liverpool want him back at the club 

Origi was on target for Belgium in their 3-1 victory against Iceland earlier this week 

Origi (No 17) is congratulated by his Belgium team-mates after netting against Iceland on Wednesday 

Divock Origi has scored five goals for club and country this season - but was poor at Everton last month and has not scored in his last seven matches. 

Sturridge, 24 goals last season, fair enough and Rodgers was not to know he would be injured so early in the season. Sturridge’s one goal, against Southampton, was way back in August.

But £16million Balotelli was always going to be a gamble, Lambert a steady-eddie from the bench and, as for Borini, he has only ever been seen as a make-weight.

The trio have not scored in 998 minutes of Premier League action between them and that puts a question mark on another Rodgers decision.

He sanctioned a £10million splurge on Belgian teenager Divock Origi from Lille then loaned him back to the French club for the whole of this season.

£16million striker Mario Balotelli, in action against Chelsea, is yet to score for Liverpool in the Premier League

Fabio Borini and Rickie Lambert, a summer signing from Southampton, have struggled this season 

Now Rodgers wants the 19-year-old, who became the youngest scorer in Belgian World Cup history in the summer, for Liverpool. But there is one stumbling block – Lille will want compensation for cutting short the loan agreement.

Surely Liverpool should have thought of that before allowing him to go back? A call-back option in January is hardly unusual in these circumstances.

Origi was not cheap at the initial price but his purchase could now be very expensive indeed, more money needlessly spent.

The exciting young talent of Kenyan descent was being chased by the Africans earlier this year before Marc Wilmots stepped in and selected him for Brazil 2014.

Daniel Sturridge, in the stands for Liverpool's defeat against Chelsea, is closing in on a return to action 

Luis Suarez moved to Barcelona in the summer and Liverpool are sorely missing his services 

Brendan Rodgers is enduring a difficult season 

Pre-World Cup the talk was all about Romelu Lukaku and the injured Christian Benteke but it was Origi who caught the eye on the biggest stage of all.

This year he has scored five goals in French football and netted for his country in Belgium’s 3-1 win over Iceland this week.

And that makes him a valuable commodity on Merseyside right now, where things are going from bad to worse for Rodgers.

Compare Origi with the current Liverpool crop. Balotelli has two goals this season, neither of them in 685 minutes of league action. He has started in eight of his nine league appearances this season.

Last year the Italian scored 14 goals, which is not a bad return in Serie A, but it appears to have been a flash in the pan judging by his efforts so far for Liverpool.

Talking about flash in the pan, Borini, 23, first appeared on the radar in 2011 with six goals in nine appearances on loan at Swansea. Liverpool paid £10.5m to Parma for his services but he was never going to get a look-in with Suarez and Sturridge in full cry.

On loan at Sunderland last season, Borini netted nine goals for a struggling side. So far he has been a substitute in three of his four matches.

England winger Raheem Sterling is Liverpool's top scorer this season with three goals to his name

Lambert, 32, will be feeling the most wretched. He is a lifelong Liverpool fan and must have thought all his dreams had come true with his £4m switch from Southampton.

The England forward scored 14 goals for Saints last season but has been forced to take a back seat at Anfield. He has come on as a substitute in three of his four matches.

Last year Rodgers was in charge of a team who were title contenders thanks to the most devastating striking partnership in the Premier League.

Filling the hole left by Suarez was always going to be a big ask. But the fact of the matter is that Liverpool’s top scorer in the League so far is winger Raheem Sterling, with three goals and December approaching.

Time to send out an SOS to Origi?
