Tory said he did not realise what he had written was racist

Offensive remarks: Bob Frost, a Tory councillor with Dover District 
Council, has been suspended after calling rioters 'jungle bunnies' and has been axed from his position as a teacher

A grammar school teacher and Tory councillor has lost his job after calling rioters who brought havoc to the country last month ‘jungle bunnies’.

Bob Frost, a maths teacher at the prestigious Sir Roger Manwood’s grammar and boarding school, made the comment on the social networking site Facebook on August 7.

Soon afterwards the 49-year-old was suspended from his position as a Tory councillor on Dover District Council in Kent after fellow councillors spotted his offensive comments on the social networking site.

Then on Monday this week Mr Frost lost his job at the highly-regarded 912-pupil grammar school, the 96th oldest school in the UK, which was founded in 1563 by barrister Sir Roger Manwood.

Mr Frost wrote on August 10 - three days after writing ‘jungle bunnies’ in reference to the rioters on his Facebook wall - that he had been phoned up by a fellow councillor and accused of racism.

He posted: ‘I have just had a phone call that accused me of racism for my above posting.

‘Looking at the dictionary it would appear that the term jungle bunnies is pejorative and is a racist slur relating to African-Americans.

‘Needless to say I did not mean to use any offensive racist term and was referring to the urban jungle.’

He added: ‘As for the bunny bit it was originally ‘animals’, but I thought people might object to me calling fellow humans this so I chose something I thought was innocent and also cuddly.’

The councillor, who describes himself as a ‘right-wing libertarian’ then removed the post after another call from a fellow Tory and was suspended from the Conservative Party last month while an investigation into his conduct takes place.

A panel of district council members will meet to discuss Mr Frost’s comments before deciding on further action later this month. 

Head teacher Chris Morgan confirmed 
that Mr Frost had left the school, in Sandwich, Kent, on Monday this 
week, adding: ‘I can confirm that Mr Frost is no longer employed at Sir 
Roger Manwood’s School.

‘Mr Frost and the school have concluded by mutual agreement that this was in the best interests of both parties’.

At the time Mr Frost apologised ‘unreservedly’ for his comments.

He said: ‘What I said was wrong and I apologise unreservedly.

‘I am mortified by the offence that I have caused and have deleted these comments - I am very sorry.’

Deputy leader of the Tory-run council Sue Chandler said: ‘There is no place in our society for this kind of language.

‘We have therefore suspended Mr Frost from the Conservative Group pending an investigation.’

Local Tony Abbotts, 43, said: ‘This guy should be ashamed of himself.  

‘Everyone knows that jungle bunny is 
an offensive and racist remark and he has landed himself in very hot 
water by saying what he did.’

Mr Frost’s Facebook postings have 
attracted controversy in the past in particular comments he made about 
single mothers in Dover town centre.

He wrote: ‘Well, being in the Market 
Square you might ask how all the single mothers congregating with their 
push-chaired spawn are able to afford both their beer and their tattoos.
 I have a horrible idea I am paying for both.’

When it was put to Mr Frost that some 
of those mothers might be from his own constituency in north Deal, he 
responded: ‘While there is a certain demographic which may well fit the 
description in North Deal it is most unusual for them to waddle so far 
from their territory.’
