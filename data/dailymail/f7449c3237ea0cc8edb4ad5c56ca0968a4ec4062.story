The daughter of Spain's King Juan 
Carlos is under investigation for possible tax fraud and money 
laundering in a further blow to the reputation of Spain's royal family.

A judge today asked tax authorities for information regarding Princess Cristina's property and investments.

Palma de Mallorca court judge Jose Castro also requested information on her finances relating to her partnership with her husband Inaki Urdangarin in a firm called Aizoon.

The court recently withdrew a subpoena against the 47-year-old princess for questioning over the alleged embezzlement of public funds by Urdangarin.

However, it said she could still be called to answer questions regarding their finances.

Friday's decision comes after a year of health and image problems for the 75-year-old Juan Carlos, once one of Spain's most respected figures.

There was no immediate comment from the palace.

Blow: News of the investigation is a further blow to the Spanish Royal family after polls last month suggested support for the monarchy has fallen to a record low of 54 per cent. Spanish King Juan Carlos I is pictured

Cristina is the youngest of the King’s 
two daughters, behind Princess Elena, 49 . The King and wife Sofia also 
have a son, Prince Felipe, 45, who is heir to the throne.

Polls last month suggested that support for the monarchy has fallen to a record low of 54 per cent.

It also follows the revelation that Juan Carlos, 75, received a 2.2million Euro inheritance, deposited in three Swiss bank accounts, when his father Juan died on April 1, 1993.

Questions are now being asked as to whether the King, under fire for going elephant-hunting in Africa last year as recession continues to bite, paid the correct amount of tax on the sum.

The trip to Botswana only came to light after he fell and broke his hip, but sparked anger among Spain’s 5 million unemployed.

It also cost him his role as honorary president of the Spanish branch of the World Wildlife Fund and saw him issue an unprecedented apology.

It is in stark contrast to a decade ago when Juan Carlos was left virtually untouched by the media.

He was held in great respect for his role in brokering the transition from dictatorship to democracy following the death of General Franco in 1975.

It comes as Spain today returned to Tunisia a $5 million, 32-metre (105-foot) yacht belonging to the family of the country's deposed president Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali.

A Spanish court of appeal in February responded to a request from Tunisian prosecutors and confiscated the yacht once owned by Belhassen Trabelsi, the brother-in-law of deposed Tunisian President Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali.

Trabelsi fled Tunisia in the revolution that deposed the government in January 2011 and has asked for asylum in Montreal.

In April, Tunisia recovered a yacht from Italy belonging to Ben Ali's nephew Kais Ben Ali.

Tunisia is seeking to recover the billions allegedly embezzled by Ben Ali's family during his 23-year-rule.
