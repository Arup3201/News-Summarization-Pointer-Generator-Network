A woman is celebrating this Christmas after being reunited with her engagement ring which she had feared was lost forever.

Hayley Plack, 27, only realized her precious ring was missing after she had boarded a train leaving Washington D.C. on Friday.

The 1.1-carat oval diamond ring, a family heirloom, had been given to her on Thanksgiving Day by her now-fiance Andrew Frank.

After failing to find the ring on the train, Hayley panicked that she might never see it again.

The ring had belonged to her 32-year-old fiance’s grandmother and she had even insisted on being given the heirloom instead of a new ring, reports The Washington Post.

Despite her fiance's grave doubts that they would ever see the ring again, he tried to offer his future wife some encourage that  someone might find the ring and return it to them.

'Not everyone in the world is a criminal,' he told her.

Hayley quickly started a campaign to track down the ring using Craiglist ads, local blogs. She also inquired at local pawn shops in case someone had tried to sell it.

Fortunately for her, a 55-year-old man who lived just four doors down from the couple had found the diamond ring on the sidewalk in front of his apartment building.

Siranjan Kulatilake initially thought the ring belonged to a child because of the small size of the band.

He picked it up and hooked it onto his keys to keep it safe while he went about his work as a dog walker.

Back at his apartment he wondered what to do with the ring. ‘It’s obviously precious to someone,’ he said.

The next morning, his wife was out walking when she discovered one of the fliers Hayley had posted that read ‘Lost Engagement Ring. Reward Will Be Offered.’

The flier also included Hayley's phone number and so Kulatilake’s left her a voice mail message  delivering the good news that he may have found her lost ring.

Hayley was so overjoyed to get her ring back that when Kulatilake said he would prefer his reward to go to the Washington Humane Society, she gave them a check for $400 rather than the $50 he had requested.
