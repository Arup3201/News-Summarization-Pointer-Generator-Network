The new iphone will run on Android - and it has nothing to do with Apple.

A cheeky Brazilian technology company have made an attempt to cash in on the Apple gadget's cult status by marketing their own version.

And they have made a not too subtle attempt to circumvent the Silicon Valley firm's copyright by swapping the original's capital p for a lower case.

The new iphone... which runs on Android: Brazilian company Gradiente have tried to cash in on the Apple gadget's cult status with this cheekily named smartphone

Still, considering the legal crusade Apple launched against Samsung for allegedly copying its designs for the Galaxy range of smartphones, it is likely that the lawyers are sharpening their swords.

But, name aside, the new phone by São Paulo-based consumer electronics firm Gradiente is no iPhone clone.

It doesn't come anywhere the specs of Apple's flagship gadget, nor does it look much like it's namesake.

Dubbed the Gradiente iphone Neo One, using a 700MHz processor it splashes Android 2.3 Gingerbread onto a rather paltry 3.7in capacitive touchscreen display.

Head to head: Name aside, there are few similarities between the iphone and Apple's genuine article, right

The dual-sim phone comes complete with two cameras, front and back, with 0.3 and 5 megapixels resolution respectively, but no flash - although if you live in sun-soaked Brazil you might not need it.

Of course, iPhone users feeling a sting of jealousy towards their Android-wielding peers can always download Gmail, Chrome, Field Trip, YouTube Capture, Google Search, and now Google Maps, to get pretty much the same experience.

Perhaps the only good thing about the new iphone is the price. It retails 599 Brazilian Real - about £180 - and can be bought on an interest-free ten instalment plan.

As far as MailOnline knows, there is no plan to market the phone outside of Brazil.
