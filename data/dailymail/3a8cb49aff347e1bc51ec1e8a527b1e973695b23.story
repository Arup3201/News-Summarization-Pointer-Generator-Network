It's the morning after the Christmas party before, and there's an army of gremlins doing the hokey-cokey inside your dry and frazzled skull.

The children have started a steel kitchenware band, the dog's digesting the stair carpet, your phone is bleeping with a thousand 'HOW DID U GET HOME?' messages, and the idea of even switching on the kettle (let alone venturing into the office) makes your head spin.

Hallelujah, then, that the fine people at Grazing have come up with a solution: the Christmas party hangover cure, delivered directly to your home or workplace, that includes a breakfast roll, a vitamin shot, a fruit smoothie and, naturally, a packet of chocolate-covered bacon.

Don't let your hangover beat you, order the Christmas Party Hangover Cure from Grazing and knock your dehydration headache on the head before noon

The Christmas party season can be brutal, so make sure you have a couple of morning-after tricks up your sleeve

Research has shown that a lack of productivity the next day means that Christmas parties are more expensive for employers than just a bar bill and a plate of sausage rolls.

Grazing's Christmas Party Hangover Cure intends to save companies cash and leave staff feeling less prone to pulling a sickie.

The menu, created by a team of chefs in the city, features a fried egg and bacon buttie and provides a combination of nutrients, carbohydrates and protein to give s workers an energy boost.

The food - which costs £12.95 per box, with a minimum order of 10 - is transported and kept warm in Grazing's pioneering hot boxes.

Other items available from Grazing's menu include the Full Monty Breakfast, veggie sausage buttie, the American muffins and a mushroom omelette.

Don't knock chocolate-covered bacon until you've tried it, it's a curiously delicious mix of savoury and sweet, that indescribable umami flavour

Each box contains:

Beetroot, Apple, Avocado, Lime, Mango and Lemon Smoothie: Packed full of superfoods, this amazing smoothie is a favourite with celebrities. The fruits and vegetables contained are cold-pressed rather than heated, to maximise the nutrients, antioxidants and vitamins, and the natural sugars in this healthy mix rehydrate the body, getting the alcohol out of your system quicker.

Fausts Awake Potion: This
 miracle-in-a-bottle comprises amino acids, guarana, green tea, ginseng,
 Vitamins B and C and electrolytes. It works wonders for busy 
professionals by neutralising the effects of a hangover. It helps the 
body replace lost nutrients, banishing classic symptoms such as 
headaches and sluggishness that leave you feeling worse for wear.

Bacon & Fried Egg Buttie: Hangovers can cause blood sugar levels to drop. But hot, grilled British back bacon with a fried free-range egg, sandwiched in a soft white roll, with classic condiments (ketchup and HP sauce) on the side ought to help. Eggs and bacon are both rich in cysteine, an amino acid that aids the breakdown of toxins, while loading up on carbohydrates also helps redress the balance. Science aside, if an egg and bacon buttie doesn't help ease the pain of the morning after the night before, it will at the very least satiate even the most severe cases of munchies.

Bacon Chocolate: Can't decide between sweet or savoury? Not a problem. This seriously moreish combination of slow-cooked crispy bacon lardons - made from free-range British bacon - dipped in melted Fairtrade chocolate has the best of both. Sounds strange, but these chewy treats are a decadently delicious mid-morning pick-me-up. Plus, they're full of potassium, which gets depleted when you drink, causing you to feel sick and dehydrated. Just what the doctor ordered
