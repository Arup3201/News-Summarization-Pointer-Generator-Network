Algae-like structures found inside fragments of a meteorite which struck Sri Lanka last year prove that life exists elsewhere in the Universe, a new study claims.

A paper by an international team of scientists, their second on the subject, makes the extraordinary claim that electron microscope images of the rocks have revealed tiny fossilised life forms from outer space.

The authors are convinced that their findings offer firm evidence of panspermia, the hypothesis that life exists throughout the Universe and is spread by meteoroids, asteroids and planetoids.

From outer space? This electron microscope image

meteor which landed in Sri Lanka

Undeniably organic? The paper reiterates claims first made in January in an earlier study led by controversial scientist Chandra Wickramasinghe

However, sceptics are already lining up to pour scorn on their methodology.

MailOnline first reported in January the claims by Professor Chandra Wickramasinghe, of the Buckingham Centre for Astrobiology, that investigations of the meteorite had revealed evidence of alien life.

He is joint author of a new study, just published in the Journal of Cosmology, which reiterates the controversial claims on the basis of a new analysis of the rocks.

The paper tells how on the evening of December 29 last year a bright yellow fireball lit up the skies over Polonnaruwa, Sri Lanka, turning green as it disintegrated on entry into the Earth's atmosphere.

Blazing hot, sparkling fragments rained down on the villages and paddy fields below, according to reports, leaving some witnesses with burns and giving off fumes with a strong odour of asphalt.

Local police collected samples of the curious rocks and handed them to the Medical Research Institute of the Sri Lankan Ministry of Health, who then passed them on to researchers at Cardiff University for further analysis, the study says.

In total Jamie Wallis, of Cardiff's School of Mathematics, and colleagues received 628 fragments purportedly from the meteorite - three of which, they say, were 'clearly identified as possible meteorites'.

In the latest study, the researchers make the extraordinary claim than these three rocks contain fossilised biological structures fused into the rock matrix.

Furthermore, they say, their tests have ruled out the possibility of terrestrial contamination.

The team published electron microscope images of structures within the stones which they say show a complex, thick-walled, carbon-rich microfossil about 100 micrometres across.

Another image, they say, shows well-preserved flagella 100 micrometres long but only two micrometres in diameter.

Claims: Professor Chandra Wickramasinghe with the fragment of space rock in which the fossils were found

Evidence for ET? Critics say that even if the rock was indeed from outer space, research into it has failed to prove that the traces of life apparently found are not the result of contamination here on Earth

The researchers interpret that unusual
 long and thin configuration 'as indicating a low-gravity, low-pressure 
environment and rapid freeze-drying' - which could only happen in outer 
space.

A previous study, led
 by Professor Wickramasinghe and published in the Journal of Cosmology 
in January, also claimed to have found 'microscopic fossilized diatoms 
(a basic form of algae)' in the samples.

'We got it from the medical research institute in Sri Lanka,' Professor Chandra Wickramasinghe told MailOnline.

'They got hold of it on the 29th December, when a fireball was seen in the area.

'Thousands of people spotted it, and minutes after there was a meteorite fall over a rice field.

'Farmers who rushed to pick up these stones had their hands burnt, and women fainted, so local medical staff and police were summoned to cordon off the area to collect the stones.

'One of these was sent to us by colleagues.'

However, the professor admitted at the 
time they the paper was a rush job and he and his colleagues did not 
have time to conduct the necessarily analyses to confirm it was a 
meteorite.

To make up for that omission, in the latest study Wallis
 and his colleagues also measured the chemical make up of the samples to
 determine their origin, claiming that low levels of nitrogen rule our 
the possibility of contamination by modern organisms.

The
 researchers say their findings offer 'clear and convincing evidence 
that these obviously ancient remains of extinct marine algae found 
embedded in the Polonnaruwa meteorite are indigenous to the stones and 
not the result of post-arrival microbial contaminants.'

They
 add: 'The presence of fossilized biological structures provides 
compelling evidence in support of the theory of cometary panspermia 
first proposed over thirty years ago.'

The study backs up the claims of Professor Wickramasinghe's widely rubbished January paper which claimed to have found evidence of alien life in the same rocks.

Smoking gun? This scanning electron microscope image purports to show the tell-tale sign of a microscopic fossil

A mathematician by training, Professor
 Wickramasinghe, 74, claims microbes from outer space arrived on our 
planet from comets which then 'multiplied and seeded' to form our life 3.8billion years ago.

Chandra Wickramasinghe is notorious as the only scientist to argue against evolution during the 1981 Arkansas legal case against the teaching of creationism in schools.

The 74-year-old Sri Lankan-born British mathematician obtained a PhD from Cambridge under the supervision of the late Sir Fred Hoyle.

The pair went on to collaborate on a body of work some credit with providing the basis of the field of astrobiology.

Their joint work on the infrared spectra of interstellar grains led to developing the hypothesis of panspermia, which proposes that cosmic dust in space and comets is partly organic - and may have 'seeded' life on Earth.

They further contended that extraterrestrial life forms continue to enter the Earth's atmosphere, and may be responsible for epidemic outbreaks, new diseases, and the genetic novelty necessary for macroevolution.

In 2003 he was joint signatory on a letter sent to The Lancet which suggested that the virus which causes SARS may not come from chickens, but could in fact be from outer space.

He was head of Cardiff University's Centre for Astrobiology until two years ago, when funding was withdrawn and he was dismissed from his post.

He also believes that pathogens like the SARS virus arrived here from deep space.

'We are all aliens - we share a 
cosmic ancestry,' he said at the time of the original study's 
publication.

'Each time a new planetary system forms a few surviving 
microbes find their way into comets.

'These then multiply and seed other planets.

'These latest finds are just more evidence to point to the overwhelming fact that life on Earth began on other worlds.'

Professor Wickramasinghe was head of Cardiff University's 
Centre for Astrobiology until two years ago when funding for the 
department was withdrawn and he was dismissed from his post.

The
 controversial professor, the only scientist to testify against 
evolution in the famous 1981 creationist trial in Arkansas, has since 
carried on the project as a private company and charity.

Critics
 have already lined up to rubbish the latest study's claims and to 
suggest that the methodology of the researchers was also flawed.

Phil
 Plait, author of Slate's Bad Astronomy blog, said: 'I read the paper, 
and really it’s more of the same as from the first paper.

'In
 some ways, it’s even shakier; they provide lots of technical data that 
gives their work a veneer of credibility, but when you look a bit deeper
 you find they didn’t do a lot of critically necessary tests to 
establish the veracity of their claims.'

Controversial: Professor Wickramasinghe, left, says the still-smoking rocks were found after they fell in Sri Lanka, right, after a dramatic meteor shower

Plait
 claims the tests undertaken by Wallis and his colleagues did not go far
 enough to confirm that the rock samples they analysed were in fact from
 the meteor that appeared over Sri Lanka in December, and, even if they 
were from space, the analysis was insufficient to eliminate the 
possibility of contamination here on Earth.

Professor Chandra Wickramasinghe is a leading proponent of panspermia, the hypothesis that life exists throughout the Universe and is spread by meteoroids, asteroids and planetoids.

Panspermia proposes that life forms that can survive the effects of space, such as extremophiles, become trapped in debris that is ejected into space after collisions between asteroids and planets that harbour life.

These life-forms may travel dormant for an extended amount of time before colliding randomly with other planets or intermingling with protoplanetary disks.

If met with ideal conditions on a new planet's surfaces, the bacteria become active and the process of evolution begins, it is believed.

He
 points out that another meteorite fell to Earth in the same area in 
2004 and any samples picked up could have in fact been from this event -
 long enough ago for the rocks to have become thoroughly contaminated.

And
 he adds that nowhere in the latest paper do the researchers indicate 
that they have undertaken the usual precautions to minimise findings 
which may have been caused by contamination.

'So,
 they find some rocks, they claim (without enough  evidence) that 
they're meteorites, and they claim (without evidence) they're from a 
recent meteorite fall,' says Plait. 'They find diatoms, and they claim 
(without controlling for contamination) that not only these diatoms came
 from space, but that meteorites like this seeded Earth with life.

'Which is more likely: that, or that they found a rock from Earth that already had diatoms in it?'

When Professor Wickramasinghe's 
January paper was published, Monica Grady, professor of Planetary 
Sciences at the Open University’s Faculty of Science, told MailOnline 
she found the whole thing ‘laughable’.

‘There are serious inconsistencies with the data presented in the paper,' she said.

‘The most important is that the rock they have found is yet to be proven to be a meteorite.

‘Until
 that is done, no credence can be placed on the findings presented, 
especially when they are published in a non-mainstream journal.'
