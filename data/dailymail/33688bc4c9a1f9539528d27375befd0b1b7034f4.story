And so the improbable journey continues. Mexico needed favours to reach the World Cup finals, now they are looking increasingly like a team nobody will want to play.

Had it not been for a late goal scored by the United States against Panama last October, Mexico would have missed out but they have taken full advantage of that good fortune and sailed into the knockout stages last night with an exhilarating 3-1 win over 10-man Croatia. 

Setting the tone was Rafael Marquez, Mexico’s most decorated footballer, who scored a captain’s goal midway through the second half of a tense encounter to tee up a last-16 clash with Holland. Andres Guardado settled matters shortly after with a fine finish after a rapid counter-attack against a Croatia side who lost their discipline when Ante Rebic was sent-off for a late challenge.

Given what was at stake and the small margins separating these nations 
in Group A, the contest was spiky and feisty almost from the first 
whistle, with players from both sides testing the patience of referee 
Ravshan Irmatov.

Cynical fouls prevented the game from developing a 
rhythm and Croatia’s problems were exacerbated by the system Mexico 
played, with their three central defenders — marshalled supremely by the
 veteran Rafael Marquez — not allowing Croatia’s forwards to flourish.

Luka
 Modric was also nullified, meaning Ivica Olic and Mario Mandzukic 
barely got a sight of Guillermo Ochoa’s goal. More worrying for Croatia,
 the longer the half went on, the more Mexico clambered on top and they 
came closest to breaking the deadlock through Hector Herrera.

Herrera
 deserved a goal. When the ball dropped to him 25 yards out, he only had
 one thought on his mind and he caught his shot flush, sending a 
left-foot drive fizzing past Croatia keeper Stipe Pletikosa. Much to 
Herrera’s frustration, though, his effort cannoned off the crossbar. 

Roared
 on by a partisan crowd in Recife, Mexico started to ask more and more 
questions of Croatia and their finish to the first period was strong but
 they were unable to find a way past Pletikosa, who stood firm when 
Miguel Layun had a chance in the 41st minute.

A similar pattern 
ensued after the restart. Modric, belatedly, started to have an 
influence and forced a corner with one jinking run and shot but still 
Mexico would not be moved, as Marquez — a Champions League winner in his
 prime with Barcelona — would not let their defence lose focus.

That 
was crucial as in the last 25 minutes, they ran riot. Marquez set them 
on the way with a header to break Croatia’s spirit, Guardado secured the
 victory with a thumping finish shortly after and then substitute Javier Hernandez raised hopes of actually winning Group A with another header.

Fernandinho’s
 goal for Brazil in Brasilia, coupled with a consolation strike from 
Ivan Perisic, ended that prospect but it is clear Mexico have the 
potential to make the most of this unexpected opportunity.
