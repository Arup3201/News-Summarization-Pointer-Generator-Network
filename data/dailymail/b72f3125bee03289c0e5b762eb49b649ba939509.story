A pop-up chapel has been erected outside Manchester Cathedral as a place for worshippers to pray while their parish is being renovated.

The 70ft wooden church has been propped up next to the city's Anglican cathedral to make room for the congregation while a new heating system is installed inside.

The 300-capacity structure, made from lightweight wood and recycled decking, will be the spiritual home for the local Church of England community from April 8 until November and regular services will be held in the 'church on the street'.

Work will be done on the cathedral's creaky 1950s underfloor pipes and a powerful 'ground-sourced' heating system will be introduced to make the building the UK's greenest cathedral.

The system will store heat and cold air several metres below the ground.

The temporary chapel on Victoria Street, Manchester, has been designed by local firm Nikal and is partly modelled on the main cathedral itself.Â 

It has been designed with 'church-style' windows with coloured glass and is surrounded by an urban garden with a playground and community allotments.

The Very Rev Rogers Govender, Dean of Manchester said: 'These developments are very welcome as they will attract people into the area and will also make the area look beautiful, especially as we move into spring and the coming holiday season.

'I would like to thank everyone for their efforts.'

After Easter, the cathedral's regular and Sunday morning services will be held in the temporary building, although other services and activities normally held at the cathedral may also take place at nearby parishes, including St Stephens and Sacred Trinity in Salford.
