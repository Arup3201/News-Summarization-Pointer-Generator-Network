NBC has come under fire yet again for its Olympics programming - this time for editing out highly-anticipated rock acts from its coverage of the extravagant closing ceremony on Sunday night.

Hundreds of enraged viewers across the U.S. vented their frustration on Twitter after the network cut out performances by Ray Davies, The Who and Muse for an hour-long preview of Animal Practice.

This selective editing meant NBC's coverage ended as it began, after the network chose to cut out a moving tribute to the victims of the 2005 London bombings from the Opening Ceremony.

Interrupted: Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend of The Who perform during the Closing Ceremony. Their performance was delayed until after NBC showed an hour-long preview of a new show

Cut: Matt Bellamy of Muse plays at the ceremony on Sunday. The band's performance was cut for U.S. viewers even though it made the official song for the Olympics

'I still don't understand, it's a tape 
delay, so can't you do the math in advance? Why do you need to cut off 
the closing ceremony? #nbcfail,' Raj Sarkar complained on Twitter.

Actor Nate Barlow added: 'Why #nbcfail ranks last: no better way to turn people off a 
new show than to preempt @thewho & other rock legends for it.'

Viewers
were astounded when the network instead showed a preview of its new comedy, Animal 
Practice episode. Some acts were cut entirely, but The Who's performance was shown an hour later.

Music fans were left disappointed by the absence of Muse, who 
performed their official Olympics song, Survival, while backed by a massive 
choir.

Ousted: A performance by musician Ray Davies was also cut from the NBC broadcast

Dazzling: The Who plays for thousands of fans at the Closing Ceremony - but millions more in the U.S. had to wait to watch the performance. It is just the latest in a string of gaffes by NBC during the Olympics

Twitter user Alex Heberling pointed out: 'Do they not know that Muse did the OFFICIAL SONG OF THE LONDON 2012 GAMES? UGH. #NBCFail.'

'Their broadcast was horrible! No Muse 
with the OFFICIAL song of the Olympics. Who made that call? @NBC 
#NBCfail,' user LoriAndJava wrote.

NBC, which streamed the ceremony live on its Olympics website, had urged viewers on its Twitter page to stay tuned for 'The Who after @Animal Practice :)'.

It concluded with: 'And that's a wrap! Thanks for enjoying 
the 2012 #Olympics with us!'

The network came under repeated fire throughout the 16 days of the Games for a string of gaffes.

Outrage: Viewers lambasted NBC on Twitter for cutting out the highly-anticipated musical acts

It started off on the wrong foot by editing out a tribute for the victims of the 2005 London 
bombings from the Opening Ceremony coverage, deeming it 'not suited for 
American audiences'.

Twitter was also flooded with gripes 
about NBC keeping marquee events off the air until prime-time, the broadcast that brings in the most viewers 
and advertising revenue for the network.

Sports fans were particularly enraged when the 100m men's sprint - won by Jamaican runner Usain Bolt - was delayed by nearly six hours for American audiences.

And although NBC had defended its choice by telling viewers they could watch it streaming live on the internet, the page failed to load correctly, leaving thousands fuming.

'Usain Bolt outruns the NBC live stream's buffer!' one Twitter user joked.

Poor choice: Instead, NBC chose to air an hour-long preview of its new show, Animal Practice

Offensive: NBC also came under fire for showing an advert of a monkey competing in gymnastics shortly, pictured, after African American Gabby Douglas won the gold medal

NBC was also forced to apologise after 
airing an ad featuring a monkey performing gymnastics, right after 
showing the performance of Gabby Douglas, the first African-American to 
win Olympic gold.

In another instance, it spoiled the results of U.S.  swimmer Missy Franklin's gold 
medal-winning race when it ran an advert for the Today show revealing the 
outcome before it was telecast that night.

And
it came under fire for filing a complaint over tweets by British 
journalist Guy Adams, whose Twitter account was suspended after he 
lambasted the network's coverage.

Jim
Bell, the Olympics executive producer who is overseeing the coverage, 
repeatedly stood by the delayed viewing, saying the prime time 
viewers take priority - especially when the network, which paid $1.2 
billion to acquire the Olympics rights, was desperately trying to avoid a
loss.

'When a company invests the kind of 
money that we have in the Olympics we have absolutely every right to 
protect that investment,' he said in a previous interview with Media 
Bistro.

Frustrating: Sports fans were also annoyed when NBC delayed Usain Bolt's 100m win by nearly six hours

Bad start: NBC edited out a tribute to the victims of the 2005 bomb attacks in London in the Opening Ceremony

Shock: Viewers flocked to Twitter to vent their anger - but Bell said the cut was down to time constraints

'There's still a huge audience out there of people who want to watch this stuff at a time when it is convenient for them, when there are mass audiences, when people can gather around and watch TV, and one of the last great family viewing events out there.

'This is one thing you watch together. And if you kind of end up giving it away on TV you're not protecting your investment and you're not serving the audience and you're not serving the affiliates and you're not serving the advertisers.'

Despite audiences frustrations, the 2012 London Olympics were the second most watched event in American TV history, early Nielsen ratings have shown.

In total, 210.5 million people tuned in to the Olympics on the first 14 days, across NBCUniversalâ€™s networks that include NBC, NBC Sports Network, MSNBC, CNBC, Telemundo and Bravo.

The 2012 viewership surpassed the audience of 209 million who watched the 1996 Atlanta Olympics but lagged behind the 215 million U.S. viewers for the 2008 Beijing Games.
