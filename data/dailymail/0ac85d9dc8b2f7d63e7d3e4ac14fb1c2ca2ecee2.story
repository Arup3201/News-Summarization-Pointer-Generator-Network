Investment firms are having to raise their starting salaries to entice the top graduates in the wake of the banking scandals.

One partner said that 'banker bashing' was affecting decisions made by university leavers about whether to enter the City.

As a result, the top banks have upped their graduate pay levels by around 5 per cent to between £45,000 and £50,000 a year.

Graduates are being offered higher starting salaries by the top investment firms because many are having second thoughts about joining the industry amid the banking scandals

They already offer around an extra 20 per cent over other sectors.

This year, the student union and university debates have strongly criticised the fallout from the Libor scandal and the money-laundering charges levied at HSBC and Standard Chartered.

Jon Terry, a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers who advises the top banks on pay levels, told the Daily Telegraph: 'There is no doubt that "banker bashing" and the scandals at the banks are impacting graduate decisions about going into the City.

'The importance of reputation seems to have gone up tremendously.

'Investment banks are generally paying around 5 per cent more this year, even though investment bank graduates are paid far more than other graduates.'

Dr Curly Maloney, the founder of headhunters Maloney Search, said graduates were now thinking of 'longer studies or professional services' rather than the City.

Barclays agreed to pay £290million in a settlement with U.S. and UK regulators after allegations the bank rigged Libor rates in a scandal which cost chief executive Bob Diamond his job.

HSBC and Standard Chartered have made multi-million payouts over the money-laundering controversies.

Standard Chartered's shares fell more than 20 per cent after it was branded a 'rogue institution' by New York's State financial regulator.
