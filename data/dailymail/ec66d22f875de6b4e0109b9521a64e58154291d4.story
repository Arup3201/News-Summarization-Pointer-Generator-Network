The British motor industry received a new boost today as Japanese car giant Nissan announced  a £250million investment to build a brand new luxury hatchback in Sunderland –  called Infiniti.

The cash boost will mean 1,000 extra UK jobs of which 280 will be directly at the plant in Tyne and Wear to build the new upmarket Infiniti Etheria car – a rival to Audi’s A3 – from 2015.

About 60,000 Infiniti Etherias costing from around £20,000 will be built at the Sunderland factory each year pushing  the current 500,000 record production figure achieved this week even higher.

Nisan said it marked ‘the first new car brand to be manufactured in the UK on this scale in 23 years.’

The factory which employs more than 6,000 currently builds the Nisan Qashqai, Note, Juke, and starts in the New Year with production of the electric Leaf.

The deal was hailed by Prime Minister David Cameron as ‘another vote of confidence for UK manufacturing’, by Nissan as ‘a milestone’, Business Secretary Vince Cable as ‘ a strong endorsement of the quality of Britain's car industry.’

The luxury Infiniti brand is to 
Nissan what Lexus is to Toyota – the younger but more upwardly-mobile 
premium or ‘posh’ branch of the family.

The new global model will be 
manufactured solely at Sunderland and is being developed with help from 
Nissan's design centre in London and technical centre in Cranfield. It 
will then be exported around the world, said the firm.

Milestone: David Cameron called the UK production of Inifiniti a 'vote of confidence'

The
North East plant will build more than half a million cars this year, 
the first UK manufacturer to achieve this milestone, said Nissan: ‘By 
the end of this week we anticipate making 510,000 units in 2012.’

But the deal is also the result of some internal fast-footwork by Nissan.

Originally,
Sunderland was to have built a Ford-Focus sized Nissan-badged hatchback
– under a deal announced in Yokohama by Prime Minister David Cameron 
during his visit to Japan in March.

The
Infiniti, by contrast, was to have been built in Austria by 
Magna-Steyr. Nissan bosses then decided to move the Infiniti to 
Sunderland ‘because of the high quality of the workmanship’, said a 
spokesman.

But there wasn’t room to do both, so the Nissan hatchback is 
to go elsewhere. However, the new investment is double the original 
£127million. But an £8.2m taxpayer subsidy from UK Government’s Regional
Growth Fund agreed for the Nissan badged car will have to be reapplied 
for under the new deal.

Nissan said: ’Because of capacity 
limitations at Sunderland, securing the new Infiniti will mean that a 
C-segment hatchback previously announced for the plant in March will be 
manufactured elsewhere. Sourcing for this vehicle will be decided and 
announced at a later date.’

Colin
Dodge, Nissan's executive vice-president and chief performance officer,
said: ‘This milestone, our first premium product to be manufactured at 
Sunderland, reconfirms our commitment to UK manufacturing and the 
ongoing success of the plant which is moving up the value chain.

‘Just
as important, the new Infiniti, which will be exported around the 
world, is being developed with help from our London design centre and 
our European Technical Centre.’

Prime Minister David Cameron said: ‘This investment is excellent news for the North East and another vote of confidence for UK manufacturing. The continued success of Nissan in the UK demonstrates the strength of the car industry here, and its importance, as we rebalance and grow the economy.’

He added: ’This announcement shows how the car industry in partnership with the Government continues to win important long term investment projects, in a tough competitive sector; helping the UK to get ahead in the global race.’

Business Secretary Vince Cable, who will attend a ceremony in Sunderland to mark today’s announcement, said: ‘Sunderland will be the only place in the world to make this new premium compact car.

‘Nissan in the UK goes from strength to strength. Not only will the new car be made here and exported all over the world, the UK has already contributed to its design and development.’

He added: ‘Today's news is a strong endorsement of the quality of Britain's car industry which is creating jobs, taking on apprentices and contributing to building a stronger economy. The auto sector is living up to being one of the great success stories of our industrial strategy and a testimony to government and private sector working together in close partnership.’

Production started at Nissan’s Sunderland plant in September 1986 since when investment has topped more than  £3.5bn.

Infiniti was launched in 1989 in the United States and in the UK and Europe from 2008.
