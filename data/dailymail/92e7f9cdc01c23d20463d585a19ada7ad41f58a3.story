Jailed teacher Jeremy
 Forrest has given his blessing to his schoolgirl lover's new 
relationship with another teacher, it was reported today.

The
 31-year-old, who is currently serving a five-and-a-half-year sentence 
for abducting the girl, then 15, learned of the relationship after 
reading newspaper reports yesterday.

The
 news had been expected to come as a devastating blow to Forrest, who 
was arrested in September 2012 when the runaways were spotted in 
Bordeaux after a week on the run.

'All he has ever wanted for her is for her to be happy': Jeremy Forrest, 31, left is understood to have given his blessing to his schoolgirl lover's new relationship with a 20-year-old teaching assistant

But jilted Forrest has accepted that she has moved on, a source told The Sun.

'Jeremy's
 view is that if she wants to move on that's fine - he gives it his 
blessing. He hopes she is happy with this new man,' the source said.

'All he has ever wanted for her is for her to be happy.'

Just
 last month it was claimed the girl had written to Forrest in prison to say 
she still loved him and wanted to rekindle their relationship when he 
has served his sentence.

But
 now she is said to be 'ridiculously happy' after falling for a 
20-year-old PE teaching assistant and part-time security guard.

Jilted: The news had been expected to come as a blow to Forrest who is currently serving a five-and-a-half year sentence for abducting the girl

The
 girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, posted a picture showing 
the new man giving her a kiss on the cheek while she sticks her tongue 
out, reported the Sun on Sunday.

And
 her mother is understood to wholeheartedly approve of the relationship,
 telling the newspaper: 'He is really nice and we have welcomed him into
 our family and I am very happy for my daughter.'

Because the girl is now 16 and the new teacher does not work at her current school, their relationship is not illegal.

Friends of the teenager are also said to be keen on the new man and see him as a positive influence.

The
 pair are said to have connected over a shared love of music and 
exchanged a series of flirty tweets before things became more serious in
 mid-February.

They reportedly spent two nights together last week and have bought tickets to see one of their favourite bands.

Last
 week she posted on Twitter that she was annoyed when people said that 
when someone moves on it meant they did not love the person they were 
with before.

Forrest, who 
taught at Bishop Bell School in East Sussex, first kissed the girl when 
she was 14. The pair had sex after she turned 15.

When police were alerted they fled to France by ferry, travelling under false names.

He
 was spotted and arrested eight days later. Last June at Lewes Crown 
Court he was convicted of sex offences and abduction, and jailed.

Afterwards
 the girl said: ‘I love Jeremy so much. I want to spend the rest of my 
life with him and maybe once he’s out, we can marry and have children.’

Forrest
 began his relationship with the girl on a school trip to Los Angeles 
when she was 14 and was seen holding her hand on the plane – something 
she claims he was doing to comfort her as she was struggling with 
bulimia.

She opened up to 
him about the break-up of her parents’ marriage before he kissed her in a
 classroom. She said they would have sex in his Ford Fiesta or hotels, 
which they would check into as Mr and Mrs Forrest.

They were on the run for eight days before being found in Bordeaux where he was arrested in front of her.

He was convicted of child abduction and five counts of sexual activity with a child at Lewes Crown Court in June.
