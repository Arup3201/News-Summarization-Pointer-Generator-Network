Morning walk: Scientists in Chicago say people who get out and about in the morning are thinner than those who go outside later in the day

As ideas for losing weight go, this is certainly a bright one.

Scientists say that people who get out and about in the morning are thinner than those who go outside later in the day.

They believe that bright morning light helps synchronise the body clock, which then helps regulate metabolism.

The US researchers gave 54 men and women wrist monitors that recorded details of their light exposure, sleep and exercise for a week. The volunteers also kept a diary of all the food they ate.

Crunching the results revealed that those who were exposed to bright light before noon were lighter than others – even when exercise, diet and sleep were taken into account.

The researchers, from Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, said that the timing, intensity and duration of the light were all important.

They say it would be hard to get enough light indoors and recommended we get out, even on a cloudy day.

Just 20 to 30 minutes is enough.

The study’s senior author Dr Phyllis Zee said: ‘Light is the most potent agent to synchronise your internal body clock that regulates circadian rhythms, which in turn also regulate energy balance.

‘If a person doesn’t get sufficient light at the appropriate time of day, it could de-synchronise your internal body clock, which is known to alter metabolism and can lead to weight gain.

‘The message is that you should get more bright light between 8am and noon.’

Researcher Dr Kathryn Reid said: ‘Just like people are trying to get more sleep to help them lose weight, perhaps manipulating light is another way to lose weight.’

She recommends that office workers take the chance to go outside during their breaks and that lighting is improved in schools and work places.

The journal PLoS ONE reports that isn’t entirely clear how bright morning light keeps us trim but it is known that light affects metabolism and feelings of hunger and satiety.
