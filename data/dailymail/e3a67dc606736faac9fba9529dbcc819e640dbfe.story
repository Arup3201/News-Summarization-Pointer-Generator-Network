Nathaniel Clyne is one of the best right-backs Southampton manager Ronald Koeman has ever coached.

Calls are growing for the highly-talented 23-year-old to follow in the footsteps of Saints team-mates past and present by getting England recognition.

Clyne has improved markedly since arriving at St Mary's in 2012, and has been a key component in what has been the Premier League's tightest defence this term.

Ronald Koeman has praised full-back Clyne

Saints boss Koeman knows a thing or two about defending himself and has seen few better than the former Crystal Palace full-back.

'In my opinion, Clyne is one of the best right full-backs that I've had in my teams during the last 15 years,' he said.

'That means a lot because I like to play with offensive right and left full-backs and he has that qualities, he's fast and gives good crosses.

'I'm happy but I'm not in the position to tell the national coach of somebody else about him.

'He shows his quality from the beginning of the season and if he continues like that he will get a call, for sure.

'If he shows his qualities game by game, then I'm sure he will get finally a call to be a national player.'

Clyne and his team-mates have conceded just three top-flight goals so far this term and head into this weekend's clash with QPR second in the Premier League.

Only Chelsea are above Saints and, despite them having conceded seven goals, Koeman pointed to Jose Mourinho as the mentality to replicate.

'To win points, to win games, it starts at the back,' he said. 'It starts in the defence.

'That's the reason that we bought Fraser Forster because he is a fantastic goalkeeper with a future in the club.

'We have a strong defence. It's all about organisation in the team and one time a week we do unit training. We make three groups and we have training for the defenders, for midfielders and for forwards.

'That is an example of how we try to do work the whole week. Building a house you don't start at the top, you start at the bottom. That makes winning teams.

'Jose Mourinho has shown that for a long time in the way he is doing that.'

Judging by that, QPR look to be in for a tough season given they have conceded 11 goals already, with eight of those coming in their two away games.

Saints will be looking for a similarly big win on Saturday, with the pressure likely to come on the west Londoners' defence as the hosts go for a sixth successive win in all competitions.

Steven Caulker is a key figure for QPR at the back and a player Koeman rejected suggestions he had moved to bring in during the summer from Cardiff.

The Dutchman also denied having an interest in compatriot Leroy Fer, who he spent a brief spell coaching at Feyenoord before the midfielder moved onto Twente, Norwich and, now, the Rs.

'We have enough midfield players,' Koeman said. 'That's not the position where we have to look for new players.

'He's a great player. I have him as the coach and I know his qualities. He's still a young player, but with a lot of potential and that's true.'
