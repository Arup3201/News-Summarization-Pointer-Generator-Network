Kim Silva is a retired teacher for the American School for the Deaf.

Silva and her husband, John, both having hearing difficulties, and in 2009 fell in love with a deaf Siamese cat they found on the website PetFinder.

Paws up: In a video posted online, and 

Silva told The Huffington Post: 'Since my daughters learned signs from infancy, I had ideas how to introduce sign.

She added: 'Guess I missed the kiddies so I began teaching the kitties!'

Silva said it took time, but after dedicating herself to the task, she eventually got there.

The cats are now able to understand her signs for words such as 'stay', 'sit', 'shake', 'dance' and many more.

'Cats become much more interactive with people because they want to communicate,' Silva said. 

'Bobcat was a ''pillow that ate'' before he learned sign.

'My cats will also do tricks with other people who sign with them.' 

The video of Silva and her signing was made by her son-in-law, Tim O'Donnell, and originally posted to YouTube.
