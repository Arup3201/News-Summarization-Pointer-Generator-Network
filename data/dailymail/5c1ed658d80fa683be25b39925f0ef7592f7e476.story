American Airlines have become the first and only US carrier to offer travellers first-class seats on domestic flights.

Up until now, passengers have only had the choice between economy and business-class flights when flying between US destinations.

However, anyone wanting to enjoy the benefits of American Airline's premium seats between Los Angeles and New York will have to shell out up to $8,000 (£4,895) for a return trip between the cities.

American airline's 10 first class seats in their A321T planes include fully lie-flat beds and a 15.4-inch TV

In comparison, Delta Airlines were yesterday offering their business-class seats for a round trip between the two cities at $5,016 (£3,070).

But for the extra money, passengers who want the first-class experience for the six-hour journey will have access to a host of extra facilities.

They will be offered private berths, three-course meals boasting shrimp, scampi and even vented compartments that can house a customer's pets.

The seats are 27.4 inches wide, compared with 19 inches business class and 17.7 in economy cabins

The airline's 10 first class seats in their A321T planes include fully lie-flat beds and a 15.4-inch touchscreen monitor.

Travellers will be able to choose from 200 films, 180 TV programmes, 350 radio stations and 20 games in addition to having access to onboard Wi-Fi, powerpoints and USB ports.

They will also be given top of the range Bose, Noise Cancelling headphones.

The spacious seats are 27.4 inches wide, compared with 19 inches business class and 17.7 in economy cabins, while they will also feature additional legroom.

Three course meals will also feature a menu of beef filet and butternut squash gnocchi and a selection of award-winning wines. By comparison, economy-class passengers are served £6 chicken sandwiches.

The premium service has been introduced as part of a bid to return American Airlines to its role as an industry innovator in the 1970s and 1980s

They will also be given free travel bags filled with Akhassa beauty products.

First-class pets are cosseted as well.

The two berths at the front bulkhead each have a space with a vented door to hold a kennel or carrying case for takeoff and landing. 

It has already been dubbed the 'Paris Hilton compartment', in honour of the celebrity who often flies with her dogs.

Privacy and extra workspace in the first-class berths attracted Matthew Bennett, who used frequent-flier miles to book one way on one of the airline's 17 A321T aircraft.

'The difference between business and first-class is akin to the difference between economy and business,' said Bennett, who is based in California, and publishes 'First Class Flyer,' an advice newsletter on redeeming loyalty awards and elite upgrades. 'It's pretty darn significant.'

A321T flights began in January, and President Scott Kirby said the service generated an enthusiastic response at a recent investor conference near Los Angeles.

'I bet I had at least six to eight people seek me out at the conference to tell me how great the product was,' he said. 'It's a huge hit with our customers and doing well.'

The premium service has been introduced as part of a bid to return American Airlines to its role as an industry innovator in the 1970s and 1980s.

Industry experts now say other US arlines could follow suit and add first-class cabins to their cross-country services.

'Once somebody disrupts a market with a product of that quality, the others are going to want to analyse it and see if they want to follow suit,' said John Beauvais, president-corporate brands for Flight Centre USA and Latin America. 

'They certainly are not ignoring it.'
