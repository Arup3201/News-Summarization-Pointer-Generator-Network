Team news

Chelsea 

Diego Costa will be given every opportunity to prove his fitness ahead of the Premier League clash with Swansea after withdrawing from Spain duty with a hamstring injury.

Manager Jose Mourinho may opt to hand Loic Remy his debut, following his signing from QPR, with Wednesday's Champions League fixture with Schalke in mind.

Mourinho reported no further injury problems ahead of the fixture with the Swans, who like the Blues have begun the season with three wins from three games.

Provisional squad: Courtois, Cech, Ivanovic, Luis, Fabregas, Zouma, Ake, Ramires, Oscar, Hazard, Drogba, Mikel, Schurrle, Salah, Remy, Costa, Matic, Willian, Schwarzer, Cahill, Terry, Azpilicueta, Christensen, Boga, Baker.

Swansea 

Swansea striker Wilfried Bony will be checked before manager Garry Monk finalises selection for the top-of-the-table match with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.

Bony was part of the Ivory Coast side which lost an Africa Cup of Nations qualifier in Cameroon on Wednesday evening and Monk will consider the effects of that long journey on the 25-year-old before deciding whether to name an unchanged side for the fourth successive Barclays Premier League game.

Bafetimbi Gomis stands by should Bony be rested to the bench and Marvin Emnes could join the squad for the first time this season after hamstring trouble but midfielder Leon Britton has been ruled out for at least four more weeks with a knee injury.

Provisional squad: Fabianski, Rangel, Amat, Williams, Taylor, Ki, Shelvey, Dyer, Routledge, Sigurdsson, Bony, Tremmel, Fernandez, Tiendalli, Carroll, Montero, Gomis, Emnes, Bartley, Richards, Fulton, King, Kingsley, Sheehan.

Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

Chelsea have won all three  Premier League home meetings with Swansea and are unbeaten in six overall in the competition versus the Swans (W4 D2).

The Swans did win 2-0 at Stamford Bridge in the League Cup in January 2013, however, with Michu and Danny Graham on the scoresheet.

Didier Drogba scored on his one previous appearance against the Swans, in a 4-1 home win back in September 2011.

Diego Costa has scored four goals in three Premier League games; Fernando Torres took 39 games to reach this figure for Chelsea.

Swansea have never beaten Chelsea in the Premier League but memorably triumphed at Stamford Bridge in a League Cup match in 2013, with Danny Graham taking the ball past Ross Turnbull before scoring in a 2-0 win

Only Eden Hazard (7) and Fernando Torres (5) got more goal assists for Chelsea in 2013-14 than Cesc Fabregas already has in 2014-15 (4).

Chelsea and Swansea are the only two sides yet to drop a point this season (P3 W3).

Gylfi Sigurdsson has scored one and assisted four of Swansea’s six league goals this season. He has assisted as many goals in three appearances this term as he did in 58 for Tottenham overall in the Premier League.

The Swans have already claimed 21 per cent of their entire points total from last season (9 of 42) in only three games.

Indeed Garry Monk’s side have won four consecutive games for the first time in the Premier League.

This is only the second time in Premier League history that the top two sides in the table have faced off as early as this in the campaign (MD4). Then-leaders Chelsea beat second place Tottenham 2-0 in August 2005.
