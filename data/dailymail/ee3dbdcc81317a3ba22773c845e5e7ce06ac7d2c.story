The mother of a five-month-old boy whose life was saved when his aunt performed CPR on the side of a highway revealed today that she is pregnant.

Paolo Vargas learned that she is three months along at the weekend after having her son Sebastian last year. She said on Monday: 'Sebastian will be a big brother.'

Ms Vargas suffered a shock last week when Sebastian stopped breathing while being driven by her sister Pamela Rauseo.

Ms Rauseo was taking five-month-old Sebastian home from a hospital appointment on Thursday when she realized that something was desperately wrong with her nephew who has suffered respiratory problems since being born prematurely.

Ms Rauseo said today: 'We were in the 
car, I was driving and when he stopped crying, I really had a strong 
feeling that something was off.'

'He was sleeping but he looked pale and when I touched him - his body, his hands - I got so nervous I couldn't dial 911.

'I got out of the car and I started screaming for help...Then I got down on my knees and started performing CPR on him and luckily after a while he responded.'

Other drivers, along with a police officer and two firefighters who were also stuck in traffic, rushed to help.

Fellow driver, Miami Herald photographer Al Diaz, snapped a picture of the roadside emergency.

After seeing the dramatic photo of herself bent over and resuscitating her nephew, Ms Rauseo said: 'The images showed me how terrifying it really seemed.'

Other drivers called paramedics who were able to fight their way through the standstill traffic to reach the aunt and nephew, before transferring them to University of Miami hospital.

Ms Rauseo appeared with Sebastian's mother Paola Vargas on GMA on Monday where Ms Vargas spoke of her gratitude towards her sister.

Struggling to contain her tears, Ms Vargas, a nurse, said: 'I get emotional just thinking about it. He was purple.'

Ms Vargas said that her sister and Sebastian have always shared a special bond after Ms Rauseo designed her new nephew's nursery.

The new mother said that Sebastian is currently undergoing tests at University of Miami Hospital and that the family should find out more about his respiratory problems today.

Speaking on MailOnline last week, Ms Rauseo said: 'I was driving along the 836 Dolphin Expressway and he was crying. He's always crying. Even when the car is moving, he's constantly crying.'

Ms Rauseo works as an interior designer and runs Round321, a company dedicated to designing innovative and unique pieces for parents and children.

Her company crafted Sebastianâ€™s nursery and she regularly babysits Sebastian when his mother is at work.

When Sebastian stopped crying and fell quiet in the back of the car, his aunt Pamela Rauseo knew something was wrong
