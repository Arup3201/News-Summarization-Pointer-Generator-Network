A report out Monday claims that former White House press secretary Jay Carney could soon make the jump from Washington, D.C. to Silicon Valley.

According to Re/Code, 49-year-old Carney's name is being thrown around for top PR jobs at both Apple and taxi app Uber.

Carney would reportedly replace Apple's vice president of worldwide corporate communications Katie Cotton. At Uber, rumor has it he'd be the startup's hired gun against the powerful taxicab industry.

Carney, meanwhile, is keeping mum on what his next move will be.

'I'm talking to a lot of people about a variety of possibilities. But I'm not commenting on specifics,' he told Politico.

According to Re/Code's Kara Swisher:

'[Uber CEO Travis] Kalanick is still looking, having talked to other political players such as former Obama White House press secretary Jay Carney (whose name is also being bandied about for the other big job opening in tech PR, at Apple).'

As for Apple, not everyone is convinced Carney's name is even being mentioned. Jim Dalrymple, Apple blogger for The Loop, says 'Tim Cook has never even met Jay Carney.'

Nonetheless, a Washington veteran going pro in the tech world would not be an extraordinary event.

The man Carney replaced, Robert Gibbs, stepped down and then founded his own communications startup, notes Valleywag.

And Uber just this spring poached New York City's former top taxi official Ashwini Chhabra.
