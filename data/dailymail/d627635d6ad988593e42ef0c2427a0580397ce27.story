Airlines should be forced to warn passengers when someone with a nut allergy is on board, the government will be urged today.

Ministers are facing calls to introduce mandatory pre-flight announcements about allergies of passengers alongside warnings about wearing seatbelts and emergency exits.

Campaigners believe most passengers would be willing to avoid eating nuts and other food which could trigger an allergic reaction, but do not know unless airline staff tell them.

Fears about the impact of passengers eating nuts mid-flight have been raised after a number of cases in which young children have gone into anaphylactic shock.

Some airlines will make an announcement to passengers but it can vary between carriers, and even depending on flight attendants.

DUP MP Ian Paisley will us a Commons debate tonight to call for the government to act to force airlines to issue standardised warnings on all domestic flights and those arriving and leaving Britain.

It follows a campaign by his constituent Helena Erwin, whose daughter Emily has a severe nut allergy.

She wants allergy warnings to be a legal requirement, and has called on the Civil Aviation Authority to act.

Mr Paisley told MailOnline: 'About one in 50 people have some sort of allergy. On that basis, we need to get some consistency in the way announcements are made.

'If you are going on a flight, if you are a parent on a flight with a child with an allergy, I want those announcements to be made.

'There should be standard message in the same way as seatbelts and safety.

'I have never heard of a case where someone has eaten nuts in front of people who have an allergy, unless you are a particularly repulsive person.

'Nuts appear to be the big problem the only way you can avoid it is to get away from the environment, but on a plane you cannot do that.'

Last month schoolboy Daniel Levitan was barred from boarding a U.S. plane after his mother Judith asked for a tannoy announcement advising fellow fliers not to eat nuts

He will use a debate in the Commons tonight to challenge aviation minister Robert Goodwill to instruct airlines to respond to passenger requests for a warning message to be player.

Speaking ahead of the debate, Mr Goodwill said: 'Allergies can pose a serious risk and the health and the safety of passengers is our first priority. But we need to ensure any new regulation is proportionate and genuinely reduces the risk posed to travellers.

'If further action is needed, we would push for this to happen at an international level.'

Last month schoolboy Daniel Levitan was barred from boarding a U.S. plane after his parents asked for a tannoy announcement advising fellow fliers not to eat nuts. 

An American Airlines staff member refused to make the announcement, despite a pilot being willing to do so, according to his mother Judith, from St Albans, Hertfordshire.

The family's flights were cancelled and they had to stay another two nights in Florida and spend £200 on phone calls rearranging flights for two days later.

Staff agreed to make a warning announcement when IT consultant Howard, 46, dental practice employee Judith, 41, Daniel and his brother Joel flew out from Heathrow to Fort Myers via Dallas on Boxing Day.

However, Mrs Levitan said she was 'warned' by an AA cabin crew member on the outbound journey: 'Americans have the right to eat nuts'.

In August four-year-old Fae Platten suffered a life-threatening allergy attack at 30,000ft after an airline passenger ignored repeated warnings not to eat peanuts. 

'She had to be revived with an anti-allergy adrenaline injection and was taken to hospital for treatment after the Ryanair plane landed at Stansted.

Life-threatening: Four-year-old Fae Platten went into anaphylactic shock on a Ryanair flight

Airlines are more aware than ever of the danger of nut allergies - and for good reason. 

Last August four-year-old Fae Platten went into anaphylactic shock on board a Ryanair budget flight from Tenerife to London after a fellow passenger opened a bag of nuts against official advice.

It was a rare event. According to the website Allergy UK, no one is ever known to have died of a peanut allergy on a plane and symptoms are usually restricting to streaming eyes and wheezing.

However, the website adds: 'Once the packets are opened, the peanut dust erupts into the air and is circulated around the aircraft cabin.

'Not every person with peanut allergy reports having a problem, but when it does occur, it can be extremely distressing.'

Due to concerns over allergies, many airlines have long since stopped serving packets of peanuts on board. These include United, easyJet, British Airways and even American Airlines.

They cannot prevent individual passengers from bringing their own packets of peanuts on board, although they can make announcements advising passengers not to.

The Allergy UK website adds: 'If you plan to negotiate the removal of nut snacks on your flight, take a non-confrontational stance. Use a softly softly approach.

'Try not to worry the airline so much they refuse to carry you or your party. Make it clear that you have a problem and need help.'
