In a bid to help potential recruits get a real feel for life as an Army Reservist, the Ministry of Defence is turning to virtual reality.

During a series of events in London and Manchester today, the recruits will be fitted with Oculus Rift headsets and dropped into virtual training exercises. 

One will reveal what it's like to take part in a live fire exercise on Salisbury Plain, while another will let wearers take part in a mission in a Challenger 2 tank. 

During a series of events in London and Manchester, Army Reservist recruits will be fitted with Oculus Rift headsets (picutred) and dropped into virtual training exercises. One will reveal what it's like to take part in a live fire exercise, while another will let wearers take part in a mission in a Challenger 2 tank

The events are taking place at Waterloo station in London and at Manchester's Piccadilly Gardens.

The experiences were created by London-based Visualise, and begin when the user takes a seat in a Range Rover.

The Rift headset is made by Oculus, a virtual reality firm which initially received funding for the device through Kickstarter.

The Norwegian Army is trialling a system that uses the Oculus Rift to drive armoured vehicles without soldiers having to stick their heads above the hatch.

Cameras mounted around the vehicle film its surroundings and this footage is fed to the driver through the headset, creating the illusion that the tank is ‘transparent.’

When a driver looks left, they see footage from the left camera, and vice versa on the right - achieving a 360-degree view of the road.

By lowering their gaze and looking down towards the vehicle belts, the driver can also use the system to parallel park 'with a precision of up to a centimetre', without the assistance of the vehicle commander. 

It also removes the blind spots that occur when driving large vehicles. 

It raised more than $2 million dollars (£1.3 million) in 2012, and last year Oculus was bought by Facebook for $2 billion (£1.3 billion).

Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg said at the time of the acquisition: 'Oculus [is] the clear leader in something that has the potential to be the next important, or one of the next most important, computing platforms.'

The headset is yet to go on consumer sale, although it is available online as a development kit for around £230 ($350).

The first Army experience that uses the headset will drop the wearer into a live fire exercise with virtual members of the Army Reserve at the Ministry's Salisbury Plain Training Area.

As a crewman in a Challenger 2 tank, in the second experience, the wearer will be surrounded by other tanks engaging enemy positions using laser sights. 

They will also be able to communicate with other soldiers in armoured vehicles driving alongside. 

The Army said it will add further experiences in the future.

The Army's new recruitment campaign, which involves a new TV advert that will be on show at the drive, comes as new research reveals one in four people said they felt challenge and excitement was missing from their job.

According to the Army, a One Poll survey revealed that around seven in 10 people would consider volunteering or a part-time job alongside their normal work.

And one in four said they would consider joining the Army Reserves to 'find that challenge and excitement'.

The MoD offers a '100% Army Fit' app (pictured) to help recruits build their fitness to the level of a soldier in training

Major General Chris Tickell, director-general of the Army recruiting and training division, said: 'This research tells us that people feel their day jobs are lacking challenge, excitement and the opportunity to travel - all of which are available at a world-class standard with the Army Reserve.

'By using the virtual headsets, people will be able to step straight into an exciting real-world scenario of volunteering with the Army Reserve and the huge variety of challenging roles there are to choose from.

'Introducing virtual reality technology is just one of the ways that the Army is transforming the way it recruits. 

The Army recently introduced a simplified, online application form for mobile, tablet or desktop to help people sign up. 

It also offers a '100%  Army Fit' app that helps new recruits build their fitness to the level of a soldier in training,  and new mobile recruitment offices.

Henry Stuart, the managing director of Visualise, added: 'This is the first time virtual reality has ever been used for recruitment purposes and to me, the Army are the perfect client to achieve this world-first with, as an organisation that has always mixed tradition with cutting-edge technology.

'As virtual reality becomes ever-more mainstream, the applications of it widen. 

From launching cars for Mercedes by allowing you to sit alongside Lewis Hamilton as he tears around a racetrack, to allowing members of the public to become instant virtual holidaymakers with Thomas Cook, we are seeing brands around the world over sit up and take notice of the possibilities.'
