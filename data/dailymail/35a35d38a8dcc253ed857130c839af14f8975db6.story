U.S. President Barack Obama
said on Monday that Iran should commit to a verifiable freeze of
at least 10 years on its nuclear activity for a landmark atomic
deal to be reached, but said the odds were still against sealing
a final agreement.

In an interview with Reuters at the White House, Obama said
that a rift over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
planned speech to Congress opposing the Iran deal on Tuesday was
a distraction that would not be 'permanently destructive' to
U.S. Israeli ties.

But he said there was a 'substantial disagreement' between
his administration and the Israeli government over how to
achieve their shared goal of preventing Iran from acquiring
nuclear weapons.

Earlier on Monday in a speech on Monday to the American Israel Public AffairsCommittee (AIPAC) Netanyahu warned that a nuclear deal could threaten Israel's survival

'If, in fact, Iran is willing to agree to double-digit years
of keeping their program where it is right now and, in fact,
rolling back elements of it that currently exist ... if we've
got that, and we've got a way of verifying that, there's no
other steps we can take that would give us such assurance that
they don't have a nuclear weapon,' he said.

The U.S. goal is to make sure 'there's at least a year
between us seeing them try to get a nuclear weapon and them
actually being able to obtain one,' Obama said.

Israel fears that Obama's Iran diplomacy, with an
end-of-March deadline for a framework nuclear agreement, will
still allow its arch-foe to develop an atom bomb. Tehran denies
it is seeking nuclear weapons.

Netanyahu has spoken scathingly about a possible deal,
saying negotiators appear to have given up on a pledge to
prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. He says a
nuclear-armed Iran would pose an existential threat to the
Jewish state.

Obama sought to downplay the long-term damage from the row
over Netanyahu's speech to Congress, saying the rift was not
personal and that he would meet the Israeli leader again if he
wins Israel's March 17 election.

'This is not a personal issue. I think that it is important
for every country in its relationship with the United States to
recognize that the U.S. has a process of making policy,' Obama
said.

But Obama said Netanyahu had been wrong before with his
opposition to a 2013 interim deal with Iran.

Israel fears that Obama's Iran diplomacy, with an end-of-March deadline for a framework nuclear agreement, will still allow its arch-foe to develop an atom bomb

'Netanyahu made all sorts of claims. This was going to be a
terrible deal. This was going to result in Iran getting 50
billion dollars worth of relief. Iran would not abide by the
agreement. None of that has come true.

'It has turned out that in fact, during this period we've
seen Iran not advance its program. In many ways, it's rolled
back elements of its program.'

The White House last week denied a report that the United
States and Iran were exploring a possible 10-year deal that
would initially freeze Iran's nuclear program but gradually
allow it to increase activities that could enable it to produce
nuclear arms in the last years of the agreement.

In a speech on Monday to the American Israel Public Affairs
Committee (AIPAC), the largest U.S. pro-Israel lobby, Netanyahu
again warned that a nuclear deal could threaten Israel's
survival while insisting the U.S.-Israeli relationship was
'stronger than ever.'

Asked about the prospects for a final deal with Iran, which
has a June 30 deadline, Obama said that a key doubt was whether
Iran would agree to rigorous inspection demands and the low
levels of uranium enrichment capability they would have to
maintain.

'But if they do agree to it, it would be far more effective
in controlling their nuclear program than any military action we
could take, any military action Israel could take and far more
effective than sanctions will be,' Obama said.

A comprehensive nuclear deal is seen as crucial to reducing
the risk of a wider Middle East war, at a time when Iran is
deeply involved in conflicts in Syria and Iraq.
