The BBC should be split in two because it is has become too big to manage effectively, the head of Comic Relief has warned.

The Chair of the charity Peter Bennett-Jones, who has worked with the corporation for 15 years on Red Nose Day, says that the sheer scale of the BBC has made it too large to manage properly.

Mr Bennett-Jones, who is stepping down after 15 years as the Comic Relief Chair of Trustees, told The Times that the broadcaster should be split into two - with one organisation focusing on entertainment and another on news, similar to ITV.

The BBC employs around 16,500 people - 437 of which are senior managers

He said: 'There's such tension between news, news management, and news compliance and a completely different set of rules that should apply to drama, entertainment and comedy,' The Times reported.

'The people running the BBC are from the new and factual side, but I'm more interested in the showbiz side, and by large so are most of the audience.'

The BBC currently employs around 16,500 people, according to figures released for 2012/ 2013.

Of these, 437 people are classed as senior management, with salaries ranging from 'under £70,000' a year to 'between £370,000 to £399,999'.

The BBC refused to respond to the comments.

Recently the corporation's management as come under intense scrutiny from Parliament, after MPs grilled them about who signed off huge pay-outs to senior managers last week.

The Public Accounts Committee questioning exposed a bitter BBC civil war as Mark Thompson, Lord Patten and other serving and former executives sought to shift the blame over who knew about over-generous pay-offs to managers.

During almost three hours of furious questioning in Parliament, former Director-General Mr Thompson and BBC Trust Lord Patten repeatedly contradicted each other, notably over a £1million settlement for ex-deputy Director-General Mark Byford.

Mr Thompson insisted he told the BBC Trust about the details of the pay-offs.

But sitting just feet away, BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten hit back, saying he was repeatedly told the huge deal for Mr Byford was 'contractual' and 'standard'.

Cheers rang out in the BBC newsroom as the corporation's personnel chief Lucy Adams was branded a liar by committee chairwoman Margaret Hodge, who is investigating the staggering pay offs.

Mr Bennett-Jones comments on management follow the revelation that the a number of senior BBC executives on six-figure salaries are juggling extra business interests.

Now a powerful Commons committee is to probe the 'second jobs  culture' at the top of the BBC after The Mail on Sunday uncovered how senior executives are running thriving businesses on the side.

One manager, earning £207,000 a year, has found the time to establish a cafe business.

Another £175,000-a-year director also runs a consumer electronic business, while the £131,000-year-head of the director-general’s office works as a director of the London Ambulance Service.

John Whittingdale, Tory chairman of the Culture, Media and Sport select committee, said he was planning to grill BBC Chairman Chris Patten and Director-General Tony Hall over the issue when they appear before MPs next month.

He also said that he was going to launch a ‘substantial’ inquiry into the BBC to look at ‘root and branch reforms’, including whether the licence fee should be scrapped.

Mr Whittingdale’s move comes against the backdrop of growing outrage over high pay and extravagant pay-offs at the Corporation, and an increasingly toxic relationship between the Government and the BBC.

Mr Bennett-Jones will be handing over the reins in September this year to newly appointed Chair Designate, Tim Davie, Chief Executive of BBC Worldwide and Director, Global.

His comments follow a difficult year for the the corporation, which has been plagued with scandal and in-fighting.
