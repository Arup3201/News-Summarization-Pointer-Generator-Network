A five-organ transplant patient has miraculously given birth to a healthy baby, making her the first reported case in the world.

The new mother, Fatema Al Ansari, gave birth to a girl, Alkadi Alhayal, two weeks ago in Miami and has been looked over by hospital staff.

Six years ago, Al Ansari, then 19, was living in Qatar and was diagnosed with a blood clot to a major vein to the intestine, causing extreme organ failure.

The woman had always wanted a family, and the news of her condition came as a crushing blow.

Al Ansari who was two months pregnant at the time, was forced to terminate the fetus in order to save her life because of her mesenteric thrombosis. 

Also in 2007, she received a life-saving organ transplant surgery at Jackson Memorial hospital in Miami, and was given a new stomach, large and small intestine, pancreas, and liver.

Though it was high-risk, she then decided she still wanted to pursue having a family. She knew going into it that a pregnancy could cause an adverse reaction to her transplanted organs.

Her OB-GYN, Dr Salih Yasin, told CBS Miami that she helped Al Ansari get pregnant through in-vitro fertilisation. ‘That she is healthy enough to consider having babies is a miracle by itself,’ he said.

Though Al Ansari faced some complications during pregnancy, doctors say that she will be able to have more children.

Al Ansari, now 26, said at a news conference: ‘She is a gift from God and a miracle,’ according to CBS Miami. She will remain in the Florida city for another week for doctors to monitor her and her baby.

Then, she and her husband and new baby will head back to their home in Qatar. 

‘It’s the best feeling in the world to be a mother,’ she said at a news conference today.

Doctors at the hospital said there is no other reported case of a five-organ transplant patient giving birth in the world.
