An overweight blogger has documented her amazing body transformation after dropping four stone - in just 100 days. 

Sophie King, 26, gave up on sport and fitness after suffering a series of illnesses and watched her weight balloon to 14 stone.

But the primary school teacher created a unique plan to guarantee that she slimmed down in exactly 100 days.

Sophie, from Newquay, Cornwall, shunned supplements and diet pills and decided to stick with a healthy balanced meals combined with daily exercise.

Sophie put on several stone (left) after several illnesses, including a broken ankle, an abscess and glandular fever. But after 100 days she slimmed down dramatically to a size 10 (right.) 

But more than three months, she also meticulously charted her journey on her blog, posting photos of her meals and activities while attracting an incredible 10,000 followers.

And at the end of her '100 Healthy Days' challenge - her version of the '100 Happy Days' internet craze - she stripped off to reveal her bikini body and amazing four stone weight loss.

Sophie was a healthy body shape when she lived in Cheshire in her teens but gave up sports after breaking her ankle when she was 17.

She went on to graduate from Durham University but suffered a bout of glandular fever and was later in and out of hospital battling a painful leg abscess for nine months.

At her heaviest she weighed 14 stone. 

Sophie said: 'I broke my ankle at 17 and had pins put in it. I used to play sport but after that I couldn't and that was the start of me putting on weight.

Sophie King documented the healthy meals she was eating on her blog for 100 days during her weight loss 

'When I got to university I was really unhealthy and ended up with glandular fever. 

'Then nine months of hell with the abscess was a bit of a wake up call.

'I moved to Cornwall because I wanted to be somewhere I can enjoy the outdoors and to be fitter and healthier.

'I have been much more conscious of my health and this challenge has been a way to share it with other people.

Sophie also posted snaps of her daily exercise in the Cornish countryside 

'Over the past 100 days so much has changed, it might not sounds like a long time but there is so much you can do in 100 days.

'I feel fitter, healthier and so much more confident.'

Despite finishing her 100 Healthy Days challenge, Sophie has decided keep up with her blog because of the requests and messages she gets from her thousands of followers.

She has also begun using her new-found love of fitness to raise funds for the RNLI by taking part in the Big Swim Cornwall and Castle2Castle swim.

Sophie added: 'The blog was all about sharing everything about diet and fitness, so the next step is going to be more along the lines of well-being, healthy mind and healthy spirit.

Sophie King managed to lose four stone in 100 days, going from 14 stone (left) to 10 stone (right) 

'I've had so many people say that they don't want me to stop, so I don't feel like I should stop. I've had so much lovely feedback.

'There is the danger with exercise that it can become addictive, so the blog will be about how to balance exercise with a happy life.

'When I moved to Cornwall, swimming in the sea was a particular fear of mine, but setting challenges has helped me overcome that and I now swim in the sea regularly.

'I haven't run in 10 years and I went on a treadmill to see what would happen and managed to do 10k no problem.

'So now I'm attempting a triathlon - a whole new world has opened up in front of me.

'It's all about taking a small step every day - at the end of 100 days it adds up to a whole new you.'
