A Brisbane woman has lost a court case after she accused her Catholic Church employer of sex discrimination when the organisation fired her for being involved in an online polyamorous community.

Susan Bunning was hired by Centacare in 2007 and worked for the company until August 2013 when the Catholic social services organisation terminated her employment after discovering her contact details listed on the Brisbane Poly Group website. 

A group calling themselves 'Brisbane Poly People' describes the community as a 'social and discussion group based in Brisbane for all who are interested in open relationships, polyamory, and the varied alternatives to monogamy'. 

Susan Bunning was fired from Catholic organisation Centacare after the company discovered her details on a polyamorous website

The Federal Circuit Court judgement showed that Ms Bunning had been accused by Centacare of gross misconduct, breaching the company's code of conduct and bringing the it into disrepute.

Ms Bunning was informed that her lifestyle contradicted the morals of the Catholic Church, and was given five weeks salary after she was listed online as a member of the Poly Group.

Her details had been listed on the site as a 'poly-friendly counselor' between 2011 and 2012 following a request from one of the group members, which was pointed out to her during a meeting in August 2013 with two managers of Centacare.

She was confronted by her colleagues with a printed out list of the members, and was questioned whether her involvement was for professional or personal reasons. 

Ms Bunning claimed that she had been discriminated against as because of her sex, and originally made several submissions to the Australian Human Rights Commission, who dismissed her allegations as 'misconceived'.

Justice Vasta concluded that her 'behaviour' differed from 'sexual orientation'

Ms Bunning worked for Centacare 2007 and worked for the company until August 2013

After her complaint to the AHRC was denied, she then took her case to the Federal Circuit Court, where Judge Salvator Vasta handed down his judgement on February 11, and dismissed the appeal on the basis that it had no 'reasonable prospect of success'.

Ms Bunning told the court that she had been dismissed because 'of the characteristics that appertain generally to persons who are polyamorous', after she was accused of seven counts of gross misconduct.

Justice Vasta concluded that her 'behaviour' differed from 'sexual orientation', and stated that being polyamorous was rather a 'manifestation' of her orientation.

'Sexual orientation is how one is, rather than how one manifests that state of being. The manifestation of that state of being can take many forms,' Justice Vasta said. 

'If the contention of the applicant were correct, many people whose sexual activity might label them as sado-masochists, coprophiliacs or urophiliacs could claim that such is more than mere behaviour; it is in fact their very sexual orientation,' Justice Vasta said.

Figures for the US indicate that almost half a million people identify as polyamorous

Justice Vasta said that the result would be of 'absurdity' if the court accepted polyamory as sexual orientation, and could lead people to campaign for the protection of paedophilia and necrophilia under the Sex Discrimination Act of 1984.

He ruled that despite finding his ruling 'unpalatable', Ms Bunning should be allowed to 'ventilate her grievance', 'no matter what the merits or the probability of success' on her claim.

There are currently no figures on the number of people in Australia who consider themselves polyamorous, reported The Sydney Morning Herald. 

However, figures for the US indicate that almost half a million people identify as polyamorous, a behaviour which has been defined as 'ethical non-monogamy', 

The Brisbane Poly People and Centacare have been contacted for comment.
