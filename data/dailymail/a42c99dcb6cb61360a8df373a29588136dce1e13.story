Former Manchester City boss Roberto Mancini appears to be under pressure after failing to improve Inter Milan's fortunes since taking up at the reins at the San Siro.

Mancini looks a distressed figure on the front cover of Monday's La Gazzetta dello Sport after seeing his side fail to claim all three points against Serie A relegation candidates Cesena.

The 50-year-old conceded after his side's 1-1 draw with Cesena that his side were going to struggle to qualify for next season's Champions League.

Mancini could hardly watch as his side fought to save face against relegation battlers Cesena 

Inter  must finish third or win the Europa League if they are to qualify for next season's Champions League

Inter either have to close the nine-point gap on third-placed Lazio or turnaround their two-legged encounter against Wolfsburg, which they lost 3-1 in Germany, before going on to win the Europa League.

Mancini told Sky Sport Italia after Sunday's encounter against Cesena:'With a win we would've climbed to 39 points with 11 rounds to go.

'Now it's going to be pretty difficult to reach third place.

'With a victory we could've had hope, but there are too many teams in front of us now.

'At the moment there's no point talking about third place and it's not even logical to do so.'
