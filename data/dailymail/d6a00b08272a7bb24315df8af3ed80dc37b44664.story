Acting dynasty: Star of Dambusters and 1984 Sir Michael Redgrave, and daughter Vanessa

MI5 kept a file on Sir Michael Redgrave – the star of Dambusters and 1984 – for 20 years on suspicion he was a Communist.

The internationally-acclaimed British actor also came to the attention of Special Branch 21 times between 1940 and 1949 and sparked great excitement among security officials when meeting notorious traitor Guy Burgess in Moscow.

Burgess, secret files reveal today, got drunk and was sick in Sir Michael’s dressing room during a production of a Shakespeare play.

Sir Michael – the father of actors Vanessa, Corin and Lynn – first came to the Security Service’s attention in 1940 when he signed the manifesto of the Communist-inspired People’s Vigilance Committee.

Sir Michael and his wife, Rachel Kempson, were both involved in the Unity Theatre Communist Group and by 1944 he was a leading member of the Actors Group of the Communist Party.

The declassified documents reveal how a Mr Jardine Brown, from the BBC, wrote to MI5 asking for advice on whether it was safe to use Sir Michael for broadcasting.

MI5 said that while the actor had ‘made a fool of himself’, it had no objection to his continued employment.

Sir Michael went on to make Dambusters, where he played Barnes Wallis, the inventor of the bouncing bomb.

The most illuminating section of his file – which runs to more than 100 pages – details a trip to Moscow in 1958/59 for a production of Hamlet.

There he met Burgess, one of the Cambridge Five spy ring who had fled Britain seven years earlier with Soviet double agent Donald Maclean after passing Western intelligence to the Russians.

It did not get off to a good start, with the louche, flamboyantly homosexual Burgess turning up drunk at the theatre.

British ambassador Sir Patrick Reilly 
reported to MI5: ‘After one of the performances Burgess made his way to 
Redgrave’s dressing room and there was sick.’

Nevertheless,
 Sir Michael agreed to visit Burgess for lunch in his flat – which had 
been provided by the KGB following his defection – much to Sir Patrick’s
 chagrin. Burgess, writing to his mother in London – in a letter 
intercepted by MI5 – said the pair had had ‘fine gossips’.

And he gushed about Sir Michael’s acting, writing: ‘I have never seen such a reception as Michael’s Hamlet got on its last night. It’s certainly the best  Hamlet I’ve ever seen.’

MI5, keen to find out more about Burgess’s life in Moscow, used an old friend of Sir Michael to find out what was discussed by the pair.

Much of what Burgess was said to have told the actor they already knew, but MI5’s source was intrigued by one remark by Burgess that ‘I did all that was required of me by bringing Maclean safe to Russia’.

Sir Michael later confirmed Burgess had not wanted to defect – believing his own role was simply to get Maclean safely out of the country – and that he had been duped by his KGB handlers.

The National Archives files reveal that other actors, musicians and literary figures were investigated by MI5 as possible Communists in the post-war years.

They included J B Priestley, Benjamin Britten and his lover Peter Pears. All were considered to have Left-wing sympathies but were not rated threats to national security.
