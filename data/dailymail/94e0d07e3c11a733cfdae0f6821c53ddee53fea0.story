David Haye may not have taken to the ring in two-and-a-half years, but the 34-year-old Londoner is still looking fighting fit.

The former heavyweight champion posted a picture on his Instagram of himself topless - showing his muscular body in perfect physical condition - while wearing shades.

He accompanied the photo with the message: 'Looking and feeling healthy thanks to the amazing food from @KX_life.'

Haye (right) last featured in the ring when he beat Dereck Chisora - two-and-a-half years ago

'The Hayemaker' was last seen in the ring when he beat fellow Brit Dereck Chisora in July 2012. 

Officially he has yet to retire, with his career in hiatus, but he split from long-term trainer Adam Booth last year having been forced to withdraw from a bout with Tyson Fury six months previously.

Haye's crowning glory was back in 2009 when he claimed the WBA world heavyweight title from the Russian giant Nikolay Valuev.

In all, Haye has fought on 28 occasions, winning 26 (24 by knockout) and losing twice.
