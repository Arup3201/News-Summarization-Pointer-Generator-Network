There are times when watching England can sap your energy. That much is true, never more so than during the World Cup. And this mundane Euro 2016 qualifying campaign has the makings of a lethargy-inducing trudge.

So thank goodness for Wayne Rooney and his curling free-kick. Eyes were glazing over in Tallinn after 73 minutes of frustration against an Estonia team with 10 men and little ambition. Raheem Sterling was not the only one feeling weary.

Up popped Rooney with an effort which squirted from the grasp of goalkeeper Sergei Pareiko and spilled into the net to win the game and inch the captain a little closer to the England goal record.

His pursuit of Sir Bobby Charlton has taken on a life of its own, since there is not a lot else to excite on the road to France. He now has 43 goals from his 99 appearances, six short of Sir Bobby and five behind Gary Lineker, who was teased by his son on Twitter with 'Rooney's gonna get ya old man'.

Roy Hodgson had been preparing to take Rooney off and replace him with Rickie Lambert when the goal went in. The forms had been filled in and handed to the fourth official, according to ITV, who were pitch-side.

Hodgson later denied this, which was odd, and talked his way into a muddle, as he is prone to do, claiming his backroom staff might have been doing that, but he wanted to keep his captain on. How strange.

Anyhow, when Lambert eventually entered the fray, it was in place of Danny Welbeck, who 'rolled an ankle' according to the manager. It is not thought to be serious but Arsene Wenger, with injuries piling up at Arsenal, will be anxious to check.

Rooney had misfired against San Marino on Thursday – squandering a hatful of chances and scoring from a penalty - and was the chief culprit as more chances came and went in Tallinn.

It seemed set to be a tale of dreadful finishing by the Gulf of Finland, despite playing against 10 men for nearly half the game. Estonia lost their captain Ragnar Klavan - also winning his 99th cap - sent off for a second yellow card when he body-checked Fabian Delph, early in the second half.

Rooney, however, refused to be deterred. He has now scored 11 in 26 games since Hodgson took over from Fabio Capello and this one gave England maximum points from three games in Group E.

They are on the way to the manager's artificial target to win all 10 qualifiers and were able to celebrate another clean sheet. Luis Suarez was the last player to score against them.

England will have seen out his ban without conceding a goal, although they were almost caught out in the opening seconds with a shot by Blackpool's Sergei Zenjov, which clipped Gary Cahill on the heels and fizzed narrowly wide.

The move started with a clear foul on Fabian Delph in midfield missed by the Croatian referee Marijo Strahonja, who was very lenient with some feisty tackling by the home team, early on.

Jack Wilshere took an arm in the face, lost his boot in another late tackle and Jordan Henderson was wiped out by Martin Vunk, who somehow escaped a yellow card. Cahill clattered through Zenjov after winning the ball, as if to warn the Estonians they could have that sort of game if that's what they wanted.

When the yellow card finally came out it was to book Klavan for holding back Welbeck and it proved costly when he was dismissed three minutes after the interval.

England's best effort in the first-half came from Rooney, who made an angled run, was found by Wilshere and took on the volley, dropping over his right shoulder. It was difficult but Rooney caught it sweetly, possibly too sweetly, and it flashed over.

On other occasions, he appeared less confident and uncertain in front of goal, making the runs and getting the chances but failing to test the goalkeeper. He missed one cross from Leighton Baines at the near-post and headed another wide.

He darted clear again before the break, but was unable to fashion an effort on goal as the blue shirts recovered to crowd him out. It was beginning to feel like an extension of his frustrating night against San Marino, when he had many chances but scored only once, from the penalty spot.

Wilshere, excellent in the holding role without having to do much holding against a team who rarely had the ball, smashed one into the side-netting and Henderson forced the first save of the game from Pareiko with a dipping shot from 30 yards, just before half-time.

Hodgson deserves a little credit for taking the necessary risk to clinch the win, sending on Sterling and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to inject pace and impetus.

Sterling had not started having complained of being tired on the eve of the game. Adam Lallana was selected instead and was bright and busy early on, but his clubmate came on won the free-kick on the edge of the penalty box which Rooney finally converted.

At last there was reward for a game England dominated almost as completely as the one against San Marino. Rooney ought to have made it two. He was clean through again before the end but could not beat Pareiko.

He is going after the record in ones. But last night one was enough to wake England up.
