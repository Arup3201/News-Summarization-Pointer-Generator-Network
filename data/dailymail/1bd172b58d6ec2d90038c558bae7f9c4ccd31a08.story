The vice chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, a trade group promoting the adoption of the digital currency, has been charged by U.S. prosecutors with conspiring to commit money laundering by helping to funnel cash to illicit online drugs bazaar Silk Road.

Charlie Shrem, who had financial backing from the Winklevoss twins and is well known as one of the bitcoin's biggest global promoters, was arrested on Sunday at John. F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan said on Monday.

Shrem, who was also charged with operating an unlicensed money transmitting business, appeared in U.S. District Court in Manhattan on Monday and was released on $1million bond.

‘At this point the allegations in the complaint are simply allegations, and Mr. Shrem is presumed innocent,’ his lawyer Keith Miller said.

The 24-year-old entrepreneur, who lives above a bar he jointly owns in Manhattan that accepts bitcoins as payment, was CEO of BitInstant, a bitcoin exchange company that closed last summer.

According to prosecutors, Shrem conspired with a Florida resident, Robert Faiella, who ran an illegal exchange, to sell more than $1million in bitcoins to users of Silk Road, which was shuttered by authorities last year.

Faiella, 52, is also charged in the complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan with conspiring to commit money laundering and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. He was arrested at his home in Coral Gables, Florida. At his court hearing on Monday in federal court in Florida, Faiella consented to detention until Wednesday, at which point there will be a bail hearing.

Shrem could not be reached for comment. A person who answered the phone at Faiella's house and declined to be identified said, ‘Nobody wants to talk.’

Bitcoin is a digital currency that is not backed by a government or central bank and whose value fluctuates according to demand by users. Users can transfer bitcoins to each other over the Internet and store the currency in digital ‘wallets.’

Rise of the Bitcoins: Bitcoins were first introduced four years ago and were initially unknown to everyone but hackers and the computer-savvy, but they have now caught the eye of investors

The criminal complaint says that 
Shrem, in addition to knowing that Faiella's business was funneling 
money into Silk Road, also used Silk Road himself to buy drugs, 
including marijuana-infused brownies.

‘When
 Bitcoins, like any traditional currency, are laundered and used to fuel
 criminal activity, law enforcement has no choice but to act,’ Preet 
Bharara, the U.S. attorney for Manhattan, said in a statement emailed to
 the press on Monday. ‘We will aggressively pursue those who would 
co-opt new forms of currency for illicit purposes.’

Bharara
 has said recently that prosecutors are not going after Bitcoin itself 
and view it as they view any other currency in which transactions are 
sometimes made illegally.

U.S.
 law enforcement officials have vowed to pursue any criminal activity in
 the nascent Bitcoin world as regulators try to formulate their approach
 to the digital currency.

The
 charging of a prominent Bitcoin Foundation official may be a blow to 
Bitcoin's prospects, though it did not have a huge immediate impact on 
trading. Bitcoins were exchanging hands at $970 late on Monday, down 
from prices above $1,000 earlier this month but up from around $150 four
 months ago on the Tokyo-based exchange MtGox.

Winklevoss
 Capital, which is run by twin brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, 
invested in BitInstant in 2012 and led a capital-raising effort last May
 that raised $1.5million. The twins, who are best known for their failed
 lawsuit against Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in which they had 
claimed he had stolen their idea for an online social networking 
platform at Harvard, have been seeking regulatory approval for a bitcoin
 exchange-traded fund.

‘When
 we invested in BitInstant in the fall of 2012, its management made a 
commitment to us that they would abide by all applicable laws - 
including money laundering laws - and we expected nothing less,’ the 
Winkelvoss twins said in a statement. ‘Although BitInstant is not named 
in today's indictment of Charlie Shrem, we are obviously deeply 
concerned about his arrest,’ they said. ‘We were passive investors in 
BitInstant and will do everything we can to help law enforcement 
officials.’

Double vision: Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, known best for their alleged connection to the founding of Facebook, invested $1.5million in BitInstant last year

As part of the 
conditions of his bail, Shrem will be confined to his parents' home in 
the Marine Park section of Brooklyn. A report prepared by the court for 
his bail hearing listed his net worth at $6million, according to U.S. 
Magistrate Judge Henry Pitman. Serrin Turner, an assistant U.S. 
attorney, opposed bail, saying Shrem had a ‘strong incentive to flee’ 
and the means to do so.

Bitcoin
 insiders said Shrem's arrest showed just how hard it is to get away 
with illegal activity using Bitcoin, which has an ownership chain built 
into its software so that each unit can be tied to the users who have 
acquired or spent it.

‘Using
 bitcoin for illicit transactions is really, really dumb,’ said Patrick 
Murck, the Bitcoin Foundation's general counsel. ‘Bitcoins are so easy 
to track.’

According to the 
charges, Faiella, going by ‘BTCKing’ online, sold bitcoins to Silk Road 
users and passed on purchase orders he received from the site to Shrem, 
who filled them, transferring funds to Faiella's account at an 
unidentified bitcoin exchange service based in Japan.

The
 charging document says that Shrem failed to report suspicious activity 
to regulators ‘with respect to numerous Bitcoin purchases’ Faiella made 
from BitInstant.

The 
document contains email conversations between Shrem and BitInstant's 
co-founder, who is not identified in the charges but is listed on 
BitInstant's website as Gareth Nelson, in which Shrem tried to hide his 
dealings with Faiella by pretending to ban him from BitInstant's 
exchange platform.

‘You are hereby banned from our services,’ he wrote in an email to BTCKing that he copied to Nelson.

According
 to the complaint, Shrem then privately wrote to BTCKing, without 
including Nelson. ‘Your email address is banned,’ Shrem wrote, ‘but you 
can use a different one.’

Bitcoins
 have been gaining wider acceptance recently. The Sacramento Kings 
basketball team earlier this month became the first professional sports 
franchise to say it would allow purchases using bitcoins. Last month, 
ecommerce site Overstock.com announced its plan to become the first 
major U.S. retailer to accept the digital currency.

Created
 in 2009 by a developer or team of developers going by the name Satoshi 
Nakamoto, whose true identity remains unknown, the bitcoin's earliest 
adopters have included people expressing a desire to conduct their 
affairs in a realm outside of government-sanctioned commercial spaces.

Some
 of that sentiment is visible in the charges against Shrem and Faiella. 
In one online interaction, Shrem tried to assure Faiella he was being 
discreet.

‘The art of hiding
 is making people think you are someone else,’ he wrote. Faiella 
replied: ‘You must understand that the people that we pay taxes to have a
 long reach and I like to stay away from that.’
