Under pressure: Current Newcastle manager Alan Pardew is not wanted by a majority of fans

Galtier, 47, has been in charge of St 
Etienne since 2009 and had a spell as Alain Perrin's assistant manager at Portsmouth in 2005.

Newcastle manager Alan Pardew has come under increasing pressure from the club's supporters of late.

He
 was given a three-match stadium ban and was suspended for a further 
four games for headbutting Hull midfielder David Meyler in March.

Newcastle lost six of those seven matches and fans' protests against owner Mike Ashley and Pardew continue to grow.

It's a sign: Newcastle fans let their feelings be known at the Emirates last month
