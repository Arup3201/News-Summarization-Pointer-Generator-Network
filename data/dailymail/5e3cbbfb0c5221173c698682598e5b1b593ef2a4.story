New mother: Caroline Berg Eriksen, pictured with her baby daughter this week, has provoked outrage among the blogging community with the post

The blogger gave birth to her daughter Neilia on Monday morning.

Posting on Instagram, she said: 'I
 gave birth to the most beautiful baby girl yesterday, 10 minutes past 9
 in the morning Her name is Nelia and she is perfect.'

Mrs Berg Eriksen, who is married to Premier League player Lars-Kristian Eriksen has sparked outrage in the Norwegian media with the post - with one blogger slamming the move as 'wildly provocative.' 

Writing online, writer Suzanne Aabel said she couldn't be sure if Mrs Ber Eriksen even 'belonged to the same species'.

She said: 'In my eyes, 
this picture is wildly provocative.

'Not just because I'm 
the chubby girl who's envious of her petite figure, but because I began 
to despise my own body when I was about twelve.'

Commenting on the post, one writer Heidi said: 'Is it really necessary to post a halvnakent picture of themselves?! It's just to show off, thinking's not much on how that image can affect readers.'

Commenting on the photo on Instagram, one user laurajanewilkes said, 'Can she look like this 4 days after???'

Pregnancy: The blogger, who is married to footballer Lars-Kristian Eriksen, is well known in Norway as a health and fitness writer

Mrs Berg Eriksen replied to her

 myself and my body for something as tough as a pregnancy / birth, and I
 think all mothers, regardless of the body shall be.'

The blogger was also backed by Gro Nylander, head of the women's clinic at the Norwegian National Hospital.

According to the Local, she said: 'I don't think we should bully The Footballer's Wife. 'Life is unfair, some people have flat stomachs while others have pouts.'

The doctor added that new mothers  must understand that every body responded differently to pregnancy and that is was not productive to compare to other women.

'The most imporant thing is to be kind to your body. It's a positive thing to have a few extra kilos on your body after birth,' she said.

Mrs Berg Eriksen studied journalism at the Norwegian School of Creative Studies before becoming a fitness and health blogger.

She lives in rural Norway with husband Lars-Kristian Eriksen and Hugo her chihuahua.

Lars-Kristian Eriksen plays for Odd Grenland in the Norwegian Premier League.

He has played 19 games for Norway under 21s national football team.
