A terminally-ill young mother who had
a dream wedding with a male model as her groom has completed another 
dying wish - having a hen do.

Kayleigh Duff, 23, was diagnosed with bowel cancer in June 2012 and medics removed her bowel.

In March, she started 
chemotherapy and drew up a list of things she would have wanted
to do in her life – including getting married.

Last week she was given a 
perfect wedding day by her best friend last week, complete with bubbly, cake, a 
chauffeur driven Jaguar and stand-in groom.

Kayleigh Duff, who has terminal liver cancer, was given a perfect wedding day by her best friend last week. On Saturday, her friends organised a hen do for her

Kayleigh and 17 of her friends boarded a party bus and headed to the TOWIE hot spot Sugar Hut Brentwood, Essex

And last Saturday, the mother-of-one 
was given the chance to enjoy another special day - a hen do at The Only
Way is Essex's chief party venue.

Her Friend Sarah Holness, 31, 
organised for a group of 17 girls to board a party bus and head towards 
the TOWIE hot spot Sugar Hut Brentwood, Essex.

Kayleigh, from Herne bay, Kent, said: 'I wanted to go to Sugar Hut just for a night out because I love TOWIE.

'My friend Sara organised it and managed to get me into the club for free. We got a party bus too and it was full of novelty straws and sachets.

'We just thought it was something that would be a bit of fun that we hadn't done before.

'The club itself is not what you 
would expect having watched the programme. It is a big club with a 
couple of floors and just full of normal Essex people.

'The whole thing was Sarah's idea after we had the wedding photoshoot and it was a fun night. It turned out to be a good idea.'

Last week her GP told her the illness is not getting any better, but Kayleigh says she remains determined not to let it get the better of her

Last week her GP told her the illness is
not getting any better but Kayleigh says she remains determined not to 
let it get the better of her.

She added: 'It looks like the tumour may have got bigger, but we are not 100 per cent certain.

'The chemotherapy might not be working, but we don't know anything for definite. If it isn't working, there is no point in being on it. The chemo makes me worse anyway.

'I feel better when I am not on it because then I am not ill all the time. It makes me so tired and I cannot eat properly.

'At the end of the day, I cannot change anything. This was what was laid out for me and I have got to get on with it.'

Kayleigh
suffers from a hereditary genetic disorder called familial adenomatous 
polyposis which causes growths on the  large intestine – raising the 
risk of developing cancer.

Kayleigh's father Lee was killed by the same condition in 1998, at the age of 37.

She was diagnosed with cancer last June and doctors operated on her to remove the growths.

But in February, follow-up tests found the illness had spread and medics told her she will never be fully rid of it.

They hope to prolong her life with regular chemotherapy. 

Fairytale wedding: Kayleigh Duff, 23, who has liver cancer, has already fulfilled her dying wish of marrying a male model

Kayleigh, who has been forced to quit her job as a kitchen assistant, now wants to devote as much time as possible to her son.

She said: ‘I take every day as it comes, but most of the time I’m all right.’

It
was her best friend Katie Birch who decided the absence of a current 
partner in her life need not stand in the way of  her dream of getting 
married.

Kayleigh was pampered by hair and make-up artists before being whisked to Whitstable Castle in Kent in a vintage Jaguar.

Guests included her mother Beverley Cox, 46, grandparents Sharon, 70, and Ian Day, 71, and Kayleigh’s two-year-old son Kai.

And waiting for her was handsome model Danny Wisker, booked for the day to play the role of groom.

Guests drank champagne while the ‘bride’ posed for pictures.

Kayleigh, from Herne Bay, Kent, said: ‘The groom was so nice and was really handsome.

‘It
was a bit awkward at first because obviously it’s a bizarre situation –
I couldn’t stop laughing. I didn’t expect any of it, it was mad.

'But It really was a dream come true. It 
was great. The dress was beautiful – it really was. The castle and 
everything were just beautiful.’
