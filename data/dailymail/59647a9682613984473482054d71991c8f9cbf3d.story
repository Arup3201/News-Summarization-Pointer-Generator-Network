They may sound like two of the most unlikeliest pairings ever to be considered in the beverage world, but Pepsi, the makers of Mountain Dew, has confirmed it is looking into creating a Dorito's nacho-cheese flavored version of the soda.

Disgusting though it may sound, the soft drink giant claims it is already testing a special brew among students at universities across the country - and the reviews aren't all that bad.

The company appears to have worked out how turn the addictive cheesy flavor of its tortilla chips snack into a drink.  

Gross or brilliant? PepsiCo is testing a soft drink that combines the cheesy flavor of Doritos chips with the sugar-bomb soda Mountain Dew

Liquid cheese in a botte: The reviewer wrote, 'Honestly wasn’t too disgusting. It just had a really strong Doritos aftertaste, which was odd.' Its not known if the drink will be on sale anytime soon

News of the bizarre new flavor spread online when a Redditor posted an image of an orange liquid he said Pepsi was giving out at a 'Mtn Dew Dewitos' booth.

'They were giving samples of this,' user joes_nipples captioned the photo. 'It actually tasted like Doritos.'

The Redditor went on to state that the sample of the classic sugar-fueled soft drink and the processed cheese masterpiece that is Doritos, 'wasn't that disgusting.'

'It tasted like orange with a doritos after taste. It tasted like straight doritos afterwards though. Weirdest thing I've ever drunken.' 

Spit or swallow? Students at Kent State University had the opportunity to 'Do the Dewitos.' Photos were posted showing a black stand emblazoned with 'Mtn Dew Dewitos' holding small taste-testing cups full of a bright orange soda

Familiar flavors: In 2008 Dorito's created a Mountain Dew flavored chip. Now they're making the reverse!

The new combination drink was spotted by the freshman at Kent State University in Ohio who tasted the 'DEWitos' drink when samples were being offered on campus. 

The user added that the flavor was 'like if you shoved a handful of Doritos in your mouth and chugged some Dew at the same time.'

'Someone at the Mountain Dew design department was getting really high,'

Other flavors up for consideration, according to the freshman, are lemon ginger, mango habanero and rainbow sherbet, which he said tasted like medicine.

Pepsi has now confirmed that the rumors are in fact true. 

'We are always testing out new flavours of Mountain Dew, and giving our fans a voice in helping decide on the next new product has always been important to us,' a Pepsi representative said.

'We opened up the DEW flavour vault and gave students a chance to try this Doritos-inspired flavor as part of a small program at colleges and universities.'

It's not known when the drink may be available in stores, however this isn't the first time Doritos have been combined with Mountain Dew. 

In 2008, FritoLay released a chip called 'Doritos Quest,' a 'mystery' chip whose secret ingredient was later revealed to be Mountain Dew. 

However, a nacho-flavored beverage seems much worse!
