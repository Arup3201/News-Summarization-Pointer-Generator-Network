Barack Obama could once count influential academic Cornel West as an ally, but the Princeton professor has become utterly disillusioned with the U.S leader, labelling him as a ‘counterfeit president’.

What’s more, that comment is just the tip of the iceberg, with Professor West - who lectures in African American Studies - also criticising Mr Obama’s policies on Wall Street, drones, national security and his response to the Michael Brown shooting.

West explains that he was hopeful for the future when Mr Obama came to power in 2005, but now believes the optimism was misplaced.

He told Salon: ‘It was like “we finally got somebody who can help us turn the corner”. He posed as if he was a kind of Lincoln… a progressive. He turned out to be counterfeit.

‘We ended up with a Wall Street presidency, a drone presidency, a national security presidency. The torturers go free. The Wall Street executives go free. The war crimes in the Middle East, especially now in Gaza, the war criminals go free.’

During Mr West’s savage attack he dismisses Mr Obama as a ‘neoliberal centrist with a smile and nice rhetorical flair… a brown-faced Clinton’.

The academic believes that arbitrary police power is one of the problems in Ferguson – and is dismayed that Mr Obama has not stepped forward to tackle it head on.

He said: ‘It has been going on for a long time. The Obama administration has been silent. Completely silent.’

Furthermore, he is incredulous, the interview reveals, that Mr Obama sent a letter of condolence to Robin Williams before sending one to the Michael Brown family. 

Mr West believes that Obama has been far too preoccupied with occupying the middle ground instead of championing bold policies.

He added: ‘He doesn’t realize that a great leader, a statesperson, doesn’t just occupy middle ground. They occupy higher ground or the moral ground or even sometimes the holy ground. But the middle ground is not the place to go if you’re going to show courage and vision.’
