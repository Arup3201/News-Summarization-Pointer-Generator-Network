Lawyers portrayed Thomas Kinkade's girlfriend as a ruthless gold digger who is out to 'tear down' the late artist's reputation and do irreparable damage to his family, in a restraining order granted by a judge today.

The order against Amy Pinto-Walsh claimed she broke a confidentiality agreement by talking to reporters the morning Mr Kinkade was found dead and threatened to reveal his business and personal secrets.

The artist's bodyguard - who drove him around after he was caught drink driving - said the family had reason to fear Pinto-Walsh because she was prone to 'impulsive and erratic' behavior and once threatened to 'tear Mr Kinkade down'.

Battle: The 'painter of light' Thomas Kinkade, one of America's most popular artist, died at the age of 54 after struggling with alcoholism, a family member said

Family: The artist's wife Nanette, pictured right with their four daughters, said her husband provided his family with a 'wonderful life'

His bodyguard Dean Baker was quited in court documents and said he was witness to her behavior when he accompanied them on numerous vacations.

'On one occasion Pinto-Walsh made a threat to Mr Kinkade along the 
lines of "I will tear you down. I would expect Pinto-Walsh to disclose confidential 
information,' Mr Baker said in his declaration filed on 
April 8.

A close friend of the family and godmother to the Kinkade children Linda Raasch left a similar declaration saying she was concerned about Pinto-Walsh's motives, according to the Mercury News.

She said: 'I told her releasing private and confidential documents would cause great emotional distress. But she was unmoved by my entreaties.'

Mistress Amy Pinto-Walsh hoped to marry the painter

However the artist's brother Patrick said Pinto-Walsh was a 'good and sweet person' and was surprised at the restraining order.

He told the Mercury News: 'Amy was Thom's girlfriend. They enjoyed each other immensely. She's a good
person, a sweet person. She cared about Thom.'

The request for the restraining order said: 'This
threat is not just a mean-spirited act of betrayal, but a calculated 
attempt to garner money and fame at the expense of the grieving Kinkade 
family, including his wife and four daughters.'

Though the painter had separated from his wife
about two years ago, their divorce was not finalized when he died three weeks ago of what is believed to have been natural causes.

Mr Kinkade was said to have been planning on
marrying Ms Pinto-Walsh as soon as the divorce was finalized. They had 
been dating for 18 months.

'Amy was already part of his circle of friends and that really enraged Nanette,' an unnamed source told Radar Online.

'Nanette was furious and humiliated that he not only cheated on her, but moved on so quickly and publicly with her.'

She didn't make any attempt to hide 
her frustration either, as she filed a restraining order against his 
mistress shortly after his death, wanting to stop her from breaching a confidentiality agreement she signed more than a year ago.

Nanette fears Amy Pinto-Walsh will attempt to sell her story and could release private family photographs.

Kinkade was one of the most 
successful artists in the U.S., but he struggled with alcoholism before 
his death at the age of 54, and split from his wife Nanette in 2010.

The so-called 'Painter of Light' used to estimate that around one out of every 20 homes in America.

His estate - of which Mrs Kinkade is 
the principal trustee - has filed documents with a Santa Clara court 
seeking an injunction against Ms Pinto-Walsh, according to Los Gatos 
Patch.

Struggle: The devout Christian had battled through a divorce and bankruptcy in recent years while also facing needling critics, his brother said

Painter of light: Mr Kinkade's talent, shown here in Living Waters: Golfer's Paradise, Hole One is a characteristic of his serene style that put roughly one of his paintings in every 20 homes

Success: Mr Kinkade's works were popular, but his battle with alcoholism led him to an arrest for DUI (right)

Its attorneys argue that the 
painter's mistress, who is still living in his mansion in Monte Sereno, 
California, is planning to disclose information which would breach a 
confidentiality agreement signed in February 2011.

The restraining order would ban Ms 
Pinto-Walsh from saying or doing anything which would make Kinkade, his 
wife or his business 'appear in a negative light or false light'.

She would also be prevented from 
writing or contributing to any sort of book, article or other 
publication about the late artist.

In particular, the lawsuit seeks to 
stop her divulging personal information which she found out 'as a 
personal assistant and companion to Thomas Kinkade'.

Three days after his death, Ms Pinto-Walsh told the paper: 'He died in his sleep, very happy, in 
the house he built, with the paintings he loved and the woman he loved.'

It was the
same day Windermere filed an initial request for a restraining order 
against her. The documents also dispute the date of Kinkade's death, 
stating that Kinkade died the night of April 5, not the next morning. 
The coroner is still investigating the cause of death.

In the confidentiality agreement Ms 
Pinto-Walsh signed in February 2011, she was said to be privy to 'trade secrets,' 
including Mr Kinkade's painting techniques and 'use of computer technology 
in painting'.

Father: Mr Kinkade, pictured here drawing his daughter Winsor, was said by his brother to have been cleaning himself up to remain in his children's lives

While it is not clear what exactly 
prompted the legal battle, the suit alleges that Ms Pinto-Walsh told a 
family friend that she intended to sell the story of her relationship 
with Kinkade and release unseen photographs of the painter.

The suit continues: 'The release of 
these items would be personally devastating not only for Mrs Kinkade, 
but also for the family's four daughters, who are grieving the sudden 
loss of their father.'

The family also fears that Ms 
Pinto-Walsh could jeopardise Kinkade's business empire, which relied on 
the production of prints and reproductions as much as original 
paintings.

They say she had access to 'trade 
secrets' such as the artist's painting techniques and computer 
programmes, and could try to sell them on to others.

Ms Pinto-Walsh, who had been in a 
relationship with Kinkade for 18 months before his death, told Los Gatos
Patch at the time that the painter 'had a heart condition'.

Mrs Kinkade's lawsuit cites this 
revelation of a 'non-public health condition' as one breach of Ms 
Pinto-Walsh's confidentiality agreement.

The suit also says that Kinkade died 
on the night of April 5, which contradicts previous reports that he was 
found dead the next morning.

While the artist was phenomenally 
successful and extremely wealthy, he apparently suffered from a drinking
problem throughout much of his life, and in June 2010 was arrested for 
drink-driving.

He was also saddened by constant attacks on the quality of his work by art critics, and devastated by his divorce from Nanette.
