There was carnage last night at the Darts Invitational Challenge in Melbourne as the crowd began throwing plastic chairs at each other in an attempt to create a ‘chair pyramid’.

Things escalated quickly as  chairs and tables were upended and sent flying around Etihad Stadium, as witnesses looked on in dismay as a riot erupted. 

Erratic fans were apparently seen urinating on the stadium floor, body-slamming patrons into the furniture and stamping on the tables until they broke in half.

'The night started really well but unfortunately a small minority did behave poorly,' he said.

'There'll be a major debrief and we are talking with police and our own security contractor. We won't shy away from what happened and invariably we learn something from every event.'

Mr Lane also said that the bar was only serving mid-strength beer and was closed down as soon as the violence started.
