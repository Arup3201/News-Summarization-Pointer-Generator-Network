Tony Abbott's wife Margie has revealed the unexpected chivalrous side of the Australian Prime Minister, speaking candidly about her husband's small acts of love- which include taking his shoes off.

Mrs Abbott said that when she complained to her husband that her heels were hurting her feet at the end of the couple's annual Christmas party, he suggested that she take her shoes off.

'If it makes you feel any better I’ll take mine off,' he said.

Despite chastising him for slipping off his RM Williams because it wasn't dignified, Mrs Abbott maintains that the gesture reflected the Prime Minister hidden gentlemanly nature.

'Absolutely. It was like trailing your coat over a puddle,' she told The Daily Telegraph.

She also added that her husband had 'a lot of grace', a quality which she said he needed during last Monday’s leadership spill vote.

The couple's daughter Frances reflected on the backlash Mr Abbott had faced from the media and rebel backbenchers, defending him as 'still doing a great job, which is that of our father.'

Speaking at the Myer Autumn/Winter show in Melbourne on Thursday, the fashion graduate said it was hard to see his name pulled through the mud on a regular basis.

'It always effects you when people you love are slammed in the media, it's not fun, but it's the nature of the beast... It's happened before and will happen again,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

Mr Abbott's daughter defended him as 'still doing a great job, which is that of our father.'

'For him, it's how he gets back up from that that will be a measure of his character. We will always support him.' 

Earlier this month the garrulous brunette spoke candidly about her relationship with her father, admitting that just like any daughter she constantly worries about him,  despite living in another city they are always in touch.

She moved from Sydney to Melbourne to focus on her career and, of course,  her father is based in Canberra. 

‘My standard text message is: “You’re doing an amazing job.”’ And he’ll reply: “Thanks angel,”’ she explained to Daily Mail Australia.

She also added: ‘I’m always thinking about him, especially with everything that’s happened recently with terrorism.'

The middle of Mr Abbott's three daughters, Frances, who works as an assistant buyer for the children's department in Myer, wen on to reveal the moment she got her 'A' tattoo, which she said he father wasn't originally supportive of.  

In 2013 she spoke to Who Magazine about the tattoo, explaining her father wasn't too happy about it at first.  

'I gave [mum and dad] a warning. I said, "I am getting one," and Dad said, "You are mutilating your body." Then I went and got it done and they thought it was pretty.'   

'I know my family name won't be carried on as my father didn't have any sons, so I thought I'm going to get it permanent on my back.' 

The brunette was not accompanied by her boyfriend Lindsay Smith, who also works for Myer, revealing he was having supper with his family.

It seems there are more hidden adornments on the Prime Minister's daughter's body.

She has also cheekily admitted to having more than just one inking on her body telling Daily Mail Australia: 'I might [have more tattoos] but you won't be seeing them.'

Last year Frances was embroiled in scandal when it was revealed that she received a scholarship for a university degree costing more than $60,000 from a long-time friend of the Prime Minister.

She accepted a 'chairman's scholarship' for her Bachelor of Design course from the Whitehouse Institute of Design, where Liberal supporter Les Taylor sits as chairman on the board of governors.

The fashion student studied at the Sydney institute from 2011 to December 2013 and received the award as a result of her 'application and art portfolio', a spokeswoman for the Prime Minister said.

 Mr Abbott had not declared the scholarship on his pecuniary interest register, despite previously declaring other matters relating to his children such as trips, accommodation and tickets to sporting events.
