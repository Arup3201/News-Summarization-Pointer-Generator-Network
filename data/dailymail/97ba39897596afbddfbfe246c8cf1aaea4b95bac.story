One of the four men killed in Tuesday’s deadly attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi was working on an intelligence mission to find dangerous weapons following the country’s violent revolution, it has been revealed.

Former Navy SEAL Glen Doherty said in an interview last month that he was working as a contractor with the U.S. State Department and was on a mission to find surface-to-air missiles, then destroy them.

He was killed along with America’s Ambassador to Libya, Christopher Stevens.

Killed: Glen Doherty, 42, has been named as one of the two security officials who died in the attack on the U.S. consolate in Benghazi on Tuesday night. He was a former SEAL and trained sniper

In the interview with ABC News, the contractor said that he went around Libya, following reports of possible MANPADS. U.S. officials were worried that these powerful weapons could fall into the hands of terrorists if left in-tact.

To destroy them, Doherty said that he would roll over the weapons in their vehicles.

Doherty, originally from Winchester, Massachusetts, was killed while seeking cover from gunfire in Benghazi in an attack that claimed the lives of three other Americans, including the U.S. ambassador.

Doherty, 42, who was active in a group that fights against religious proselytising in the U.S. army, was working for a private company providing security when he died, his sister, Kate Quigley, said.

'He was on security detail and he was 
protecting the ambassador and also helping the wounded' when he was 
killed, she told the Boston Globe.

'He was the most wonderful person,' his mother, Barbara Doherty, added to WCVB. 'We are all in pain and suffering.'

He worked as a ski instructor in Utah throughout his 20s and attended flight school before keeping a promise he had made himseld - that if he had no profession by the age of 30, he would join the Navy.

He trained as a sniper and medical officer with the Navy SEALs, and served in Iraq and Afghanistan He served for seven years before leaving to work at the security company four years ago.

Doherty had been on a tour of Libya and had returned to the country just six days before his death.

Loved: His family called Doherty 'the most wonderful person' and 'the best of the best' at his job

Devoted: He spent seven years in the Navy and worked against religious proselytising in the military

He was also reportedly an active member of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation (MRFF), an advocacy group which fights inappropriate religious encouragement inside the armed forces.

Doherty was also a trainer at Sealfit, a fitness company founded by a fellow SEAL veteran, and wrote on his Facebook page that he enjoyed biking, surfing and flying.

'You have to understand, Glen was 
highly 
trained. He was the best of the best. He wouldn't have gone down for 
some protest over a movie,' Quigley said, referring to reports he was 
killed amid riots across the Middle East over an anti-Islam film.

'This was serious, 
well-planned, well-executed. He was very good at what he did... I never thought he’d be another victim of September 11.'

According to reports from U.S. officials, Doherty died while trying to take cover from gunfire in the annex near the main consulate building.

He is the latest victim to be 
identified after the government confirmed U.S. Ambassador to Libya 
Chris Stevens, 52, a career diplomat devoted to bringing democracy to the North African nation, had died.

Sean Smith, a foreign service information 
management officer and married father-of-two who had been with the State Department for ten years, was also killed.

The name of the fourth American, also a security official, has not been disclosed.

They were killed when a 
group of U.S. employees went to the consulate to try to evacuate staff 
as the building came under attack by a mob wielding guns and rocket 
propelled grenades.

Stevens is the first U.S. ambassador to be killed in
an attack since 1979, when Ambassador Adolph Dubs was killed in 
Afghanistan.

Attack: The four men died after riots over an anti-Islamic film stormed past the U.S. embassy in Benghazi

Destruction: A man walks in the rubble of the consulate after the attack that claimed four Americans

An anti-Muslim
film was initially blamed for inflaming protestors who attacked and 
burned the consulate - but U.S. officials have since said the attack was
planned and used the riot as a cover.

They suggested it may be linked to Tuesday’s anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks, and may be a revenge attack by al Qaeda for an American drone killing their second-in-command in June.

The Obama administration has begun what appears to be a terrorist hunt in Libya, as evidence mounts that the attack was perpetrated by well-armed thugs and not an out-of-control crowd.

Marines have swooped in to protect the consulate, while drones may be sent over Libya to collect intelligence.
