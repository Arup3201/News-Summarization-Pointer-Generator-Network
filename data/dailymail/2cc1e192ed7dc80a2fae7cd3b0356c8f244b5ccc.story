The family of a dying grandmother have told how they smuggled ice lollies in to hospital after nurses left her so thirsty her lips cracked and bled.

Sandra Aston, 79, was ‘treated like an animal’ by nurses, who claimed they could not help when her family begged them to act as she became increasingly dehydrated.

While Mrs Aston was too weak to drink from a cup, her thirst could have been quenched with oral sponges. But staff did not provide these, leaving her family to feed her ice lollies they bought outside.

Tracey Holmes, 51, says that her mother, Sandra Aston, 79, was left in squalor and 'treated like an animal' in the week before she died at Alexandra Hospital, Redditch, in April last year

Mrs Aston (pictured with her daughter, Tracey Holmes) was initially misdiagnosed with pneumonia when she was admitted to Redditch Alexandra Hospital before X-rays revealed she had inoperable lung cancer

As they finally received a formal apology from the hospital, Mrs Aston’s family yesterday spoke of their ongoing distress about the way she was left to die with so little dignity.

Her daughter Tracy Holmes, 51, who lived close to her mother and father Robert, 80, in Evesham, Worcestershire, said medical staff deprived her dying mother of ‘basic human dignity’ in her final days. ‘My mother was left dehydrated, with no monitoring of her fluid or food intake,’ she added.

‘We constantly found her freezing cold, with cracked bleeding lips and in considerable distress due to her discomfort and desperate thirst. We even took to bringing her ice lollies because the hospital was unable to provide oral sponges. We fear that if we had not been there then Mum would have received nothing at all.’

She said the care received by her mother was ‘appalling’ and ‘no better than that given to a helpless animal’.

‘If Mum was to die then she deserved 
to do so peacefully and with dignity. She could have had a peaceful 
release, she could have said goodbye to her grandchildren.’

Mrs
Aston, a retired office manager, was admitted to Redditch Alexandra 
Hospital on April 19 last year. She was suffering with inoperable lung 
cancer and secondary liver cancer but was initially misdiagnosed as 
having pneumonia, despite the cancer showing up on X-rays.

Mrs Aston (pictured with her husband, Robert, in 1983) was left freezing cold, dehydrated and in great discomfort by staff at the hospital. Her family say that her lips cracked because they were so dry

The family were told that she was  dying of cancer only when she had days to live after a physiotherapist realised her health was rapidly deteriorating and further tests were run.

The grandmother-of-two died in appalling conditions less than a week after she was diagnosed with cancer. As her condition deteriorated, leaving her unable to drink properly, she became painfully dehydrated.

Mrs Holmes said agency nurses did not fill up her water supply by her bed. ‘Her mouth was so dry and she was so weak it was heart-breaking. I started taking in Ribena lollipops, the ones that are in the tubes, because that was all I could find.

It was only after a physiotherapist spotted Mrs Aston's health deteriorate and reported it to a senior doctor that the family were told how serious her condition was. She is pictured on her 70th birthday in 2004

‘The doctors and nurses weren’t happy about me taking them in but I just said, “no, we’re taking them in” and they let me in the end.’

After three days of persistent complaints, nurses finally began using wet sponges on Mrs Aston’s lips.

After her mother’s death, Mrs Holmes complained to Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust.

‘If we had known she had cancer she could have gone into a hospice and died with dignity instead of ending up so uncomfortable in a horrible room,’ she added.

‘The saddest thing was that Mum loved that hospital and had always chosen to go there. The place she put her faith and trust in let her down in the end.’

The trust’s chief nursing officer Helen Blanchard has written to Mrs Holmes, offering a ‘heartfelt and sincere’ apology. She added: ‘We have taken action to improve care.’
