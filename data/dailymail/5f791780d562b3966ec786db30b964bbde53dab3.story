The tip about the third most powerful House Republican giving a speech at a white supremacist meeting came from the family of a prominent Democrat in his home state - who once ran against him and lost.

Rep Steve Scalise’s political career has been thrown into turmoil after Robert Reed, the son of Louisiana liberal Gilda Reed, told a political blogger about Mr Scalise’s appearance at the 2002 event.

Miss Reed took on Mr Scalise in the 2008 Congressional race and has been Tweeting numerous articles about the row since it became public earlier this week.

In an interview she and her son admitted they had sat on the information for six years and only made it public when Mr Scalise was about to be re-elected as House Majority Whip.

STAYING: Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise spoke at an international convention of white supremacists in 2002 while serving as a member of his state's legislature, but House Speaker is letting him stay in leadership

Tipster: Failed candidate Gilda Reed's son Robert  spilled the beans about Scalise's speech to a white supremicist group to a liberal political blogger

The disclosure strongly suggests that Miss Reed was waiting for the best moment to try toruin Mr Scalise’s political career, but Mr Reed said that he just wanted ‘justice to be done’.

He told Talking Points Memo: ‘I don't like liars. I don't like people who misrepresent themselves or people who pander to neo-Nazi groups.

‘I could have let the nation know (in 2008) and I didn't.'

So far Mr Scalise has the support of the GOP establishment after apologizing for appearing at the 2002 convention of the European-American Unity and Rights Organization (EURO).

The organization has been described as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Centre and was founded by former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke.

Miss Reed, a mother-of-seven, is a psychology professor at the University of New Orleans and has been active in politics in Louisiana for decades.

Her son was her campaign manager when she took on Mr Scalise when he ran for Congress in 2008 in a special election when Bobby Jindal, the Republican, left his seat and ran for governor, but lost heavily.

They told Talking Points Memo that at the time they were approached by a credible source who told them about Mr Scalise’s attendance at the EURO meeting, which took place at a Best Western hotel just outside New Orleans.

Mr Reed said he ‘desperately wanted to use it’ but they decided not to - until last week when they told Lamar White, Jr, a liberal political blogger based in New Orleans.

MY MAN: House Speaker John Boehner (right) held a press conference in June to announce the election of Scalise (left) as the House Majority Whip – and he is standing by him as the racially-steeped controversy boils

The Reeds also claimed that their source had more information but they have refused to be identified for fear of reprisals.

The disclosure that Miss Reed was involved in the story has led to accusations she has engaged in murky party politics.

A commenter on a Louisiana political website wrote: ‘One of the talk radio stations was reporting she was reportedly upset with Rep Scalise because she thinks he can save UNO's psychology department from being cut in the next round of Louisiana State budget cuts because UNO is working on eliminating her position. So she purportedly pulled out the hit piece.’

The reaction to the row in Washington has been mixed: House Speaker John Boehner has said Mr Scalise has his ‘full confidence’ and other senior GOP leaders have given him their backing.

However prominent conservative commentator Erick Erickson Tweeted: ‘How Do You Show Up at a David Duke Event and Not Know What It Is?’

John Weaver, a GOP consultant who has advised Senator John McCain, told the Washington Post that Mr Scalise ‘cannot serve in leadership in our party as we’re in the process of trying to show the American people we can handle the burden of governing, especially in a country so divided across all demographic lines’.

RACIAL ALLIANCE? David Duke (left), then grand wizard of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in Louisiana, participated in a cross-burning in May 1977 near New Orleans; an organization he later ran invited then-state legislator Steve Scalise to speak at a meeting, and Scalise has apoloigized for doing so

Scalise has said that he did not know who EURO was when he gave his speech and that he condemns their views.

However this has been undermined by conflicting accounts from Mr Duke and Kenny Knight, Mr Duke’s former campaign adviser.

Mr Duke has said that ‘Kenny would keep Scalise up to date on my issues’ and that Mr Scalise ‘recognised how popular I was in his own district’.

Mr Knight has said that Mr Scalise ‘knew who I was’ but claimed that the politician’s speech took place before the EURO event and just happened to be in the same venue.

Mr Scalise’s denials have been rubbished by the Southern Poverty Law Centre which has called on him to resign.

In a post on organization’s website Mark Potok wrote: ‘Scalise’s claim of ignorance is almost impossible to believe.

‘He was a state representative and an aspiring national politician at the time, and EURO already was well known as a hate group led by America’s most famous white supremacist.’

Mr Potok said that the day before Mr Scalise spoke, a minor league baseball team cancelled its stay at the hotel where the event took place after hearing that EURO was meeting there.

Roll Call’s Niels Lesnewski also discovered an interview from 1999 in which Mr Scalise said he knew who Mr Duke was and appeared to back some of his policies.
