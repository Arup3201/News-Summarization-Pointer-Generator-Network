The British lover of Google co-founder Sergey Brin, 40, has found herself the target of heavy abuse online after news of her affair with the married multi-billionaire emerged.

Amanda Rosenberg, 27, who attended one of the UK's most exclusive schools with Kate Middleton has been accused of 'sleeping her way to the top' and of destroying Brin's marriage of six years to Anne Wojcicki.

Google has been rocked by talk of the romance, and a spokesman confirmed this weekend that Brin – one of the world’s richest men with a $22 billion fortune - has been living apart from his wife and mother of his two children.

Abuse: Amanda Rosenberg has come under attack on her Google + profile for her alleged affair with the internet giants co-founder, Sergey Brin

The abuse has been posted to Rosenberg's Google + account, with one individual known as Bill Kowba commenting on a picture, 'Was this photo taken before or after you slept with a married man and destroyed his marriage.?'

Another irate person, under the handle Jan Vries, wrote, 'You are such a soulless person. No morality. Ruining a man's life. Think of his two children...Shame on you.'

However, the abuse was not totally one sided, with others standing up for her.

'Do you have nothing better to do than write nasty comments to this girl?' someone else wrote, under the handle holdengirl02 1.

If they divorce, Californian law suggests their 
massive fortune would have to be halved – although they reportedly 
signed a strict pre-nuptial agreement.

While the internet was agog 
with talk of Brin romancing his much younger employee, the Daily Mail 
tracked down a distinctly unsurprised former boyfriend of Miss Rosenberg
 – who said she ‘knew the power of her womanly ways’.

Ewan Butler, 
28, a trainee teacher living with his parents in Darlington, said: 
‘Amanda’s a good looking girl, and she knows she is.

'And she’s good at 
“playing” men – she played me.’

Brin’s relationship with Rosenberg 
emerged only yesterday – but the pair were pictured together earlier 
this year at a New York Fashion Week event, both wearing the 
controversial Google Glass computerised spectacles for which she is 
marketing manager.

An employee of Google since she graduated with a 
communications degree from Leeds University, she initially worked for 
the internet giant in London before last year moving to San Francisco to
 work at its Silicon Valley nerve center.

She soon won a role 
promoting Google Glass, widely criticised as the glasses which enable 
users to film and broadcast over the internet everything they see 
non-stop, worrying privacy campaigners.

Miss Rosenberg wrote an 
online blog soon after she arrived – describing herself as a 
‘misanthropic Brit struggling to come to terms with Californian 
optimism’.

She wrote: ‘I’d been living a beautifully choreographed 
life in London for pretty much my entire life; family, friends, job, 
life. Then one day I realized the beauty had faded.

‘So I applied for a transfer with my company to a different country. Yes! The romance of a transfer!

‘Luckily for me this all worked out like I dreamed it would...NOT. Of course it didn’t work out like that!

‘I
 remember having conversations with people about moving countries, and 
no one talks about how it felt to be alone.

'I wanted to grab them and 
scream “Why are you not telling me about how you ate lunch in the 
toilets at work for the first week because no one talked to you?”.’

activate them

Connected but no longer together: Brin and his estranged wife are bound together by business dealings - he is an investor in her DNA company 23andMe - and the children they share.

 first thought in her new office was: ‘Hello new boss, hello new 
team...LIKE ME IMMEDIATELY.’ 

Sergey Brin, 40, is being roundly mocked on the internet over his apparent relationship with Amanda Rosenberg.

One of numerous websites ridiculing the reported affair draws particular attention to his recent enthusiasm for the ‘Google Glass’ computerised spectacles.

The website jibes: ‘Since Google Glass launched the company’s co-founder, Sergey Brin, hasn’t been spotted without a pair.

'He’s placed himself atop the privacy-eroding project, publicly, and inside Google’s secret labs.

'Maybe it’s because he’s f****** the Glass marketing manager, Amanda Rosenberg.’

The blog goes on: ‘Knowing that one of the most vital, powerful men at the company has been using Google’s most ambitious product as a dating pool won’t be smooth news for the rest of the team.’

She also wrote that she was initially so 
shy she failed to turn up at her first work drinks invitation, fearing 
she would be ‘the weird loner in the corner’, so stayed in eating 
biscuits alone on her sofa instead.

In an internet profile Miss 
Rosenberg wrote of herself: ‘I’m part of the master race that is the 
Chinese Jew or Chew, if you will.

'Born in Hong Kong but bred in the UK. A
 misanthrope who’s bad at maths, so I got the worst of both worlds.’

Elsewhere
 she declares that her motto is: ‘He who hesitates is a damned fool.’

Miss Rosenberg is understood to have an English father and a Hong Kong 
Chinese mother who worked as an investment banker.

After leaving 
Marlborough, where Pippa Middleton was two years above her she soon began a year-long relationship
 with fellow Leeds University student Mr Butler.

Told his ex was 
being linked to the Google tycoon, he said: ‘It wouldn’t surprise me in 
the least – she’s that kind of girl.’

He added: ‘Although Amanda did 
have a posh crew she knocked around with she wasn’t stuck up like you 
might expect from a Marlborough girl.

'With me I think there was a 
fascination with me being northern – I was pretty much the only person 
in our student halls who went to a comprehensive.’

Intriguingly Miss 
Rosenberg had already had a high-flying Google boyfriend in America – 
senior executive Hugo Barra, who recently announced he was leaving to 
join a Chinese computer firm.

Last night Miss Rosenberg – who got her
 Google Glass job after coming up with the voice command ‘Ok, Glass’ to 
activate the device - could not be contacted for comment.

A spokesman
 for Brin – who founded Google with Larry Page in 1998 – said that he 
was not legally separated from his wife and that ‘they remain good 
friends and partners’.
