A once morbidly obese man has transformed his life by dramatically losing 10st after he couldn't fit on a fairground ride seat with his son.

Father-of-one Mark Rushmer put an end to his junk food diet after finding he couldn't take his son Morgan, nine, on a ride at Skegness Pleasure Beach.

Morgan had begged Mark, who was 25st at his heaviest, to go on the white-knuckle fair rides but he was simply too big to fit in the seats.

Mark's weight has dropped from about 25 stone (left) to an svelte 15 stone 2 pounds (right)

Mark, from Derby, said: ‘We only get to go Skegness once a year.

‘I've always managed to squeeze into the seats of the children's rides so I could go on them with Morgan but it was painful.

‘Now he is nine years old, he wanted to go on the bigger rides that went upside down but I couldn't fit in them.

‘It was horrible for him. Other dads were going on with their children but I couldn't.’

As soon as he returned from the trip last Easter Mark decided to make a change.

Mark, 40, said: ‘I began researching on the internet for local dieting groups.

‘I've messed about with diets my whole life. Every new year's resolution would be to lose weight.

‘I'd diet for a week or a fortnight and then always stop. Whether it be Weight Watchers or Slimming World, I'd always give in.

‘Because I work long hours and I get home late, I never really had the time to do it or I wouldn't be bothered.

Mark ditched his high carbohydrate diet for the Lighter Life diet where all food is replaced by specially prepared meals and sachets. He has now reintroduced 'normal' healthy foods into his diet

‘I was touching 40 so I knew I had to do something. I knew of people around me who'd had heart attacks and diabetes and it scared me.'

Logistics manager Mark says that as a young child he was always 'chubby'.

He said: ‘Up until I was 22, I was quite slim, but when I was 25 I started to get bigger.

‘I'd been introduced to pubs, clubs and takeaways and I got even bigger over the next 15 years until I reached 25st, which was my heaviest.’

Breakfast: A bowl of porridge, fruit and fibre or muesli

Lunch: Fruity cous-cous and a yoghurt

Dinner: Low-fat protein such as chicken with plenty of green vegetables

Exercise: Mark now does lots of  high-energy sports including squash, horse riding and go-karting

His previous diet would include skipping breakfast, indulging in carbs and a lack of exercise.

Mark said: 'I'd get up at 4am and not eat anything until around 9am when I'd have a big breakfast with bacon, sausage, the works.

‘I never bothered making a packed lunch so I'd buy sandwiches, crisps, pop and chocolate.

Then in the evenings I'd eat quite healthily but it would be carbohydrates like pasta and rice.

‘I used to eat a lot of bread as well. I'd eat four to six slices of toast in one go.’

In May last year, he turned to the LighterLife weight loss management programme, a counselling service in Littleover, weighing in at 24st 12lb.

He undertook the Total programme, where ordinary food is replaced by specially-formulated food packets per day alongside weekly counselling sessions to assess the psychological issues behind over-eating.

Mark said: ‘There were packet soups, breakfast porridge, cereal bars, even shepherd's pie and chilli con carne, but you had to add water to it all.

His weight loss has allowed Mark to spend his weekends doing high-energy activities including sports, squash, horse riding and go-karting with his son

‘The porridge was more like a hot milky drink.The first two to three weeks were very very hard but I was determined to do it.

'We even went on an all-inclusive holiday to Menorca in July and I stuck to the diet. I had no alcohol or ice-cream.’

He later moved on to a diet where 'proper' food was gradually introduced. Four months later, in September, he achieved his target weight of 16st.

He then took the dieting even further and dropped to 15st 2lb.

Now his daily routine includes eating a healthy and balanced diet.

He said: ‘I'll have porridge, fruit and fibre or muesli for breakfast.

‘Now I feel good about myself, I've found that I stop worrying about what people think about me' says Mark

Then fruity cous cous and a yoghurt for lunch and lots of green vegetables and chicken or protein in the evening.

‘Now I only eat pasta or rice once a fortnight.’

To celebrate his weight loss he took his partner Caroline and Morgan to Alton Towers.

Mark said: 'Morgan absolutely loved it.

‘He is extremely proud of me, telling everyone we meet what his dad has achieved. The sheer delight on Morgan's face was worth every second.’

Now Mark spends his weekends with high-energy activities including sports, squash, horse riding and go-karting.

He said: ‘We're so much more active now.

‘Doing things together as a family unit has made a difference to Caroline and Morgan. We're much happier and closer.

‘Life is all up for grabs now, Caroline and I have booked a flight in a helicopter and I'm finding that I want to try anything and everything.

‘We've been horse-riding and I play more sports than I ever used to. I even join in with Morgan when he goes go-karting. We're pretty evenly matched, too, so often it's touch and go as to who wins.

Not only does Mark feel better, he says he looks better too.

He said: ‘A few people have said I'm much cheekier now, I'm not 100 per cent sure what they mean by that, but I have definitely noticed that my confidence has received a major boost.

‘Now I feel good about myself, I've found that I stop worrying about what people think about me.

‘I used to dread going shopping with Caroline as there was probably only one place where I could realistically buy clothes from but now there's no stopping me.

‘It tends to be me dragging her around the shops, buying more clothes than I could ever possibly need.’
