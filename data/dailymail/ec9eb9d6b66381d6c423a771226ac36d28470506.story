A woman who was acquitted of fatally 
shooting her violent, cross dressing husband says she did not have sex 
with him for 10 years because of his lust for transvestite prostitutes.

Barbara Sheehan, 52, of Queens, New 
York, spoke out in her first interview since being released on $1 
million bond Monday from Rikers Island.

She is awaiting sentencing for weapons
possession in connection with her 2008 slaying of husband Raymond, a 
former police officer.

The abuse is over: Barbara Sheehan, 52, said she faced years of violent rages from her husband Raymond

Sheehan told WPIX/Channel 11 News: 'I don’t know if there were actually affairs.

'I think it was more prostitution kind of stuff which happened randomly with different people, which as far as I was concerned is why the sex stopped in my life.

'He would meet up with young people and he would dress like a woman, they would dress like a woman.

'It’s been at least 10 years since we had any sex.'

Sheehan said there were never any women involved.

'He was into that, diapers, acting like a baby, or having someone else act like a baby.

'He wanted me to watch him do things. He would do things to himself.'

The interview airs tonight and tomorrow

A jury acquitted Sheehan early this month of murder, the New York Post reports.

Her defense was that she fatally shot the former NYPD sergeant 11 times with two guns after decades of abuse because she feared that he was about to kill her.

Her lawyer Michael had said in 2008 that Raymond’s intense 'self-loathing' and 'Irish sense of guilt' over his trysts with 'she-males' apparently caused him to be even more violent with his wife.

He said that guilt would often send him into a rage.

Sheehan says she now wants to find love and is taking college classes to one day become a social worker.

But she was convicted of weapons possession in the case and faces three-and-a-half to 15 years in prison when she is sentenced on November 10.

Sheehan is already appealing the conviction.

Because of the conviction Sheehan has lost her $50,000-a-year job as a secretary at IS 364 school in Brooklyn.

There is a chance she could get her job back if she wins her appeal.

Her school colleagues tesified during her trial about how she woould turn up for work with injuries.

School safety officer Valerie Levant told how one day she followed Sheehan into the ladies room.

'She took off the shades, and she had two black eyes,' she said.

Legal experts said the case was a test of the battered-woman defence.

This is when the history of abuse is explored to explain a woman's mental state at the time she is accused of committing a crime.

The issue is self-defence, which under New York state law justifies the use of lethal force in response to an immediate threat to life.

Under the battered-woman defence, lethal force can sometimes be justified even if the threat may not appear immediate.

Sheehan testified her husband smashed her head against a cinder-block wall when they were on holiday in 2007, reported the New York Times.

On the day of the killing in February 2008 he allegedly threw boiling pasta sauce at her and punched her in the face.

‘She acted out of defence,’ her daughter Jennifer Joyce said. ‘There were no other options. He was pointing a gun to her head.’

Sheehan's son Ray added: ‘I don't think people understand how bad it was at home.

‘I don't think they understand how my father threatened to kill us and how if we told anybody about what he was doing that he'd kill us too.'
