A freak 11-stone halibut has been line caught off the Shetland coast and is expected to serve up to 300 people.

The huge fish is believed to be about 50 years old and is about three times the size of regular halibut catches.

The remarkable fish has been sold to a seafood restaurant for £950 where it will be made into roughly 300 portions and make the establishment three times the cost in profit.

Human-sized: The giant halibut is longer than Crabshakk's head chef David Scott

Monster: The enormous halibut, caught off the Shetland coast, is believed to be about 50 years old

Big operation: Restaurant owner John Macleod said they would be unlikely to see such a large fish again

The catch is immediately being put on the menu and will be served to customers this weekend.

The giant fish is so big, it is longer than head chef David Scott, who was given the task of filleting it.

Mr Scott, head chef at the restaurant, where fish and chips sells for £9.50, will turn the massive halibut into fillets, scampi and curry.

The rare halibut was line-caught in the deep waters off the North Sea, near Shetland, Scotland, by commercial fishermen.

Crabshakk owner John Macleod said: 'I don't think any of us will ever see a bigger wild halibut than this.'

Pricey: The restaurant paid £950 for the whopper fish but expect to make three times that amount

All hands on deck: The entire team of chefs helped to fillet the fish, which will be divided into about 300 portions

Enormous: Despite weighing in at 11-stone, the halibut is still shy of the 34-stone record

A spokesman for supplier John Vallance said: 'Finding a 70kg halibut is extremely rare, and certainly not as common as the usual 20-30kg.'

At 11-stone (70kg) the huge fish is still somewhat shy of the largest halibut ever caught.

In 2010, veteran German angler Günther Hansel, 70, reeled in a 34-stone (220kg monster) which was sold for £2,500.

The previous largest halibut was a 33-stone (210kg) fish caught off Norway in 2009.

Atlantic halibut are among the largest fish in the world and can grow up to 15ft long.

They have been overfished in the past few decades and have been placed on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's red list and listed as endangered.
