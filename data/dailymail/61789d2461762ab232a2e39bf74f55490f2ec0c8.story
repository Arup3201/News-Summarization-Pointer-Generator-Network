Rory McIlroy put his personal problems behind him on Thursday as he started his bid for glory at the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth.

The Northern Irishman only announced his split from his fiancee, tennis star Caroline Wozniacki, on Wednesday but he was immediately back in action at the European Tour's flagship event.

McIlroy was four under after 15 holes of an opening round interrupted by storm delays and sits six behind early leader Thomas Bjorn.

One to watch: Spectators surrounded the third green to get a look at McIlroy in his opening round

Local 
knowledge and a fierce determination not to drift into obscurity paid 
massive dividends for former Wentworth resident Bjorn.

Bjorn
 hailed the best round of his entire career after carding a brilliant 62
 courtesy of eight birdies and an eagle, a round completed just moments 
before the first of two suspensions of play due to the threat of 
lightning.

'I
 was signing my scorecard when the siren went and Stephen Gallacher 
looked at me and says, 'You're not having a very bad day, are you'?" 
Bjorn said. 'We could kind of feel there was something going on in the 
weather, so it was nice to get in.'

At
 10 under par, Bjorn held a two-shot lead over Ireland's Shane Lowry, 
with France's Gary Stal six under and Henrik Stenson and Players 
Championship winner Martin Kaymer another two strokes back.

Stenson
 could need as little as a top-30 finish this week to replace Adam Scott
 as world No 1, the Australian beginning the Crowne Plaza Invitational 
with a one-over-par 71.

Bjorn
 missed the cut in last week's Spanish Open and feared the worst in a 
tournament that has produced just one top-10 finish (in 1998) in 16 
previous appearances.

Out in front: Thomas Bjorn leads the tournament after shooting a stunning 62 in his first round

'You
 shoot great rounds in your career but to shoot 62 on this course, you 
can't ask for more,' said Bjorn, who went on to win the European Masters
 in 2011 the last time he shot 62 on the European Tour.

'I
 don't really know where to start. Last week was awful and I was 
starting to feel a little frustrated with things. Practice this week, I 
was not good either.

'To
 step out on this course of all courses and play like I did today was 
surprising. Although I lived here for nine years it's not a place where I
 think it's going to be a great week, but I have to stick my head down 
now and focus on the rest of the week.'

Pin-point accuracy: This approach to the 18th set up a birdie for Bjorn - the eighth of a stunning opening round

Thomas reigns in the rain: The umbrellas were up as Bjorn holed out to complete his first round

Bjorn,
 who looks set to qualify for his first Ryder Cup appearance since 2002,
 birdied the second, fourth and seventh to reach the turn in 32 before a
 superb scoring burst on the back nine.

The
 43-year-old birdied the 10th and 11th and holed from just six feet for 
an eagle on the par-five 12th, before picking up further birdies on the 
14th, 16th and 18th.

Wet and wild: The rain hammered down at Wentworth as play was suspended twice

Asked
 to explain his renaissance after falling out of love with the game five
 or six years ago, Bjorn added: 'Hard work. Determination to not let a 
golf career fade away.

'I've
 just been determined to get myself to where I can play with the best in
 the world and I'll keep continuing to do that as long as my body allows
 me to.

'I enjoy being out here, which I probably didn't do for a couple of years.

'It's
 very easy when you get past 40 to stop enjoying this after a long 
career. I have travelled with my golf clubs since I was 14 years old and
 sometimes you forget why you love the game and it becomes hard work.'

Ruled out: Sergio Garcia has been forced to withdraw from the tournament with a knee injury after an opening round of 73

Bjorn
 is currently third in the Ryder Cup qualifying race but added: 'I still
 think I need to do a lot more. There's a lot of guys playing great golf
 at the moment and over the last few weeks a few names are all starting 
to come back into the frame.

'I've
 watched a lot from the sidelines (he has been vice-captain three times)
 and that can hurt a little bit, but I wanted to play in another Ryder 
Cup and I've got to stay focused and determined to keep playing good 
golf to get there.'

Lowry's
 round was twice disrupted by the bad weather, but the 27-year-old - who
 won the Irish Open as an amateur in 2009 - was not about to say a bad 
word about the tournament.

'I love it around here,' said Lowry, who was fourth in 2011 and 12th last year. 'It's a great event. It's a great golf course.

'I've been struggling and my best finish this season was last week, tied 15th in the Spanish Open.

'I've
 missed a few cuts and haven't really been putting that well but I 
managed to find something at home a couple of weeks ago and hopefully 
can keep it going.

'I went back to an old putter that I used years ago and it brought back good memories maybe.'

A knee injury meant that Sergio 
Garcia had retired from the tournament after opening with a round of 73,
 one over par, this morning.
