His mother is know for being a fashion trendsetter and just hours after he touched down in Sydney, it appears young Prince George is following in her footsteps.

The Duke of Cambridge was seen holding a kangaroo bag for his son as he waited to board a flight to New Zealand.

The Australian Koala Foundation is one of the stockists of the bag and sold out of its remaining stock of the bag this morning.

Joey for George: Prince William can be seen holding his young son's kangaroo backpack as they wait to board the flight to New Zealand

Within hours of Prince William being photographed with the bag, demand for the rucksack soared

CEO Deborah Tabart said while the organisation did not give the young prince the backpack, it would be more than happy to offer him a koala bag as a gift.

'We sold the last ones (kangaroo bags) this morning - we've had to take them off the website but we'll ordering more today,' she said.

Ms Tabert said the sudden rush of orders for the kangaroo bag, which was selling for $12.50, was a result of the Prince William seen carrying one.

With the bag stocked at numerous outlets, Ms Tabart said there was no way of knowing how Prince Willian go it, but she offered him an invitation to become the patron of the organisation on the back of his interest in conservation.

'We would love it if George had a koala bag,' Ms Tabart said.

The CEO also offered to extend the invitation to young George. 'He could be the patron in waiting,' Ms Tabart said of the 28-year old conservation orgnaisation.

The tiny future king was photographed by local media as he was carried onto a New Zealand Air Force jet at Sydney airport by his mother, the Duchess of Cambridge.

The couple is about to embark on a three-week tour of New Zealand and Australia on behalf of the Queen - and insisted on taking their son with them.

The family left London on at 9.25pm on Saturday night on a commercial Qantas flight, taking up the whole of the First Class cabin area.

And instead of hawking themselves from city to city, as is customary on overseas royal visits, William and Kate will base their young son in three different ‘hubs’: Wellington, Sydney and Canberra.

The arrangement means his doting parents will be able to travel back to see George almost every night – bar a stop-over in Queenstown, New Zealand, and another at Ayers Rock in Australia.

‘It’s a long way to go and [would mean] a long time away from their son,’ the couple’s private secretary, Miguel Head, said earlier this month.

‘The tour has been designed with Prince George’s consideration and comfort in mind.

‘Taking a nine month old on a Royal tour is not a first, but it has not happened in this Royal Family’s context for many, many years so there has been much to think about – as any new parent travelling long distance will recognise.’

Royal aides have warned that George’s scheduled public appearances are open to change given his young age and the fact that no-one knows how he will cope with the long journey and time difference.

Sources have told Mail Online that the little prince is also teething – as well as starting to crawl - which will only add to the unpredictability.

It is hoped that George will undertake another official engagement while in Australia when he visits Taronga Zoo where the Bilby (a native, long-eared rat-type marsupial) Enclosure was named after the little prince when he was born.

But the baby will be left behind when the couple visit the legendary Ayer’s Rock, or Uluru as it is known by the Aboriginal population and enjoy a night’s ‘glamping’ in a luxury resort.
