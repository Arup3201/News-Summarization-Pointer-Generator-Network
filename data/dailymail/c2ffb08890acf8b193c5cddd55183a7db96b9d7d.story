People with the rare AB blood group are more likely to develop memory loss, a study has found.

U.S. researchers found that people with the rare bloody type were 82 per cent more likely to develop thinking and memory problems that can lead to dementia, than  people with other blood types.

The new study comes on the back of past research which suggests  people with blood type O have a lower risk of heart disease and stroke, thus decreasing the risk of memory loss and dementia.

Researchers analysed a group of people, aged 45 and above, for an average of more than three years.

U.S. researchers found that people with rare blood group AB were 82 per cent more likely to develop the thinking and memory problems that can lead to dementia, than people with other blood types

They identified 495 participants who developed thinking and memory problems or cognitive impairment, during the study.

They were compared with 687 people with no cognitive problems.

People with AB blood type made up six per cent of those who developed cognitive impairment - higher than the four per cent of the general population with the blood group.

Author Dr Mary Cushman, of the University of Vermont College of Medicine, said the new study supports the idea that having a certain blood group may give a lower risk for heart disease and stroke, which in turn protects the brain.

She said: 'Our study looks at blood type and risk of cognitive impairment, but several studies have shown that factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes increase the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia.

'Blood type is also related to other vascular conditions like stroke, so the findings highlight the connections between vascular issues and brain health.'

Researchers said the study supports previous research which suggests having a certain blood group, like O, gives a lower risk for heart disease and stroke, which in turn protects the brain

She added: 'More research is needed to confirm these results.'

Researchers also looked at blood levels of factor VIII, a protein that helps blood to clot. High levels of factor VIII are related to higher risk of cognitive impairment and dementia.

People in this study with higher levels of factor VIII in their blood were 24 per cent more likely to develop thinking and memory problems than people with lower levels of the protein.

People with AB blood had a higher average level of factor VIII than people with other blood types.

Study found that people with rare blood type AB were 82% more likely to develop memory loss than people with other blood types

Thinking and memory problems can be early signals of dementia, although the study did not look at dementia itself

Of the people that developed memory problems, 6% had blood type AB - higher than the 4% of people in the population with this blood type

Previous studies show people with blood group O have a lower risk of heart disease and stroke
