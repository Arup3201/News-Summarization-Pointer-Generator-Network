If you're planning to move house, you may wish to set your sights on the lush Welsh countryside rather than the bustling streets of London.

House prices in many parts of Britain's capital have soared by more than 40 per cent - well above their previous peaks in 2007.

Meanwhile, asking prices across areas of Wales, the Midlands and the north have plummeted by at least 20 per cent, according to a new study.

Divergence: House prices in parts of London have soared by more than 40 per cent, while asking prices across areas of Wales, the Midlands and the north have plummeted by at least 20 per cent, according to a new study

The shocking figures have been revealed in a report on the 'great housing divide' by the Smith Institute think tank.

They show that the cost of living in London's most sought-after hotspots has shot up by 43 per cent since the peak of November 2007 - with even the least desirable parts of the capital rising in price by more than 20 per cent.

Property prices in the City of Westminster have jumped by 43.2 per cent to £863,256, while the average house in Kensington and Chelsea now costs a staggering £1,171,320 (an increase of 42.8 per cent).

However, in the same six-year period, prices have fallen by a whopping 47.7 per in Blaenau Gwent in Wales, according to The Observer.

Fall: Across all of England and Wales, the average house price has decreased by 9 per cent to £166,000

Expensive: Property prices in the City of Westminster have jumped by 43.2 per cent to £863,256, while the average house in Kensington and Chelsea now costs a staggering £1,171,320 (an increase of 42.8 per cent)

Decrease: Meanwhile, Blaenau Gwent in South Wales has seen house prices fall by 47.7 per cent since 2007

And they have decreased by 36.2 per 
cent to £83,241 in Knowsley, Merseyside, 34.5 per cent to £74,229 in 
Blackpool, 33 per cent to £83,392 in Liverpool and 32 per cent to 
£79,073 in Durham.

However,
 some areas of the Midlands and the north have only seen small falls - 
such as York, where the average house price has dropped by 1.4 per cent 
to £186,875.

Across all of England and Wales, the average house price has decreased by 9 per cent - now standing at £166,000.

The
 report warns that the rapidly diverging house prices could result in 
disastrous economic and social consequences - fuelling wealth 
inequalities between regions.

It adds that investors continue to pump more money into already pricey areas as the returns are greater for developers.

This means that the country's less prosperous regions are left behind.

'What
 we have witnessed over the past six years is the growth of two distinct
 and divergent housing markets: a London-centric property market where 
house prices have recovered and in some cases soared, and the rest of 
England and Wales where prices are flat and transactions are low,' says 
Smith Institute director Paul Hackett in the report.

He adds that the divergence is 'deep-rooted' in nature - with jobs and growth concentrated in London and the south-east.

The report comes amid concerns that soaring rents in these regions have resulted in a sudden rise in homelessness.

Last month, Business Secretary Vince Cable warned there is ‘clearly still a danger of house prices getting out of control’.

And on Friday, the Bank of England's chief economist Spencer Dale said the housing market could turn ‘from lukewarm to scalding hot in a few economic seconds’.

This weekend, Labour's shadow minister for London, Sadiq Khan, has unveiled plans to help people who are trying to get on the capital's housing ladder.
