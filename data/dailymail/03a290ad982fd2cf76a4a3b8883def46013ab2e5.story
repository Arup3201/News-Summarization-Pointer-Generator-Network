Lionel Messi

At 15, Lionel Messi was part of Barcelona's affiliate youth teams but was reportedly almost released from the club a year later due to financial reasons. Barcelona will count their lucky stars that they kept faith with the diminutive Argentine as he has developed in to one of the world's best ever players.

Cristiano Ronaldo 

At 16, Cristiano Ronaldo was a scrawny teen with Sporting Lisbon, but would turn into a world class athlete

Ronaldo was a young player making his way through Sporting's youth system when he was diagnosed with a racing heart, a condition which may have forced him to give up football. He had an operation and was back playing soon after - and was soon attracting interest from the likes of Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United.

Wayne Rooney

Gareth Bale

Gareth Bale was an all-round athlete in his school days, playing rugby, hockey and athletics. Despite being on the books of Southampton, there was reportedly doubts about whether he would make the grade due to his height. He, of course, was a famously late bloomer and is now starring for Real Madrid and Wales.

Radamel Falcao

Raheem Sterling
