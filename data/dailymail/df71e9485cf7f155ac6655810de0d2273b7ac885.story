When, early one morning, my partner and I told our 11-year-old son we were going to get married after 15 years together, he excitedly rushed to school and broke the good news to his teachers.

Months later, after proudly acting as ring bearer at the register office and delivering the best man speech at our wedding party, Thomas declared it had been the best weekend of his life.

So eight years on, in 2007, when my husband Christian walked out, the personal sense of loss and anguish that I felt was accompanied by a profound sense that we had let down our son. I was convinced he would now see love as an illusion, a sham, and that his view of marriage would be skewed for ever. 

Thomas (right) said that his mother Linda' s wedding to his father Christian was the 'best weekend of his life'

My husband believed that if our relationship was to end, it should be when our son was going off to university. He said this would be ‘best’ for Thomas, in so far as he was grown up enough to lead an independent life.

I thought it might be the worst of all times, given that it would coincide with him starting to form tentative romantic and sexual relationships.

If his own parents — who for a large part of his life, had seemed so loving and happy — could drift apart, what kind of confusing message would that convey to him about the possibility of having a successful marriage as he embarked on an important stage in his life?

New research from The Marriage Foundation — which suggests that half of today’s 20-year-olds will never marry — reminded me of all this. It may have come as a shock to the researchers, but it is no surprise to me. Given that 42 per cent of marriages will end in divorce, my generation — and the generation of 40-somethings behind me — haven’t exactly been good role models.

Growing up in the 50s and 60s, I can’t recall a single divorced couple among my parents’ friends. My own mother and father, who were always companionable and affectionate, were married for 60 years before my dad died. 

Bad example? Linda, who has been divorced twice, with her son Thomas, 26

My assumption then, based on example and expectations within society, was that love led to marriage and that marriage was for eternity. My own brutal awakening was a disastrous first marriage that began when I was 19 and ended six years later when I realised we were incompatible in every way.

Although I was shaken by this break-up, I was still able to look at my parents’ wonderful example of long-lasting love and believe in its possibility. Sadly, my son and his generation have far fewer such examples to hang on to.

Now 26, Thomas is still single and house-sharing with friends. And, as for most of his generation, marriage is currently the last thing on his mind. He doesn’t describe himself or his friends as commitment-phobic, as such, but he does regard himself as one of the ‘wary generation’.

Happier times: Linda with her ex-husband Christian

So many of his pals’ parents are divorced too that he knows, however loving a relationship, it may not last.

On the one hand, it saddens me that his eyes are as wide open to the possibility of failure as they are to success. On the other, I think it’s no bad thing if romantic aspirations are tempered by pragmatism rather than fuelled by fairytales with a ‘happy ever after’.

Last week’s report points to a general decline in marriage and a dramatic fall in the wedded state among those in their 20s. In 1970, the peak year for marriage, 564,818 men and women aged 25 tied the knot. In 2010, just 56,598 did — a 90 per cent drop.

It’s astonishing that there’s been such a shift in so short a time. But today’s 20-somethings are just reacting to what they’ve seen from us parents.

A few years ago, I was editor of a glossy wedding magazine, and we decided to take a stand at a wedding fair. Unlike the other enterprises, selling favours, frocks, flowers and cakes, we had nothing much to offer beyond magazine subscriptions. So we opted to offer emotional support from our agony aunt.

Dozens of girls queued for our stand and most ended up in tears as they talked, fortified with a glass of wine.

The number one stress factor, it turned out, was warring divorced parents and arguments about whether new partners should be invited or banned, who would be allowed to sit at the top table and in a couple of cases whether stepdad or real dad — or mum — should take the bride down the aisle.

Many brides-to-be said it was causing problems with the families and rows with their boyfriends, too, and they were thinking of calling the whole thing off.

9.7 per cent of the adult Welsh population are divorced - that's higher than in Northern Ireland, England or Scotland

No wonder they were reluctant to marry.

Of course, parental divorce is not entirely to blame. The acceptability of sex before marriage has made the teens and 20s a time for freedom, experimentation and fun rather than settling down for life. And girls’ desire for babies is often put on hold until careers have taken off.

Perhaps the biggest stumbling block for 20-somethings is economic. Some 3.3 million youngsters aged between 20 and 34 — nearly a quarter — still live with their parents. They can’t afford to get married, even if they want to.

For those who do manage to set up home with a boyfriend or girlfriend, living together is no longer simply a prelude to marriage, it’s an alternative to it.

Student debt and high house prices mean saving for a deposit, rather than a wedding, is the priority.

When the daughter of a friend rang her mum to say she had exciting news about her and her boyfriend — with whom she had been renting a flat for two years — my friend assumed she was about to announce her engagement.

‘I’m SO SO happy,’ her daughter gushed down the phone. ‘Ben has asked me to buy a flat with him. He’s inherited a bit of money and I’ve saved a few thousand. Isn’t it wonderful?’

Thomas has told Linda that his family still means a lot to him

Marriage wasn’t even mentioned.

That seems to tie in with my son’s thinking. Thomas says marriage is not high on his list of what he believes constitutes commitment.

He explained: ‘Commitment is living together. It’s buying  a home together. Or having a child together. For me a wedding seems more like a big public performance than anything else.’

I can’t reverse the fact I’ve had two divorces. Nor can I undo the effect of those marriage failures on my son. So I’ve tried to mitigate the impact by remaining on civil terms with his dad and not burdening Thomas with our hurts and resentments.

Last Christmas, for example, Thomas was torn between coming to me for a Christmas feast with my sister, her family and close friends, or joining his dad, who was going to be on his own. So I invited his dad to join us, which he did.

Thomas tells me family still means a lot to him. He gets on well with Ron, my partner of the last few years, and Ron’s two daughters.

I make a point of fixing extended family gatherings, and at every opportunity mixing up the generations. Thomas always seems happy to join in.

I’ve told Thomas that Ron has asked me to marry him but I have turned him down, because, although I intend to stay with Ron for the rest of my life, I do not want to make that very public commitment for a third time.

Thomas simply smiled and nodded knowingly, but I think he may be relieved that, having witnessed his parents’  wedding, he doesn’t have to witness another ceremony.

I may not have been a good role model for marriage, but hope I’ve tried to show love and forgiveness.

Whether or not Thomas ultimately marries is a decision for him and any future partner. I’d be lying if I said I wouldn’t shed a tear of happiness to see him walking down the aisle. But, sadly, I have to admit that I’d be a hypocrite if I were ever to suggest it.
