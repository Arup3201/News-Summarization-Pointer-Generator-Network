The man's name hasn't been released but on social media sites - that he has recently deleted - he calls himself DareDevilMagic_Insane.

Police do not believe he's acting alone in his climbing stunts and will not release names of who they believe are involved

Police have said that he's a threat to himself and is a danger to others who might get inspiration to participate in urban exploring after seeing his antics, according to NBC.

'We don't want anyone else doing it. Just imagine a teenager trying to do it,' Officer Kenia Fallat said. 'He's risking his life but what we don't want are others to copy him, and indeed it's not only dangerous but also illegal.'

Though DareDevilMagic_Insane wants to remain mostly anonymous, he has released some information about his climbs to CBS Miami. 

He told the site that his goal with climbing is to share his experiences and views with the world. 

'I want them to feel the vertigo and that heat-racing feel,' he said. 

The climber added that one of his favorite climbs was a shutdown wooden roller coaster in Dania Beach, called The Hurricane.

He did say, however, that the got lots of splinters on that climb. 

Though he's only been filming his adventures for about a month, the free climber has been exploring the sky-high locations for about two years. 

Law-enforcement officers have said that if he or anyone is caught in the act, they will be arrested.  

Frederica Burden, a spokeswoman for the Miami Police Department said in a press release that DareDevilMagic_Insane is committing serious crimes. 

First, to trespass on to a construction site is a third-degree felony in the state of Florida, punishable by up to five year imprisonment and/or fines of up to $10,000 for each violation,' she said. 'Another more important problem is, this behavior may very well lead an impressionable youngster to mimic the climb and risk serious injury or even death.'
