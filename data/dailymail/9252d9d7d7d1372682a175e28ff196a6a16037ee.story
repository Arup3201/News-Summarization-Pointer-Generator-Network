The deportation of radical cleric Abu Qatada took a step closer today, as the Jordanian parliament approved a new treaty with the UK designed to finally kick him out.

Downing Street said David Cameron had not yet booked a plane ticket for Qatada after the deal was sealed to allay fears that evidence extracted through torture will be used against the terror suspect at a retrial.

Last month, Qatada unexpectedly volunteered to leave the country as soon as the treaty between the UK and Jordan is ratified by both countries.

The deportation of radical Islamist cleric Abu Qatada took a step closer after the Jordanian government agreed a treaty with the UK

Home Secretary Theresa May announced in April that she had thrashed out a mutual assistance treaty with Jordan, guaranteeing Qatada the right to a fair trial.

Human rights judges in Britain and Strasbourg had halted his removal to Jordan on the grounds some of the evidence used against him may have been obtained by torture.

The agreement has now been approved by both houses of the Jordanian parliament but must still be signed off by the country's King Abdullah.

The UK Government expects the treaty to be ratified in Britain by June 21.

It does not name Qatada directly, but it states that any evidence used to prosecute someone who is to be deported cannot be used 'unless the prosecution in the receiving State proves beyond any doubt that the statement has been provided out of free-will and choice and was not obtained by torture or ill-treatment by the authorities of the receiving State'.

Home Secretary Theresa May has pinned her hopes on the treaty to finally end the decade-long saga of government attempts to oust him

September 16 1993 - The Jordanian father of five claims asylum when he arrives in Britain on a forged passport.

May 1998 - He applies for indefinite leave to remain in Britain.

April 1999 - He is convicted in his absence on terror charges in Jordan and sentenced to life imprisonment.

February 2001
- He is arrested by anti-terror police over involvement in a plot to 
bomb Strasbourg Christmas market. Officers find him in possession of 
£170,000 in cash, including £805 in an envelope marked 'For the 
mujahedin in Chechnya'.

August 2005 - The preacher is arrested under immigration rules as the Government seeks to deport him to Jordan.

April 2008
- The Court of Appeal rules that deporting him would breach his human 
rights because evidence used against him in Jordan may have been 
obtained through torture.

February 18 2009
- In a landmark judgment, five Law Lords unanimously back the 
Government's policy of removing terror suspects from Britain on the 
basis of assurances from foreign governments. It is ruled he can be 
deported to Jordan to face terror charges.April 18 2012 - Abu Qatada lodges an appeal - potentially delaying his deportation by months.

March
6 2013 - He is returned to jail over fears the terror suspect was 
trying to communicate with associates, in breach of bail conditions.

March 27 2013
- Court of Appeal admits hate preacher is 'very dangerous' but rules 
sending him to face a terror trial in Jordan would not be fair.April 17 2013 - Home Office says it will take its battle to the Supreme Court.

April 23 2013 - Court of Appeal rejects government request to appeal.

Asked whether Mr 
Cameron had booked Qatada's plane ticket to Jordan, a Downing Street 
spokesman said: 'Obviously the announcement 
from Jordan today is good news but from our perspective the case is 
still on-going and the Prime Minister is clear in his determination to 
put Abu Qatada back on a plane to Jordan.'

Ministers have been trying for a decade to send Qatada to Jordan, where he is accused of plotting a terrorist atrocity to coincide with the Millennium.

His removal was originally approved by the British courts, only to be halted by the European Court of Human Rights last year.

Judges in Strasbourg said he would not get a fair trial because some of the evidence used against him may have been obtained by torture. Controversially, Mrs May opted not to appeal against this verdict.

Instead, she and her ministers secured personal promises from the Jordanian authorities there would be no use of torture evidence, and began the deportation process again in the UK legal system.

But last November, the Special Immigration Appeals Commission said it was not satisfied with the assurances, and halted Qatada’s removal. The court said it must reflect the Strasbourg ruling.

That decision was upheld by the Appeal Court and the same court refused permission for the Home Secretary to challenge the ruling in the Supreme Court.

However the treaty with Jordan is seen as a major breakthrough in finally ending the logn and expensive saga.

A Home Office spokesman said: 'The Government remains committed to securing Qatada's deportation as quickly as possible.

'We are pleased the Jordanian parliament has approved the treaty and we await its full ratification by the Jordanian government and the completion of ratification procedures in the UK.'

Qatada is currently behind bars in London's Belmarsh prison after breaching a bail condition which restricts use of mobile phones and other communication devices.

The Special Immigration Appeals Commission (Siac) previously heard that a USB stick understood to belong to Qatada's oldest son contained 'jihadist files' made by the ''media wing of al Qaida'.

Qatada is also being investigated by Scotland Yard over suspected extremist material found during the search of his home.

The Metropolitan Police passed on the material to Danish authorities to reportedly investigate a connection with a controversial Islamic publisher.
