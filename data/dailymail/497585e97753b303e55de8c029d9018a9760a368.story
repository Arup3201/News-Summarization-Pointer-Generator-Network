Chelsea captain John Terry praised the character of his Premier League-title chasing team to bounce back from conceding a two-goal lead to beat Hull and enter the international break on a high.

Draws against Paris St Germain - a result which ended the Blues' Champions League participation - and Southampton may have knocked confidence.

And when Hull came back from going 2-0 down after nine minutes to draw level at 2-2, Chelsea had to dig deep to win 3-2 through Loic Remy's strike.

It leaves Jose Mourinho's men with a six-point lead and a game in-hand on second-placed Manchester City.

'The importance of the win showed on the players' faces and that of the manager afterwards,' Terry said.

'When you set the standard so high as we have done from the word go, then start dropping points at home and go out of the Champions League, once again it comes back down to character.

'It's immense in the dressing room, there is an awful lot of experience in there. It will serve the younger lads well, too.

'It was an important three points going into the international break. For everyone to dwell over that for two weeks was massive.'

Mourinho reflected on a commanding advantage which he hopes will help Chelsea win a first Premier League title since 2010.

'It's the best position since the beginning of the season,' Mourinho, who is chasing a third Premier League title, told Chelsea TV.

'The maximum points (advantage) we had was eight points and when we had eight points we were speaking about 20 matches to go.

'In this moment we have six points (advantage) with one match in hand with 24 possible points for our opponents.

'We know our opponents are there, we know football is very unpredictable, we know that what is happening to us for the last two or three months we cannot control.

'But we also know that we are strong, we are together and we are going to fight to get the points we need to be champions.'

Mourinho was referring to the incidents, such as in the draw with Southampton, which he believes denied his side more points than they earned.

The win at the KC Stadium was Chelsea's third in seven games.

The Blues had followed the Capital One Cup win over Tottenham at Wembley with victory over West Ham, but had been frustrated since.

Now Terry hopes his Chelsea team-mates can return from the international hiatus reinvigorated and ready to carry the momentum from the Hull win by claiming a first home win since February 11 against Everton.

'The title race is exciting,' the former England defender added.

'There is still an awful long way to go. We have Stoke at home and QPR away next, which is always a tough one for us.

'Hopefully everyone will come back fit after the break and go again.

'But it's important we get back to winning at the Bridge because it's something we haven't done for a few weeks.'

Remy was being readied to play alongside Costa at Hull, but had to instead replace the striker, who picked up a hamstring injury.

It was the France striker's fourth goal of a season which has seen him given limited opportunities, mainly off the substitutes' bench.

He told chelseafc.com: 'It is true it is frustrating sitting on the bench but the manager knows all the team and he has very good quality in the squad.

'I know there are only 11 players on the pitch and as soon the manager needs me I am here.

'It's one of my best moments at Chelsea. I hope I will have more moments like that before the end of the season.'
