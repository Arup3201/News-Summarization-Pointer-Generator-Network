Stolen: Thieves are thought to have used a crowbar to prise the historic plaque from the wall of Dore Abbey

A string of medieval monuments stolen from historic country churches are believed to have been targeted by a gang stealing the artefacts to order for wealthy collectors overseas.

The stone effigy of a 13th century bishop is the latest in a series of treasured objects lifted from unlocked churches in Herefordshire and Gloucestershire in recent months - ranging from a medieval grave slab to a carved stone knight dating back 800 years.

The culprits are thought to have used a crowbar to prise open iron clamps fastening the 15in tall plaque - which originally marked the spot where the 13th century bishop of Hereford John de Breton's heart was interred - to the wall of Dore Abbey in Herefordshire.

Churchgoers in the area were left devastated by the loss of the 'irreplaceable treasure', which experts believe was swiped by a gang of thieves that is smuggling the artefacts to other countries - most likely those with different laws surrounding the ownership of stolen property.

In Britain title always reverts to the original owner, but in some countries an object bought in good faith becomes the property of the buyer.

Targeted: Historic Dore Abbey is thought to have been targeted by thieves stealing historic artefacts to sell to collectors overseas

Sally Badham, president of the Church Monuments Society, told The Times she was convinced the monuments were being smuggled abroad.

'My guess is they are being stolen to order,' she said.

'They (the thieves) clearly know what they want and they are clearly going around with intent.'

It is understood that some of the stolen items could fetch many thousands of pounds if they were to be sold legitimately on the open market, but Miss Badham stressed the historic and sentimental value of the missing effigies.

'They are all part of our heritage,' she said.

'We want to pass them on to future generations.'

Hazel Prowse, church warden at Dore Abbey, said of the effigy stolen from the Grade I listed church: 'You can't put a price on it.

'It is irreplaceable.'

In May an 800-year-old carved figure of a medieval knight was wrenched from the windowsill in St Michael's Church, Castle Frome, near Ledbury.

Other historic artefacts targeted by thieves include a medieval grave slab showing a young girl wearing a cloak, and the head and shoulders of a grave effigy of Sir Roger de Wakering from the church he founded at Newland in the Forest of Dean.
