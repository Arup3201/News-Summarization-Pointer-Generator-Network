Violent crime in Britain has fallen by a quarter in the past decade, according to a study.

The UK has experienced a ‘substantial and sustained’ fall in offences ranging from drunken thuggery to murder since 2003, the report suggests.

And official statistics show violent crime is now at its lowest level for 30 years.

The UK Peace Index study, published yesterday, also identifies the villages and towns across the country where crime is at its lowest, and the urban centres where it is still rampant.

Broadland in Norfolk was identified as
 the most peaceful council borough in England and Wales.

It contains 
three market towns and covers part of the Norfolk Broads.

Although it has a population of around
 125,000, only eight violent crimes were recorded in 2012.

The most 
dangerous place to live is Lewisham in South London where more than 400 
violent crimes are carried out every month, and the other boroughs in 
the least peaceful five are also in inner London.

In a comparison of urban areas, 
Glasgow was identified as the city in the UK with the worst crime rate 
followed by London and Belfast.

Glasgow’s murder rate is double the 
national average.

The study was compiled from Home 
Office statistics by the Institute for Economics and Peace, a think 
tank.

It found that the homicide rate – which includes murders and other
 killings – has halved in a decade.

Overall, the violent crime rate was 
down by a quarter, from 1,255 crimes for every 100,000 people a decade 
ago to 933 last year.

Crime in England and Wales fell at a 
faster rate than the European average over that period, with eight in 
ten of local council areas experiencing a drop of at least 10 per cent.

Change: These graphs show how nearly every form of unrest has become less common in most areas of the country, although the red bars show that public disorder has risen in the majority of places

Capital: While London remains more violent than most other areas, as shown by the high violence indicated in the left-hand map, the green areas on the right-hand map shows that the unrest is decreasing

In the UK, the only category of crime to increase sharply over the last decade was drug offences.

The report said changes in police 
practices, an ageing population, a fall in alcohol consumption and the 
introduction of the minimum wage were likely causes.

It also acknowledged a ‘close 
correlation’ between levels of violence and social breakdown, such as 
single parent households and high teenage pregnancy rates.

But the authors dismissed the impact 
of more criminals being locked up.

In the ten years since 2003 the 
prison population has increased by more than 7,000.

Some experts said, however, that the 
report was wrong to dismiss the effect of prison.

Peter Cuthbertson, of 
campaign group the Centre for Crime Prevention, said: ‘Crime is much 
lower than 20 years ago because twice as many criminals are in prison.

‘But the UK is still a high crime 
society and people are right to worry about this.

Trends: Drug offences are the only type of non-violent crime to have become more common since 2003

Variation: Scotland and London are the most dangerous regions, as this map shows, with the South the least

A better police 
presence on the streets has been shown both to cut crime and to improve 
people’s perceptions of crime rates.’

Dr David Green, director of the 
Civitas think tank, said a recession was often linked with lower violent
 crime because people had less money to spend.

This meant alcohol consumption went down with the result that people were less likely to get into fights.

But a recent report revealed that 80 per cent of the public think anti-social behaviour is on the rise.

Statisticians have also accused police
 of exaggerating falls in crime by downgrading crimes. The ONS found 
officers were under ‘informal pressure’ to meet crime reduction targets.

The falls in crime figures in recent years have come despite cuts to police funding and officer numbers.

They have boosted the argument made by
 Home Office ministers that police can find efficiency savings and 
protect the front line while making essential spending cuts.

Homicide: The rate of murder and manslaughter in all areas of the UK is far lower than in the U.S.

Leading the pack: The UK's violent crime rate has been falling faster than the rest of Western Europe

Technology: Advances such as CCTV, DNA profiling and better burglar alarms have helped to deter criminals.

Drinking less: Alcohol consumption has fallen in the past decade, leading to a reduction in street brawls and late-night attacks.

Fewer young people: Demographics are often linked to crime rates as countries with a high youth population tend to be more violent.

Government policy: The introduction of the minimum wage and the raising of the school leaving age kept the poor and the young off the streets.

The internet: One theory suggests that when people are able to communicate globally, they impose stronger taboos on violent crime because they are exposed to the judgement of others.

Ban on lead: Leaded petrol and lead-based paints seem to have affected people's behaviour and made them more likely to commit crimes.

Abortion laws: A controversial study has suggested that the legalisation of abortion in the U.S. helped lower crime rates.

Idyllic: Broadland, in Norfolk, is the most peaceful area in the UK with just eight weapons crimes last year

Contrast: The London borough of Lewisham has been named the most violent place in Britain - its murder rate is two and a half the UK national average

Global scale: Western Europe is extremely peaceful compared to most other regions of the world

Within Europe: The UK has fewer homicides than any other European country except Monaco

The UK Peace Index is based on a combination of five factors - the rate of homicide, violent crime, weapons crime and public disorder, and the number of police officers, all drawn from Home Office statistics.

Homicide and violent crime are given greater weighting in the calculation as they are considered most damaging to the general peace - each makes up 26.7 per cent of the score.

Police numbers account for 20 per cent of the final rating, with weapons crime and public disorder accounting for 13.3 per cent each.

Combining the five measures creates an artificial number between one and five for each region which allows all areas of the UK to be directly compared with each other for their overall levels of violence.

Anyone listening to Radio 4’s Today programme yesterday morning was presented with a long list of possible reasons why crime in the UK is falling.

Among the more credible answers raised were new police technology, the national DNA database and CCTV.

We were also told, more questionably, that it was possible the real reason was the rise of the internet, the removal of lead from petrol and even ‘a new morality’ taking hold across the Western World.

The discussion summarised perfectly what many commentators have always recognised: the Left is desperate to find some reason other than prison to explain why crime is going down.

A barely passing mention was given to what many criminologists regard as the most likely cause of the falling crime rate: the sharp rise in the prison population over the past two decades.

Since the mid-1990s, when Michael Howard instituted his ‘prison works’ policy, the number behind bars in England and Wales has shot up, and remained high.

Then, it stood at just over 40,000. Now it is more than double that and regularly tops 84,000.

At the same time, crime has fallen markedly. The British Crime Survey found it declined by 46 per cent between 1995 and 2008/09.

The authors of yesterday’s report, the little known Institute for Economics and Peace, were dismissive of such a link. But the evidence for ‘prison works’ is compelling.

Take one recent study by academics in the Netherlands, where politicians took a zero-tolerance approach to prolific offenders.

Drug addicts caught repeatedly stealing from homes or cars were jailed for two years instead of the usual community sentence or three months behind bars. On average, each already had more than 30 convictions; some as many as 300.

The results were overwhelming: crime fell by 25 per cent. In cities which locked up the most criminals, it fell by up to 40 per cent.

Like the Netherlands, this country has a small band of repeat offenders. More than 100,000 have at least 15 convictions and the worst repeat offenders are responsible for a third of all crimes.

The other thing missing from yesterday’s discussion was any mention of victims. For them, even short jail sentences work, by giving them relief from their attacker.

What the Left can’t see is obvious to victims of crime: when you lock criminals up for lengthy periods, they can’t do you harm.
