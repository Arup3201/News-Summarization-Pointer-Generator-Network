US President John F Kennedy would have urged Britain to stay within the EU, former foreign secretary David Miliband has claimed.

The ex-Labour MP made the bizarre suggestion in speech to mark the 50th anniversary of the assassination of the former president.

Mr Miliband said he had 'no doubt' that JFK would argue that Britain should stay in the Europe Union and would back David Cameron’s call for a ‘deeper and stronger single market’.

Prediction: David Miliband used his Kennedy Memorial Trust lecture to claim JFK would want Britain to stay in the EU

As the current occupant of the White House, President Barack Obama has warned that America wants ‘a strong UK in a strong EU’.

The transatlantic debate about EU membership was triggered by Mr Cameron’s pledge to negotiate a fresh settlement with Brussels, before holding an in-out referendum by 2017.

Delivering the Kennedy Memorial Lecture last night, Mr Miliband said JFK - a distant relation of former Tory Prime Minister Harold Macmillan - had a ‘deep affection’ for Britain.

Speaking to an invited audience at the British Library, Mr Miliband, said: ‘He saw the assets that Britain brought and should still bring to the European project. I have no doubt he would want us there still.’

Pro-EU: President John F. Kennedy would argue that Eruope is about more than the euro, Mr Miliband claimed

Mr Miliband quit British politics after losing out on the Labour leadership to his brother Ed and is now president of the US-based International Rescue Committee.

He added: ‘Sitting as I now do in New York, there is bafflement at the idea that Britain might leave an institution that costs £1 per week per British citizen - and never mind the indirect benefits the CBI has talked about.

‘It is taken as unhappy proof that we are thinking about opting out of the 21st century.

‘The warnings to Euro-sceptics from political and business leaders could not be clearer: opting out of Europe is your choice, but if you do that then you count yourselves out of the Transatlantic partnership too.

‘The message is simple: be very careful. You may end getting what you want and finding it was not what you wanted after all.’

A Tory-drafted Bill to pave the way for the 2017 referendum is being piloted through Parliament by MP James Wharton, and returns to the Commons this Friday.

But Labour oppose the idea, arguing the call for a referendum at some point in the future creates uncertainty which could undermine investmentin the UK.

During a Q&A session, Mr Miliband added: ‘I'm in the happy position to be able to say I support the Labour party position on this - if there is a fundamental shift in the balance of power between Brussels and Britain then there is an argument for referendum.’

It is vital that there is not a division in Europe between those for and against the Euro, said Mr Miliband.

‘JFK would argue that although the collapse of the euro would be a disaster for Europe, Europe is about so much more than the euro,’ he argued.

Speech: Mr Miliband delivered the speech entitled 'America, Britain & Europe: Lessons from JFK', at the British Library Conference Centre

‘In other words, JFK would surely be strongly opposed to a 'two-tier' Europe and make the case for an expansive European agenda for 28 members of the EU, not just 17, led by a strong European Commission.

‘This means a deeper and stronger single market, consistent with Prime Minister Cameron's speech in January 2013.’

Mr Cameron yesterday warned that British support for remaining in the European Union is now 'wafer thin'.

He said the case had not been made to persuade voters not to sever ties with Brussels in the referendum he has promised by 2017.

Warning: David Cameron told the CBI conference that the case had not yet been made to persuade voters to stay in the European Union

In a speech at the CBI annual conference, Mr Cameron said: 'The current consent for remaining inside the European Union is wafer thin. We haven't made the argument enough about why it matters.

'The argument I have made is not some short-term tactical ploy. It's a long-term strategy for Britain.

'What I've put forward, I believe, has the overwhelming support of the British people and business people too.'
