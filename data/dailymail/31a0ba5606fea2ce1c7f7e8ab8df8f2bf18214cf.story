Harlequins have been in inquest mode this week after their mauling by Saracens, but Chris Robshaw’s reduced role has not been among the items on the agenda.

The England captain is back in the ranks at his club, after the decision was made by director of rugby Conor O’Shea to relieve him of the leadership job, so he could concentrate on his own game in this pre-World Cup season.

Joe Marler has taken over as Quins skipper but it has been a turbulent start to his tenure, with a yellow card in week one of the Aviva Premiership season — a 20-15 win at London Irish — and a 39-0 home defeat against Saracens last Friday.

Robshaw’s removal from a post he had held for four years has met with a mixed response.

One school of thought is that the England captain should be at the sharp end of the decision-making process week after week, in readiness to take on the responsibility at Test level, yet the 28-year-old flanker is happy for Marler to have the arm-band, with all it entails.

However, he does concede that no longer calling the shots has been a culture shock.

‘I have spoken to Joe and he knows I am right behind him,’ Robshaw told Sportsmail yesterday. ‘But of course, on the pitch, I have to remember that I’m not captain now. It is a bit strange not leading the guys out, as I have done for four years at the club.

‘I am always ready to offer advice, whenever it is needed. Even when I watch a game, I am always thinking about what I would do in different situations.

‘I will still have opinions and thoughts, and if I feel strongly about something then I might have a quiet word. But Joe is the one who is making the decisions and I’m just there to back him up.’

Captaincy brings with it a significant additional workload. The enhanced status comes with myriad ambassadorial duties attached, and Robshaw is quite glad to pass those on, in order to spend more time on personal priorities, or just unwinding. ‘I think it has made a difference already,’ he said.

‘I’m not having to do all those extra things that come with being captain, like I was last year, which means you are still busy when everyone else has gone home to relax. It helps when you just want to have a bit of down-time.

‘I remember after the Wales game last year, when we lost, that was one of the hardest defeats of my career, but I had to come straight back to the club, get the club going and help get the players ready for the next game. That had to happen, whatever the hangover was from the previous game.

‘That sort of situation was the reason for this decision. Now it means that I am taken out of that position so I can just focus on myself. Sometimes you just go from big game to big game to big game with your country and your club, so it’s about having that breathing space when you really need it.’

With the World Cup a year away, the fact that Robshaw is no longer acting as club captain has been identified as a potential threat to his leadership of the England team. But he is reassured by the fact that national coach Stuart Lancaster was consulted and endorsed the decision. ‘Myself, Stuart and Conor were all involved in this decision,’ he added.

Last Friday, Robshaw was out-played by his opposite number at Saracens, Will Fraser, who is emerging as a strong challenger for his Test place, along with Gloucester’s Matt Kvesic, if he can return to fitness.

Lancaster has publicly invited these younger opensides to put pressure on his skipper, but the incumbent takes the situation in stride.

‘They always say that it’s tough to earn the shirt, but even tougher to keep the shirt,’ he said. ‘That’s definitely true. There is a lot of competition for that No 7 shirt, but that’s what you want; you want that competition for places to raise standards in all positions. 

‘It means you have to strive to get better and try to raise your game weekly.’
