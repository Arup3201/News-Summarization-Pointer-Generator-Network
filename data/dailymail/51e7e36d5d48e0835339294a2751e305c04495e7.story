It might only be pre season but under Louis van Gaal there is no such thing as a friendly for Manchester United as they take on Real Madrid in their final International Champions Cup group game on Saturday.

The Reds have arrived in Detroit ahead of their clash with the European champions, and Van Gaal is looking forward to a game where he feels his new charges can best show their qualities.

'We played against AS Roma, who were second in the Italian league, then against Inter Milan, who were fifth in the Italian league,' the new boss told ManUtd.com.

Arriving in style: Louis van Gaal and Juan Mata take their first steps on Detroit soil after a short flight

Cheeky chaps: Juan Mata and Javier Hernandez attend a signing session on their latest tour stop

Showing off: Wayne Rooney follows Wilfried Zaah into the General Motors HQ on a publicity visit

Having a laugh: Chris Smalling, Nani, De Gea, Danny Welbeck and Ashley Young enjoy themselves before the serious business of their match with Real Madrid begins

Popular: Javier Hernandez signs autographs at the airport after jumping off the Reds' plane from Maryland

Tears of joy: Welbeck evidently had something on his phone that Young found funny in Detroit

'Now we play Real Madrid and it is nice to play against such teams, so you can show you are at least equal.'

United went on to visit the General Motors HQ in Detroit after leaving the airport, showing off their new Chevrolet-sponsored shirts at a session with fans - 109,000 of whom will be watching on when they face Real. 

A win or draw would see the Reds advance to a potential final showdown with Manchester City in Florida's Sun Life Stadium.

And that would give the former Holland manager an even better opportunity to check out the qualities of his players ahead of next season, with the Premier League champions acting as the perfect benchmark. 

Speedy: Fletcher, De Gea and Rooney pose with a car in their new shirts for the new season

Squad: It was a testing afternoon of promotional commitments for Van Gaal's charges

Entourage: David de Gea led the players off the plane while Darren Fletcher and Wayne Rooney also made it off

Posers: The Reds, all in club suits and ties, strike a pose in Detroit after their arrival

Bringing up the rear: Ryan Giggs climbs down the stairs while Hernandez and Phil Jones lug their bags off
