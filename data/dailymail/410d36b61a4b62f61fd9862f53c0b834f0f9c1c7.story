A sunspot 62,000 miles across - ten times bigger than Earth - is releasing gigantic solar flares that have created astonishing light shows over Britain, described by one sky-watcher as the best he'd ever seen.

Known as auroras, they are caused by radiation particles 
from the sun bouncing off Earth's atmosphere and are normally only seen in countries in the far north, such as Norway.

However, they've been photographed  as far south as Oxfordshire and in Northumberland, where the skies became a dramatic green and purple hue.

A huge green and red aurora was also captured by the International Space Station.

However, the recent solar flares, caused by a 
sunspot known as 'Active Region 1302', could wreak havoc with electrical
communications ranging from handheld 
electronics such as iPhones to sections of the power grid.

But experts 
believe the most powerful eruptions have been and gone.

Joe Kunches, a scientist at NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center in Boulder, Colorado, said: 'The solar wind that was really energised seems to have passed us by.'

However, solar activity is notoriously unpredictable and the Earth isn't out of the firing line just yet.

Astronomer
Dr Ian Griffin, CEO of Science Oxford, told MailOnline: ‘Active Region 
1302 is the source of all of the auroras, and may well be the source of 
some more auroras over the next few nights.

‘Space-weather 
forecasters estimate a 40 per cent chance of more flares during the 
next 24 hours. Any such eruptions would be Earth-directed as the sunspot
crosses the centre of the solar disk.

‘In short, with no moon in the sky, and 
an active region on the sun, the next few nights might be very 
interesting for sky-watchers in Britain.’

Aurora-chaser Reed Ingram-Weir described the lights seen over Britain as the most impressive he'd ever seen.

On
Monday he took incredible pictures near the causeway that links the 
North East coast with the island of Lindisfarne, in Northumberland.

He
said: 'What made this display really amazing was the colour, it was a 
fantastic deep purple colour when usually Northern Lights are a pale 
green colour.

'The reason 
it was purple is all to do with the composition of the particles from 
the sun hitting the atmosphere, obviously these were some different 
kinds of particles.

Red alert: This stunning image from the International Space Station shows a bright green and red aurora over the Earth, with the latter colour caused by radiation colliding with nitrogen in the atmosphere

Hot stuff: The behemoth sunspot 1302 has been unleashing huge solar flares

Well spotted: Astronomer Dr Ian Griffin took this picture of Active Region 1302 in Oxford

'We set off from Newcastle at around 9pm and then drove an hour north, all the time trying to get a clear view directly north.

'We needed to find an area without 
light pollution as well and by the time we reached Lindisfarne it was 
about 10.30pm but it was well worth the journey.

'I have been to Norway four times and Iceland once to see the lights, but this was the best one I have ever seen anywhere.'

Spectacular auroras could be a fairly regular occurrence over the next new years as the sun is currently going through a strong period of activity.

Dr Tim O'Brien from the University of Manchester's Jodrell Bank Observatory, told MailOnline: 'Solar activity rises and falls, with peaks every 11 years. We are now on a rise towards the next maximum, which is good news for Northern Light watchers.

'The next peak is in 2014, so there should be other chances to see auroras. The rate of occurence (of solar flares) will certainly increase over the next few years. However, you can't predict them.'

A sunspot occurs when strong magnetic fields on the sun reach the surface and cool down, according to Nasa. Large ones can be seen clearly using telescopes and powerful cameras.
