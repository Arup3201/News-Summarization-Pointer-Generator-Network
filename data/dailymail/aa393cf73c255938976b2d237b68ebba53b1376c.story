A judge has forced a 58-year-old man to stand outside a police station wearing a sign referring to himself as an 'idiot' for calling 911 and threatening to kill officers.

Richard Dameron will be wearing the large yellow sign with black lettering for three hours every day this week as he stands outside the Second District police station in Cleveland, Ohio.

The sign reads: 'I was being an idiot calling 911 and threatening to kill you. Iâ€™m sorry and it will never happen again.'

Shamed: Richard Dameron has been forced to wear a sign calling himself an idiot for threatening police

The punishment was handed out by Cleveland Municipal Court Judge Pinkey Carr.

The apology was directed at former 'super cop' Jim Simone, a retired officer who was shot twice in his career, including once to the head.

Police said Dameron threatened to kill his son's girlfriend and Officer Simone in February.

Speaking outside the police station with the sign around his neck, Dameron expressed his remorse.

Regrets: He apologized for threatening a retired officer and said he was drunk and acted like 'a fool'

'I stand up and be a man and do what I've gotta do and get it over with,' he told WEWS. 'I apologize to officer Simone 
and all the other officers. I get drunk a lot of times and I make a fool
out of myself.'

He added to WKYC: 'I was under the influence of alcohol, 
very deeply into it. We just got to rambling off, 
acting like fools... I do feel bad about it, cause the man's never done 
nothing to me.'

The judge handed out a similar punishment to a woman who drove around a schoolbus last year.

Shena Hardin, 32, was ordered to stand at an intersection on two mornings wearing a sign that said: 'Only an idiot drives on the sidewalk to avoid a school bus.'

Long wait: He has to wear the sign for three hours every morning outside the police station this week

Cleveland Metropolitan School District bus driver Uriah Herron had captured video of Hardin driving on the sidewalk so that she wouldn't have to stop to wait for the children to get on and off the bus.

Hardin had pleaded not guilty to the charges at a court hearing but later changed her plea.
