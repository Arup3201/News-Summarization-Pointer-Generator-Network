Premier League teams envied Milan's giants. Now Italians are poor relations 

Louis van Gaal now knows what it is like to be an English manager. He is suffering from the same issue that affects his contemporaries from these shores: familiarity. Breeds contempt, you know.

That’s why whenever an English-born manager’s name is put forward for a job, the phone-ins and message boards come alight and folk armed with a hundred negatives discuss the candidate’s uselessness. A foreign name, not so much.

A poll in the Newcastle Chronicle on Tuesday suggested 97 per cent of Newcastle United fans would be happy if Frank de Boer got the job.

That’s a bad result for Steve McClaren. Yet McClaren was well regarded at Manchester United by Sir Alex Ferguson, won a trophy and got Middlesbrough to a European final, won the league in Holland and is doing an excellent job at Derby County. He is clearly a talented coach.

The problem is we know too much. We know that he failed to get England to the European Championships in 2008, that Middlesbrough’s UEFA Cup run had more than an air of good fortune, and that he lost a play-off final with Derby last May. We know every flaw and mis-step.

It is not the same with De Boer. The odd Dutch football obsessive aside, what we know is what we read: a record four consecutive Eredivisie titles with Ajax.

And that is impressive. But it’s a line in a c.v. We do not have intimate knowledge of De Boer’s career. We might catch Ajax in the odd Champions League tie, or on a highlights package, but we do not know every nuance or twist in the plot.

Did Ajax have more money to spend than their rivals? Were they already well set up when De Boer inherited the team? Did other teams have complications, injuries or money issues? And why are Ajax now trailing PSV Eindhoven by six points?

For all we know, McClaren’s title win at FC Twente may be regarded as a greater achievement than a manager claiming another prize for mighty Ajax. No English manager will ever get a 97 per cent approval rating coming into a job because we have familiarity, and Van Gaal is suffering from that now.

Former England manager Steve McClaren led unfashionable FC Twente to the Dutch title back in 2010

He arrived at Manchester United as a genius because of his work at Ajax, Barcelona and Bayern Munich — some of the greatest clubs in the world. Yet we only have half an eye on those games — we hear Van Gaal is top of the league again and the excellence of his performance is presumed.

We thought the same of Pep Guardiola at Bayern Munich last season — right up until the moment his team were swept aside by Real Madrid.

That one tie didn’t make Guardiola a failure — but it did demonstrate that no manager stands up to incessant scrutiny. Not even the very best.

Now we are watching every minute of every game, it turns out Van Gaal is human, too. His team can’t break down Cambridge United away; his defence is unconvincing; he is not getting the best out of Radamel Falcao and Angel di Maria’s first season is inconsistent; occasionally, of late, his record has been compared questioningly with that of David Moyes.

A British manager would be under siege by now — with every past mistake and failing exhumed and examined for clues.

When Moyes took over from Ferguson, he did so dragging a whole heap of baggage. We knew he had never won a trophy, or managed beyond the qualifying round of the Champions League. We knew his Everton teams had a reputation for caution and that he was not renowned for his decisiveness in the transfer market.

So when the odd flaw appeared, it was instantly seized upon, the critics armed with a filing cabinet of prior knowledge.

At Real Sociedad, Moyes has the benefit of being the foreign coach. Few will have studied Everton’s games, or even seen much of what went on at Manchester United.

They will have been sold a c.v. that showed Everton as perennial relegation candidates when he took over, and as a strong, established club near the top of the table when he left. They won’t have all the footnotes and clarification available to an English football fan.

Go back to 2000 and Sven Goran Eriksson was hailed as a master tactician, on the back of his record at Sampdoria and Benfica. It turned out he liked the ball chased into the channels and was as married to 4-4-2 as any son of Barnsley.

Would he get the same offer now? No, because we know him. We’ve seen that he fell short with a gifted group at the 2004 European Championship, we’ve witnessed his subsequent work at Manchester City, Leicester City and Notts County. He’s not a mystery any more.

Neither is Pepe Mel, nor Felix Magath. They all flew in, though, with reputations far in advance of their English counterparts, and levels of indulgence that would never be afforded a local.

The record suggests Van Gaal will get it right at United. De Boer would no doubt make a very good manager of Newcastle, too. But so, quite probably, would McClaren — yet while one has an approval rating of 97 per cent, the other barely registers.

There cannot be so many Chronicle readers with inside knowledge of Ajax; but plenty of us are willing to take the same test on Hull City, Crystal Palace or Derby.

We know about the managers at those clubs. They’re useless.
