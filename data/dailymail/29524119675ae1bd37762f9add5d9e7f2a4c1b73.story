It's the week where London is awash with the great and the good of the fashion world.

A-listers sitting on the FROW (front row), gazing at the impossibly beautiful slink down the catwalk in costly creations, London Fashion Week brings with it a palpable air of excitement and glamour. 

And the capital's bars and restaurants want a piece of the action too, devising fashion-themed cocktails to slake the thirst of the fashion elite who have descended on the city. 

Mixologists and bartenders have gone all out to create fashion inspired cocktails for London Fashion Week

From the gin-based Choupette, inspired by designer Karl Lagerfeld's cat to the Viviennita, which pays homage to iconic British fashion designer Dame Vivienne Westwood, here are the ten best fashioned-themed cocktails on offer in the capital this London Fashion Week.

'London Fashion Week has been the perfect opportunity to develop a selection of dedicated cocktails to celebrate an exciting time of year in the capital, said Bala Ramasamy, Manager of TwoRuba Bar in Hilton London Tower Bridge. 

The bar has four fashioned themed cocktails on offer: Savage Beauty, inspired by Alexander McQueen, Ruba Rouge, Brr Berry and Golden Goddess.

'We've had a lot of fun with this campaign, getting the flavours just right and making sure the presentation is eye-catching – we feel we have created the perfect homage to some of the world's most famous fashion houses,' he continued. 

Jeremy Pascal Bar Manager Sixtyone which created Spring Collection, Viviennita and Choupette, said: 'With Sixtyone restaurant and bar so close to all of the London Fashion Week action we thought it would be a great idea to come up with three cocktails inspired by fashion and famous designers. 

'Take for example our Viviennita named after the amazing Dame Vivienne Westwood. This lively, bright orange concoction containing fresh carrot and Tequila Olmeca Blanco is served in an elegant coupette glass and is very refreshing and revitalising - perfect for sipping on after a long day at the fashion shows.'
