Global warming is rapidly turning America the beautiful into America the stormy, sneezy and dangerous, according to a new federal scientific report. And those shining seas? Rising and costly, the report says.

Climate change's assorted harms 'are expected to become increasingly disruptive across the nation throughout this century and beyond,' concludes the 2014 National Climate Assessment released on Tuesday.

The report emphasizes how warming and its all-too-wild weather are changing daily lives, even using the phrase 'climate disruption' as another way of saying global warming.

Still, it's not too late to prevent the worst of climate change, says the 840-page report, which the White House is highlighting as it tries to jump-start often stalled efforts to curb heat-trapping gases.

Global warming is rapidly turning America the beautiful into America the stormy, sneezy and dangerous, according to a new federal scientific report. Since January 2010, 43 of the lower 48 states have set at least one monthly record for heat. California had its warmest January on record this year.

Black line: Observed global average changes. Green area: model simulations using only changes in natural factors (solar and volcanic). Blue area: model simulations with the addition of human-induced emissions. 

Climate changes since 1950 cannot be explained by natural factors or variability, and can only be explained by human factors, the report says.

However, if the nation and the world don't change the way they use energy, 'we're still on the pathway to more damage and danger of the type that are described in great detail in the rest of this report,' said study co-author Henry Jacoby, co-director of the Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Jacoby, other scientists and White House officials said this is the most detailed and U.S.-focused scientific report on global warming.

'Climate change, once considered an issue for a distant future, has moved firmly into the present,' the report says. 'Corn producers in Iowa, oyster growers in Washington state and maple syrup producers in Vermont are all observing climate-related changes that are outside of recent experience.'

The report looks at regional and state-level effects of global warming, compared with recent reports from the United Nations that lumped all of North America together. 

The map on the left shows a projected change in average annual temperature over the period 2071-2099 (compared to the period 1970-1999) under a scenario that assumes rapid reductions in emissions and concentrations of heat-trapping gases (RCP 2.6). The map on the right assumes continued increases in emissions (RCP 8.5).

The colors on the map show temperature changes throughout the past 22 years (1991-2012) compared to the 1901-1960 average, and compared to the 1951-1980 average for Alaska and Hawaii. The bars on the graphs show the average temperature changes by decade for 1901-2012 (relative to the 1901-1960 average) for each region. The far right bar in each graph (2000s decade) includes 2011 and 2012. The period from 2001 to 2012 was warmer than any previous decade in every region.

The map on the left shows the projected change in average temperature under a scenario that assumes substantial reductions in heat trapping gases (B11). The map on the right assumes continued increases in global emissions (A2)

A draft of the report was released in January 2013, but this version has been reviewed by more scientists, the National Academy of Science and 13 government agencies and more than 4,000 public comments.

It is written in a bit more simple language so people could realize 'that there's a new source of risk in their lives,' said study lead author Gary Yohe of Wesleyan University in Connecticut.

The advisory committee responsible for the report - which includes representatives from 13 U.S. departments and agencies, academics, businesses and non-profits- released similar reports assessing the global climate in 2000 and 2009.

Even though the nation's average temperature has risen by as much as 1.9 degrees since record keeping began in 1895, it's in the big, wild weather where the average person feels climate change the most, said co-author Katharine Hayhoe, a Texas Tech University climate scientist.

Extreme weather like droughts, storms and heat waves hit us in the pocketbooks and can be seen by our own eyes, she said.

And it's happening a lot more often lately.

The map shows percent increases in the amount of precipitation falling in very heavy events (defined as the heaviest 1% of all daily events) from 1958 to 2012 for each region of the continental United States. These trends are larger than natural variations for the Northeast, Midwest, Puerto Rico, Southeast, Great Plains, and Alaska. The trends are not larger than natural variations for the Southwest, Hawaii, and the Northwest.

The report says the intensity, 
frequency and duration of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes have 
increased since the early 1980s, but it is still uncertain how much of 
that is from man-made warming.

Winter
 storms have increased in frequency and intensity and shifted northward 
since the 1950s, it says.

Also, heavy downpours are increasing — by 71 
percent in the Northeast. Experts expect the number of times it rains to go down, but the intensity of downpours to go up. Especially at risk in this region are the approximately 1.6 million people who live within the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) 100-year coastal flood zone, the majority of whom live in  New York and New Jersey.

Heat waves, such as those in Texas in 
2011 and the Midwest in 2012, are projected to intensify nationwide. 
Droughts in the West and Southwest are expected to get stronger. The combination of the two are contributing the dryness that precedes raging wildfires.

The report concludes that heat waves are 'largely a natural phenomenon,' but the increase in severity is 'likely due to human activity, with a detectable human influence in recent heat waves in the southern Great Plains, as well as in Europe, and Russia.'

Human contributions to climate change 'approximately doubled the probability' Texas would experience record-breaking heat.

In January 2013, none of California was in either extreme or exceptional drought; now nearly 77 percent of the state is.This year California had its warmest January on record.

Since January 
2010, 43 of the lower 48 states have set at least one monthly record for
 heat, 

Nineteen different state records were broke in the last year alone,  according to an Associated Press analysis of federal weather 
records.

Six were for heat: 
Arizona, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and 
California.Nine states set monthly records for being too wet: Iowa 
(twice, setting records for April and May last year), Georgia, Michigan,
 New Jersey, Florida, Colorado, Oregon and Washington. Two states set 
records for lack of rain: New Mexico and Utah. Two set records for 
coldest individual months: Maine and North Dakota.

'We're being hit 
hard,' Hayhoe said, comparing America to a boxer. 'We're holding steady,
 and we're getting hit in the jaw. We're starting to recover from one 
punch, and another punch comes.'

The report also says 'climate change threatens human health and well-being in many ways.'

Those include smoke-filled air from more wildfires, smoggy air from 
pollution, more diseases from tainted food, water, mosquitoes and ticks.

And then there's more 
pollen because of warming weather and the effects of carbon dioxide on 
plants. Ragweed pollen season has lengthened by 24 days in the 
Minnesota-North Dakota region between 1995 and 2011, the report says. In
 other parts of the Midwest, the pollen season has gotten longer by 
anywhere from 11 days to 20 days.

Sea level has 
risen 8 inches since 1880 and is projected to rise between 1 foot and 4 
feet by 2100.

Authors of the report worry that the Arctic Sea, which borders Alaska, Canada and Russia, could permanently become nearly ice free during the summer.

Even if humans completely ended harmful emissions, temperatures are predicted to rise by 0.5°F throughout the next several decades, not withstanding unpredictable natural disasters that could affect the global climate.

At the current rate of human activity, temperatures will rise 2- 4°F throughout the same period of time.

And all this will come with a hefty cost, the report says.

Flooding alone may cost $325 billion 
by the year 2100 in one of the worst-case scenarios, with $130 billion 
of that in Florida, the report says.

Already the droughts and heat waves of 2011 and 2012 added about $10 billion to farm costs, the report says.

Warning: The report claims that extreme weather events like Hurricane Sandy have and will become more common

Billion-dollar
 weather disasters have hit everywhere across the nation, but have hit 
Texas, Oklahoma and the Southeast most often, the report says.

Of the more expensive weather events was the October 29, 2012 Superstorm Sandy.

'The resultant direct costs to the community and indirect costs to the economy will undoubtedly rise into the tens of billions of dollars,' the report says of the storm.

The White House plans to use the long report as 
scientific justification to reduce emissions of heat-trapping gas from 
the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, gas and oil and to encourage 
local communities to adapt to changes in the climate, as outlined in President Barack Obama's 2013 Climate Action Plan.

Republicans are not fans of Obama's plan. They have dubbed the White House's clean energy push a 'war on coal.'

They’ll find various ways, particularly in the House, to try to stop us
 from using the authority we have under the Clean Air Act. All I would 
say is that those have zero percent chance of working. We’re committed 
to moving forward with those rules,' White House counselor John Podesta told reporters on Monday during the White House press briefing.

House Republicans are currently trying to pass legislation that would stop the Environmental Protection agency from regulating greenhouse gas emissions. The new rules are scheduled to be unveiled next month, and Podesta said on Monday that the EPA is on track to meet that deadline.
