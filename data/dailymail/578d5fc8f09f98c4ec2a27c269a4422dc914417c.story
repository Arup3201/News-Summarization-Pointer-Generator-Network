The FBI has made an arrest as part of its phone hacking investigation weeks after nude photos of Scarlett Johansson were leaked

The FBI has made an arrest as part of its phone hacking investigation weeks after nude photos of Scarlett Johansson leaked.

A Florida man was charged with 
hacking into the emails of Christina Aguilera, Johansson and 
Mila Kunis in a computer invasion scheme that targeted Hollywood 
celebrities, federal authorities said Wednesday.

Christopher Chaney, 35, of 
Jacksonville was arrested without incident as part of a yearlong 
investigation of celebrity hacking that was dubbed 'Operation 
Hackerazzi.' Chaney, who was expected to appear in a Florida courtroom 
later Wednesday, was charged with 26 counts of identity theft, 
unauthorized access to a protected computer and wiretapping.

If convicted, he faces up to 121 years in prison. It wasn't immediately known if he had retained an attorney.

Authorities said Chaney was 
responsible for stealing nude photos taken by Johansson herself and were
later posted on the Internet. Chaney offered some material to celebrity
blog sites but there is no evidence that he profited from his scheme, 
said Steven Martinez, assistant director in charge of the FBI's Los 
Angeles office.

'Celebrity information is highly 
marketable,' said Martinez, who added his office continues to receive 
complaints about celebrities' having their personal information 
breached.

There were more than 50 victims, 
including Kunis, Aguilera and actress Renee Olstead. 

Others were named 
only by initials and investigators wouldn't identify if they were 
famous, but said those who were named as victims in the indictment 
agreed to have the identities made public.

U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California Andre Birotte Jr answered questions after announcing the arrest of Christopher Chaney, 35, of Jacksonville, Florida, in Operation Hackerazzi

At a press conference on Wednesday the FBI showed how the celebrities, more 50 in total and many still anonymous, were hacked in six steps

'It helps get out the message that 
cyber-hacking is a real threat,' said U.S. Attorney Andre Birotte, who 
called those who engage in such activity as 'scum.'

Chaney hacked Google, Apple and Yahoo
email accounts beginning last November through February, then hijacked 
the forwarding feature so that a copy of every email received was sent, 
'virtually instantaneously,' to an email account he controlled, 
according to an indictment handed up Tuesday by a federal grand jury in 
Los Angeles.

He allegedly used the hacker names 
'trainreqsuckswhat,' ''anonygrrl' and 'jaxjaguars911,' and also used the
victims' identities to illegally access and control computers.

Celebrities who agreed to be named in the indictment included Mila Kunis, Christina Aguilera and lesser known actress Renee Olstead, who has a role on TV show The Secret Life of the American Teenager

Chaney 
is accused of damaging email servers that caused losses of at least 
$5,000 per instance.

Authorities wouldn't say whether 
Chaney was able to access email accounts via cell phones, but he was 
able to figure out secure passwords to various celebrity accounts 
through information that had been made public.

A message seeking comment was left on
an answering machine for a Christopher Chaney in Jacksonville. There 
was no answer at a telephone listing for another Christopher Chaney.

Celebrities and people in the news have long been targets of privacy invasion but concerns have redoubled in the Internet age.

Rupert Murdoch, who closed the News of the World over hacking, giving evidence to the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee on the News of the World phone-hacking scandal in July

In Britain, publisher Rupert Murdoch 
closed down the News of the World this year after contentions that the 
tabloid routinely hacked into people's phones in the hunt for exclusive 
stories.

The paper, which had published for 
168 years, faced allegations of systematically intercepting private 
voicemail of those in the news — including a teenage murder victim.

Investigators said they hoped the 
celebrity-infused case will jumpstart those who don't value online 
security enough to protect their personal information and create more 
secure passwords that can't be easily figured out by would-be hackers.

'Taking these steps will go a long 
way in protecting yourself from the financial and emotional costs of 
having someone intrude on your private life and potentially steal your 
identity,' Birotte said.
