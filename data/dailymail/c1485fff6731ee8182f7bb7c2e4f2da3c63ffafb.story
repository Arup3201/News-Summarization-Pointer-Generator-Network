Bacteria that eats radioactive waste has been discovered in the Peak District - and could now be used to help 'eat away' at nuclear waste.

Scientists at the University of Manchester say they have found 'extremophile' bacteria that can survive the harsh conditions of underground radioactive waste disposal sites.

The findings, published in the ISME (Multidisciplinary Journal of Microbial Ecology) journal, say the tiny waste-eating single-cell organisms could help with Britain's growing problem of nuclear waste disposal.

It is the first time that scientists - who discovered the bacteria in contaminated soil in an old lime kiln - have found microbes like it.

Britain currently has enough waste to fill four Albert Halls and how it is disposed of is a growing problem.

Huge amounts of waste will be encased in concrete before being stored in underground vaults for thousands of years.

But when surface water eventually reaches the waste, it will react with the cement and become highly alkaline.

This triggers chemical reactions that create isosaccharinic acid (ISA), which can react with the toxic elements which make up the radioactive component of nuclear waste.

If the acid binds to radionuclides, such as uranium, then the radionuclides becomes soluble. It means it is more likely to flow out of the vaults, potentially seeping into drinking water and into the food chain.

But researchers say these microbes can use the ISA as a source of food  under conditions that mimic those expected in disposal sites.

For example, when there is no oxygen to help these bacteria break down the ISA, the microorganisms are able to breathe using other chemicals in the water, such as nitrate or iron.

Professor Jonathan Lloyd of university's School of Earth, Atmospheric & Environmental Sciences said: 'We are very interested in these Peak District microorganisms.

'Given that they must have evolved to thrive at the highly alkaline lime-kiln site in only a few decades, it is highly likely that similar bacteria will behave in the same way and adapt to living off ISA in and around buried cement-based nuclear waste quite quickly.

'Nuclear waste will be remain buried deep underground for many thousands of years so there is plenty of time for the bacteria to become adapted.

'Our next step will be to see what impact they have on radioactive materials. We expect them to help keep radioactive materials fixed underground through their unusual dietary habits, and their ability to naturally degrade ISA.'

The next step is to study the processes used to support life in the extreme conditions and to see what effect the bacteria has on radioactive waste.
