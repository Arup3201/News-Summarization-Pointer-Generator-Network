Standing tall over sprawling Belgian fields, this looming structure once housed Nazi soldiers who surveyed the surrounding landscape from the vantage point of the 100ft watchtower.

Now the 74-year-old building has been given a new lease of life after being transformed into a luxurious contemporary home spread over six floors, featuring striking circular rooms, lift access, and a magnificent terrace to take advantage of its panoramic views over the Flemish countryside.

While the exterior of the building has changed little since the days of Nazi rule, the interior has been stripped out to make way for a stunning high-spec kitchen, an enormous living area boasting 360 degree views, and a vast bathroom that occupies an entire floor of the tower on the outskirts of the village of Steenokkerzeel.

Looming: The 100ft tall structure was used as a watchtower by the Nazis during World War II

New lease of life: The former Nazi watchtower has been transformed into a luxury home

Contemporary: The spacious home is split over six floors and boasts elevator access

Transformation: This giant cylinder - now used as a unique chalkboard - was part of the original structure of the tower

In 2008 architects from Belgian design studio Bham gutted the interior of the tower, leaving just the concrete skeleton behind. The building was then split into six floors and an elevator installed to whisk occupants between the newly-installed master bedroom, kitchen, living and dining areas.

Keeping in mind the building's original purpose, the top floor of the luxury 4,844 sq ft abode - named Chateau D'Eau - has been turned into a terrace boasting views stretching miles over the surrounding countryside.

Dramatic: A spiral staircase dominates the minimalist master bedroom

Vast: The main bathroom occupies the entire third floor of the tower

Palatial: The huge bathroom boasts his and hers sinks and a sofa for lounging around in

Centrepiece: The almost 15ft tall shower forms the centrepiece to the enormous bathroom

Level five houses the living area, including a vast contemporary kitchen, while the whole of level four has been devoted to the spacious master bedroom.

The third floor has been given over entirely to the main bathroom, in which a near 15ft high shower has been installed as a dramatic centrepiece.

A guest area incorporating a bedroom and bathroom takes up the second floor, while level one is home to storage and utility rooms. On the ground floor is a garage with space for two cars.

Original elements including the main water conduct, concrete ceilings and staircases, and a giant 250,000 litre water basin were kept to preserve the strong identity of the building.

The tower was originally built in 1938, and co-opted by the Nazis during World War II who used it as a vantage point from which to monitor the surrounding area.

The building was used as a water tower up until the 1990s, and was declared a war monument in 2004.

It is owned by a couple who rent parts of their unique home out for exclusive events.
