A student in Connecticut drowned at his high school's pool after he lay on the bottom for 17 minutes while his classmates splashed and swam above him.

Malvrick Donkor, 14, slipped below the water during a swimming class at Manchester High School on Wednesday. Surveillance video reportedly shows no splashing or struggling to swim.

He was only found after other students began to leave the pool after class ended and spotted him at the bottom of the deep end.

Tragic: No one noticed that Malvrick Donkor was drowning for 17 minutes - until students started to get out of the pool when class ended

'There's no splashing, no flailing like you would typically think of,' a source who watched the CCTV tape told the Hartford Courant. 'He just slipped under water. Other kids were swimming over the top of him, not knowing he was down below.'

It is unknown how many adults were supervising the students and how the lifeguards never spotted Malvrick drowning.

The swimming teacher, Thayer Redman, has been suspended with pay, though the school district won't comment on whether they are investigating the teacher for misconduct.Â 

Mr Redman is the boy's track and field 
coach at Manchester High School and was one of eight finalists for the 
National Coach of the Year in 2011.

Consequences: The pool at Manchester High School is closed and swim classes have been canceled 'indefinitely' as administrators try to figure out how no one saw the student drowning

Suspended: Thayer Redman, the swimming teacher, has been put on administrative leave with pay. He is a well-respected track and field coach

The pool has been closed and swimming classes have been suspended indefinitely.

Hundreds of students, parents and teachers turned out at the school for a memorial service to member Malvrick on Monday.

'While we all want to better understand what happened, our focus at this time is on helping all members of the school community through this huge loss,' principal Matthew Geary wrote in a letter to parents.

The student's family, who is from Ghana, has hired a lawyer and is reportedly preparing to sue the school district.

Malvrick is the second student to drown in Connecticut this year. In January, Marcum Asiamah, 15, drowned during a supervised swimming class at East Hartford High School, according to the Courant.
