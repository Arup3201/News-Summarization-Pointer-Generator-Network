The extreme cold combined with high winds made it particularly difficult for firefighters to contain the blaze when it broke out around 4.45am Monday morning in the building, which houses doctors' offices and other medical facilities.

No one was hurt in the fire, and now the race is on for the fire marshal to conduct an investigation of what started the inferno.

'The ice that's put on this property adds a lot of weight and we establish collapse zones and we just have to stay out of it's way,'  Philadelphia Fire Department Deputy Chief James Bonner told NBC 10. 

'We have to keep it contained to the building it's in and make sure the building doesn't fall on us.'

No one was injured or hurt in the fire, which rages for two hours

The building houses doctor offices and other medical facilities

One driver's car froze over completely, giving her no access to the vehicle

Once the investigation is complete, the owner of the building has decided that demolish the structure.

Meanwhile, those cars and structures close to the medical center are also dealing with their own problems.
