Sparks are virtually guaranteed to fly in an explosive Anglo-Scottish grudge match in the badminton mixed doubles semi-final on Saturday when England’s Chris Adcock, 25, and wife Gabby, 23, take on Scotland’s Robert Blair, 32, and Imogen Bankier, 26, against a backdrop of bitter past rivalry.

Both of the men involved have previously played mixed doubles with each of the women they oppose on Saturday but Adcock and Bankier’s former alliance was a source of particular negativity in the run-up to the London Olympics.

Adcock, 25, was romantically involved with then-girlfriend Gabby (nee White) at that time, but it was deemed Gabby was not good enough on the court to partner him at London 2012.

Rivals: Scots Robert Blair (left) and Imogen Bankier (right) will contest the mixed doubles semi-final

Hence she was ‘dumped’, in a sporting sense, and replaced by Bankier.

Bankier was on the end of all manner of insults. White called her ‘sour’ via Twitter. White’s close friend and fellow player Jenny Wallwork also used the social network to brand Bankier a ‘cripple’ who should ‘jog on back to Scotland.’

One insider said at the time: ‘It got to a point where Chris and Gabby were not really progressing (on court) — so Chris was paired up with Imogen.’

The verbal spats were partially cleared with ‘it was banter’ apologies. But the situation hardly improved as Adcock and Bankier flopped at London 2012, losing all three group matches to crash out at the first hurdle. White did not even play at the Games. Bankier had been brought into the Badminton England set-up, which controls Team GB badminton, to play with Adcock but then quit to return to Scotland.

Blair and Bankier reached today’s semi-final with a 21-11, 21-17 win over Canada’s Derrick Ng and Phyllis Chan.

The Adcocks, who married last year, won 21-13, 21-14 against Singapore’s Lei Yao and Chayut Triyachart.

Blair, who knows Gabby Adcock through a time playing mixed together, said last night: ‘I think when you come into tight situations there are a lot of emotions, and sometimes personal emotions come into it as well.

‘People can get quite carried away or excited, and maybe not fight enough, but we are all experienced players now. I am sure we can all deal with the situation and have a good game.’

Bankier said: ‘It is difficult not to take history onto the court. Of course we will feel confident — we have beaten them once before.’
