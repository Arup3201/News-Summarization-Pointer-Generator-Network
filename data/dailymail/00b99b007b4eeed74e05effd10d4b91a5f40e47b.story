A teenage mother is fighting for her life after her 32-year-old lover beat her in the head with an axe, severing her tongue and badly damaging her eye.

Evangelino Olivas Colon ambushed 17-year-old Filis Elizondo Orellana at the makeshift hut where they live in Baia Mare, northern Romania, three days after she'd moved out because he beat her.

As their six-month-old and two-and-a-half-year-old daughters watched, Colon picked up the axe and swung it repeatedly into her head and face. 

Brutal: The axe used in a savage attack on a 17-year-old mother-of-two by her partner after they rowed

He then reportedly called police and calmly waited for them to arrive and arrest him.

Paramedics found Miss Orellana unconscious and lying in a pool of blood. She was rushed to intensive care where she is now fighting for her life.

While the immediate motive for the attack is unknown, it is understood that Miss Orellana had moved out of the home she shared with Colon three days earlier after he had beaten her. 

She had been staying with their children at her parents house, but was apparently lured back to what local media described as their 'makeshift hut' by Colon to discuss their relationship problems. 

After emergency crews arrived, dozens of people gathered at the scene demanding the swift punishment of Colon, forcing police to call in reinforcements.

Neighbour Alina Medrea, 59, was quoted as saying by Central European News: 'When I went inside it was like something out of a horror film.

'The girl was lying on the floor unconscious in a pool of blood, one of her eyes was missing and the children despite their young age were terrified and crying. It was just horrific.'

Treatment: Miss Orellana was expected to undergo surgery today but doctors said there was little chance of saving her eye. Another severe blow to her jaw nearly severed her tongue, medics told local media

The two girls were taken by relatives, while Colon was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and taken to Baia Mare police headquarters.

He has since been transferred to the local hospital's psychiatric ward for evaluation.

Miss Orellana was expected to undergo surgery today but doctors said there was little chance of saving her eye. Another severe blow to her jaw nearly severed her tongue, medics told local media.

Dr Dacian Juga from the Maramures County Medical Service for Emergencies was quoted as saying by Central European News: 'When we found her she was in a coma.

'She has now come out of that but is in grave condition with severe wounds to her skull and her face.'

Law and order: After emergency crews arrived, dozens of people gathered at the scene demanding the swift punishment of Colon, forcing police to call in reinforcements

Witnesses: The six-month-old and two-and-a-half-year-old daughters of the couple who saw the attack

The news agency quoted a police spokesman as saying: 'This is one of the most horrific acts of domestic violence we have seen. The man is being held in custody until he can be taken to court.

'We need to see if the young woman survives before deciding what to charge him with.'
