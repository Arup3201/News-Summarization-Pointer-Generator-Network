Tour de France riders have been quick to complain about the selfie craze putting riders and fans in danger of injury, but one cyclist's patience has already completely snapped.

Team Garmin-Sharp's Lithuanian rider Ramunas Navardauskas lost the plot during the climb up Holme Moss in the South Pennines on Sunday and smacked phones out of the hands of two spectators trying to grab a cloe-up picture of the peloton.

Navardauskascan be clearly seen on video reaching out to angrily bat away one fans' phone, which was sent flying rom his grasp. The video then also shows Navardauskas preparing to do the same to another fan's device.

Le Tour riders had
 warned that spectators could get seriously hurt if they step into the 
road to grab pictures and selfies when they have their backs to the 
fast-moving peloton. 

Tejay
 van Garderen branded the craze ‘a dangerous mix of vanity and 
stupidity’ and appeared to be complaining on Twitter on Sunday night 
that he suffered a knee injury after a collision with a spectator.

‘Standing
 in the middle of the road with your back turned while 200 cyclists come
 at you, just to take a selfie. Think,’ said the American.

Support: Millions of fans lined the route as the tour began in Yorkshire but a few caused trouble

Concern: Some of the cyclists are worried at how close the crowds got on the narrow roads

Anywhere will do: Fans climbed walls and some even camped out to get pictures of the race

Sight seeing: Riders pass the Houses of Parliament near the finish of the 155 km third stage in London

‘I love the crowds and thank you for your support. But please give us room. Gonna ice my knee now.’

His views were echoed by Team Sky rider and British Olympic gold medallist, Geraint Thomas.

‘It was dodgy at times,’ he said. ‘The worst thing is when people have got their backs to the peloton taking selfies.

‘Do that if you want but go sit in a tree. It’s the new pain in the a**e that’s for sure. People don’t understand how fast we go.’ Sir Dave Brailsford agreed.

‘British people are fantastic at supporting sport,’ he said. ‘But the riders were worried about safety.’

Exuberant: Sir Dave Braislford praised the English fans but warned that the selfie craze was dangerous

Phones out: Dozens of fans take pictures on mobile phones as the Peloton cylces past
