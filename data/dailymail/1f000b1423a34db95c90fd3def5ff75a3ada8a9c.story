Home advantage is helping South American sides to dominate their opponents from other continents at the World Cup - and could give them the edge in the knockout stages with the likes of Argentina and Brazil looking certain to produce the tournament winner.

Statistics from the World Cup's 32 games so far show South American sides picking up almost twice as many points per game against teams from other continents than their traditionally strong European rivals.

And with the likes of Costa Rica and the USA doing well in their groups, even the Central and North American teams are performing better than Europe's best.

Favourites: Brazil and Argentina, South America's top sides, have the best chances of winning the World Cup

Much was made before the tournament about the impact of playing on South American soil and the challenges of a different climate for the Europeans, and it appears to be having an impact.

With Europe's champions Spain already out, as well as England and Bosnia and Herzegovina, the traditional European giants have been outshone by the South Americans - managing just 1.19 points per game compared to the host continent's 2.33 average.

Unsurprisingly, teams from the Asian Football Confederation have been the poorest performers with lowly-ranked Australia, Iran, Japan and South Korea failing to win a game between them.

Highlight: Tim Cahill scored a wondergoal against Holland but teams from the Asian confederation are winless

No European team has won a World Cup on South American soil before - and it shows. South America have the edge when the two continents come together, winning five of the six clashes.

The South American contingent have only dropped points in three games so far - Brazil's 0-0 draw with Mexico, Uruguay's 3-1 defeat to Costa Rica and Ecuador's 2-1 reverse against Switzerland.

On their home continent the South Americans, led by the likes of hosts Brazil, Argentina and Colombia, have proven too hot to handle for their European counterparts and look perfectly set for one of their sides to secure a fifth triumph on home soil.

Hot shot: Argentina's Aguero

Home: Brazil's Oscar

Surprise: Chile's Sanchez

Heartbreaker: Uruguay's Suarez
