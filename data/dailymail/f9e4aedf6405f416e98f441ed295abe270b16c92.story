Both screens on the Samsung and LG 105-inch TVS are said to use the 21:9 ‘CinemaScope’ aspect ratio.

They will also both have resolutions of 5,126 x 2,160.

This
 resolution provides 11.1 megapixels per frame.

By comparison, HDTV 
screens have 1920 x 1080 resolution screens with 2.1MP per frame. 

4K UHD, with its resolution of 3840 pixels x 2160 has 8.3MP per frame.

According to Samsung's press release, its version uses 'a new proprietary picture quality algorithm' which
 is said to make colours appear 'sharper and deeper.'

This
 means the images will be 'twice as vivid' of other Ultra HD TVs. that 
delivers optimised colour and a greater feeling of depth.

Philips has, until now, been the only company to release the superwide 21:9 aspect ratio sets, but retired the format recently.

It is called CinemaScope because it is the ratio used in some cinema screens.

LG claims its 105-inch model will used LCD screens, rather than OLED panels, to offer 'breathtaking clarity' that more evenly distribute colour and brightness. 

The technology in both screens is either sharper than 4K UHD, with its resolution of 3840 pixels x 2160 and 8.3MP per frame.

4K UHD has twice 
the horizontal and vertical resolution of the HDTV format, with 
four times as many pixels overall.

Both TV sets will be unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show on 7 January. The resolution of the screens, LG's model is pictured, provides 11.1 megapixels per frame. By comparison, HDTV screens have 1920 x 1080 resolution screens with 2.1MP per frame and 4K UHD offers 8.3MP

Samung also announced a 4K 110-inch screen in Berlin in September - although it is not curved,

The vast panel has been likened to looking through a window and 
will be on sale from next spring.

It is one of the new generation of supersize ultra high-definition TVs which promise astonishing picture clarity.

For those who cannot wait, the 98-inch S9 version is on sale in Britain for £40,000.

However, there are smaller models with screens of 50 to 60-inch screen with more modest price tags of around £5,000.

Curved TVs are expensive compared to normal flat TVs. For instance, the Samsung's 55-inch curved TV (pictured) costs around £7,000 compared to around £2,000 for its flat screen equivalent

Next
 year’s football World Cup in Brazil will be the first major event to be
 broadcast in full Ultra HD to viewers in Japan, while the Rugby World 
Cup in England in 2015 will be the first in the UK.

Consumer
 electronics guru, Barry Fox, said the images on the new sets are 
extremely impressive, offering a far better experience than 3D.

‘The pictures are mind-blowing, it is like looking through a window,’ he said.

Samsung’s
 Michael Zoeller, senior director of European sales and marketing, said 
the screen is so big that players would appear almost life-size to 
viewers during a football match.

‘This looks stunning. The screen in nearly 2.5 metres across,’ he said.

Speaking at the CES exhibition in Las Vegas, experts claim that curved screens may be better suited to smaller devices, used by one person at a time

The South Korean electronics giant also unveiled a television that allows two people to watch different shows
at the same time.

The S9C features a giant 55-inch curved screen to give
viewers a cinema experience in their living room.

The television, expected to cost around £7,000, boasts a
cutting-edge OLED screen - offering the ‘amazing’ MultiView feature.

Viewers wear special glasses that pick up one piece of
content at a time, with audio delivered through a built-in earpiece.

‘Two people can watch two different programmes at the same
time in full screen in full HD and even in 3D with Samsung MultiView glasses,’
said Zoeller.

‘It is like having two televisions in one.’

Another TV in the range, announced in Berlin in September, was the S9 OLED television. It features a curved screen, which Samsung claims makes the viewer feel like they are 'standing in an arena'
