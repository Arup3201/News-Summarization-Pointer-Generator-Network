A social worker has been suspended for 12 months after she turned up at a couple's house shouting 'baby murderers' and threatening to kill them.

Joanna Burgess admitted being part of a mob outside the house in July last year, where she was heard to shout out threats to kill before a brick was thrown at the property.

She was arrested and, following her conviction by magistrates, was this week hauled before the Health and Care Professionals Council (HSPC) which suspended her.

Social worker Joanna Burgess pleaded guilty at Kettering Magistrates' Court to being part of a mob outside the house where she was heard to shout out threats to kill before a brick was thrown at the property

Elena Elia, a solicitor for the HCPC, told the hearing that Burgess turned up with others outside a home on July 8 last year.

'She was heard to shout 'baby murderers' and was heard to shout out threats to kill a victim inside the property,' Ms Elia said.

She added: '(Burgess) was a member of the party responsible for throwing a brick that injured the victim who required sutures.

'The victim was fearful that the group would smash her door down and further injure her.

'After her arrest, she maintained silence but stated that she had known the victim for some years and had previously given a statement to the police about the victim.'

It was not said at the disciplinary hearing who the target of her abuse was.

The panel was told Burgess had been charged by police following the incident and had pleaded guilty before magistrates in Kettering, Northants., to using threatening language and disorderly behaviour.

She was given a 12-month conditional discharge, and ordered to pay Â£175 pounds costs.

The HCPC panel decided to strike Burgess from the register for one year for her behaviour.

Panel Chair Brian Wroe said: 'This type of bullying behaviour undoubtedly calls into question the suitability of the perpetrator, Ms Burgess, to remain able to work in social services.

'Ms Burgess' conduct on July 8, 2012, undermines public confidence in the profession and also impacts, albeit indirectly, on the safety of any clients of Ms Burgess.'
