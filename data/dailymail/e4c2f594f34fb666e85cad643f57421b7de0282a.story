In celebration of the first anniversary of Washington state's legalization of marijuana, a festival for up to 500 people will be held at the Seattle Center's Fun Forest amusement park.

Pot advocate Ben Livingstone lobbied for the festival, which will include food, music and of course, marijuana, for three months before city officials approved the plan.

Livingston said Seattle Center officials initially rejected the idea because marijuana remains federally illegal.

December 6 2012: Voters approved an initiative to decriminalize the recreational use of marijuana in Washington state, an event being celebrated this year with a 'pot festival'

He refused to accept the first rejection he was handed, citing two previous events in the city where public consumption of marijuana was legal, and finally prevailed.

Pot party: John 'The Freak' smokes a cigar-sized marijuana blunt after the Cannabis Freedom March in Seattle, on Saturday, May 11, 2013

A spokesman for Mayor Mike McGinn told 
the Seattle Times that the city wanted to support a legal activity, but 
Livingston’s party marked new ground for Seattle Center.

First-time event: Officials say Livingston's festival at Fun Forest is a trial that they will monitor closely

'We’re working to create best practices for private events where you can smoke marijuana,' said Aaron Pickus.

Livingstone had to overcome two laws in gaining permission for the party, according to the Seattle Times.

First, it's illegal in Washington to smoke marijuana in view of the general public.

Second, the clean-air act does not allow employees to be subjected to marijuana smoke.

To address the first, Livingstone plans to install two fences to shield the general public from the view of people smoking marijuana. Second, he will use volunteers instead of Seattle center employees at the event. 

Livingston forked out $1,900 to use 
part of the 74-acre Seattle Center on December 6, the anniversary of the
 day Washington’s recreational pot law took effect, between 3pm and 
11pm.

Noting
 that Pearl Jam's tour will end in nearby KeyArena that night, he told 
the Seattle Times he'd like to extend an invitation to the band.

'Hey, if they want to come over,' he said, 'we could bill them as "Heady’ Vedder," "Stoned" Gossard and Mike "McWeedy."'
