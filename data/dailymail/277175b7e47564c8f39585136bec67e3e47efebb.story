Violent: Christopher Chittock strangled his girlfriend and dumped her body in the sea

A Briton who strangled his girlfriend during a sunshine holiday and dumped her naked body in the sea was jailed for 24 years yesterday.

Christopher Chittock, 38, had broken Sarah Shields’s nose and smashed her head on rocks before throttling her in Mogan, Gran Canaria, after she sent texts to an ex-boyfriend.

Sarah, a Katie Price fan who once 
dreamed of becoming a lingerie model, told Mr Newham she had been 
bathing topless at their holiday apartment in one message.

Another from her to her ex read: 'It 
would be good if you were here. It’s not the same with Chris.'

Chittock,
who met Sarah through work at an Ipswich gas firm, burned her belongings then flew home, telling his family the 23-year-old had left him for another man.

Spanish police identified Sarah as a 
murder victim after being contacted by British counterparts and Chittock
was extradited to Spain in September 2010.

Forensic experts described Sarah’s 
murder in court as brutal and said the half litre of blood they 
extracted from her stomach during an autopsy showed her nose was broken 
at least one to two hours before she was killed.

It was revealed Chittock, a divorced father-of-one, had been given community service for assaulting Miss Shields a month before the holiday in July 2010.

Her ex-shop worker mum Angela and a best friend urged her to leave her violent boyfriend.

Tragically she told them before 
agreeing to give Chittock a second chance and moving back in with him: 
'Don’t worry, it’s was a one-off, it won’t happen again.'

He was arrested in Suffolk and extradited. He denied murder but was convicted after a three-day trial.

Angela and Sarah’s retired lorry driver dad David broke down in tears in court after the jury’s guilty verdict was read out.

Chittock’s dad and brother Terry and Carl and ex-wife Catharine, mother to their nine-year-old, also attended the trial.
