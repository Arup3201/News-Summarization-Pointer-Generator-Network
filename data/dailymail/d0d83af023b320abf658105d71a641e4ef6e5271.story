Argentina may have got their World Cup campaign off to a winning start against Bosnia on Monday but it appears not everyone was impressed.

Sead Kolasinac own goal gave Argentina the perfect start after three minutes before they scored arguably one of the best goals of the tournament - an incisive passing move that was deftly finished off by Lionel Messi for his first goal at a World Cup.

Despite the positive result, one Brazilian paper was still fairly damning about their performance.

Bold: Brazil newspaper slam Argentina's performance in their victory over Bosnia on Monday

Rio-based paper Lance boldly declared: 'Is that all you've got? Argentina play badly and need an own goal to beat Bosnia. Oh, and Messi scored a goal'.

Brazil and Argentina are, of course, great rivals so Lance's stance may be slightly biased, but there's no denying Argentina were not at their vintage best against Bosnia.

That being said, however, Argentina - along with Brazil - are many people's tips to make it all the way to the final and surely will improve as the tournament progresses.

But the question is, will Lance come to regret their front page on July 13.
