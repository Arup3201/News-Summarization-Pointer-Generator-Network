The allegations against 57-year-old Michael Fine were detailed in an emergency court motion from the Lorain County Bar association, which wants him immediately suspended

An Ohio lawyer is being investigated after being accused of hypnotizing a female client to force her into sexual activities.

The allegations against 57-year-old Michael Fine were detailed in an emergency court motion from the Lorain County Bar association, which wants him immediately suspended. 

At least one more woman has also gone to police with reports that Fine, who has been practicing hypnotism for 30-years, had attempted to hypnotize her while discussing her divorce proceedings.

He is married to a court reporter and the father of two girls. 

Identified as 'Jane Doe' in the affidavit, the woman wanted Fine to represent her in a child custody case.

She told police she had 'strange memories and feelings' after meeting with him on numerous occasions, The Smoking Gun reports.

'She would be unable to recall substantial portions of the meetings, and afterwards she would realize her clothes and bra were out of place and moved, and her vagina was wet,' according to investigator Richard Thomas.

She recorded her next two telephone calls with Fine to get further evidence.

While one call starts out with talk of her case, Fine but when Fine 'learns she is alone, he places her in a trance.'

The conversation turns into one of 'an explicit sexual nature, wherein he induces her into multiple orgasms.'

While he persuades her that she is 'being made love to by the world's greatest lover' once the conversation is over she would 'appear normal and only remember their discussions regarding legal matters.'

There was a similar phone call made on October 21. 

At least one more woman has also gone to police with reports that the 30-year veteran had attempted to hypnotize her while discussing her divorce proceedings at his office

Investigators then put a wire on Jane Doe before the pair met on November 7 at Fine's office.

During that conversation, 'Fine begins sexual dialogue, explaining sexual acts that he will do for her.'

When police came into the room he was holding her hand and rubbing her shoulders.

Another client, called 'Jane Doe 2' also alleged that Fine tried to hypnotize her. 

She said that besides attempting to seduce her, he would comment on her appearance and ask about her sex life with her husband.

She told authorities she 'felt the loss of time during her meetings…as she cannot recall how so much time passed during the meetings for what she remembers discussing.'

Jane Doe 2 also told authorities she was sickened that he preyed on her while being 'so upset and distraught about her marital situation when she went to him.'
