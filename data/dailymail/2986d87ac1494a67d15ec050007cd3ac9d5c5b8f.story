A deadly illness spread by rat urine in river water has reached record levels,  latest figures show.

Cases of Weil’s disease, a bacterial infection which attacks the kidneys and liver, have doubled in the past two years.

It can be contracted after swimming in  rivers and lakes – which may be of concern after the recent hot weather.

There were 70 hospital admissions for Weil’s disease last year – more than any other 12-month period in the past ten years and double the figure for two years ago, according to NHS records.

The illness – also known as leptospirosis – has claimed four lives in the UK since 2009.

Olympic rowing champion Andy Holmes died of Weil’s disease in 2010 aged 51, after it is believed the bacteria entered his body through blisters on his hands.

It can also be transmitted through cuts and scratches or the lining of the mouth, throat or eyes, after contact with infected rat urine or contaminated water.

People who work near waterways are most at risk. Last year’s casualties included two fish farmers, a wildlife park worker and two water sports instructors.

Also infected were a professional gardener, a builder clearing out a swimming pool and a pub manager cleaning out flood water.

Although rats are the main carriers of the disease, it can also be spread by animals such as cattle, mice, foxes and badgers.

Last year’s only fatality was a 60-year-old woman from a travelling family, who experts said had been exposed to rats as well as water that could have harboured the bacteria.

The sharp rise in Weil’s disease comes as the Government is being urged to sanction the use of stronger poisons to crack down on rat infestations.

Pest control experts fear the winter flooding could be partly to blame for the increase in infections, as it forced rats out of their usual habitats.

A Public Health England spokesman said Weil’s disease is still rare, adding: ‘The risk can be greatly reduced by not swimming or wading in water that might be contaminated.

'If you develop a flu-like illness seven to 12 days after contact with fresh surface water or with rats, then visit your GP and explain you may have been exposed to leptospirosis.

‘Complete recovery is the usual outcome after leptospirosis, and there are unlikely to be any long-term effects.’
