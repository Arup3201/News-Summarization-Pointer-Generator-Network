After Tom Jones and Will.i.am lost two artists last week, it was time for Jessie J and Danny O'Donoghue to say goodbye to some of their contestants this week.

Students Hannah Berney, 21, and Ruth-Ann St.Luce, 18, ended up in the bottom two of their teams after failing to secure enough public votes.

Jessie ended up saving Toni Warne, 34, after admitting Ruth-Ann had been suffering some pitch issues.

Jessie told Toni: 'I feel like people haven't seen the best of you yet. Your vocal ability is so extreme. Your voice is timeless.'

Moving on to Ruth-Ann, she admitted: 'You're 18 and the things you can do with your voice, so many singers will dream to be able to do. But you do have issues with pitch. Your path is gleaming, this is not the end for you.'

Ruth-Ann from London said: 'Its been a crazy rollercoaster and I've learned so much from Jessie, from all of you.

'Some of the comments have been life-changing. This is not the end of me at all.'

The Script frontman Danny ended up saving musical theatre performer Max Milner, 21, at the expense of Hannah.

Ahead of making his decision, Danny said: 'Max, you've shown for many sides. Its been a pleasure being your mentor.

'Hannah from day 1 we've always been a collaborative team. This show is showcasing what amazing people are out there. The way you did that mash-up from the old to the new...'

After choosing Max, he assured her: 'There's no difference in talent. We're a team. We always have been. This is not the end of Hannah Berney.'

An emotional Hannah replied: 'This is probably been the best year of my life. I turned 21. I've sung for the queen, I've been on live television.'

Safe: Team Jessie members Cassius Henry (left) and Vince Hill won enough public votes

Meanwhile, the rest of Team Jessie - Cassius Henry, Becky Hill and Vince Kidd progressed to next week's show after securing enough public votes.

And in Team Danny - Bo Bruce, Aleks Josh and David Julien - were safe for another week after receiving enough votes.

After a furore last week after viewers discovered Sunday night's results show was actually taped on Saturday, the judges and the hosts decided to change outfits to 'freshen' up the episode.

However, all the remaining contestants were still in the same ensembles from Saturday's live show.
