Vladimir Putin will be at the same event as Prince Charles
at next month's ceremony to mark the 70th anniversary of D-Day - but there will
be no potentially awkward encounter just days after the royal likened the
Russian president to Adolf Hitler.

The future king and Mr Putin are both due to be guests at
the commemoration of the Allied landings in France on June 6, along with other
world leaders, including the French president.

It will be the first time the two of them have been in the
same place since his unguarded comment yesterday during a visit to the Canadian
Museum of Immigration in Halifax, Nova Scotia.

Today Clarence House said that the pair will not be meeting
and added that they 'never had' been going to. 

Clarence House has also refused to deny his remarks and a
spokesman said: 'We would not comment on private conversations. It was a
private conversation at a reception for war veterans.'

A news source close to the Kremlin accused Prince Charles of risking an 'international scandal' with his words

Vladimir Putin is to snub Prince Charles at next month's ceremony to mark the 70th anniversary of D-Day after the royal likened the Russian president to Adolf Hitler

At the June 6 Ceremony of Remembrance, at Sword Beach, world leaders and heads of state are expected to sit together.

However Clarence House said today that there was no possibility of Mr Putin and Prince Charles meeting and that the Prince would leave 'immediately afterwards' avoiding the possibility of an awkward confrontation.

The move came as a news source close to the Kremlin accused Prince Charles of risking an 'international scandal'.

The website of major popular newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets ran a story headlined: 'Prince Charles compared Putin to Hitler, claim the media' and warned that Charles 'risks complicating the already far from cloudless relations between  Great 
Britain and Russia'.

It branded Charles' words an 'unexpected 
announcement' and accused him of a 'badly chosen' moment for his claim, 
coming ahead of the commemoration in less than a fortnight.

Royal comment: Prince Charles likened Putin's actions in Ukraine to that of Adolf Hitler in the 1930s

Today the Daily Mail revealed that in a 
withering verdict on the actions of the Russian president in Ukraine, Charles
 told a woman who lost relatives in the Nazi Holocaust: ‘And now Putin 
is doing just about the same as Hitler.’

By late morning in Moscow, was no initial official response from the Kremlin to the royal's words.

Prime
 Minister David Cameron has refused to be drawn into the scandal and 
today told BBC Radio 4's World at One he was 'not going to comment on 
the private conversation of anyone'.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the prince should be 'free to express himself'.

'I
 obviously can’t comment on a conversation which was clearly a private conversation and I’m not going to start comparing one period of
 European history to another, but Prince Charles is able, I would have 
thought, to be free to express himself. 

'I
 have never been of the view that if you are a member of the Royal 
family somehow you have to enter into some sort of Trappist vow of 
silence,' he told BBC Breakfast.

'I
 think he is entitled to his views, but don’t know whether those were 
his views because I just don’t think providing a running commentary on 
private conversations is useful to anybody.'

Charles' comments are likely to be seen as a criticism
 of the West for failing to confront Mr Putin over his seizure of 
Crimea. The annexation was the first by a major power in Europe since 
1945. 

Observers have compared the crisis in Ukraine with Hitler’s takeovers of Czechoslovakia and Poland.

They have pointed to the similar use of disguised special forces to stir up tensions in disputed areas.

 prince is on a whistlestop tour of Canada with the Duchess of Cornwall –
 they have 41 engagements in just three and a half days.

On
 Monday, the pair paid a heartfelt tribute to Second World War veterans 
and their families over tea at the museum in Halifax’s docks.

Prince Charles, pictured today with his wife Camilla, made the comments during the royal couple's visit to the Canadian Museum of Immigration in Halifax, Nova Scotia

He was introduced to Marienne Ferguson, a museum volunteer who fled to Canada with her Jewish family when she was just 13.

The 78-year-old was born in what is now the Polish city of Gdansk, a key flashpoint in the Second World War.

A free city under the terms of the Versailles Treaty after the end of 
the Great War, it was seized by the Nazis on the first day of fighting 
in 1939.

Mrs Ferguson and 
her parents, two sisters and grandmother had managed to obtain permits 
to sail to Canada. But other members of her family failed to flee before
 the German army arrived.

Along with an estimated six hundred Jews from the city, they were sent to Nazi camps where they met their deaths.

Russia and China were last night frantically haggling over the ‘deal of the century’ on gas and investment.

Putin hopes to secure £240billion in guaranteed energy exports to China, making Russia far less dependent on Europe.

The two sides were edging towards a ‘significant joint declaration’, including military plans, although Russian sources said they had  so far failed to agree on gas prices.

As relations between Russia and the West deteriorated rapidly, China issued a friendly statement on Ukraine to Moscow and the nations conducted a joint naval exercise.

Mrs Ferguson was given the chance to tell her incredible story to Charles as she showed him the museum’s exhibits.

At the end of the visit, and surrounded by media, Charles made his off-the-cuff comment about the situation in Ukraine.

It was heard by several witnesses. Mother-of-three Mrs Ferguson said: 
‘I had finished showing him the exhibit and talked with him about my own
 family background and how I came to Canada.

‘The prince then said “And now Putin is doing just about the same as Hitler”.

‘I
 must say that I agree with him and am sure a lot of people do. I was 
very surprised that he made the comment as I know they [members of the 
Royal Family] aren’t meant to say these things but it was very heartfelt
 and honest.

‘I told the prince that while my family 
and I were lucky to get a permit to travel, many of my other relatives 
had permits but were unable to get out before war broke out on September
 1. They were sent to the concentration camps and died.’

Russia's President Vladimir Putin speaks to the media in Shanghai. China signed a landmark deal Wednesday to buy Russian natural gas worth about $400 billion, giving a boost to diplomatically isolated President Vladimir Putin and expanding Moscow's ties with Asia

US secretary of state Hillary Clinton sparked uproar in Washington recently when she said very much the same as the heir to the throne.

Lashing out at Moscow’s plan to issue passports to ethnic Russians in Crimea, she said: ‘Now, if this sounds familiar, it’s what Hitler did back in the 1930s.’

What is unusual, however, is for a senior royal to express an opinion publicly on such a clearly sensitive diplomatic issue.

Charles is often criticised for meddling in domestic affairs of state as well as the infamous ‘black spider’ memos – so called because of his scrawling handwriting – that he is said to frequently write to ministers on issues close to his heart.

But international issues, particularly one as sensitive as this, are considered taboo.
