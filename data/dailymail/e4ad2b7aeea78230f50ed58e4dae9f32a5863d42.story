George Best and Bobby Charlton were in opposition the last time Preston faced Manchester United – but thanks to a second-half comeback inspired by Paul Gallagher they will now take on Wayne Rooney and Co in the fifth round.

It was in 1972 that Alan Ball’s North End were beaten by a double from Alan Gowling in the fourth round of this competition.

Preston boss Simon Grayson, however, has some recent FA Cup history of his own against United having been in charge of the Leeds side which won 1-0 at Old Trafford in 2010.

And he cannot wait to welcome Louis van Gaal’s men to Deepdale some 43 years on from their last visit.

‘It was a fantastic occasion when we (Leeds) won that day, but this is a different club and one which deserves this game (against United), they haven’t had enough like it in recent years,’ said Grayson.

His side recovered from a goal down to set up the lucrative, televised tie. Trailing to Jamie Murphy’s first-half opener, former Blade Gallagher levelled from a sublime free-kick and scored the tie-clinching third after Paul Huntington headed the visitors in front.

But the game should have been out of sight way before then. Preston bossed the opening half but were thwarted at each advance by goalkeeper Mark Howard.

Murphy scored against the run of play when he shot through the weak grasp of Thorsten Stuckmann on 38 minutes and the lead was undeserved.

But Leicester loanee Gallagher – as he had done in the original fixture – lashed in from a deadball before Huntington stole in from a corner. Gallagher then got his second from the penalty spot after Jay McEveley tripped Chris Humphrey.

And Grayson reflected: ‘It was everything that we deserved. Their goal rocked us a little bit but I told the players to keep believing when we got in at half-time.

‘It took a lot of character to come back and Paul Gallagher controlled the game. He was excellent and could have scored three or four.

‘We knew what was at stake and this will give us a massive boost.’

Blades boss Nigel Clough rested 10 players at the weekend in anticipation of this game against their League One rivals. 

But Murphy’s goal apart they rarely threatened and Clough, whose side were beaten by Spurs in the semi-final of the League Cup last week, had no complaints.

‘It’s a bitter disappointment. We knew what was riding on this and that’s why I made those changes at the weekend,’ he said.

‘But we never got going and didn’t have any energy about us. Preston did a professional job on us.

‘It’s scant consolation that we’re now free to concentrate on the league.’

Grayson, meanwhile, insisted that promotion to the Championship remained Preston’s priority. But a sold-out Deepdale a week on Monday will certainly prove an exciting distraction.
