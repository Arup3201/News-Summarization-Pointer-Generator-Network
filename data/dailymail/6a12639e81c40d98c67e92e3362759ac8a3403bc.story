Juventus general manager Giuseppe Marotta insists the Serie A outfit is the ideal place for Paul Pogba to grow into one of the world's best players.

Pogba's agent Mino Raiola has hinted that the Frenchman could be keen on leaving the Old Lady in the summer, with the likes of Manchester United, Manchester City and Real Madrid all said to be interested in the 21-year-old.

However Marotta has responded to Raiola by insisting the club will have the final say on Pogba's future.

Pogba has been linked with a move to the likes of Manchester United, Manchester City and Real Madrid 

Marotta, speaking to reporters, said: 'His sports rights are with Juventus only, so it is Juventus who will decide.

'However, the decision of the player is definitely critical. But, beyond this, we're speaking about a boy who is 21-years-old, he is very young, I think he can grow from game-to-game.

'Here is the natural habitat for him - for his growth and his development. We recently extended his contract and we did with the perspective of wanting to build a competitive team around him.'

The 21-year-old joined Juventus in 2012 after leaving Manchester United on a free transfer
