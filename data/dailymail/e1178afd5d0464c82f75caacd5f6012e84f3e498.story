A Royal Marine veteran who single-handedly took out a German machine-gun posts on D-Day has been awarded his second green beret- after he lost his 60 years ago.

Frank Cramp, 94, handed the prized headgear back along with the rest of his kit when he left the armed forces in 1954.

The ex-corporal only discovered afterwards he was allowed to keep it and spent six decades regretting his mistake.

A proud Mr Cramp puts on his second green beret, (left) the 94-year-old veteran had been given his first beret as a Royal Marine in WWII (right) but had given it back along with the rest of his kit when he left the armed forces in 1954.

But when Navy chiefs heard about his plight they decided to reward brave OAP Frank with a replacement green beret - the official headdress of the British Commandos of WWII and still worn by Royal Marines today.

Londoner Frank emigrated to Edmonton, Canada, in 1957 but travelled to France for a tour of the Normandy beaches.

The former commando landed ashore there on Sword Beach in 1944 with pals from 45 Commando - but he soon found himself alone when his landing craft had to retreat, along with all his comrades.

Undeterred, he went on a one-man surprise mission to take out a German machine gun sentry and managed to take out the enemy with barely a scratch.

Lt Col Richard Cantrill, 42 Commanding Officer, re-presents Mr Cramp with the famous headdress at the Dewerstone beauty spot on Dartmoor where current Royal Marines receive their first green beret on completion of training

When Frank decided to mark the 70th anniversary of the landings his daughters and the Royal Marines Association arranged for him link up with 42 Commando at Bickleigh Barracks in Devon - where Frank was once an instructor.

Navy brass then whisked him to Dewerstone, a remote beautyspot in Dartmoor in Devon, where Royal Marines are awarded their green berets after finishing training at nearby Lympstone Commando Training Centre.

Lieutenant Colonel Richard Cantrill, commanding officer of 42 Commando, said it was a pleasure to give the hero his prized hat back.

He said: “It was a great pleasure for me to host Frank. Hearing his extraordinary recollections of his landing on Sword Beach, and beyond, was fascinating and served as a reminder as to why commando forces were first raised, and how they were employed.

Frank Cramp has been re-presented with the famous green beret after giving it up by mistake 60 years ago

“We discovered that Frank had always regretted not keeping his green beret when he was demobilised, and so we were delighted to re-present Frank with his commando headgear, in the same spot on the edge of Dartmoor where modern commandos receive theirs.

“He remembers saying to comrades in Normandy after a number of near death experiences that he must have a guardian angel and would probably live to be 100.

“He then said to me, with obvious glee, ‘Just six years to go, Rich’.

“I am so pleased that Frank, with great support from the Royal Marines Association, has remained a close member of the Royal Marines family - once a Marine, always a Marine.”

Mr Cramp, originally from Poplar, said he enjoyed his visit immensely.

He added: “I was surprised and overwhelmed with the recognition and respect I received.”
