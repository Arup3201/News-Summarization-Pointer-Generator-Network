Vicky Pryce quit her highly-paid job 
hours after her conviction for perverting the course of justice and will be sentenced alongside her ex-husband Chris Huhne on Monday, it emerged today.

The warring former couple are both facing jail terms at the 2pm hearing at Southwark Crown Court.

The disgraced ex-wife of the former Lib Dem 
minister had nurtured a substantial media profile in her own right, 
frequently appearing on current affairs programmes in her guise as a 
well-regarded economist - but her career is now in tatters.

Pryce was found guilty by a jury 
yesterday of perverting the course of justice by taking speeding points 
for Huhne in 2003. The former energy secretary had already pleaded 
guilty to the same charge.

It carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, although the average sentence is around 10 months.

Both 58-year-old Huhne and economist Pryce, 60, have been warned to be under no illusion about what punishment they face.

Pryce took a 10-month sabbatical on full pay to clear her name, but she resigned as a senior managing director at FTI Consulting yesterday.

Success: Pryce, pictured in 2002, had built a successful media career as an economic pundit but now faces jail

Hiding: Chris Huhne covered his face from photographers using his umbrella today while Carina Trimingham, the woman he left Vicky Pryce for, dashed also into their Central London home in the rain

The role had allowed her to earn huge sums as pundit on TV, radio and in newspapers, giving her views on the recession and the crisis in her native Greece.

A spokesman for FTI Consulting told MailOnline: ‘We can confirm Vicky Pryce resigned yesterday after the verdict.

‘She was on a full-pay sabbatical since May 2012 until her resignation’.  

Their spokesman refused to reveal her salary, but it is believed to be in excess of £100,000 a year.

Pryce was born Vasiliki Courmouzis in Athens, and studied at the London School of Economics.

After picking up an MSc in monetary economics, she became an economist at Williams and Glyn's bank, then at Esso Europe.

In 1986 she was appointed chief economist at KPMG, where she became a partner and stayed until 2001.

She later became chief economic adviser at the Department of Trade and Industry, now known as the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, earning £110,000 a year.

Her world fell apart yesterday when a jury unanimously found her guilty.

Pryce’s had plotted to ‘nail’ the former minister after he dumped her for his bisexual political aide and claimed that he bullied her into taking his speeding points.

The disgraced pair will stand side by side when they return to court to face jail, probably within two weeks.

In a final twist, 60-year-old Pryce could end up with the longer prison term.

Facing jail: Vicky Pryce swept away from court without saying a word having been found guilty of perverting the course of justice

Legal experts anticipate that the couple will be sentenced to at least six months, but that Huhne will be given a small discount for his guilty plea while Pryce dragged her family through two trials.

The multi-lingual professor, made a Companion of the Order of Bath by the Queen, must brace herself for a prison sentence among petty thieves, drug addicts and fraudsters.

Huhne has already stepped into political oblivion after admitting his crime and resigning from his Eastleigh seat, triggering last week’s by-election.

Driven by jealously and anger, Pryce 
sparked the police investigation by leaking his illegal actions eight 
years earlier to the Press.

But
by pointing the finger at her ex-husband she also incriminated herself 
and ended up trying to escape justice with the unusual defence of 
marital coercion.

Ultimately
the jury was left with the stark choice of whether to believe her as 
she raked over the ashes of her 26-year marriage without fear of 
contradiction from Huhne.

Outside court an emotional Pryce stood 
alongside her solicitor, who spoke on her behalf and said she was 'very 
disappointed to have been convicted' and thanked her friends, family and
colleagues for their support.

On the first day of
their trial on February 4 Huhne caused gasps of disbelief after he 
finally admitted the crime after years of telling ‘anyone who would 
listen’ - including the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister - 
that he was innocent.

Pryce said she had taken the points for her former husband but she denied the charge, claiming he forced her to do it.

The case dates back to 2003 
when Huhne was caught speeding in his BMW near Stansted Airport.

He thought he would lose his licence, 
jeopardising his chances of being nominated as the Lib Dem candidate for
Eastleigh, Hampshire.

Guilty: Vicky Pryce in the dock at Southwark Crown Court as she was told she had perverted the course of justice

Pryce admitted taking the blame for him but claimed he forced her to take the 
points, using 'marital coercion' as a defence. 

He went on to win the seat, despite 
an eventual driving ban later that year after he was caught talking on 
his mobile phone while driving.

She said he put his political career first throughout their 
26-year marriage, while she was forced to compromise her own successful 
career.

But the jury 
unanimously failed to accept her version of events as the prosecution 
convinced them she was not the 'quivering jelly' she claimed.
