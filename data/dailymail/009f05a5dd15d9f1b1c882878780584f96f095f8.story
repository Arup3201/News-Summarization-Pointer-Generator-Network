The Ryder Cup Pro-Celebrity Challenge is in full swing as four golfing legends take to the course with a host of famous sporting faces.

Kenny Dalglish, Alan Hansen, Gavin Hastings and Sportsmail's Jamie Redknapp are among those paired up on Thursday with former Ryder Cup captains Colin Montgomerie, Ian Woosnam, Mark James and Corey Pavin.

Liverpool icon and keen golfer Dalglish may have divided loyalties this weekend, though, as the 22nd Merseyside derby clashes with the Ryder Cup in his native Scotland.

The Scot, who got closer than most to the action at Gleneagles after being invited to play in Thursday's challenge on the PGA Centenary course on the eve of the event, will only get to see two of the three days' play live.

Dalglish will miss Saturday, though, as he will be at Anfield for Liverpool's early kick-off against Everton. He said: 'I didn't get a captain's pick so I'll be going home for the game but I'll be here Friday and Sunday.'

Dalglish added: 'It's an honour and a privilege to be involved in this event ahead of a Ryder Cup in Scotland.'

When asked what it was like to sign for Liverpool from Bournemouth in 1991 while Dalglish was manager at Anfield, Redknapp said: 'It was an amazing feeling. He was me hero, and then I signed for Liverpool, the best club in the world. I loved every second of it.'

And Redknapp joked: 'He (Dalglish) left about a month later, probably after watching me play!' 

Each celebrity was paired up with one of their professional golfer counterparts and  Liverpool great Hansen told the Ryder Cup website: 'It will be a great experience to play on the PGA Centenary Course the day before The Ryder Cup tees off, and in such illustrious company. 

'I'm sure it will be an entertaining game, with plenty of banter and interaction with the galleries. Hopefully we'll give the fans at Gleneagles and those watching at home a good show.' 

The final standings once the Ryder Cup Pro-Celebrity Challenge came to an end showed wins for Pavin and Hansen, and Dalglish and Woosnam. 

The official opening ceremony is to follow.
