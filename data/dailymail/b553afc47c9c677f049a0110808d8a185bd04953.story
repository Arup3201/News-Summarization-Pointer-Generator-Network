A woman who was lost in Oregon's mental institutions for nearly five decades before she was tracked down by her filmmaker brother has died aged 59.

Molly Daly, who was the subject of an award-winning documentary, 'Where's Molly?', in 2007, succumbed to respiratory failure after a visit to the emergency room on Friday, her brother said.

Jeff Daly produced and directed the documentary about his sister and Oregon's mental institutions. He was by her side as she passed away, he told the Oregonian.

He said 
that her death came nearly 10 years to the date that he reunited with 
his sister, who had been sent away by his parents when she was two and 
he was six.

Loss: Molly Daly, left as a child with her brother and right with him in 2010, was lost for nearly 50 years in mental institutions before he tracked her down in 2004. Molly has now passed away

Missed: After Molly, right, was taken away, Jeff would often ask for her - but was told to forget about her

'Everybody 
that knew Molly agreed that our lives were enriched from having the 
opportunity to share her love, laughter and friendship,' he said. 'And 
Molly asked for so little in return - a kiss and a hug, sing her a song 
or just simply take her for a stroll in her wheelchair, or as she called
 it, "a walk'um".'

She
 had been born with apparently mild disabilities, including a lazy eye 
and a clubfoot, but she was sent away after the impediments troubled her
 mother, who wanted to keep up good appearances.

One day, the little girl vanished and she was put in what was then known as Oregon Fairview Home, which has since closed.

Whenever Jeff Daly asked his mother, 'Where's Molly?', she would tell him not to ask, and he soon forgot about her.

Old days: Molly, center, only had minor disabilities - including a lazy eye and a clubfoot - but was sent to a mental institution when she was two because her mother, right, wanted to keep up good appearances

Forgotten: Molly is pictured aged five, left, and right as a teenager after being sent away to the home

New home: Molly was sent to 'the Oregon State Institution for the Feeble-Minded', pictured

But his 
father continued to visit his sister. After staff told him not to return
 because Molly would get too upset when he left, he returned repeatedly 
under the guise of a clown.

The visits 
eventually stopped and Molly became institutionalized, only inflicted 
with the disabilities she portrayed because she was brought up in such 
surroundings, her brother previously told CBS.

Jeff
 only began thinking about her again in 1994 when he rekindled with a 
childhood sweetheart, Cindy, who asked him how his little sister was 
doing. He was ashamed that he had no idea where she was.

After he and Cindy married and his parents passed away, they began looking for Molly.

Family: Her father, left, continued to visit her but was told not to come back because it upset Molly so much - so he only returned in a clown costume. Jeff went looking for his sister when his parents, right, died in 2004

Close: Jeff Daly said he felt guilty for not seeing her but they went on to develop a great relationship

Support: Jeff sought out his sister with the help of his childhood-sweetheart-turned-wife, Cindy, left

In
 2004, they discovered a secret file in his father's belongings with the
 contact details for her new home in Hillsboro and promptly found out 
where she was. They reunited days later.

'I wasn't 
sure what to expect,' he told CBS. 'But the first time I saw her, it was
 pain. I felt pained that I hadn't seen her. I knew that I was wrong.'

But he rebuilt a relationship with her, visiting her frequently.

'He has, as one person said it, "filled a hole in his soul." And it really did,' his wife Cindy told CBS.

In his email to the Oregonian, Jeff Daly said he was glad for the decade he did get with his sister.

'Now
 we will remember how many lives my little sister was able to touch, how
 many families she helped to re-unite and how fortunate we were to be 
able to know and learn from her,' he wrote.
