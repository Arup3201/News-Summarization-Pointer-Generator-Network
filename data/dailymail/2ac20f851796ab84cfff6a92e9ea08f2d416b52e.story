Cardiff manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer insists the club have made no approach for troubled West Ham midfielder Ravel Morrison.

Solskjaer knows Morrison well from his time on the coaching staff at Manchester United and has already signed several former United players since arriving at Cardiff in January.

Reports have linked the Championship club with Morrison who has a court case hanging over him.

In demand: Ravel Morrison has emerged as a target for Cardiff City boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer

Morrison will appear at Manchester Crown Court on August 28 after being charged with two accounts of common assault, against his former girlfriend and her mother, and harassment.

The 21-year-old is training with West Ham and can still play for the club if selected.

Solskjaer told a press conference ahead of Cardiff's Capital One Cup tie at Coventry: 'I can't speak about other clubs' players and Rav is a West Ham player.

'But we've not made any offers whatsoever.'
