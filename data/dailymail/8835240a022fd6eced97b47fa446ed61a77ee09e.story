A five-year-old girl watched as her mother was beaten to death by her boyfriend, police have said.

After witnessing the attack, Jessica Frantes pounded on her home's front door in Winslow, New Jersey and when her 19-year-old sister opened it, she found the girl covered in blood.

'Mommy is dead!' the terrified child said, the South Jersey Times reported.

Their mother, a 41-year-old nurse, Jennifer Bongco, was found after midnight on Friday lying in the street and covered in multiple stab wounds by a pizza delivery man. She was later declared dead.

Her boyfriend, 52-year-old Kevin Ambrose, was arrested on murder charges less than 24 hours later after police found him at Atlantic City's Tropicana Casino, where he had reserved a hotel room.

Before her mother's death, the little girl was seen on camera with Bongco and Ambrose as they left a convenience store around 12.20am, according to a probable cause statement.

At 12.29am, police were sent to the home after receiving a 911 call.

The female caller told police that she had heard a banging at the door and opened it to find Jessica with blood on her clothes, saying that her mother had been killed.

Jessica later gave a recorded statement to detectives and told them 'Kevin hurt Mommy' after the couple started arguing inside the car, police said.

Her mother ran out of the vehicle and Ambrose started hitting her, she told authorities.

Ambrose then drove the girl back to the house and made her walk to the front door, the Courier-Post reported.

'I just saw her covered in blood,' the girl's sister, Maria Bongco, said. 'I knew she wasn't hurt because the first thing she said was, "Mommy's on the ground. Kevin killed her".'

Police have not said if they have found a murder weapon.

Her body was discovered by a pizza deliveryman around 12.30am and she was pronounced dead at 4am.

Ambrose has been charged with murder and his bail has been set at $2 million, according to the Camden County Prosecutor's Office.

Loved: Jennifer's 19-year-old daughter said she could not imagine life without her loving, smiling mother

Ambrose only has one previous criminal charge - a drugs charge from 2014. His Facebook page suggests he has several grown children.

Bongco's daughter who expressed her pain on her Facebook page.

'Mommy I love you more than anything in this world,' she wrote. 'I'm nowhere near ready to live a life without you. Please always stay with me. I never imagined this day would come so soon. Not for another 50 years at least. I love you so so much & I just want you back here with me.'

Speaking to the Courier-Post, Maria added that she and her sister had never liked Ambrose.

'He was nasty,' she said. 'He would just scream at me and my sister all the time.'
