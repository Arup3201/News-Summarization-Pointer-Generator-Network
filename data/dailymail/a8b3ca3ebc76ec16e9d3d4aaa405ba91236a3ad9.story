Shocking new footage has emerged of the moment on Friday night when a Montenegrin fan hurled a lit flare at the head of Russia goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev.

The video shows the fans behind the goal in the moments following the start of the game, before one throws a flare onto the pitch that connects with the player.

The incident occurred within a minute of kick-off, causing the game to be suspended for around half an hour.

Play resumed but trouble then erupted between the players in the second half after Russia's Roman Shirokov missed a penalty with the score at 0-0. With further objects coming from the stands, both teams left the field and German referee Deniz Aytekin called the game off after 67 minutes. 

The head of the Montenegro FA (FSCG) has branded fans who forced the abandonment of Friday's Euro 2016 qualifier against Russia as 'barbarians'. 

A statement from UEFA on Friday night said it would 'wait to receive reports from the delegate and referee to open disciplinary proceedings'.

In a statement published on the FSGC's website, the association's secretary general Momir Durdevac said: 'The match from the first minute was on the verge of interruption.

'You saw how many people were involved in the organisation, how many times we asked the crowd to refrain from everything.

'But it seems that we do not deserve, neither the country nor the national team, a place in the big competition.

'They are here to disrupt, they are here to be barbarians. When we play against the great teams and great players, they are here to denounce these players, not to enjoy their skills.

'To interrupt the match, to throw something on the pitch, and then chant: "Montenegro, I love you" - it is such hypocrisy, it's such primitivism that should not be seen anywhere.

'For me, the game should not have continued after the first minute.'

Durdevac also questioned whether players will accept future international call-ups amid such an atmosphere.

'This is a human catastrophe,' he said. 'This is the final straw and someone has to say, "Enough!".

'What can we do after this? We pay a fine, we say goodbye to a great competition. And then there is a new game, and again there are flares and again there are chants, everything that should not be.

'Sorry, but I had to say this because as players responding to the call for the national team, to do your job - of course it would scare them. Who is going to come to play for the national team under these conditions?

'They all have a big dream. A big dream for little Montenegro is to appear in the big competition - but in these conditions?'

Akinfeev was treated in a local hospital after the early incident, but the 28-year-old was able to travel back to Moscow with his team-mates later in the evening.

Team doctor Edward Bezuglov told the Russian Football Federation's (RFU) website that the goalkeeper had been diagnosed with 'a concussion and burns to the neck'. 

And the player himself issued a short statement on www.rfs.ru, saying: 'I want to say thank you to all those who supported me. I feel fine now.

'Unfortunately these things can happen sometimes in football. But I hope nothing like this ever happens again in Montenegro or any other country in the world.'

Russia coach Fabio Capello also felt the game should have been stopped after Akinfeev was hit by the flare, a course of action requested officially by the RFU in communication with UEFA's match delegate.

RFU president Nikolai Tolstoy said: 'After the match the RFU filed an official protest to UEFA.

'We had warned the UEFA delegate immediately after the incident in the first minute, when our goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev was hit by a flare. The decision to continue the game after the episode was made by the delegate after consultations.

'The team were forced to continue the match but I want to stress that we warned the delegates and have filed a protest to UEFA. In our view, the match should be forfeited by Montenegro."

Capello added: 'We are waiting for the decision of the match delegate. But in my opinion the game should have been stopped immediately.'
