Manchester United are edging closer to bringing Juan Cuadrado to Old Trafford after Spanish newspaper Sport say an agreement has been made with the player.

Louis van Gaal is hot on the heels of the Fiorentina winger, but interest from Barcelona created a problem for the £36million-rated Colombian, which the front page acknowledges.

Sport say the future of Dani Alves at the Nou Camp is key to the move on Monday's cover.

Sport: The Spanish newspaper report that Juan Cuadrado has reached an agreement with Manchester United

Fellow Spanish newspaper Marca lead on Real Madrid's Gareth Bale heading back to the motherland. 

No, not Tottenham. It is in fact the  Cardiff City Stadium in Wales where Real Madrid play Sevilla in the Super Cup final.

Marca's headline - 'Super Bale returns home' - is accompanied by bullet points, which remind readers: 

- The Welshman arrives like a bull to his third final with Madrid

- He has gained muscle bulk and explosiveness in pre-season

- Top scorer in the summer for Los Blancos

- His goals were decisive in the last two finals. Now he wants to be a prophet on his home turf

Sticking with our Spanish theme, Mundo Deportivo say Thomas Vermaelen from Arsenal will not be Barcelona's only signing.

The Nou Camp outfit bought the defender for £15m from under Man United's noses, and the La Liga giants want 'one more' according to the front page.

Andoni (Zubi) Zubizarreta is quoted as saying: 'If the opportunity arises to improve the squad, we will do it.' It adds they 'continue to wait on Cuadrado' so Van Gaal best watch out.

On to Italy, and Tuttosport report on how Juventus beat Australian All-Star team of 'Del Piero, Llorente, Pogba and Pepe'. 

They opt for a large picture of former Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba, looking rather happy with himself at Juventus, where he's scored 12 goals in 63 Serie A games.

They also report that AC Milan are eyeing up Stephane Mbia and that Man United want Nigel de Jong.

Corriere dello Sport say Arturo Vidal is heading for the exit, with Man United yet again on the front page of another foreign newspaper.

The Juventus midfielder is pictured next to a headline that reads: 'Vidal plans exit.'

The Italian newspaper claims his agent is in England to negotiate with the Old Trafford club.
