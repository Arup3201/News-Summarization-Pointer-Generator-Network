Worker ants can process information far more efficiently than Google, a new study claims.

The researchers found that while an individual ant that is hunting for food walks a random path, their collective foraging behaviour transforms from chaos into order.

Together, they can process information efficiently to secure ample food to allow a colony to thrive.

Chaotic? A new study claims that the while an individual ant hunting for food (pictured in this scanning electron micrograph) walks in a random way, their collective foraging behaviour changes this chaos to order and makes the more efficient than Google, experts claim

Woodland ants work together to fire smelly acid into the air to ward off predators. The group attack using formic acid to protect a nest is enough to scare off woodpeckers and jay birds.

Fire ants bind together to build a life raft in order to survive floods. They use their claws and mandibles to grip each other and link together in a similar way to how waterproof fabric is woven.

An individual ant’s exoskeleton is moderately hydrophobic so it can shrug off water, but the ants enhance their water repellence by linking their bodies together.

Rock ants continually monitor the area near their nest in case they find a more suitable home, especially if there's is in a state of disrepair.

Lead researcher Carolina Doran from Bristol University said: ‘This strategy of adjusting their information gathering according to their actual needs and the real value of higher rungs on the property ladder may help ants to evaluate their housing market in a measured and thorough way that puts many of us to shame.’

Nasa has send 800 common ants to live on the International Space Station to teach scientists how they move in low gravity. It is hoped that the eight colonies will give experts new ideas of how to build robots that interact with each other.

Last week, a study from the Georgia Institute of Technology revealed that ants' skills at building stable underground tunnels in, loose sand could help engineers design the next generation of rescue robots.

They used cameras to monitor the way fire ants use their antennae as extra limbs to stop themselves from falling.

The mathematical study found that the creatures are capable of using problem-solving strategies and the move from chaos to order happens in a surprisingly efficient, self-organised way.

Understanding the ants could help experts analyse similar phenomena such as how humans behave when using the internet or even lead to the development of smart transport systems.

The Chinese-German research team expressed everything that is known about the foraging of ants in equations and algorithms and fed them into computers.

They found that ants use intelligent navigational strategies to divide themselves into ‘scouting’ and ‘gathering’ groups when searching for food.

While individual wandering ants might seem chaotic, they are actually leaving a trail of pheromones to allow the ‘gathering’ ants to shorten their journeys to food sources.

As 
ants carrying food repeat the route, a ‘self-reinforcing effect of 
efficiency’ comes into play, saving the colony time and energy, 
according to the study published in the Proceedings of the National 
Academy of Sciences.

Professor Jurgen Kurths of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research told The Independent
that single ants quickly 
become part of an orderly line of ants crossing the woodland floor.

He told the Independent: ‘That
 transition between chaos and order is an important mechanism and I’d go
 as far as to say that the learning strategy involved in that is more 
accurate and complex than a Google search.’

Better than Google? Study co-author Professor Jurgen Kurths said: 'These insects are, without doubt, more efficient than Google in processing information about their surroundings'

‘These insects are, without doubt, more efficient than Google in processing information about their surroundings.'

Previous studies have suggested that older ants lead dangerous scouting parties as they are the most expendable in a colony, but this new study suggests the opposite is true.

The scientists revealed that the experience of individual ants contributes to the group’s foraging success, so older ants have a better knowledge of a nest's surroundings.

The foraging of younger ants is a learning process rather than an effective contribution to scout food, according to the study.

‘While the single ant is certainly not smart, the collective acts in a way that I'm tempted to call intelligent,’ Professor Kurths said.

‘The ants collectively form a highly efficient complex network and this is something we find in many natural and social systems.’

Fast food: While single ants can appear chaotic (pictured), they quickly become part of an orderly line of ants crossing the woodland floor, thanks to pheromones laid down by 'scouting' ants to ensure that workers can carry food as efficiently as possible
