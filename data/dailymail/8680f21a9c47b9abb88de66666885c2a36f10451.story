Arjen Robben has revealed he turned down Louis van Gaal's advances after the outgoing Holland coach asked him to follow him to new club Manchester United.

Van Gaal's Holland side secured third place at the World Cup with their 3-0 win over Brazil and afterwards Robben claimed that the 'special' 62-year-old wants him in his team at Old Trafford.

'After the match he asked me to come to Manchester,' Robben told Dutch TV station NOS.

But unfortunately for United fans, Robben rebuffed the approach, and said: 'I'm very happy with where I am now. I told [Van Gaal] that.

'Van Gaal is the best coach I've had. We've got a very special relationship, but I will not make a transfer.

'I'm at the right place at Bayern so that has nothing to do with Van Gaal or United.'

And Van Gaal later confirmed his interest in bringing Robben to Old Trafford. 'He is always welcome. But he knows this himself,' he said.
