A teenage farmer who spends her days getting muddy on her family farm is set to swap her Wellington boots for high heels and her overalls for a bikini in a bid to be crowned Miss England.

Louise Bakewell, 19, from Somerset, says she is 'thrilled' after a win in her local pageant saw her reach the finals of Miss England.

It will be a far cry from her day to day life: a regular day for Louise will see her dressed in dirty clothes tending to the cattle and sheep at her parents' farm in Somerset.

She beat hundreds of other hopefuls to be crowned Miss Somerset - and was informed of her win in a phone call while delivering a lamb in a field.

Louise Bakewell, 18, found out she was a finalist in the beauty competition while lambing sheep in a field at her family's farm in Somerset

Louise will swap her wellies and overalls for a bikini and heels in a bid to be crowned Miss England

Louise is a livestock farmer, car mechanic, medical student and now Miss England finalist

She was inspired to enter Miss England after being complimented by a shop assistant while trying on a ball gown.

The medical student - who is also a trainee car mechanic - will now represent her county at the Miss England finals next month.

She said: 'I was out lambing and the sheep had just given birth to a little lamb when I saw my mum sprinting down the field after me.

'She told me to run back up to the house because Miss England had phoned and wanted to talk to me.

'I had to sprint back up and only had time to wash my hands before I was on the phone to them for an interview. They told me I had got it. It was quite surreal.

'I don't think my friends and family will believe me really. They just see me as the farmer; I have never done any modelling before.

Louise is a hard worker, being both a mechanic, helping out her family both on her parents livestock farm and at her mother's nursery

'But the competition is about more than just looks - I'm just normal really.'

Louise helps out with the Highland cattle and sheep at her family's farm in Henstridge, Somerset, where she lives with mother Amanda, father Jim and three older brothers, Matt, Rob and Chris.

She also took up a job as a trainee mechanic a couple of weeks ago for extra income.

'I just do all sorts of stuff around the farm. It is mostly cleaning up after the cows - not very glamorous,' she said.

'I also help out in my mum's nursery looking after children. In fact, when Miss England called me again to ask me for some details I was telling a kid not to throw mud around - again not exactly glamorous.'

Louise claims she is nothing special and has no idea why she was chosen to represent the county in the Miss England race next month

Louise was inspired to enter the contest when a shop assistant told her she had beauty pageant potential while she was shopping for a ballgown for her first year prom at Cardiff University last year.

But Louise was forced to put her medicine degree - and beauty pageant ambitions - on hold shortly afterwards when crippling back pain meant she had to return home to Somerset.

She endured a complex operation on the nerves surrounding her spine at Christmas and finally felt well enough to put herself forward to become Miss Somerset a couple of months ago.

The Miss England competition takes place at the Riviera International conference centre in Torquay between June 13 and 16.

Miss England bosses said they chose Louise because she has all the attributes of a Miss England winner

Around 50 girls will battle for the crown, a place at the Miss World competition and prizes worth Â£30,000 including a luxury holiday to Mauritius.

Louise is hoping to reflect her Somerset roots during the creative rounds of the competition.

'There is a one round which is an eco round where you have to make your own dress,' she said.

'I think I'll think of Somerset and make mine from a potato sack. It will probably look really bad, but there you go.

'I'm really excited, but I'm not sure it has sunk in yet.'

Miss England bosses said they chose Louise because she has all the attributes of a Miss England winner.

Director Angie Beasley said: 'She is sporty, intelligent and photogenic, as well as being charity minded and beautiful.'
