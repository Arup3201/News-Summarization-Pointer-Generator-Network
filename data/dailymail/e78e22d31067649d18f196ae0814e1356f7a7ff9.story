Found dead: Anna Oung, 29, was found in the trunk of her car with visible bruising on her body but her cause of death was not immediately known

A cell phone GPS tracker led to a significant but sad break in a murder case.

The husband of Anna Oung used the location services on his wife's cell phone to lead him to his missing wife's car in Los Angeles.

Because he did not have the keys to the car, he called police who then opened the trunk and found Ms Oung's dead body.

The husband, whose name has not been released, filed a missing persons report an hour before he helped find his wife's body on Tuesday evening.

The car, and Ms Oung's body, were found near the campus of University of California-Irvine, though her husband has no idea how or why it got there.

Very few specifics about the case have been released publicly: police have announced that there was visible bruising on Ms Oung's body, but they would not say how or what caused the injuries.

They have not ruled the 29-year-old's death a homicide, but are deeming it 'suspicious'.

Final resting place: The car was found parked near the University of California-Irvine, though the husband had no reason why it would be there

Home: Though the couple lives in this Los Angeles home, there is no clear reason why Oung would have been near the college campus

No suspect or motive has been determined in the case, and the husband has been fully cooperating with police.

'It's really sad... shocking,' one of Ms Oung's neighbors told local KTLA.

'He was always bike riding and just always with her. Every time she came, he was outside helping her park... They were always happy,' the neighbor said of the couple.
