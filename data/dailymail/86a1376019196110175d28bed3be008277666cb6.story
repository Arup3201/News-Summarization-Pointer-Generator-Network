Reg Turnill, the man who brought the space race to a generation of Britons, has died at the age of 97.

As the BBC’s space correspondent from Sputnik through to the shuttle era, Mr Turnill was the voice of extra-planetary exploration for more than 40 years.

Described by friends as an ‘astronaut who never made it to the Moon’, he reported on every Nasa Apollo mission, including breaking the story to the world that Apollo 13 was in trouble in 1970.

Star: Reg Turnhill, who reported on space exploration from the 1950s until the 1990s, died at the age of 97

He saw the development of modern aviation at first hand, reporting on radio and television from the 1950s until the 1990s – a period which saw a dramatic transformation in the possibilities of space exploration.

Later, in semi-retirement, he brought the drama of space to life for schoolchildren on the BBC Newsround programme.

Last summer, well into his 90s, he contributed to coverage of death of Neil Armstrong, the first man on the moon.

Mr Turnill’s eldest son confirmed the news of his father’s death yesterday. Michael Turnill, 72, said his father retained a ‘remarkable’ mind until his death.

He had carried on an active role in aerospace journalism was still writing stories just eight weeks ago, he said.

Mr Turnill’s career began at the age of 15 as a telephonist for the Press Association in Fleet Street, typing up stories phoned in by reporters.

He was promoted to become staff reporter at the news agency and in 1956 was recruited by the BBC as assistant industrial correspondent.

In 1958, he was made the BBC’s air and space correspondent, with a brief to cover defence.

It was the start of the jet age and he reported on the introduction of passenger flights, including taking a seat on Concorde’s maiden flight in March 1969.

But it was his coverage of space exploration which really captured the imagination of his viewers and listeners.

He was friends with Wernher von Braun, the architect of Nasa’s moon programme, enabling him to secure interviews with many Apollo astronauts during his career.

Mr Turnill later recalled how he became the first to report that the Apollo 13 mission was in trouble.

‘It was 10 o’clock Houston time, 4am London time, and I just looked in to a deserted mission control,’ he said in 2007. 

‘All was going well, most journalists had gone to bed. I was just turning to leave the deserted press centre when I heard the famous words: “Houston, we’ve had a problem”. 

‘By 5am I’d broken the story. The astronauts were in deadly danger.’

Nick Spall, fellow of the British Interplanetary Society, described Mr Turnill as ‘one of a kind’.

He said he had spoken to the correspondent recently and said he was ‘full of his old enthusiasm’.

‘My key memory was of this father figure on TV in the 1960s, explaining it all in a very British way,’ said Mr Spall. He was the astronaut who never made it to the Moon.’

In his later years, he lived in Sandgate, Kent. Mr Turnill passed away peacefully in the early hours yesterday (12th) at the Pilgrim’s Hospice in Ashford, where he had been for the past month.

He is survived by his wife Margaret and their two sons.
