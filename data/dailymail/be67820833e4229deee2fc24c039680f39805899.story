The nutritious plan, obtained by TMZ, was devised by her former private chef and adheres to the WeightWatchers point system where each food has a 'points value' based on calories and fat content.

The plan, featuring dishes such as super low calorie egg white omelettes, chicken satays, whipped chick peas, 
soba noodles and shrimp skewers, has clearly worked wonders.

smoothie diet consisting of five days of three smoothies a day, gradually working in snacks and meals over time.
