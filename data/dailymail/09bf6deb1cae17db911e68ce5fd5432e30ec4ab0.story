A row has broken out after a soldier was refused cigarettes at a newsagent because he was wearing his military uniform.

Duane Fahy from the 1st Battalion of the Duke of Lancaster's Regiment, tried to buy a pack of 20 Lambert and Butler at Alpha News in St Helens, Lancashire earlier this week.

But he was astonished after the shop assistant refused to serve both he and a colleague because they were in their 'combats'.

Alpha News in St Helens, Lancashire has apologised after a worker refused to sell cigarettes to a soldier because he was in uniform. A notice has since been put up in the shop claiming the incident was down to a mistake

The 27-year-old sapper, who is based at the Catterick Garrison, was taking part in a recruitment day in the area when the incident happened.

He said: 'I just went into the shop with a work colleague to buy cigarettes. We were both in uniform and when I asked for them, he refused to serve me.

'I was taken aback and a bit confused as to why he was so determined not to sell us something as small as a pack of cigarettes.

'We'd never been in there before so I asked him why and he said it was because we were in military uniform. I thought I'd heard him wrong when he first said it.

'To be honest I was outraged, I've never been refused anything just because I'm a soldier, but he was adamant.'

He added: 'I didn't want to make a scene, I'm not like that, so we just left feeling very confused.'

Army chiefs initially criticised the newsagent's actions, but have since said the incident should not be used as an excuse for trouble.

A MoD spokesman said: 'The Army is aware of an incident in which it appears two of our soldiers were refused service in a newsagent due to them being in uniform.

'This appears to be the result of a genuine misunderstanding for which the business has apologised.

'The Army condemns anyone who is seeking to exploit this minor incident for their own divisive ends.'

Alpha News was shut yesterday following protests by locals angry about the soldiers' treatment.

Protests have since been held outside the shop in response to the two soldiers' treatment

A sign put up in the store states: 'We were under the impression that by law, we were not permitted to serve under 18s and army personal (sic) in uniforms cigarettes.

'This has been checked with trading standards and this is clearly not the case.

'We sincerely apologise to everyone for this misunderstanding and we regret any offence we may have caused.'

London and Cambridge Properties, who run The Hardshaw Centre where the newsagents is based, added: 'We believe this was a genuine error and not the result of any form of discrimination.'

Police have now been called in to investigate a number of comments online surrounding the affair.

A Merseyside Police spokesman said: 'Police are monitoring the situation and the owner of the business is helping officers with their inquiries.

'Police are also aware of offensive and threatening comments being posted on social media network sites towards this business.

'Although police have not received a report of complaint from the shop, a full investigation into the wider comments being made is underway.'
