Balram Singh, 21, escaped jail after a hit-and-run on Kate Allan, 23, in Bristol

A hit-and-run driver mowed down a woman on a pedestrian crossing as he rushed to sign on and collect his benefit money.

Balram Singh sped through a red light and ploughed into Kate Allan as he raced to the job centre in Brentry, Bristol.

The 23-year-old victim narrowly managed to move her head from out of the path of the VW Polo’s wheels - but Singh drove off and left her screaming in agony on the road on December 29 last year.

However he has dodged a prison sentence after a judge accepted that Singh, 21, showed 'genuine remorse'.

Bristol Crown Court heard that Singh ignored witnesses’ pleas to stop and drove off to a benefits office where he was late to collect a job seeker’s allowance payment, which is £67.50 a week.

And when police finally caught up with them, he said he drove off because he wanted to search the internet and see what would happen to him.

Prosecuting, Nadeem Aullybocus told the court Singh took the car from outside the family home without permission.

He only had a provisional licence at the time, meaning he was not supposed to drive unsupervised, and therefore was uninsured.

Miss Allan was waiting at a pelican crossing near the Crow Lane roundabout in Henbury. When the traffic lights went red and the green light for pedestrians lit up, she started to cross - before Singh ploughed into her with such force the windscreen of the car cracked.

In a victim impact statement read to the court, she said: 'If I had not moved my head out of the way of the car, he would have driven over me.'

As the Polo was driven away a pedestrian and a driver who witnessed the crash both looked Singh in the eye and signalled for him to stop but he carried on.

Meanwhile, Miss Allan was 'screaming out in pain', Mr Aullybocus added.

The court heard he carried on to the benefits office, but was too late to collect his payment.

Police soon tracked Singh down and when they spoke to him he asked 'how is the lady?'.

When asked why he had not stopped after the crash, Mr Aullybocus said Singh told police: 'I wanted to come home and look on the internet to see what would happen to me.'

Miss Allan suffered pain in her right leg, neck, ribs and down the left side of her body. She was off work for two weeks but was still getting pain two months later.

Her anxiety medication had to be increased following the incident and she was nervous about leaving her house for a couple of weeks.

In her victim impact statement, she said: 'The incident has left me really shaken and I’m anxious about crossing the road in the future. All in all, the incident has caused me a lot of pain and problems.

Singh admitted aggravated vehicle taking, failing to stop at a road accident, driving without insurance and driving otherwise than in accordance with a licence.

Mitigating, Rodney Wilson accepted it was 'sheer luck' that Miss Allan had not been seriously injured. He submitted a number of positive character references and said his client had shown genuine remorse.

He told the court Singh had been expecting a lift to the job centre from his brother, but his brother had been called into work.

Singh then borrowed the family car to drive the three miles himself.

When he saw the crossing lights changing he sped up to try to get through before they went red.

Mr Wilson said he did brake momentarily after the collision, but drove off 'in panic' and in fear of what those who witnessed the incident might do to him.

Recorder of Bristol, Judge Neil Ford QC spared him from prison because of his lack of previous convictions, early guilty pleas and 'genuine remorse'.

He imposed an eight-month sentence, suspended for two years. Judge Ford disqualified Singh from driving for two years, ordered one year’s supervision, 300 hours of unpaid work, a four-month curfew and Singh must pay Miss Allan £1,500 compensation.
