President Obama awarded America's highest military honor today to Army Staff Sergeant Ty Carter, 33, for being the 'essence of true heroism' during an infamous 2009 Afghanistan firefight.

Obama bestowed the Medal of Honor on Carter, who resupplied ammunition, provided first aid to the injured, and risked his life to save others during a six hour 'blizzard of bullets and steel' that reigned down on Command Outpost Keating in October 2009.

The husband and father of three was also praised by the president for 'his courage in the other battle he has fought,' referring to the injured soldier's openness about his battle with post-traumatic stress syndrome.

Outnumbered: In the Battle of Kamdesh, Carter and his comrades were outnumbered and outgunned in their vulnerable position surrounded by mountains

Carter received the award in a White 
House ceremony today, making the Spokane, Washington native only the fifth 
living recipient of the decoration for heroic actions in Iraq or 
Afghanistan.

Carter's finest hour came at the bloody battle of Kamdesh in eastern Afghanistan when he was a specialist stationed with the Army's Black Knight Troop at Keating.

On October 3, 2009 more than 300 Afghan insurgents launched a coordinated attack at 3am on the remote outpost, a vulnerable position surrounded by the craggy Hindu Kush mountains in Afghanistan's Nuristan province.

Of the 53 soldiers stationed at the base, eight were killed and 25 injured.

'We kinda knew what was going to happen. We just didn't know when,' Carter told CBS, calling their position, surrounded on all sides by mountains as 'undefendable.'

'We knew that the enemy would take advantage of the terrain and hit us hard.'Â

Carter himself was wounded but still battled against enemy combatants under intense pressure.

'The enemy was above us, behind us, all around us,' Carter told CBS News. 'We were cut off, surrounded, outnumbered, outgunned, low on ammo and everybody friendly who was in sight was either wounded or dead.'

'Perhaps 10 times,' said President Obama, Carter crisscrossed through showers of enemy fire.

At
one point in the battle, Carter carried Specialist Stephan L. Mace to 
safety, putting down his own weapon and facing open fire.

'It almost looked like he was crying,' said Carter, 'but he was too dehydrated to form any tears. He said, "Please help me."'

'Without
regard to his own safety, Specialist Ty Michael Carter... resupplied 
ammunition to fighting positions, provided first aid to a battle buddy, 
killed enemy troops, and valiantly risked his own life to save a fellow 
soldier who was injured and pinned down by overwhelming enemy fire,' the
Army reported in its citation of Carter. 'He did all this while under heavy small arms and indirect fire that lasted more than six hours.'

Carter was later told it was a good way to get killed.

'But I wasn't thinking of that at the time,' he said. 'I was thinking the more bullets I saw impact the faster I needed to go.'

Mace later died from his injuries, which Carter told CBS left him 'shattered.'

'The fact that either I didn't get to him in time or I didn't do the right thing made me believe that I had failed fully and completely,' he said.

It was the events of the Battle of Kamdesh that brought on Carter's PTSD, which President Obama mentioned today.

Position to make change: Carter has been working to ensure returning soldiers receive the mental-health care they need following his own PTSD

Obama said it was 'absolutely critical.. to put an end to any stigma' that prevents troops from getting treatment for PTSD.

Ty Carter spoke to CBS about his battle with PTSD recently.

'I don't like the 'D' on the end,' Carter said.

'I
don't believe in calling it a disorder,' he said.

'I believe that it's your body 
and mind's natural reaction to something traumatic... And if PT, 
post-traumatic stress is intense enough, it will affect your life. It 
will remove your ability to be happy and enjoy the company of your loved
ones.'

According to The Washington Post, the battle claimed a ninth life in Specialist Edward W. Faulkner Jr, 
who also battled post-traumatic stress disorder upon his return from 
duty and sadly committed suicide less than a year after the attack.

Since he returned home, Carter has become active in helping returning veterans get the mental healthcare they need and trying to remove the stigma attached to PTSD.

A Pentagon review later found that the Keating Outpost, which was closed immediately after the attack, should never have existed because it was too dangerous and almost impossible to defend.

One of only two Medal of Honor recipients still on active duty, Carter is 
now stationed with the 7th Infantry Division at Joint Base Lewis-McChord
in Washington State.
