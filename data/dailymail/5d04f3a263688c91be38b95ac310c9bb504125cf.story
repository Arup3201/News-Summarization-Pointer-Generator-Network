The mother of the two Chechnyan brothers suspected of setting off two bombs at the Boston Marathon was arrested last year for allegedly stealing $1,600 worth of clothes from an upscale department store.

Zubeidat K. Tsarnaeva's two sons have been accused of planting the two bombs that exploded at the Boston Marathon on Monday. She was arrested last year for allegedly shoplifting from a Lord & Taylor

Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev is still on the loose after being identified as one of the Boston Marathon bombers

Tamerlan Tsarnaev attended Bunker Hill Community College 
and was studying to become an engineer but took a year off to pursue 
boxing. He is a two-time Golden Glove champion

'This is a set up, my son would never ever carry out such terror attack,' she said Friday.

She went on to say: 'FBI knew everything what my son was doing, told me he was serious leader, that they were afraid of him.'

Mrs Tsarnaeva went on to say that Dzhokhar was raised in the US and 
insisted that 'no one ever talked about terror' in their house.

She stole $1,624 in women's clothes, according to a Patch.com story.

Her sons allegedly left two bombs, packed with ball bearings and other materials, near the finish line of the Boston Marathon on Monday.

The terror attack left three dead and 183 injured.

They were captured on CCTV by a different Lord & Taylor store on Boylston Street.

The FBI released those CCTV images of the two brothers Thursday evening and later that night Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, was killed in a shootout with law enforcement in Watertown, Mass.

A police officer was shot dead near the campus for Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Her other son, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, is still on the run and considered by authorities to be armed and extremely dangerous.

Tamerlan reportedly had a bomb strapped to his chest when he was killed while he and his brother robbed a 7-Eleven, tried to steal an SUV and threw explosives at police officers.

They used the carjacking victim's debit car to withdraw $800 from an ATM.

The entire city of Boston is on lock down with residents warned to stay indoors, public transport shut down and a no-fly zone around the city.

A transit police officer was critically wounded in the exchange of gunfire with the suspects.

Dzhokhar A Tsarnaev is believed to be a legal immigrant to the U.S., who arrived in the country one year ago from the Russian region of Chechnya which has been plagued by an Islamic insurgency stemming from separatist wars.

The 19-year-old, who attended Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, is an amateur wrestling champion.

The older brother attended Bunkerhill Community College and was studying to become an engineer but took a year off to pursue boxing.

They reportedly entered the United States with family in 2002 or 2003 and Tamerlan became a legal permanent resident in 2007.

The older brother Tamerlan attended Bunker Hill Community College and was studying to become an engineer but took a year off to pursue boxing. He is a two-time Golden Glove champion.

This is one of the Boston bombing suspects, Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev, 19, has been described as 'normal' by those who knew him

Dzhokhar was born in Kyrgyzstan. The family, which also included two daughters, Bella and Amina, had the status of refugees at the time they moved to Russia.

Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev went to a school in Makhachkala, the capital city of the Republic of Dagestan, between 1999-2001.

His former teachers at his first school described him as a 'normal child' today. 

‘He arrived at our school in the first form and departed in the second,’ Irina Bandurina, the secretary at Makhachkala’s School No.1, told RT.

Dzhokhar was born in Kyrgyzstan and was a successful wrestler in high school

‘They arrived from Kyrgyzstan and departed to the US. I’m telling you they lived here for a year. Not the whole year. They arrived at the school in 2001 and departed in March 2002 … There were four of them – two sisters and two brothers… It’s written here that they are from Kyrgyzstan.’

A friend of Dzokhar, Eric Machado told CNN the 19-year-old was just a 'normal American kid.'

'There was no evidence that would lead us to believe he was capable of any of this,' he said.

An uncle of the Boston bombing suspects said who died early Friday morning said Tamerlan was a 'loser.'

Ruslan Tsarni said that Tamerlan 'deserved it.'

'I wish they never existed,' Mr Tsarni, who lives in Maryland, told local Boston station WBZ.

He had not spoken to the boys since 2009 and said that he did not recognize them when he saw the photos released by the FBI on Thursday evening.

'I'm wordless... shocked,' Mr Tsarni said.

'They do not deserve to exist on this earth.'

Ruslan called Tamerlan a 'loser', he described his younger nephew Dzhokhar as a quiet kid.

The suspects' uncle, Ruslan Tsarni, spoke to the media and implored his nephew on the run to turn himself in. He also railed against his relatives for bringing shame on their family and country

Anzor Tsarnaev, father of the two suspects, said his boys 'could never have done this'

These CCTV images were released Thursday evening by the FBI. Tamerlan engaged in a shootout with law enforcement later that night and died

One of their sisters, who lives in New Jersey, said, 'They were great people. I never would have expected it.

'They are smart – I don’t know what’s gotten into them,' adding that her younger brother is 'an amazing child.'

The sister, who declined to give her name to the Newark Star-Ledger, said she sympathized with her brothers' victims.

'I’m not okay – no one is okay right now. I’m hurt for everyone who has been hurt. I’m sorry for all the people who are hurt and for all the people who lost their lives.'

Several former classmates described Dzhokhar as a friendly, smart kid, and they said they were shocked that he was part of the pair who killed three and injured more than 180 in the marathon bombings on Monday.

An unidentified friend told CNN that he 'hung out, went to parties, smoked some weed... its not like he's some foreign dude.'

A different uncle, Alvi Tsarni, who lives closeby in Boston was visibly upset when he spoke about his nephews.

'I don't believe any of my nephews are involved in this horrible incident,' Alvi Tsarni told the Boston CBS affiliate WBZ.

'If he did this I'm sorry too. It's crazy, it's not possible. I can't believe it. Who can do this stuff?'

The family tree is unclear, though the Associated Press spoke with the boys' father Anzor Tsamaev who lives in an area of Russia called Makhachkala.

'My son is a true angel,' Anzor said.

'Dzhokhar is a second-year medical student in the U.S. He is such an intelligent boy. We expected him to come on holidays here.'

The boys' aunt, Maret, is a surgeon who lives in Canada. She used to be in Chechnya and her acts as a battlefield surgeon are described in a book.
