Former Rangers commercial director Imran Ahmad has gone to court for a third time in a quest to freeze £620,000 of the Ibrox club’s assets.

If successful, lawyers for Ahmad could push Rangers closer to the financial edge after lodging a fresh claim at the Court of Session for £500,000 in unpaid bonuses plus legal expenses.

Last week, the Ibrox club launched a new £4million share issue in a statement to the London Stock Exchange in a move they hope will rebuild a ‘stable, sustainable and successful business’.

Conceding that external funding will still be needed even if the open offer is successful, however, the statement served only to trigger fresh speculation over cash flow at the club.

Ahmad has twice before lost similar motions. But counsel Kenny McBrearty QC told Lord Stewart that the former Zeus Capital executive is concerned about the stability of the club’s finances and fears Rangers could not afford to pay him by the time his claim for £500,000 plus legal costs reached court.

Ahmad’s advocate cited a sharp drop of 15,000 in season-tickets sales, with the last recorded figure running at 23,000.

Mr McBrearty said the latest plans for a share issue may only raise £3.6m after costs, adding: ‘There is a significant hole in the club’s finances for the forthcoming season.’

Lord Stewart continued the case until Friday when lawyers for Rangers will address the court.

Concerns over the likely success of the forthcoming open offer have been raised by claims current chief executive Graham Wallace will not invest any of his own money in new shares.
