BBC chiefs Lord Hall and Lord Patten will be grilled by MPs this week over an alleged ‘cover-up’ in the £3million inquiry into the Corporation’s failure to expose the Jimmy Savile scandal.

The Mail on Sunday understands the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee will call up Lord Hall, the BBC’s director-general since April, and Lord Patten, BBC Trust chairman, on Tuesday.

They will be asked about their refusal to investigate why key evidence about ex-BBC director-general Mark Thompson was excluded from the Pollard Review – the report into Newsnight’s axed expose of the disgraced DJ.

Last night, a Culture Committee source said it was ‘a certainty’ Hall and Patten would be tackled about the matter, while an MP said the BBC’s failure to act ‘smelt like a cover-up’ and the report needed to be changed.

Helen Boaden, the BBC’s former head of news and now the £340,000 head of BBC radio, told the review that she had told Thompson that Savile had been accused of sexually abusing girls at a Surrey school, in a phone call in November 2011.

Thompson – now chief executive of The New York Times on a £3.7million salary – maintains he was not told about the sexual abuse allegations until October 2012. 

Boaden’s evidence was excluded from the Pollard report when it was published, an omission a source close to the review – named after Nick Pollard, the ex-Sky News executive who chaired the inquiry – has admitted was  a ‘mistake’.

If Boaden’s story is accurate, Thompson will stand accused of bringing the BBC into disrepute by allowing it to screen tribute programmes to Savile after he died on October 29, 2011 – despite knowing about the allegations against him.

Lord Patten was made aware of the issue in a letter from Tory MP Rob Wilson on September 6 and shared the information with Lord Hall and Pollard. 

When Lord Patten advised Mr Wilson to speak to Pollard personally, Mr Wilson claimed Patten and the BBC were effectively ‘kicking the issue into the long grass’.

Last night, Mr Wilson said the report must be corrected to reflect the evidence. 

He said: ‘Lord Patten and Tony Hall have seen the evidence but are content to try and kick it into the long grass. This is starting to smell like a cover-up by the BBC.’

A BBC spokesman said the Pollard inquiry found that BBC management did not suppress reports on Newsnight about Savile as had been widely alleged.

‘We accepted his findings. We have seen nothing that would in any way affect that,’ he said.

A BBC Trust spokesman rejected the suggestion the chairman washed his hands of this matter.  

He said: ‘We have made clear to Rob Wilson MP that he should discuss his concerns directly with Nick Pollard, as a first step. That was the sensible and obvious thing to do.’

A Pollard Review spokesman said it ‘stood by the conclusions of its report’.
