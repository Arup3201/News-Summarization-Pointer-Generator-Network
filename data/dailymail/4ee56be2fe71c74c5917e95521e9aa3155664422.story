A new photo has emerged showing the gunman behind massacre at a suburban Milwaukee spa on Sunday posing for the camera with an assault rifle.

Radcliffe Haughton, 45, would have had to give up the weapon and all of his other guns once his estranged wife's restraining order, filed three days before the shooting, made it through the legal system.

His wife Zina is reportedly among the three women who were killed when he opened fire a Azana Spa in Brookfield, Wisconsin. Four others were hospitalized with non-life threatening gunshot wounds. 

Dangerous: This photo is believed to be Radcliffe Haughton holding an assault rifle. He would have been forced to give up his guns when a restraining order against him took effect

Troubled: Haughton, 45, had recently slashed his wife's tired and was given a restraining order

Police have not released the names of the victims in Sunday morning's shooting, but WTMJ-TV in Milwaukee quotes an anonymous source as saying Mrs Haughton was murdered in the attack.

Officers believe Radcliffe Haughton was looking for his wife when he entered the spa about 11.10am and began shooting.

The two were having marital problems and she had recently moved out of their house.

He committed suicide after the rampage inside the spa.

Mrs Haughton was a respected hair stylist at the salon who was highly sought-after by customers.

Court 
records show that a judge issued a order of protection against Haughton on Thursday, and said there was a credible threat against her.

Under that order, Haughton was required to turn in his guns -- though it's unclear when that part of the order would have taken effect.

The protection order was filed after an 
October 4 incident at the salon, when Haughton slashed his wife's tires 
in the parking lot.

Haughton's daughter, age 13, and Mrs Haughton's daughter from a previous relationship, age 20, 
were both found by police and are safe.

One of the them was at the salon at the time of the shooting, according to Brown Deer police chief 
Steven Rinzel.

During the investigation, cops encountered smoke from a small fire that had been started in the building, prompting them to issue a call for extreme caution and keeping them out.

Brookfield Police Chief Daniel Tushaus said at an evening news conference: 'It appears that he is deceased of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.'

He added: 'There is no other suspect that we are seeking.'

In an earlier statement to the press, Chief Tushaus said the shooting began at 11.09am Sunday morning inside the Azana Spa.

Chief Rinzel said that his department was familiar with Haughton - most recently on a domestic violence investigation at the home, which resulted in Haughton's arrest.

The Journal Sentinel contacted the suspect's father, Radcliffe Haughton Sr., who lives in Florida.

He said the he spoke to his son by phone last week shortly after his estranged wife had been awarded the restraining order against him. 

'I told him, whatever you do, don't do anything stupid,' Mr Haughton Sr. said.

'He told me, "I have to get out of Wisconsin."

'I am so saddened. I don't know what to tell you. As his father, I am very, very sorry and I did not expect this from my son.

'So he hasn't been apprehended? Oh Lord. Have mercy, God.

A witness saw a woman screaming, and running out of the spa towards traffic.

'She ran right out into the street (and) was pounding on cars,' David Gosh told The Journal Sentinel.

He then saw a man carrying a handgun run after her, and he was thought to be chasing after the woman.

The gunman then saw police beginning to gather and he ran back in the direction in which he came, and back into the spa.

'He was the shooter. He was looking for an escape route,' Mr Gosh said.

A witness told the Journal-Sentinel that a he saw a young girl running through a parking lot in a panic after her mother was reportedly shot.

'She was screaming, yelling, crying hysterical. She was pleading for help,' Christopher Pfeiffer told the local paper.

'She
kept saying, "My mother was shot." And she mentioned that there was a 
gunman. She ran into the bookstore and I followed her. But I watched her
from afar.'

According to the spa's website, it boasts that it is the largest salon and day spa in Brookfield with 9,000-square-feet.

The
layout of the spa- which has ten treatment rooms, male and female 
locker rooms, and a cafe area-complicates issues for police as people 
may be hiding inside.

The spa opened at 11am this morning and the shooting is thought to have begun shortly after.

Preparing: Police said that they are concerned that there may be explosives on the scene and have since ordered the bomb squad as a result

Tactical units: Police and swat team respondents entered the Azana Spa during the investigation

Ongoing: The shooter is thought to be on the loose and the neighboring mall is on lockdown as a result

The owner of the salon was out of the country at the time of the shooting and is reportedly headed back now.

This is the second mass shooting in the state in the past two months. An Army veteran opened fire at a Sikh temple in August, killing six people and injuring three others.

Local news reporters drew comparisons to
an earlier incident in 2005, when a shooting took place at the nearby 
Sheraton hotel during a mass service.

In that  shooting, seven people 
were killed before the shooter turned the gun on himself.
