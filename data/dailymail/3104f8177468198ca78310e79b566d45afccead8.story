Stoke City have opened talks over a possible summer deal for Evian flyer Daniel Wass.

The 25-year-old Denmark international is available for around £3.5million and has been watched by Chelsea, Liverpool and Newcastle over the past year as they look for versatile full back options.

Wass is quick and can play at right back, left back or either wing and has an eye for goal, often spectacular.

Schalke and Inter Milan have also shown interest but he is keen to try his luck in the Premier League and with Mark Hughes.

Hughes has been given licence to spend this summer and will look to add more pace to his side while working to secure a new contract for the likes of Asmir Begovic. 

He wants to make Victor Moses's transfer from Chelsea permanent and is interested in Lee Cattermole of Sunderland and Javier Hernandez of Manchester United.

Stoke scouts have also been monitoring Sporting Lisbon pair Islam Slimani and Andre Carrillo.
