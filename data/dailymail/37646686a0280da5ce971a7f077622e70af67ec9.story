One of the advantages of ageing is the right to do things your own way.

And having reached 90, it seems the Duke of Edinburgh is keen to exercise this privilege as much as possible.

Arriving for a rare private lunch at Downing Street yesterday, Prince Philip stood to one side as his wife efficiently stepped into position for an official photocall with the Prime Minister and his wife.

Samantha Cameron gently attempted to guide the Duke to his place in between her and the Queen, as the media advisers and spinmasters had wanted.

But independent Philip was having none of it and instead walked to the end of the line, on Mrs Cameron's right.

Reluctant to be the one to dissuade 
him, Mrs Cameron simply smiled for the cameras – as a slightly bemused 
Mr Cameron looked on. 

The four then made their way to the 
White Room to celebrate the Duke's recent birthday with Stilton and 
watercress tart, followed by Inverurie beef from Aberdeenshire and 
rounded off with peaches, nectarines and ice cream.

The Queen was said to have found the Prime Minister and his wife ‘delightful'.

The royal couple arrived in their 
Daimler Super Eight just after 1pm and as the car drove up the street 
two men on the roof of No 10 wearing hard hats and high visibility jackets raised
the Royal Standard.

Mrs Cameron curtseyed as she shook hands, first with the Queen and then with the Duke.

The Queen was wearing a green jacket over a floral dress and white gloves and Mrs Cameron was in a patterned white dress with green belt.

In good voice: The Queen led the nation in honouring St Paul's Cathedral, which came to symbolise Britain's Second World War defiance during the Blitz

A 15-year project completed this month is the first time the cathedral has been comprehensively restored inside and out.

It is the fourth building on the site and was designed by architect Sir Christopher Wren and built 
between 1675 and 1710 after its predecessor was destroyed in the Great 
Fire of London.

June 21 is a significant date for the cathedral as it marks the same day the first stone is believed to have been laid in 1675.

Despite the work finishing in 1710, Wren was handed his final payment on Christmas Day 1711 and when he died he was buried in the cathedral in a plain grave. It is marked with a Latin inscription written by his son that said: 'If you seek 
his monument, look around you'.

Over the centuries the cathedral has adapted to meet changing styles and needs with decorations being added and removed.

The impressive mosaics that cover the walls were the result of a 
complaint by Queen Victoria who had described the interior as 'most 
dreary, dingy and undevotional'.

The cathedral's famous dome is actually three in one - an outer 'skin', 
an ornately decorated inner structure seen by congregations and a brick 
cone between the two that supports the lantern on top of the building.

The restoration scheme has seen the once blackened and damaged west front returned to its former glory.

Other work included cleaning and repair of the interior, redesign and 
landscaping of the south churchyard gardens, restoration of the grand 
organ and adding wheelchair access to the crypt.

After pausing for a brief moment for 
photos Mr Cameron led the group into Number 10 where they tucked into a 
starter of Stilton and watercress tart, followed by Inverurie beef from 
Aberdeenshire, and a dessert of peaches and nectarines with ice cream.

It
is understood that the last time the royal couple visited Downing 
Street was in April 2002 for an event hosted by Tony and Cherie Blair.

Earlier this month, before the Duke became a nonagenarian on June 10, Mr Cameron spoke of the country's gratitude for his work.

The Prime Minister described him as a 'remarkable man who has given years of his service to our country, someone who has defended his nation in time of war, a man who has stood alongside Her Majesty the Queen for over six decades, a man who has given his time and effort and passion to so many great causes up and down the country, across the Commonwealth and indeed the world'.

The Queen and the Duke left Downing Street shortly before 2.30pm.

Mr Cameron stood with his arm around his wife's waist as they waved goodbye.

Earlier in the day the royal couple attended a service at St Paul's Cathedral to mark its 300th anniversary.

Sir Christopher Wren's masterpiece came to symbolise Britain's defiance during the Blitz and has played an important role in the spiritual life of the nation over the centuries.

It was the setting for the marriage of the Prince and Princess of Wales and for the funerals of Sir Winston Churchill, Lord Nelson and the Duke of Wellington.

It staged Jubilee celebrations for Queen Victoria, peace services marking the end of the First and Second World Wars and another commemorating the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001.

Its Dean, the Right Reverend Graeme Knowles, gave the sermon at the service, before a congregation including cathedral staff, volunteers and guides.

He said: 'What better monument could a man leave behind him, other than a cathedral, which has come to represent the presence of God at the heart of this amazing city?

'The much overworked word "iconic" has been used to describe the dome, and no one can fail to recognise its silhouette.

'The wartime photograph of the dome rising unscathed above the smoke and fire of the Blitz can be found anywhere.'

He added: 'But you will be surprised to hear, the one question visitors ask when they come through our door remains "so, do you still hold services here?" The question is usually asked incredulously.'

Earlier this month a £40 million project to clean and repair St Paul's was completed after 15 years.
