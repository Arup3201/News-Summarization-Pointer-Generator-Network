Ally McCoist was all smiles on Saturday as he watched Glasgow Warriors' beat Edinburgh at Scotstoun in the Guinness Pro 12.

Meanwhile, in the capital, Rangers were being thumped 4-0 by Hibernian in the Scottish Championship.

It didn't stop McCoist from enjoying the rugby, though, as the Warriors recorded a 16-6 win over their Scottish rivals.

The former Rangers boss was spotted at the game by former Scotland rugby international and Sportsmail columnist Andy Nicol.

'Highlight of day at Scotstoun was bumping into Ally McCoist. Great to see him smiling again!' Nicol Tweeted along with a picture of McCoist.

McCoist was placed on gardening leave by Rangers earlier this week after he had offered his resignation and triggered a 12 month's notice period.

McCoist and the board failed to reach an agreement on an early departure last week, raising the prospect of the manager hanging around to lead the team, despite working his notice.

But directors moved on Sunday night to remove the ‘lame duck coach’, agreeing to continue paying him the monthly instalments of his £750,000 salary to stay away — at least until they can finalise a settlement.

The 52-year-old's position at the club had become untenable after a series of poor results left Rangers 12 points behind league leaders Hearts in the race for promotion back to the Premiership.

Assistant manager Kenny McDowall was put in charge for the remainder of the season, according to a club statement, but his tenure got off to the worst possible start as Hibs swept Rangers aside at Easter Road.
