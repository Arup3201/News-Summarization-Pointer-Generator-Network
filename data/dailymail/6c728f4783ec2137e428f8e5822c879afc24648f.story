Pro-Russian rebels fighting in eastern Ukraine have announced plans to boost the size of their armed forces to 100,000 in a ominous sign for peace efforts in the war torn country.

Alexander Zakharchenko, the leader of separatists in the state of Donetsk, said new mobilization plans aim to swell the rebels' ranks, although its not clear exactly how many fighters the rebels have now, nor how many able-bodied men are still willing and able to join them in rebel-held areas.

The rebels have acknowledged that some Russian citizens are fighting among their ranks, but reject Ukraine's charge that they are getting military help from Russia. Western experts say the sheer amount of heavy weapons under rebel control shows extensive help from Moscow.

News of the rebels' recruitment drive comes as fierce protests broke out in the capital Kiev, with fighters from the Aydar Ukrainian volunteer battalion burning tyres at the entrance to the Ukrainian Defence Ministry during demonstrations prevent the possible disbandment of their battalion. The volunteers are furious at the possible scaling back of Ukrainian defence forces as regime groups are already outgunned in the east of the country.

This morning Ukrainian troops battled to repel waves of Russian-backed separatists trying to surround a strategic railway hub in eastern Ukraine.

Elsewhere, the rebel stronghold of Donetsk came under heavy, sustained shelling once again. City authorities said that 15 civilians had been killed over the weekend in the fighting, while Ukraine authorities said five soldiers had been killed and 29 wounded overall in the east in the past day alone.

Since the unrest in eastern Ukraine surged anew in early January, the separatists have made notable strides in clawing territory away from the government in Kiev. 

Their main offensive is now directed at Debaltseve - a government-held railway junction once populated by 25,000 people that lies between the rebel-held cities of Luhansk and Donetsk. Almost 2,000 residents have fled in the last few days alone.

Rebel forces have mounted multiple assaults on government positions in Debaltseve but all were repelled, a spokesman for Ukrainian military operations in the east, Andriy Lysenko, said today.

'The units that have arrived in support of our troops in Debaltseve are counterattacking and denying the enemy the opportunity to complete the encirclement,' he said.

Separatist fighters burst through Ukrainian lines last week in the village of Vuhlehirsk on the road west of Debaltseve, getting access to a ridge overlooking the highway running north from the town.

This morning Associated Press reporters saw Ukrainian tanks shooting from open fields at the tree line on that ridge. Minutes later, the tanks rolled back onto the highway, leaving a heavy trail of mud in their wake, and taking up new field positions a few hundred yards away.

In a coordinated defensive maneuver, Ukrainian forces fired barrages from Grad multiple-rocket launchers toward the same area.

Despite government's insistence it intends to retain control of Debaltseve, rows of trenches near a bridge 15 kilometers (9 miles) to the north suggested a backup plan in case the town falls.

Meanwhile, the leader of the separatists in Donetsk, Alexander Zakharchenko, said new mobilization plans aim to swell the ranks of rebels to 100,000 fighters.

It's not clear how many fighters the rebels have now or how many able-bodied men are still available in rebel areas. Zakharchenko did not say where he aimed to find apparently tens of thousands of troops.

'While we still have time before the spring, new detachments will be able to receive military training,' Zakharchenko said. 'We expect mobilization to yield at least five additional brigades - five motorized brigades, one artillery brigade and a tank brigade.'

In Budapest, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said her country will not provide weapons to Ukraine and supports negotiations and a diplomatic solution to the conflict.

'It is my firm belief that this conflict cannot be solved militarily,' Merkel said this morning. 

She said she prefers economic sanctions by the European Union and negotiations to 'solve or at least mitigate the conflict.'

The conflict in eastern Ukraine has claimed more than 5,100 lives and forced 900,000 to flee since April.

This afternoon a senior U.S. administration official claimed President Barack Obama is reconsidering sending lethal assistance to Ukraine but continues to have concerns about the effectiveness of that step and the risks of a proxy war between America and Russia.

The official said Obama is specifically concerned about the besieged Ukrainian military's capacity for using high-powered, American-supplied weaponry. The president has also argued that no amount of arming the Ukrainians would put them on par with Russia's military prowess.

The official requested anonymity to speak because the person was not authorized to talk publicly about internal deliberations.

The U.S. accuses Russia of supplying the pro-Kremlin separatists that are stirring instability in eastern Ukraine. The U.S. has limited its supplies to the Ukrainian military to non-lethal aid, such as gas masks and radar technology to detect incoming fire.

However, some administration officials have been pressing Obama for months to step up that assistance. With violence in eastern Ukraine on the rise in recent weeks, the official said Obama is willing to take a fresh look at supplying Ukraine with lethal aid, along with other options for calming tensions.

Secretary of State John Kerry is due to visit Kiev Thursday to meet with Ukrainian officials.

Obama and European leaders have largely centered their efforts to stop Russia's advances on Ukraine on sanctions targeting Moscow's most profitable economic sectors, as well as individuals close to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The sanctions, along with the plummeting price of oil, have hurt Russia's economy, but have done little to change Putin's calculus with regards to Ukraine.

Bernadette Meehan, spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council, said the White House is 'constantly assessing our policies in Ukraine.'

'Although our focus remains on pursuing a solution through diplomatic means,' she said, 'we are always evaluating other options that will help create space for a negotiated solution to the crisis.'

As fighting ntensified between government and rebel forces in Debaltseve, separatist leader Alexander Zakharchenko said that he plans to mobilize enough new volunteers to bring his forces to 100,000 men

Since the unrest in eastern Ukraine resumed, the separatists have made notable strides in clawing territory away from the government in Kiev

Since the crisis between Ukraine and Russia began early last year, the U.S.-led NATO alliance has sought to strengthen the Ukrainian military's command, control, communications and computers capabilities, as well as to improve logistics and standardization, cyber defense, military career transition and the rehabilitation of injured troops.

However, NATO officials have also stressed that the alliance has no military hardware of its own. Each of the 28 member nations is free to assist Ukraine as it deems fit.

Earlier today Alexander Vershbow, NATO's top-ranking American civilian official, said that Putin's actions have been a 'game-changer in European security,' and predicted the challenge from Moscow will be long-term. He said Russia was even less predictable now than during the Cold War.

'Today, we must contend with a Russia that wants to go back to a Europe based on spheres of influence and doctrines of limited sovereignty for its neighbors, policies that are a throwback to an earlier time, a time we thought we had put behind us,' Vershbow said in a speech prepared for delivery at the 2015 Leangkollen Conference in Oslo, Norway.

The New York Times first reported the new Obama administration deliberations on lethal assistance.
