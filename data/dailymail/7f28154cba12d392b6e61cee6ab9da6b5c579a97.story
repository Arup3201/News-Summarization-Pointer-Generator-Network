Britain's major cities are among the hardest in Europe to get around without a car, according to research.

London, Cardiff, Dublin, Edinburgh and Belfast were all in the bottom half of a 13-strong ease-of-travel city table released today.

Stockholm was judged to be the best European city to get around without a car, followed by Helsinki, Prague, Paris and Berlin.

Congested: London was in the bottom half of a list measuring ease of public transport use

But in the table compiled by the Campaign for Better Transport, London ranked eighth, Cardiff ninth, while Dublin, Edinburgh and Belfast were 10, 11, and 12 in the list respectively.

Only Rome, in 13th and last place, was deemed to be less 'green' and public transport-friendly than the UK's main cities.

The cities were judged on 16 categories, including ease of access to public transport, public attitudes to car use, congestion levels and the side effects from cars.

Busy: Edinburgh was second only to London for congestion

London had the worst air quality and congestion of all the cities examined in the study.

Londoners are also subjected to the highest fares.

Public transport in Cardiff was cheaper than in the other UK capitals, but the city had the second lowest number of public transport trips per day and the lowest number of people commuting by public transport.

Edinburgh was second only to London 
for congestion and worse than Rome or Paris.

Belfast finished bottom of 
all the UK capitals despite having the longest cycling and public 
transport networks.

CBT
chief executive Stephen Joseph said: 'Car dependency damages 
communities, affects our quality of life and has huge environmental 
consequences, so the UK cities' poor standing should be of major concern
to politicians.

'To 
catch up with the best in Europe the UK Governments need to recognise 
the economic benefits of good air quality and road safety, and ensure 
public transport, walking and cycling are comparable to car use in terms
of cost, journey time and quality.'
