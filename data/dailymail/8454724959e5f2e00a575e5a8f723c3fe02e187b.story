Speed cleaner: Aileen Hedges told police she used amphetamines to help 
her do the housework faster

A woman caught with a stash of 'speed' in her 
fridge told police she used it to help her do the housework 
faster.

When officers raided the Kent home of Aileen Hedges, 
30, she explained the 18.8g of amphetamine kept in the household appliance was just an 
aid to keeping the Gravesend property neat and tidy.

Police 
were also told by her that she had ‘no intention of supplying the drug’ and that she 
used the Class B narcotic - which gives users ‘rushes’ and is a 
‘performance enhancer’ - to help her clean her house at top speed.

A stash of cannabis was also found in the home, which she then explained she needed to ‘come down’ after doing 
all the cleaning and DIY.

Hedges, however, changed her story when 
she appeared at Maidstone Crown Court this week and admitting supplying 
speed and cannabis.

She told the court that she initially said
the class B drugs were for her own use as she was worried about being 
jailed for supplying drugs, but finally admitted the charges.

Bridget
Todd, prosecuting, told the court: 'She explained she took the 
amphetamine in order to do her housework, perhaps a little faster than 
she usually would.

'She was also doing some decorating and would then take the cannabis to come down.'

The
court heard how police found a string of text messages on Hedges’ 
mobile phone which the prosecutor said ‘indicated it was not merely for 
her own personal use and it went beyond social supply to friends’.

Hedges
was handed nine-months in jail, suspended for two years and ordered to 
take part in a six-month drug rehabilitation course after admitting 
supplying the drugs.

Speaking after her court case she said: 'I have never taken speed in my life.

'I
just said it because I have been done for drugs before and was worried 
about losing my house. I thought I would get it over and done with and 
just get a caution.

'But I then told the truth. I just wish I had put my hands up at the start.'
