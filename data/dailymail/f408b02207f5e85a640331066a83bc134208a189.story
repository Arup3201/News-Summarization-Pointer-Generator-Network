Militants fighting for the Islamic State terror group in northern Syria have mysteriously released 19 Christians hostages, local activists have revealed.

The members of Christian Assyrian community were among 220 people kidnapped by jihadis from a string of villages along the Khabur River in Hassakeh province last week.

The terrorists gave no explanation for why they had chosen to free the 19 men and three women, who were packed on a bus in the ISIS-held town of Shaddadeh, and arrived safely  at the Church of the Virgin Mary in the nearby city of Hassakeh yesterday afternoon.

The news provided a modicum of relief to a Christian Assyrian community that has been devastated by the abductions. But fears remain over the fate of the hundreds still held captive. 

The unexplained release is reminiscent of ISIS' freeing of 200 elderly  Yazidi community members near Kirkuk in Iraq in January, which came after the hostages had been held for several months.

Safe: 19 men and three women were packed on a bus in the ISIS-held town of Shaddadeh and arrived safely at the Church of the Virgin Mary in the nearby city of Hassakeh yesterday afternoon

Release at last: News of the release provided a modicum of relief to a Christian Assyrian community that has been devastated by the abductions. But fears remain over the fate of the hundreds still held captive

Captured: The Assyrian Human Rights Network reported the release of the 19 Christians and later published these photographs on its Facebook page

It is not immediately clear why the Islamic State group freed these captives but not more than 200 others

Both Bashir Saedi, a senior official in the Assyrian Democratic Organization, and the Assyrian Human Rights Network reported the release of the 19 Christians.

The later published photographs on its Facebook page that it said were taken in Hassakeh and appeared to show a crowd of people dressed in winter coats greeting the returnees.

The photos appeared genuine, according to the Associated Press news agency.

It was not immediately clear why the Islamic State group freed these captives.

Saedi said all those released were around 50 years of age or older, which suggests age might have been a factor.

The Assyrian Human Rights Network, meanwhile, said the captives had been ordered released by a Shariah court after paying an unspecified amount of money levied as a tax on non-Muslims

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also said a Shariah court had ruled the captives be freed, but the reasoning behind the decision was unknown

The Assyrian Human Rights Network, meanwhile, said the captives had been ordered released by a Shariah court after paying an unspecified amount of money levied as a tax on non-Muslims.

Known as a jizya, the tax effectively forces Jew and Christians - so-called 'People of the Book' - to either pay a regular sum of protection money to the jihadis, or otherwise choose between forced conversion to Islam or brutal execution.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also said a Shariah court had ruled the captives be freed, but the reasoning behind the decision was unknown.

The fate of the more than 200 other Christian Assyrians still in ISIS' hands remains unclear.

Most of those kidnapped are believed to have been taken by fighters to Shaddadeh, located 30 miles south of Hassakeh.

Assyrian leaders and Sunni tribal sheikhs have begun reaching out to ISIS to try to negotiate the release of the captives, activists said.

'We're trying to contact any party that might help. We're working through our friends the tribal sheikhs,' said Younan Talia, a senior official in the Assyrian Democratic Organization. 

'Some friends of Daesh are trying to send messages.'

Talia said there has been no response yet. Daesh is an Arabic acronym for the Islamic State group.

The Sweden-based director of the Assyrian Network for Human Rights in Syria, Osama Edward, also said efforts were underway to try to negotiate the captives' release.

The abductions have added to fears among religious minorities in both Syria and Iraq, who have been repeatedly targeted by the Islamic State group. 

During the militants' bloody campaign in both countries, where they have declared a self-styled caliphate, minorities have been repeatedly targeted and killed, driven from their homes, had their women enslaved and places of worship destroyed.

Militants fighting for the Islamic State in Syria have released sickening footage of the murder of a man the terror group accused of working as a spy.

The video was filmed in  Aleppo and shows a man believed to be named Ahmed Muhammad being led out to a forecourt by masked executioners, who then shoot him in the head multiple times at point blank range.

In a chilling sign of ISIS' reach and influence, Muhammad is understood to have been accused of working as part of a secret spy network based in neighbouring NATO member state Turkey before his brutal filmed execution over the border in Syria.

Murder: A militant shoots Ahmed Muhammad once in the back of the head, before standing over him and firing several more bullets into his neck once he lies prone on the grass

Titled 'A Lesson To Be Learned', the three minute 40 second video has all the hallmarks of an official ISIS release - employing HD cameras, Hollywood-style sound and visual effects and slick editing and direction. 

The sickening film is reminiscent of the gruesome video showing the burning to death of Jordanian pilot Muath al-Kaseasbeh, in that it begins with a lengthy interview with the orange-jumpsuit wearing victim speaking while sat at a table in a darkened room.

Muhammad is seen giving details of the charges against him, which are understood to relate to accusations he was working as part of a spy network over the border in southern Turkey.

Led to his death: Once the Arabic-language interview scene inside the building is completed, Muhammad is then seen walking in a hunched position across a courtyard
