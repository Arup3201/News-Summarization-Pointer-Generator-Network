The pilot of a medical transport helicopter narrowly avoided a collision with an unmanned drone near a Pennsylvania airport on Wednesday, a hospital official said.

A Life Flight helicopter was crossing over the Schuylkill County Joe Zerbey Airport, about 50 miles west of Allentown, when it nearly crossed paths with a drone flying in the same airspace.

WBRE reports the drone was operating about 1000 feet above the ground at the time of the incident, though it did not describe how the helicopter evaded the unmanned aircraft.

There were no patients aboard the helicopter at the time, a Geisinger Health System spokesperson told the station.

The pilot of the helicopter reached out to drone enthusiast Lee DeAngelis to ask about protocol among operators of unmanned aircraft.

'His main concern used to be birds, now it's drones,' DeAngelis says about the Life Flight pilot involved in  the incident.

DeAngelis posts videos shot using drones to Access Aerial, a site for fans of the technology.

He says he 'self-regulates' to avoid incidents such as the one that happened Wednesday, steering clear of airports and speaking with authorities ahead of flights.

The station reports the Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the incident, but as for the helicopter pilot, DeAngelis says the close call hasn't turned him off drones for good.

'He likes the technology and thinks it could be used for good, he's just amazed at how quickly these things have shown up on his radar,' said DeAngelis.
