Matt Derbyshire inspired relegation-threatened Rotherham as they made a mockery of current Championship form with their most comprehensive win of the season.

The Yorkshire club came into the contest with just one victory in 15 matches and engulfed by local chit-chat that their manager Steve Evans was under pressure.

But they played with a freedom of expression that belied their status a place above the drop zone as Neil Lennon’s Wanderers came crashing down to earth 72 hours after negating Liverpool at Anfield.

Indeed, Bolton were plunging towards only their second defeat in any competition since October as early as the second minute when former Newcastle midfielder Conor Newton marked his full Rotherham debut by picking out Ben Pringle, who connected with an unstoppable far-post volley.

It was one of three goals before the interval as Lennon was left seething on the touchline.

The home team’s second midway through the half, like the first, was created down the right as Derbyshire exploited the space behind wing-back Andy Kellett to fire in a cross-shot from the edge of the box – Bolton goalkeeper Andy Lonergan could only parry and Conor Sammon tapped in his first goal of a loan spell from Derby.

Bolton dominated the rest of the period after Lennon re-shaped to a 4-4-2 formation but were left fuming when referee Darren Drysdale dismissed claims for a penalty when Josh Vela was tripped.

In fact, the water bottle booted by Lennon was still in motion when Derbyshire completed a stunning counter-attack by clipping onto the head of Paul Green, whose glanced finish went in off the post.

Although it was all over bar the shouting, Rotherham saved their best for a dozen minutes after the re-start as Derbyshire skirted the fringe of the area before arrowing a left-footed drive beyond Lonergan.

Further tinkering by Lennon followed and Bolton played the final stages with their captain Matt Mills employed as a makeshift striker.

His physicality made an impression too as Wanderers struck twice inside the final quarter hour.

First, substitute Liam Trotter burst from midfield to prod past Adam Collin.

Then, Mills popped up to force a close-range header past Collin to offer the travelling support brief hope of a dramatic conclusion.

But Rotherham held on for their first win at the New York Stadium for more than three months to open up a five-point buffer between them and the Championship drop zone.
