A gang of scrap metal thieves have stolen 120ft of track from a volunteer run miniature railway. 

The thieves lifted the track from a miniature railway circling the 450-acre Mote Park in Maidstone, Kent.

They then loaded it into a truck and speeding off in the early hours of Wednesday.

Bosses at the Maidstone Model Engineering Society, which operates the railway - which costs 20p-per-ride - were horrified when they turned up to find a huge section of the track ripped up.

Police are hunting a gang of scrap metal thieves after they pinched 120ft of track from the miniature railway

The ride has been running for decades and is run by volunteers from the society - which was set up in 1929.

A spokesman for the Society said this week that it was ‘horrified’ at the theft and pleaded with witnesses to come forward.

He said: 'Members of the Club were upset and horrified to discover over 120 feet of our railway track in Mote Park has been ripped up and stolen. 

'If you walk through the park please keep your eyes open for us as possibly someone might have seen something.

'Although of little value, there will be a lot of work required by the members, who are all volunteers, in replacing the stolen rails.'

He added: 'All the work is done by club members who are volunteers, and the majority of the locomotives are built by them, a labour of love sometimes taking many years. 

'We enjoy sharing our hobby giving rides on Sunday afternoons to all generations and hopefully this will continue for many, many more years.

'We will aim to run some sort of train service giving rides this Sunday if we possibly can, as we do not want to disappoint anyone.

'We will do our best to get back to normal as soon as we can. Please bear with us through this difficult period, your support is valued.'

Local Jonnie Jensen said: 'Stealing the track from the Mote Park model railway. 120 feet of it!

'I was here about three weeks ago and the kids loved it and families queued to have a go - whoever did this were total scumbags.'

Another Tony Henderson, 34, said: 'This ride has been going for years and now it’s ruined by a bunch of morons trying to make a bit of money from selling off the metal.

'They have ruined it for everyone, especially the kids who love the ride.'

A spokesman for Kent Police said if was investigating the theft and appealed for witnesses to come forward.
