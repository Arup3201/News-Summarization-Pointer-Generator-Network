A college has banned pupils from going to the toilet on their own during exams in a bid to stop them cheating on their smartphones.

Solihull Sixth Form College, in the West Midlands, said teenagers sitting mock exams later this month will have to be accompanied to the toilet block by an invigilator, and they will not be allowed to close the cubicle door.

Principal Paul Ashdown admitted that the decision was 'extreme' but said students had been caught cheating with mobile phones during toilet breaks in exams last year.

The move has been condemned by angry parents, with one saying: 'This would be degrading to anyone - let alone to kids of 16 and 17.

'It is a clear disregard for basic human rights and is downright wrong.'

In an e-mail to parents informing them of the school's decision, Mr Ashdown said: 'We have had students attempt to cheat using phones while on toilet breaks during an exam.

'This means that from now on, if a student does require a toilet break during an exam, they will be accompanied into the toilet area by an invigilator of the appropriate sex, and will not be allowed to close the door if they need to use an individual stall.

'Although this may seem a little extreme, it is the only way we can ensure a student does not use a mobile phone while in the toilet.

'Ideally, students should ensure they do not need to break their concentration by going to the toilet in the middle of the exam.

'I know I can rely on you for support with these security measures.'

The college has taken drastic action over fears pupils will cheat on exams by looking up the answers on their smartphones while hidden away in the toilet. The principle said it follows cheating last year (file pictures)

The new rule will come into force when mock AS and A2 exams take place later this month.

Mr Ashdown said the crackdown was an attempt to 'protect the future chances of our students'.

He said: 'The college is implementing this toilet breaks policy during examinations to make students aware that attempting to cheat is simply not worth it.

'A very small minority of students attempt to cheat and they use increasingly inventive and sophisticated techniques, including using mobile phones smuggled into the toilets.

'However, the consequences of cheating are very severe because students will find themselves disqualified from that exam by the exam board, and possibly even disqualified from all their other exams too.

'We are protecting the future chances of our students by implementing strict security measures.

'The majority of students will not need to use the toilet during an exam, but if they do, our experienced invigilator team will supervise closely, but sensitively, to ensure that no cheating takes place.'
