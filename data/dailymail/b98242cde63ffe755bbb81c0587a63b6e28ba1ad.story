Chelsea vs Hull City (Stamford Bridge)

Team news 

Chelsea

Goalkeeper Petr Cech will make his first Barclays Premier League start of the season against Hull on Saturday after Thibaut Courtois suffered a minor injury in training.

Playmaker Cesc Fabregas will serve a one-match suspension as Jose Mourinho reverts to the majority of his first-choice line-up.

Defender John Terry and forwards Eden Hazard and Willian were rested for the midweek defeat of Sporting Lisbon, which saw Mourinho make six changes to the side which lost for the first time this season last weekend at Newcastle.

Provisional squad: Cech, Ivanovic, Luis, Fabregas, Zouma, Ramires, Oscar, Hazard, Drogba, Mikel, Schurrle, Salah, Remy, Costa, Matic, Willian, Cahill, Terry, Azpilicueta, Schwarzer, Beeney, Loftus-Cheek, Christensen.

Gaston Ramirez has completed a three-game ban, but fellow loanee Hatem Ben Arfa is set to continue his exile from the squad.

Provisional squad: McGregor, Jakupovic, Davies, Rosenior, Robertson, Chester, Dawson, Bruce, Elmohamady, Meyler, Huddlestone, Livermore, Brady, Aluko, Quinn, Ramirez Hernandez, Aluko, Jelavic

The Tigers have never won away at Chelsea in any competition (L15 D5 W0).

Chelsea are unbeaten in their last 10 games against Hull City in all competitions (W8 D2), including all six in the Barclays Premier League (W4 D2 L0).

Cesc Fabregas (81) is now clear in sixth place in the all time Premier League assist ranking; one ahead of David Beckham (80).

Allan McGregor has saved all three of the penalties he has faced in the Premier League – no goalkeeper has ever saved four consecutive penalties that he’s faced in the competition.

Only once before have Chelsea had more points after 15 games of a Premier League campaign (40 in 2005-06).
