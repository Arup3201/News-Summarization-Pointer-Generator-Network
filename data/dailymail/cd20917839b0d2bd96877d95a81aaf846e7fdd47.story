Sheffield United will enter the second leg of their Capital One Cup semi-final hoping to add Tottenham Hotspur to their lengthening list of Premier League scalps in knockout competition.

Since manager Nigel Clough took over in October 2013, the Blades have developed a reputation as Cup fighters and have already beaten Aston Villa, Fulham, West Ham, Southampton and QPR in the last 12 months or so.

In order to eliminate Spurs and claim their place in the final at Wembley, United will have to overturn a 1-0 first leg deficit.

But, given their track record, you wouldn't bet against them causing yet another upset in front of a raucous Bramall Lane crowd on Wednesday night.

We take a look back at the occasions when Clough's underdogs have sent the big boys packing.

ASTON VILLA 1 SHEFFIELD UNITED 2

FA Cup third round; January 4, 2014

Villa manager Paul Lambert had been outspoken before this third round tie that the FA Cup was an unwanted distraction. The Blades clearly didn't share the sentiment.

They stunned a lethargic home side after 20 minutes when Jamie Murphy's shot took a deflection of Ciaran Clark and deceived goalkeeper Jed Steer.

The Premier League hosts levelled with 15 minutes to play when a hopeful long ball ricocheted around the penalty area and Nicklas Helenius fired home.

But just as it looked as though Villa were gaining the upper hand, Ryan Flynn cut inside from the right and sent an unstoppable left-footed strike into the top corner to send 6,000 travelling fans into dreamland.

Defeated by a Blades side who at that point were a mere point above the relegation zone in League One, it came as little surprise that Villa were booed off.

FULHAM 0 SHEFFIELD UNITED 1

(after extra time)

FA Cup fourth round replay; February 4, 2014

United's 'reward' for knocking out Villa was another tie with Premier League opposition in relegation-threatened Fulham.

After a 1-1 draw at Bramall Lane, in which 10-man United had held out when Hugo Rodallega equalised Chris Porter's first-half opener, it was back to Craven Cottage for the replay.

And, after an extremely tedious 120 minutes in pouring rain, the League One side again upset the odds thanks to Shaun Miller's dramatic last-gasp header.

With a penalty shoot-out looming, Miller stooped at the back post to flick in Harry Maguire's towering header from a corner and sent 2,500 travelling fans into raptures.

WEST HAM UNITED 1 SHEFFIELD UNITED 1

(after extra time, Sheffield United won 5-4 on penalties)

Capital One Cup second round; August 26, 2014

The Blades eventually reached the FA Cup semi-finals, losing 5-3 to Hull at Wembley. But a new season gave Clough's men plenty more opportunity for giant-killing acts.

They returned to London to take on West Ham in the second round of the Capital One Cup and once again it was a dramatic night to remember.

Diafra Sakho headed the Hammers into the lead five minutes before the break, but Winston Reid diverted a cross into his own net to gift a second-half equaliser.

Neither side could claim a winner in extra time and when Enner Valencia's penalty was saved by Mark Howard, Michael Doyle converted to send United through.

It was a small but sweet measure of revenge for 2007, when the Blades were relegated from the Premier League, largely thanks to Carlos Tevez's exploits for West Ham.

It was later discovered that West Ham broke rules on third-party ownership by signing the Argentina international.

SHEFFIELD UNITED 1 SOUTHAMPTON 0

Capital One Cup quarter-final; December 16, 2014

After seeing off Leyton Orient and MK Dons, the Blades were drawn at home to Premier League high-flyers Southampton in the last eight.

Ronald Koeman's team struggled to get to grips with the Bramall Lane atmosphere and the direct approach of Clough's team and the pressure eventually told.

On 63 minutes, Bob Harris drove a free-kick through a wall of Saints players, goalkeeper Fraser Forster fumbled and Marc McNulty poked the ball home.

To compound Southampton's misery, Florin Gardos was shown a red card late on.

'It is an incredible night for the club,' said Clough. 'I thought we deserved the victory, we created more chances and the only disappointment was that we should have had another goal.'

QUEENS PARK RANGERS 0 SHEFFIELD UNITED 3

FA Cup third round; January 4, 2015

With a Capital One Cup semi-final with Spurs to look forward to, the Blades turned their attentions to more giant-killing exploits in the FA Cup.

Having seen off Crewe and Plymouth, United were drawn away to Queens Park Rangers in the third round at Loftus Road.

With Harry Redknapp's team struggling in the Premier League, United sniffed an upset but few could believe the three-goal margin of victory.

Marc McNulty scored the opener on 36 minutes, rounding off a swift counter-attack with a close-range finish.

Jamal Campbell-Rice then capitalised on defensive lapses twice after the break to complete another memorable win.
