A man has been charged with the murder of his girlfriend who went missing more than a week ago, it was revealed today.

Grandmother Pamela Jackson, 55, was last seen on March 2 at her home in Chester-le-Street, County Durham, and was reported missing last Thursday.

Officers are still hunting for her, although the case has become a murder inquiry.

Today, police revealed Adrian Muir, 50, from 
Halifax, West Yorkshire, was charged in connection with her death. He is expected to appear before magistrates in Consett, County Durham, this afternoon.

Detectives looking for her had said yesterday they have 'genuine reason to suspect she may have come to harm'.

Muir was taken into custody in Chester-le-Street in connection 
with the search last night and was quizzed at Durham police 
office.

More than 40 officers and specialist police staff are now working on the inquiry.

Mrs Jackson, who is also known as Cris or Crissie, was reported missing on Thursday evening after her son, Joe, 21, became concerned.

A Durham Police spokesman said there has been no definite sighting of her since Saturday March 2 when she was last seen at her home.

He said there has been no activity on her mobile phone for several days and her Facebook page has also not been updated in the same time.

Detective Superintendent Ken Donnelly said: 'Our main focus is on finding Pamela and we have a number of actions to follow up in our continuing search for her.

'However, the enquiries we have carried out so far give us genuine reason to suspect she may have come to harm, and for that reason we have made an arrest and we have a man in custody, helping us with our enquiries.'

Mrs Jackson does not drive and does not work due to health issues. She also has two other adult sons, Andrew and Christopher, police said.

The grandmother is described as petite and is 5ft tall, slim and with very long, black hair which is usually straight.

She has a black rose tattoo to the upper right arm and large Celtic style letters to the upper left arm and usually wears what is described as vintage-style clothing with rings and costume jewellery.
