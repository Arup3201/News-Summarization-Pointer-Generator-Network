More women than ever are starting to smoke as earlier in life, say scientists

Women are increasingly starting to smoke at younger ages, according to a large international study which found 'alarming patterns' of tobacco use.

While the study, published in The Lancet medical journal, found male smokers far outnumbered females in the 16 countries surveyed, women were picking up the habit earlier.

'Many factors contribute to these changes, including the targeting of tobacco products to
women via multiple media outlets, such as the cinema, and cigarette designs that ease the transition from experimentation to established use,' they wrote.

'Low prices and absence of effective counter-marketing campaigns also contribute to high rates of uptake.'

The study also found two fifths of men in developing countries still smoke or use tobacco and that these countries had low quit rates.

There are wide differences in the 
rates of smoking between genders and nations, as well as major 
disparities in access to effective anti-smoking treatments.

'Although 1.1 billion people have 
been covered by the adoption of the most effective tobacco control 
policies since 2008, 83 percent of the world's population are not 
covered by two or more of these policies,' said study leader Gary 
Giovino of the University at Buffalo in New York.

Measures
include legislation banning smoking in public places, imposing 
advertising bans and requiring more graphic health warnings on cigarette
packets.

The findings come as the world's leading tobacco firms, British American Tobacco, Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a crucial legal appeal in Australia this week against the introduction of plain tobacco packaging.

Australia's planned 'no logo' laws are in line with World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations and are being watched closely by Britain, Norway, New Zealand, Canada and India, which are considering similar measures.

Tobacco kills up to half of its users, according to the WHO.

Smoking causes lung cancer, often fatal, and other chronic respiratory diseases. It is also a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, the world's number one killers. Other forms of tobacco use include snuff or chewing tobacco.

Proportion of adults aged 15 years or older who currently smoke cigarettes and other tobacco products

Matthew L. Myers, president of the 
U.S.-based Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said the study 'underscores 
the enormity of the global tobacco epidemic'.

'Without
urgent action, tobacco use will claim 1 billion lives this century,' he
said, urging poorer countries to 'act now and address a crisis they can
ill afford.'Using data 
from Global Adult Tobacco Surveys (GATS) carried out between 2008 and 
2010, Giovino's team compared patterns of tobacco use and cessation in 
people aged 15 or older from 14 low- and middle-income countries. They 
included data from Britain and the United States for comparison.

They
found disproportionately high rates of smoking among men - at an 
average 41 per cent versus 5 per cent in women - and wide variation in 
smoking prevalence, ranging from about 22 per cent of men in Brazil to 
more than 60 per cent in Russia.

Rates
of female smoking ranged from 0.5 percent in Egypt to almost 25 percent
in Poland. Women in Britain and the United States also had high smoking
rates, at 21 percent and 16 percent respectively.

The
study found that around 64 percent of tobacco users smoke manufactured 
cigarettes, although loose-leaf chewing tobacco and snuff were 
particularly common in India and Bangladesh.With
an estimated 301 million tobacco users, China has more than any other 
country, closely followed by India with almost 275 million. Other 
countries included in the study were Bangladesh, Mexico, Philippines, 
Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, Uruguay and Vietnam. The researchers said the
rise in tobacco use among young women was of particular concern.In
a commentary about the study also published in The Lancet, Jeffrey 
Koplan from Emory University in the United States and Judith Mackay from
the World Lung Foundation in Hong Kong called for more investment in 
tobacco control measures, saying current under-funding was 
"extraordinary".

In low income countries, they said, for every $9,100 received in tobacco taxes, only $1 was spent on tobacco control.

The
WHO says tobacco already kills around 6 million people a year 
worldwide, including more than 600,000 non-smokers who die from exposure
to second-hand smoke.

By 2030, if current trends continue, it predicts tobacco could kill 8 million people a year.
