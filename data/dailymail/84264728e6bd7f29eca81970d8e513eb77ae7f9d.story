Hockey's biggest star, Sidney Crosby, has been stricken with the mumps - one at least 20 players who came down with highly infectious virus in the last few weeks. 

The National Hockey League is struggling to contain the spread of the illness, which is usually not dangerous to healthy adults but is incredibly contagious. Players on at least six teams have missed games after being infected. 

Crosby appeared in front of reporters on Friday with one side of his face swollen - a telltale sign of the mumps. 

The Penguins said an earlier mumps test turned up negative and that they thought the swelling was the result of an injury.

Team doctors believed the swelling in Crosby's face was due to an injury. He will miss at least three days as the virus runs its course

Crosby's Pittsburgh Penguins teammate Beau Bennett  has come down with a suspected case of the mumps just days after he visited sick kids at a children's hospital with his team.

Bennett is being tested for the virus and doctors fear he may have exposed the children, many of whom have compromised immune systems, to the virulent illness.

At least one child at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh has been quarantined. 

Crosby will miss at least three games before he is allowed to return to the ice, according to ESPN. 

Players from the New York Rangers, New Jersey Devils, Minnesota Wild, Anaheim Ducks and St Louis Blues are believed to have come down with the virus. 

An infected person can be contagious for weeks before showing signs of the illness - which includes swelling of the salivary glands, fatigue, muscle aches and fever. 

Mumps, which is usually associated with childhood illness, spreads by coming in contact with an infected person's saliva. 

And the NHL outbreak is particularly troubling because it has been able to spread despite recent vaccinations.

Crosby, whose mumps results were confirmed on Monday, received a booster shot of the vaccine last year before he traveled to Russia for the Olympics, team officials said. 

Other players who were infected had gotten booster shots this year.  

Hockey is an ideal environment for mumps to spread. It's a full-contact sport where players share towels and water bottles.

League officials are offering booster shots and vaccinations to players, team officials and referees, They are also educating players about how the disease is spread and working to eliminate the sharing of water bottles and other objects that can spread the virus.
