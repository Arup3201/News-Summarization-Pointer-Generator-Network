This is the moment a groom was arrested and led away in handcuffs just minutes before he was due to get married in an alleged sham wedding.

Two Indian nationals, the groom and a witness, were arrested by officers from the Home Office Immigration Enforcement team at the ceremony at Swindon Register office, in Wiltshire.

The pair were suspected of being in the country illegally and are now being detained while steps are being taken to have them removed.

The 22-year-old groom was set to marry a 19-year-old Estonian woman at the ceremony.

But before the couple could exchange vows officers swooped and arrested those involved.

The would-be-bride was questioned by police officers and later released.

Immigration Minister Mark Harper said: 'We are determined to stop migrants abusing the marriage system to cheat immigration rules.

'The gangs involved in this criminal activity often have links to serious organised crime, and prey on some of society's most vulnerable people.

'Measures outlined in the Immigration Bill include extending the marriage and civil penalty notice period to 28 days in England and Wales, and 70 days in some circumstances.

'This will give our officers and registrars more time to investigate, prosecute and remove those attempting to stage sham marriages.'

On Friday MailOnline reported how a 27-year-old Pakistani man was arrested moments before he was to wed a 25-year-old Czech woman at a registry office located in King Georgeâ€™s Hall, Blackburn, Lancashire.

The Home Office said two immigration enforcement officers, acting on information the relationship may not be genuine, arrived at the venue 10.30am on Thursday - just as the ceremony was about to take place.

The man was arrested and checks revealed he was in the country illegally having over-stayed his student visa.

The woman he had been due to marry was interviewed by officers and later released.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
