This is the heart-stopping moment a bungling hitman's clumsiness saved the life of his helpless victim - after the would-be killer ran out of bullets as he stood over his target.

Suspect Michele Morelli's bad luck turned out to be a blessing for Michele Di Bari, 31, as he stared at the barrel of the handgun thinking his life was about to end.

But as the would-be killer pulled the trigger, it simply clicked over and over - leaving him no option but to turn and flee.

Morelli, 24, was eventually captured after detectives got hold of CCTV footage showing a suspected hitman scarpering from the scene.

It is the latest in a series of murders and attempted murders this month that are so far believed to be linked to the mafia.

Di
 Bari, a car salesman, can be seen begging for his life as renowned 
crook Morelli stands over him in a deserted street in the southern 
Italian town of Foggia.

Although the district is prime territory of the local mafia, known as the Sacra Corona Unita, police believe it was a personal vendetta.

The film begins with Morelli cycling down a street and his victim standing in between two parked cars.

A few minutes later, Di Bari is seen running along the street being chased by the gunman who is firing wildly at him, hitting several parked cars and missing his target.Â

Eventually one bullet strikes Di Bari in the leg causing him to crash to the floor on a corner.

A man said to be Morelli approaches and stands over him as his target begs for his life.

Aiming at his head, he coldly pulls the trigger several times. But after his six failed shots earlier, he has run out of bullets so he simply turns and runs off.

Di Bari is seen writhing in agony before a camera further up the street again picks up Morelli running away - leaving his victim in agony, but still alive.

Paramedics were quick to the scene and an ambulance took him to a local hospital for treatment to a serious leg wound.

Police recovered several bullets which had struck parked cars and Morelli was arrested days later.

He is now in custody accused of attempted murder and illegal possession of a firearm.

He is known to police and has minor convictions. Beyond his own criminal activity, Morelli was the victim of an attempted murder four years ago.

Michele Pucci, head of Foggia Flying Squad, said: 'Di Bari can consider himself a very lucky man indeed.

'The footage clearly shows just how close he came to being killed - he certainly had a guardian angel or some divine protection that day because he could very well be dead now. It was a miracle escape for him.

'Morelli was using a small handgun, 7.65 calibre, and had fired six times at Di Bari, all of the bullets except one hit parked cars and missed him but one did catch him in the leg, leaving him with a serious injury.

'Luck was smiling on Di Bari. But not Morelli as we eventually caught up with him and arrested him after he was recognised from the footage.'

The motive for the shooting is still unclear as Di Bari and Morelli have both refused to speak to police.

Investigators believe it could possibly be over a car sale, drugs or territorial rivalry.
