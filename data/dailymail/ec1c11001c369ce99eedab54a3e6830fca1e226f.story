It was a wild roller-coaster ride on Wall Street Wednesday as US stocks plunged in afternoon trading before recovering some of the losses at the close. 

Investors dumped risky assets in heavy trading and parked their money in investments seen as relatively safe, such as US government bonds.

The Dow Jones industrial average dropped as much as 460 points in afternoon trading, then clawed back much of the ground it lost. It ended down 173 points, or 1.1 per cent, at 16,141.

The Standard & Poor's 500 fell 15 points, or 0.8 per cent, to 1,862. The Nasdaq fell 11 points, or 0.3 per cent, to 4,215.

A late-afternoon recovery erased much of the historic losses. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are now slightly higher for the year. 

The about-face came just hours after both the Dow and the S&P experienced the worst mid-day trading in nearly three years as investor fears of a global economic slowdown intensified after several weeks of turbulent market action, exacerbated by growing concerns over the ongoing Ebola outbreak.

The Dow plunged as much as 460 points following steep declines in Europe as investors sized up the latest batch of corporate earnings and some discouraging US economic news. The Dow was heading for its biggest percentage drop since June 2013.

The drop was also the index's largest mid-day loss since September 22, 2011, when the Dow shed 552 points. 

Traders dumped risky assets and parked their money in investments seen as relatively safe, such as US government bonds. That pushed the yield on the 10-year Treasury note briefly below 2 per cent, the lowest level in more than a year.

'It's a function of the US being the best house in a bad neighborhood,' said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. 'There's still uncertainty about economic growth, primarily on a global basis."

The Dow recovered some of the ground it had lost in the first half-hour of trading then fell steadily again through the afternoon before inching back up by the time the closing bell sounded. 

Bond prices soared as investors shifted money into safe-haven investments.

Early on, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note plunged to 1.91 per cent from 2.20 per cent the day before, or 29 basis points, a huge move. It recovered to 2.01 per cent in afternoon trading. Bond yields fall when their prices rise.

Downward spiral: The Dow plunged as much as 460 points, heading for its biggest percentage drop since June 2013.

Bad day: By 3pm Wednesday, the Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 43 points, or 2.3 per cent, to 1,834

'It typically takes weeks for 10-year Treasurys to move 29 basis points,' noted Tom Di Galoma, head of fixed income rates in New York at ED&F Man Capital. 'Today it moved 29 basis points in 5 minutes.'

Wednesday's slide brings the stock market closer to a correction, which happens when a benchmark index like the S&P 500 falls 10 per cent or more from a recent peak.

The S&P 500 hit its most recent peak of 2,011.36 on September 18. It would have to close at 1,810.22 to mark a correction. The last time that happened was October 2011.

The correction threshold for the Dow is 15,551. The Nasdaq's is 4,138. The Nasdaq traded below that threshold on Wednesday and could match the widely accepted definition of being in a correction if it closes below that point.

Parts of the market are already in correction, which has some analysts calling for caution. Small-company stocks, as measured by the Russell 2000 index, have fallen 12.8 per cent since hitting a peak in July and are down 9.5 per cent for the year.

Many market watchers say occasional corrections are a healthy phenomenon over the long term and give investors an opportunity to add to their holdings at a lower cost.

'That's why it' so important to stay invested at a time like this, rather than think it's a time to get out,' said Kate Warne, an investment strategist at Edward Jones.

Jittery: Investor fears of a global economic slowdown intensified after several weeks of turbulent market action, exacerbated by growing concerns over the ongoing Ebola outbreak

Stocks have been declining for nearly a month as investors have grown increasingly nervous about whether global growth is slowing. While the US economy remains in recovery mode, investors are concerned that corporate earnings growth will slow this year and next due to a slowdown in Europe and, to a lesser degree, China.

Investors got more discouraging news early Wednesday, when the Commerce Department reported that retail sales declined 0.3 per cent in September from the previous month. Purchases of autos, gasoline, furniture and clothing slowed.

Retail sales have risen 4.3 per cent over the past 12 months, slightly below their historical pace.

A snapshot of manufacturing activity didn't bolster optimism.

The Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Empire State Manufacturing index dropped sharply from 27.5 to 6.2 in October as new orders shrank and shipments barely rose. The latest reading marks the slowest pace of growth in six months.

All 10 sectors in the S&P 500 declined, led by financial stocks, which slid 3.6 per cent.

KeyCorp, Regions Financial, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup were among the biggest decliners. Covidien led the slide among S&P 500 companies, falling $8.36, or 9.1 per cent, to $83.96.

Bucking the trend were several energy companies, including Cabot Oil & Gas, Southwest Energy and EQT Corp. Cabot paced the gainers, rising 95 cents, or 3.3 percent, to $29.43.

Several homebuilders surged, getting a lift from the slide in the 10-year Treasury bond yield, which affects rate on consumer and business loans. A decline in the 10-year Treasury note yield should nudge mortgage rates lower, spurring home sales.

M/I Homes got the biggest boost among the builders, adding 43 cents, or 2.2 per cent, to $19.65.

As more companies report earnings over the next couple of weeks, investors should get a better read of the impact that the economic situation overseas will have on US companies. 

US crude oil slipped 23 cents to $81.61 a barrel.
