It could be days before Australian Tahnia Cook hears from her husband, Cameron, who was caught up in a devastating cyclone, which has wiped out villages in Vanuatu.

At least eight people have been confirmed dead after Cyclone Pam hit the 80-island-strong archipelago, with winds of up to 270km/h and causing heavy flooding, landslides, and mass destruction of buildings.

Relief workers are already making their way to Vanuatu, with fears the body count will rise, as Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop announced a $5 million aid package for the ravaged country, the ABC reported.

Communications and power for more than 260,000 people is still down, and access to a lot of areas has been cut off.

This leaves many Australians concerned for the safety of their family members - including Tahnia Cook who has not heard from her husband, Cameron, since Friday. 

Ms Cook told Daily Mail Australia they had moved to Vanuatu for 'a change of lifestyle' and help run a local resort in North Efate.

She said it had been a terrible few days for her as she awaits news of her husband. 

'It's looking to be a couple of days [before I hear from him],' Ms Cook said.

'Nobody has gone to the other side of the island because... [the Department of Foreign Affairs] haven't had a chance to venture out of [Port] Vila to get to surrounding villages.'

Ms Cook, who had been travelling between Australia and Vanuatu for a while now, said she also held concerns for locals and resort staff who she considered family now.

Ms Cook said she had not slept because she was worried about her husband and friends she considered family

The Australian told Weekend Today the last time she had spoken to her husband he had preparing for the storm.

She said she was trying to stay positive as Cameron was prepared for the worst at their new home, North Efate.

'It's painful, it's tiring. I haven't slept, I'm hanging on and hope to hear something soon,' Ms Cook said.

'He was well-prepared, he was putting up timber on windows. He was putting heavy items up on tin roofs. He was packing away all objects that could pick up in the strong wind. 

'He obviously preparing for his own safety in terms of food, water supply - for himself and the local villagers.' 

Heavy damage in Vanuatu means some areas are safe to be accessed at the moment

But it is feared the body count will rise with aid workers already heading to the devastated archipelago

Ms Cook said she would have been there with him if she had not travelled to Brisbane for medical reasons.

'Now I'm worried that's where it's been most impacted on that side of the island and I'm not too sure where he is or what he is doing right now,' she said.

'I'm really trying to stay positive and hope for the best but the reality is the photos and images I've seen from Port Vila so far, knowing that North Efate was in the direct line of the eye of the cyclone and it would have impacted a lot worse than Vila is not great news.'

Ms Cook said she was expecting to go back home and see complete devastation as the photos she had seen of buildings and structures damaged by Cyclone Pam were a lot stronger than the ones in North Efate.

'We're helping to run a small family resort, which will be absolutely annihilated,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'We were starting to get on track and all that's completely washed away now. We had a herb garden, new furniture, a restaurant and bungalows.

'I don't even know if I'll have a house to come back to. We might have to come back to Australia.'

Ms Cook also appealed to Australians for aid to help locals with their recovery efforts.

'Keep coming to Vanuatu, [locals are] really going to need money to keep coming through,' she said.

'After the funding stops, it's just a tourism trade. It's going to be really hard for us - we'll pull through but I’m more concerned about the locals.'

Ms Cook said she had already started fundraising for North Efate area.

With $600 under her belt so far, she was hoping to get to $10,000.

World Vision Australia communications officer Chloe Morrison documented her experience through the cyclone on the not-for-profit's blog.

'For more than seven hours I have been listening to wind roaring like an angry ocean as it tried to pick the house off the ground,' she wrote.

'I have heard our cyclone shutters bash aggressively against the windows. I have heard what sounds like someone’s roof land on ours. I heard rain bash the roof like someone playing the drums.'

Ms Morrison later told AAP: 'There are reports from our other colleagues of entire villages being literally blown away overnight.' 

Following the Category 5 disaster, Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop said the $5 million aid package would be decimated through non-government organisations, Red Cross Australia and the United Nations.

'We will also be deploying humanitarian suppliers to provide support for up to 5,000 people in the form of water, sanitation and shelter,' she told the ABC.

'We will be sending military transport planes, and deployment personnel, medical, humanitarian, consular, natural disaster experts and of course supplies.' 

Earlier on Saturday, Ms Bishop said there were probably 3,000 Australians in Vanuatu at any one time, but the government had not received any reports regarding Australian citizens.

The minister urged those who are concerned about their friends and families in Vanuatu should contact 1300 555 135.

It came after Vanuatu's lands minister Ralph Regenvanu announced a 'state of emergency' for the Shefa province, where Port Vila is located.

A curfew would also be introduced as there had been reported of 'low-level looting', according to the ABC. 

The storm crossed the main Vanuatu island where more than 65,000 people live and a group of islands further south, which are home to 33,000 people.

Some locals on the southern island of Erromango reportedly took shelter in caves as the severe conditions intensified.

'It's a traditional coping strategy,' Red Cross worker Aurelia Balpe said. 

UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said he had met the president of Vanuatu on Saturday morning and conveyed 'our deepest condolences' as well as solidarity with the people of the archipelago.

New Zealand has pledged an initial $1 million to help cyclone-stricken Pacific nations and an RNZAF P3 Orion is in the air assessing the damage. 

Australian Red Cross has made an appeal on Twitter, saying that Cyclone Pam caused 'unbelievable destruction'.

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop told reporters on Saturday morning Australia has a crisis response team ready to go and assist the Pacific Islands 

'Humanitarian needs will be enormous. Many people have lost their homes. Shelter, food and water urgent priorities,' Australian Red Cross tweeted. 

'Tens of thousands of people seeking safety in safe buildings and caves across Vanuatu.'

The president of Vanuatu, Baldwin Lonsdale, who was attending a World Conference on Disaster Risk and Reduction in Japan, told participants: “I do not really know what impact the cyclone has had on Vanuatu.”

'I am speaking to you today with a heart that is so heavy,' he said. 

'I stand to appeal on behalf of the government and the people to give a helping hand in this disaster.'

The storm is expected to track to the north-east of New Zealand during the next two days.
