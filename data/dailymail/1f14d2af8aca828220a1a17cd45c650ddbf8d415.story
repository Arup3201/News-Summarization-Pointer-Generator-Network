Australian scientists have developed a pen that enables them to create new bone tissues. 

When bones are broken in accidents or 
following amputations, the tissue inside them is also damaged, making it
 difficult to build new, fully functioning implants.

To solve this problem, a team of Australian researchers have created a handheld 3D printer called the BioPen which not only adds layers of tissue cells to damaged bones, but combines with existing nerves and muscles.

The BioPen prototype, pictured, was designed and built using 3D printing equipment in the labs at the University of Wollongong. It works in a similar way to a 3D printer by building layers of cells and alginate, or seaweed extract, before covering them in a protective gel

The device works in a similar way to a 3D 
printer by building layers of material.

It mixes cells with alginate, or seaweed extract, before 
covering them in a protective gel. 

The two layers of the material 
are mixed together in the tip of the BioPen and surgeons can use the 
mixture to ‘draw’ or ‘fill in’ damaged sections of bones.

As the 
mixture is drawn onto the bones, an ultraviolet light dries it so the 
surgeon can create layers of cells, or as the researchers call it, ‘bone
 scaffolding.’

The cells will then multiply, and eventually join the cells of tissue, including nerves or muscles.

It means surgeons can design customised implants during surgery, rather than waiting weeks to grow replacement tissue.

The BioPen technology could additionally cut recovery times and increase the chances of surgery success because the cells combine with the patient’s existing tissue to prevent rejection.

The device can also be used with other drugs to increase regrowth and recovery.

The BioPen prototype was designed and built at the University of Wollongong and was recently given to clinical partners at St Vincent’s Hospital Melbourne.

St Vincent’s will work on optimising the cell material for clinical projects due to be carried out at the proposed Aikenhead Centre for Medical Discovery in Melbourne next year.

The team at Wollongong University previously grew new knee cartilage from stem cells on 3D-printed scaffolds that could be used to treat cancers and osteoarthritis.

According to the researchers, the BioPen will ‘give surgeons greater control over where the materials are deposited while also reducing the time the patient is in surgery by delivering live cells and growth factors directly to the site of injury, accelerating the regeneration of functional bone and cartilage.’
