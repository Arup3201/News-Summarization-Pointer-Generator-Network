Sergio Aguero has revealed that the first time he met three-time Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi he had no idea who he was.

The Barcelona forward, who is considered by some to be the greatest player of all time, is now good friends with Aguero, and wasn't at all offended by the Manchester City star's ignorance.

'Yes that's true (that I didn't know who Messi was),' Aguero told City TV.

'I was about to turn 17. We were both called up for some friendlies. We were at the AFA (Argentine Football Association) training complex. We were sitting at the table with him, (Ezequiel) Garay and (Mauro) Formica.

'He sat beside me. I looked at him but I didn't know him. They were talking about Nike football boots and Garay was saying that they were really good. 

'Then Leo said: "They've brought them from the USA" so I started thinking: "Where is this guy from?"

'I couldn't resist and I asked him: "What's your name?" 

'He said: "Leo" and I asked: "and what's your last name?"

'He said: "Messi" and I didn't know him. I asked him again to see if his name sounded familiar. He laughed then we all laughed. They made fun of me.'
