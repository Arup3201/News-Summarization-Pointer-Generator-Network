A Silicon Valley technology firm flew eight workers 9,000 miles from Bangalore, India to California to install some computers and continued to pay them in rupees. 

The eight workers were employed to move computers for Electronics for Imaging Inc from their old headquarters in Foster City to their new building in California. 

During the three-month contract, the workers were paid the equivalent of $1.21-an-hour for a 120-hour week. 

Electronics for Imaging flew eight Indian workers almost 9,000 miles from Bangalore and paid them in rupees while working on a project to install computers in the company's new headquarters in Freemont, California

US department of Labor assistant district director Michael Eastwood described the situation in Electronics for Imaging, pictured,  as 'worse than anything that I ever saw in any of those Los Angeles sweatshops' 

The US Department of Labor found that the men worked a maximum of 122 hours in a week without receiving any overtime. 

The firm was ordered to pay more than $43,000 in back wages and penalties after the investigation. 

Electronics for Imaging is a printing technology specialist which had a turnover of $728 million last year. 

According to the Department of Labor, the company was paying its workers far below the $8 per hour minimum wage applicable in California at the time. 

The company said it 'unintentionally overlooked' US laws requiring foreign workers to be paid at least the minimum wage and overtime if they worked in excess of 40 hours in a week.  

Instead, the company gave the Indians unspecified bonuses while paying the transferred workers the same wages they normally received in their normal jobs in Bangalore, India. The workers were even paid in rupees while in the US

Michael Eastwood, a Department of Labor assistant district director, said the abuses at Electronics for Imaging were among the most outrageous he had ever seen - even worse than problems he had seen at garment factories in southern California.

He said: 'This is worse than anything that I ever saw in any of those Los Angeles sweatshops.' 

Although it is not among Silicon Valley's high-profile companies, Electronics for Imaging is successful. The company earned $109 million last year and awarded CEO Guy Gecht with a pay package valued at nearly $6 million, including more than $1.2 million in salary and bonuses.

Electronics for Imaging is paying more than $40,000 in back wages and damages to the eight Indian workers and a $3,520 fine.
