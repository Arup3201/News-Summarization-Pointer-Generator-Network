Britain and Germany are on a collision course as the row over the future of the eurozone and the UK's EU membership intensified.

Chancellor George Osborne has given the biggest hint yet there may be a referendum, and to her clear anger, David Cameron told Angela Merkel last night Britain will not join her proposed European superstate.

During yesterday's Berlin crisis talks the Prime Minister openly rejected the German chancellor's plan to save the eurozone from oblivion by forming a single Euro-country, calling the idea 'nonsense'.

But in return Mr Cameron was publicly mocked by Mrs Merkel for being 'impatient' and telling her to put German cash behind an ‘immediate’ rescue plan for the 
euro or start planning for the break-up of the single currency.

Row: David Cameron and Angela Merkel have got involved in a war of words over the future of the eurozone as they met in Berlin yesterday

In a clear snub to the PM she said last night: 'It is human to think the euro crisis could be solved in one fell swoop - but I don't think this would work.

'The euro crisis developed over ten years and it is going to take several years before we can repair the system and make it viable again. With everybody getting so impatient here it is a good job that I am one of the people staying patient.'

Mr Cameron has repeatedly clashed with the German chancellor on the future of Europe as she outlined plans for what she called ‘more Europe’ - a euro-superstate in all but name.

They were discussing the crisis that has left Spanish banks teetering on the edge of collapse and Greece bankrupt, but it appears the two powers are still far apart on a solution.

Britain is backing European Commission plans for a common ‘banking union’ across the eurozone but Mr Cameron has demanded ‘safeguards’ for Britain and pledged that no British money would be spent on propping up these institutions.

Making the point: The pair have clear views and although they both want to save the eurozone both appear to be suspicious of their own country's plans

He even threatened to use the veto to ensure no UK taxpayers' money is used to foot the bill.

‘I can sense why some eurozone countries want to look at elements of banking union. But because we are not in the single currency, we won’t take part in profound elements of that banking union,' he said.

‘I wouldn’t ask British taxpayers to stand behind the Greek or Spanish deposits. It’s not our currency, so it would be inappropriate to do that.

‘I will make sure that Britain’s interests, particularly in the single market and the operation of fairness in the single market, are protected. That is the key for Britain.’ 

However, Mrs Merkel has demanded full ‘political union’ in the eurozone and said Germany would not be stopped by countries such as Britain dragging their feet.

‘We need more Europe, a budget union and we need a political union first and foremost,’ she said.

‘We must, step by step, cede responsibilities to Europe. We must not remain immobile because one country or another does not want to follow yet.’

Before their talks, Mr Cameron and 
Mrs Merkel answered questions from students at a town hall event at the 
Federal Chancellery in Berlin.

Mr
 Cameron once again voiced his strong opposition to a Europe-wide 
financial transactions tax, which he said would simply drive jobs and 
growth away from the continent.

Britain's
 financial services industry was already 'making a proper contribution' 
to helping get the national deficit under control, through taxes such as
 the banking levy, the Prime Minister said.

But
 he recognised that the mistakes made by banks in the run-up to the 
crash of 2008/09 had fuelled the anger seen in the movement to occupy 
areas of the City of London with tent cities.

'I
 think a lot of the anger was with irresponsibility in the banking 
industry and the financial industry and I think people were right to be 
angry because banks had made bad decisions and had to be bailed out by 
the taxpayer, and many of the taxpayers were earning much, much less 
than the people who made the bad decisions in the banks,' he added.

'People were angry about that. But anger is not a policy.

'We need to work out what do we do, how do we regulate these organisations properly.

'We think we have responded properly to the anger.'

Meanwhile George Osborne yesterday gave the Government’s strongest hint yet that a referendum is likely on Britain’s place in Europe – but stopped short of promising one.

Poll: George Osborne is the first cabinet member to hint at an EU referendum but would not promise one

The Chancellor became the first senior member of the Cabinet to suggest that a nationwide vote would be necessary to redraw the UK’s relationship with Brussels if the euro crisis leads to greater integration between eurozone nations.

Mr Osborne pointedly referred to the Government’s new law that would trigger a referendum if powers are passed to the EU as ‘one of the most significant things this Government has done’.

Crucially, he suggested that the new Europe likely to emerge from the wreckage of the single currency will indeed mean powers passing to Brussels.

So far ministers from David Cameron down have stressed that a referendum is not necessary because changes that affect only the eurozone do not involve powers being ceded to Brussels from the UK.

But Mr Osborne suggested the fundamental change in the nature of the EU, with eurozone countries effectively merging their fiscal policies and potentially their bank deposits, is such a fundamental change that the British public should have their say.

‘A reshaped relationship with Europe would imply, would involve, a transfer of  sovereignty or powers to Brussels,’ he said.

‘We have a very clear safeguard in the system now, thanks to this government, which is, if there is any transfer of power from this country . . . transfer of competence or transfer of sovereignty from this country to the European Union . . . then there will be a referendum.’ 

And calls for a straight in-out poll are growing from the Right and now the Left.

Former Labour Foreign Secretary has said Britain has the perfect opportunity to break from the 'shackles' imposed by Brussels as members like Germany close ranks to form a 'single country called Europe'.

The electorate must be asked two simple questions, would the UK be better off leaving the EU, or staying and joining the euro, he said.

'A referendum on the future of Europe is inevitable at some point between 2013 and 2016 at the latest,' he wrote in The Times.

Britain's Foreign Secretary from 1977-79 said the UK would be better off cutting links with Brussels to join a wider single market to include non-EU members like Turkey and Iceland, which he calls the 'European Community'.

'This has to happen because Britain's vision for an EU of no further integration and Germany's wish for near-complete integration are incompatible.'
