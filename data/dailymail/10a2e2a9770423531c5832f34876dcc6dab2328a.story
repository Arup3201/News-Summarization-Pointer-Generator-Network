Bayern Munich fans paid a touching tribute to a fan nicknamed 'Fabi', who passed away during the Bundesliga's winter break.

The Bayern fans displayed a drawing of Fabi's face as others held aloft large red hearts ahead of their team's 1-1 Bundesliga draw against Schalke.

Unfortunately for the home support, Bayern could only manage a point against Roberto di Matteo's side after a Benedikt Howedes header cancelled out Arjen Robben's opener.

The draw meant the German champions remain winless in 2015 after holding on with 10 men to earn the 1-1 draw.

Pep Guardiola's side retained its eight-point lead over Wolfsburg, which clinched a late 1-1 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt.

Bayern lost Jerome Boateng to a red card in the 17th minute and were lucky not to fall behind as goalkeeper Manuel Neuer easily caught the resulting penalty from Eric-Maxim Choupo-Moting.

Robben put Bayern ahead in the 67th minute only for Howedes to equalise five minutes later.
