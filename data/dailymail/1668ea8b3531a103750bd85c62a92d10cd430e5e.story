'Jobsworth' binmen have refused to empty 20 wheelie bins on a single street because they were all just 'one inch too full' and therefore too dangerous to deal with.

The refuse collectors in Stockport, Greater Manchester, ignored a third of black bins left outside on collection day saying health and safety rules stopped them collecting bins which did not have the lid fully closed.

Instead householders on Alldis Street got a sticker on the bins - which carry non recyclable waste including plastic and polystyrene - and nowhere to put their waste for the next fortnight.

Anger: Bins like this one in Stockport were left by binmen who refused to empty them because they were an inch 'too full'

'Sorry we are unable to collect any extra waste or recycling that doesn’t fit into your wheelie bin. The lids of the bin must be closed to collect safely,' the sticker said.

But one local resident, a young father, who wished to remain anonymous, said: 'The binmen left all the bins which had their lids raised - even if it was just half an inch.

'We all got stickers warning us about overflowing bins too - yet they should collect the rubbish every week.

'It’s a nightmare. My bin was already overflowing but it is now overflowing a lot more because the binmen failed to empty it and now the outside of my home looks like a tip.

Stuck: Each bin had a sticker explaining how full a bin must be, but the one on the sticker is much fuller than some that were left behind by the refuse collectors

'With having a little lad, the bins get full up quite quickly and because they are only collected every two weeks, we just can’t keep on top of it.

'I’ve even asked the collectors if they can take an extra bin bag, as the bin will only fit two bags in. They just told me that they weren’t allowed to do it.

'The bin collectors won’t even empty the bins if the lid is open a tiny bit - it’s stupid. Why should the rubbish be left in my garden if I have put my bins out like I’m supposed to?

'I think it’s outrageous that we have to pay council tax for a service that we are not getting, and it makes me very angry. The bags are just stacking up, and it looks terrible.

'The bins should be collected every week, and we shouldn’t be left with the rubbish that is supposed to have been collected.'

Another householder said: 'This must be worth a council tax refund. It’s disgrace that bins should not be emptied because they are too full. These binmen are just being jobsworths.'

Bamboozled: Locals residents say they are utterly confused by the number of bins they need to use at home

Officials at coalition run Stockport Council spent £7.3m of taxpayers cash on a new system different coloured wheelie bins - whilst shedding 350 jobs under Government cutbacks.

But they bamboozled locals with a system which includes blue bins being earmarked for paper and card, brown bins are now to be used for glass and plastic and green bins for garden waste and food.

They also brought in new black bins for non recyclable waste and 'caddies' also for food to replaced the 'old' single black bins which the 136,000 residents of the town used to have outside their homes.

The letters under Section 46 of the Clean Neighbourhood and Environment Act 2005 warned locals if they continued to flout the rules they would instantly face a £100 fine, and if they failed to pay up they could be taken to court and fined up to £1,000.

Today Stockport Council said: 'Non-collection of overfull bins is in line with Council policy which states that wheeled containers containing waste that does not fit comfortably within the container and the lid is ajar will not be collected.

'A notice will be left on the container explaining why the waste hasn’t been collected. The householder will need to use the Household Waste Recycling Centre/Local Recycling site, or wait until the next collection.'
