A group of shoppers at a Texas strip mall smashed through a hot car's windows Monday to pull out two screaming children locked in by their mother, who was getting a haircut.

Video taken at the scene shows a group of men and women so desperate to get out the little boy and girl that one man took a hammer to the black Jeep's window as temperatures in the Houston suburb of Katy reached up to 98 degrees.

'The kids were in there crying,' nearby shop owner Gabriel Del Valle told KHOU. 'I mean you would understand. It’s real hot.'

Desperate measures: Some shoppers at a Texas strip mall were so desperate to get two kids out of a hot car that they smashed a window with a hammer

Screaming kids: The rescue was caught on camera by a nearby shop owner who said the two kids were screaming and crying. Even after they smashed the window, they had trouble getting them out because of child safety locks

Footage shows shoppers going so far as to crawl atop the car to try to climb inside when child safety locks kept them from opening the door.

It only took a few minutes to free the unharmed children.

By then, their mother had run outside the salon where she was getting her hair done.

The mother said she'd only left them there temporarily but admitted she'd made a terrible mistake.

After the mother pleaded with them, the mob of shoppers decided not to call the police.

However, Del Valle was still left with a bad taste in his mouth.
