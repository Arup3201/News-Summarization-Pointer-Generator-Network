A new wing of global terror group al Qaeda which has formed in India, could be set to target the United States.

It comes after the group, who have been named Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) released a video earlier this week announcing their formation.

In it Al Qaeda leader Ayman al Zawahiri says they will 'raise the flag of jihad' across the 'Indian subcontinent'.

A still from a video released earlier this week showing Al Qaeda leader Ayman al Zawahiri announcing that the terror group has formed a new wing in the United States 

Now it has emerged that the group, who were responsible for the 9/11 terror attacks on New York's World Trade Centre, is targeting the United States once again.

The SITE monitoring service quoted AQIS spokesman Usama Mahmoud as saying the group's goals include 'waging jihad against America and the system of global disbelief', and 'uprooting it, in order to establish Sharia-based governance', according to an audio speech.

He added: 'This is the system that put upon worshippers of Allah a political system built on non-religious, democratic, secular principles, and weakened the Islamic creed and corrupted Muslim society.

Al Qaeda leader Ayman al Zawahiri announced the formation of an Indian branch of his militant group he said would spread Islamic rule and 'raise the flag of jihad' across the subcontinent.

He said: 'My Muslim brothers everywhere, peace be with you today, I announce to all Muslims in the world and especially in the Indian subcontinent, the founding of a new branch of Qaedat al-Jihad.

'This is to help raise the flag of jihad and the return of the Islamic rule in the subcontinent, which one day used to be part of the land of the Muslims until the infidel enemy took it over and divided it.'

He also renewed a longstanding vow of loyalty to Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Omar, in an apparent snub to the Islamic State armed group challenging al Qaeda for leadership of transnational Islamist militancy.

Zawahri described the formation of 'Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent' as glad tidings for Muslims 'in Burma, Bangladesh, Assam, Gujarat, Ahmedabad, and Kashmir' and said the new wing would rescue Muslims there from injustice and oppression. 

'And because of this system, apostate, traitor armies were put upon the Islamic lands and the rulers hostile to Islam.'

The formation of the new wing of Al Qaeda comes as the United States, Britain and other western countries focus on the continuing threat from ISIS, who have declared parts of Iraq and Syria an Islamic state.

It is thought that ISIS recently split from Al Qaeda's control in a direct challenge to their authority.

The timing and content of the video suggests rivalry between al Qaeda and ISIS, which anecdotal evidence suggests is gathering support in South Asia.

According to media reports, Islamic State pamphlets have been distributed in Pakistan in recent days.

'Al Qaeda has seen its authority eroded by the fact that it is no longer able to independently carry out large-scale attacks anywhere in the world, and by the emergence of rival factions,' Omar Hamid, head of Asia analysis at security research firm IHS Country Risk, wrote in a report.

Al Qaeda's establishment of a local branch seeks to take advantage of the planned withdrawal of U.S.-led forces from Afghanistan, which may lead to an influx of battle-hardened militants into India, Hamid added.

Until a few days ago, there has been no evidence that al Qaeda had a presence in India.

On Thursday, several provinces in India were put on alert after the announcement of the formation of AQIS.

New Delhi regards the message as authentic and has warned local governments, said an official who attended a security briefing in which it was discussed with Home Minister Rajnath Singh, who is responsible for policing and internal security.

An official said: 'This matter has been taken very seriously. An alert has been sounded.'

Indian security forces are usually on a state of alert for attacks by home-grown Islamist militants and by anti-India groups based in Pakistan. It was not immediately clear what additional steps were being taken.

Zawahri's announcement made two references to Gujarat, the home state of India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a Hindu nationalist. 

Hedescribed the formation of 'Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent' as glad tidings for Muslims 'in Burma, Bangladesh, Assam, Gujarat, Ahmedabad, and Kashmir' and said the new wing would rescue Muslims there from injustice and oppression.

Tensions between Hindus and Muslims on the subcontinent have grown since Pakistan was carved from Muslim-majority areas of India in 1947 in a violent partition in which hundreds of thousands were killed.

Kashmir, which is claimed by both India and Pakistan, has long attracted foreign mujahideen fighters as well as home-grown separatist militants.

In June, al Qaeda released a video urging young radicals in Kashmir to draw inspiration from militants in Syria and Iraq and join the 'global jihad'.
