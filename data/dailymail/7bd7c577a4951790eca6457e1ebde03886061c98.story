President Obama doesn’t believe comments made by Hillary Clinton about how she and former President Bill Clinton were ‘not only dead broke but in debt’ when they exited the White House in 2001 will become a big issue if she chooses to run for president.

‘As soon as you jump back into the spotlight in a more explicitly political way, you’re going to be fly-spec like this,’ the President told George Stephanopoulos in an interview aired on ABC’s This Week on Sunday.

‘She’s accustomed to it. Anybody who gets involved in public life is accustomed to it. Over time I don’t think it’s going to make a big difference.’

The President told George Stephanopoulos in an interview aired on ABC's This Week on Sunday that 'Hillary has been to this rodeo a bunch of times' and her comments wouldn't harm her chances in a presidential run

The President went on to say that his former Secretary of State has a political record that speaks for itself.

‘I think that Hillary has been to this rodeo a bunch of times,’ he said. ‘She is in public service [be]cause she cares about the same folks that I talked to here today. Her track record on that speaks for itself.’

The president comments come as a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Annenberg poll reveals that 55 percent of Americans say Hillary can relate to and understand the problems of average citizens as well as other presidential candidates can.

By comparison, 37 percent of respondents disagreed, saying she can’t relate as well as other candidates can.

'Not really well off': Following a blistering 2012 presidential campaign in which Democrats pilloried Republican Mitt Romney for being super-wealthy and out of touch, Clinton risks falling into that category

The poll of 592 adults was conducted June 26-28 and it has a margin of error of plus-minus 5.1 percentage points.

Clinton made the widely criticized comment while promoting her new book Hard Choices.

'We came out of the White House not only dead broke, but in debt,' she told ABC's Diane Sawyer, answering a question about the six-figure payments she and her husband command when giving paid speeches.

Democrats argue that Clinton's personal wealth won't be able to overshadow a long career in public service, which began as an advocate for poor families at the Children's Defense Fund and led to years of work in Arkansas and Washington on issues such as early childhood education, expanded health care coverage and job creation.

'Attacks are most effective when they play into a pre-existing stereotype about a candidate,' said Ben LaBolt, a former Obama campaign spokesman.

'Nobody thinks that Hillary Clinton spent her career focused on making money. She was in the public eye advocating for a policy agenda.'

In the interview with PBS NewsHour broadcast on Wednesday, Clinton said her record 'speaks for itself' and her 'unartful use of those few words doesn't change who I am, what I've stood for my entire life, what I stand for today.'

'Bill and I have had terrific opportunities, both of us, you know, have worked hard,' she said.

'But we’ve been grateful for everything that we’ve been able to achieve, and sadly that’s just not true for most Americans today.'
