Hillary Clinton was not telling the truth when she said the Obama campaign asked her to attack Sarah Palin for being a woman, President Barack Obama's 2008 campaign manager, David Plouffe, said in an interview released last weekend.

'We never tried to do that,' Plouffe said on an episode of Bloomberg Television’s Political Capital with Al Hunt.

'We did want her to go out there and speak, but not about Sarah Palin’s gender.'

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton claims in her new book that Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign wanted her to make a sexist attack on Sarah Palin when she was announced as the Republican Vice Presidential candidate

Clinton claimed in an interview with NBC earlier this month that, 'The day [Palin] was nominated, the Obama campaign did contact me and asked me if I would attack her.'

'I
 said, "Attack her for what — for being a woman? Attack her for being on
 a ticket that's trying to draw attention? There'll be plenty of time to
 do what I think you should do in politics, which is draw distinctions,"
 ' Clinton recalled.

Clinton also described the run-in over Palin in her recently released memoir Hard Choices.

The 2008 presidential candidate writes in the book that, 'The Obama campaign suspected that her nomination was a blatant attempt to scuttle their hope of welcoming the women who had vigorously supported me. They immediately issued a dismissive statement and reached out to me in hopes I would follow suit.'

'But I wouldn't. I was not going to attack Palin just for being a woman appealing for support from other women. I didn't think it made political sense, and it didn't feel right. So I said no...''

Sarah Palin posted a picture of the passage on her twitter account when the book dropped with the caption, 'Look who fired the 1st shot in the real "war on women". Hint: it wasn't the GOP. See this excerpt from Hillary's book.'

The timing of Plouffe's claim is curious given that NBC News' Cynthia McFadden said weeks ago that the former secretary of state told her 
during their sit-down interview that she allowed the White House to 
review her book before it went to print because it included accounts 
from the time she served in the president's cabinet.

Plouffe has not worked at the White House for more than a year, and therefore may not have received a copy of the book before it was published like current senior staff did.

But other members of Obama's team read it beforehand and reportedly made no requests for revisions, according to McFadden.

The afternoon before Clinton's book officially hit the shelves, Sarah Palin, who had somehow gotten a copy early, sent a tweet ridiculing the Obama administration for claiming it's her political party who has a 'war or women'

Clinton's decision to speak out about the incident nearly six years later may be fueled by guilt.

In an interview with ABC
 News' Diane Sawyer that around the time of the book's release, Clinton 
confessed that she didn't do a very good job during the 2008 
presidential campaign of pointing out that 'there is a double standard' 
for women in the public eye.

'And I think part of what I did not do was to be more clear in saying, 
"Look, this is a problem in our country. And people oughtta think about 
their own daughters, their own sisters, their own mothers when they make
 comments about women in public life, whether they're in politics or the
 media or anywhere else," ' Clinton said.
