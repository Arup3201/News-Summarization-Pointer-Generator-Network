A teenaged Oklahoma race car driver who’s physical burns and the unthinkable loss of the fellow racer who pulled her from fiery wreckage says she musty bravely race on in her hero’s name.

Harli White, 18, battled past excruciating physical pain in the aftermath of her 2008 crash only to have her savior-turned-mentor Donnie Ray Crawford slain at the hand of his own grandfather.

Now, White has vows that she’s in the race for life, both for herself and for Donnie.

'I try to honor him by doing the best that I can do, and by winning as many races as I can,' Harli told ESPN in a documentary special detail the Lindsay, Oklahoma teen’s unbelievable tale of tragedy and triumph.

In her very first competitive race, at the age of 12, Harli’s midget sprint car spun into a wall. Within seconds, she said, she was surrounded by fire.

Minutes passed and Harli’s injuries worsened. Her father tried desperately to get her out but she was stuck and her fate seemed sealed.

And it was sealed, insomuch as it was to be entwined forever with that of Donnie Ray Crawford.

Crawford was 20 at the time and waiting in his own car for the next race when he heard the panicked call over his radio about a horrible fire.

Unbelievable: After hearing of the fire on his radio as he wanted in his car for the next race, Donnie ran and leaped into the flames to save her with no regard for his own safety and they both made it through alive

Agonizing: Harli suffered burns across 40 percent of her body but lived to race again and become fast friends with Donnie and his family

The rising midget circuit star sprang into action. While wearing his fire retardant jump suit,  to rescue a girl he’d never met.

'He was just seeing a big ball of fire and he ran right straight in the middle of it,' Harli's dad Charlie said in an ESPN special about his daughter called Forged by Fire.

'Not knowing if it was going to explode again, not knowing if he was going to come out of it, not knowing if the person inside was alive or dead. He just knew that there was somebody in trouble.'

Senseless: On January 14, 2012, another tragedy struck. Donnie's mentally ill live-in grandfather Daniel Garcia (left), for no apparent reason, shot and killed Donnie. He was also killed in the ensuing struggle with Donnie's mom and dad

Harli was saved and she had Donnie to thank, but he wanted none of it.

'He didn't want the credit for it. He just said he was a vessel,' said his mother Jodie.

The two families would become close friends and Donnie and Harli raced as friendly competitors for the next three years.

'It hit me so hard,' Harli said. 'He is my hero...he saved my life, but yet he's gone?'

Then another tragic race day came on January 14, 2012, only this time the tragedy struck before the race.

As they all got ready for a race that day, one Harli would race in, Donnie’s mentally ill live-in grandfather Daniel Garcia shot and killed Donnie.

There was a struggle as Jodie and her husband got her father down to the floor.

‘At one point, we all three had our hands on the gun, and we were just kind of in a standstill motion. We were frozen, all three of us. I looked over at Donnie Ray ... and the way he was laying, he was looking straight at us,’ the stricken mother said.

Garcia was dead, as well.

The Crawfords had senselessly lost their son, aged just 24, and Harli had lost her mentor.

'It hit me so hard,' Harli said. 'He is my hero...he saved my life, but yet he's gone?'

The intrepid teen has channel all her grief and pain into winning races, the way the talented Donnie would have wanted.

The Crawfords and the Whites have grown apart without Donnie around to get them out to races.

But Jodie and her husband made it out to watch Harli clench the OCRS sprint car season championship in Wainwright, Oklahoma and become her region's first female titleholder.

In a way, watching Harli win allowed the Crawfords to see Donnie win again.

'We have to look at her as our miracle,’ said Jodie. ‘We have to look at her as part of Donnie Ray.’

Harli has vowed to race on in Donnie's name. 'I try to honor him by doing the best that I can do, and by winning as many races as I can,' she said
