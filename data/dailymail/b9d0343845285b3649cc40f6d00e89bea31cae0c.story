Operagoers walked a gauntlet of protesters calling for the cancellation of an opera that dramatizes the killing of a Jewish American on opening night Monday.

Former mayor Rudolph Giuliani was among the public figures appearing at a rally  against The Death of Klinghoffer, a 1991 opera by John Adams, at the Metropolitan Opera. 

On stage, actors depicted the 1985 hijacking of cruise ship Achille Lauro by four militants from the Palestinians Liberation Front, leading to the killing of wheelchair-bound New Yorker Leon Klinghoffer.

Some in the crowd booed after the opening piece, 'Chorus of Exiled Palestinians,' in which the destruction of a Palestinian's home is mourned, followed by the 'Chorus of Exiled Jews.'

During the first half, a man in the audience repeatedly yelled, 'The murder of Klinghoffer will never be forgiven,' and after the intermission a woman shouted an expletive and walked out. 

The New York Times reports that the man was arrested for disorderly conduct.

But the evening ended with a standing ovation that drowned out any heckling. 

'There are obviously some people who came here to be heard, and unfortunately they’re disrupting the performance, but we were prepared for worse,' said Peter Gelb at intermission.

Gelb, the Met's general manager, was a target of the protesters outside, who waved signs suggesting he took money from terrorists. 

For some critics of the work, the juxtaposition of Israeli abuses with the cruise ship hijacking is meant to absolve the terrorists depicted in the opera.

Klinghoffer's daughters, Lisa and Ilsa, have publicly decried the opera, which has debuted in several cities and is often hailed as a masterpiece of American opera, as making 'false moral equivalencies.'

'It rationalizes, romanticizes, and legitimizes the terrorist murder of our father,' reads a statement by the daughters printed in the Playbill of the new production. 

Ari Mandel, a New York University student attending his first opera told Haaretz the play was 'not doing any of that.'

Murder: The opera dramatizes the murder of Klinghoffer, when a terrorist executed him and threw his body into the water off a cruise ship

Voices: The main terrorist, Omar, has an aria in the opera, but it is sung by a character called the Palestinian Woman, played in the Met's production by Israeli opera singer Maya Lahyani

Dramatization: The opera depicts the Palestinian Liberation Front holding the ship hostage, but gives voices to the individual characters

'They don’t soften the blow,' Mandel said. 'They’re not trying to make the terrorists look like anything other than what they are.'

The production was originally planned to be accompanied by a live high-definition broadcast in November, but drew protests from Jewish groups. 

After talking with the Anti-Defamation League, the Met decided to cancel the broadcast, saying it might be used to fan global antisemitism, according to the Guardian.

The characters do not allow the killers to go without rebuke. As the play ends, the audience watches Klinghoffer's wife Marilyn being told her husband has been killed by the captain of the ship.

'You embraced them,' she sings in the final aria, condemning both her husband's killers and the captain for accommodating them.
