Falcao has missed Manchester United's last three games because of muscle injury

Colombia boss Jose Pekerman believes the striker could be fit to face Arsenal on November 22

Pekerman said: 'There is no doubt he is in optimal condition. He's recovered very successfully. He done everything perfectly. This is a small muscular injury, it is different to the knee injury before the World Cup.

'He's in a good condition and could be ready for Arsenal. He hasn't even started yet. He will be one of the best players Manchester United have had and will break a lot of records in England.'

In Falcao's absence, Teofilo Gutierrez headed in Edwin Cardona's cross in the 87th minute to beat America as Colombia came from a goal down.

USA took the lead in the 10th minute through Jozy Altidore's penalty, but Colombia equalised in the second half when James Rodriguez played a delicate through pass into the path of Carlos Bacca who rounded Brad Guzan and scored.
