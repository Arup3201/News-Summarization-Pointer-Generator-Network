Labour peer and former lord chancellor Lord Falconer of Thoroton accepted his Assisted Dying Bill will run out of Parliamentary time after it was debated yesterday in the House of Lords

A controversial proposal giving some terminally ill patients the right to die will not become law before the election, supporters conceded last night.

Labour peer and former lord chancellor Lord Falconer of Thoroton accepted his Assisted Dying Bill will run out of Parliamentary time after it was debated yesterday in the House of Lords.

But supporters pledged to continue to fight for the Bill after the General Election.

It would allow doctors to prescribe a lethal dose of medication to any terminally-ill patient who wants to end their life and who is judged to have six months or less to live.

It includes safeguards that give judicial oversight over the process. Under the proposals, two doctors would have to sign off the fatal dose.

The proposal has provoked strident opposition from leading faith leaders and some doctors' organisations.

David Cameron has repeatedly spoken against the plans - saying it could lead to people feeling 'unfairly pressurised' into ending their lives.

Assisted suicide remains a criminal offence in England and Wales, technically punishable by up to 14 years in prison.

Earlier this year Norman Lamb, the Lib Dem minister in charge of care for the elderly backed the change in the law on assisted dying.

Britain's main faith leaders have rejected the plans, but the former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey said this year he supports the idea.

Yesterday peers spent five hours of detailed discussion on the Bill's proposals, but completed only a handful of amendments.

Dozens more would have to be dealt with before the Bill reaches the House of Commons and Lord Falconer accepted it would not get through its Commons stages.

During the debate, former EastEnders star Lord Michael Cashman said he considered suicide after his long-term partner died last year.

The Labour Peer, said he was 'absolutely clear that if my husband and partner was to die, I wanted to die with him.'

He said his partner Paul Cottingham died of a 'very aggressive cancer' shortly before he joined the Lords.

'It came back very swiftly and his death was, I am certain, assisted.'

Calling for clarity in dealing with assisted dying, he said: 'I was healthy but I wanted to commit suicide to end a healthy life.'

Mr Cottingham was facing a death that could have happened in three days or three months, he said.

'To see him completely almost out of his senses because of the morphine but still aware that he was unable to breathe ... is for me clarity enough that I wanted to commit suicide and my husband who was dying needed his death accelerated.'

Peers rejected a move to refer to the legislation as 'assisted suicide' instead of 'assisted dying' by a majority of 73.

Lord Falconer said this was the first contested vote on his Bill and represented an 'overwhelming vote' in its favour.

'I'm very pleased with the way it has gone. The significance of the day is the vote in the Bill's favour.'

He vowed to bring a similar Bill back after the election if he got the chance in the next Parliament.

Ministers have repeatedly said the issue is for Parliament to decide with the Government remaining 'neutral'.

Baroness Campbell of Surbiton, who has severe spinal muscular atrophy – a degenerative disease - warned the Bill was all about making law 'for the strong at the expense of the weak'.

Speaking through a ventilator, Lady Campbell warned the current wording of the Bill was 'terribly open to misinterpretation and abuse', while reinforcing 'confusion' between terminal illness and disability.

Several peers warned of the possibility of having 'doctors for hire' to certify applications for assisted dying.

Sarah Wootton, chief executive of campaign group Dignity in Dying, said: 'We are now debating how, not if, we change the law on assisted dying for the terminally ill.

'This reflects the fact that most members of the House of Lords are now in agreement with the overwhelming majority of the public that the current law is unsustainable and cruel to those dying people suffering against their wishes at the end of life.

She added: 'The clear and settled will of the public that the law needs to change is consistently evidenced by opinion polls.'
