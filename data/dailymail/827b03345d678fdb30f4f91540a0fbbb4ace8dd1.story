A 13-year-old boy pulled out of the River Thames by police last night drowned on the second day of the school holidays after apparently trying to retrieve a ball.

Kyrece Francis is believed to have died after getting into difficulty in the fast-flowing river in Marlow, Buckinghamshire at around 4.30pm yesterday.

Today family, friends and teachers from Great Marlow School - where Kyrece studied - gathered for a brief memorial and to pay tribute to the popular pupil.

Kyrece Francis was remembered by friends as a promising footballer and a 'genuine' and 'great' guy. He apparently drowned in the River Thames at Marlow, Buckinghamshire trying to retrieve a ball

The
 acting headmaster of Great Marlow School, Linton Nash, paid tribute to Kyrece, who had only been a pupil for nine months.

He said: 'Kyrece Marshall-Francis was a charming and friendly young man, who was kind, respectful and sociable.

'Although
 he only joined the school nine months ago, he had already made a wide 
circle of friends and made a fantastic impact, especially in sport.'

Mr Nash added: 'Kyrece
 was a wonderful presence in his tutor group and set a great example to 
his peers with 100 per cent attendance and one of the highest number of 
reward points for effort, behaviour and supporting other pupils in his 
class.

'He had chosen his GCSE options for Year 10, including both PE and Drama at which he excelled. The whole school community will be devastated that Kyrece has died at so young an age and in such tragic circumstances.

'Everyone's thoughts are with his family and friends who can rely on our support as they begin to come to terms with his loss.'

The alarm was raised yesterday when a friend of 
Kyrece dialled 999 on his mobile phone to say that the boy had gone under the 
water and had failed to resurface.

It
 was believed he was swept downstream by the fast flowing current and 
his body was eventually found near the village of Bourne End.

Friends
 who were at the scene when the tragedy happened wrote on social media 
that before he disappeared beneath the surface for the last time, Kyrece
 shouted to his pals: 'I love you all.'

His
 mother, Simone Francis, wearing a bright blue football shirt, today hugged 
her son's devastated friends and looked at the mass of flowers that had 
been laid in tribute to the young Chelsea fan.

Kyrece's stepfather, Lewis Cooke, and his sister and step siblings were also said to have been present.

Three teenagers, softly spoken friends of Kyrece, addressed the mourners.

One said: 'The amount of people here shows how much everybody loved and respected Kyrece.'

Among the sea of flowers left at the gates of Great Marlow School were school shirts, teddy bears, balloons and flags.

One
 teacher, who declined to be named, said: 'He was a very popular boy. 
This is a lovely school and this is a testament of that. They were all 
very respectful.'

The
 body of the teenager was discovered by officers from the force's 
Specialist Search and Rescue Team shortly after 8pm last night.

Friends of Kyrece took to Twitter and Facebook to express their shock and sadness at his death.

One pal wrote: 'People are saying his body ended up being found in Bourne End. Shows how fast and strong that current was.

They continued: 'Also that before the last time he went under and did not come back up he said to Nathan, Josh, and Jamie etc. “Love you all".'

'I miss and love this guy so much he was just amazing and my love and respect goes out to his family mostly but also to his loving girlfriend. . . you just gotta keep your chin up.'

Kyrece was a pupil at Great Marlow School, which broke up for the summer holidays last week.

The police said the death is not believed to be suspicious and officers are preparing a report on the incident to be handed over to the coroner.
