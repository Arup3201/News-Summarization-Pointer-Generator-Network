A gang who attacked a young soldier from Prince Harry's old air base like a 'pack of wolves' have been jailed.

The five-strong gang were seen jubilantly 'bumping fists' as Jack Shilton, 21, lay unconscious after they'd repeatedly punched him in the face and kicked him in the head.

Mr Shilton, of the Army Air Corps, who maintains helicopters at RAF Wattisham, near Stowmarket, Suffolk, was on leave when he was attacked.

His high-profile air force station hit the headlines when Prince Harry was based there in 2011-12 as he learned to fly the Apache gunship chopper.

The gang members were branded cowardly, despicable and a disgrace by a judge after they stole Mr Shilton's wallet and phone and dragged him along the ground by his underpants in the brutal late-night attack in Ipswich.

Brutal: The gang were caught on CCTV demanding soldier Jack Shilton, 21, to hand over his wallet before attacking him in Ipswich

Violent: A court heard how the gang acted like a 'pack of wolves' as they beat Mr Shilton to the ground

The soldier, who served his country in Afghanistan, had gone out to celebrate with his Army colleague Peter Scott, who'd just returned from a tough tour fighting the Taliban in Helmand.

Judge Rupert Overbury told the court how the gang had pounced like 'a pack of wolves determined on its prey' on the soldier.

He said there was an 'element of degradation' as one of the thugs booted the defenceless serviceman as he lay on the ground and another hauled him along the road.

Judge Overbury told the defendants at Ipswich Crown Court: 'While your victim has served this country, your country, in Afghanistan, to protect you and the rest of us from the threat of future harm, you have behaved in a cowardly and despicable fashion.

'Each of you is a disgrace to your family and a disgrace to your community.'

Jerran Hart, 22, of Ipswich, and Adam Poulter, 26, of no fixed address but from Ipswich, denied robbing Mr Shilton on June 6. But they were found guilty after a trial at the court in September.

Poulter was jailed for three years and nine months and Hart was sentenced to three years and six months in prison.

'Cowards': The five men then continued to attack Mr Shilton as he lay defenceless on the ground

Injuries: Mr Shilton was left with a bruised kidney and several suspected broken ribs from the assault

Matthew Kersey, 30, of Ipswich, admitted robbing Mr Shilton and assaulting his friend Peter Scott. Jamie Duncan, 23, of Ipswich, admitted robbery.

Kersey was locked up for 32 months and Duncan for 30 months.

Mitchell Ambrose, 20, also of Ipswich, admitted robbery and will be sentenced at a later date.

The court heard that Mr Shilton had blood pouring from his mouth when he came round after being knocked out in the assault.

The traumatised serviceman ran to a nearby house for help and was taken to Ipswich Hospital with a bruised kidney, lumps on his head and suspected broken ribs.

Mr Shilton and Mr Scott were attacked on their night out after they met the gang, who invited them to a house party.

They got a taxi to the venue but decided to leave after discovering there was no party.

Mr Shilton, attached to the crack quick reaction unit, 16 Air Assault Brigade, got into a cab but jumped out again when he saw Mr Scott being chased by the yobs.

The cabbie sped off and Mr Shilton was surrounded by the five men as they demanded his wallet, phone and PIN number.

The frightened soldier handed them over thinking they would leave him alone but they started to punch him in the face.

Mr Shilton collapsed to the ground and was kicked repeatedly in the head and back.

Steven Dyble, defending Kersey, said he had written to the soldier to apologise. He said Kersey had been drinking.

Matthew Sorel-Cameron, for Duncan, said he accepted punching Mr Shilton and was ashamed.

Christopher Paxton, defending Poulter, said he had not threatened the victim or used any violence and had only played a peripheral role.

Ian Persaud, for Hart, said he had not menaced Mr Shilton or confronted him.

Det Insp Eamonn Bridger, of Suffolk Police, said: 'This was a particularly nasty unprovoked attack on the victim, a serving soldier on leave, who co-operated with the offenders and handed over his property.

'They still felt the need to surround him and assault him, causing him to fall to the ground unconscious.

'They then continued the assault whilst he lay vulnerable on the floor.'
