Two friends who claim to have captured vision of an Australian Bigfoot say they 'convinced' the elusive creature to appear on film by offering him a feast of apples.

The grainy early-morning video, shot in South Queensland on March 29, has sent an online community of Bigfoot hunters into a spin after the friends who filmed it claimed the clip is evidence of the mysterious Yowie - a mythical creature rumoured to roam the Aussie bush.

Jason Heal and Jason Dunn, self-described 'Yowie searchers', posted the vision to their YouTube account on April 5 and dubbed the strange creature with glowing eyes 'The Morning Visitor'.

'We'd been throwing him a few extra apples since he was willing to appear on camera,' Jason Heal told MailOnline.

'I'm somebody who believes in appreciation in life and if he's showing himself, we appreciate the fact.

'We even left a few apples without the camera and said "you can have the apples but we don't get the prize."'

He said the Yowie first appeared the Thursday afternoon before their early morning video by waving its 'black hairy arm' in front of the lens 'to see if it's going to set the camera off or not'.

Mr Heal said he and his partner have spent thousands of dollars hunting Yowies in the Australian bush and described the furry humanoids as 'very intelligent creatures'.

Their video has so far been watched more than 9,000 times. It is just the latest in a string of clips that have garnered the pair more than 1 million views on YouTube and inspired an article on the Cryptozoology News website.

'Even though the creature on the video certainly resembles a sloth, these animals are not native to any region of Australia and they are illegal to have as pets,' the article reads.

'The possibility of the video showing a big unidentified ape remains open.'

But readers are not so sure with many voicing their skepticism over the infrared vision, filmed at 3:27am.

'That’s a really neat-o mask that guy is wearing!' said Ira Shlamazel.

'Maybe if you moved the camera a little further away it wouldn’t be so obvious.'

User The Flinx joked: '1990 called, they want their hoax back'.

Michael Bachman, editor of Cryptozoology News, told MailOnline: 'At this point we have no idea whether the video is real or a hoax, but it has certainly captivated some viewers.'

The mixed opinion has angered the two Jasons who said they have invested time and money in their hunt for evidence of Australia's answer to the Sasquatch.

'Everyone's going crazy, saying it's a hoax, like we're putting lamps on our head,' said Mr Heal.

'You give them something real and they all turn around and say it's fake...we know they exist, we've done enough research.'

The duo do have a number of fans online. Paul Davies wrote: 'Excellent capture you guys fair play, all that time out in the bush has certainly paid off.'

Yowies have long been part of Australian folklore, with rumoured sightings dating back to the 18th century.

Internet sleuths often swap tales of encounters with the strange ape-like creatures who are said to stroll around the outback.
