Moments after last night's TV contest came off air, Labour's election chief Douglas Alexander was briefing journalists on how well his man had done. 

Without doubt Ed Miliband had won, he declared confidently. But he was cut off mid-sentence by news that the first poll was in, which told a different story.

Some 54 per cent of people thought David Cameron had triumphed, which is a slender win for the Tory camp who have grown complacent about the idea that Mr Miliband's dire personal ratings will stop his path to Number 10.

Two snap polls after the TV election contest gave David Cameron the lead - but only just

David Cameron and Ed Miliband were interviewed by Jeremy Paxman and questioned by an audience of voters as part of the first TV election contest of the campaign

Pollster ICM said its snap verdict giving a narrow victory for Mr Cameron in the first of the leaders' election broadcasts represented the company's 'best guess' of the nationwide response.

In is survey for the Guardian it found that 46 per cent  felt that Mr Cameron had the best arguments, as against 44 per cent who said the same of Mr Miliband.

The Prime Minister was judged marginally more convincing than the panel, by a difference of 48 per cent to 43 per cent. The ICM panel also felt Mr Cameron better answered the questions he was asked, winning on this measure by 44 per cent to 37 per cent.

In a boost for Labour,56 per cent of floating voters said they were more likely to vote Labour, compared with 30 per cent more likely to vote Conservative. 

However, those in this section of the group were only a very small sub-set of the wider group.

A separate YouGov App result found 51 per cent thought Mr Cameron won, with Mr Miliband on 49 per cent.

The two men vying for the keys to Number 10 on May 7 did not go head-to-head but instead appeared separately to be interviewed by Paxman and questioned by an audience of voters.

In an 18-minute grilling, Mr Cameron was forced to defend not cutting immigration while putting up VAT, questioned about the rise of food banks in Britain and his failure to spell out where £12billion in welfare cuts will come from.

Jeremy Paxman appears to scratch his head mid-way through interviewing Prime Minister David Cameron 

And he appeared taken aback when asked about the company he keeps, including a minister caught up in a tax scandal, a spin doctor jailed for phone hacking and being friends with Jeremy Clarkson, who was sacked from Top Gear after punching a colleague.

But Mr Miliband faced a difficult ride time from both the studio audience and Paxman about whether he is tough enough to lead the country.

The Labour leader insisted: 'Am I tough enough? Hell, yes, I'm tough enough.'

The contest was played out on social media, with almost every TV-related tweet sent last night discussing the election contest.

In a blog post, Twitter cited Kantar Media analysis stating the debate made up 94.7 per cent of UK Twitter conversation about TV over the evening, with more than 300,000 tweets sent by 10.15pm.

There were more mentions of Mr Cameron than Mr Miliband but Labour saw more mentions than the Conservatives, while the moment that generated the most tweets came at the end of the debate as Mr Paxman asked the Labour leader: 'Are you OK, Ed?' 

Ukip leader Nigel Farage and media mogul Rupert Murdoch were among those whose eyes were glued to Sky and Channel 4's much-anticipated question and answer session with David Cameron and Ed Miliband.

The debate accounted for 94.7 per cent of UK Twitter conversation about TV over the evening, with more than 300,000 tweets sent by 10.15pm

When the Labour leader declared he was tough enough to be prime minister by virtue of having stood up to Mr Murdoch, the News International owner tweeted: 'Thanks for 2 mentions, Ed Miliband. Only met once for all of 2 minutes when you embarrassed me with over the top flattery.'

Former Apprentice and Celebrity Big Brother star Katie Hopkins was not impressed with Miliband either, tweeting: 'If this man is Prime Minister I will leave the UK. This man is not Great Britain. This is Russell Brand in a chuffing suit.'

And Ann Summer's CEO Jacqueline Gold said: 'This is not the same Labour Party that people voted for under Blair. Miliband is like Kinnock without the personality.'

But Mr Farage had a kind word for his Labour counterpart, tweeting: 'Miliband is showing more humour and courage than Cameron! BattleForNumber10.'

But he attacked Mr Miliband over Europe and immigration and mocked Mr Cameron for being 'smarmy'.

The South Thanet parliamentary candidate said: 'His constant complimenting of audience for their questions is making Cameron look rather smarmy and lacking in sincerity.'

Tony Blair's former spin doctor Alastair Campbell felt it was good night for Mr Miliband.

He said: 'Good night for Ed, neutral for Kay, bad for Jeremy, dire for Dave.'

Others questioned Mr Paxman's skills as an interviewer, with Apprentice boss Lord Sugar tweeting: 'I think Miliband made mincemeat out of Paxman.'

Piers Morgan weighed in, tweeting: 'Paxman eviscerated Cameron with such masterful savagery ... that Cameron won all the debate polls.'

But Match Of The Day host Gary Lineker backed the former Newsnight anchor, saying: 'Audience questions after Paxman is like when Spurs bring on Soldado for Harry Kane.'

As did BBC presenter Andrew Neil: 'Paxo was superb tonight. But winging it towards end with Miliband. Seemed better prepared against Cameron.'

And he added: 'Miliband was struggling at times but viewers will perhaps think he stood up better to Paxo than the PM.'
