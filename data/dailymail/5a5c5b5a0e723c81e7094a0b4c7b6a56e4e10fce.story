It's not unusual for a British couple to escape the rat race by moving to France - but how about going back 75 years in time as well?

Barry and Caroline Selwood have sunk every penny they have into creating their own shrine to the decades either side of the Second World War.

But it doesn't end there, because the self-confessed eccentrics live as if it's the summer of 1939, complete with period clothes, furniture and a car all from the era.

Vintage style: Caroline and Barry drive a cream Sunbeam Talbot Ten in celebration of a bygone era

Unique time capsule: The couple have re-built a dilapidated riverside hotel in south west France

As it was: La Belle Epoque hotel in south west France as it first looked

Perfect spot: The hotel had been abandoned back in the 1950's in the beautiful village of Nanteuil-en-Vallee

'I guess they think we're just that crazy English couple who run the hotel.'

It all started in 2002 when stationery salesman Barry decided his life was going nowhere. He sold his home in Stevenage, Hertforshire, and headed for France where he'd worked on yachts on the Cote d'Azur as a young man.

He bought a tumble down farmhouse and set to work, but just a few months later on a trip back to England he met and fell for Caroline from Wokingham, Berkshire.

Barry said: 'I'd decided to give up on the rat race, I had a comfortable life as a salesman, but I wanted something different.

'I was working on my farmhouse which I loved, but I loved Caroline too. Luckily she made it easy for me and wanted to be with me in France.'

The couple found they both shared a passion for all things vintage. And, after a six-month-long distance relationship, Caroline gave up working as a nanny in London and moved to France. They married five years ago.

Stepping back in time: The pair visited vintage events to find authentic items to decorate the hotel

'We never really thought about how we'd manage,' Caroline said. 'We were young, carefree and in love and had a new and exciting life ahead of us.'The couple took seven to complete the renovation on the farmhouse. They knew their future lay in France and they loved their life in their home complete with swimming pool, but something was missing.

'We needed to find a property we could make into a business so we could support ourselves and live a sustainable life,' said Caroline.

Then four years ago they saw a dilapidated hotel which had been abandoned back in the 1950's in the beautiful village of Nanteuil-en-Vallee in the Charente.

Caroline said: 'It was love at first sight. It had been stood empty for four years and was derelict and forlorn.

'There were holes in the roof, water had been getting in for years and had taken a heavy toll.

Pretty unique: 'There isn't anything like it in the UK where vintage living is more popular', says Caroline

'We quickly realised we'd spent a large amount of our savings on a pile of rotten timber, collapsed ceilings and mouldy walls!

'And it soon became apparent the renovation budget we'd scribbled down over a couple of bottles of wine was total fantasy.'

Work started and for the first couple of years the couple felt like they were 'chipping away at a mountain with a toffee hammer'.

Things ground to a halt when Barry was installing a new staircase and he fell, shattering his arm, breaking his nose and a rib.

Despite the setback things eventually took shape and the pair knew what the hotel's theme would be. They'd visited vintage events in the UK whenever they could and had been hoarding items.

'But France was a fantastic hunting ground for furniture and paraphernalia, as were local brocantes,' said Barry.

'We trawled eBay for bits and pieces, some of which were perfect and some we got after auctions that ended at midnight. It became madness!'

Adding to the experience: The couple have just opened a tea room - and thankfully the bookings are coming in

Blowing the budget: 'We really didn't want to compromise. We wanted the house to appear how it would to people staying here 80 years or so ago', says Caroline

Caroline added: 'We really didn't want to compromise. We wanted the house to appear how it would to people staying here 80 years or so ago.

'We found it really satisfying to put a piece of furniture bought a couple of years before in the place we'd imagined it would go once we had finished the renovation.

'Now it's pretty unique thing in France and there isn't anything like it in the UK where vintage living is more popular.'

To help the business they've just opened a tea room too, to add to the whole experience. And thankfully the bookings are coming in.

'If we could go back in time, would we do the same again? Absolutely yes!' said Caroline. 'If we knew how much it would cost, then "No!" we'd never have started.

'But our advice to anyone in similar circumstances is "Go for it!" And if you happen to be installing a new staircase make sure it's properly secured before you venture up it!'
