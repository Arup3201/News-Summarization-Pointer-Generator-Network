A 13-year-old schoolboy exploded into a 'human fireball' after a piece of broken rope swing he was playing with hit a railway power cable.

Kieron Jenkinson suffered burns to 55 per cent of his body after being electrocuted with 25,000 volts as he crossed a railway bridge in Ayrshire, Scotland.

A witness said the explosion could be seen 'from half a mile away' as two adults rushed to the scene to put out the flames and wait for an ambulance to arrive.

Kieron Jenkinson, 13, has suffered 55 per cent burns to his body after a piece of broken rope swing he was playing with hit railway power cables 

Witnesses said Kieron turned into a 'human fireball' after he was struck with 25,000 volts. His sister Lisa, 24 (right), rushed to the scene after seeing messages on Facebook, but he had already been taken to hospital

Kieron has since had two major operations and is expected to remain in a coma for several days in hospital, where his condition is described as serious but stable.

The accident happened on Tuesday night after Kieron and a friend had been playing on a rope swing which broke.

The pair then took the broken rope with them as they crossed a railway bridge. As Kieron played with it, the rope hit some railway power lines, causing him to burst into flames.

People living near to the line described hearing a loud bang, followed by darkness as the power surge caused lights to go out.

Kieron was found groaning on the ground by two passersby who called the emergency services.

His sister Lisa, 24, learned of the accident after seeing posts on Facebook at around 7.40pm but by the time she arrived at the scene, Kieron was already gone.

Kieron was taken to hospital where doctors performed two major surgeries, one to release a build-up of blood in his leg. He is expected to remain in a coma until Saturday at the earliest

His mother, Donna Graham, 50, told the Daily Record: 'The police came to the door just after 8pm and told me Kieron was seriously injured and took me to the hospital. We have all been in pieces.

'The officer said he had never seen in his 28 years of service someone being able to speak after that amount of voltage went through him. He is obviously a real fighter.'

Kieron was taken to nearby Crosshouse hospital before being transferred to Glasgow Royal Infirmary where doctors performed two major surgeries, one to release a build-up of blood in his leg which could have developed into a serious clot.

The schoolboy, who attends Ardrossan Academy and is an avid football fan, is expected to remain in a coma until Saturday at the earliest.

Ms Graham said that doctors are still assessing damage to her son's internal organs, and described his recovery as a 'long haul.'

She is also trying to identify a man and woman who stopped to help Kieron, adding that the knowledge he wasn't alone was a comfort to her.

British Transport Police are investigating the incident and are urging anyone who witnessed the accident to come forward.
