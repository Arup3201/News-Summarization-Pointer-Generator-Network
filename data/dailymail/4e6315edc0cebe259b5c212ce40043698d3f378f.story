An Oakland Athletics pitcher has gone from the joy of welcoming his first son into the world to mourning his tragic death in just 23 short hours, sharing every moment of his emotional journey with his fans.

Gehrig John Neshek was born weighing 8lbs, 5oz, to parents Pat Neshek, 32, and wife Stephanee on Tuesday, October 2, 2012, but the boy did not make it through the night, passing away in his mother's arms of an unknown condition.

'Please pray for my family,' Mr Neshek tweeted yesterday evening. 'Tonight my wife & I lost our first & only son 23 hours after he was born with no explanation.'

The baseball player flew from Oakland to Florida to witness the birth of his first child.

'Thinking of the long nights in AAA, my TJ surgery & the days when I thought it was over..Makes this the sweetest playoff birth of my career!' Mr Neshek tweeted on October 1, just hours before he met his son.

'What a day, my wife is now in labor!'

He added the hashtag '#playoffbaby' to the end of the enthusiastic tweet.

Mr Neshek rushed to the hospital straight from his team's first playoff game against the Texas Rangers, who they defeated 4 to 3.

'It's a boy Gehrig John Neshek...8 lbs 5
oz, born 10/2/12. Pat flew Oakland to FL just in time for birth! 
#playoffbaby,' Mrs Neshek tweeted, adding a photograph of the family 
together.

The boy was undoubtedly named after the famous and inspiring Yankees player Lou Gehrig.

She thanked all the people that 
reached out to the couple and offered their condolences, saying that it 
'made her heart feel better' so many people were affected by Gehrig's 
short time in the world.

'There was no cause of death and I am having trouble understanding why God can let such a thing happen an innocent being,' she said. 'Every kind word helps.'

The Oakland A's also offered the Neshek's their thoughts and prayers.

'Our hearts go out to Pat and Stephanee and we share in their sorrow of losing their young son,' the A’s said.

'The entire A’s organization will 
keep the Neshek family in our prayers and thoughts, as they try to come 
to grips with this tragic occurrence in their lives.'
