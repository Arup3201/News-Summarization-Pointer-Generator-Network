A PCSO who helped organise stranger danger awareness days for school kids has been told he faces jail for a string of sex attacks on children.

Gary Hastings, 48, admitted the offences and has been warned he faces a 'lengthy prison sentence' after appearing at York Crown Court.

He pleaded guilty to seven charges of sexual activity with two children both of whom were under 16.

Hastings had helped organise a ‘Kids And Cops’ event for schoolchildren in Immingham, Lincolnshire, where he advised kids of the danger of strangers during school holidays.

At York Crown Court he denied two charges of causing one of the children to be involved in prostitution and pornography. These charges were left to lie on file.

The chairman of governors at Canon Peter Hall Primary School, in Immingham, released a statement that said: 'This is devastating and disappointing.

Condemned: PCSO Gary Hastings

'Police personnel are taken on trust.'

Immingham councillor Dave Bolton said: 'It is a terrible shock. I always thought he was a nice guy, but clearly he isn’t. I hope he gets 20 years.'

Immingham Town Council clerk, Dave Jackson, said: 'The council works closely with the town’s PCSOs and Gary regularly visited us.

'I always found him to be polite and helpful.'

Parents in the Lincolnshire town spoke of their shock at the revelation.

Mother-of-one Sophie Seeley 26, said: 'It is good to know he will be off the streets. It is disgusting.

'He was in a position of trust and he was allowed to be with our children. He was in the ideal role to get away with it.

'It makes you think how many others are out there. If he was able to get the job that he did, you have to worry about others your children come into contact with.

'You cannot trust anyone with your children.

Mother-of-two Kylie Brophy, 24, said: 'It is disgusting. How did end up in the job he had?'

Another mum who does voluntary youth work and did not wish to be identified said: 'It is disappointing to find out someone in a position of trust has been charged with these offences and admitted it.

'The remaining PCSOs are going to find it more difficult because people will put barriers up.

'It will make an already challenging job even more difficult. His actions have compromised the role of others in the community because it is all about people’s perceptions.'

She added: 'I have always advised my children that if they ever got into any trouble in town they should get help from a PCSO. They may think twice now.'

Admission: PCSO Gary Hastings will be sentenced at York Crown Court
