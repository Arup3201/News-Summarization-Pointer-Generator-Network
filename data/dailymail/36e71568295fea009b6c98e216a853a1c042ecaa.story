An eco-warrior has built a giant nesting box to live inside as part of a protest to stop trees being felled on a green belt of land.

Dav Kahyk, 35, built the replica 6ft by 3ft plywood box - complete with a perch and circular entrance - in a bid to protect the wooded area in Stapleton, Bristol.

Other protesters have set up netted hammocks between trees at risk of being axed, but Mr Kahyk decided to build the warmer structure as a symbol of their campaign.

The trees are in the path of a controversial MetroBus route through Bristol and are due to be chopped down.

Mr Kahyk, who is a tree surgeon, said: 'I've been climbing and rigging all day to get everything into place for another evening here.

'It is a 6ft by 3ft platform and on top there is a bird box about 6ft high on top of it.

'We decided to build the bird box as we thought it would prove why we are here - we are trying to prove that chopping down trees will take away wildlife's homes.

The bird box is on a 6ft by 3ft platform (left) while other platforms have been constructed on opposite trees

A sign hangs between the trees, which are due to be felled, calling for the council to 'Redesign MetroBus'

'We're all living things, so if they decide to chop the trees down they will have to take the home with it.' 

'There are two of us in there at the moment, but we've decided we're going to start taking it in turns.

'Everyone else is just sleeping in nets in the trees so this is much more luxurious - it's like a Hilton Hotel.'

He added: 'It took us about a day to build. It is made completely of recyclable items. Plywood, carpet and lino.

'It took us an evening to build the platform and then it took us a day to build the building around it.'

Protesters moved on to the allotments at the start of them month to protest against plans to fell trees after plans were made for the MetroBus route.

They have been using hot water bottles and extra jumpers to keep warm and say they 'huddle round like penguins'

As well as platforms in the trees and hammocks between them, protesters have set up camp on the ground due to be cleared to make way for the new bus route

A High Court judge has now ruled that the group can be evicted from the land and bailiffs are set to move in over the weekend.

Mr Kahyk, from Bristol, added: 'We've been here for five nights now. Maybe six actually, the days are all kind of merging into one.

'We will be staying here until we are physically removed by baliffs or they listen to us and decide against the scheme.

'We're keeping warm in the box with hot water bottles and extra jumpers, we're all huddled around like penguins.

'The bird box is much warmer than the outdoor nets, we've had a cold few nights so everyone wants the bird box.'  

The replica 6ft by 3ft plywood box is made entirely from recycled materials - plywood, carpet and lino
