A man whose brother died during the Falklands war is to retrace his footsteps almost 30 years on from the conflict.

In 1982, Royal Marine Gordon MacPherson was killed during the battle for Two Sisters, and now his brother David plans to make an arduous 75-mile journey past the spot in tribute.

Mr MacPherson was 19 when he lost his brother, who was 20 and had been a Royal Marine for just a year.

Loving memory: Left, Gordon and David MacPherson at their home in Argyll in March 1982, shortly before the Marine left for the Falklands. Right, David training for his Falklands challenge this year

Gordon MacPherson, from Oban, Argyll, died alongside comrade Corporal Frank Spencer during the battle. Both served with Zulu Company, 45 Commando, Royal Marines, which is based in Arbroath.

David MacPherson and Mike Cole, who was the company commander in 1982, are now about to travel the original 120km (75 mile) route across East Falkland and will pay their respects at Two Sisters.

The men will be laden with heavy kit for the long journey - a Marine practice known as a 'yomp' - and will cover 17 miles each day in wintry conditions.

When Mr MacPherson and Mr Cole reach Two Sisters, on their way from Port San Carlos to Stanley, they will stop for a ceremony in honour of the fallen Marines.

A piper from The Highlanders, 4th Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Scotland (4 SCOTS), is expected to play Nam Anna Le Mo Smaointe, a Gaelic song which means 'Alone With My Thoughts' and was written for Gordon after he died by family friends Erik Spence and the Reverend John MacLeod.

Tragic death: Gordon MacPherson with 9 Troop, Zulu Company, on HMS Intrepid, two days before the landing at San Carlos Water in May 1982

It will be the first time Mr MacPherson has visited the Falklands and the second time Mr Cole has returned to the battlefield since the night of June 11, 1982.

The idea for the yomp came from Cpl 
Spencer's son Simon, but he and his brother, Gareth, are no longer able 
to take part for family reasons.

The pair, who will be joined by Colour Sergeant Trevor Law, a Royal Marine serving in the Falklands, are now gearing up for the challenge, which starts on May 13.

They will be carrying equipment weighing about 20kg and raising money for the Royal Marines Charitable Trust Fund during the challenge.

They have had a royal seal of approval from the Duke of Edinburgh, who sent them a letter of support last week.

Mr MacPherson, a painter and decorator from Oban, said: 'I'm a 49-year-old civilian, so it's all new to me.

'I'd
 like to think I was already reasonably fit but I've had to try and get 
much fitter for this as it is going to be very difficult.

'My
 wife and her friends are running the Glasgow 10k on May 13, the same 
day that we start the yomp, and they're raising money for the same 
charity.

'I never 
thought I would get the opportunity to do anything like this. It's the 
first and probably the only time I will go to the Falklands.'

Mr
 Cole, 64, from Dorset, said he is taking part in the trip in memory of 
his two fallen comrades but that the most important thing for him is to 
support Mr MacPherson.

Mr Cole, who now works at RNAS Yeovilton for the Ministry of Defence, recalled his last memory of Gordon MacPherson.

He said: 'Gordon wasn't very big physically but he was very determined.

'I remember just before we moved out of the patrol base after receiving orders for the attack, we were getting our kit ready and he was putting on a huge pack.

'I jokingly asked if he was going to be okay with it.

'He gave me one of those looks, and I knew of course that there was never going to be any problem there. That's the last time I remember seeing him.'

He added: 'We were delighted to receive a letter from HRH the Duke of Edinburgh, as Captain General Royal Marines, commending us and wishing us luck on our expedition, which he indicated was a unique and fitting tribute to Corporal Spencer and Marine MacPherson.'
