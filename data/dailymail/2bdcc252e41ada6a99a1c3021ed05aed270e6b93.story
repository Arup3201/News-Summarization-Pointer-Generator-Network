A hound called Coco has become caught up in a remarkable international custody battle after being ‘rescued’ by a couple who are now facing a lawsuit from a woman claiming to be the rightful owner.

Coco was found wandering a beach in Aruba, in the Caribbean Sea, last October by husband and wife Lisa and Dan O’Connell, who claimed she was in shocking condition.

The O’Connells, from North Attleboro in Massachusetts, said that they thought she was a stray.

Coco was found wandering around on a beach in Aruba, in the Caribbean Sea, last October by husband and wife Lisa (pictured) and Dan O’Connell, who claimed she was in shocking condition

An Aruba resident called Cornelia Hajdinyak told the O’Connells that Coco was actually hers – and called Whitey Pinky. She has set up a Facebook page to support her claim

Ms O’Connell told WBZ-TV: ‘She was dehydrated, she seemed hungry, she seemed sad. She absolutely looked like a dog that nobody was caring for.’

Husband Dan added: ‘The dog had many ticks on it and its paws were raw, either from the hot sand or the hot asphalt.’

They both claim that the dog wasn’t wearing a collar and that no other form of identification was visible.

Believing that they were being good Samaritans, they called a vet to get the dog treated then contacted an Aruba animal rescue centre to help process adoption of Coco.

However, when they returned from their vacation they received a message from an Aruba resident called Cornelia Hajdinyak who told the O’Connells that Coco was actually hers – and called Whitey Pinky.

The O’Connells launched a crowd-funding page to help pay their legal bill and keep the dog stateside

Ms Hajdinyak, in a Facebook page to support her claim, said that Whitey Pinky ‘only lives two minutes from the beach’ and is used to going there ‘with her best friends Buddy and Wolly, which live just next door'  that they 'all know their way home’. 

As well as posting photographs and videos of the dog on the page, she published emails that she’d written to the O’Connells, describing how she found her in 2011 at the front of her house and adopted her.

She wrote: '[Whitey Pinky] loves running, hiking, walking, swimming, bicycling, being on a boat, catamaran or jetski, driving in the car; there is nothing she doesn't want to be part of!'

She claims that the dog was 'confiscated' within two days by the O'Connells, leaving little time for a proper search, but they argue that Hajdinyak waited two weeks before she began looking for her. 

The O’Connells remain determined to keep Coco, who they’ve become very fond of.

They believe that returning her ‘would put her life in jeopardy’.

Now both sides have brought in lawyers in a bid to secure custody of the animal and the case is set to be settled in court.

The O’Connells launched a crowd-funding page to help pay their legal bill, which has reached several thousand dollars.
