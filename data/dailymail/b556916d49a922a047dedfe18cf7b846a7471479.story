EU prepares to seize assets of individuals and firms linked to Assad's regime

At least 10,224 people, including over 5,000 children have crossed the border to Turkey

Hundreds more Syrian civilians were forced to flee into Turkey after government troops mounted a crackdown close to the border today.

Soldiers moved closer in to the border zone and took down a Turkish flag that had been raised at a look-out post on the Syrian side of the border.

Nearly 100 Syrians, who were living in makeshift tents, fled into Turkey as soldiers closed in around the border village of Khirbet al-Jouz.

Turkish authorities have responded by placing armed guards along their side of the border.

Thousands of refugees have been flooding into Turkey as the Syrian government tries to crush the three-month-old uprising.

The regime blames foreign conspirators and thugs for the unrest.

Local sources reported that tanks had entered the border village of Khirbet al-Jouz and snipers were spotted on rooftops looking out over the nearby refugee camp.

Syria has banned foreign journalists and restricted local media, making it nearly impossible to independently confirm the accounts.

The European Union is 
planning to hit the Syrian regime with more sanctions, targeting the 
assets of seven more individuals and four companies with connections to President Bashar al-Assad.

Journalists on the Turkish side of the border have reported seeing armed men near the village and an armoured personnel carrier on its outskirts.

The opposition estimates 1,400 people have been killed and 10,000 detained in the Syrian crackdown, drawing international condemnation and sanctions.

According to the Turkish ministry of disaster and emergency management, at least 10,224 people, including over 5,000 children have crossed the border from Syria to Turkey.

On Wednesday, the Syrian regime lashed out at European governments for threatening a new round of sanctions and accused the West of trying to sow chaos and conflict in the Arab nation.

But Foreign Minister Walid Moallem 
also reiterated the president's call for national dialogue and spoke of 
democracy over the horizon - a bold assertion after more than four 
decades of iron-fisted rule by the family of President Bashar Assad and 
months of bloody reprisals.

The EU also has an embargo on sales of arms and equipment that can be used to suppress demonstrations.

Moallem said the suggestion 'amounts to (an act) of war' and warned 'we will forget that Europe is on the map'.
