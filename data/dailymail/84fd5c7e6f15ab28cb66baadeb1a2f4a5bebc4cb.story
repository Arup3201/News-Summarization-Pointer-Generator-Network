A pair of 'lawless' schoolboy gang leaders who terrorised elderly people in their neighbourhood have been ordered by a court to 'grow up' or face jail.

Ali Iqbal and Haider Farooq - who dubbed themselves 'the Invincibles' - were the leaders of aÂ  gang of youths that ran rampage around Brierfield in Lancashire; smashing windows, vandalising cars, and deliberately intimidating vulnerable people and pensioners.

Local residents described how the 16-year-olds turned the area into 'hell on earth', leaving some elderly people too terrified to step outside their front doors.

Iqbal and Farooq were named and shamed at Reedley Magistrates' Court today, as they were served with a two-year ASBO and threatened with up to five years in jail unless they start to behave.

The pair, who swore at passersby outside the court, had been convicted of attempted theft and criminal damage at earlier hearings.

Details of their campaign of intimidation emerged after victims agreed to keep diaries of their ordeals over an eight-month period.

The court heard how the pair raided local buses taking hammers that were in place in case of emergencies, stole wheelie bins, and jumped on cars.

A JP told the duo - who police said 'had no respect for anyone or anything' - the order was their 'last chance'.

Farooq said at today's hearing: 'No more messing about.'

JP Brian Pickup replied: 'You need 
to really grow up while you have got the chance before the authorities 
take the view that you need to be put somewhere that can impose some 
sort of discipline.

'It is not really the right words "messing about".

'Taking hammers, breaking windows, damaging cars, you would realise the potential if that happened to you.

'If you parked your car outside and 
it got smashed by someone, would you just think "he is only messing 
about"? I think you would take a slightly different view,' Mr Pickup 
said,.

'Have you thought about the consequences, causing your mother and family heartache?' the JP went on.

'This is your last chance, maybe down
the line in six to 12 months the order will be adjusted, if not you are
going to suffer. Make sure you go away and are a credit to your 
families.'

After the case police and neighbours said both teenagers - who had been excluded from mainstream education - had brought 'hell on earth' to the area.

They had initially been offered 'acceptable behaviour' contracts to avoid court action - but refused to sign. PC Tony Feather said: 'They think they are invincible and called themselves as much, and they believed it was acceptable to go on a rampage targeting vulnerable and elderly people. It has just escalated, they have no respect for anyone or anything.

'They built up an entourage of youngsters and smashed up buses and house windows and frightened residents. They have been the focal point of a lot of anti-social behaviour and brought terror to their own neighbourhood because they felt comfortable doing it on their own doorstep,' the officer said.Widower Doreen Baxendale, 76, a retired weaver, said: 'Those two boys are utterly lawless and have no respect for the elders. We never behaved like that at their age.

'They fight, shout and swear and jump on cars and other things. It's appalling.

'They have even been banging on my door at 2am in the morning and I've had to call the police. It's frightening because I live by myself and they make everyone feel very uncomfortable in their own community,' Mrs Baxendale added.

Thomas Bamford, 48, said: 'I have to carry a safety alarm with me if I go out because I am scared of them. I don't tend to leave the house at night.

'They are well known. They kick my doors and have done a lot of damage around here. They take the wheelie bins and smash stuff, they even smashed my windows with stones. I feel very uneasy when young lads are hanging around.'

The order will prevent the boys from associating with four other males in a public place in Pendle for two years.

They are also prohibited from a mapped area of Pendle - which also includes their residential area - unless accompanied by an adult aged 18 or over.

Local Labour Councillor Nawaz Ahmed said: 'These boys were involved in disgraceful behaviour and we have put up with these problems for too long.

'The lads are going around making a nuisance and the community will not tolerate it. This is the only area in Pendle where crime has increased, everywhere else has decreased.

'I also believe this is the parents' responsibility as well. I hope this will deter them and others too. Residents are fed up, the boys are out every night bringing fear to the area and insulting people. It is not fair. I hope this puts them back on the straight and narrow,' the councillor said.
