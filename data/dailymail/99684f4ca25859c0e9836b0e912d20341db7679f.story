The cricket world was in a state of shock on Thursday night as it struggled to come to terms with the death of Phillip Hughes, who never regained consciousness after being hit by a ball and collapsing while batting in a Sheffield Shield match.

The news that cricket had been dreading ever since the horrific incident at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Tuesday came early on Thursday morning when it was confirmed the Australian batsman had lost the biggest fight of his young life. 

Australia team doctor Peter Brukner broke the news at the city’s St Vincent’s Hospital, where Hughes had been placed in an induced coma after emergency surgery on his brain following extensive treatment on the SCG outfield.

Michael Clarke, Australia’s captain and a close friend of Hughes, had kept vigil at the hospital alongside Hughes’ family for much of the 48 hours following the incident. He read out a statement on behalf of the stricken batsman’s parents Greg and Virginia and his brother and sister Jason and Megan.

‘We are devastated by the loss of our much-loved son and brother Phillip,’ read Clarke. ‘It has been a very difficult few days. We appreciated all the support we have received from family, friends, players, Cricket Australia and the public.’

Clarke, struggling to contain his emotion, added: ‘Cricket was Phillip’s life and we as a family shared that love of the game with him. We would like to thank all the medical and nursing staff at St Vincent’s Hospital and Cricket NSW medical staff for their great efforts with Phillip. We love you.’

It emerged that Hughes, who would have been 26 on Sunday, was the victim of a freak injury when he was hit in the neck attempting to pull a delivery from young New South Wales bowler Sean Abbott while batting for South Australia.

When Hughes, who had been expected to return to the Australia Test side against India next week after an 18-month absence, was struck below his helmet at the back of his head, one of the main arteries to his brain was compressed.

‘The impact caused the vertebral artery to split and for bleeding to go up into the brain,’ said Dr Brukner. ‘Phillip had a massive bleed into his brain. This was a freakish accident and this type of injury is incredibly rare.

Test matches have been played for almost 140 years but deaths are very rare in cricket, although Phillip Hughes is the second player in two years to sustain a fatal blow.

Darryn Randall, who was 32 and a former first-class player in South Africa, was killed after being struck on the side of the head during a domestic match in the Eastern Cape last year.

In 1998, former India Test player Raman Lamba died after being struck on the head while fielding during a match in Bangladesh. Nottinghamshire’s George Summers died after being hit on the head while batting at Lord’s in 1870, and Abdul Aziz died after he was hit over the heart in a 1959 Pakistan first-class match.

‘If you look at the literature there have only been around 100 cases ever reported and only one of those was caused by being hit by a cricket ball. Yes, we have to review our procedures and equipment but it is a very unusual injury.’

Hughes had briefly put his hands on his knees after being struck by the unfortunate Abbott, who has been offered counselling by Cricket Australia, and then collapsed face first to the ground before medics rushed on to the outfield. ‘The head injury that he suffered was catastrophic,’ said Dr Tony Grabs, the trauma director at St Vincent’s, who said that Hughes had 80 minutes of surgery but showed little improvement before he died.

Fears had grown for the left-handed batsman, who played in 26 Tests, as a procession of team-mates, friends and Australian greats like Ricky Ponting and Steve Waugh visited Hughes in hospital and left in tears or grim faced.

The visitors also included Abbott, who had made his international Twenty20 debut for Australia alongside Hughes against Pakistan in Dubai just six weeks ago and who now has to contend with his unwitting part in this tragedy.

Former England bowler David Lawrence was in a similar situation to Abbott when he struck West Indies batsman Phil Simmons — who also had to undergo emergency brain surgery — in a tour match at Bristol 26 years ago.

‘What gave me comfort was that I was able to see Phil Simmons 48 hours later and he told me it wasn’t my fault,’ said Lawrence. ‘The bowler in this instance wasn’t able to do that so my thoughts go out to him, too. Personally, I don’t think he’ll play cricket again.’

Play in the third Test between New Zealand and Pakistan in Sharjah was abandoned for the day while India’s tour match in Adelaide ahead of next week’s scheduled first Test was cancelled.

England’s one-day international against Sri Lanka on Saturday will go ahead after a two-minute silence in honour of Hughes. Australia’s rugby players will wear black armbands when they face England at Twickenham.

The Australian cricketers will hold a meeting before deciding whether next Thursday’s Test will go ahead, with Cricket Australia likely to leave the decision up to individuals like Brad Haddin, David Warner and Nathan Lyon, who were playing for New South Wales when the accident happened and comforted Hughes during his 40 minutes treatment.

Cricket now faces an anxious spell of introspection while it considers what, if anything, can be done to make the game safer.

Hughes was wearing a 2013 Masuri helmet which has marginally less protection than their newer model, but no helmet on the market would have been likely to save him. This means that a redesign will be looked at.

‘This will re-focus the way we look to develop our range,’ said Nick Wilton, who helps to design helmets for Gray-Nicolls. ‘This sad, sad case will ensure that everything is looked at again.’
