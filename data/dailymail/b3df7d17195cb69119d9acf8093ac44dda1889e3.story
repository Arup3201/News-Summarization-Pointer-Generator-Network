With 12 bacon rashers, 12 sausages, eight eggs, four pounds of spam and much more, this breakfast feast is being offered for free by one Rochdale cafe - but only if you manage to eat it all.

The man versus food-style challenge is being served up at the Castle Cafe but, despite numerous attempts, the monster plate has yet to be conquered.

For £15, hungry punters can try to munch their way through two packs of sausages, an entire pack of bacon, the eggs and spam, as well as six black puddings, four hash browns, a mound of tomatoes, a huge portion of beans, nearly a loaf's worth of toast and an omelette.

Hungry? Customer Simon Coyle becomes the latest person to fail the Castle Cafe's breakfast challenge, which asks participants to wolf down the 6,000-calorie feast in under an hour

The challenge is to get it all down within an hour to get it free but, so far, all have failed.

And, judging from these pictures, it is hard to see the challenge ever being completed.

In the American show Man vs Food, presenter Adam Richman takes on food challenges involving huge quantities of food, such as a five-pound-sandwich.
