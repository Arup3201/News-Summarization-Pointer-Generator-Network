A 'fatberg' the length of a Boeing 747 was discovered underneath the streets of west London - and workers were forced to spend four days tackling the vile mass.

The congealed lump - formed from fat, wet wipes and other litter wrongly put down drains and toilets - was detected under a 260ft stretch of a road in Shepherd’s Bush.

A team of sewer experts from Thames Water spent most of last week breaking it down.

Revolting: The congealed lump - formed from fat, wet wipes and other litter wrongly put down drains and toilets - was detected under a 260ft stretch of a road in Shepherd’s Bush

The immense, solid blockage was removed using high-powered water jets and then taken from the sewer to prevent flooding to nearby homes and business.

Dave Dennis, Thames Water sewer operations manager, said: 'We have 108,000km (67,108 miles) of sewers, and that’s a lot of pipe to keep clear. We spend £12million a year tackling blockages, most of them formed because people have tipped cooking fats down the drain and wet wipes down the loo.

'The sewers serve an important purpose - they are not an abyss for household rubbish. Fat goes down the drain easily enough, but when it hits the cold sewers, it hardens into disgusting fatbergs that block pipes.'

People pouring cooking fat away and flushing wet wipes has sparked an increase in the number of 'fatbergs'

He added: 'Wet wipes cling to the fat. Fat clings to the wipes. And pretty soon your fatberg is out of control and sewage is backing up into roads, gardens and in the worst cases flooding up through toilets and into homes.

'We’ve found all sorts in this sewer – from tennis balls to planks of wood . It goes without saying they shouldn’t be in those pipes. London – bin it, don’t block it.'

Despite the scale of the fatberg, the residents of Shepherd’s Bush will have to go a long way to go to beat the town of Kingston, who had a 15-tonne fatberg removed from a sewer last year.

The blockage was so critical at one point it threatened to blast the covers off manholes in Kingston with raw sewage.
