This tiny feline could be about to enter the record books as the world's shortest cat.

Tiffani Kjeldergaard from Potrero, California, is confident that her cat Pixel is no more than five inches tall, although she's yet to get official confirmation from Guinness.

If it is verified, then Pixel snatch the title of shortest adult cat to have ever lived, from Cye, a 5.35in tall Napoleon Munchkin cat from Canada. 

The average house cat is nine to ten inches tall.

Trouble: Pixel's owner says she has to take extra special care to avoid treading on her Munchkin cats

Ms Kjeldergaard said her family of Munchkin cats 'win hearts over like crazy.'

She said: 'Even people that aren't cat people go crazy for them. They say about how cute they are and how they want to take them straight home with them.'

A relatively new breed which was only recognised by The International Cat Association in 1995, Munchkin cats are characterised by their short legs, which are caused by a naturally occurring genetic mutation.

They was controversy when they first emerged, with some critics voicing concern over potential health problems. But Ms Kjeldergaard dismissed those concerns.

'People who don't understand the gene consider it a genetic defect or mutation or something of an abomination,' she said.

'It's very unfair for them to say that. It's natural for these cats to be this tall, just like it's natural for some people to have brown eyes - it wouldn't be wrong for them to have blue eyes.

'It's their build and it's natural for them to be built this way.'

However, she did concede that such tiny cats could cause problems around the house.

'You can't leave doors open, you can't close refrigerator doors too quickly because one of them may have snuck up at the bottom of the door and stuck their head in,' she said.

'We have to move very slowly when we walk so we don't step on anybody.

'Everyone of them has been stepped on or kicked once because it's just what happens in a house of munchkin cats.'

Ms Kjeldergaard is now waiting for verification from Guinness before Pixel can enter the record books. If she is accepted she would be following in a family tradition; her mother, Fizz Girl, set a previous record in 2012, at a height of six inches.
