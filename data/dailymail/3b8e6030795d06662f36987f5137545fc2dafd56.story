The mom of a gay detective has been kicked out of a church in Collegedale, Tennessee, she has attended for six decades because she refused to condemn her daughter.

Linda Cooper was informed by elders at Ridgedale Church of Christ on Sunday that her recent public support for Kat Cooper goes against the church's teachings.

She, together with her brother and sister, were given an ultimatum: They could repent for their sins and ask forgiveness in front of the congregation or leave the church.

The siblings decided to go, leaving an organization that they’ve been connected with since they were born. Their sin was Linda’s public show of support for daughter Kat, a detective with the Collegedale Police Department.

Earlier this month Kat successfully fought for health benefits for her same-sex spouse, Krista, from the town.

The landmark victory generated substantial media interest in the state as Collegedale became the first city in Tennessee to introduce same-sex partner benefits.

Throughout the process, Linda Cooper stood by her daughter's side. She held her daughter's hand at a July meeting over the issue and mother and daughter embraced after the City Council's 4-1 vote on August 5.

But those public acts of support didn't impress church elders who have decreed that the Coopers aren't welcome in the church that they've been a part of for more than 60 years.

‘My mother was up here and she sat beside me. That's it,’ Kat Cooper told the Times Free Press.

‘Literally, they're exiling members for unconditionally loving their children - and even extended family members.’

Speaking on behalf of his wife, Hunt Cooper said she feels she has committed no sin.

‘There was nothing to repent about. They
 certainly couldn't judge her on that because that was between her and 
her God, and it was not their place to judge her for that,’ he told CNN.

Kat Cooper says her mom has been exiled by the church for showing her daughter unconditional love, while Hunt Cooper says his wife is traumatized over how she has been treated

Hunt Cooper said his wife is devastated at being forced out of the church she loves.

'She is just so traumatized and so upset,' he said. 'It has been days and she's still crying. It's almost like losing a family member.'

Linda Cooper's father was once an elder at the church, his picture still hangs on the wall, and Kat Cooper grew up helping her grandfather clean the pews.

Church minister Ken Willis has admitted the news is 'getting mixed reviews,' but said he didn't wish to speak further as 'this is an in-church private issue.'

'The church is overseen by elders. I am a minister, not a pastor and therefore, do not have the authority to speak further on this,' he said.
