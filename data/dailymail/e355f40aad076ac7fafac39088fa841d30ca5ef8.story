Real Madrid will face either Mexican side Cruz Azul or the yet to be determined club champions of Asia in the semi-finals of the Club World Cup in December.

The Champions League winners are three-times victors of the tournament in its previous guise as the Intercontinental Cup, and will be heavy favourites going into this year's event to be held in Morocco.  

Their opponents in the semi-finals could yet be one of three clubs, with Cruz Azul having already booked a quarter-final place against Western Sydney Wanderers from Australia or Al-Hilal of Saudi Arabia, who  still have the second leg of the Asian Champions League Final to play.

In the other half of the draw South American champions San Lorenzo of Argentina could face one of four sides.

Moroccan league winners Moghreb Tetouan have been entered to represent the host nation, but must first overcome the challenge of Oceania champions Auckland City in a play-off that will open the tournament on December 10.

That will determine the quarter-final opponents for the winners of the African Champions League, with the final between ES Setif of Algeria and AS Vita Club from DR Congo also to be concluded on November 1.
