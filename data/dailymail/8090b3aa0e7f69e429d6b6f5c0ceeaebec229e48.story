City dealers promised to send each other champagne, Ferraris and free curry as they rigged crucial interest rates.

The details emerged yesterday as British broking giant ICAP was fined £54million by UK and US authorities over the so-called Libor scandal.

Brokers spoke about lavishing each other with gifts as they helped to skew the interbank lending rate.

Caught out: ICAP, founded by former Conservative party treasurer Michael Spencer, is the first broker to be fined for involvement in the Libor scandal

In emails between them, one dubbed 
himself ‘Lord Libor’ and one ‘Lord Bailiff’ while another boasted: ‘As 
for kickbacks etc we can discuss that at lunch’.

ICAP
is the latest corporate giant to be hauled before regulators over the 
global conspiracy. The company will pay fines totalling £54million after
being censured by a US  watchdog and Britain’s Financial Conduct 
Authority.

Three former brokers at the firm now also face criminal charges in the US and could each serve 30 years in jail.

Britons
Daniel Wilkinson and Colin Goodman and New Zealand-based Darrell Read 
are accused of ‘showing a cavalier disregard’ for the interests of the 
markets.

ICAP’s involvement
may also be embarrassing for Prime Minister David Cameron, who is an 
ally of the firm’s boss Michael Spencer.

Mr Spencer has donated around 
£2.6million to the Conservative Party and worked as its Treasurer until 
2010. Last night Mr Cameron faced calls from Labour to hand the 
donations back. Mr Spencer said he felt ‘an absolute sense of revulsion’
at the behaviour of his former staff but said he had not considered 
resigning.

‘It becomes a 
dangerous world if the head of a company has to take responsibility for 
activities of which he has no knowledge at all in a big organisation,’ 
he said.

Under pressure: The prosecution has sparked calls for David Cameron to hand over more than £4million of party donations from ICAP founder and former Tory party treasurer Michael Spencer

John Mann, the MP for Bassetlaw, has called for all previous donations from Michael Spencer and his company go to Armed forces charities

Regulators believe 
that ICAP’s London brokers manipulated Libor for the Japanese yen to 
help a trader from Swiss bank UBS make millions of dollars on financial 
markets.

Between 2006 and 
2011, ICAP’s brokers allegedly emailed ‘skewed’ suggestions to other 
banks about what they thought the rate for the day should be.

Some
banks were also urged to submit higher or lower rates based on which 
way the UBS trader – confirmed by sources last night as Thomas Hayes – 
was betting.

In return, one 
broker received £5,000 every three months in kickbacks, regulators said.
In one email, a broker says: ‘Make 6m [six months] go lower! They r 
going up. [Senior trader]will buy you a Ferrari next year if you move 3m
up and no change 6m’

All 
three ICAP brokers at the centre of the scandal have been fired but 
regulators said at least seven other ICAP staff participated in the 
wrongdoing.

UBS trader Hayes was earlier this year charged with eight counts of conspiracy to defraud by the Serious Fraud Office.

Tracey
McDermott, director of enforcement at the FCA, said: ‘The misconduct in
relation to Libor has cast a shadow over the financial services 
industry.

‘The findings we 
publish today illustrate... individuals within the industry acting with a
cavalier disregard both for regulatory obligations and the interests of
the markets.’

Regulators 
said lax controls by bank bosses enabled the conspiracy to go on for 
years. Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and UBS have already received 
huge fines for manipulating Libor, which is used to set financial 
contracts such as mortgages.
