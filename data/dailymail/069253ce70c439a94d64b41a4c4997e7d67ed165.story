Chelsea target Paul Pogba was spotted in west London on Thursday, just a stone's throw away from Stamford Bridge as he posed for pictures with fans in Knightsbridge.

The French midfielder was one of the stars of the 2014 World Cup and has been linked with a £60million move away from Serie A champions Juventus with Chelsea on the hunt for another central midfielder.

When a fan asked the French youngster if he would be signing for Jose Mourinho's side, Pogba chuckled.

Main man: Pogba enjoyed an impressive World Cup campaign for France

Pogba, who left Manchester United as a 
youngster in 2012, has been attracting interest from the biggest clubs 
across Europe after an impressive season in Italy.

The 21-year-old midfielder was also pictured playing popular computer game Football Manager and 'managing' Chelsea against London rivals Arsenal - and picking himself in midfield alongside outgoing club legend Frank Lampard.

Pogba left Old Trafford at the end of his contract in 2012 after falling out with Sir Alex Ferguson but has since gone on to become one of most sought-after midfielders in Europe.

He has been a key part of Juventus' title-winning midfield this year and started France's opening game against Honduras before coming off the bench in their 5-2 win over Switzerland.

Juve are understood to be willing to sell Pogba despite protestations that he is a key figure at the club.
