This chilling CCTV image shows the haunting moment a pregnant teenager met her ex-boyfriend hours before he strangled her and buried her body in his uncle's grave.

Violent and controlling Ben Blakeley was today found guilty of murdering Jayden Parkinson. He killed the 17-year-old in the countryside on December 3 last year - 24 hours after she had told him she was expecting his child.

After strangling the teenager, Blakeley, 22, buried her body in his uncle’s grave at a cemetery in Didcot, Oxfordshire.

The former binman was obsessive and 
controlling and after their split he had threatened to post intimate 
naked videos and photographs of Jayden on Facebook - hoping that she 
would kill herself as a result.

A jury at Oxford Crown Court today found 
Blakeley guilty of Jayden’s murder following a five-week trial by a 
majority of 11-1 after more then 20 hours of deliberations.

There were gasps of relief from the 17-year-old victim's mother and family members as the foreman delivered the guilty verdict.

Jayden's mother Erica Simms, 47, began sobbing and fled the courtroom in floods of tears. Outside, she shrieked: 'My baby.'

Blakeley, from Reading, Berkshire, had denied murdering Jayden - but had admitted her manslaughter and attempting to pervert the course of justice.

After the verdict Blakeley showed no emotion merely walking to the cells and slamming the door of the dock behind him while Jayden’s family sobbed loudly.

Judge Patrick Eccles QC said Ben Blakeley would be sentenced tomorrow.

Speaking outside court, Detective Superintendent Chris Ward, head of major crime at Thames Valley Police, said: 'Jayden Parkinson's life was taken from her and today somebody was found guilty of her murder.

'I welcome the verdict and that Ben Blakeley has been found guilty. Jayden's family are extremely pleased. This is the start for them to get some closure.' 

He said: 'As far as we know it is the first of its kind. It's extremely unique.
