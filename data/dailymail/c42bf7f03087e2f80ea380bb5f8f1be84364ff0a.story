Three garages in the West Midlands have slashed petrol prices to 99.7p a litre - the lowest its been in five years

Motorists can buy petrol for less than £1 a litre for the first time in five years after three garages in the West Midlands slashed their prices to 99.7p.   

The owner of the independent Harvest Energy stations knocked 6p off the price of his petrol this afternoon after becoming fed up of supermarkets 'cheating' customers with rip-off costs.

More stations are expected to follow suit over the coming days as the price of oil continues to fall.

Dr Velautham Sarveswaran, who runs the three petrol stations in Redditch, Walsall and Birmingham with his wife Ananthi, told MailOnline he felt compelled to lower his prices after tiring of the supermarket fuel pricing 'scandal'.

'I will still be making money by cutting prices and my customers wanted to see me break the £1 barrier. My customers are happy,' he said.

'People travel as far as 20 miles just for my petrol prices. 

'The supermarkets continue to make a fortune without passing the price cuts to their customers. It is a scandal. They are cheating people.'

Dr Sarveswaran bought all three of his garages in 2002 after they had closed down, bringing the failed businesses back from the dead with a strategy of 'consistent low pricing'. 

'The customers have been praising us for the low prices and our customer services and they keep coming back,' he said.

'We respect our customers and were willing to reduce the petrol to 99.7p. Happy customers make us happy and proud. It is a great feeling that we make the customers satisfied.'

The garage owner ran out of petrol three times over Christmas after lowering petrol to £1.05 and diesel to £1.12 a litre.

However, the demand for his fuel is likely to be even higher after his petrol stations became the first to sell fuel for less than a £1 a litre in five years.

Petrol last averaged less than £1 on May 31, 2009, when the price was 99.9p. 

The price of a barrel of Brent crude oil has fallen from $114 l in June to $49.95 on Friday – a drop of 56 per cent.

The Government has demanded that petrol retailers pass on the fall in costs swiftly to consumers and petrol now averages about £1.10 a litre.

The wholesale price of fuel accounts for around 20 to 25 per cent of a litre of fuel at that price, with a further 57.95p in fuel duty, and VAT charged at 20 per cent, added on top. 

Supermarkets and fuel giants such as BP and Shell have reduced the price at the pump for the consumer however none have cut their prices to under a £1 a litre.

On Tuesday Chancellor George Osborne warned airlines and power giants to pass on savings made from plummeting fuel prices to the consumer or face Government sanctions.  

Osborne insisted they should quickly follow the lead of petrol retailers and slash their charges following the fall in the price of oil.

The Chancellor insisted it was ‘vital this was passed on to families at petrol pumps, through utility bills and air fares’.

The first case of swine flu had just been found in Britain, Bonkers by Dizzee Rascal was number one in the charts - and petrol cost less than £1 a litre.

And while it may seem bonkers to believe, especially considering that petrol cost as much as £1.40 a litre not long ago,  May 2009 was the last time, on average, that petrol was sold at that price - until today.

While  today's price cut is at just three stations, it could be a sign of good things to come.

The RAC has warned since November that prices would fall below a £1 as the average cost of oil plumetted.

Spokesman Simon Williams said: 'What’s currently happening at the pumps with falling fuel prices is something many motorists will not remember seeing before. 

'Talk of prices going up like a rocket and falling like a feather could not be further from the truth as retailers have been quick to pass on savings at the forecourt since the RAC forecast on December 6 that prices were due to come down by 7p a litre for petrol and 6p for diesel.'
