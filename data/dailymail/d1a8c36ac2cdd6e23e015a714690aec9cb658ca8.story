They took to the pitch to keep football fans' spirits high while Britain's men were off at war. But there was one team that stood tall above the rest.

Thousands of female munition factory workers began playing the beautiful game during World War One, but the Blyth Spartans Munitionettes from Northumberland played more beautifully than all the others.

Taught to play by naval ratings on a local beach, the Blyth Spartans remained unbeaten throughout their two-year existence.

Star player: The Blyth Spartans top player was coalminer's daughter, Bella Raey

Their star centre-forward was Bella Raey, the daughter of a local coal miner, who scored 133 goals in one season, and even went on to play for England.

The highlight of the female football calendar was a knock-out tournament called the Munitionettes Cup, held in 1918, which attracted 30 teams.

The Blyth Spartans were the eventual winners, beating Bolckow-Vaughan of Middlesbrough at Ayresome Park in front of a crowd of 22,000. Bella Reay scored a hat-trick.

But despite the women being almost as popular on the pitch as the men had been before the war, when the boys returned home, the munition factories closed and the teams disbanded.

Several women tried to continue to play, but in 1921, the FA banned women's football at their grounds - bringing to an end a colourful chapter in women's sport which has long been overlooked.

Now the story of the Blyth Spartans Munitionettes has been brought to life in a radio documentary for BBC Newcastle as part of a new series that explores the tales of the British women who kept the UK moving during World War One.

The UK-wide project, World War One At Home, will tell more than 1400 powerful, fascinating and moving stories over the coming year across local, regional and national radio, television and online.Â
