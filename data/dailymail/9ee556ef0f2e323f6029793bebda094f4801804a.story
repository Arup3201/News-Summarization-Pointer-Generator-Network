California Highway Patrol is investigating whether alcohol played a role in the crash, according to the Associated Press.

The vehicle overturned several times, said CHP Officer Cheyenne Quesada.

Celia managed to crawl out of the 
car and, after noticing a light about 1,000 feet in the distance, she 
walked in nearly pitch-black surroundings through rugged terrain to a 
nearby home, but nobody answered the door, the CHP said.

She then back-tracked to check on her
 father. When she saw he was still unconscious, she told authorities she
 hiked up the steep embankment and along the road to a commuter rail 
station where she flagged down a passing motorist at about 2.30am.

CHP Sgt. Tom Lackey told KABC-TV the girl showed commitment and courage searching for help extremely dangerous conditions.

'She walked quite a distance in a very, very threatening environment. It's very black out there, very dark,' Lackey told the TV station, adding that he'd never seen anything like it in his 28-year career.

'It's very steep and it's brushy and there's also coyotes in the background.'

Responding
 officers arrived to find the 35-year-old from Los Angelese had been killed, Quesada said.

Tragedy: The 2010 Ford Escape, pictured, was launched about 200 feet down the embankment along a semi-rural stretch of the Sierra Highway in Acton, Southern California, about 1 a.m. on Sunday

A helicopter transported Celia to Children's Hospital Los Angeles where she was treated for minor injuries including bumps and bruises and a cut on her face.

According to KABC, the girl told authorities that she and her dad were on their way back home from a party when he started having trouble maneuvering the curvy roads.
