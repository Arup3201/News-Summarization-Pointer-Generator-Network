A Seattle Seahawks player has potentially left his team open to a $50,000 fine after storming out of the NFL's media day events well before the required 45 minutes were up.

Running back Marshawn Lynch made an early exit from the Super Bowl event held today in Newark, New Jersey.

The Seattle and Denver players were expected to speak to media members during the 45-minute sessions that lead up to the game, but Lynch only stayed for a few minutes before leaving.

Clamming up: Marshawn Lynch, a running back for the Seattle Seahawks, spoke to very few reporters and stormed out of the media day ahead of the Super Bowl

Not wanting to be there: When he did return minutes later, Lynch spoke to only a select few members of the media and kept away from the hoards of others

He later came back and stood on the side of the media area, doing interviews with the Armed Forces Network, Deion Sanders for the NFL Network and a Seahawks Web reporter.

Lynch also talked to teammates and signed footballs and a helmet for fans in the stands.

While he did that, about five dozen media members stood in front of Lynch and shouted out questions.

He ignored almost all of them as time ran out in Seattle's 45-minute availability.

One reporter asked, 'Are you trying to avoid being fined by standing here?' Lynch twice nodded his head yes.Â 

Part of the deal: Members of each playoff team are meant to be available for 45 minutes of interviews on media day, as Lynch's teammates are seen here

Facing the press: Even Richard Sherman, who became the subject of much criticism following his on-field post game interview, participated fully in the media day events

Lynch watched as the clocked counted down to zero and, when it was announced the Seattle portion was over, left for good.

Earlier this month, Lynch was fined $50,000 for not cooperating with the Seattle media.

The NFL put the fine on hold, saying it would be rescinded if his behavior improved.

'Players are required to participate and he participated. We will continue to monitor the situation,' NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said Tuesday.

Lynch has required media sessions Wednesday and Thursday. The Seahawks play the Denver Broncos on Sunday.

At media day, Lynch was standing on the floor of the covered-over hockey rink among a cluster of about 100 reporters.

There were eight podiums set up for Seattle stars and coach Pete Carroll, plus nine other separated areas separated from the throng. Lynch wasn't positioned at any of them.
