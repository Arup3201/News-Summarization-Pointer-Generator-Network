The Obama administration is
considering imposing a forced quarantine on healthcare workers who return to the
United States from the Ebola hot zone of West Africa, after a
New York doctor who treated patients there tested positive
for the virus on Thursday.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesman Tom Skinner told Reuters on Friday that a mandatory quarantine is one possible plan under discussion by officials from
across the administration.

'There are a number of options being discussed pertaining to
the monitoring and mobility of healthcare workers who are
returning to the United States from affected countries,' Skinner
said.

Jeff Hulbert of Annapolis, Maryland, held up a sign in front of the White House on Friday; he wants a mandatory quarantine for all people – not just doctors – who have returned to the US from Ebola-ravaged countries

'We want to strike the right balance of doing what is best
to protect the public's health while not impeding whatsoever our
ability to combat the epidemic in West Africa. Our risk here
will not be zero until we stop the epidemic there.'

As for a possible quarantine, 'that's one of the options on the table,' Skinner said.

The CDC-led discussions began on Thursday after Dr. Craig
Spencer in New York became the fourth person diagnosed with the
disease in the United States.

Skinner said discussions are likely to produce some change
in current policy and that the aim is to reach a decision as
soon as possible.

The Spencer case has heightened public anxiety about the
virus and the Obama administration's response to its arrival on
U.S. soil.

Last month, Liberian national Thomas Eric Duncan became the
first case diagnosed in the United States after arriving in
Dallas from his home country. He died on Oct. 8.

Two nurses who helped treat him came down with Ebola,
stirring fear about infection dangers and uncertainty about U.S.
preparedness for dealing with the virus.

Current policy calls for returning healthcare workers and
military personnel to be monitored for Ebola symptoms during the
virus's maximum 21-day incubation period. 

But lawmakers have
expressed concern that those being monitored are also able to
resume normal routines, potentially placing members of the
public at risk for infection.

Deborah Burger, co-president of National Nurses United, testified Friday on Capitol Hill and begged the government to implement stricter controls so more nurses don't contract the deadly contagion

'Whatever option we come up with just simply can't hamper
ability to respond to the situation in West Africa,' Skinner
said. 'Because as long as that's going on over there, our risk
will never be zero.'

The United States is undertaking a major effort to contain
the worst outbreak of Ebola since the disease was identified in
1976. At least 4,877 people have died of the disease,
predominantly in the impoverished West African countries of
Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.

The U.S. response includes sending up to 4,000 troops as
well as doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers to West
Africa.

On Friday, Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives
took issue with a Pentagon policy that subjects troops to only
10 days of monitoring before they return home from the region. 

Pentagon officials told lawmakers that troops would still face
21 days of monitoring under current CDC guidelines once home
while resuming their normal daily routines.
