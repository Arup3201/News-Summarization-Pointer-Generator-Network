An alternative therapist sacked only three weeks into a new job has been awarded £25,000 after accusing her boss of being a ‘sex pest’.

Samantha Allen, who specialises in massages, aromatherapy and meditation, claimed Christopher  Barral looked down her top as she cleaned the office fish tank.

The 26-year-old mother of one also alleged that he made her massage him while he was wearing only boxer shorts and asked if she had ever treated anyone naked.

Victory: Samantha Allen was awarded £25,000 after she won her case of sexual discrimination against former boss Christopher Borral

And she claimed that on her first day at the home care firm run by the  married 42-year-old, Barral asked her whether she thought brothels reduced the number of rapes.

Only 19 days after she was taken on, he fired Miss Allen for not meeting his ‘expectations’, a tribunal was told.

Although she was awarded £24,655 after winning a claim of sexual discrimination and harassment against him, Miss Allen may never see the money because Barral has since shut the firm down. He failed to attend  the damages hearing, instead providing a one-line statement denying discriminating against her.

Yesterday Miss Allen branded Barral ‘devious and sleazy’ and told how her time at the firm had left her feeling violated. She also said she can no longer face taking on male clients.

‘He fired me because he realised I would not give in and he could not get what he wanted from me,’ she said. ‘He wanted something more. I believe he wanted sex from me. He is horrible, manipulative, smarmy, devious and sleazy.’

Miss Allen, from Crewe, was hired by Abacus Care (Cheshire), in September last year to provide home visits to vulnerable adults.

She told Manchester Employment Tribunal that on her first day Barral  told her he thought brothels were good for the economy and reduced the number of rapes.  Judge David Franey concluded: ‘[Barral] would not have behaved in the same way with a male employee.’

Barral, of High Legh, Cheshire, said in a statement: ‘At no point did I sexually discriminate against the employee Samantha Allen while employed by Abacus Care (Cheshire) Ltd.’

The firm was a franchise of Abacus Care which last night said it had ended its commercial relationship with Mr Barral 'some time ago' following 'breaches of operating agreements'.

'Abacus Care has absolutely no involvement with the case,' Managing Director Nigel Fielding said.
