A middle-aged Westerner is among six victims wounded in a knife attack at a Chinese train station today, according to witnesses.

Two women and three men, including a European man his 50s, were said to be among those injured by assailants wielding foot-and-a-half-long knives at Guangzhou Railway Station in Guangdong province.

Armed officers shot and wounded one of the attackers, said Guangzhou police. Local media reported that a second suspect was captured fleeing the scene.

Officials are blaming the attack on 'terrorists' from Xinjiang, a mainly Muslim western province in the grip of a separatist insurgency. Police later denied a Westerner had been involved in the attack, despite the witnesses' reports.

A group of men sat on steps outside the station for two hours this morning before, at 11 o'clock, they let out a shout, pulled 20in knives from their bags and began attacking people, said a shopkeeper who witnessed it.

He told the Guangzhou Daily that police were on the scene within a minute and began shooting.

Guangzhou police said its officers 'arrived quickly on the scene' and shot one of the attackers. The official Nanfang Daily said another suspect had been caught by police after fleeing the scene.

'After verbal warnings were ineffective, police fired, hitting one male suspect holding a knife, and subdued him,' Guangzhou police said on an official microblog.

Provincial television showed pictures of what it said was an apparently injured suspect being pressed to the ground by police and plain-clothed security, as they removed a bloodied white t-shirt.

It was not possible to see the man's face.

knives, wore white clothes, including white hats, and launched their 
assault as passengers were leaving the station.

 witnesses told the South China Morning Post that a Westerner was among 
those the assailants targeted in the blood-soaked rampage.

 afternoon armed police had cordoned off the empty plaza outside 
Guangzhou station while street cleaners mopped pools of blood from the 
flagstones.

Victims were earlier seen being loaded into an ambulance.

Armed police stand guard outside Guangzhou station: Nervousness about Islamic militancy has grown in China after a string of lethal attacks which officials have blamed on separatist insurgents from Xinjiang

Nervousness about Islamic militancy has grown since a car exploded on the edge of Beijing's Tiananmen Square in October and 29 people were stabbed to death in March in the southwestern city of Kunming.

The government blamed militants from Xinjiang for both those attacks and a more recent bomb and knife attack at a train station in Urumqi, Xinjiang's capital, that killed one and wounded 79 last Wednesday.

Resource-rich and strategically located, the province on the borders of central Asia has for years been beset by violence blamed by the Chinese government on Islamist militants.

Exiles and many rights groups say the real cause of the unrest in Xinjiang is China's heavy-handed policies, including curbs on Islam and the culture and language of the Muslim Uighur people.
