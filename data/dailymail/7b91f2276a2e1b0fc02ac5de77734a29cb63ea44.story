It's smooth sailing so far for newlyweds Cheryl Hines and Robert F Kennedy Jr, who were pictured today taking a boat trip with friends the day after their rainy wedding in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts.

Cheryl, the actress best known for her role on TV show Curb Your Enthusiasm, was photographed talking on the phone while her new husband Bobby, the son of assassinated senator Robert F Kennedy, followed down to the dock.

Bobby's sister Kerry smiled as a photographer snapped her bringing a bucket of KFC fried chicken onto the boat for the excursion. 

The actor Ed Begley Jr and his wife Rachelle Carson also came along for the ride, along with fellow actor Kevin Nealon.

Cheryl and Bobby tied the knot yesterday in a ceremony attended by about 300 including both the Kennedy clan and Hollywood elite.

Their nuptials were unfortunately delayed by a summer rain storm, and plans to exchange vows on the beach were changed last minute to take place in a tent on the Kennedy compound. 

The bride wore a strapless white cocktail-length dress by Romana Keveza and carried a bouquet with both blue and white flowers.

Those pictured arriving at the event include Joan Kennedy, ex-wife of the late Senator Ted Kennedy, Bobby's mother Ethel Kennedy, Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey, the actress Julia Louis Dreyfus and her husband Brad Hall and Cheryl's Curb Your Enthusiasm co-star and creator Larry David.

David was allegedly asked to give a toast at the reception, but awkwardly declined with 'lots of no's and hand movements'.

Musicians Natasha Beningfield and Lyle Lovett reportedly played at the reception, where workers were asked to sign confidentiality agreements.

The rainy Saturday afternoon nuptials happened despite rampant rumors of Bobby's infidelity.

The wedding comes just weeks after MailOnline told how it was alleged that Bobby had a two-year affair with Connecticut socialite Chelsea Kirwan.

This is the third marriage for Bobby, the son of the late senator Robert F. Kennedy and the nephew of President John F. Kennedy and the late Senator Edward Kennedy.

The 60-year-old activist and his 48-year-old bride, best known for playing Larry David's wife on HBO hit Curb Your Enthusiasm and ABC comedy Suburgatory, have recently had an offer accepted on a $5million Malibu property - meaning Bobby may make the move to the West Coast.

This is believed to be Bobby's way of showing his commitment to Cheryl following claims that he had cheated on her as he had on his previous wife.

Bobby could still be drawn into Chelsea Kirwan's bitter divorce from surgeon to the stars Laurence Kirwan as the mother-of-four faces a deposition and will likely be asked about her relationship with the Kennedy scion.

On Monday, Kennedy and Hines were spotted at the John F. Kennedy Museum gift shop in Hyannis to buy gifts for the bridal party.

And they have reserved a block of rooms at the Hyannis Harbor hotel for their guests. The hotel is a 500-room venue that lies on the ocean -and is booked out over this weekend.

Bobby has previously been married to Ruth Black, the mother of his children Robert Kennedy III and Kathleen (known as Kick), from 1984 to 1994 and then Mary Richardson, between 1994 and 2012.

Mary, with whom Bobby had children Conor, Kyra, William and Aiden, committed suicide at her Bedford, New York, home in May 2012. She was 52.

In May 2010, Bobby filed for divorce from Mary after 16 years of marriage. Details of their divorce filing were kept private.

The New York Post has revealed that the environmental lawyer and activist, who works for Pace University and Riverkeeper, had contact details for 43 suspected mistresses stored in his cell phone

It was reported he kept a list of dozens of women filed under the letter 'G' in his cell phone, including both Cheryl Hines and Chelsea Kirwan.

 downtown Hyannis Saturday afternoon during the rain. Pictured here are

Actor Ed Begley Jr, a close friend of Kennedy's was spotted getting onto a shuttle in the rain

She is understood to have believed he had stored the names under 'G' because of the Italian slang for mistress - 'goomah'.

This isn't the first time that details about RFK Jr's alleged philandering has emerged. A 2001 diary belonging to him surfaced last September which helped gave a stunning insight into the number of affairs he had carried out during the same year that wife Mary had given birth to their fourth child.

Bobby used a section at the back of his diary, headed 'cash accounts,' to list the first names of women he had cavorted with and gave each a mark out of ten.

The list contains the names of 37 women, 16 of whom have the number ten beside them - which is believed to have signified that they had full intercourse.

Time and again he wrote of how he felt tortured by his 'lust demons' as he described them.

On days when he didn't cheat, Bobby wrote 'victory' to signify that he had resisted sexual temptation.

'I'm like Adam and live in Eden, and I can have everything but the fruit. But the fruit is all I want,' he wrote on Nov. 5, 2001.

The thick, red journal was found at one stage by his wife, Mary Richardson Kennedy and later found its way into the hands of the New York Post. When a Post reporter questioned Kennedy about the diary they were first met with a stunned silence before he denied having kept a diary during that year.

'I don't think there is any way you could have a diary or journal of mine from 2001,' said Kennedy. 'I don't have any comment on it. I have no diary from 2001.'

 area around the Kennedy compound was guarded by local police and
