Huddled together wearing life jackets, these are the first pictures showing passengers on board a huge Caribbean cruise liner preparing for an emergency evacuation.

While some laugh and joke, others - including the elderly and children - look out to the pitch black sea anxiously, no doubt fearing for their safety.

Passengers on board Royal Caribbean’s 
Grandeur of the Seas said they heard 'big explosions' after a fire broke
out in the stern [rear] of the ship in the early hours of Monday 
morning.

British holidaymakers were among more than 2,200 guests evacuated from the huge cruise liner.

Scary: Passengers aboard the Royal Caribbean's Grandeur of the Seas cruise ship gather in life-jackets after a fire broke out during the ship's voyage from Baltimore to the Bahamas

Worrying: British holidaymakers were among more than 2,200 guests evacuated from a huge cruise liner

Passengers report that amid the chaos life preservers were distributed to several people as they waited in safety areas

British passenger Mark Ormesher 
described how he and his girlfriend were roused by a crew member, and 
told to grab floatation devices.

It wasn’t a drill, the crewman added, as the pair emerged into a corridor smelling of acrid smoke.

According to Mr Ormesher, who lives 
in Virginia, the fire damage at the stern of the ship was severe and 
startling passengers' pictures posted on social network websites bore 
that out.

Mr Ormesher, 25, and on his first cruise, 
said the air conditioner had been shut off, and as the hours passed and 
the ship got hot, bottled water was passed around.

As passengers waited in assembly 
stations for more than four hours, some panicked as a warning horn 
blared over the tannoy system.

'The frightening part was when they 
started lowering the lifeboats. A lot of people were passing out with 
fear,' said Bang Warren, from Baltimore.

Frightening: Royal Caribbean said the fire occurred early Monday and was extinguished after about two hours with no injuries reported. Passengers can be seen looking out to see during the incident

The fire broke out on deck 3 and was quickly extinguished but the damage caused Royal Caribbean to cancel the cruise bound for the Bahamas

Ms Warren described the chaotic scene  to The Baltimore Sun.

'The crew was running up and down the deck with oxygen. I know some children were vomiting.'

However, the liner made it safely to Freeport in the Bahamas, from where passengers were flown home.

The ship had left Baltimore last Friday for a seven-night cruise.

Royal Caribbean, which has yet to 
find the cause of the fire, said it took two hours to put out after it 
broke out in an area used to store ship mooring lines.

Damage: The blaze wiped out the stern of the Grandeur of the Seas as well as a bar and the resturant

All 2,224 guests and 796 were safely accounted for, said the company.

The  passengers will now fly back to Maryland on 11 flights chartered by the cruise line.

Startling photos of the ship emerged 
on social networking sites showing the entire stern of the vessel charred and 
destroyed, as passengers recounted their terrifying experiences.

'I heard these big explosions and saw the fire jump out of the ship,' passenger Dan McTigue told ABC News. 'We couldn't get to the muster station because it was on fire.'

'I started crying,' his granddaughter Sophia said. 'I thought we were gonna die.'

No cause for the fire has been revealed, and authorities continue to investigate. A bar and a restaurant were also destroyed by the flames, which reached four decks.

Royal Caribbean said that the blaze began at 2.50am and was extinguished about two hours later with no injuries reported.

Royal Caribbean announced that the 2,224 passengers would be receiving a full refund and a gift certificate from the company.

Another passenger, Danielle Miller, 
23, said that she was sound asleep and was unaware of anything untoward 
until the ship's intercom asked passengers to put life jackets on.

'My first thought was that we were sinking,' said Danielle of her terror.

The ship was forced to dock in Freeport, Grand Bahama island as the fire damage was assessed

According to several passenger accounts nobody was seriously injured but the fire did cause smoke and flooding

'I
opened the door and just see people running around with life jackets on
and we were being yelled at to get our life jackets on and run up to a 
deck that was two floors above us,' she told ABC News.

'But
we didn't know what was going on because when we were going to bed it 
was really stormy, so we honestly thought the boat might have been 
sinking. And we were just panicking and running upstairs.

'And we didn't know for about a half hour that there was a fire two decks below where we were at.'

Miller revealed she was so nervous as the fire raged that her hands were shaking and her heart was pounding.

'A couple people fainted. People were throwing up, crying. Just anxiety attacks everywhere. I was just telling my roommate stay calm,' she said.

Fiery Call: The fire that began at 2:50 a.m. Monday was extinguished about two hours later with no injuries reported

Royal Caribbean said that two guests 
were treated after fainting, and medical staff responded to reports of 
high blood pressure and an ankle sprain.

Nathan Pletscher spoke to ABC News to
explain how he became nervous for his parents aboard the ship only 
after he looked at a photo tweeted by Royal Caribbean's public relations
team.

'We originally saw a news article and
were a little nervous. When we made contact with my parents, they said 
there was a small fire,' he said.

'When I saw the photo on Twitter, I said, "That 
was a little more than a small fire." It's really fortunate the crew was
able to get fire under control and things of that nature.'

Speaking to the news network, 
Pletscher admitted that his parents had a 'sense of panic' and had 
become 'obviously nervous', but were calmed by the ships crew.

'When the alarm first went off, there
was an 'uh-oh' moment,' Pletscher said. 'But they couldn't say enough 
about how organized and professional both the captain and crew were. 
They kept everyone calm and were extremely transparent on with the whole
situation.'

Royal Caribbean has said they are in the process of arranging flights for the 2,224 guests currently aboard the ship

The company in a statement on its website said it is 'deeply sorry for this unexpected development in our guests' vacation. We understand that this may have been a very stressful time for them'

Royal Caribbean said all 2,224 guests and 796 crew were safe and accounted for

Firefighter Brian Goss, a passenger on the ship, told WOOD-TV that some of the cabins experienced flooding and that the hallways smelled of smoke for most of the morning.

But
he praised the efforts of the company, and said they were working 
tirelessly on the situation: 'Up all night in emergency mode and now 
serving food and drinks with smiling faces and no sleep.'

The crew and passengers remained calm, and helped those who needed it. Crying babies were given formula and held while their parents used the bathrooms.

After passengers 
were allowed to leave their stations, Ormesher said he saw water on the 
outside of deck 5 and in the hallways. The mooring lines were destroyed 
he said; crew members brought new lines from storage.

In Freeport, passenger Andrea Sanders
of Washington, D.C., said she slept on the deck with hundreds of other 
passengers as smoke billowed out of the stern of the ship. 'I was 
terrified with it being my first cruise,' Sanders told The Freeport News
as she ate lunch in port.

A tweet sent from the NTSB shows they are investigating the situation

The Twitter account for their public 
relations department announced they were in the process of scheduling 
passengers on flights to Baltimore.

A spokesman 
for Royal Caribbean said: 'Royal Caribbean International is deeply sorry
for this unexpected development in our guests' vacation.

'We
understand that this may have been a very stressful time for them. And 
we also know that it has significantly impacted their vacation 
experience. We appreciate their patience and cooperation in dealing with
this unfortunate situation.'

Royal Caribbean said in a statement 
on its website that most public areas and staterooms are safe and power,
propulsion and communications systems functioned without interruption.

Royal Caribbean International president and CEO Adam Goldstein met with passengers in Freeport.

The National Transportation Safety Board said in a tweet that it will join the U.S. Coast Guard in investigating the fire.

Carnival Corp. also had trouble with fire aboard ship earlier this year.

The
900-foot Triumph was disabled during a February cruise by an engine 
room fire in the Gulf of Mexico, leaving thousands of passengers to 
endure cold food, unsanitary conditions and power outages while the ship
was towed to Mobile, Alabama.

It remained there for repairs until early May when it headed back to sea under its own power.
