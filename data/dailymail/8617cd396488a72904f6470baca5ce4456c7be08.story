Nemanja Vidic has been one of Europe's finest centre-back's for many years but he has endured a torrid start to his life in Italy at Inter Milan.

The Serb followed Rio Ferdinand and Patrice Evra out of the Manchester United exit door this summer - with the trio forming the bedrock of the club's trophy laden defence.

Replacing Vidic and Ferdinand has been a problem for the Red Devils, most evidently in their 5-3 Premier League defeat at Leicester earlier this month, but it seems a change has not been particularly good for the centre-back duo, either.

Upon signing a three-year contract at Inter,  Vidic stated that Italian football suited his game well

Appearances - 300

Goals - 28

5x Premier League (2006-07, 2007-08, 2008-09, 2010-11, 2012-13)

1x Champions League - (2007-8)

3x League Cup (2005-06, 2008-09, 2009-10)

1x FIFA Club World Cup - (2008)

5x Community Shield (2007-08, 2008-09, 2010-11, 2011-12, 2013-14) 

The pair have shipped in a combined total of 18 league goals in the 10 matches they have played since they departed Old Trafford.

While Ferdinand's struggles at QPR have been well documented in England, it's perhaps Vidic's shaky start at Inter that is the most surprising.

At his unveiling at the San Siro he said: 'I don't think this is a step backwards in my career, I believe this is a step forward for me.

'Italian football suits my game well and, as I said before, I have joined one of the big European clubs.' 

The 32-year-old signed a three-year deal and was expected by many to help the club close last season's 42-point gap to Serie A champions Juventus.

Vidic, however, endured a nightmare debut at Torino, conceding a penalty in the first half before being sent off with seconds remaining in the clash for sarcastically applauding the referee.

The defender served a one-match ban and missed his side's emphatic 7-0 win against Sassuolo in the next match.

Returning from suspension, Vidic was immediately recalled to the starting line-up in their 1-1 draw at Palermo by boss Walter Mazzarri.

Mazzarri's decision backfired three minutes into the clash, when the Serb's dawdling saw him dispossessed by Franco Vazquez, who scored past Samir Handonovic from a tight angle to put the hosts ahead.

The former United captain looked more like his commanding self in the Nerazzurri's 2-0 win against Atalanta on Wednesday, but at home to Cagliari on Sunday he was found badly wanting.

Vidic suffered his first defeat as an Inter player where they were thrashed 4-1 by the Rossoblu - who were bottom of the table until that result.

Even worse, the defender gave away his second penalty in four Serie A games, this time hauling down Marco Sau inside his own box.

Andrea Cossu’s effort was saved by Handanovic but Inter’s defence fell apart as Albin Ekdal’s hat-trick condemned them to defeat.

Off the pitch, too, Vidic's acclimatisation to Italy hasn't got off to the smoothest of starts after he was caught stuck in a lift for two hours on a public holiday before engineers arrived to free him.

His poor displays have been mirrored by Ferdinand following his free transfer to Loftus Road.

In his six matches at the Premier League new boys, the 35-year-old has been part of a defence that has conceded 13 goals - with Harry Redknapp's side winning just one of their opening matches so far.

Ferdinand was at fault for QPR's opening day 1-0 home defeat by Hull, allowing Tigers' matchwinner James Chester to score from a corner - an error that was heavily criticised by Match of the Day pundit Alan Shearer.

Ferdinand was beaten in the air by Peter Crouch (both centre) for Stoke's opening goal against QPR

In their 2-2 draw against Stoke earlier this month, the former England captain endured a torrid afternoon against Peter Crouch.

Vying for the ball in the early stages of the match, Crouch embarrassingly outpaced Ferdinand - an asset that defender was once renowned for.

Crouch soon tormented Ferdinand once more - beating him in the air to allow team-mate Mame Biram Diouf to score.

Both Ferdinand and Vidic were wonderful at United but suddenly, maybe the decision to let them leave Old Trafford does not look too bad.
