Paul Pogba will leave Juventus within 18 months and could even be sold in the summer.

The France international is being courted by a host of top clubs across Europe.

Manchester United, who somewhat controversially allowed Pogba to leave on a free transfer in the summer of 2012, are interested in bringing the 21-year-old back to Old Trafford. Chelsea are also keen, while Barcelona have expressed their interest.

But Pogba’s agent has warned that the midfielder will only be available for a fee in excess of £80million.

'If Paul leaves Juventus, it is for the absolute top. If it does not happen this year, it will be next year,' said Mino Raiola, who also looks after Mario Balotelli and Zlatan Ibrahimovic.

'Paul is at the same level economically as the other big stars and has a similar reputation, so he could stay for another year.

‘But Paul is the only major star who is available at the end of the season. If you cannot take Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi or Zlatan Ibrahimovic, you can only go for Paul.

'If someone wants him, the market situation could see him go for more than €100m.'

Pogba joined Juventus after Sir Alex Ferguson refused to match his wage demands three years ago.

The France international opted to join Juventus instead of their Serie A rivals AC Milan. Raiola also claimed Inter Milan did not want to ‘create a row’ with the then United boss Sir Alex Ferguson.

‘Do you know why I told him to sign for Juventus? Milan wanted to sign him together with Genoa and then send him there on loan,’ Raiola told La Gazzetta dello Sport.

‘Inter then said they did not want to create a row with [ex-Manchester United boss] Alex Ferguson.

‘With Juventus the deal was quite simple. They signed him, gave him the wages of a first-team player and did not send him out on loan.’
