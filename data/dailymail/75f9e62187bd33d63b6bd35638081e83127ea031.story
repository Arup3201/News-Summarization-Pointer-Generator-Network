Lena Dunham's hit HBO series Girls is reimagined in the vein of Transformers director Michael Bay's action-packed blockbusters, which often feature bikini-clad women and massive explosions, in a new spoof video that takes aim the hyper-sexualization of women in Hollywood. 

The parody trailer for Hot Girls was directed by Alberto Belli and written by actresses Polina Frantsena and Stephanie Lynn, who used quotes and scenes from the feminist series and altered them to spoof the portrayal of women in movies and on television. 

'We wanted to satire Hollywood sexism, so we took the most feminist show we could think of and Michael Bay-ified it,' Stephanie told The Hollywood Reporter.

Making a statement: The spoof features 'hot' versions the characters from Girls, including Hannah, Jessa, Shoshanna and Marnie, and shows them jumping into pools in bikinis and being sexy at all times 

The footage begins with Polina, who plays 'Hot Hannah' in the spoof, reassuring herself that because she is from New York, she is 'naturally interesting' - while she leans seductively on a motorcycle wearing tiny denim shorts. 

The 'ultimate challenge' the show's four characters have to face is running in their high-heels to catch their Uber car that had arrived. 

Actor Brian Krause, who starred on the show Charmed, plays Hannah's boss in the clip.

When Polina's character tells him that she 'can no longer work for free' he responds by noting: 'If you get hungry enough you will figure it out - but not literally. Do not put on any weight. You look great.' 

Shower scene: In the video, 'Hot Hannah' takes a sultry bath with her friend as she checks her text messages 

Special effects: When Shoshanna attacks Marnie, she grows a Transformers-like tail 

Hannah's boyfriend also berates her because of what she is wearing to the office. 

'You can't wear that to work. You've got to dress sexier,' he yells.

Hannah also makes out with her friends in the bathtub in the spoof version of Girls. She and her friends happily dance in skimpy lingerie and climb seductively out of pools in tiny bikinis, while explosives go off in the background.

When 'Hot Marnie' explains to 'Hot Shoshanna' that she slept with 'Hot Ray', Shoshanna leaps on top of her and grows a Transformers-like tail.

Parody plot: The girls 'ultimate challenge' is to run and meet their Uber driver 

Role model: Hannah can be seen cutting a tiny bit of her hair off because she wants to look more like Kate Upton 

New version: The clip also shows Hannah seductively riding a motorcycle 

One scene in the HBO series, shows Lena's character giving herself an impromptu haircut inspired by actress Carey Mulligan.

In the parody version, Hannah barely takes a centimeter off of her luscious blonde locks as she attempts to look more like model Kate Upton. 

At one point in the clip, Hannah cries that she has been '1.3lbs overweight' her entire life.

'It's been awful for me,' she yells. 

The trailer ends with a booming voice announcing: 'Four girls are the only hope left for the voice of our generation.'

Sexy satire: In this version of girls, Hannah wears lingerie and eats a lollipop when she writes in her bed
