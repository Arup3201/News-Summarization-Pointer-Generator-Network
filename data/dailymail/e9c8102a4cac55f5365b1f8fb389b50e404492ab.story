Suspended Miami Dolphins linesman 
Richie Incognito was acting under orders from his coaches' to ‘toughen 
up’ Jonathan Martin when he subjected his teammate to a torrent of 
abusive voice mail and texts messages, claim sources close to the camp.

It
has been revealed that after Martin missed two days of organized team 
activities (OTAs) last spring, coaches encouraged Incognito, the 
offensive line's undisputed leader, to ‘get [Martin] into the fold.’

Just
days later Incognito left a threatening, and racially offensive voice 
mail in which he called Martin, who is bi-racial, a ‘half n*****,’ 
threatened to slap his mother across the face and uttered the words 
‘I'll kill you.’

Incognito, told a local TV reporter that he was 'just trying to weather the storm right now' as reports have emerged that he may have been under orders to 'toughen up' Jonathan Martin

OTA workouts are voluntary, but NFL coaches typically put heavy pressure on players to attend.

Several
sources within the club have admitted to the Sun Sentinel that they now
believe that Incognito went too far with the instructions given to him 
by unnamed members of the coaching staff.

It
is not clear whether the instructions came from head coach Joe Philbin,
offensive line coach Jim Turner, or other assistants, but whoever gave 
Incognito that order could soon be facing disciplinary action too.

The
Dolphins suspended Incognito late Sunday for misconduct related to the 
alleged harassment of Martin, who abruptly left the team a week ago to 
receive help for emotional issues.

On Tuesday, Gus Martin,
the father of Jonathan Martin, told Fox News his son was ‘doing fine’ 
and said the younger Martin wants to speak out and address the 
controversy. However, the elder Martin offered no timetable for when or 
where that would happen.

Incognito, 30, told WSVN on Tuesday that 
he was ‘just trying to weather the storm right now. This will pass.’ He 
did not respond to questions about his status with the Dolphins.

Multiple reports indicate that he will lose his job over the charges and never play for the Dolphins again, his cause wasn't helped after video footage emerged of him using the N-word during a profane tirade at a bar.

The
footage, taken by fans, comes just says after the 30-year-old player 
was suspended by the Miami Dolphins over allegations that he launched a 
racist tirade against young teammate Jonathan Martin and bullied him.

Rant: An obscenity-laced video of Richie Incognito has emerged in which he uses the N-word when greeting a teammate

The video, obtained by TMZ, shows a shirtless Incognito bounding around a bar yelling excitedly.

At one point he shouts at teammate and fellow offensive lineman Mike Pouncey: 'Mike Pouncey, n***a!'

He parades around the bar and shouts again: 'Mike Pouncey, motherf*****!'

Pouncey, who is black, can be seen laughing as he watches his teammate.

TMZ says the footage was shot at a team outing in Miami earlier this year.

CBS Sports reports that Incognito sent Martin, 24, a series of harassing and threatening text messages, including one that referred to him as a ‘half-n*****.’ Martin is biracial.

In the messages Incognito also threatens to defecate in Martin's mouth and promises to track down his family and harm them.

The Miami Herald reports that Incognito will be fired for 'conduct detrimental to the team.' He is on the last year of a three-year, $13million contract.

The NFL is conducting an in-depth investigation into the allegations made by Martin, which include bullying, hazing and taunting by nearly the entire team. 

The Stanford-education Martin took a leave from the team last year to undergo counseling.

Over the weekend it was alleged that almost all the veteran Dolphins players have forced newer recruits to fund their lavish lifestyles 
including $30,000 dinners.

According to reports on ESPN and in the Miami Herald on Sunday, the alleged bank-rolling is partly the reason for Martin's shock leave of absence from the team.

ESPN
claims Incognito got Martin to contribute $15,000 to 
help finance a trip to Vegas last summer, even though he didn't attend. 
However, Incognito quickly disputed the report on Twitter.

ESPN's Chris Mortensen and Adam Schefter released a report regarding Incognito on ESPN.com, saying that several sources insisted Incognito was involved.

They said the incident was not isolated and extended to 2012, when Martin was a second-round draft pick by the team.

One source said any emotional issues Martin is experiencing are directly related to his harassment.

Reporter Adam Schefter tweeted on Monday some of Incognito's alleged messages to Martin

On
Friday, Dolphins coach Joe Philbin said, 'This is something we take 
very seriously and will not be tolerated'.

Incognito has been playing with the 
Dolphins since 2010 and has been in the NFL since 2006, originally with 
the St. Louis Rams. He was selected to the Pro Bowl just last season as 
an offensive guard.

Meanwhile, the Herald reported that one unnamed young player had coughed up so much cash to veterans that he's gone broke.

Reporter
Adam Beasley tweeted: 'Recently, a younger player was handed the tab 
for a $30,000 team dinner. The rookie minimum this year is around 
$400.000.'

Two tweets from Jared Odrick and Will Davis support the accusation.

'Everything tastes better when 
rookies pay for it,' Odrick tweeted on November 2, while Davis wrote 'I 
just seen a dinner bill for $30,000... WOW #RookieNight.'
