A damning dossier has shown how bungling officials failed to capture Jaycee Lee Dugard’s abductors while she was in captivity for almost 20 years.

Phillip Garrido, who raped the girl and fathered two children with her, was jailed for 431 years while his wife Nancy Garrido was sentenced to 36 years in prison for the abduction of Jaycee in 1991.

But it took authorities almost 20 years to rescue her after she was abducted in South Lake Tahoe, California, and a report from El Dorado County prosecutors shows the incredible mistakes made.

Innocence removed: Jaycee Lee Dugard was captured aged 11 in California and held for 18 years

It labels one federal parole agent ‘utterly incompetent’ and looks at how various signs showed Phillip Garrido should have been locked up again in jail while on parole after an earlier rape and kidnap:

One of the most disturbing revelations comes in the videos released, showing one of the 20 times when young girls were lured into the back of his van while his wife got them to stretch and bend over.

El Dorado District Attorney Vern 
Pierson released the videos with a 162-page report on Tuesday. ‘Law 
enforcement failed to see Phillip Garrido for what and who he truly is -
evil,’ he said.

One video 
from 1993 shows Nancy Garrido luring a young girl into the van and 
asking her to do the splits. It begins with the criminal asking the 
girl: ‘That's it. Can you go all the way down?’

The girl says she can go down further - and Nancy Garrido encourages her, saying: ‘Let me see, I bet you can go down really easy’. But the girl notices a light on a camera that is filming her.

Nancy Garrido replies that she does not 
know anything about the camera.

In one interrogation video, she told a 
detective she made 10 to 20 of these videos for her husband.

Phillip Garrido was sentenced to 431 
years to life in prison earlier this year and Nancy Garrido was 
sentenced to 36 years to life.

Jaycee was abducted aged 11 and held 
until she was 29.

Jaycee 
was reunited with her family in August 2009 after her whereabouts were 
discovered during a meeting with a parole agent who had summoned Phillip
Garrido to his office.

The
meeting came after two University of California, Berkeley, police 
employees grew suspicious when Phillip Garrido showed up at the campus 
with the two girls he fathered with Jaycee.

The report also looks at when Phillip
Garrido visited victim Katie Callaway-Hall, following his early release
from a 50-year sentence for her rape and kidnap in 1976, reported the 
Sacramento Bee.

He 
approached her at a casino where she worked in 1988 and it was a 
‘colossal blunder’ for agents not to take the woman’s complaint about 
the incident seriously, the report said.

‘The
criminal justice system failed Jaycee Lee Dugard, it failed Katie 
Callaway-Hall, and assuredly failed many of the other countless unknown 
victims of Phillip Garrido,’ the report said.

Mr Pierson wrote: ‘The failure and 
inadequacies of the psychiatric profession were highlighted by Phillip 
Garrido and his manipulation of them to his advantage.'

Crime scene: The home of Phillip Garrido, where he held Dugard for 18 years, is seen in Antioch, California

After David Garrido captured Dugard in 1991, Mr Pierson said federal and state parole agents failed to investigate his history of sexual crimes and instead relied on reports from psychiatrists.

This led to agents missing numerous warning signs over dozens of visits, allowing David Garrido to continue holding Dugard and seeking other victims.

‘Had the federal parole agents searched the Garrido residence they would have found her,’ the report states.

The report says Garrido's federal parole agent only visited his home once between May 1991 and May 1995 - in addition to the dozens of incidents in which David Garrido should have had his parole revoked.

Mr Pierson said he hoped his report would begin a process of exploring potential legislative solutions that will help law enforcement do a better job of supervising and detecting sexual predators.
