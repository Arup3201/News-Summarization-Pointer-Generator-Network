A glimpse of actor Jamie Dornan topless, above, in the trailer for forthcoming film 50 Shades Of Grey sent YouTube into meltdown, scoring a record breaking 100 million hits within a week. 

Now we can reveal how he developed his astonishing physique – indoor rock-climbing. Dornan, 32, a former Calvin Klein model, who stars as businessman Christian Grey in the film, has been spotted strutting around barechested at a London climbing gym, but no one bats an eyelid. 

‘You get really hot and sweaty climbing indoors so it’s quite normal for men to take off their tops,’ explained one onlooker.

‘Regular climbers generally have athletic bodies but Jamie looked like he’d been carved from marble.’ Once the preserve of daredevils, rock-climbing has gone mainstream, with five million visits to indoor walls each year, according to the British Mountaineering Council. 

But while Jamie scored top marks for his physique, his technique may need attention. 

‘He started off trying some advanced climbs but ended up on the beginner walls,’ the onlooker said. 

Sophie de Oliveira creates experimental limbs that give amputees the chance to wear the most exquisite bespoke alternatives to conventional replacements

Designer Limbs - with added sparkle

The world of prosthetics may never be the same again if the incredible designs of special effects expert Sophie de Oliveira catch on. 

Sophie, who has an art and sculpture background, creates experimental limbs that give amputees the chance to wear the most exquisite bespoke alternatives to conventional replacements. 

She hopes her creations will encourage amputees to express themselves by choosing anything from her delicate henna arm to a bejewelled ‘stereo leg’, left. 

But if you’d rather not stand out, Sophie’s work in television and film means she also creates staggeringly realistic limbs, feet, toes and fingers. For further details, visit thealternativelimbproject.com

Britons have some of the least salty palates in the world – if our tastes in junk food are anything to go by. 

Campaigners from World Action On Salt And Health (WASH) compiled a list comparing the salt content of burgers and fries in countries across the world. 

British Big Macs had the lowest salt content, with 2.1g. Those in Malaysia contained 2.7g, with Singapore, Guatemala and Canada not far behind. 

The UK guideline is 6g a day. ‘More still needs to be done,’ said WASH spokeswoman Clare Farrand.

Five steps to dodging strokes 

Women can dramatically reduce their risk of stroke by adhering to the five factors that constitute a healthy lifestyle – a diet rich in fruit and vegetables, moderate alcohol consumption, not smoking, being physically active and having a Body Mass Index under 25. 

It is one of the most dreaded symptoms of the menopause: the embarrassing and uncomfortable hot flush. 

Now, researchers have suggested a morning cup of coffee could make them worse. Studies at US hospital The Mayo Clinic found 85 per cent of women surveyed who suffered hot flushes also consumed caffeine in tea, coffee and fizzy drinks, 20 per cent more than menopausal women as a whole. 

Researchers at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden studied 32,000 women over a decade and found that those that stuck most closely to the regime had a 54 per cent lower risk of stroke. A stroke occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off.
