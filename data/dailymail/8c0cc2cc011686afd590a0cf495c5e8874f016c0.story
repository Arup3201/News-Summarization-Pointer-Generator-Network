Propaganda? A European Commission official said it needs to 'start early' to convince children of the merits of the EU

The European Union has been accused of trying to 'brainwash' children after pupils all over the country were given pencil cases with its logo emblazoned across it.

The brightly-coloured pencil cases featuring the EU's 12-star logo were handed out to schoolchildren following an event encouraging teachers to forge links with the Commission.

The one-day conference was staged by Staffordshire County Council and was attended by 50 teachers to raise awareness of the EU in schools, it was reported.

However, critics fear the event and the subsequent gifts to pupils were attempts to brainwash schoolchildren into backing the EU.

'Taxpayers will 
be shocked to read the cash they pay to Brussels is being spent in this 
way. If schools want children to know about the EU, there are plenty of 
unbiased resources,' Andrew
 Allison, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, told the Express.

'Teachers don’t need to go to expensive conferences, and schools don’t need to buy books from the EU bookshop.'

Meanwhile Paul Nuttal, Ukip MEP, added that it was 'utterly wrong' that an organisation representing a 'highly controversial political position' should be allowed to spread its message in to schools.

The EU Commission denied the pencil 
cases amounted to propaganda, or that the conference had a political 
slant. Instead event's focus was to explore funding opportunities for 
the EU.

The scheme was part of the EU Comenius programme, aimed at schools, colleges and councils across and supported by the British Council, an EU spokesman said.

A total of 438 UK schools were funded to forge links with European counterparts in 2011, the spokesman told the Express, adding: 'The UK authorities vigorously promoted British involvement.'

Staffordshire County Council's cabinet member for schools, Liz Staples, said the event - which cost £3,500 - was 'purely educational' and there was no cost to the taxpayer.

Staffordshire County Council is understood to have received a formal complaint from a resident about the conference, which was held in November, which its legal department is now looking in to.
