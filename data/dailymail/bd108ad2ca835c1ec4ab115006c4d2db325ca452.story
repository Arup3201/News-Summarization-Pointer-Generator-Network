It is the first televised show of the awards season, or as co-host Allison Janney put it, the one where you ‘get to see all the stars before they get down to Oscar weight’.

But Allison's acerbic wit aside, it is the night when 'the people' get to pick their big winners in showbiz - and coming up trumps were stars Iggy Azalea, Melissa McCarthy and Kaley Cuoco, who were all in attendance at the Nokia Theatre in LA on Wednesday night.

First, The Big Bang Theory star Kaley dished out the award for Favourite Comedic Movie Actress to Melissa for the (critically derided, but commercially successful) movie Tammy, and poked fun at the recent controversy surrounding her comments on feminism in Redbook magazine.

Big win: Melissa McCarthy kicks off the People's Choice Awards as she is named Favourite Comedic Movie Actress, at the event held at the Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles 

Asked by actor Josh Gad whether she should really be presenting an award honoring (gasp) a woman (and not one dedicated to her husband Ryan Sweeting, we presume) Kaley quipped: 'I know, it's part of my apology tour'.

Next was Adam Sandler who picked up his ninth award, this time for Favourite Comedic Movie Actor, albeit for the negatively reviewed flop Blended.

Parenthood stars Monica Potter and Dax Shepherd presented the award for Favourite Hip Hop Artist – with Dax dryly suggesting they were chosen because ‘we’re in our forties and super white’. 

Popular gal: Iggy Azalea took home to award for Favourite Hip Hop Artist beating out Nicki Minaj

He's not worthy! Iggy joked that presenter Dax Shepherd had kept her up the night before, because she was watching him on his show Parenthood 

Not so Fancy: Iggy admitted she hadn't prepared anything for her speech, so kept it short and sweet as she took home to award for Favourite Hip Hop Artist 

Even she looks surprised! Kaley Cuoco beat Amy Poehler and Melissa McCarthy to be named Favourite Comedic TV Actress for The Big Bang Theory

The Big Gong Theory! Kaley looked delighted to accept her huge trophy on the night

Giving it some (selfie) stick! Josh Gad, Kaley Cuoco and Kevin Hart lark about on stage as they present the award for Favourite Comedic Movie Actress 

No controversy here! Josh joked if Kaley should be honoring a woman (Melissa McCarthy) at the event, considering her comments on feminism to Redbook magazine 

Iggy Azalea won the award, joking that Dax was the reason she was late to the show because she was up all night watching him on Parenthood.

‘I didn’t expect this so I wrote nothing,’ Iggy said, keeping her acceptance speech simple. 'It's definitely not lost on me.'

The mood then went from hip-hop to country, as Lady Antebellum took to the stage to perform their new song Freestyle.

And country star Hunter Hayes was then named Favourite Male Country Artist. 

Ellen DeGeneres made a big impressed as she handed the prestigious TV Icon Award to Golden Girls legend Betty White, who received a standing ovation (and was walked to the stage by the super hunky Chris Evans). 

Presenting: Boyhood star Patricia Arquette gave Matt Bomer the award for Favourite Cable TV Actor 

‘When Melissa McCarthy came up on stage and she said she would stay with us as long as you let her, well you’ve abused the privilege with me!’ Betty said. 

‘I cannot possibly say thank you, can you imagine… the People’s Choice… at 93?! Thank you with all my heart,’ she gushed.

2 Broke Girls stars Kat Dennings and Beth Behrs – who hosted the show last year – followed Betty’s triumph, to present the award for Favourite Action Movie Actor.

The gong went to Captain America himself, Chris Evans, who seemed genuinely pleased with the result, claiming that he doesn't usually win things. 

'30 to 40% of the votes came from my mom,' he added.

Boyhood actress Patricia Arquette then awarded Matt Bomer with the gong for Favourite Cable TV Actor for his work on White Collar, beating out the likes of Sons Of Anarchy star Charlie Hunnam.

Cute couple: Ellen DeGeneres held hands with her gorgeous gal Portia Di Rossi in the audience 

Golden Girl: Ellen honored legend Betty White, 93, presenting her the award for Favourite TV Icon 

Star of the night: Oscar-nominated actress Amy Adams couldn't wait to get her picture with Betty 

Kaley Cuoco was named Favourite TV Comedic Actress, but failed to say anything further on her feminism controversy.

‘The fans at People’s Choice you guys rock! I know most of those votes are from my parents but there you go,' she said, somewhat stealing the same joke from Chris Evans. 

‘I love playing Penny I hope to be playing her for many years. And hey if you want to see The Wedding Ringer on January 14th, go for it!' she added, with a shameless plug for her new movie. 

No wonder she looks happy! Betty was helped to the stage by hunk Chris Evans 

First timers: This was the first year that Anna Faris and Allison Janney hosted the ceremony, after losing in their respective categories the year before

Amazingly, Kaley beat Amy Poehler and Melissa McCarthy.

Amy Adams arrived on stage talk about actor Ben Affleck, praising him for his charitable efforts that got him voted the Favourite Humanitarian on the night.

'This is very heavy, if anyone breaks into my house… watch out!’ Ben joked before getting serious.

Big honors: Big Eyes actress Amy Adams introduced Ben Affleck to the stage, who was named Favourite Humanitarian 

Captain Ameri-Phwoar! Hunk Chris Evans took to the stage to accept his award for Favourite Action Movie Actor 

Looking for a dime! 2 Broke Girls stars Kat Dennings and Beth Behrs cuddled up to Chris backstage, after presenting him with his award 

‘It’s a hard thing to accept,’ he said, talking of his humanitarian status. ‘I accept this award on behalf of the people of the Eastern Congo Initiative,’ he added. 

Following Ben, was Entourage star Adrian Grenier who announced Chloe Grace Moretz as the winner of Favourite Dramatic Movie Actress.

‘I would love to dedicate this movie to my Grandmother who passed away last year,’ Chloe said sweetly.

The Big Bang Theory celebrations: Mayim, Simon Helberg, Kunal Nayyar, Melissa, Jim Parsons, Kaley and Johnny Galecki pose backstage after scooping two awards 

Double trouble: Caste actress Stana Katic posed with two awards, one for her and one for the show 

Ellen Pompeo picked up the award Favourite Dramatic TV Actress, with Grey’s Anatomy bagging Favourite Network TV Drama. 

Rightly so, Viola Davis picked up the award for Favourite Actress In A New TV Series, for her hit show How To Get Away With Murder. 

Viola may have also won the award for best speech, after she thanked ABC producers for casting someone with her 'classic beauty' a surefire dig at the New York Times article that suggested she was otherwise. 

Mom and daughter? Hosts Anna and Allison looked more like sisters as they took the stage in a number of different outfits on the evening 

Gettin' Iggy with it: Azalea later put on a raunchy performance of her new single Beg For It 

Showstopper: Iggy got the crowd moving with her new hit, including Kaley Cuoco who seen dancing in the audience

Modern Family star then introduced performer Iggy Azalea, who rapped her way through her new hit Beg For It.

The highlight of Iggy's performance though, was how the tune made Kaley Cuoco break out some classic 'dad dancing' in the audience.

Ginnifer Goodwin and Jane The Virgin Star Gina Rodriguez were next up, presenting the award for Favourite Movie Actor.

Iron Man star Robert Downey Jr. took the honor, and also the award for Favourite Movie Actor in a Drama.

Calling for back up: Backstage Robert Downey Jr. was comforted by Ginnifer Goodwin and Gina Rodriguez 

Closing the show on a high note were The Big Bang Theory cast who took home two, for Favourite TV Show (beating Game Of Thrones!) and Favourite TV Network Comedy. 

First-time hosts (and Mom co-stars) Anna Faris and Allison Janney did a sterling job with their jokes, which included poking fun at huge budget of The Big Bang Theory (the main cast of which demand up to $1 million per episode).

The pair joked that not only is the food better than they get on the set of Mom, but The Big Bang Theory cast are also treated to their own 'massage tent'. Probably. 

And the laughs came thick and fast early on, as Allison told the audience: 'We are completely live, so keep everything clean - especially you Betty White.'

Now it's time for you to top that, Amy Poehler and Tina Fey, as The Golden Globes is set to roll on awards season this Sunday.

This is the skit! Anna Faris roped in husband Chris Pratt to kick off the show in a pre-recorded sketch 

Bad Nanny: The skit showed Allison Janney looking after Chris and Anna's child while smoking a cigar
