Writer Samantha Brick might have slammed the best-selling novel as 'badly written porn' but a bold new survey shows that Britain's women have been inspired by bestselling erotic book Fifty Shades Of Grey.

Reports reveal that an increasing number of women have been inspired to try a slew of new tricks in the bedroom - including introducing blindfolds and handcuffs and creating their own mini ‘playrooms’.

Almost 80 per cent admitted they found the idea of succumbing to a dominant male like Christian Grey a turn on.

And 90 per cent of men confessed they were turned on by the idea of a woman being submissive, like Ana, the virgin character in Fifty Shades Of Grey.

Upgrading: Inspired by the relationship between young virgin Ana and her billionaire lover Christian Grey in the Fifty Shades of Grey series, student Liya Step sought out her own rich boyfriend

Forty three per cent of those questioned said they were now more likely to use handcuffs in sexual role play, while 47 per cent confessed they wanted to experiment with blindfolds and other bondage gear after reading the X-rated book.

Not only has the book spiced up our
 sex lives, but the EL James novel, which focuses on the relationship 
between a domineering billionaire and a young, innocent student, has 
also sparked a boom in women seeking a super-rich partner of their own. 

Luxury lifestyle: Liya, whose lover flies her around the world on holidays, says the Fifty Shades effect has spiced up her sex life too

Dating website seekingarrangement.com 
commissioned the survey among its 1.5m members and found that a 
quarter of the girls were keen to have their own version of the dom-sub relationship between the key 
characters Christian and Ana.

Fashion student Liya Step is typical of the women using the site to find her very own Christian.

The 22 year old from Rochester, Kent doesn't look like she would have any difficulty attracting men.

But
 this pretty brunette doesn't want just any man. She is after an older, 
wealthy gent who can afford to pay to date her, fund her shoe habit and 
fly 
her around the world on five star holidays.

Liya is currently in a ‘mutually beneficial relationship’ with a man she met on the site.

She is paid an agreed monthly 
allowance and has recently enjoyed a holiday at a luxury resort in the 
Caribbean with her lover, a London businessman aged 43 who made his 
millions working in IT.

She enjoys the ‘arrangement’ she has 
with her sugar daddy - an agreement that many have likened to the ‘contract’ 
Anastasia enjoys with Christian in Fifty Shades of Grey.

She says: 'We just have a great time and really enjoy each others' company.

'And like Christian and Anastasia, we are madly in love.'

Liya adds: 'Yes, we have an agreement but there is nothing sinister and I don’t have to do anything I don’t want.'

She has a wardrobe packed with 
designer labels including £500 Christian Louboutin heels bought by her
 lover.

He also flies her around the world and treats her to meals in 
Michelin-starred restaurants.

Since signing up to the website 
(membership is free for women), Liya has been able to meet a number of richer 
‘Christian Greys’ who are willing to pay her to date them and lavish her
 with gifts.

Benefits: A designer wardrobe and monthly allowance is part of Liya's romantic arrangement

But she has been in a relationship with her current sugar daddy for the last nine months.

'He helps me with my expenses and pays me a generous monthly allowance to help with my costs as a student,” she says.

'We get on brilliantly and he is the kind of man I would have dated if I had not met him through the site.

'I hadn’t dated older guys before but
 it is exciting meeting men who have the dynamism to set up their own 
businesses and make millions of pounds.

'They don’t just want a pretty girl on their arm - they want an intellectual equal. I hope I provide that.'

And Liya believes that Fifty Shades has had a huge influence on couple’s sexual habits.

She says: 'Fifty Shades has opened 
people’s eyes to all sorts of new things.

It has made us all a lot more 
adventurous in the bedroom.

'I don’t think many couples are 
copying some of the extremes in the book, but they are mixing it up a 
bit and experimenting. It is fun.”

SeekingArrangement.com owner Brandon 
Wade, 41, met his wife Tanya, 26, through the site.

He says: 'Fifty 
Shades of Grey epitomises what is actually happening every day on our 
site.

'It is a story based on money, power and sex.

'Most women love the Cinderella story where a young innocent girl is swept off her feet by a rich, powerful and handsome man.'

This month the novel became the world's fastest-selling paperback ahead of J K Rowling's Harry Potter and Stephanie Meyer's Twilight series with sale exceeding one million copies.

Britisih author EL James has now signed a publishing deal worth an estimated £4million as well as signing a movie contract for her debut novel.

Last week Fifty Shades Of Grey also became the number one best-selling Kindle book of all time at Amazon.co.uk selling over one million 'e' copies.
