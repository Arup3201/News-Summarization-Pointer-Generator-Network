An 8-year-old Cincinnati boy was fatally shot in the chest on Saturday 
while one of his brothers was playing with a loaded handgun that he 
thought was a BB gun, police said.

Cincinnati police Lt. Don Luck
 told the Cincinnati Enquirer that three brothers were visiting their 
uncle in the city's Price Hill neighborhood when they found the loaded 
gun and one pulled the trigger, striking Sammy Lorenzo in the chest.

The boy was taken to Cincinnati Children's Hospital and rushed into surgery, but later died.

Cincinnati police remove an adult witness after authorities say Sammy Lorenzo, 8, was shot and killed while his brother was playing with a gun

The shooting occured at the boy's uncle's house in the Price Hill neighborhood of Cincinnati

One of the brothers 'kept telling the story of how it happened, over and over again,' Luck said. 'It's so sad.'

Luck
 said that no charges are expected against the children. He said it was 
too early to tell whether charges will be filed against any adults.

An unidentified adult was in the house at the time, but wasn't in the room when the boy was shot, police said.

'I
 think everyone is pretty much upset, considering the circumstances, and
 at this point we don’t know where the adult was inside the house and 
that’s why we’re conducting the investigation at this time,' Sgt. Jim 
Perkins told WLWT.

Cincinnati homicide detectives are investigating the case but concluded that the shooting was accidental.

Sammy's brother's name has not yet been released.

The
 Mail Online tried contacting the Cincinnati Police Department for 
further information about the case but on one was available for comment.
