A distraught mother was forced to listen to her autistic son being taunted by school bus staff after she planted a tape recorder in his back pack when he came home with bumps to the head. 

A civil trial began in Brooklyn, New 
York yesterday after elementary school pupil PJ Rossi was 
tormented by bus matron Connie Clark and driver Robert Fischetti.

The adults can be heard yelling at PJ, who cannot speak, making him so distressed that he screamed and beat his head against the bus window more than 50 times.

Nightmare journey: PJ Rossi, who is now 14, has severe autism and could not tell his parents that he was being tormented by a monitor and driver on the New York school bus

Lisa Rossi was horrified when she played the tape back to hear her son's agony during the hour-long bus ride to PS-37 in Great Kills, Staten Island.

According to the New York Post, jurors heard Clark say on the 2005 recording: 'Shut up!... We got a crazy kid here.'

PJ was then taunted with cupcakes and cookies by the driver Fischetti and called a 'knucklehead'.

Mrs
Rossi and her husband Paul said their son, 
now 14, was held back in his development by the cruel treatment and were 
seeking unspecified damages in civil court. 

Child endangerment charges were brought against Clark last year after the bullying and she was fired from her job.

The 53-year-old school bus matron took a no-jail misdemeanor plea.

Furious: Paul Rossi has brought a civil suit after his son PJ, who has autism and cannot speak, was bullied by bus staff

Mr Rossi told the New York Post at the time: 'After all this time, my family is pleased that we may see some justice for PJ.'

The
lawsuit has been brought against the Department of Education and 
Atlantic Express bus company.

The family's lawyer called for better training for staff 
who deal with children who have disabilities.

However a lawyer for the bus company responded that it was not up to their employees to take on the role of someone with specialized care skills.
