A family has been left unable to cook or clean after their £10,000 kitchen installation was scrapped by Tesco on the day it should have been delivered.

Samantha and Gary Williams said they paid a deposit and a workman from Tesco visited to help the family plan their dream kitchen, before telling them it would be ready yesterday.

But as Mrs Williams waited for the kitchen yesterday, she received a call telling her it was no longer going to be delivered.

The family are just one of 1,000 paying Tesco customers to be left in the dark as the company is locked in 'discussions' with its contractor regarding the future of its kitchen and bathroom service.

Tesco has yet to provide any clarification on when, or if, their kitchen will be fitted

She claims Tesco told her the company they work with, kitchen and bathroom-fitting business Mark Two, have 'pulled their contract'.

The couple, who live with son Reece, 16, and nephew James, 30, even ripped out their previous kitchen to save workmen a job - so have been left with a derelict kitchen until the situation is resolved.

Mrs Williams, an underwriting team manager, said: 'We were all set to go yesterday but then we got a call to say 'we've got some bad news'.

'We are a family of four. What are we supposed to do? I can't cook, I can't clean, I can't do washing. They haven't got an answer for me so I'm lost as they've left us in limbo.

'We're having to visit family and friends for meals, and go to a launderette to do our washing. We can't eat here because there's nowhere to wash up. It's a health hazard.'

Tesco, which works with Mark Two to offer its kitchen service, has confirmed it is 'in discussions' regarding its kitchen service.

But it is yet to provide any answers  as to when the Williams' bespoke kitchen may be fitted.

She said: 'Apparently it's Mark Two that have messed up because they have pulled their contract with Tesco due to their recent profit losses.

Tesco sales this year have fallen at the fastest rate in the grocery industry. Last month it was revealed Britain's biggest grocer's like-for-like sales fell more than 3.7 per cent in the first quarter of 2014 – far worse than the 2.9 per cent drop in the previous three months.

This announcement came after former CEO Philip Clarke had announced his exit in June amid tumbling sales and profits.

Things worsened for the grocer two months ago when four executives at Tesco were suspended after the supermarket giant admitted it overstated its profits guidance by £250million - shares dived to their lowest level in 11 years.

On October 30,  the Serious Fraud Office started a full investigation into the company in the wake of the accounting scandal.

In total, eight senior executives lost their positions as the full scale of the scandal unfolded.

'When I have spoken to Tesco, they don't have a clue what's going on, but they've pulled the rug under our feet.

'Mark Two said the kitchen would be delivered on Monday but then said it wouldn't.

'I have paid a deposit and if I need to organise another kitchen I can't do so until I get that back. If we have to start looking again, we won't get it fitted before Christmas.'

They are just one of a number of people whose kitchen plans have been thrown into disarray following news the company's contract with Mark Two is under review.

A Facebook page, titled 'Tesco Kitchens/Mark Two a travesty', has been created with dozens of customers registering complaints.

Several state Tesco has refunded their deposit, while others remain unaware of what is happening with their plans.

The Williams said they spent weeks planning their dream kitchen and worked with a personal co-ordinator to achieve their chosen design.

Mrs Williams said: 'We bought our house seven years ago and have only just been able to spend money doing it up.'

'We were looking for a kitchen and a design guy from Tesco came to design and plan it.

Fortunately the replacement didn't extend to the washer and drier, which remain in place

'He was with us for three hours and he was lovely. He planned it all and gave us a quote and then we just had to make a few tweaks before they said it would be ready on Monday.

'I feel stupid because I have recommended them to a colleague and I've had to go back and tell her what's happened to us, in case they have the same problem.'

In a statement, Tesco said there were 1,000 customers affected.

'We are currently in discussions with Mark Two, the company which runs our kitchen and bathroom-fitting business, about how we work with them in the future.

'We are committed to ensuring we do the right thing for our customers and will be contacting them to discuss the options available to them.'

A spokesperson for Mark Two did not respond to MailOnline's request for comment yesterday.
