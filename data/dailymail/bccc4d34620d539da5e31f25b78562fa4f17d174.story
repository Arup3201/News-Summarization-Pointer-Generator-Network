Goldman Sachs was let off a £20million tax bill to avoid embarrassing George Osborne, the High Court heard yesterday.

Revenue bosses are said to have stopped chasing Goldman Sachs for money it owed after the investment bank agreed to sign up to the Government’s flagship tax agreement – seen as a major coup for the Chancellor.

Senior officials at Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs are alleged to have granted Goldman Sachs a ‘sweetheart deal’  effectively cancelling the bill, because they feared the bank might otherwise back out of the agreement.

Let off: Bosses at HMRC are said to have stopped chasing Goldman Sachs for £20million of tax it owed after the investment bank agreed to sign up to the Government's flagship tax agreement

The deal between the HMRC and the bank resulted in taxpayers being left £20million out of pocket

The deal between HMRC and the bank was said to have caused ‘real disquiet among the tax-paying public’ and to have amounted to Goldman Sachs being ‘rewarded’ for several years of failing to pay the tax it owed.

In an email read in court, HMRC’s top tax official at the time, Dave Hartnett, warned colleagues that pursuing the bank for the outstanding money risked ‘major embarrassment to the Chancellor, HMRC, the LBS [a division of HMRC], you and me’.

In letting the bank off the bill, Mr Hartnett personally overruled legal advice, as well as HMRC’s own strict guidelines, the court heard.

The case dates back to 2005, when Goldman and four other banks were accused of avoiding tax on bonuses by funnelling them through a company in the British Virgin Islands.

While the other banks agreed to pay, Goldman refused and was warned by HMRC it faced racking up interest payments.

But in 2010, HMRC waived the £20million interest that had accumulated, after Goldman agreed to pay the original sum and sign the Government’s agreement.

HMRC’s internal review body criticised the move, and in-house lawyers said officials could pursue the money.

But a week after Goldman signed Mr Osborne’s agreement, Mr Hartnett decided not to re-open the case.

Ingrid Simler QC, representing tax campaign group UK Uncut Legal Action, said the deal between HMRC and Goldman Sachs should be ruled unlawful.

Mrs Simler argued the decision was ‘unreasonable and could not be justified on its own merits’.

She disclosed an email sent by Mr Hartnett to a colleague 48 hours before dropping the claim for the £20million owed.

In it he said Goldman Sachs ‘went off the deep end at the suggestion they should pay interest’ and described the internal review board as ‘something of a formality’.

HMRC’s guidelines state its officials should ‘not accept settlements for less than 100 per cent of tax and interest due’.

After being accused of lying to MPs last year, Mr Hartnett left HMRC and joined HSBC as an adviser on honesty.

He did not appear in court, but said in a written statement that Goldman’s signing of the tax agreement ‘would have been under threat had we reneged on the settlement’.

Mr Justice Nichol retired to consider his verdict on the case.
