Thousands of picture perfect Christmas Day snaps appeared on social media as families around the country got into the swing of the festive season.

People surfing in Santa hats, making snowmen out of sand and enjoying a beer on the beach were common trends on Christmas Day.

But what about those that opted for an offbeat-style Christmas?

As thousands of people shared photos of themselves at the beach on Christmas Day, many others opted for a quirkier style Christmas - and here's the photos to prove it

A car load of boys dressed as Santa spent the day cruising the streets in their vintage car

Photos have started to surface of the weird  ways people spent the jolliest day of the year - some are quirky and hilarious while others are just plain sad. 

Some spent the day dwelling on Christmas gifts from the past, namely an old and broken trampoline. 

Others styled Christmas trees out of beer bottles and left booze out for the unlucky garbage collectors working.

People photographed their Christmas-themed feasts, but one quirky family decided it was 'too hot' in Australia for the more common turkey and ham - they opted for a Sushi smorgasbord instead. 

An unlucky man in the IT industry was working over Christmas and decided to spend the festive holiday watching Guardians of the Galaxy with his feet on his desk.
