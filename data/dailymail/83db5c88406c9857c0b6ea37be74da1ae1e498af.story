Pictured for the first time together, here are Ensar Gol's alleged victims - his new wife and her mother smiling and happy in a bar.

Michaela Gol, 28, and 50-year-old Julie Sahin were found dead from multiple stab wounds at their home in Thame in the early hours of Sunday.

Today, police released this image of the blonde haired pair, while their family said in a statement: 'They were much loved and will always have a place in our hearts.'

Victims: Ensar Gol is accused of the murders of his new wife Michaela, left, and her mother, Julie Sahin, right, in Thame, Oxfordshire

Gol, 21, faced magistrates in Oxford yesterday accused of their murders and will appear at Oxford Crown Court today.

He was photographed being led into court from a prison van in handcuffs.

The Turkish national also faces a charge of the attempted murder of Casey Wilson, 19, who is a friend of his wife's family.

In court: Gol, left, grinning before entering Oxford Magistrates' Court yesterday and his wife, mother-of-two Michala Gol, 28, pictured with Gol

Miss Wilson remains in hospital receiving treatment for her injuries.

Gol, who wore a dark blue polo shirt,
light coloured trousers and blue trainers, was escorted into court room one yesterday by two dock officers.

Through a Turkish interpreter, Gol spoke only to confirm his name and date of birth during the brief hearing.

Sarah Mackay, prosecuting, told the court: 'Mr Gol is charged with two counts of murder and one of attempted murder.'

Investigation: A pair of forensic workers speak to a uniformed officers outside the house in Thame earlier this week

Ms Mackay added: 'Ensar Gol is a 21-year-old Turkish national and has only just recently entered the UK.'

Gol, of Thame, Oxfordshire, was remanded into custody and told to appear before Oxford Crown Court tomorrow.

Gol was arrested shortly after the victims' bodies were found at the terraced home on Sunday morning.

Post mortem examinations showed they both died of multiple stab wounds.

It is thought they were both stabbed in the neck and heart.

Paramedics desperately tried to revive the pair but they were pronounced dead at the scene.

Well-wishers: A woman carries a bunch of flowers to place at the scene of the tragedy

A Home Office pathologist was carrying out examinations in 
order to determine how Michala and her mother met their deaths.

Police said they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the stabbings.

Yesterday, officers
continued to surround the terraced family home as forensic officers handed bags of evidence to detectives at the
scene.

A police cordon remained in place across the entrance to 
the small cul-de-sac - broken only to allow neighbours access to their 
homes.

One group of well-wishers arrived at the house to place bunches of flowers at 
the scene.
