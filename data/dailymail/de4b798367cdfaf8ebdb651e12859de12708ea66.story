Neymar stole the show at the Estadio Serra Dourada on Tuesday night as the Brazil star scored a sensational free-kick to set his side up for a 4-0 friendly victory over Panama.

The frontman, who was at his skilful best as he produced some sublime tricks throughout the game, made no mistake as he curled the ball into the top corner past a diving Oscar McFarlane in the Panama goal.

Brazil doubled their advantage five minutes before the half-time interval courtesy of Neymar's Barcelona team-mate Dani Alves.

Subs not used: Parris, Chen, Barahona.

Booked: Cooper, Gomez, Tejada.

Referee: Raul Orozco (Bolivia)

The right-back worked himself into some space  just outside the box and shot through a crowded area to find the bottom corner.

Hulk extended the hosts' lead just a minute into the second-half, scoring with the outside of his right boot after latching onto Neymar's back heel.

The Zenit frontman amusingly celebrated his strike by doing the Macarena.

Willian, who replaced Chelsea team-mate Oscar midway through the second half, got his name on the scoresheet in the 77th minute, striking the ball into an unguarded net after Hulk's initial effort was deflected.

Panama looked like they would have to play the final ten minutes with ten men when Gabriel Gomez was sent off having been deemed to have stretched and handled in the area.

However, rather bizarrely, Bolivian referee Raul Orozco changed his mind and play continued.

Bemused supporters in the stands were excitedly waiting for Brazil to take the resultant spot-kick but instead watched on as Panama restarted the match.

Neymar's goal was the 200th of his career, and 31st with the national team. Amazingly, despite his impressive performance, the attacker feels he still has to improve for the World Cup.

'I'm still not ready. I got tired there at the end,' said Neymar. 'Little by little in practice I'm improving and getting better physically. There are still nine days left.'

Beaming: Willian couldn't hide his delight after coming off the bench to score Brazil's fourth goal

Julio Cesar - 7

Brazil's No 1 was a commanding presence throughout. Made one spectacular save, recovering from a slip to make an acrobatic leap to tip a looping header over the bar.

Oscar - 5

Looked lost positionally and was completely overshadowed by the brilliant Neymar. He wants to play behind the striker but he often ended up out on the left, with Scolari preferring to use the Barca man in the hole. His place for the World Cup opener looks under threat as he doesn't have the pace to operate out wide. 

Ramires - 5.5

Struggled in the opening 15 minutes as Panama started the better of the two. Improved but was withdrawn at half-time - Brazil were much more confident on the ball with his replacement, Hernanes, but by then Panama had given up.

Willian - 7

Came on and provided much needed width, allowing Neymar more space in the middle. Scored and could be in line to start the opener if Scolari elects to play Neymar as a second striker

Fernandinho - N/A

Unused substitute.

Paulinho - N/A

Unused substitute.
