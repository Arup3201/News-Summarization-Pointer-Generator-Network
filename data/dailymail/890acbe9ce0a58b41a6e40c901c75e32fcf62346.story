Ten years ago at the precocious age of 13 Tommy Fleetwood was first picked for Lancashire’s senior golf team and a suitable playing partner was sought for him.

That turned out to be fellow Southport lad Matthew Baldwin, five years his senior, and on Thursday afternoon — playing within three groups of each other — they will line up for the first time in the starting field of The Open.

With Wirral factory worker John Singleton, the 30-year-old Cinderella figure at this year’s event, they make up a three-strong Merseyside contingent at Hoylake. And with due respect to golf’s finest forklift truck driver, the two younger men are much more likely to play in future Opens.

Inside knowledge: Tommy Fleetwood has played Royal Liverpool a lot as an amateur

Fleetwood, now 23, recalls his shyness when he first met Baldwin: ‘We were playing against Britain’s Curtis Cup squad (the women’s amateur team) in a practice match. Basically, I was thrown in. He looked after me.’

Thursday is another debut for Fleetwood, reckoned to be a seriously good prospect, and again he is glad to have a local connection as he tackles his first major. ‘I’ve played Royal Liverpool a lot as an amateur so I know the course well,’ said Fleetwood.

‘The only problem is that I don’t have a clue which hole I’m on because they’ve changed the numbers.’

Hoylake alters its sequence for The Open so the usual 17th and 18th holes become the first and second, allowing the par-five 16th to become the dramatic closing hole.

Southport might be thinly populated, given the numbers heading down to the Wirral to support its two most prominent golfers.

The local football club may have long since lost its League status but Southport is a golfing hotbed boasting many  top-class courses.

‘It’s not called England’s golf coast for nothing,’ said Baldwin, whose grandfather Ron Ryder played rugby league for Great Britain, and in the Challenge Cup final for Warrington.

‘We’ve got Royal Birkdale, Southport and Ainsdale, Hillside, Formby, West Lancs is not far away — all top courses. I should mention Hesketh too, because I grew up in a house behind the 17th green and that’s where I learned to play.

‘I wouldn’t say we push each other. Tommy is younger — he’s a proper talent and self-driven. Links golf suits us. We’ve played a lot here, so there’s no reason we can’t do well.’

And Fleetwood believes they will not be the last locals to make the grade. ‘There are quite a few juniors about where we’re from and some of them are good,’ he said.

‘It can’t do any harm to have two of us playing at The Open.’

Against the odds: Forklift truck driver John Singleton is a 1000-1 shot to win The Open

Both men will have friends and family in the gallery but they are unlikely to have as much support as 1000-1 shot Singleton, who works a few miles away in Moreton for AEV Varnishes and came through qualifying at Hillside.

The factory employs 25 people and half will be given the day off today to watch and half tomorrow — all hoping their colleague makes the cut and is still around at the weekend.

Singleton — who spends his working day driving the forklifts and mixing resin — had planned to volunteer as a Hoylake marshal. Instead, he tees off this morning with American Peter Uihlein and Scotland’s Marc Warren.

Depending on the next few days, Singleton may consider giving professional golf another go, having once tried via the American college system. ‘I’ve got nothing to lose,’ he said. ‘No-one expects anything from me, so I’m just going to enjoy myself.’
