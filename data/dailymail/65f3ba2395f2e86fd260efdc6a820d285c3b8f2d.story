Apology: Circuit Judge Mike Maggio has admitted posting confidential case information online

An Arkansas judge has admitted to posting a series of anonymous online comments, including ones that divulged secret information about Charlize Theron's adoption of her son.

Circuit Judge Mike Maggio, 52, acknowledged on
 Wednesday that he also posted comments that are racist, sexist and offensive towards the LGBT community over the past several years.

Maggio, who also ended his campaign for a seat on the Arkansas Court of Appeals on Wednesday, made the comments on a Louisiana State University 
fan message board, under the name 'geauxjudge'.

Comments in January 2012 divulged details of Theron's adoption two months before she publicly released the information, while others talked about women in a derogatory way and another likened bestiality to sex in the transgender and gay communities.

'I take full responsibility for the comments that have been attributed to me,' Maggio, a father-of-five, said in a statement. 'I apologize deeply for my lapse in personal judgment and for that, I have no excuse. The comments posted were not acceptable. These comments are not a reflection of who I am.'

The state's Judicial Discipline and 
Disability Commission is investigating Maggio's postings, said its 
executive director, David Sachar.

Maggio,
 whose term as a 20th Judicial District judge expires this 
year, asked for privacy for his family. He has three sons and two daughters from a previous relationship and lives with his partner, Dawn.

Revealed: He divulged that Charlize Theron had adopted a son two months before she announced it publicly in 2012. She is pictured in 2013 with the boy, Jackson, whom she adopted from South Africa

Confidential: Postings on the website TigerDroppings.com show him discussing confidential information

Offensive: He provided the details about her adoption in January 2012 - 2 months before it was public

He didn't immediately respond to
 an email or phone message left at his office.

Political
 blogger Matt Campbell first suggested that 'geauxjudge' was Maggio in a
 Monday posting on his website, Blue Hog Report.

He included screen grabs of 
'geauxjudge' postings from the past few years, including some that 
dropped biographical hints that led to his identification.

In a January 17,
 2012, posting, he disclosed what he said were details of 
Theron's adoption case - two months before she publicly revealed 
she had adopted a son, Jackson, from South Africa.

Concerning opnions: Maggio, who has five children, is pictured with his partner, Dawn, left and right

Bowing out: On Wednesday, he ended his campaign for a seat on the Arkansas Court of Appeals

Inappropriate: He made offensive remarks about how people's names determine if they are criminals

He
 said a 'judge friend' handled the case, before admitting that he was alsoÂ 
involved in the case. When a poster asked if she had adopted a black
 child, he said that she had.

Such
 proceedings are confidential in Arkansas, and there are no cases in the
 state's online court records that mention Theron's name. Her publicist,
 Amanda Silverman, declined to comment.

In a June 2011 posting, 'geauxjudge' 
suggested that women who seek divorces after their husbands cheat may be
 better off financially by staying married. In Arkansas, circuit judges 
like Maggio handle divorce cases, among other civil and criminal 
casework.

'I see it 
everyday,' he wrote. 'A woman makes (an) emotional decision to divorce 
because the husband stepped out. When otherwise he was a good provider, 
father, and husband.

'Then a
 year or two later realizes uh oh I am worse off financially, 
emotionally and relationship wise but hey they showed that SOB. Too many
 times the women get their advice from other divorced women.'

Cruel: Maggio also made sexist remarks (top) and compared bestiality to 'TBBLBS sex' an apparent reference to transgender, gay, lesbian or bisexual sex (bottom). He has admitted to the remarks

In another, he made derogatory comments about women, saying they needed to take care of a man's two basic needs for sex and food, adding: 'It takes two to pull the wagon'.

In a posting from last December about baby names, 'geauxjudge' wrote about the effect a name can have on an individual's success, the website reported.

'How many Doctors do you hear named Dr. Taneesha or HaHa?' he wrote, apparently referring to Ha'Sean 'Ha Ha' Clinton-Dix, a black University of Alabama football player.

'How many bankers do (you) hear named Brylee? So stick with something close to normal. Or come sit in criminal court any day and see the "common names".'

Responding to a story about a woman who was arrested for allegedly having sex with a dog, 'geauxjudge' wrote that it was 'just a small step' from having 'TGGLBS' sex, an apparent reference to transgender, gay, lesbian or bisexual sex.
