Tom Greatrex said football fans needed protection from owners looking to cash in on stadiums

Football fans should get a veto before millionaire owners sell off their club's ground and move to cheaper out-of-town stadiums, MPs said today.

The government was urged to introduce a statutory consultation with fans on any proposed change of use in football grounds to protect clubs and stadiums from 'asset stripping'.

It came after minister were also urged to ban live Premiership games on Remembrance Sunday out of respect for the fallen.

Labour MP Tom Greatrex, a Fulham fan, said football fans needed protecting from out-of-touch owners looking to cash in on stadiums situated in expensive areas.

He said some grounds will prove more profitable if they are used for something other than football and so some fans are uncertain about their clubs remaining in their original community.

Sport Minister Helen Grant said the Government's expert working group on football supporter ownership and engagement has been set up to deal with issues like this.

Mr Greatrex, MP for Rutherglen and Hamilton West, asked Ms Grant: 'There are clubs whose grounds are potentially worth more for other purposes than football and there is uncertainty about clubs maintaining their links with communities.

'Fortunately, in relation to Fulham, despite misguided property speculators and ill-advised owners in the past, we have managed to survive at Craven Cottage, which is an iconic football ground and part of the English football fabric.

'But are you aware of the concerns that people have and fans have and therefore do you think it's a good idea for there to be statutory consultation on ensuring that any change of use of football grounds is done with fans in mind to protect grounds from those sorts of asset stripping?'

Ms Grant replied: 'You make an important point and the whole reason for the setting up of this expert group is so that fans can air their views and it will give them profile and a good platform and I'm sure issues such as this will be raised and reported to me in due course.'

The Sports minister also faced calls to ban Sky Sports televising football games on Remembrance Sundays.

Shadow minister Sharon Hodgson said games which fall on that date should be rescheduled in order to 'respect the original intentions of this special day'.

She said this meant remembering those who had died for the country.

Four top-flight games took place on Remembrance Sunday last November, with Newcastle United's trip to West Brom and Swansea versus Arsenal screened live on Sky.

A minute's silence was observed at football games across the country over the weekend.

Fixtures for the 2015/16 season will be announced in the summer.

Shadow minister Sharon Hodgson said games which fall on that date should be rescheduled in order to 'respect the original intentions of this special day'

Speaking in the Commons, Ms Hodgson told Ms Grant: 'As we're well into the 100-year commemorations of the First World War would you reassure the House, veterans in my area as well as my local armed forces network that you will ask Sky to reconsider the scheduling of their broadcast of their matches on Remembrance Sunday, which has happened in Sunderland two years in a row, and instead schedule the games for the Saturday so as to respect the original intentions of this special day - remembering those who give their lives for our country.'

Ms Grant replied: 'It is important to always remember those who sacrifice their lives for our country. I'm very happy to have a chat with you on those issues.'
