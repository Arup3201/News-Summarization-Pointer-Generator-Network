A British family survived a horrific air crash in Burma yesterday when their packed plane came down in heavy fog and burst into flames.

One of the Britons was injured when the Fokker 100, carrying 65 Christmas holidaymakers, smashed into the ground two miles short of its destination.

Three Burmese were killed in the tragedy – a tour guide and an 11-year-old child on board the plane, as well as a man riding a motorcycle on the road where it came down.

Wreckage: Four Britons are believed to have been on board the jet in Burma

More than 50 of the 65 passengers were said to be non-Burmese. Two Americans and a Korean were also among the injured.

The Air Bagan jet from Mandalay 
crashed as it approached Heho airport in the east of Burma, gateway to 
the popular tourist destination Inle Lake.

An airport official said: ‘The aircraft was extensively damaged. People who got out can count themselves extremely fortunate.’

A local tour guide waiting at the airport for passengers said the fire had ‘burned almost the whole plane’.

The airline described the incident as an ‘emergency landing’.

Fire was said to have broken out in 
one of the plane’s engines and it reportedly struck part of a mountain 
as it approached Heho airport in fog. Authorities however gave a 
different account, saying the pilot mistook the road for a runway due to
bad weather.

‘While descending, the plane mistakenly landed due to fog,’ state television reported.

It said the aircraft made a hard landing on a road and then came to a stop in a rice paddy field.

‘The rear end of the plane broke and 
caught fire,’ state TV said, carrying a statement posted on deputy 
information minister Ye Htut’s Facebook page.

Rescuers managed to bring the fire under control about 45 minutes later, he said.

Witnesses said smoke filled the plane 
when it hit the ground  and was still rising from the aircraft’s 
badly-charred wreckage hours later.

One of the two pilots of the jet 
operated by the private airline was among the injured, according to 
initial reports. The British family was said to be being helped by UK 
consular officials.

Air Bagan is owned by Tay Za, a tycoon
known for his close links to the former military junta. The airline had
two Fokker 100 jets, which are no longer manufactured. The injured 
passengers were taken to hospital in the city of Taunggyi for treatment 
for broken bones, burns, cuts and shock.

First pictures of the scene of the 
crash reveal how lucky anyone was to get out alive. The aircraft lay in 
pieces in a field with soldiers guarding the wreckage. An airline check 
of the passengers revealed that one was missing.

A search of the wreckage revealed a 
body, believed to be that of the 11-year-old child. Air Bagan is one of 
several domestic carriers seeking to profit from the tourist boom as 
Burma emerges from military rule.

There has been an increase in tourism 
in the past 12 months as the ruling junta has relaxed its  control and, 
for the first time in decades, opened up the country  to foreigners.
