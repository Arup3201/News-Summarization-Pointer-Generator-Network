Unimpressed: The Rev Sally Hitchiner (pictured), senior chaplain at Brunel University, said spirituality seemed to be taking a back seat in the new format

Broadcasting services from parishes and cathedrals across the country, for more than 50 years Songs of Praise has been much loved as the BBC’s flagship religious programme.

But after a relaunch as a magazine-style programme earlier this month in a move to attract a wider audience, loyal viewers have been left feeling it is becoming little more than ‘the One Show with added hymns’.

And even the clergy has hit out at the new format, with the Reverend Sally Hitchiner leading calls to bring ‘actual worship’ back into the programme, claiming it no longer felt ‘authentic’ and that spirituality seemed to be taking a backseat.

Rev Hitchiner, senior chaplain at Brunel University in West London, tweeted: ‘Thinking of starting a campaign to get #SongsOfPraise to bring back actual worship eg bible reading & prayers...Thora would agree with me!’

She was referring to actress Dame Thora Hird, a committed Christian who presented Songs of Praise spin-off Praise Be!

This followed her appearance on Points of View, on which she echoed the concerns of many viewers who remain unimpressed with the new style of the weekly programme.

She was one of three clergy to appear on the show, alongside Rev Yemi Adedeji, an Anglican Priest and Pentecostal Pastor, and Fr Alexander Lucie-Smith, a Catholic Parish Priest, who agreed spirituality seemed to take a backseat in the new format.

After watching the first new-style episode, Rev Hitchiner said: ‘I think there is a question as to whether or not this is inspiring us to worship or whether it’s just a whole load of nice people doing something in their community - and Songs of Praise should be about worship.

‘I did enjoy it, I think it didn’t feel authentic enough for me though, they need to go further, risk more, to have genuine Christian faith represented because it’s a lifeline for many older people.’

These sentiments were echoed by Rev Adedeji, who said: ‘In terms of representation of denomination, expression of type of worship, this has done a great job. But in terms of spirituality you might reconsider that.’

The relaunch took place earlier this month and saw the traditional format of a single Anglican service being recorded dropped in favour of each show featuring a world of locations and denominations, as well as news segments on faith around the world – for example, the first episode included a report on the persecution of Christians in Syria.

Aaqil Ahmed, the BBC’s head of religion, has previously explained the move is designed to widen the show’s audience.

He said the average Songs of Praise viewer is in their mid-70s - with viewers in their 50s, who would usually ‘replenish’ the older audience, lacking the religious ‘interest and knowledge’ that would attract them to Songs of Praise.

He said this was in contrast to the congregations at Pentecostal and Catholic churches which are growing due to immigration - and therefore offered a new audience.

However, many of the show’s long-term viewers have been left unhappy by the shift.

Viewer Joey Knock said that while he liked the inclusion of religious current affairs in the new format, ‘I’m also a bit worried it will turn into the One Show with added hymns’.

One contacted Points of View and said: ‘You have spoilt our Sundays. Good job our parents weren’t here to see what you have done to Songs of Praise’, while another added: ‘Does the BBC not realise that for a lot of people this is the only religious experience they can enjoy?’

In response to the concerns, Mr Ahmed told Points of View: ‘Songs of Praise has been going for 54 years and in those 54 years it’s evolved many, many times.

‘This is just one of many evolutions we’ve seen in the show. Traditional Anglican worship will still be part of it as it always has been. So in that sense I would reassure all our viewers and say give it a chance.

‘With the changes in how Christianity is evolving in this country, with the various different denominations, people coming from abroad, the growth in evangelical Christianity, Alpha, etc, all these things, we felt it was really relevant to get as much of that in one episode each week as possible and make it more accessible to more people on a weekly basis’.

Some viewers also jumped in to defend the change, with one telling Points of View: ‘When I heard there were going to be changes I was a little bit concerned because I do so enjoy it but it was wonderful’, and another adding that it was now ‘a better representation of modern Christianity, the different styles of worship and praise’.
