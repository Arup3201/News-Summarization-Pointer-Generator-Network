Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini is sweating on the fitness of his captain Vincent Kompany for the midweek trip to Sunderland after was he forced off injured in the closing stages of his side's 3-0 win at Southampton on Sunday.

City closed the gap on leaders Chelsea to just six points with the win at St Mary's, after second-half goals from Yaya Toure, Frank Lampard and Gael Clichy secured all three points for the visitors.

But Pellegrini had plenty to ponder after the game though, with Eliaquim Mangala seeing red with 16 minutes remaining, as well as Kompany going off with a hamstring complaint.

Pellegrini said after the game: 'We cannot know the situation at the moment. He (Kompany) has a problem with his hamstring.

'We will see with the doctor how important it is but at this moment, I cannot tell you exactly what he has. We will see.

'Of course, we don't have both of them [Kompany and Mangala] but we have Martin Demichelis and Dedryck Boyata - he is working very well. Bacary Sagna can also play at centre back too.

'We will see what we can do for the next game. At the moment, it is important to celebrate this triumph.'
