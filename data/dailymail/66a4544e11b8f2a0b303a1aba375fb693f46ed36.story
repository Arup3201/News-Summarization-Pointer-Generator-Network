Shoppers have been using foreign coins instead of £2 coins in some self-service tills in Morrisons

A supermarket is refusing to let shoppers pay with £2 coins at self-service tills after discovering that people were paying with similar-sized foreign coins.

Bosses at Morrisons say a steep rise in the numbers of shoppers paying with coins from overseas meant they have had to refuse to accept £2 coins at automated check-outs at some of their stores in the West Midlands until they can fix the technology.

They say the most common offenders are Iranian 250 rial coins, and Thai ten bath pieces.

A spokesman for the supermarket chain said: 'A number of stores have had foreign currency passed off as £2 coins at self-checkouts.

'While we fix the issue, we have temporarily stopped them accepting any £2 coins, although customers are still free to use them at all manned checkouts.

'We apologise for any inconvenience it is causing, but don’t expect the fix to take long.'

A spokesman for coin experts, Jewellery Quarter Bullion, said: 'The key with these machines is weight and diameter. A £2 coin weighs 12 grammes.

'It may well be that shoppers are not looking to rip anyone off - in some cases, there is very little difference in currency value.

'They may simply be trying to use change they gathered while holidaying abroad.'

It was long believed £2 coins would be too expensive to copy because they are made from two different metal alloys.

But last June police found a counterfeit press, producing fake £1 and £2 coins, in an East End warehouse.

The lead coins, dubbed crude copies, looked legitimate as they had been sprayed silver and gold, but would not be accepted in vending machines because they were magnetic.

A Morrisons spokesman wouldn't be more specific but said a 'number of stores in the West Midlands' were affected

The supermarket is now looking to refine its tills' technology so that only the right coins will be accepted

A spokesman for online coin dealer, 24carat.co.uk said: 'We don’t yet fully understand why counterfeiters would be turning to forging £2 coins when we would have thought it would be easier and more worthwhile to focus on £1 coins.

'The only reason we can think of is that it is becoming more widely known that many fake pound coins are in circulation, making them subject to greater scrutiny.'
