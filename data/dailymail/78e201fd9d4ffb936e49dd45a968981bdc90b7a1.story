Crystal Palace are interested in a January loan move for Arsenal striker ‎Yaya Sanogo.

Arsene Wenger is contemplating allowing Sanogo leave on a temporary basis to get more first team experience.

Palace boss Neil Warnock has made the capture of at least one centre-forward a January priority as he looks to add goals to his struggling side.

The France Under-21 striker has struggled to make an impact Wenger’s first-team plans, but the manager is confident Sanogo has what it take to become an Arsenal striker.

Palace are also interested in Stoke striker Peter Crouch, but the former England star looks set to sign a new deal with the Potters.

Warnock also wants a new left-back in January. His first choice was a loan move for Ashley Cole, but the club have been told he is not willing to leave Roma at the moment.

Palace are set to move for Lille’s Pape Souare after learning about Cole’s reluctance to quit Serie A after just six months.

Sanogo trains with the Arsenal first team at London Colney - but he may be going out on loan in January
