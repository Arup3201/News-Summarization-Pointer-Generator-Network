Click here for more from our brilliant Match Zone, including this graphic of Carlo Costly's opening goal for Honduras.

He is the lesser known Valencia but it is Enner and not Antonio who is making a name for himself in Brazil.

The 25-year-old sits joint top of the goalscoring charts following his match-winning double against Honduras in Curitiba.

There he resides alongside more illustrious names such as Thomas Muller, Karim Benzema, Robin van Persie and Arjen Robben.

But the muscular, pacey frontman – with an eye for goal to boot – might just be plying his trade in Europe as well next season should his World Cup scoring spree persist.

Currently on the books of Pachuca in Mexico, there has been talk of interest from abroad and such speculation is sure to amplify given his man-of-the-match performance to keep alive his nation’s hopes of progression to the knockout rounds.

Man-of-the-match: Enner Valencia

*Match ratings by Craig Hope

And Antonio Valencia, of Manchester United, might just deliver a glowing report when he returns to English shores of the team-mate who now has seven goals from 12 international caps and was on target during the 2-1 defeat to Switzerland in their group opener.

The marksman scored in either half to complete a come-from-behind victory and move Ecuador second in Group E behind France, who they face in Rio on Wednesday.

Both Ecuador and Honduras had drawn with England in pre-tournament friendlies in Miami and, to borrow horse-racing parlance, that form had hardly been franked by the subsequent performance of the Three Lions in Brazil.

But amid the blood, studs and thunder of a predictably feisty affair, there was also a healthy helping of Latin flair.

Ecuador were first to threaten when Jefferson Montero lashed a low ball across the face of goal and only the out-stretched gloves of Noel Valladares denied Felipe Caicedo a routine tap-in.

Honduras defender Victor Bernandez saw yellow after just six minutes for a wild swipe which felled Montero with the striker poised to level on goal.

Enner Valencia did manage to escape the cynical attention of the Honduran backline when scampering clear on 20 minutes but the forward snatched at the opportunity and lobbed wide.

The blonde-haired, black-bearded Bernandez was never far from the thick of the action and the centre-back should have opened the scoring on 27 minutes, somehow heading wide when unmarked and connecting with a corner-kick just eight yards from goal.

But it was Bernandez who turned provider for Costly to open the scoring just after the half-hour mark. His long punt downfield was misjudged by veteran Walter Ayovi and Costly made him pay, pouncing on the loose ball before drilling home in authoritative fashion from 18 yards.

It was Honduras’ first goal at the World Cup in 32 years and sparked belief that a maiden victory at the finals could be in the offing.

Their lead, however, was to last just three minutes and Valencia made it two for the tournament with a close-range stab after Juan Carlos Paredes’ shot was deflected into his path.

Bernandez sought to restore Honduras’ advantage and he stung the palms of Alex Dominguez with a fizzing free-kick in first-half injury-time.

There was still time for Costly to crack the post with a header before the break and strike partner Jerry Bengtson was booked when he followed up to bundle into the net with his arm.

Costly missed the finals four years ago because of injury and he bore the look of a man with some making up to do, the 31-year-old’s rising drive drawing a flying save from Dominguez within 30 seconds of the restart after half-time.

At the other end, Caicedo paid the price for his honesty when refusing to tumble under the clumsy challenge of a sliding Maynor Figueroa inside the area.

Sadly, Australian referee Benjamin Williams chose not to reward the former Manchester City frontman and the chance was gone.

But any injustice was soon forgotten when Valencia climbed to cushion Ayovi’s enticing free-kick into the bottom corner for his second of the night and third of the finals.

He was denied a hat-trick late on when Valladares repelled his curling free-kick, but his name had been noted nonetheless.
