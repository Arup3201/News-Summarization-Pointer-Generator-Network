Earlier this year, a digital guru released a viral video in a bid to sell his worn-out Holden Barina.

The blockbuster clip, titled Buy My Barina, amassed over one million views in a week. And with good reason: laden with sleek special effects, the clip cost over five times the value of the car.

Now, Sydney based David Johns has now made a sequel video titled Barinageddon, and it takes the blockbuster standards of its forerunner to a whole new level.

Sydney based David Johns has released a sequel to his viral video Buy My Barina

Barinageddon it takes the blockbuster standards of its forerunner to a whole new level

It tells the story of how a chance lightening bolt mutates the car into a rampant monster

After Buy My Barina garnered offers from all over the world, Mr Johns finally sold the car to NRMA in August, with all profits donated to Cancer Council Australia.

So begins the plot for the follow up video, titled Barinageddon.

Things kick off with a well-dressed Mr Johns handing the keys onto a lab coat clad NRMA scientist, who says he has some ‘very special plans for the car.’

An apprehensive Mr Johns asks: ‘She’ll be alright, wont she?’

‘We’re just going to run a few tests’ the scientist says with an assuring smile. ‘What could possibly go wrong?’

In one scene, the panicking scientist declares: ‘The barina has escaped! No one could have predicted this!’

The slick special effects throughout the clip far transcend those in the original video

Mr Johns told Daily Mail Australia the plot was inspired by factual events.

'When I dropped off the car at the NRMA their Research facility, they had some crazy equipment there. Hailguns, stuff to test the impact of dogs in a cars. That's where we hatched the concept of this clip,' he said.

'Then they offered the use of the facility for filming - how could we turn down an opportunity like that?'

During elaborate experiments with the car, a lightning bolt strikes the laboratory, shooting electrical volts into the blue Barina.

This freak accident mutates the car into something nobody could have predicted: a rampaging monster hell-bent on wiping humanity.

‘The barina has escaped!’ the panicking scientist says. ‘No one could have predicted this!’

David Johns, who is experienced in digital advertising, is planning to turn the trailer into a feature length film with a Kickstarter campaign

The car is then seen speeding around the city on the nightly news, with a reporter declaring ‘this little car is going to send us back to the stone age.’

The clip climaxes with the statement ‘It's like Armageddon...but with a Barina.’ 

The project is a collaboration between Mr Johns Chimney Group Asia-Pacific and the NRMA. 

Mr Johns says he was thrilled with the final result.

'Our 3D team in Poland did an amazing job . Have a great team of visual compositors here too that brought it all together.'

Now, he plans to turn the trailer into a feature length with a little help from a Kickstarter campaign. 

'I know it's an "out there" idea. But madder films have been made. If tornados can be full of sharks and snakes let loose on planes.. then why couldn't a mutated hatchback threaten humankind!'
