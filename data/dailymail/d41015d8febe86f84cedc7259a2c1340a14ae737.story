A Louisiana doctor says he was harassed by policemen while his wife was having an affair with a Texas police chief.

Dr Glen Hurlston of Vernon Parish, Louisiana is suing the city of Princeton, Texas along with former Police Chief Jeffery Barnett, and other officers of the Princeton Police Department.

According to a suit filed December 27, Dr Hurlston's wife Suzanne had an affair with Barnett for several years and even had his son, though she lied and said the boy was her husband's.

Dr Hurlston claims that Barnett, now the police chief of Kyle, Texas, used his position in Princeton to instruct other officers to conduct a 'campaign of harassment' against Dr Hurlston.

This campaign continued through January 1, 2012 when Princeton police officers arrested Dr Hurlston 'without substantial evidence' for domestic abuse battery.

That charge was later reduced to a minor misdemeanor after an investigation revealed that the arrest was performed in a 'slipshod and careless manner'.

Eventually Mrs Hurlston started dating someone new, a man named Gabriel Brow,

The harassment continued for a following year with the Princeton police officers threatening Dr Hurlston with further arrests if he called or texted his wife and her new boyfriend, Gabriel Brow. 

They said they would arrest him if he
 'showed his face' in Collin County, Texas, which he says made it hard 
for him to exercise his child visitation rights.

Since
 Dr Hurlston's arrest for domestic abuse, he says Mrs Hurlston has 
'waxed hot and cold' with him, staying with him as long as he provided 
money for a photography course in Paris, France.

Dr
 Hurlston, represented by attorney James B Doyle of Lake Charles, 
Louisiana, is seeking unspecified damages and attorney fees. 

According to the lawsuit, the Princeton police continue to harass Dr Hurlston even after the affair, threatening him with further arrests if he called or texted his wife and her boyfriend, Gabriel Brow (pictured above)
