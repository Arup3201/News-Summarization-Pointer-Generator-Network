 A fantasist who was jailed in 2003 for falsely claiming she was raped by Neil and Christine Hamilton is back behind bars for wrongly telling police her boyfriend had attacked her with a samurai sword.

Nadine Milroy-Sloan, 41, was sentenced to three years after wrongly claiming that the former MP and his wife had sexually assaulted her.

Now she has been jailed for four years for perverting the course of justice, after lying that her now ex-boyfriend had threatened to kill her at the home they shared in Rye, East Sussex.

He was arrested and later charged, spending three months on remand before police realised that she was lying.

Mrs Hamilton said she had been contacted by the man's mother following his arrest. Although Milroy-Sloan was using her maiden name Checksfield and the first name Emily, she had suspected it was the same woman who had wrongly accused the couple in 2001.

'This poor guy was on remand for three months on totally trumped up charges,' Mrs Hamilton told MailOnline.

'Thank goodness he had the resolution to follow it through because there is a big cost, not just in terms of money but time, and he was determined that she was not going to get away with it.'

Falsely accused: Milroy-Sloan had made up the allegations against the couple

In June 2003, Nadine Milroy-Sloan was jailed for three years for falsely accusing Tory MP Neil Hamilton and his wife Christine Hamilton of rape.

Milroy-Sloan, then 29, was convicted by a jury at the Old Bailey of two charges of perverting the course of justice, having lied to police in May 2001, claiming she had been attacked by former Tory minister Mr Hamilton and his wife in a flat in Ilford, Essex.

She claimed she had been lured to the flat by 62-year-old Barry Lehaney, who she said had told her he was the Hamiltons' chauffeur.

But Milroy-Sloan had never met the couple and invented the story to make money. Just two days before the alleged attack, she had been to see publicist Max Clifford with a story about the Hamiltons being involved in a vice ring and a tax scam.

Following their arrest on August 10, 2001, the couple mounted a very public defence against the allegations, and said they were not at the alleged scene because they were hosting a dinner party, producing alibis from guests including former Conservative speechwriter and Big Brother contestant Derek Laud.

The investigation against the couple was dropped when it became apparent that the accusations were entirely false.

The jury of ten men and two women agreed with the prosecution that Milroy-Sloan, of Peterhouse Road, Grimsby, Lincs, was a 'cunning' fantasist who had come up with the scheme to find fame and fortune. 

The jury heard that shamed publicist Clifford, who was jailed earlier this year for a string of sex charges, told Milroy-Sloan she could expect around £100,000 from the media if she could prove her vice ring claims.

Prosecutor Orlando Pownall QC said the Hamiltons were totally innocent and had been at Claridges Hotel on the night of the alleged rape.

Milroy-Sloan's claims led to Mr Lehaney being arrested on May 7 and the Hamiltons being detained on August 10 'in a blaze of wholly unwarranted publicity'.

Mr Pownall also told the court that Milroy-Sloan had been paid £50,000 by a Sunday newspaper to reveal her identity.

The rape allegation was not the first time Milroy-Sloan made false complaints to the police.

In 1997, she was convicted of a breach of the peace after attacking a friend. Six weeks later, she told police the woman had since attacked her in the street.

Her mother-in-law Karen Sloan said she had also told police that her elderly, terminally-ill mother was a drug dealer who had hit her.

Clifford, jailed for sexually assaulting a string of women earlier this year, later agreed to pay undisclosed damages and costs over comments he made to newspapers and to GMTV on the false allegations against the Hamiltons.

Weeks after he was charged, the man had recorded a conversation with Milroy-Sloan, in which she admitted that the allegation made in April 2012 was false.

She then tried to get police to withdraw the allegations, and the charges against him were dropped.

Milroy-Sloan, of Deal, Kent, was jailed last week after she was found guilty of perverting the course of justice. She was cleared of a separate alleged offence of burglary.

Police confirmed to MailOnline that Nadine Milroy-Sloan and Emily Checksfield were the same person. 

Detective Chief Inspector Mark Ling said; 'Checksfield had put this man through the ordeal of a convincing allegation, arrest, charge, initial court appearance and, for a while, a remand in custody until he secured bail.

Anger: Mrs Hamilton, pictured earlier this year with her husband, described Milroy-Sloan as 'mad, bad and dangerous to know', and said she had 'devastated' her ex-boyfriend's life

'We will always take all allegations of violent offences very seriously, and this one was thoroughly investigated, but it became clear that Checksfield had made the allegation out of personal spite and that it had no foundation.

'It is equally important that false allegations are considered for prosecution and we worked closely with the CPS to help ensure that she was eventually brought to justice.'

In August 2001, Former Conservative MP for Tatton, Cheshire, Mr Hamilton, 65, and his wife, 64, were arrested after Milroy-Sloan claimed she had been attacked by them at a flat in Ilford, Essex.

She claimed she had been lured to the flat by a man who had told her he was the Hamiltons' chauffeur.

But Milroy-Sloan, who already had a criminal record, had never met the couple and had invented the story to make money.

Two days before the alleged attack, she went to see publicist Max Clifford with a story about the Hamiltons being involved in a vice ring and a tax scam. 

The jury of ten men and two women agreed with the prosecution that Milroy-Sloan was a 'cunning' fantasist who had come up with the scheme to find fame and fortune.

The Hamiltons were arrested and questioned for five hours in August 2001. But it emerged they had never met Milroy-Sloan or been near Ilford at the time of the alleged offence.

''It's a scandal,' said Mrs Hamilton today.

She added: 'I know she didn't accuse him of rape, but she did in our case, and what she did to this poor guy was appalling.

'He real crime is against genuine  victims because every time someone cries wolf it makes it harder for them to be believed. It's a crime against women.

'She is thoroughly mad, bad, and dangerous to know and thank God she has not got away with it.

'She has devastated this fellow's life and it's terrible. Let's hope she is not allowed to do this to anyone else again.' 

 A Sussex Police spokesman said: 'The allegation made by Checksfield against her then-partner in Rye in 2012 was thoroughly investigated and the facts, including her previous conviction in 2003, were submitted to the CPS who authorised his prosecution.'
