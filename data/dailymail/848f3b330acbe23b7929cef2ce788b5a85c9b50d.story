Comatose former F1 
ace Michael Schumacher is showing signs of improvement which have 
brought 'great joy' to his family, his old racing rival Jean Alesi says.

French
 driver Alesi, 49, spoke after visiting Schumacher at the hospital in 
Grenoble, France, where he has been in an induced coma for three months.

He said his F1 contemporary appeared to be getting better, but seemed a long way from recovery.

'During my recent visit I
 noticed that something has improved. I have felt in the family a 
relief, a great joy about how things are developing,' he told German 
motorsport magazine Speedweek.

'This is great, even if the path back to life is still very long.'

Schumacher,
 45, suffered a near-fatal head injury in an accident while skiing with 
his son in the Alpine resort of Meribel on December 29.

It is not the first time that Alesi has been to see Schumacher, an F1 legend with seven championships and 91 wins to his name.

Alesi
 said of his earlier visits: 'First of all, Michael responded only to 
pain, so if you have pinched him for example. But this can also be an 
unconscious reaction of the body.'

New hope: Schumacher's manager last week said the F1 driver has shown 'encouraging signs' of improvement

The Italian former race driver's 
comments were the second piece of good news about Schumacher's condition
 in a week, after the German's manager Sabine Kehm announced he was 
showing 'moments of consciousness'.

'Michael is making progress on his way,' she said. 'He shows moments of consciousness and awakening.

'We
 are on his side during his long and difficult fight, together with the 
team of the hospital in Grenoble, and we keep remaining confident.'

Speaking
 last Friday, she added that no further details would be given out of 
respect to his family and to 'enable the medical team to work in full 
calmness'.

Gary Hartstein, a former Formula One doctor, said 'awakening' would mean that Schumacher has opened his eyes.

He
 said: 'This eye opening can even be cyclic, following what looks just 
like a sleep-wake cycle (even if not synchronised to real day-night 
hours).'

And he said the 'moments of consciousness' meant that Schumacher would have had interaction with his environment.

He
 said: 'It consists of episodes of clear, purposeful interaction with 
the environment, and/or clear signs of awareness of self, even if these 
signs are not constantly present.

'For
 example, if Michael smiles when a member of his entourage talks to him -
 reproducibly and consistently on at least a few occasions. Or following
 people with his eyes.

'Or trying to communicate, or obeying simple 
commands. Any of this constitutes objective signs of contact between the
 "outside" and the "inside". This then would be a minimally conscious 
state. And that is about the best news we could possibly get right now.'

Despite the continuing 
encouraging signs, the prognosis is that Schumacher will not be moved 
from Grenoble Hospital anytime soon.

His
 family and friends have also stressed there is no truth in wild rumours
 that his wife Corinna 'has built or plans to build any kind of medical 
suite for Michael on any of the buildings on their land in Gland, 
Switzerland. This includes future buildings'.

When doctors give the go-ahead he will be moved to a rehabilitation clinic, according to a family friend.

The friend said: 'There will be a very significant amount of rehab required.'

Keen skier: Thrill-seeker Schumacher had been a keen and skilled skier before his accident in December

Waiting: The Grenoble University Hospital, where Schumacher has been in an induced coma for three months

Loving support: Corinna arrives at the hospital to which she and family make a daily 150-mile round trip

It
 will be 15 weeks ago on Sunday that Schumacher, 45, suffered his 
life-threatening accident while skiing in Meribel, where he owns a 
chalet. Doctors began the process of gradually awakening him more than nine weeks ago.

Ms
 Kehm said it is 'very hard' for his loved ones to comprehend how the 
racing car driver could have been so catastrophically injured in such a 
'banal situation'.

The accident occurred just over 14 feet from the edge of the ski run in an off-piste area in the French resort of Meribel.

He
 was skiing with his 14-year-old son when he lost control after hitting a
 rock. He ended up smashing his head into a bolder 34 feet further down 
the mountain.

He is receiving round-the-clock care in intensive care in Grenoble University Hospital.

Corinna, with whom he has two children Gina Marie, 16, and Mick, 14, has remained at his bedside.

His family have remained confident throughout the tragedy that Schumacher will recover.

A
 statement released last month said: 'We are and remain confident that 
Michael will pull through and will wake up. There sometimes are small, 
encouraging signs, but we also know that this is the time to be very 
patient.'

His manager has 
stood by this statement during the last few weeks amidst the negativity 
offered by certain doctors who have nothing to do with his treatment.

In February French investigators closed the official inquiry into his accident, ruling out any criminal wrongdoing.
