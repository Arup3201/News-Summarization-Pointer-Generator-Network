A new street gang known as 'Bachems 420' whose members align themselves with Islamic militant group Hezbollah is believed to be behind a western Sydney brawl which left one of its teenage members fighting for his life over the weekend.

A 17-year-old male, who goes by the name 'Sayed Fourtwozero' on social media, was stabbed in the chest during a brawl at an out-of-control party in Merrylands on Friday night and was taken to hospital in critical condition.

He self-discharged and left hospital on Monday night, a Westmead Hospital spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia.

Riot police and the dog squad descended the brawl at Merrylands Oval, near a hall where a birthday party held for two teenagers was gatecrashed by carloads of youths armed with knives.

The Facebook page of the stabbing victim, who is a member of Bachems 420, shows him describing himself as a Shia soldier, posing with a police baton and posting quotes from Hezbollah commanders.

Another member, who also uses 'Four Two Zero' in his name on social media, posted a tribute to his injured friend on Facebook in the form of a 'Bachems 420' flag - featuring a logo and an AK-47 rifle superimposed over the Afghan flag.

Another member from Lidcombe, who also uses the moniker 'Fourtwozero' and whose cover photo is a hand-drawn Bachems 420 flag, posted a get well message following the brawl.

'Soljah on brother hope u get better Sayed Fourtwozero,' he said.

The '420' term is a number used in Afghanistan to describe someone who is 'dangerous and dishonest', The Daily Telegraph reported, while 'Bachem' means 'son' in the Afghan language of Dari. '420' is also slang for the regular use of marijuana.

Inspector Adam Phillips told AAP Friday's brawl involved up to 60 males.

A police officer was hit on the arm with a bottle while trying to break up the fight, and was treated in hospital.

The mother whose teenager's birthday celebrations were crashed told Channel 10 carloads of youths armed with knives arrived at the party on Friday, and she tried in vain to keep them out.

'They came up to the gate, I told him to leave and basically he just told me to eff off, and he grabbed onto the fence and just started screaming stuff,' the woman told the network.

'So I dialled triple-0 and rang the police.'
