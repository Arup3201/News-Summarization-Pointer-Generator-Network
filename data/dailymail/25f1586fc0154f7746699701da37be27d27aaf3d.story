UberX driver Gerald Montgomery, 51, allegedly took a passenger to the airport and then returned to her Denver home to try and break in 

An UberX driver was arrested after he allegedly took a passenger to the airport and then returned to her Denver home to try and break in.

Gerald Montgomery, 51, went to the woman's home after driving her to Denver International Airport and attempted to get in through the back door, according to a police spokesman.

Police said Montgomery fled when the unidentified woman's roommate, who was inside the house, noticed him. 

The woman sent her roommate the Uber receipt, which featured Montgomery's photograph. 

Her roommate then posted the receipt on her Facebook page with a message to warn her friends. 

'I had just gotten home when he was about to get in the back door,' she wrote, according to Fox 31. 

'He probably thought no one else was here. Friends that take Uber, please be careful.' 

Police were able to identify Montgomery after seeing the receipt  and took him into custody at Jefferson County jail on suspicion of attempted second-degree burglary.

Uber officials said they have contacted the passenger and refunded her ride, which cost $39.88. 

A spokesperson for the company said they also immediately deactivated Montgomery's 'access to the platform', according to the Denver Post. 

The company added that Montgomery had passed all criminal and driving history background checks before he was allowed to become a driver for the popular app. 

But, at least for his last passenger, that's not enough to make her feel safe. 

She told Fox 31 she would never use Uber again, even if it meant having to pay $90 to take a cab home from the airport.
