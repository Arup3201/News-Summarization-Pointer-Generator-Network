A three-time U.S. Olympian who was publicity exposed on Thursday as an elite $600-an-hour escort has revealed that her husband knew about her double life and tried to put an end to it.

Suzy
 Favor-Hamilton, a 44-year-old married mother of three, has been working 
with one of Las Vegas' top agencies to book 'dates' across cities 
including Las Vegas, Chicago and Houston.

Despite
 using the name 'Kelly Lundy' as she advertised her services through 
Haley Heston's Private Collection, her double life has been revealed 
after she told clients about her real identity, believing there was an 
unwritten rule they would not speak out.

Double-life: Suzy Favor-Hamilton, a three-time U.S. Olympian, has reportedly been working as an escort at cities throughout the country for a year. Right, she runs in the 1,500 meters at the 2000 Sydney Olympics

Showing her assets: On her escort profile, Favor-Hamilton explained that discretion was extremely important to her and would blur her fave as a result, but that didn't stop her from showing off her body

Expensive taste: She wrote on her profile that she likes Herve Leger dresses, Christian Louboutin shoes, and Agent Provocateur shoes

But now at least one of these clients has contacted The Smoking Gun, which in turn has revealed the details of Favor-Hamilton's clandestine career, which she now calls a 'huge mistake.'

Soon after the story appeared online,
 instantly sparking a furor in the media, Favor-Hamilton took to Twitter
 to offer her 3,183 followers her side of the story.

In one missive, the 44-year-old 
mother explained that she was initially drawn to escorting 
‘because it provided many coping mechanisms for me when I was going 
through a very challenging time with my marriage and my life.

‘It provided an escape from a life that I was struggling in. It was a double life,’ she wrote.

Going public: Favor-Hamilton took to Twitter, writing a series of posts in which she revealed that her husband knew about her double life, and that her decision to become an escort was fueled by depression

In another, Favor-Hamilton wrote that 
the reasons behind her decision to turn to a life of prostitution, while
 seemingly irrational now, ‘made sense at the time’ and were closely 
related to depression. 

‘As crazy as I know it seems, I never 
thought I would be exposed, therefore never hurting anybody,’ she said 
in one Twitter post.

The Olympian has refused to be 
labelled a victim, insisting that she knew what she was doing and taking
 full responsibility for her actions.

She told The Smoking Gun that her 
husband was the only one who knew about her moonlighting as a prostitute
 in cities across the country.

Profile: She reportedly worked under the name 'Kylie' and uploaded provocative pictures (as seen) to her profile on an escort agency website. The profile claims she is bisexual and charges $600 an hour

‘He tried, he tried to get me to stop. He wasn't supportive of this at all,’ Favor Hamilton noted.

The 44-year-old has revealed that she is currently seeking psychological help for her problem.

‘I fully intend to make amends and get
 back to being a good mother, wife, daughter, and friend,’ she concluded
 in her most recent post.

Favor-Hamilton entered the public eye competing as a middle distance runner in the 1992, 1996, and 2000 Olympics. She went on to record a Nike TV advert, a swimsuit calendar and carry out Disney promo work.

She now works as a motivational speaker and runs a successful realty company in Madison, Wisconsin with her husband Mark, whom she met at college. They have a seven-year-old daughter.

But last December, she began working 
with Haley Heston's agency to escape this routine life, she told the 
Smoking Gun when it caught up with her.

It is not clear how she was 
introduced to the agency, but she wrote on the website: 'I met Haley 
with the idea of fulfilling a fantasy and only doing it for the short 
term.

Betrayal: Favor-Hamilton is married to her college sweetheart, Mark, who tried to make her stop the escort work, she said. They also have a seven-year-old daughter together, right

'Well, after my first date, I was 
hooked, and have been doing my best to visit Las Vegas as often as my 
schedule allows (I run my own business in my real world life).'

She featured in numerous provocative 
photographs on her online profile on the website - yet always had her 
face obscured or hidden from the camera.

She explained: 'Discretion 
is EXTREMELY important to me, hence you will only see blurred photos of
 my face on this site. I know this is not ideal, but I hope you 
understand that it is essential for me.'

Favor
 Hamilton also described herself on the profile - which has now been 
removed - as a 'workout fanatic' who enjoyed skiing, biking, hiking, 
running marathons and traveling.

She wrote that she was bisexual so happy to carry out services with couples.

'Working with couples requires special 
skill and I pride myself in my ability to make a woman feel comfortable 
and not threatened in any way,' she wrote. 'A date with me will NEVER 
feel rushed.'

She listed her rates as $600 for an hour, $1,000 for two hours, $4,000 for 12 hours and $6,000 for 24 hours, according to the page seen by the Smoking Gun.

And clients are happy with her services, allowing her to be named as The Erotic Review's third-ranked 'provider' in Las Vegas earlier this month.

In one July 2012 review, a client 
wrote: 'She is worth every penny. I will go bankrupt before I stop 
seeing her. I hope no one else goes to see her, because I want her all 
to myself.'

Prostitution is illegal in all of the
 cities where Favor-Hamilton has had 'dates' arranged by Haley Heston. But she said that she had never considered the legal ramifications of her 
work.

Tumble: At the Sydney Olympics in 2000, she famously fell during the 1500m final, losing out on a medal

Loss: She said she became frustrated during the race that she could not win a medal in her brother's memory. Her brother Dan, pictured, committed suicide the year before the 2000 Olympics

As well as legal problems, she may also 
face a backlash from her other employers if they learn that she 
apparently fitted the 'dates' around her demanding work schedule.

Comfortable life: She now works at a realty firm with her husband, Mark

At the end of August, Haley Heston said 'Kelly' would
 be able to work in Orange County California. On 
September 1, she appeared at the Disney Exhibit Hall to speak to runners
 ahead of the Disneyland Half Marathon the next day, which she ran with her husband.

And in another example, the service 
said she would be in Vegas between November 29 and December 5. She ran 
the December 2 Rock n' Roll Marathon along the Strip.

After being tracked down to a hotel in Las Vegas, Favor Hamilton eventually admitted she was 'Kelly', and while she called the role 'exciting' she acknowledged she had made an error in judgment.

'I take full responsibility for my 
mistakes,' she said, the Smoking Gun reported. 'I'm not the victim and I'm not going that route. I'm owning up to what I did. I would not blame anybody 
except myself.'

She added: 'Everybody in this world makes mistakes. I 
made a huge mistake. Huge.'

On Thursday, she tweeted: 'I do not expect people to understand, but the reasons for doing this made sense to me at the time and were very much related to depression.

'I cannot emphasize enough how sorry I am to anyone I have hurt as a result of my actions and greatly appreciate the support from family and those closest to me. I fully intend to make amends and get back to being a good mother, wife, daughter, and friend.'

She said that she had not second 
guessed telling clients about her real identity and called herself 'too 
trusting'. She said she expected all clients to honor a silence code.

Of the client Favor Hamilton suspected of going to the media, she said: 'He totally broke all the 
rules by outing me.'

But she explained that she would not be revealing his identity to his loved ones as: 'I don’t want to be like him. Because he is scum. And I will not 
become scum to make myself feel good.'

The
 revelation will come as no shock to her husband, who already knows of 
her side-career, she said. He repeatedly tried to make her stop, but she
 had refused.

She added that she had recently started therapy to come to terms with what she had done.

New life: She now works as a motivational speaker and carries out promo work for Disney

The couple does not appear to be suffering any financial hardship, according to court and municipal records.

But she has spoken of struggles in the past, including how she suffered from 
postpartum depression after her daughter's birth in 2005.

Her brother Dan also killed himself in 1999 and, when she ran in the 1500-meter final at the Sydney Olympics the following year, she purposefully fell when runners overtook her as she was ashamed she could not win the medal in his memory.
