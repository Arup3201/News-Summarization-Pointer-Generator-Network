Letters delivered by land, sea, air and even horse and cart.

A new set of historic images gives a glimpse of life inside the postal system spanning 50 years.

The Post Office In Pictures collection of black and white photographs reveals the different ways letters have been delivered.

The collection of historic images has been released by The British Postal Museum to give a glimpse of live behind the scenes of the postal service spanning an 80-year period

The series of black and white images give an insight into the many different ways letters and packages made it from sender to their destination from 1930 to 1980, including by aeroplane

And they hark back to a time when it dead game birds could be posted with just a stamp attached around the neck.

The British Postal Museum and Archive has released the fascinating series dating from 1930 to 1980 as part of a travelling exhibition.

The original pictures show how deliveries were made by land, sea and air and offer a fascinating look at the life of a postie while capturing an important snapshot of British history.

It provides an insight into the lives of postmen collecting boxes of fish for delivery from the Supreme Bloater shop in Great Yarmouth.

The Post Office made regular deliveries of herrings from the Norfolk seaside town, with a huge surge in orders during the 'harvest of herrings' from October to December.

It required the postal service to deploy special collection vans to pick up the vast number of boxes of fish being send as gifts across the country.

And the posties also helped collect and deliver telegrams detailing the prices and quality of the fish available for buyers.

During the height of the fish harvest, the Royal Mail would see a fourfold increase in telegrams and mail sent and received by the temporary workers harvesting the fish increased the workload for postal workers.

Similarly the flower industry had a profound impact on the postal service, reaching a peak in early Spring, notably on the Isles of Sciliy.

At that time of year the vast majority of letters sent in the area would be related to the cut bloom industry, and most parcels sent contained a range of stunning flowers ranging from daffodils to violets and tulips.

They were sent across the UK to markets including Covent Garden in London for sale to the public.

In 1934 the Post Office established its 
first public relations department. The department's aim was to promote 
the image of the postal service and it was then that photography became 
so important.

The collection is a tribute to the dedication of postmen and women over an 80-year period and the challenges they faced, making sure the people of the UK received their mail, on time and in one piece.

The pictures will be displayed at the Gainsborough Heritage Centre in 
Lincolnshire until January 3. The collection will then move to the 
Aberystwyth  Arts Centre in Wales from January 18 to March 8.
