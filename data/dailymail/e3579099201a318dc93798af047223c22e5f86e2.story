A benefits cheat who claimed to be wheelchair-bound is facing a hefty jail sentence after swindling £1.5m to fund a luxury lifestyle, including scuba diving holidays and a high-powered motorbike.

Barry Brooks, 49, who claimed he was unable to climb stairs, had to use an electric wheelchair and could not lift anything heavier than a sandwich, set up a business aimed at helping get disabled people into work entitling him to receive grants.

He then siphoned off cash into his own accounts.

The self-styled ‘Knight’, who insisted on being called ‘Sir Barry’, stole hundreds of thousands of pounds for himself in claims put through the fake business for taxis to the office and support.

'Sir Barry': Brooks, 49, claimed he was unable to climb stairs, had to use an electric wheelchair and could not lift anything heavier than a sandwich yet was able to play in a swimming pool while holidaying in Gran Canaria

Devious: Brooks set up a business aimed at helping get disabled people into work entitling him to receive grants. He then siphoned off cash into his own accounts

Disability claims made on behalf of other ‘employees’ meant that £1million worth of grants went to the company, making the scam amount to £1.5m

The monthly claims on behalf of the company were submitted by Derek Arnold, 55, named as a co-director of the company and who described himself as Brooks’s 'sexual playmate'.

Brooks, of Bromley, south east London, was put under surveillance at the end of 2009 and a search of the Bromley house he shared with Arnold revealed photographs of the pair on holiday together.

Photographs included Brooks diving 
around a wreck in Gran Canaria, playing ball games in a swimming pool 
and driving a high-powered Suzuki motorcycle. He even ran his own 
motorcycle shop.

Taxi 
receipts along with an extensive range of wine and other alcohol, a 
newly fitted kitchen and evidence of a gym membership indicating the 
pair were living in ‘comfort’ were also found.

Brooks
claimed he would wear a support called a reciprocating gait orthosis, 
which enabled him to walk, but nothing of the sort was found at his 
home.

He also claimed he 
had a specially adapted motorcycle suit which enabled him to wear the 
contraption underneath, but that he could not get on and off the bike 
himself.

The court heard that Dr Michael 
Gross, a consultant neurologist called as an expert witness for the 
prosecution, had reached the conclusion that Brooks 'was elaborating his
circumstances to convince or deceive, otherwise known in medical terms 
as malingering.

'It is impossible to come to any conclusion other than that there is an elaboration to deceive,' he said.

The court heard prosecutor Andrew Marshall turn to Brooks and say: 'Arise Sir Barry'. 

Brooks
and his co-defendants were involved in setting up the ‘Access Audit 
Corporation’ (AAC), in 2004 to provide training and advice services to 
disabled people, but found a way to defraud the access to work programme
- funded by the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP).

Lies: There were also photographs of him riding a powerful Suzuki motorbike unaided

Able bodied: Brooks claimed he would wear a support called a reciprocating gait orthosis which enabled him to walk, but nothing of the sort was found at his home

Once a disabled person finds work, they may need grants to assist them in getting to work, travel whilst at work and support - and monthly claims were submitted on behalf of AAC and Brooks himself.

Mr Marshall, prosecuting, said: 'What the evidence has revealed is a wholesale assault on a part of the benefit system that was designed to assist some of the more vulnerable members of our society.'

It is not just the figures that are surprising, he said, 'but the audacity, the confidence and the cynicism with which this was done over a very long time'.

He said Brooks had an ‘extremely persuasive and charismatic personality’ and still had supporters who saw no wrong in him despite the overwhelming evidence against him.

Southwark Crown Court heard he even managed to dupe medical professionals to advance his fraudulent claims.

Simon Clements, Head of Welfare, Health and Rural Prosecutions at the CPS said: 'Barry Brooks and his associates claimed
to run a business that would help people with disabilities get back to 
work. Today, that business was confirmed as a complete sham.

'From the outset, Brooks himself 
exaggerated very minor injuries to falsely claim £1.2m through the 
government's Access to Work scheme.

'Despite his claims that he could not
walk unaided and was forced to live on the ground floor of his home, 
Brooks had gym membership, was an active advanced scuba diver, and 
holiday snaps show him jumping energetically into a swimming pool.'

They
had surveillance going back to 2010 showing Brooks walking, shopping 
and driving unaided, he said, and towards the end of 2011 there is also 
evidence he was actively managing a pub.

He continued: 'He has been a very active scuba diver, reaching advanced diver status...This is a clear sham. He was physically able to carry out all these activities but at the same time was purporting to be severely disabled in order to make these claims.'

Brooks along with Arnold were found guilty of conspiracy to defraud.

Brooks was found 
guilty of obtaining a living allowance dishonestly by 
stating he was dependent on his children for lifting and carrying on a 
form dated May 30, 2009.

Both men will be sentenced at a later date.

Judge Beddoe said he expected Brooks, who spent the entire trial in a wheelchair, to be standing when he sentenced him.

Arnold was also convicted on a charge of making a false 
representation in order to obtain benefit.

Co-defendants Robert Harris, 55, and John White, 78, were cleared of conspiracy to defraud.

It
can also now be revealed that Arnold may face further criminal charges 
after being linked to a blog apparently accusing the trial judge of 
corruption.

Arnold is 
thought to be the behind a series of postings uploaded to the internet 
under the title 'Diogenese Associates' in which repeated references have
been made to his trial.

One
posting uploaded on July 15, which has now been removed from the 
internet, showed a picture of Judge Beddoe next to the heading 
'Corruption at Southwark Crown Court number 8?'.

The
article states at one point: 'One imagines and hopes that if we're 
every [sic] brought to trial that we'll be assured of a fair hearing and
that our voice will be heard - this isn't necessarily the case 
however.'

It goes on to list a series of pieces
of 'evidence' said to have been withheld from jurors trying the case in
what it describes as a bid to 'to prevent justice; to allow the 
prosecution to hold the upper hand and to ensure that the defence is at a
disadvantage'.

The 
blog concludes by saying: 'Justice be damned, it's face-saving and 
cost-saving that counts here; hiding prosecution and CPS mistakes is 
what counts.'

After 
hearing of the blog Judge Beddoe remanded Arnold in custody for the 
remainder of the trial saying it was necessary to 'take a preventative 
measure which may prevent further publication of this kind'.

Several
other posts, not mentioned in court but still online, also refer to the
case. One, from July 15, entitled 'Careful, there's more of them - out 
of the wheelchair and onto the bike' discusses disabled motorcyclists.

It
finishes by saying 'Bl***y good job and more power to you all guys! 
Maybe you should ride along to Southwark Crown Court and let the powers 
that be understand that being disabled doesn't mean you should not have a
life'.
