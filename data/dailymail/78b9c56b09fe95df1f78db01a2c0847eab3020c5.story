David Rennison is from the Royal British Legion in Chapeltown, South Yorkshire,  where members were left 'shocked' and 'upset' after a collector was turned away from their local Asda store.

Asda bosses forced a British Legion poppy seller to leave their store - because it clashed with the rota of other charity collectors.

The shocked collector was unexpectedly marched from the  supermarket in Chapeltown, South Yorkshire, and told not to return for a week. 

David Roussell, local Legion secretary, said: 'We were shocked a poppy seller had been turned away and she was upset at being asked to leave the store. 

'We always collect at the Asda store for two weeks, so not allowing us to collect there for one of those weeks could affect our collection total.

'We send letters to supermarkets around July letting them know we intend to collect, and someone went and agreed it verbally at the Asda store,' said Mr Rousell.

Collector Jacqueline Stenton was representing the British Legion at the supermarket when she was unexpectedly turned away on October 25.

Asda managers said they couldn't allow a poppy seller that week because it clashed with a calendar of other charity collectors who stand outside the store. 

Mr Roussell said the store had always allowed poppy sellers in the past and collectors had not had any trouble until Ms Stenton was turned away.

An Asda spokesman confirmed its stores have a calendar of charity activity to avoid clashes.

'Across October our stores fundraise for Breast Cancer Awareness month, and there were also two local charities collecting in store at this time.

'As per every year the Royal British Legion is welcomed into our stores from November 1 to 11. We're pleased the team has been in store since Saturday.'
