A millionaire socialite who is on trial for force-feeding her autistic son a fatal dose of drugs emailed her financial adviser as she watched him die, a court heard yesterday.

Gigi Jordan, 54, forced a cocktail of crushed pills and orange juice down the throat of eight-year-old Jude Mirra in a $2,300-a-night suite at Manhattan's exclusive Peninsula hotel.

As he lay dying on the bed next to her, she then reportedly emailed adviser Patrick Walsh, saying: 'Hi Pat, can you please wire $125,000 to Bruce as requested below?'.

Standing trial: As Jude (right) lay dying on the bed next to her, Jordan (pictured, left, in court) then reportedly emailed adviser Patrick Walsh, saying: 'Hi Pat, can you please wire $125,000 to Bruce as requested below?'

She hoped to siphon the large sum of cash from her son's trust fund into one of her business accounts, prosecutors said.

Although Jordan has never disputed feeding the fatal drugs to Jude, she has described her actions in the luxury hotel room on Fifth Avenue in February 2010 as a 'mercy killing'.

However, prosecutors said the pharmaceutical executive's emails contradicted her defense lawyer's assertions that she was 'emotionally distraught' at her son's autism.

Instead, Jordan wanted to live the life of the socialite and not be tied down by a young son who required so much attention because of his condition, said lead prosecutor Matthew Bogdanos.

Aim: Jordan hoped to siphon cash from her son's trust into one of her business accounts, prosecutors said

During yesterday's trial, Mr Walsh claimed that Jordan was a demanding, high-maintenance client who often made 'unreasonable' requests, according to the New York Post. 

'My job was to deal with that, but most requests she would make I think would be considered unreasonable,' he told the court. 

When asked about the times Jordan reportedly transferred money from her son's account into her own, Mr Walsh replied: 'If she wanted to use it for her own personal use, we would not stop her from doing that.'

Jordan currently has a pending civil suit against the financial adviser, whom she claims helped her ex-husband steal millions of dollars from her.

Allegations: In addition to his medical condition, Jordan alleges that her son's (pictured) biological father, and her second husband, Emil Tzekov, had been sexually abusing the boy since he was an infant

During an earlier hearing, the court heard that Jordan had also balanced her checkbook after forcing the lethal concoction of pills down her son's throat.

'Ms. Jordan is so distraught, so emotional, so emotionally disturbed that she balances her checkbook in that room on her bed with her dead child only a few feet away,' Mr Bogdanos told jurors.

The mother then reportedly attempted to take her own life by consuming a mixture of pills and Grey Goose vodka.

But she was foiled when members of law enforcement kicked down the door to the room and found her on the floor incoherent and babbling.

She immediately said to one officer, 'I want a lawyer', the court heard.  

In his opening statement, Allan Brenner, defending, said Jordan was a caring, loving and devoted mother who was terrified of the suffering her son was going through.

In addition to his medical condition, Jordan alleges that her son's biological father, and her second husband, Emil Tzekov, had been sexually abusing the boy since he was an infant.

She also claims that her first husband, Ray Mirra, had threatened to murder her and the boy if she turned him in to authorities for selling black market prescription drugs.

Neither Tzekov, who has strongly denied the allegations, nor Mirra have ever been charged with a crime.  

Mr Brenner plans to argue that Jordan killed her son while in the grip of an extreme emotional disturbance, which would allow the jury to convict her of manslaughter rather than murder.

Killing a person to save them from future abuse has never been a recognized defense to murder in the state of New York. 

Jordan, who according to the New York Times has gone through 11 defense lawyers since she was charged over four years ago, faces up to life in prison if convicted.

The trial is expected to last until November.
