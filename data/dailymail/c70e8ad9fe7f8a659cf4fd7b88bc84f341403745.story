US aviation officials have banned all American airlines from Syrian airspace in a notice that cites the threat of armed extremist groups who are equipped with anti-aircraft weapons.

The Federal Aviation Administration had previously warned against flying in airspace over the war-torn country in the Middle East, but had not prohibited them.

In an updated notice, the aviation authority said the change was based on updated assessment of risk and the lack of requests from carriers wishing to fly over Syria amid the unrest.

The FAA has banned all US airlines from flying over Syria due to the ongoing armed conflict

The notice reads: ‘The ongoing armed conflict and volatile security environment in Syria poses a serious potential threat to civil aviation.

‘Armed extremist groups in Syria are known to be equipped with a variety of anti-aircraft weapons which have the capability to threaten civilian aircraft. 

‘Opposition groups have successfully shot down Syrian military aircraft using these anti-aircraft weapon systems during the course of the conflict.’

The notice also cites previous threats from opposition groups, who have warned airlines to avoid flying into Syria.

The FAA said: ‘Due to the presence of anti-aircraft weapons among the extremist groups and ongoing fighting in various locations throughout Syria, there is a continuing significant potential threat to civil aviation operating in Syrian airspace.’

The UK Civil Aviation Authority has issued its own warning about the dangers of flying within or near Syrian airspace, but it has not implemented a ban.

Very few airlines continue to fly over Syria. Data from FlightRadar24, a flight-tracking website, showed a handful of Syrian Air and Middle East Airlines flights operating regularly this month.

In July, Malaysia Airlines faced criticism after it rerouted a flight over the country, just days after one of its planes was downed by a ground-to-air missile in eastern Ukraine.

The FAA’s order was released as Small Arms Survey, an international research group that tracks the global flow of weapons, released a report that says armed groups in Syria have several hundred portable anti-aircraft missiles in their arsenal.

The missiles could be used to destroy low-flying commercial planes, the report warns.

Many airlines have already been avoiding airspace over conflict zones in Syria, Iraq and Ukraine.

Carriers have been taking greater care since Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 was shot down over the conflict zone in Ukraine last month. All 298 people aboard the passenger jet were killed.

Earlier this month, the FAA barred US airlines from flying over Iraq as the armed conflict there intensified and the US launched airstrikes targeting militants belonging to the Islamic State.
