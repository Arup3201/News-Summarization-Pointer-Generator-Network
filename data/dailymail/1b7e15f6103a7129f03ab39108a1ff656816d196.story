Sandbags are stacked high outside Buckingham Palace but the building has been left to crumble and rot.

Its roof is now covered in barbed wire and satellite dishes and there is no sign of life, let alone the Royal family.

These dramatic pictures give a terrifying glimpse into what life in Britain could look like in the aftermath of a pandemic.

Intact: Playstation took the British landmarks and transformed them into how they could look in the event of a pandemic in the country

PlayStation programmers have taken British landmarks and doctored them to illustrate what would happen to our renowned buildings if there were no humans left to care for them.

Brighton's Palace Pier has depicted as overgrown and its famous rides that attract millions of people to the city have been left to fall into the sea.

Elsewhere, the iconic chimney stacks of Battersea Power Station have either collapsed or churn out black smoke in PlayStation's post-apocalyptic vision.

Developers produced the images to coincide with the release of the anticipated game The Last of Us.

They took eight famous British buildings and tried to show what would happen to the landmarks 20 years after humanity was struck down by the Cordyceps virus, which is central to the game.

Among those chosen are the Liverpool Albert Docks, which are shown covered in plants and the famous dome of the Port of Liverpool Building is smashed and damage.

Uninhabitable: Bristol's famous Clifton Suspension Bridge is just a ruin in the imagining of a post-apocalyptic Britain

Landmarks: Playstation altered images of iconic buildings (Albert Docks, left, and Clifton Suspension Bridge, right) to demonstrate the destruction that could happen if humanity was struck by the devastating Cordyceps virus, the virus the game is based around

Bristol's Clifton Suspension Bridge 
has also been dramatically altered and, although the towers still stand,
 the bridge has long since disappeared.

The historic King's College chapel, at the University of Cambridge, is also severely damaged in the image and its famous windows are smashed.

Elsewhere Glasgow's Clyde Bridge and the Angel of the North are shown as derelict and overgrown with weeds and plants.

The Last of Us is set 20 years after a pandemic has hit the U.S. and cities have been abandoned and reclaimed by nature.

It follows one survivor, named Joel, as he attempts to smuggle a 14-year-old girl called Ellie out of an oppressive military quarantine zone.

The game, released on Friday, is by Naughty Dog, the developers of the Uncharted franchise.
