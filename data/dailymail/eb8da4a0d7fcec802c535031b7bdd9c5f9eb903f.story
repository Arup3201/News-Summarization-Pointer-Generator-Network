Sunderland striker Connor Wickham is considering a move abroad to try and recapture the 'Golden Boy tag' that saw him tipped at one time to become the best English striker since Wayne Rooney.

Wickham, still only 21, was watched by every big club in the Premier League including Manchester United and Chelsea as a teenager at Ipswich before joining Sunderland at 18 in a deal that could have reached £8million.

But the England Under-21 striker has scored only 10 goals in 60 games in three seasons for the BlackCats and spent time on loan to Sheffield Wednesday.

Sunderland striker Connor Wickham is contemplating a move broad when his contract expires

The 21-year-old has scored just 10 goals, including this one against Manchester City, in 60 appearances

With his contract due to expire in the summer, the strapping 6ft4ins centre-forward is able to negotiate with foreign clubs in the New Year and it's an opportunity he plans to take.

Despite his youth, Wickham does not feel it is too early to sample life overseas and follow the example of Ashley Cole and Gareth Bale who are enjoying their time in Europe.

Sunderland manager Gus Poyet would like to persuade the striker to stay after he played a key role in helping them avoid relegation last season.

He said earlier this season: 'Connor is a player he wants to keep, a massive part of our miracle Great Escape last season and he is a very important part to our plans.'

Wickham was part of the Sunderland team humiliated 8-0 in their last away game at Southampton a fortnight ago and a repeat performance at Crystal Palace on Monday night could lead to Poyet's departure.

Wickham was considered one of the hottest properties in England but has struggled to assert himself

The England Under-21 striker can talk to foreign clubs in January and could sign a pre-contract
