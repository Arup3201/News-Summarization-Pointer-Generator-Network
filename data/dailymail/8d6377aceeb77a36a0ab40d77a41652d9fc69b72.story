Prime Minister Tony Abbott has revealed sledging was his only strength as a cricketer

As tensions between the Australian and Indian cricket teams reach boiling point, Prime Minister Tony Abbott has revealed sledging was his only strength as a cricketer.

Speaking at an afternoon tea for the teams at Kirribilli House in Sydney on Thursday, Abbott spoke of his time as a cricketer during his student days at Oxford University.

'I couldn't bat, I couldn't bowl, I couldn't field, but I could sledge, and I think I held my place in the team on this basis and I promise there'll be none of that today,' said the former captain of Oxford's Middle Common Room team of the Queen's College.

Emotions are riding high between the Australian and Indian sides following an explosive series that has featured plenty of sledging.

Indian batsman Virat Kohli has been at the centre of the most recent quips, in which Australia's Brad Haddin called out while clapping provocatively: 'There he goes on his team again. It's all about you. It's all about the one.'

The sledging appeared to be Haddin's way of getting back at Kohli for the still unknown remarks that were thrown his way on the previous day, as he walked out to bat with the game in the balance.

Kohli was  recently criticised for revealing the heated words he shared with Mitchell Johnson (right) on the field: 'I was really annoyed with him hitting me with the ball and I told him 'That's not on: try to hit the stumps next time,' he told media

Kohli's response was to tell Haddin that this year would be his last series, Fairfax reports.

'It's very hard for them (Australia) to stay calm ... it really excites me and brings the best out of me, so they don't seem to be learning their lesson,' Kohli taunted after day three.

However coach Darren Lehmann says he remains unperturbed by any remarks made on the field by either teams, so long as they actually stay between players and aren't repeated to media.

His comment come after Kohli was criticised for revealing the heated words he shared with Mitchell Johnson on the field, which eventually forced the umpire to intervene.

'I was really annoyed with him hitting me with the ball and I told him 'That's not on: try to hit the stumps next time, not my body',' he later said.

Despite the opposing teams smiling broadly for pictures, it's feared things could get worse during next week's fourth and final Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground

Abbott weighed into the debate over Australian captain Steve Smith's decision to delay the declaration in the third Test at the MCG as the hosts failed to take the remaining four wickets to win the match and take a 3-0 series lead

It's feared things could get worse during next week's fourth and final Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground.

Abbott weighed into the debate over Australian captain Steve Smith's decision to delay the declaration in the third Test at the MCG as the hosts failed to take the remaining four wickets to win the match and take a 3-0 series lead.

The home side had to settle for a draw, but still reclaimed the Border-Gavaskar Trophy with an unassailable 2-0 lead in the four-match series.

'When I told people last night that I was lucky enough to be hosting the Australian and the Indian cricket teams here today, the only question that they assailed me with was 'What did you think of the declaration?',' Abbott said.
