Mystery: Paula Hounslea disappeared after a family meal to celebrate her mother's birthday in August 2009. Her charred body was found last week

A woman whose charred remains were found dumped in an old fire pit was named today as a single mother who had been missing for almost three years.

Paula Hounslea was 38 when she vanished in August 2009 after a family meal to celebrate her mother’s birthday.

Her remains were found by a dog walker last week, apparently dumped 12 feet down an embankment in the fire pit close to a disused railway line now a cycle path in Fazakerley, Liverpool.

Police investigating her death believe her body may have been dumped as recently as February this year.

Officers recovered a gold necklace with the face of the Virgin Mary next to the body and Paula’s parents got in touch when they noticed it pictured in a local newspaper.

Police then identified Paula’s bones using dental records.

A specialist pathologist and anthropologist was called into examined the body to try and establish how, when and where she died.

The grim discovery was made just three days after Paula’s parents Steve and Moira made an emotional public appeal for information about her whereabouts.

Officers are now urging locals to come forward with information about a suspicious fire in the area in the past year.

Her disappearance also featured and was discussed by presenter Gloria Hunniford on ITV1’s This Morning show.

Today, Merseyside Police confirmed the death was being treated as 'unexplained' and refused to rule out foul play.

Officers believe the body may have been 
dumped at the site as recently as February this year - two and a half 
years after Paula was last seen alive.

Tests have shown someone could have set fire to the body whilst it was at the site.

The mystery began on Saturday, August 22, 2009 after Paula her brother and two sisters gathered for a meal at a Chinese restaurant for their birthday of their mother Moira.

Her family dropped her at her home in West Derby and waved goodnight, but the following morning Paula went into her teenage daughter Lois’s bedroom to tell her she was going to 'stay with a friend' for a few days.

She never turned up and, although there were cash withdrawals from her account in Liverpool in the first ten days after she went missing, there have been no leads since.

It emerged she had texted her friend to say she 'needed to go away for a few days' but was never seen again.

Usually Paula rang her parents several times a day, but when her family tried to ring her there was no answer from her mobile phone.

It also transpired Paula had tried to call a friend the Tuesday after she went missing but problems with the phone meant she was unable to connect. She also attempted to book a room at a local hotel but never arrived.

Lois, now 21 has since given birth to a
daughter Erin now aged three months. During inquiries police believed 
Paula might have moved to Benidorm in Spain to find bar work but 
inquiries drew a blank.

In a
recent appeal, Paula’s daughter Lois said: 'I’m living on my own in our
house. I miss her so much and want her to come home. If anyone has seen
her or knows where she is, please get in touch.'

In
his appeal on May 2, Paula’s father Steve, 68, a former delivery driver
also offered a reward for information about his daughter’s whereabouts 
saying: 'You just feel in limbo. It’s the not knowing that’s the worst. 
She’s a lovely girl.

'It isn’t easy to come up with money but we are so desperate, it’s something we feel we have to do.

'We feel that somebody in Liverpool must know something and if we offer the reward maybe they’ll come forward and give us that information.

'If anybody knows anything, please, we would love to have some good news. Just to know that she is safe would be absolutely brilliant. She has the cheekiest of smiles. I believe one day I’ll see it again.

He added: 'On reflection on the night before she disappeared, Paula was a bit quiet but other than that there was no indication there was anything wrong.

'She could be the most bubbly of people and generous to a fault. If you remarked you liked something she was wearing she’d hand it over; she’d give you the clothes from her back. For her to disappear was completely out of the blue.'

'Our house was searched and Paula’s home too, but there was no clue found as to what might have happened.

'We were asked the same things again and again. Her closest friends were spoken to but nothing came to light as to why she might have gone. It was a true mystery.'

'Paula’s a gran now. She should be cuddling her new granddaughter and forming a bond. It’s been hard for Lois, knowing she should be sharing that special time with her mum.'

Police said no clothing was found at the scene and the body was discovered 12 feet down the embankment. Officers are urging locals to come forward with information about a suspicious fire in the area in the past year.

Det Ch Insp Phil McEwan of Merseyside Police said: 'Now that we have made a positive identification our investigation into the circumstances surrounding Paula’s death will continue.'
