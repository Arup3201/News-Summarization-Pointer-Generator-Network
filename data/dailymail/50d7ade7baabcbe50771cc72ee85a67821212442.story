Firing bullets at targets in a shooting range may not be everyone's idea of a relaxing holiday.

But the chance to use pistols, rifles and other kinds of firearms is drawing large numbers of Japanese tourists to the US Pacific island of Guam where gun controls are far loser than they are at home.

At Guam's well-equipped shooting ranges, tourists - many of who are women - can use a wide range of weapons from tiny revolvers to Berettas, Glocks, semi-automatic pistols and M16 military assault rifles.

Thrill: Two tourists are taught how to fire a rifle by range master Mike Aeta. Many Japanese visitors are eager to to shoot a gun at one of Guam's ubiquitous ranges

Restrictions: In Japan gun ownership is tightly restricted so large numbers of people head to Guam to try their hand with firearms

Despite a shared sense of shock over the recent rampage by a gunman at America's Sandy Hook Elementary School, the gun tourism business on the US territory is as brisk as ever.

'It was such a feeling of power,' Keigo Takizawa, a 30-year-old Japanese actor, said after blasting holes in a paper target with a shotgun, a .44 magnum and a Smith & Wesson revolver at Guam's Western Frontier Village gun club.

'But,' he said, 'I still don't think anyone should be allowed to have one of their own.'

Many Japanese see America's gun culture as both frightening and fascinating because the only people with handguns in their society are in the military, the police or criminals.

Because firearms are so hard to find 
in Japan, gun-related crime is extremely rare. They were used in only 
seven murders in the country - a nation of about 130 million people - in 2011.
In the US, by contrast, with 315 million people, there are more than 
11,000 gun-related killings annually.

The Japanese are proud of their low crime rate and generally support tough gun-control policies. But for many - a trip to Guam's ubiquitous shooting ranges is just too tempting.

'I think it's human nature to be curious about something that is forbidden,' said Tetsuo Yamamoto, a Japanese native who emigrated to the United States 30 years ago and runs the Western Frontier Village range.

'Most of our customers are from Japan and have never had the opportunity to shoot a gun. It's very exotic for them, and it's very exhilarating.' So exhilarating that he sometimes asks his guests to stay around for a while to calm down after they have finished shooting.

Many other tourists - from South Korea, Taiwan and increasingly Russia - are less impressed by the chance to shoot guns. All South Korean men, for example, learn how to shoot during mandatory military service.

'To them, learning how to use a gun was a chore,' said Patrick Chon, general-manager of the Hafa Adai indoor shooting range. 'It brings back bad memories. They hardly ever come here.'

Visitors to his range are greeted by movie posters for 'The Terminator' and 'Die Hard' films, with their iconic, gun-toting action heroes.

'When most Japanese people think of American culture, one of the first things they think of is guns,' said Natsue Matsumoto, a 38-year-old Osaka woman who said she enjoyed shooting so much she was back at a range for the second time in three days.

'American movies and video games are full of guns and that's appealing, in a frightening sort of way,' she said, 'but I think Japan has it right. 'If you don't have a gun, you can't kill someone with it.'
