It has not escaped Rory McIlroy’s notice that the last time a golfer won the BBC’s Sports Personality of the Year award was the year he was born.

Just like the 25-year-old Northern Irishman this season, Sir Nick Faldo won four times in 1989. Just like Rory, two of those successes were the Open Championship and the European Tour’s flagship event, the BMW PGA at Wentworth. Faldo’s other two wins however, in the French Open and the British Masters, were events far below the standing of the pair rounding out McIlroy’s illustrious quartet — the US PGA Championship and the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational.

Is this the year, therefore, when the sport’s long wait finally ends? In Glasgow, at the SSE Hydro where the Ryder Cup gala concert was held in September, are we about to see just the third golfer crowned (the other was Welshman Dai Rees in 1957, when he captained Great Britain and Ireland to a rare Ryder Cup success) in the 61st edition of the BBC’s prestigious sports review?

‘It would be big for golf, wouldn’t it?’ said McIlroy. ‘Growing up in a sports-mad household, it was certainly a programme I always watched. It was a chance to see some of the greats of British sport being honoured. So I’m really pleased to be part of the conversation.

‘I think when you look at the names of the winners it’s understandable why it has been a while since a golfer has won. We’ve had great footballers like David Beckham and Ryan Giggs, we’ve had the cyclists, the Olympics in 2012 and Andy Murray winning Wimbledon.

‘Having said that, this would be a great time for a golfer to win. If the wider public see a golfer doing his stuff on a programme like this, it might spark a greater interest.

‘Of course, there will always be interest in golf. But it might give it an injection of excitement, like it had in the mid-90s with Faldo and Seve, or when Tiger came along. That would be great from a UK and Irish perspective.’

McIlroy owes much to his dedicated father Gerry, who along with mother Rosie, made many sacrifices

At a time when there has been a significant drop in participation levels and the game is rarely shown on terrestrial television, McIlroy is the sort of poster boy a sport dreams about. His father Gerry worked behind the bar at Holywood Golf Club in Belfast, while his mother Rosie took on menial jobs to give McIlroy his chance. Sport is full of inspirational stories and the fact McIlroy, from these humble circumstances, grew up to become comfortably the best golfer in the world in 2014 is right up there with the best of them.

‘I realise there are a lot of great candidates but if I do win, I’m hoping it will be an inspiration for young kids to pick up a set of clubs and go and play,’ he said. ‘I know all about the numbers playing golf going down and it’s important we attract more young people.’

As ever with McIlroy, the season has been long and eventful. Off the course he broke off his engagement with fiancee Caroline Wozniacki. He has been embroiled in a nasty legal battle with his former management company that will lead to a slew of headlines that will make the front sections of newspapers, as well as the back, when it reaches its bitter conclusion in a Dublin courtroom in February.

In past years, such distractions clearly affected his golf but this season he has done an amazing job of putting it all to one side.

‘I guess I’ve just got used to it,’ he said, with a rueful grin. ‘I think over the years I’ve just learned to compartmentalise. In 2013 I didn’t have the best off-season and perhaps didn’t put in the work I should have.

‘But this year I really re-dedicated myself in some ways. I got back to what worked before, and the results came afterwards.’

The high-point, of course, was that four-week stretch from mid-July to mid-August, when he won three tournaments in a row comprising two majors and a WGC.

Rickie Fowler might have been exaggerating a bit to call it the finest stretch of golf ever played but it was certainly the finest by any player born in Europe.

‘I might have played better tournaments but I’ve definitely never had a stretch like that before,’ acknowledged McIlroy.

‘Winning The Open obviously meant an awful lot, as it does to any player born in the UK. It’s on the BBC, it’s watched by a lot of people who don’t normally follow golf, and it was noticeable to me how much my recognition levels went up.

‘The second one, the Bridgestone, I played really well. The Firestone course is one I love so it was great to win there and get back to world No 1, which was certainly one of my goals.

‘As for the USPGA, that might have been the one I enjoyed the most, for the way it panned out. I’m really proud of the way I played down the stretch to catch Phil Mickelson, Rickie Fowler and Henrik Stenson, with the light fading and all that.

‘So yeah, it was the time of my professional life so far, and it’s obviously nice when people like Rickie are saying such things. But you can’t afford to dwell too long on what you’ve done in this game.

‘The wins are on the board but I’m already thinking ahead to 2015 and trying to win more tournaments.’

What a year it promises to be. Not only will he get to defend two majors; at the Masters in April he will have his first tilt at becoming just the sixth golfer to complete the career grand slam, and all at such a tender age.

‘There’s going to be a bit of hype around that week, isn’t there?’ he said, smiling. ‘That’s fine with me. I’ve reached the stage where I’m happy to embrace it. But do you know what I’m looking forward to the most in the build-up? Just trying to improve certain areas of my game.

‘Yes, I want to win the Masters. But what will help me do that? What’s held me back from winning it before? How can I change the outcome? They’re the things I’m concentrating on.

‘I’m not saying to myself I want to win the Masters because anyone can do that. It’s how you go about it that enables you to achieve such goals.’

McIlroy says interest in golf has wavered since Tiger Woods' decline, but he wishes to improve its popularity

For this festive month, however, the Masters can wait. Time for a bit of relaxation back home in Belfast. Time to keep the gossip photographers busy, no doubt. Time for too many Christmas dinners and one or two Ulster rugby games. The odd trip to Old Trafford, perhaps. And a big night out in Glasgow.

‘I’m looking forward to it,’ he said. ‘It’s been a heck of a year for golf and it could be some night for the game. We’ve got a decent shout for Team of the Year with the Ryder Cup boys, while I think everyone agrees Paul McGinley was a brilliant captain, so he must have a chance for Coach of the Year.

‘And obviously you’ve got me in there as well. Hopefully it’s a night we dominate.’

Given that he does not possess a set of go-faster golf clubs, it has to be McIlroy. Hamilton may be a great driver but he does not compete on even terms with most of his rivals. McIlroy has no false advantages and is up against a much wider global talent pool.

VOTE FOR: Rory McIlroy

Hamilton should have won it in 2008 after clinching the F1 title, but was beaten by Sir Chris Hoy. I fancy Rory will get the better of him this year, too. Hamilton deserves it as a winner of 11 races this year under huge pressure. Damon Hill was the last winner for F1 — 18 years ago.

VOTE FOR: Lewis Hamilton

Ian Ladyman (Northern Football Correspondent)

McIlroy should get it because he competes on a level playing field with his competitors. Motor racing is a pastime dictated largely by engineering. It’s hard to call it sport when only two or three contestants can possibly win.

VOTE FOR: Rory McIlroy

Paul Newman (Cricket Correspondent)

It’s got to be McIlroy for me. Hamilton’s achievement is outstanding but the technology is too important in F1 for him to to surpass McIlroy’s majors and Ryder Cup. I hope Gareth Bale makes the podium, too. The way he has settled in Spain is outstanding.

VOTE FOR: Rory McIlroy

Sam Peters (Rugby and Cricket Writer)

If it’s a choice between McIlroy and Hamilton I’d go for McIlroy every time. Golf is one of the loneliest and most mentally challenging sports around and the young Ulsterman is at the very top of it. A superstar of the modern game.
