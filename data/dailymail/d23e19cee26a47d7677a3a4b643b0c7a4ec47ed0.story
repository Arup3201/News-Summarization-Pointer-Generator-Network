A French former soldier questioned over the Alps Murders case was today found dead following an apparent suicide.

The 50-year-old, who has not been named, had been spoken to by detectives investigating the bloodbath which claimed the lives of three members of the Al-Hilli family, from Surrey.

A parachutist and trained marksman who fought with the Foreign Legion, he left a ‘six or seven page note’ saying he was ‘disturbed’ by the questioning because it ‘made him feel like a suspect’, said Eric Maillaud, the prosecutor in Annecy, eastern France.

Sylvain Mollier, a French cyclist, was
 also shot dead in the attack, which took place close to the nearby 
village of Chevaline, in September 2012.

Since
 then there have been theories that Mr Mollier, 45, was the main target,
 and that one or more local marksmen could have been responsible.

Intriguingly, the man found dead was from the village of Ugine, where Mr Mollier lived with his heiress girlfriend.

Mr
 Maillaud confirmed that the man was ‘questioned for two hours in April 
2013’, mainly because he was ‘linked to Mr Mollier’s family’.

Firearms were found in his home in Ugine, according to the local Dauphine Libere newspaper, which broke news of the killing today.

The
 paper said the ‘violent death’ would ‘intrigue investigators’, and 
would lead to ‘further investigations to make sure nothing was 
overlooked’.

Investigation: Police outside the Al-Hilli home in Surrey in June 2013, almost a year after the killings happened

Comments: Eric Maillaud, the prosecutor in Annecy, eastern France, said the parachutist left a 'six or seven page note' saying he was 'disturbed' by the questioning because it 'made him feel like a suspect'

Eric Devouassoux, a 48-year-old old former policeman, was arrested over the killings in February and spent four days in custody.

The gun collector is still being investigated for arms trafficking, but there has been no further legal action against him linked to the four murders.

Zaid Al-Hilli, a Surrey financial controller who is related to three of the victims, was the first suspect arrested in 2013.

But the 54-year-old has been told by Surrey police that there is not enough evidence to charge him with the killing of his brother Saad, 50.

The younger Al-Hilli was shot dead alongside his wife Iqbal, 47, his mother-in-law Suhaila Al-Allaf, 74, and Mr Mollier.

The Al-Hilli couple's daughters, Zainab, seven, and Zeena, four, survived the attack and are currently in the care of surviving family.

While every detail of the Al-Hilli’s lives has been made public by the French, very little has been said about Mr Mollier, the dead cyclist.

But the Frenchman was involved in frictions of his own over a multi-million pounds chain of pharmacies which was being transferred to his girlfriend, Claire Schutz, 30.

Detectives have also uncovered romantic entanglements which Mollier was trying to keep secret – another fact which might suggest a local motive and killer.

Zaid Al-Hilli has a cast iron alibi - he was in Worthing, West Sussex, on the day of the murder.

He is convinced Mollier was the real target, saying last October: ‘They are covering up for someone in France in that region and they know it. There is something more to it locally.’
