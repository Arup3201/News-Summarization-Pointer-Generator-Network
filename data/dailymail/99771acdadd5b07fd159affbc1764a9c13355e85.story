Chocolate lovers have expressed their anger after Cadbury announced plans to reduce the size of their family blocks by ‘one row’ in a cost cutting deal.

Unlike rival Nestle’s move to reduce the size of Killer Pythons and Smarties last year because of the Australian obesity crisis, Cadbury is shrinking the size of their popular chocolate treat in order to save money.

The best-selling blocks, which currently weigh in at 220 grams, will be downsized by 10 per cent.

The Australasia managing director for Mondelez International, Cadbury’s parent company, Amanda Banfield told the Financial Review: ‘Clearly any chocolate lover is going to be a bit disappointed.’

Anticipating a backlash, Ms Banfield explained the company had decided the shrink the family block because of ‘unprecedented cost headwinds’.

She blamed the increased price of ingredients and rising packaging costs for the change.

Cadbury still recommends the blocks are sold for $4.99 – a price which won’t increase or decrease – but Ms Banfield highlighted that shops set the prices that they choose to sell the products at in store.

Cadbury's parent company’s profit before tax rose 46 per cent from $87 million to $127 million in 2013.

In 2013, Tony Abbott promised the Liberal Government would help boost jobs at Cadbury with a $16 million contribution to factory upgrades.

In 2014, Mr Abbott defended the decision to provide the funding but the money has not yet been provided.

Ms Banfield said: 'We're waiting for a final outcome.'

Thousands of angry chocolate fans have complained about the change on Cadbury’s Facebook page.

Kyria Economidis said: ‘What do you take us for? You guys are thieves, you want to cut it down and charge us the same? You are plain greedy.’

‘Good bye Cadbury it has been a fun ride, but when you make it not worth it and unaffordable and then lie pffft not worth wasting my money how much would it cost to change the size of the chocolate with new moulds smaller packaging lots of money I would assume. I'll just wait for the tim tams to go on sale,’ Kirsty Logan commented.

Michele Forrest wrote: ‘So the slogan will be.......with 3/4 glass of milk in every block. Boo to you Cadbury. What a load of rubbish.’

Steven Jeffery added: ‘FFS Cadbury!! You expect us Aussies to support you & continue to buy your products... But you are continuously down grading your products!! Be fair now!!’

The change is expected to affect the standard milk chocolate blocks along with the many variations including the fruit and nut, rocky road, Crunchie flavoured and Turkish Delight versions.

A statement on the company’s website reads: ‘Over the next few weeks, you will see something different about Cadbury family blocks. While our commitment to providing the same taste and quality of Cadbury chocolate you love remains, you will see a change in the size of our 210g/220g family blocks.’

It continued: ‘Confectionery companies around the world are feeling the squeeze of increasing costs. At Cadbury, we’re feeling it too. We’ve reached a point where we can no longer absorb these increasing costs into the price of our chocolate blocks.

‘So we had to make a tough decision: increase the recommended price of Cadbury family blocks, or decrease the size? We chose to keep Cadbury chocolate affordable for families across Australia and reduce our family blocks by one row.

‘By making this change, Cadbury can continue to support local manufacturing in Australia as we have done for almost a century now. We’ll keep delighting you with new flavours and products, and your Cadbury chocolate will continue to taste as delicious as it always has. 

'We know this is important to Australians. This change lets us keep making Australia’s favourite chocolate, so you can continue to enjoy the taste and quality of Cadbury.’
