Britain is accused of breaching almost 50 EU rules over items ranging from tractors to toys – and even garlic.

In what will be seen as more meddling from Brussels, the Government is being pursued for failing to follow dozens of European Commission directives and other legal agreements.

If ministers fail to address the allegations, lawsuits could end up in crippling fines at the European Court of Justice.

Britain is accused of breaching almost 50 EU rules over items ranging from tractors to toys ¿ and even garlic

One claim, concerning import duties on fresh garlic from China, was sent to the court in September.

Eurocrats also want to take action over the delayed implementation of a directive about emissions from narrow track tractors, introduced by the Commission in February.

Other complaints, about which few details have been disclosed, concern toy safety, the cleanliness of beaches, the energy performance of buildings and vehicles nearing their ‘end of life’.

Details of the 47 legal actions, obtained under freedom of information laws from the Cabinet Office, will fuel the fierce debate about Britain’s role in Europe.

Although David Cameron wants to renegotiate membership and has promised an ‘in or out’ referendum in 2017 if he remains in power, he faces pressure from his own party as well as eurosceptics in the UK Independence Party.

London’s Tory mayor Boris Johnson wrote yesterday that no ‘positive case’ was being made for staying in the EU, which he said had become known for ‘agreeing standards for widgets’.

Critics question the Commission’s cases 
are sufficiently serious to warrant legal action given the burden they 
place on the government’s lawyers.

Eurosceptic Tory MP Douglas Carswell 
said: ‘This is not what we signed up for all those years ago.

'This is 
no way to run a country and it is running our country into the ground. 
We simply can’t carry on like this.’

A legal expert who advises ministers about infringement told the Daily Telegraph that such cases can drag on for years and involve half a dozen government lawyers.

Often the Commission has simply misunderstood the situation, he added.

And UKIP leader Nigel Farage said: 'What have we sunk to when we cannot even make a minor decision about how we live our lives, without being subject to a European bureaucrat or judge? 

‘You 
only have to look at the list of proceedings to understand that the EU 
now regulates and controls every single, little aspect of our lives.’

A Foreign Office spokesman said 
Britain has fewer so-called open infringements than other countries and 
supported the ‘timely and consistent’ application of EU law across the 
union.

It comes as Boris Johnson has said the key question the government will have to answer is ‘what is the point of the EU?’

In
 a scathing attack, he suggested its purpose of securing peace after 
World War Two had run its course - and a new positive argument was 
needed or it risked being ‘yesterday’s answer to the problems of the day
 before yesterday.

The London Mayor wrote: ‘Why have we bubble-gummed together...? Is it to be a united force in international trade negotiations when the EU’s agricultural subsidies so royally stuff the farmers of developing countries?

‘Is it to have a joint foreign policy, when the EU has been so ludicrously disunited on everything from the Falklands to Libya?

'Is it to agree standards for widgets when that could surely be done without this apparatus of supranational law?

'Maybe there is a positive vision to be set out - I am just not hearing it yet...If there is a positive case for this spatch-cocked federation, we need to start hearing it now.’
