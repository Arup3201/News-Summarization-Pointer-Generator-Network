Coal miners in sixties Britain might have had to get up before dawn and work all day in the cold, dark and damp, but the women in their lives look like they might have had much more fun.

Their daughters, wives and sisters - and women who worked for the coal board - could enter the glamorous Coal Queen beauty contest.

The competition started out in the early sixties and by 1969 it was a national event, with the Coal Queen of Britain scooping prizes from holidays to clothes and money.

Deborah Tate, from Ashington, was crowned Northumberland Coal Queen in 1982, aged 19. She is pictured here at the opening of a new pit bath complex at Ellington Colliery in January 1983

One such Coal Queen is Deborah Tate, who grew up in Ashington and was crowned Northumberland Coal Queen in 1982, aged 19. 

'It was a great honour to represent your community and usually came with prizes - a real treat,' she tells MailOnline.

'My
 father Albert Bramley was a miner who had worked at Woodhorn Colliery - as were the two generations before him.

'Dad always used to tell me I could grow up and be a Coal
 Queen, but I'm not sure I really believed him,' said Deborah, now 51 
and living in Ponteland, Northumberland.

'It
 was incredible - one day you were nobody, and the next mams were 
whispering to their children, "Look, it's the Coal Queen". It was an 
honour,' Deborah told Chronicle Live.

'It was 
very exciting,' said Deborah, who has kept her family connection to 
Woodhorn by working as marketing officer for the colliery museum.

'Mining families didn't have a lot of money, so going to Blackpool was a fabulous holiday.

'We were treated as something special and my family were very proud. The Coal Queens were mascots for the industry.'

The competition in 1982 was held at a dinner in a local hotel the night before the Northumberland Miners' Picnic.

Local National Union of Mineworkers representatives made up the judging panel as well as Neil Kinnock who was there to speak at the event the following day.

'The young ladies paraded around in both a day dress and swimwear, and a compere chatted to each one to find out a little bit about them - what their connection was, their interests, ambitions and more,' says Deborah.

'I guess they were looking for an attractive, personable lady who could proudly represent the community for the next 12 months.

'As winner, I was given a sash, tiara, and I think a small cheque, but I was also to go through to the national final in Blackpool in the coming October. Later I was give £50 I think to help with my preparations for the final.

'The big event in Blackpool was amazing to me. It was a huge industry celebration and there were all sorts of other things going on including football tournaments and music.

'We were transported first class to the top hotel with our chosen partner - hubby, sister or in my case, mum - where we stayed for a week.

'One of the event sponsors was a catalogue, so we spent part of the week rehearsing a big fashion show at the Opera House in the Winter Gardens as well as preparing for the main competition.

'We got to know each other very well and really had fun together. It really didn't feel like a competitive environment - just a group of young girls having a great adventure together.

'All of the young ladies were given a watch by Rotary just for reaching the final, and again, I think there was a small cheque. The winner won a gold watch, a bigger cheque and a holiday to St Lucia!

'I've still got my dress from the final and the gold sandals I bought for the event. The watch is still in the jewellery box too, although I'm not sure it works.'

Deborah 
passed on her crown to her 26-year-old friend Jackie Grey, now 57, whose
 father was a safety engineer at Bates' Pit. Jackie was Northumberland's
 very last Coal Queen.

Competitions were initially run at a
 local colliery level and winners would be crowned at local Miners' Galas, but in the late 1960s they became organised into 
Coalfield and national competitions.

The last national competition was held in 
1983.

The mining community had many events celebrating the industry and bringing the community together.

The Miners' Picnic was an annual gathering of the Northumberland coal community, where miners and their families would listen to union and political speakers, watch brass bands parade and compete, enjoy a fair and stalls.

It celebrated 150 years this year.

The photograph with various young ladies 
on a lorry, above, was taken at one such Northumberland Miners' Picnic. Pictured in 
the centre in blue is the Picnic Queen and to the right in the red sash 
is the Northumberland Coal Queen.

A float with two oversized miner statues, pictured below, was used for parades and events.

Deborah Tate has continued the legacy of her family and the mining community by following in their footsteps.

'I'm the fourth generation to work at Woodhorn
 colliery,' she says.

'Which was a working coal mine for more than 80 years and is 
now a museum and home to Northumberland Archives.'

Deborah now works at the Northumberland Archives
 at Woodhorn Museum, where they've released beautiful archive images for
 the public to view on Retronaut, and now here on MailOnline.

The coal queen collection is just one of the sets the Retronaut has unveiled during an ongoing collaborative project between the website and Northumberland Archives.

There
 will be an exhibition of images highlighted by the Retronaut at 
Woodhorn starting September 27 and running until the end of January, 
but will contain at least one Coal Queen image.

Parent organisation Museums and Archives Northumberland have also launched a Flickr page of historic photographs from its collections, in the hope of reaching people who don't normally visit museums.
