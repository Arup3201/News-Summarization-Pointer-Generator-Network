A schoolboy who murdered a man after being told to behave played the role of a killer in a film aimed at getting his life back on the rails.

Ochaine Williams, now 16, fatally stabbed aspiring architect Steven Grisales after he dared to tell him to stop throwing conkers.

Then aged just 15, the notorious gang member with an appalling criminal record embarked on a sophisticated cover-up in a bid to avoid justice.

Now it can be revealed he appeared in a chilling amateur film production dreamt up by counsellors at Park View Academy in Tottenham, North London.

Williams played the role of a bullied pupil whose mobile phone is stolen by robbers who later taunt him and force him to tie their shoelaces.

In the short piece, filmed under the banner ‘Disaffected Films’, a friend tells the weeping schoolboy ‘don’t do anything stupid, I’m telling you his day will come.’

But baby-faced Williams lies in wait for his bullies and stabs one to death off-screen. A girl who finds the body screams: ‘It’s too late he’s not breathing.’

The details can be reported for the first time after the Court of Appeal lifted an order banning the identification of Williams after an application by the Daily Mail.

Lady Justice Hallett said the public had a right to know who was responsible for the appalling murder in August last year.

She increased Williams’ sentence to 12 years after finding the 10-and-a-half year term he was given at the Old Bailey in June was ‘unduly lenient’.

The senior judge said: ‘This was yet another example of mindless violence on the streets of London.‘Mr Grisales, an innocent young man, has died simply because he dared to stand up to bullies.

‘Not satisfied with having strength in numbers and the ability to overpower Mr Grisales without resorting to a weapon, the defendant sought to take his revenge.

‘He may not have taken the knife with him but he certainly knew where to find it in a flash. He took it and deliberately thrust it into Mr Grisales’ chest.

‘He was no stranger to handling knives and far from expressing remorse it seems he was part to an elaborate cover-up which showed a degree of sophistication in criminal ways beyond his 15 years.’

Mr Grisales, 21, had been shopping for his grandmother and was on his way to Silver Street station in Edmonton, North London, when he was attacked in College Close.

He had challenged a small gang of youths who were throwing conkers in their spiky husks at him.

Williams denied being the killer, but was found guilty of murder at the Old Bailey earlier this year.

The thug was a member of a notorious street gang, the 'Northumberland Park Killers' or ‘NPK’ and had a long record for violent street robberies, battery and burglary.

Following his arrest, the teen boasted of his affiliation to the street gang by writing on his prison mattress: 'NPK. Riding the Big Bird. Innocent on Remand.'

Just a month before the murder, he was handed a youth rehabilitation order for a house burglary and ordered to wear an electronic tag.

He was caught carrying a knife at school and police were called to his home when he threatened his mother with a kitchen knife after she challenging him for skipping school.

Yet despite flouting his curfew conditions up to 20 times, the teenage gangster was not locked up.

The court heard the victim was a man of ‘impeccable character and great promise’ who left his family devastated at the ‘needless loss of their son’.

A barrister representing the Attorney General said the original sentence failed adequately to reflect the gravity of the offence and ‘public concern over offences of this nature’.

Lady Justice Hallett apologised to Mr Grisales’ family that she could not impose a longer sentence. She said: ‘In a split second of anger he denied Mr Grisales that life.

‘We understand that it may seem to his family that the result is unfair. However, we hope that they understand we are bound by a sentencing regime laid down by the law.’

Speaking after the case yesterday, Mr Grisales’ father Andreas said: ‘The sentence still only represents a small fraction of the life denied to Steven.’

Mr Grisales had returned to Britain from Argentina to take up a scholarship to study architecture at Westminster University.

His organ donations following his death helped to save the lives of three women.

Floral tributes were left at the spot where Williams attacked Mr Grisales - described as a young man of 'impeccable character' and 'great promise' - in Edmonton, North London
