Saracens survived a late fightback from Newcastle to walk away from Kingston Park with victory by two points.

Neil de Kock, Nick Tompkins and Chris Ashton all scored tries while Owen Farrell contributed 10 points with the boot to give the visitors a seemingly comfortable 25-13 lead with 10 minutes remaining.

But replacement Chris Harris — on his Premiership debut — set up a grandstand finale by scoring with five minutes to go and then crossed again with the final play of the match, leaving Juan Pablo Socino with a tough conversion from out wide which would have seen the match drawn at 25-25.

The Argentinian’s kick shaved the post as Saracens hung on to claim their seventh win of the season, while the Falcons’ losing bonus point keeps them second-bottom of the Aviva Premiership.

But they can take heart from an encouraging performance in front of 9,192, their biggest crowd for several seasons.

Newcastle boss Dean Richards said: ‘We have a five-year plan but on the evidence of this we look like we’re two years ahead of that. I’m disappointed with the result but delighted with the effort. We’re on the way to being a side who can compete with the top sides and we’ll see again how far we’ve come when we go to Northampton next Friday.

‘Chris Harris looks like our super-sub,’ added Richards. ‘I don’t think he’ll be going back to Rotherham on loan now.’

Newcastle made a strong start, with Socino putting them ahead in the seventh minute with a penalty, but Alex Tuilagi’s try after a 60-metre dash was chalked off after the TMO judged the wing had put his foot in touch. In a double blow, the 33-year-old injured himself in the process and was replaced by Harris.

Saracens engineered a try with their first real attack as Farrell put in De Kock in the left corner.The Falcons almost responded immediately when Socino burst through the Newcastle 22 but hesitation between him and Ally Hogg meant the hosts had to settle for a penalty to close the gap to 7-6.

However, Farrell put Saracens 10-6 ahead after Newcastle were penalised for not releasing in the tackle. But the Falcons came firing out of the blocks at the beginning of the second half, with Tom Catterick hacking the ball upfield when Billy Vunipola could not hold a high pass.

Sinoti Sinoti set off in blistering pursuit and held off Saracens centre Marcelo Bosch as he kicked ahead again and touched down for a 44th-minute try, which Socino converted.

Saracens hit back as they upped the power in the pack and extracted a penalty which they kicked to the corner. They then drove the line-out, rolled infield, and Tompkins dived through for a well-worked try converted by Farrell in the 56th minute to give Saracens a 17-13 lead.

It seemed to take the wind out of Newcastle’s sails, especially when Farrell kicked another penalty six minutes later after it was ruled the Falcons had gone off their feet. Then Ashton scored wide out with just 10 minutes left after the Saracens pack rumbled up to the line and Richard Wigglesworth popped the ball up for the winger to score and make it 25-13.

But Newcastle launched a frenetic attack and Harris dumped Ashton after he had intercepted a wild Sinoti pass and picked up to score. Then he scored again with the last play.

Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall said: ‘I felt we deserved the win, but Newcastle must be the most improved side in the Premiership and pushed us all the way.’
