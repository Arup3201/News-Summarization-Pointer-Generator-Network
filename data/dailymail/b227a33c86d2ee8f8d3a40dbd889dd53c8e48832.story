Connor Sorensen was the smallest baby to
 ever be born at Orlando's Hospital for Children, but he has defied all 
odds to survive - and even made it home for Christmas.

Tiny Connor has needed round-the-clock care for the past six months after he was born 16 weeks early and weighing only 14oz.

After months of anxiety for his parents, Holly and Eric Sorensen, Connor was well enough to finally go home for the first time this week.

Mrs Sorensen was just 24 weeks' pregnant when she had Connor. Doctors told her to take plenty of pictures of her newborn in case he didn't survive.

When he first arrived, Connor's limbs were so tiny that his father could easily slip his wedding band around his leg.

'It is amazing to look back on that photo and see how far he has come,' Mr Sorensen told Click Orlando, adding: 'We are so proud of him and every day we call him our little fighter.'

Since his birth on June 24 Connor has defied all odds, and overcome several surgeries on his underdeveloped digestive system.

By the time he was released from hospital he weighed a healthy 6lb 5oz and doctors say in just a couple of months he will be as healthy as a normal baby.

Making progress: Doctors said Connor had only a one in three chance of survival but the baby has defied all odds

'Given how small he was, we werenâ€™t sure what would happen. It truly is a blessing to be going home,' Mrs Sorensen said earlier this week, as she prepared to finally take her baby home.

The couple had been dreaming of starting a family for nearly eight years when Mrs Sorensen found out she was pregnant.

But complications meant she had to have an emergency cesarean at just 24 weeks. When her son was delivered the couple were told he had only a one in three chance of survival.

'It was a great feeling to beat the odds. Especially right on time for Christmas,' Mr Sorensen told ABC 7. The couple said they couldn't thank the hospital enough for their 'gift'.

'Itâ€™s so amazing that the technology is 
available and the skill and knowledge of the nurses and physicians were 
all in one place,' Mrs Sorensen said.
