Anthony Weiner's sexting scandal may not have been sufficiently glossed over by his recent PR offensive as the potential New York City mayoral candidate admitted on Wednesday that more secrets could emerge about his online dalliances.

The disgraced politician appeared contrite during an interview today where he asked New Yorkers to give him a 'second chance', an even clearer signal that he intends to run in the next campaign.

Weiner's apologetic appearance came as it emerged that the former representative earned $496,000 in the past year.

Contrite: Anthony Weiner, who appears to be positioning himself for a run for NY mayor, said in a lengthy interview today that there may be further revelations from his texting scandal

In returns released on Tuesday, Weiner and his wife Huma Abedin reported $312,146 in business income and $135,266 in wages, according to the New York Times.

It has been claimed that Weiner was working in consulting although little information was available as to the nature of this employment.

In an interview with NBC4, the former Democrat representative, 47, said that although he had publicly admitted to sending lewd photos of his crotch in 2011, women whom he had been involved with online where free to come forward at any point.

He said: 'Basically, New Yorkers know the story. I did it. I did it with multiple people. These things were wrong and inappropriate, and I never should have been dishonest about it.

'They played out in the most public and embarrassing way possible. And that’s it.'

Tweet: The 'selfie' pictured Weiner's genitals, and was meant for a female admirer, but he mistakenly sent it as a message that the world could see back in 2011

Asked whether he would announce a mayoral bid, Weiner told viewers: 'It’s a matter of days - maybe weeks - but not more.'

He added that he had retreated from the public sphere for so long because he wanted to focus on rebuilding his marriage to Huma Abedin, a senior adviser to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

Ms Abedin was pregnant with the couple's son at the time of the scandal. 

Weiner has ramped up his public persona in the past few weeks, creating a new Twitter account using the handle @anthonyweiner instead of the doomed @repweiner that led to his demise.
