Among the new generation of brewers is a higher number of women, known as 'brewster's

Beer lovers are enjoying a remarkable increase in choice with the establishment of hundreds of microbreweries, many of which are being opened my women.

Almost 200 have opened in the past year, says the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) – and many of the latest generation of ale brewers and drinkers are young and, in many cases, female.

Emma Gilleland, of brewer Marston’s, said: ‘These days brewers are far more expeimental and this has led to lighter beers with new aromas and tastes which are attracting more women.’

The number of women drinking real ale accounts for over a fifth of CAMRA’s membership, which is an increase of 20,000 over the past decade.

Rather than the mass produced froth of the big brand lagers, which are 
drunk cold and taste much the same, these beers are carefully crafted 
and each has a unique taste.

Historically, the idea of brewing beer on a small scale was the domain 
of grey-haired men in cardigans, however the new generation is both 
young and, increasingly, female.

The rise of the small craft breweries appears contradictory when set against the fact the nation as a whole is drinking less beer, particularly in pubs.

However, its success is being driven by the fact that each one offers a 
different taste to consumers, who enjoy the idea of ‘real’ food and 
drink from suppliers they know.

Key to the brewery revival was a change in the tax laws in 2002 with the establishment the Progressive Beer Duty scheme.

Under the 2002 Progressive Beer Duty scheme, brewers producing no more than 110,000 gallons per year only pay half the normal excise duty – 22p a pint rather than 44p.

The editor of CAMRA’s Good Beer Guide 2014, Roger Protz, said: ‘There has been a boom in the growth of breweries over the last 12 months, resulting in a total of 1,147 breweries now producing beer in the UK - and with more breweries comes greater choice for the drinker and more opportunities to buy locally produced brews.’

In the last ten years 20,000 more women have started brewing ale in the UK, with many opening their own microbreweries

It is only in 
modern times that men have overtaken women as the main brewers of beer, 
as historically it was women who dominated brewing.

‘Traditionally known as ‘brewsters’, it is fantastic to see more women 
rejoining the industry and in many cases giving the chaps a run for their money.

One female owned and run brewery making a name for themselves nationally
is the award winning Mallinson’s brewery.

Founded by CAMRA members Tara
Mallinson and Elaine Yendall at a small six barrel plant in 
Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, in 2008, they moved to a larger 15 barrel 
site in 2012 to help meet the growing demand.

Tara said: ‘Brewing real ale is a great job, you get to experiment with 
new hops, rebrew old favourites and hopefully give the people who drink 
your beer a great pint.’

The number of breweries in London has doubled in the past year following the opening of 23 new establishments. On top of this one previously lost and much loved producer, the Truman Brewery, in Whitechapel, is re-opening this week after more than 20 years.

Another area which has seen above average growth in breweries is West Yorkshire, with eight new starters taking the county’s total to 57 - the highest of any region in the UK.

Breweries have been opened in a former dairy farm in Prestwoood, Buckinghamshire, and a converted school building in Warton, Lancashire.
