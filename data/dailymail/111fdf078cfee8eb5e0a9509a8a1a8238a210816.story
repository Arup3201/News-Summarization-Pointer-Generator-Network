A loving husband has given his wife a 10th wedding anniversary present she will never forget after he secretly organized a full-scale wedding reception and invited all their family and friends.

Self-confessed nerds Logan Fernandes and his wife Brooke live in Avon, Indiana with their two children – 4-year-old Kal-El (named after Superman’s real name) and 2-year-old Harley Quinn (named after one of Batman’s enemies).

The couple, who met at high school, have been married since 2003, but when they first tied the knot money was tight and they hadn’t been able to afford a big wedding with a proper reception.

Logan Fernandes gave his wife Brooke a 10th wedding anniversary present she will never forget when he surprised her with a full-scale nerd wedding which included groomsmen all wearing different superhero logos under their shirts

Every year since, Logan has made an extra special effort to celebrate each anniversary with a big surprise.

About 18 months ago he decided that he would organize the biggest surprise of all for their tenth anniversary – and have the big wedding that Brooke had always wanted.

Amazingly he managed to keep the whole complicated affair a secret from his wife right up until the big day - ten years and one day after they first got married.

All of Brooke’s family and friends were in on the big surprise and Logan even managed to get his wife to try on a wedding dress to size it, by convincing her that it was all for his sister’s (fake) wedding.

The couple's 4-year-old Kal-El, named after Superman's real name, wore a cape and acted as ring bearer on the big day

On the big day, November 2, Logan met his wife outside the local conference center where all her family and friends were waiting to surprise her.

The moment that Brooke walks into the room and discovers what her loving husband has organized is captured in an amazing photo that Logan first posted on his Reddit account last Thursday.

‘The ceremony began with a video playing that I made of the story of our lives up until that point, including all my behind the scenes wedding planning,’ explained Logan.

As a pair of self-confessed nerds, Logan decided that the wedding should celebrate their love of all things geeky including superheroes, sci-fi, fantasy and gaming.

‘Everything was massively nerdy themed, even down to the vows and it was an amazing night,’ said Logan.

Logan Fernandes said his wife would get choked up with tears for days after he surprised her with a full-blown wedding on their 10th anniversary

The wedding cake had different layers devoted to some of their favorite shows including Superman, Firefly, Star Wars and Doctor Who

An amazing amount of detail went into planning the couple’s ultimate nerd wedding.

The cake had different layers devoted to some of their favorite shows including Superman, Firefly, Star Wars and Doctor Who.

Their wedding rings arrived in a box that included a note saying 'Be my player two?' and the rings were labeled Player 1 and Player 2.

Their son Kal even wore a Superman cape as he carried out his duties as a ring bearer, while the bouquet was created from pages of a comic about Harley Quinn.

In one of their wedding photos the groomsmen all have their shirts open to reveal different superhero logos including Superman, Batman, Captain America and the Green Lantern.

Logan told Mail Online that it took Brooke several days after the wedding surprise before she could talk about it without crying tears of joy for what her husband had done.
