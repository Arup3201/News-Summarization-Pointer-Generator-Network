Former winger Robert Pires believes Arsenal would be 'crazy' to sack under-pressure boss Arsene Wenger.

It is ten years since Wenger's "'Invincibles" secured a place in the history books by going an entire Premier League season unbeaten.

Pires, who has come out of retirement to take to the field for FC Goa in the inaugural Indian Super League, was a key component of that illustrious line-up, with some fantastic goals and mesmeric skills helping Arsenal to their last league crown.

Two FA Cups are the only silverware to be added to the Gunners trophy cabinet since, and the growing frustration on the terraces is starting to reach breaking point.

Ill-feeling towards the Arsenal supremo is palpable around the Emirates, with a large section of their support calling for change in the dugout, despite all Wenger has achieved in his 18 years in north London.

A vociferous group of travelling fans confronted the French manager at Stoke train station as the team headed home after last weekend's defeat at the Britannia Stadium.

Pires understands their concerns but insists that Wenger should stay at Arsenal. 

'I understand the fans, I really do. I want to see Arsenal do better,' says Pires, who spent three years out of action before coming out of retirement to play in India.

'But Wenger is the man for Arsenal, 100%. It would be crazy for the board to let a manager go who has made Arsenal into what it is today.

'I do not like to think of what Arsenal would be without him as manager.

'He has spent a lot of money, and I can see that the results should be better.

'This club (Arsenal) changed my life, in particularly Arsene Wenger.

'Arsene is like (Alex) Ferguson, he is part of the club.

'Look at what has happened to Manchester United since Ferguson left?

'Worse could happen at Arsenal.'

The 41-year-old enjoyed six years in north London, and still lives with his family in the capital.

After achieving so much and playing alongside multi-faceted talents such as Thierry Henry and Dennis Bergkamp, Pires admits it is hard not to look back, yearning for a repeat of the incredible football the "Invincibles" produced.

'It was a privilege to play for that team,' adds Pires, who is the oldest outfield player to be taking part in the Indian Super League.

'For me, it was simply an honour to play alongside such quality players.

'Will it (the unbeaten season) be repeated? Who knows, football is crazy. But we will be remembered.

'The goals we scored, the way we passed the ball, it was just incredible.'

One humorous incident stands out from Pires' time at Arsenal, and the French veteran is already laughing when the subject is first mentioned.

'I have not considered doing it again, no,' Pires adds, referring to the penalty routine he and Henry got disastrously wrong against Manchester City in 2005.

'It was my error, but it is Thierry Henry that gets all the questions. We still laugh about that more than anything.

'Now we can laugh, but not so much then. There was a bit of trouble then, but now it is okay.'
