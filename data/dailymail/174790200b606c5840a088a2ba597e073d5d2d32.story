This is the moment a British woman who witnessed 9/11 broke down when she saw her description of how people had to jump from the Twin Towers had been adopted by the new museum dedicated to victims.

Louisa Griffith-Jones, 47, was living in New York in 2001 and refused to turn away as the two hijacked jets destroyed the World Trade Center, killing almost 3,000 people.

Miss Griffith-Jones, who now lives in Norwich, decided to return to the city to visit the newly-opened 9/11 Memorial Museum and found a powerful quote she gave is etched into its wall.

Emotional: This is the moment Louisa Griffith-Jones, a British woman who witnessed 9/11, realised her description of the terror attack was used by the new New York museum

The display was part of a section devoted to telling the stories of terrified staff and visitors who jumped to their death from around 1,400ft.

The inscription reads: 'You felt compelled to watch out of respect to them.

'They were ending their life without a choice and to turn away from them would have been wrong.'

Miss Griffith-Jones, who lived and worked just two blocks away from the Twin Towers, said: 'It means so much to know I have helped preserve their memory and honour them.

'I didn't know the quote was going to be there and to see it carved into the wall was a sad and emotional moment.

'I felt strongly that they not should be forgotten or ignored.

'Watching them was horrific and that part of the day has taken me the longest to come to terms with.'

Ordeal: Miss Griffith-Jones said: 'They were ending their life without a choice and to turn away from them would have been wrong' as she watched people jump from the Twin Towers

She also left a vivid 10,000-word audio account of her experiences - and without her knowledge the inscription is taken from that.

A purple pair of flip-flops she wore on the day, which had a piece of one of the towers embedded in them, is also part of a museum display.

The devastating attacks - along with the crashing of two more aircraft, into the Pentagon, in Washington DC, and a field in Pennsylvania - killed nearly 3,000 people.

More than 1,100 people have never been identified, and their remains have been placed in a tomb under the new museum.

At the time Miss Griffith-Jones was part of a production team working on the Animal Precinct programme with the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA).

She was engulfed by dust and debris as the shattered towers crashed to the ground.

The new museum, which features thousands of artefacts from the atrocity, opened this month.

Miss Griffith-Jones , who runs a public relations and communications consultancy, was invited to view it before it opened to the public.

'In the beginning there were lots of tears but the museum was so respectful and honest about 9/11,' she said.

The trip was made possible thanks to her friends, who wrote to Virgin Atlantic asking for help with the cost of the flights.

The airline generously slashed the cost while her friends also helped her out.

'I'm so, so grateful to the friends who clubbed together for me to go there.

'I'm so glad I got to go during the dedication period as I don't think I could go and stand next to tourists whose experience would be very different to mine,' said Louisa.

'I went to the toilet at one point and that seemed to be where people went to cry and hug in private, away from the main public spaces.

'There was a mutual respect between everybody when we looked at each other because we had all had that experience.'

In honor of the first responders: Captain Patrick John Brown's helmet from the FDNY on display in the museum - but some critics have turned on management for 'crass' decisions made about a gift shop and new restaurant

The 9/11 
museum has faced major criticism since it opened last week.

Most recently it was accused of crass commercialism after it was revealed that the memorial site will 
house a 80-seat restaurant.

The
 Pavilion Cafe, run by Shake Shack 
mastermind Danny Meyer, is scheduled to open inside the National 
September 11 Memorial & Museum during the summer.

A portion of proceeds from the 
restaurant are going back to the museum but Mr Meyer has was forced to deny the location was inappropriate.

According 
to reports, some first responders, who were supposed to be able to tour 
the museum for free prior to its official Wednesday opening, were turned
 away due to party preparations.

'They
 were drinking, eating and laughing when this is pretty much a 
grave-site,' a National September 11 Memorial & Museum employee, who
 asked not to be named, told the New York Daily News of the 60 or so 
partygoers.

There has also been outrage 
from September 11 survivors and victims' families over a gift shop 
attached to the 9/11 Museum.

The store associated with the museum sells 
items ranging from key chains to NYPD dog vests marketed off the 
tragedy.

Jewellery,
 mousepads, magnets, flags, pins, stuffed animals, cellphone cases, toy 
firetrucks and much more are available for purchase. 

According
 to the museum's website, the proceeds benefit 'developing and 
sustaining' the memorial which is run by executives with 
privately-funded six-figure salaries. 

The
 idea of a gift shop alone is offensive to many, but is made even more 
painful considering thousands of unidentified remains of victims were 
recently moved to a tomb beneath the museum.

'Here
 is essentially our tomb of the unknown. To sell baubles I find quite 
shocking and repugnant,' Diane Horning, who lost her 26-year-old son 
Matthew in the attacks, told the New York Post.
