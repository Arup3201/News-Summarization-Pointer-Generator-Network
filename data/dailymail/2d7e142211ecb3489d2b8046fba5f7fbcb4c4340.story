Former tennis star Jennifer Capriati has had charges against her dropped after allegations that she stalked and punched an ex-boyfriend last Valentine's Day.

Capriati, 37, is off the hook on battery and stalking charges after she completed 30 hours of community service at a Tampa hospital and four hours of counseling for anger management, according to Florida officials on Monday.

The charges stemmed from an incident at a North Palm Beach gym on February 14, 2013. Capriati's ex-boyfriend, Ivan Brannan, claimed he was working out when the tennis pro approached him and began yelling.

Charges have been dropped against former tennis pro Jennifer Capriati after an incident where she allegedly punched an ex-boyfriend

Brannan
 told police that he tried to get away by walking to the men's locker 
room but Capriati blocked his path and punched him four times in the chest before a yoga instructor intervened.

Brannan, 29, then ran into the men's 
locker room and called 911.

Several days later Brannan went to police to explain that he and Capriati broke up in 2012 after dating for 10 months and that she had been harassing and following him.

The tennis pro's lawyer Steve Sessa called the police report is 'one-sided' and said last year that the story which was 
circulating was an 'over-exaggeration'.Â 

Brannan, a former Florida State University golfer, had asked the Palm Beach County Circuit Court for a restraining order 
against Capriati last year but the judge declined the request.

New Yorker Capriati broke on to the international tennis scene as a teenager before winning Olympic gold in 1992 at the age of 16.

However 
two years later, she was out of the game and in legal trouble when she 
was cited for shoplifting and arrested for marijuana possession.

She returned to form in the late nineties and in 2001 won the Australian Open and French Open.

She retired from professional tennis in 2004 and was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2012.
