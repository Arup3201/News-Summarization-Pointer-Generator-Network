She once had the nickname ‘Foxy Knoxy’ to reflect her glamorous appearance.

But convicted killer Amanda Knox was looking far from chic as she strolled through Seattle on Valentine’s weekend.

Sporting a scruffy ensemble of a green parka and lace-up boots, the 27-year-old was pictured running errands.

It is the first time she has been seen since news of her engagement to musician Colin Sutherland broke last week.

The bride-to-be, who had lank hair and what appeared to be a scratch over her lip, later enjoyed a curry with a female friend.

Knox and her then boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, were convicted of killing British student Meredith Kercher in Italy in 2009.

Ms Kercher, was found dead with her throat slashed in the house she shared with Knox in Perugia in Italy in November 2007 

Ms Kercher, from Coulsdon in Surrey, was found dead with her throat slashed in the bedroom of her home she shared with Knox in Perugia, Italy, on November 2, 2007.

Knox returned to her home in Seattle in 2011 after the couple were acquitted, but a court upheld the guilty verdict last January, sentencing the former lovers to more than 25 years each in prison.

Knox, who landed a job in her hometown in November last year as a freelance writer, has refused to return to Italy claiming the trial was unfair.

The writer, who released a prison memoir in 2013 for which she was paid a reported £2.6million, initially used a pseudonym for her work at the West Seattle Herald, but has used her own name in recent weeks.
