On the run: Darren Burdfield has convictions for robbery, assault and Class A drug possession

A violent robber has become the third inmate in a week to go on the run from just one open prison.

Darren Burdfield was allowed on  leave from Ford Open Prison, West Sussex, despite being jailed for five years last February for robbery, attempted robbery, criminal damage, assault, possession of an offensive weapon, Class A drug possession and various public order offences.

The 32-year-old was recalled to jail on Saturday after a 'domestic incident' at the accommodation where he was staying for the weekend, but he did not return.

He is now walking the streets and police have appealed for his return. 

Burdfield has become the 83rd inmate missing from Ford, which has been branded a laughing stock by campaigners with more than a dozen inmates missing since the 1990s.

The record piles fresh embarrassment on Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, who has vowed to get to grips with lax security at Britain’s open prisons.

He vanished just a day after Lucas Lamb walked out of Ford less than two years into a seven-year sentence for causing grievous bodily harm with intent.

And on Monday, 27-year-old convicted burglar Greg Disbrey fled HMP Ford midway through a three-and-a-half year sentence he received in August 2012.

The Category D prison holds 521 inmates, meaning the total who have absconded and not returned over the years are equal to almost a sixth of its capacity. 

Sussex Police said  Burdfield was allowed out of HMP Ford on Friday, but was recalled to prison less than 24 hours later following a 'domestic incident' in Worthing, West Sussex.

The offender is 5ft 10ins tall with black hair and  tattoos of swallows on each side of his neck.

Chief Inspector Pip Taylor, who is leading the manhunt, said: 'Burdfield has a large number of friends and associates across Sussex so it is possible that he is in the county still.

'We need to speak to anyone who may have seen him or may know where he is.

'There is nothing to suggest he poses a risk to the general public but he has not served his sentence so we need to arrest him and return him to custody as quickly as possible.” 

Sussex Police has set up a dedicated team to track down Ford absconders, one of whom has been missing since the early 1960s. 

Those missing include two murderers, a kidnapper and five other violent criminals. About half have been missing for at least four years, and 18 escaped in the 1990s.
