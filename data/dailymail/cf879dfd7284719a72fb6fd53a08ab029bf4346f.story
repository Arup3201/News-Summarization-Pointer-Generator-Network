The UK is evacuating Britons from South Sudan today after 500 people were killed in a suspected coup attempt.

The Foreign Office says it has been contacted by 150 British nationals who need help leaving the African nation following fighting on the streets of the capital Juba.

A spokeswoman said: 'A UK aircraft is en route to Juba to evacuate British nationals who wish to leave from Juba airport on Thursday 19 December.

'If you are a British national and you wish to leave Juba you should contact the FCO as soon as possible.'

President Salva Kiir has declared a night time curfew in the city and accuses ex-Vice President Riek Machar of trying to oust him from power.

The British embassy in South Sudan will remain open, but a spokesman said the situation is under 'constant review' while the Foreign Office is also advising against all travel to Juba, Jonglei State and South Sudan's border with Sudan; and against all but essential travel to the rest of the country.

According to the UN around 20,000 civilians have so far taken refuge in its camps around the city to escape the fighting.Â 

Machar was fired along with the entire South Sudan cabinet back in July after announcing he would contest the 2015 general election.

Since the clashes began ten ex-government ministers have been arrested, with the exception of Machar, who is now though to be in hiding.

Machar denies using troop loyal to his cause to try and stage a coup, saying the fighting is due to a misunderstanding between presidential guards.

French UN ambassador Gerard Araud has warned that the conflict has the potential to turn into a civil war between ethnic groups because Kiir is from the minority Dinka population, while Machar is a Nuer.

Following UN calls for an end to the violence, Kiir has said he is willing to enter talks with Machar, but says he is unsure what the outcome will be.

The conflict began on Sunday when President Kiir accused uniformed soldiers of opening fire at a government meeting.

After sporadic fighting Kiir appeared on television to announce the government was back in control and to impose the curfew, but since then clashes have continued and the conflict is now entering its third day.

Since becoming an independent nation in 
2011, South Sudan has struggled to establish a stable government, and 
there are many active armed groups across the country.

Government tanks have taken to the streets in order to regain control and President Kiir has imposed a curfew

Fighting began on Sunday after troops loyal to ex-Vice President Riek Machar allegedly opened fire at a government meeting. Clashes have continued ever since leaving 500 dead and 20,000 seeking shelter in UN camps (file picture)

After declaring independence South Sudan became Africa's third most oil-rich country, after Nigeria and Angola, taking two thirds of Sudan's oil reserves.

In 2012 a dispute with Sudan over oil lead to a 15-month halt in production which cut the country's economy in half.

So far there is no indication that oil production has been affected by the latest clashes.

British nationals seeking to leave South Sudan are urged to contact the FO in London for advice, by calling 0207 008 1500 or by emailing crisis@fco.gsi.gov.uk.
