An investigation has been launched after two illegal immigrants were deported from Italy gagged with duct tape across their mouths, surgical masks across their faces and their hands tied with plastic bands.

Details of the case emerged after a passenger travelling on the same flight as the two men took a snap of the incident with his mobile phone as he boarded the plane.

He asked police who were accompanying the Algerians why they were being treated in such a way.

Film director Francesco Sperandeo claimed the officers told him: 'Get back to your seat. This is just a routine deportation operation.'

Astonished by what he had heard and the indifference of fellow passengers, he posted the photo on his Facebook site.

Prosecutors opened an investigation into what had happened on the Alitalia flight from Rome to Tunis earlier this week after the story was picked up by the Italian media and splashed across several front pages as well as dominating TV news bulletins and websites.

Police justified their actions saying the men had been biting their lips and tongues and spitting blood at officers and other passengers in an attempt to hold up the deportation.

The incident happened after the men landed in Rome and then refused to board an onward flight they had booked to Istanbul.

On his posting, Sperandeo, from Palermo, wrote: 'Look what happened today on the 9.20 Rome-Tunis Alitalia flight.

'Two Tunisians [he was unaware of their correct nationality] thrown out of Italy and treated in an inhuman manner.

'They had brown packing tape across their mouths and plastic bands on their wrists. This is civility and European democracy.

Demands: Gianfranco Fini (pictured), president of the Italian lower house of parliament, has called on the government to fully investigate and explain what happened

'But the most serious aspect is that everything took place to the total indifference of the passengers and when I asked for them to be treated more humanely I was told in an arrogant manner to get back to my seat as it was a normal police operation....Normal ????

'Anyway I managed to take a picture. Spread the word and denounce this.'

By late today, more than 5,000 people had shared the posting with hundreds of comments being posted both on his Facebook site and on the web pages of Italian newspapers, with many expressing outrage.

MPs from all parties also called for the government to investigate.

Gianfranco Fini, president of the Italian lower house of parliament, said: 'I ask the government to explain fully the circumstances of what happened.'

He added that he had asked police chief Antonio Manganelli to look into the incident.

Laura Boldrini, Rome-based spokesperson for the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, said: 'This is scandalous treatment. It is humiliating and unjustified.

'I am completely speechless. I have never seen people treated like this in Italy.

'Those masks and that tape blocked out any word of protest. Can you imagine how those two people felt?

'It is correct that those who try and and enter the country illegally should be sent back, but this process should be carried out respectfully and under the proper procedures.

In essence the only thing these two people are guilty of is seeking better life.'

Although the majority of comments on Italian news websites were outraged at the treatment of the men, several also said that 'the full facts should be investigated before judgement is passed'.

Another asked: 'Those people who expressing shock may well have had a different view if they were the ones being spat at.'

Last month, a report by the Council of Europe - the human rights watchdog representing 47 European countries blamed failures by the Italian coastguard and NATO for failing to help rescue a boat packed with illegal immigrants which had been spotted in the Mediterranean and later sank with more than 60 people drowning.
