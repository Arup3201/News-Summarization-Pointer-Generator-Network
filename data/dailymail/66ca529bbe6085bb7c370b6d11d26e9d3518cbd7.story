A council has removed posters advertising a circus following a complaint from a woman who is scared of clowns.

Leighton Buzzard Town Hall Council said it took down the adverts after one complaint - in a town of 28,000 people.

An unnamed female resident told the authority the posters were scaring her whenever she drove past them, explaining that she suffers from coulrophobia.

The council removed all of the posters and told the circus not to come back to the town unless it uses promotional material without clowns on it.

'We take complaints on a case by case basis but this was a short-term, easily solvable problem,' said council operations officer Lisa Jarvis.

'The circus is on the park which is our responsibility and we are responsible to our residents, so something like that is in our gift to fix, so we fixed it.'

Circus owner and ringmaster John Lawson said the decision was 'absolutely ridiculous' because the circus is only in town for a couple of days.

'What does she do when she drives past McDonalds, I wonder? It's victimisation,' he said.

'We
 don't know who it is, but if we did, we'd gladly offer her tickets to 
come and see... that our friendly clown is nothing to be scared of.'

He added: 'We don't know where this lady lives and we didn't put the posters there deliberately.

'Thousands of people pass is over the week, it seems daft to take it down for one person.'

'She could possibly take another route or we could maybe put up a separate board without a clown on it.'

The circus performed its first show in the town on Thursday and will remain there until Sunday.

It features a performance by Clumbsy the Clown.

Phobia expert and hypnotherapist Christine Black suggested the complainant and council may have gone about addressing the issue in the wrong way.

'The council have merely accommodated her fear,' she said.

'The lady is trying to manage her fear by controlling her environment but she needs to control the irrational fear.'

The Joker, from the Batman films, is believed to have made coulrophobia more prevalent

Scientists generally agree that coulrophobia is a result of not knowing who lies behind the makeup, red nose and hair of a clown.

According to Coulrophobia Facts, research has shown the fear of clowns has increased since the Steven Spielberg's 1990s' film, 'It', which depicts a murderous clown.

The portrayal of the Joker in Batman films is also blamed.

According to the site, the phobia, which can cause panic, breathing difficulty and nausea, does prevent some people from eating at McDonalds.

Coulrophobia can affect both adults and children.
