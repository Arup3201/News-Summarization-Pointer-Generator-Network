Chris Ramsey feels he was right to take his Queens Park Rangers players to Dubai for warm-weather training and is adamant the trip was not a holiday.

The relegation-threatened Barclays Premier League club stayed in the luxury five-star Meydan Hotel as they took advantage of a weekend off due to Tottenham Hotspur’s Capital One Cup final by travelling to the United Arab Emirates for a five-day break.

Ramsey set ground rules ahead of the training camp at the plush Nad Al Sheba Sports Complex but allowed his players time off to visit Dubai’s Meydan Racecourse to wind down.

The Hoops head coach was adamant that his decision to take his players to Dubai was 'the right thing to do'

QPR welcome Champions League-chasing Arsenal to Loftus Road on Wednesday having won just one of their last nine Premier League matches following their latest defeat against Hull City on February 21.

Yet Ramsey feels his team are better equipped to fight relegation to the Championship following their time spent in Dubai.

‘Whatever happens, at that time I feel it was the right thing to do, whether things work out positively or not,’ Ramsey said.

‘I still believe that it was the right thing to do for the players so we could actually sit down, have a few meetings, and have a chat, and see where we’re headed.

‘We worked on a few things. No rocket science. The players knew what they were out there for. One of the things we wanted to avoid was people thinking that this was a reward for something. It’s not a reward. It’s not a holiday. It’s a training camp.

‘If we could have had the training camp down the road it would have been more convenient. We set down ground rules, we knew what we were going there for.’

Ramsey will be without suspended captain Joey Barton after he was sent off for shoving Hull’s Alex Bruce before aiming to hit Tom Huddlestone in the groin less than a fortnight ago.

The QPR manager does not want Barton to stop being himself but reminded the 32-year-old there are limits. 

‘We’ve sat down and had a chat, and he realises that he could have probably dealt with the situation slightly different,’ Ramsey added.

‘The thing is there are players that do have disciplinary records. I would not want to stop him from being that fiery character that he is, but obviously we know there are boundaries.’

Nedum Onuoha, Mauricio Isla and Sandro have returned to training following injuries and are in contention to face Arsenal.
