There are major concerns for more than a dozen Australians trekking in Nepal who have not been heard from since a blizzard and  avalanche hit the area, claiming the lives of at least 29 people.

The death toll is expected to rise as search teams, hampered by bad weather, scour the snow and debris in the areas hit by the storms.

The storm has claimed the lives of at least 29 people, and that number is expected to rise as search teams scour the snow and debris in the areas hit by the storms

The severe storm was caused by the tail end of Cyclone Hudhud, which hammered southern India over the weekend.

Many of those who have died during the storm are foreigners.

A spokesperson for The Department of Foreign Affairs has told Daily Mail Australia 'the Australian Embassy in Kathmandu is in close and on-going contact with Nepalese authorities following the snow storm in the Annapurna region on Tuesday 14 October.' 

'Our Embassy is actively seeking information about the welfare and whereabouts of Australians possibly in the affected area. 

'Embassy staff remain ready to assist any Australians affected by this tragedy. Nepalese authorities continue to advise there are no reports of Australian casualties, so far.'

Amongst the missing Australians are Melbourne brothers David and John Hallford from Melbourne.

The Sydney Morning Herald has reported the pair had been trekking without a guide in the days leading up to the storm. 

The last post on John Hallford Facebook reads:

'Tomorrow we flight out to the Himalaya foothills, escape from our phones and start our long trek. Cya soon friends and family' 

Fears are also high for Nicole Wise, a Sydney woman who was trekking with a Sherpa in the area hit by the storm.

British woman Lizi Hamer (pictured left in each photograph) and her New Zealand partner Lisa Walton are among those feared missing after becoming caught in the avalanche in the Annapurna Range in Nepal

Bazil Plumb, Wise's partner, said he last spoke to her last Saturday, but has since received word she has been rescued.

'She has contacted someone at at Thorong Phedi village', Plumb says. 'The Sherpa she was with called for help yesterday morning, and his brother passed the message on to someone on the mountain.'

'I managed to contact this person today and they said she has been found and airlifted to safety.'

He says he was overjoyed at the news. 

'I felt so relieved, I hadn't heard from anyone at all and was stressing so much. I've been watching all these bodies and tourists on television: I've barely slept. I thought I lost my girl.'

Plumb says he has been contacting the Department of Foreign Affairs, numerous trekking companies and rescue crews and missing person lists.' 

While the news today is uplifting, Plumb remains anxious that he has yet to hear from her.

'I can't get too excited as I haven't heard from her. I have taken the news with a grain of salt but it was awesome hearing news about her.'

A New Zealand national, Lisa Walton, and her British partner Lizi Hamer are also feared missing. 

Anyone with concerns for the welfare of family and friends in NepalI should call the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on (02) 6261-3305 or within Australia on 1300 555 135 (local call cost).'
