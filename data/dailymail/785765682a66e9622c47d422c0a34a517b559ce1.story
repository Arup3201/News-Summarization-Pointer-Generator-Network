Police and firefighters were called to the rescue when ten little ducklings fell down a drain.

The tiny birds were following their mother along the busy road in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire when they fell one by one through the grating in the road.

A passerby heard their calls and raised the alarm and the emergency services dashed to the scene.

Police made the area safe from oncoming traffic, and a member of the firecrew lifted the heavy grid and gently lifted the ducklings one by one into a cardboard box.

It is not clear where their mother is, but Cambridgeshire Fire Service said all the birds were fine and had since released 'to a safe location in the wild'.

A spokeswoman said: 'We were called by police to this incident where a number of small ducklings had become trapped in a drain.

'We were happy to help rescue the ducklings and return them to the wild.

'We would much rather be called to an incident where an animal is trapped rather than see a member of the public potentially put themselves in danger trying to rescue an animal.'

In October, a puppy had a lucky escape after fire crews were called to lift her to safety when she somehow got herself stuck 50ft up on a precarious cliff ledge.

Nine month-old cocker spaniel Ruby had run off after being involved in a road crash on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.

Her owners Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, were reunited with Ruby thanks to West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
