Tragic: Mexican telenovela actress Lorena Rojas, pictured here in 2008, died on Monday

Mexican telenovela actress Lorena Rojas has died after a long battle with cancer.

Rojas, 44, died on Monday at her Miami home surrounded by her family, boyfriend Jorge Monje and friends.

The actress had been battling breast cancer since 2008. 

Her last message to her fans was sent on social media site Twitter less than a week ago, on her 44th birthday.

'Thank you all for celebrating my birthday with me. Beautiful day,' she tweeted. 

Rojas began her career in 1990 with the telenovela 'Alcanzar Una Estrella,' produced by Televisa.

She went on to star in more than a dozen Latin soap operas, including 'El Cuerpo del Deseo,'  and, most recently, 'Rosario,' according to CNN.

The Latin star adopted a daughter called Luciana in October 2013. She became inspired by her daughter to work as a singer songwriter on a children's album, 'Hijos del Sol' last year.

Rojas was initially diagnosed with breast cancer in 2008 but made a recovery. 

In 2012, she was told that her cancer had metastasized in her bones, according to The Latin Times. 

The following year Rojas told Mexican state news Agency Notimex that '[she] was very aware that this disease... is a chronic disease.'

Last year the tumor spread to her liver.
