The King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery staged a 61-gun royal salute.

The bells of Westminster Abbey rang out for three solid hours.

But David Cameron chose to mark the birth of the royal prince in rather more under-stated fashion: with a pair of Union Flag cufflinks.

Patriotic: The Prime Minister was sporting union flag cufflinks as he left Downing Street to travel to Crewe this morning

The Prime Minister usually wears shirts with a button cuff under his Savile Row suits.

But as he left Downing Street today he was seen sporting silver cufflinks with a flash of red white a blue.

He chatted on the steps of Number 10 with a cleaner about his delight at the news that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were the proud parents of a baby boy.

Mr Cameron was up early this morning to catch up on the headlines before travelling to the Bentley factory in Crewe.

It was announced that the firm was investing more than £800m and creating up to a thousand jobs to build 4,000 of its first 4x4 every year.

But the news of the royal birth back was clearly uppermost in the Prime Minister’s thoughts as he got dressed this morning.

All smiles: David Cameron was out and about in Downing Street early this morning, and discussed the royal baby news with a cleaner on the steps of Number 10

Best of British: Mr Cameron spent the day visiting the Bentley factory in Crewe

Speaking outside 10 Downing Street last night, Mr Cameron said: ‘It is an important moment in the life of our nation but I suppose, above all, it is a wonderful moment for a warm and loving couple who have got a brand new baby boy.

‘It has been a remarkable few years for our Royal Family - a royal wedding that captured people's hearts, that extraordinary and magnificent Jubilee and now this royal birth - all from a family that has given this nation so much incredible service.

‘They can know that a proud nation is celebrating with a very proud and happy couple.’

But the Prime Minister’s beaming address to the nation triggered speculation he had lost a front tooth.

Blast: Mr Cameron's cufflinks tribute were more understated than the 61-gun salute at the Tower of London

Mind the gap: Viewers watching David Cameron's statement on the royal baby thought it looked like he was missing a tooth

Mr Cameron looked gap-toothed as he declared the birth ‘an important moment in the life of our nation’.

Senior government sources insisted the PM had not suffered a chipped tooth in the hours before news broke that the Duchess of Cornwall had given birth to a boy. ‘They've been like that for years,' said a source.

Mr Cameron sent his congratulations from Downing Street and not the House of Commons because MPs have already begun their six-week summer recess.

However a special message was sent to the new parents and the Queen by members of the House of Lords.

Senior peers sent congratulations and urged for the family to be allowed privacy in the coming days.

Cabinet minister Lords Hill said: ‘This is a very happy, first for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge personally as it is for any young couple that has experienced that mixture of wonder and relief when their first child is born.

‘But second for the whole country because it means that the succession to the throne is further secured.

‘No reigning Britain sovereign has been able to look quite so far ahead since the birth of his Royal Highness Prince Edward of York as a great grandson to Queen Victoria in 1894.

‘The bells are pealing from the Abbey, the guns have fired their salute but it is the crowds which have once again gathered outside Buckingham Palace which are the real mark of the great affection in which the Royal Family is held.’

Tributes: In the House of Lords Tory Cabinet minister Lord Hill and Labour's Baroness Royall said they hoped the baby prince would be given privacy

He went on: ‘We are right to celebrate this birth as a national event but I am sure we hope that the Duke and Duchess but perhaps particularly the new prince can have some privacy.

‘Royalty carries burdens as well as privilege and those burdens will fall on the young prince’s shoulders all too soon.

‘The new prince could not have a better example of duty and service than that set by his great grandmother and indeed his great grandfather.’

Labour’s Baroness Royall said: ‘This is a moment of real joy for the duke and the duchess. It is also a moment of real happiness for people right across Britain who will think with special affection of the Duchess as a new mother and her son.’

She added: ‘I trust however that the nation will allow them some privacy to delight in their family life.’
