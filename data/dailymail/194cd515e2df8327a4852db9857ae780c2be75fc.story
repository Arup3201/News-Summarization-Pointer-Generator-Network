Jermaine Jenas faces another seven months on the sidelines after suffering a cruciate ligament injury during QPR's run towards promotion - but he is not letting that get him down as he distracted himself on a break in Marbella with his wife Ellie.

The QPR midfielder was seen enjoying the sun with Ellie - who he has one daughter with - at the Ocean Club in the Spanish town.

Wearing a leg support, Jenas, 31, relaxed on one of the sun loungers while he watched his wife potter around.

The 31-year-old former England international suffered a cruciate ligament injury in April, and it is likely he may need to have surgery on his leg.

This could mean the footballer, who made 28 appearances for Queens Park Rangers this season, will be ruled out for the rest of the year.

‘JJ has completely ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee,’ QPR medical chief, Peter Florida said: ‘We'll be taking him to see a specialist later this week to decide the next course of action. 

‘At this stage it would appear he'll require a full repair, which is likely to keep him out for between six to nine months.’

Florida added: ‘JJ is in fairly good spirits all considering. He's been unlucky throughout his career with injuries, but he's in a positive frame of mind. Unfortunately he's just one of these very unlucky players when it comes to injuries.’

In the meantime, Jermaine has been putting his football skills to good use by throwing himself behind a training programme at Burlington Danes Academy in White City.

Before his Spanish trip, Jenas spoke to a group of students before a QPR coach put them through their paces in an hour-long session.

The summer scheme is designed to improve a pupil’s football skill and academic performance.

‘I’m really pleased to be working with the staff and pupils at Burlington Danes. All of us at QPR have a great relationship with the school and are proud to support our local schoolchildren,’ said Jenas, set up, Aquinas Education, a supply teaching agency in his hometown of Nottingham.

‘Education is very important to me. When I was growing up I always enjoyed school and wanted to do well in my exams. 

Jenas added: ‘I know the importance education has on a child and how sometimes ambition and aspirations within children are not always achieved.’

Jenas got engaged to part-time model Ellie Penfold in 2009, and the couple married on 11 June 2011. Penfold gave birth to their daughter, Geneva Lily Jenas, in September 2012.
