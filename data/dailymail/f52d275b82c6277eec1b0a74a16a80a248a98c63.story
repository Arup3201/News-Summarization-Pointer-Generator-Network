Self-confessed 'quiet man' Iain Duncan Smith may not have been much of an inspiration to Tory leader.

But the Cabinet minister appears to have made an unlikely lasting impression elsewhere - after a superstar American footballer quoted one of his most ridiculed speeches.

San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick features Mr Duncan Smith's 'quiet man' defence of his failing Tory leadership on his official Twitter page.

The US pin-up has plastered on his Twitter profile a quote from 'Iain Smith', reading: 'Do not underestimate the determination of a quiet man.'

The quote is taken from a speech given by Mr Duncan Smith in 2002 to his party conference in Bournemouth, amid grumblings about his leadership.

He warned delegates that he would not waver in his mission to transform his party after suffering a second landslide election defeat to Tony Blair in 2001.

He told Tory representatives: 'Go out there and tell the world - the Conservatives are back.'

Mr Duncan Smith said his opponents should not underestimate 'the determination of the quiet man'.

Just a year later Mr Duncan Smith was forced to resign after losing a vote of no confidence in his leadership by Conservative backbenchers.]

He had only become the leader of the party in 2001, succeeding William Hague.

Kaepernick is unlikely to be troubled by any embarrassment about his choice of Mr Duncan Smith as an inspiration.

The quarterback signed a bumper new contract at the San Francisco 49ers last year - worth a mammoth £75million.

The six-year deal, which will see him stay at the 49ers until 2020, has rocketed him among the top earners in the NFL and will see him earn £12.5million annually.

Iain Duncan Smith, pictured giving his last party conference speech as Tory leader in 2003, described himself as a 'quiet man' who would lead the Tories back into power

He will rake in £240,000-a-week in his new contract and, when this is compared to the salaries of the Premier League's top earner, only Wayne Rooney (£300,000-a-week) and Robin Van Persie (£250,000-a-week) take home more.

Kapernick was a second round draft pick out of Nevada in 2011, but he quickly took over the starting berth from Alex Smith, leading the 49ers to their first Super Bowl in 18 years after the 2012 season - a match they lost to Baltimore by three points.

He then guided them to the NFC championship game last season - and another a three-point defeat, this time to 49ers' rivals and eventual Super Bowl champion Seattle Seahawks.
