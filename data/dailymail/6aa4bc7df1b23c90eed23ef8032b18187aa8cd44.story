When Chip the chihuahua-dachshund cross was born, he looked the same as his two siblings.

But while they grew up and were sold off to new owners, he stayed the same size, measuring just over five inches tall.

Now dog breeder Emma Robson, 24, has adopted him as her own and takes him for walks on a lead designed for budgies.

At just under 2lb, the petite pet weighs less than a bag of sugar, and is dwarfed by even everyday items such as a tin of hot dogs.

Chip the chihuahua-dachshund cross measures six inches from paw to back, weighs less than a bag of sugar and is dwarfed by everyday items such as a tin of hot dogs

Emma Robson, 24, sold his two siblings but kept Chip for herself after he failed to grow. She now walks him using a lead designed for a budgie (right)

Emma said: 'He's brilliant and he's tiny. There were two others in his litter but while they grew he's just stayed the same size at around three inches tall to the shoulder.

'He was so cute I just couldn't bring myself to sell him so he's stayed with us. He gets on with all the other dogs, he's very brave and loves his food and playing with a tennis ball. 

'His mum is a Dachshund and his dad a Chihuahua - neither of them are particularly small. 

'He eats plenty of scrambled eggs and pasta so we don't know why he's stayed so small. He's a fantastic dog with a big personality. 

'He's a definite Dachshund - totally laid back and ready to do anything you want. He's incredibly sociable and loves meeting other dogs.'

Emma says Chip loves food, including scrambled eggs and pasta, and cannot understand why he hasn't grown

Chip lives with seven other dogs - Bea, a rescue greyhound, Sky, a border collie, Ruby the cardigan corgi and four other sausage dogs called Nelly, JJ, Coco and Dolly.

Three-month-old Chip lives with dog rescuer Emma and partner Mark Sawyer, 45, a lorry driver, as well as seven other hounds in Tibshelf, Derbys. 

Emma added: 'Chip can be reluctant on walks - because of his size everything is a bit daunting to him. Small blades of grass for him must just seem massive. 

'We have to take him out on a cockatiel lead called a feather tether which is supposed to be used for budgies. 'I've also fashioned him a little t-shirt out of a sleeve to act as a harness for him. 

'Luckily he's not got stuck anywhere or been accidentally trodden on yet, but we have baby gates for the dogs which he manages to squeeze through and we worry he'll get lodged between the bars." 

Emma says Chip has already become a local favourite because of his size and personality. 

She said: 'Everyone in the village loves him. Everywhere we go people stop us to take pictures of him and ask why he's so small.

Emma says people are amazed by how small Chip is, being not much longer than a hot dog, as this bun shows

Emma said Chip has not encountered any problems because of his size yet, but fears he may get stuck somewhere or squashed by someone not paying attention

Emma says one man offered to buy Chip while she was out walking him but she rejected the offer

'I think people find him a bit of a novelty especially because he's a sausage dog. One man even came up to me once asking how much he was - I had to tell him my dogs aren't for sale." 

Emma and Mark also look after seven other dogs - Bea, a rescue greyhound, border collie Sky, Ruby the cardigan corgi and four other sausage dogs called Nelly, JJ, Coco and Dolly. 

The dog-lover added: 'Dachshunds are great pets - I love them because of their chilled out temperament and they're so loving. 

'I'm a stay-at-home mum to the dogs but I rescue Dachshunds in my spare time and make sure they're re-homed to loving owners.'
