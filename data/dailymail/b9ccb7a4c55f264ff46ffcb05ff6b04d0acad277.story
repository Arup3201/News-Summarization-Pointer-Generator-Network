White Widow Samantha Lewthwaite has married a ruthless Somali warlord while on the run after ditching her ‘Suicide Brigade’ bodyguards. 

Sources claim the British fugitive has wed suspected warlord Hassan Maalim Ibrahim who is also known as Sheikh Hassan. 

He is a senior commander in the radical terror group al-Shabaab which is linked to al-Qaeda.

White Widow Samantha Lewthwaite has married a ruthless Somali warlord while on the run

Mother-of-four Lewthwaite, 30, originally from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, is said to be one of the leading players in Somalia's radical al-Shabaab group. 

This will be her third marriage and means she will be given protection by her new husband's heavily-armoured group, according to The Daily Mirror.

The British-born Muslim convert is on the run after she was suspected of helping to coordinate last September's attack on a Nairobi shopping mall in which 67 people were killed including five Britons.

It had been reported earlier this month that she was being protected by a band of loyal al-Qaeda fighters known as the Suicide Brigade.

Lewthwaite, the widow of 7/7 bomber Germaine Lindsay, is believed to be among those planning revenge attacks following the death of al-Qaeda leader Abubakar Shariff Ahmed.

Ahmed was killed by unidentified gunmen last month as he and a friend were walking from a court in Mombasa, Kenya to a nearby mosque.

Security services now fear she will attack Western-affiliated targets in Africa because she blames the Kenyan government for the death of Ahmed.

Ahmed, who had denied meeting Lewthwaite, was suspected of helping more than 100 Britons to join al-Shabaab, which carried out the Westgate Mall shootings in Kenya.

Since his death, Kenya has seen a rise in the number of attacks.

Last year a copy of Lewthwaite's manifesto transcribed into English by one her recruits revealed her plans to wage war on westerners.

She is believed to have moved to Kenya in 2007, just months after she condemned the deadly role her husband Lindsay played in the 7/7 London bombings that killed 52.

Samantha Lewthwaite is the widow of 7/7 bomber 
Germaine Lindsay, who blew himself up on a Piccadilly Line train between
 King's Cross St Pancras and Russell Square stations.

She was the daughter of a former soldier before converting to Islam.

The British Muslim
 convert is linked to the Westgate Mall massacre in Nairobi in which 67 
people were killed, and is thought to be hiding in Somalia.

Interpol
 issued a 'Red Notice' warrant for her arrest shortly after the attacks 
for terrorist offences in Mombasa dating back to 2011.

The 29-year-old is
 the world's most wanted woman after being accused of allegedly ordering
 the killings of two radical Muslim clerics, two Protestant preachers, 
and three others with links to al-Shabaab.

They are reportedly living in forests and caves and getting milk from nomadic farmers in the region.

She moved to South Africa in 2008 and adopted the identity of an unsuspecting young woman who had moved to the UK with her parents as a baby.

Lewthwaite went into hiding in December 2011 after she convinced anti-terror police to let her go when she was arrested following a raid on an al-Shabaab cell.

The fugitive has two children by Germaine Lindsay who was one of the men responsible for the London Tube train attacks in 2005.

She is also believed to have married terrorist Habib Wahid but it is not known whether he is dead or alive after leading a suicide unit targeting Kenyan soldiers in Somalia.

She is also thought to have been in a relationship with Habib Ghani, 28, from Hounslow, Middlesex, who was killed in a gun battle inSomalia last year after falling out with senior al-Shabaab members.

Lewthwaite became the world's most wanted woman after she was linked to the Nairobi shopping mall disaster in September last year that killed 67 shoppers including five Britons.

Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack.

She is also alleged to have ordered the killings of two radical Muslim clerics, two Protestant preachers, and three others with links to terror-group al-Shabaab.

Kenyan security officials have described her as an 'incredible threat' and said they are working 'around the clock' to bring her in.

She is now the subject of a manhunt in more than 200 countries.

Al Shabaab is based in Somalia and is linked to Al Qaeda and the Nigerian group Boko Haram.

Islamic
 militant group Al-Shabaab, which means 'The Youth' in Arabic, was formed
 in 2006 as a radical offshoot of the Islamic justice system.

It
 is thought to have between 9,000 and 15,000 members and in 2012, it 
joined the militant Islamist organisation al-Qaeda as a cell.

The
 group wants to overthrow the UN-backed government in Somalia, and is 
suspected of links to a string of attacks in neighbouring Kenya.

It has been pushed out of most of the main towns it once controlled, but it remains a potent threat.

As of 2013, pressure from African Union Mission In Somalia (AMISOM) and Ethiopian forces has largely degraded Al-Shabaab’s control and conflict among senior leaders has exacerbated fractures within the group.

Following
 the death of British Army soldier Drummer Lee Rigby in May 2013, it 
emerged one of his murderers had travelled to Kenya to train with 
Al-Shabaab.

Michael
 Adebolajo, 29, was arrested in Kenya in 2010 with five others. At the 
time, the head of Kenya's anti-terrorism unit said he believed Adebolajo
 was planning to train with Al-Shabab, yet he was released to British authorities in Kenya and deported.

Adebolajo
 and accomplice Michael Adebowale, 22, were convicted in December last 
year of murdering Fusilier Lee Rigby outside his barracks in Woolwich.

The
 British Muslim converts ran him over in a car, almost decapitated him 
and then dragged him into the middle of the road while ordering 
onlookers to film them.

Adebolajo was given a whole-life term and Adebowale was jailed for a minimum of 45 years.
