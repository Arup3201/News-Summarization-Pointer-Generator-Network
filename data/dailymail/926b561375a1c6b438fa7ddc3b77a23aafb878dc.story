A band of well-spoken protestors, known as The Intruders, are planning to disrupt black tie events across the City after gate-crashing a private dinner to present an award to outgoing HMRC boss Dave Hartnett for his services to corporate tax avoidance.

In a move which could become a new direct action anti-corporate campaign, eight protesters, including two former oxford students, sneaked inside a lavish dinner at a corporate tax planning conference, where Mr Hartnett was giving a speech.

Dressed in black tie and carrying a trophy – the Golden Handshake –  posed as representatives of Vodafone, Goldman Sachs and other firms said to have reduced their tax bill after striking deals with Mr Hartnett’s team.

The other guests at the dinner were delighted, giving the news a round of applause.

But it slowly dawned on Mr Hartnett that the prize was a stunt – and one of the hosts told them to leave or have dogs set on them.

The video, posted on YouTube, caused a sensation on Twitter and threatened to embarrass HMRC for its approach to big business.

Mr Harnett, who retired in July, was speaking at a dinner at New College Oxford on Thursday when the WeAreTheIntruders protest group stepped in with the trophy, flowers and gushing tributes to his help in cutting tax bills.

HMRC was last year forced to defend 
claims it had waived interest on major tax bills, although a National 
Audit Office report cleared it.

The
video reveals that Mr Harnett was due to appear at the gala dinner of 
one of the UK’s most notable tax avoidance conferences ‘where the rich 
swap tips on how to pay even less tax’.

Mr Hartnett initially looks bemused as 
the protestors thank him for helping reduce tax liabilities, but when 
the penny drops he has a word in the ear of one of the other guests.

The group is then told to leave, with one man declaring: ‘You will depart immediately before we set the dogs on you.’

As the embarrassment continues, the group launches into a rendition of 'He's a lolly good fellow... and so say Goldman Sachs'

The group then launch into a rousing rendition of: ‘For he’s a jolly good fellow… and so say Goldman Sachs.’

As the protestors are ushered out of the door, a man shouts: ‘You are trespassing scum. Go!’

The group are soon dragged from the room by a tax barrister who shouts: ¿You are trespassing scum. Go!¿

Yesterday, The Intruders were revealed to be a group of eight friends including two former Oxford students, an Oxford Green Party councillor and a columnist for The Guardian newspaper.

Members of the group have previously been involved in the UK Uncut and Occupy protest movements.

The leader of the group, Stephen Reid, 26, works for the think-tank New Economics Foundation, and is a former student at Wadham College, Oxford.

He said the protesters were 'outraged to discover that Mr Hartnett, who was responsible for collecting tax from these corporations, could be found sharing port and cheese with their executives.'

Mr Hartnett was speaking at the Practical Tax Planning conference, hosted by a firm called Tax Chambers.

The conference, which cost £854 to attend, promised 'to examine in the congenial atmosphere of an historic Oxford College, practical solutions to the ever changing fiscal complications to modern life.'

Protesters were able to walk straight into the Great Hall of the college, where the black tie dinner reception was being held.

Mr Reid told The Guardian: 'The video we shot shows Hartnett looking as if he wants the ground to swallow him up.

'We were soon dragged from the room by a tax barrister who called us "trespassing scum" and "intruders".'

Mr Reid also told The Independent newspaper ' Another thing we've talked about is dinners in the City.

There's an active and lucrative entertainment industry in the City, whisking bankers away to play polo and shoot pheasants.

It will be interesting to see if we could find our way into one of those events.'

A spokesman for HMRC said they could not comment as Mr Harnett left in July.
