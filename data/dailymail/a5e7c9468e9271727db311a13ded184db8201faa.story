Interesting: Troopers spotted Leyla Denise Aykin, pictured, 27, driving 83 mph in a 70 mph zone on a stretch of I-75 near Naples last Thursday

A Florida woman has been arrested for DUI after she told the trooper who pulled her over that she was on her way to 'taste the ocean' and said she'd also like to 'taste' him.

Florida Highway Patrol spotted Leyla Denise Aykin, 27, driving 83 mph in a 70 mph zone on a stretch of I-75 near Naples in the early hours of last Thursday morning.

She was dangling her left foot and arm out the window of her blue 2012 Ford Focus at around 1 a.m. and as she slowed for police she took off a scarf and let it go out the window like a dove.

When she got out of the vehicle, the Orlando woman did a 'wide stretch of her arms' and 'appeared high' with a 'lights on nobody home' look in her eyes, the trooper noted in his report.

According to the Orlando Sentinel, when the trooper asked Aykin to place her hands on the rear of her car, she ignored him, choosing instead to kneel down and whisper a Muslim prayer.

She then told him she 'wanted to taste me and gaze through me,' the trooper wrote in his report.

When asked where she was heading to in such a hurry, Aykin replied 'to taste the ocean' before beginning to sing and chant.

Finally, the trooper asked her if there was anyone that she wanted authorities to contact and she replied that there was.

'Jesus,' she said, according to the report.

Facebook: The Facebook page of Aykin, pictured left and right, reveals similar behavior. In one post she described herself as 'an over grown mutated 5th Grader' and an 'interdimensional vajra yogini' in another

Police found a green leafy substance in her car, which she claimed was 'sting nettle' used to make tea. It later tested negative for marijuana.

Two BAL tests registered 0.000 but a law enforcement drug recognition expert deemed her to be impaired, on something, and booked her on DUI charges.
