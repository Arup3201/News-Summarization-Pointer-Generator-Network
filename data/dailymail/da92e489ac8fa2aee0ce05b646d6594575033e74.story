An estimated five million Australian adults continue to be affected by childhood abuse 

The Australian government could save between $6.8 billion and $9.1 billion a year by effectively responding to child abuse, a new report has found.

Commissioned by Adults Surviving Child Abuse (ASCA), a national organisation which works to assist adults who have been scarred by childhood traumas, the study was completed by Pegasus Economics to highlight the financial costs of dealing with the long-term impacts of child abuse experienced by about five million adults across the country.

It found that if the government invested in timely and comprehensive interventions for children who experience sexual, emotional and physical abuse, it could avoid spending millions of dollars on dealing with the destructive coping mechanisms developed by victims later down the track.

'Early life trauma and abuse affect the developing brain and have many possible impacts on daily adult life,' the report states.

'These include the coping strategies children adopt... [which] may still be used in adult life. Perpetuated when the underlying trauma is not resolved, these coping strategies are associated with health risks in adulthood.'

Strategies can include alcohol abuse, drug abuse, eating disorders, overeating and smoking and can also see adults have 'encounters with the criminal justice system'.

A report commissioned by Adults Surviving Child Abuse found that the government spends up to $9.1 million each year on dealing with the destructive coping mechanisms (some of which are pictured in the table above) developed by abuse victims in their childhood and often continued on later in life 

'The resultant effects of such behaviours include mental health issues, medical problems (lung and heart disease -smoking, obesity-diet, liver disease-substance abuse related, suicide); social problems (criminal convictions and jail sentences); and economic problems (loss of income, gambling debt) to name a few.'

Individual costs associated with some of these behaviours were also assessed by the report, which found that on average $4984 per person is spent on addressing alcohol abuse in  childhood trauma victims.

This is coupled with the $5281 per person spent on addressing suicide issues, $6042 on eating disorders and $7687 on mental illness.

A number of recommendations are made by the report including training GPs to identify trauma in their patients and deal with it appropriately, as well as investment in help lines and online counselling services.

'The GP role is critical - they see many survivors every day and if trauma is not on their radar they won't think about it,' ASCA's director Dr Cathy Kezelman told the ABC.

Barbara, a Queensland woman who suffered sexual and physical abuse in various homes throughout 16 years of her childhood, which the government offered her $21,000 in compensation for, said she welcomed the report

Dr Kezelman urged the government to read the report and recognise the benefits of investing in effective strategies for dealing with child abuse.

'We are in a situation where we have a major structural budget deficit so this is in response to Tony Abbott's call for policy around saving the projected exponentially expanding health forecast,' she said. 

Barbara, a Queensland woman who suffered sexual and physical abuse in various homes throughout 16 years of her childhood, told the ABC that she welcomed the report.

She also opened up about the trauma she continues to experience which the government offered her $21,000 in compensation for.

'I can't sleep without the light on, I am constantly angry, I don't want to be around people,' she said.
