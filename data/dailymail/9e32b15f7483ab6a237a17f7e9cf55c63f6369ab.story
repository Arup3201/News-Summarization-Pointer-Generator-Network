With six of its fleet experiencing technical problems in the last week, it's no secret that Qantas has had a turbulent week. 

Four flights were forced to make emergency landings on Monday and Tuesday due to technical problems. A fifth and sixth plane experienced mechanical and technical issues in Canberra yesterday, causing major disruptions at the airport.

One union is claiming that recent changes at the airline, including cuts to the workforce and outsourcing of maintenance work, have had a knock-on effect to the safety of the planes.

Unions have piped up claiming controversial changes at the airline, involving cuts to the workforce and outsourcing of maintenance work have had a knock-on effect on the safety of the planes 

Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Trade Workers Union National Secretary Tony Sheldon said he believes that maintenance standards have been slipping at the national carrier and claimed that the majority of maintenance engineers overseas working on Qantas planes are unlicensed.

According to Mr Sheldon, the outsourcing of maintenance overseas now means that Qantas has less direct control over its employees and that this situation has had a knock-on effect to operations and safety.

 Trade Workers Union National Secretary Tony Sheldon said standards have been slipping at the national carrier due to it's maintenance operations and claimed the majority of maintenance engineers overseas working on Qantas planes are unlicensed

'Submissions to a Senate enquiry show there is a much higher ratio of unlicensed to licensed engineers performing maintenance in outsourced Asian facilities than in Australia,' Mr Sheldon said. 

'An efficient airline needs to be profitable with a well maintained aircraft fleet, but this appears to be wanting after what has happened,' he said.

Mr Sheldon urged Qantas management to sit down with its workforce to ensure standards are maintained.

 Mr Sheldon urged Qantas management to sit down with its workforce to ensure standards are maintained so that Qantas remains viable in the future.

'This is an airline with a great reputation but the decision to strip back its highly experienced workforce has lowered standards.' he said.

However, Qantas have rubbished Mr Sheldon's claims, stating that each of their planes must pass Civil Aviation Safety Authority standards before they are deemed safe enough to fly. 

A Qantas spokesperson said the airline always strived to put the safety of their passengers first and that the carrier is one of the most regulated in the world.

'This all needs to be put into context – every single airline around the world experiences diversions and air turnbacks from time to time. 

'Modern aircraft are very sophisticated but they are also very complex, sometimes things do happen that result in airlines diverting as a precaution.'

Qantas spokeswoman Sharna Rhys-Jones told Daily Mail Australia that the majority of Qantas maintenance is carried out in Australia.

However, due to lack of resources at Australian facilities, a number of international planes are maintained overseas.

Ms Rhys-Jones said the offshore facilities are dedicated maintenance facilities and Australian engineers are sent overseas with the planes to oversee their upkeep. 

She said that there are specialist Qantas engineers at all international ports who are on-hand to provide maintenance work to the vast fleet

'The aviation industry is one of the most highly-regulated industries in the world. All maintenance on Australian aircraft needs to be conducted at facilities approved by Australia's aviation safety regulator, CASA – whether it be onshore or offshore,' Ms Rhys-Jones said. 

'Regardless of geography, all our maintenance is done at facilities approved by CASA and to Qantas' high standards.' 

Geoffrey Thomas, Editor-In-Chief of Airlineratings.com and aviation expert told Daily Mail Australia that he believes the Trade Workers Union is using scaremongering tactics to instill fear into the Australian public.

'They’re putting the fear of death into people that are flying and 60% of people who fly have a fear of flying."

He said the Qantas group operates around 1000 flights a day and blames social media for the high level of attention the recent Qantas blunders received.

'Their turnback rate on the Boeing 737 is half the world average,' he said. 

It had begun as a positive day for Qantas when CEO Alan Joyce announced a half-year profit of between $300 and $350 million. Geoffrey Thomas, Editor-In-Chief of Airlineratings.com and aviation expert told Daily Mail Australia that he believes the Trade Workers Union is using scaremongering tactics, aiming to instil fear in the Australian public

'Their engine shut down rate is well below the world average and a couple of times it's world leading for the lowest number of shut downs, so the actual hard numbers don’t support the prognosis that there’s a problem at Qantas.'

Chaos ensued this week after the six flights were grounded due to technical issues.

One plane had an issue with the warning system in the cockpit and was grounded for two hours at Hobart Airport.

Another flight travelling from Sydney to Dallas was forced to return to Sydney four hours into its journey.

On Monday, two aircraft were forced to land at Perth Airport in two separate incidents.

In the early hours of the morning, a Dubai-to-Sydney flight was forced to land when air pressure in the cabin suddenly dropped. 

Later that day, a domestic Qantas flight was turned back to Perth due to a 'strange odour' in the cabin.

The week began with good news for the airline, when Qantas CEO Alan Joyce announced that the airline is likely to post a first-half profit, sending the airline's shares 14 per cent higher.
