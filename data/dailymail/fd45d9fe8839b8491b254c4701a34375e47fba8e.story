When President Obama first met Burma's Nobel prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi two years ago, their awkward embrace  caught the media's attention.

A kiss on the cheek by the Commander in Chief was branded by some as inappropriate and in poor taste. 

But it seemed the democracy activist was over-compensating for their last encounter, as she kissed the US leader on both cheeks before pulling him in for a hug.

The pair held a press conference, allowing Obama to show his support as the nation turns towards elections next year.

However, in scenes reminiscent of 2012, their handshake, kiss and hug seemed a little strained.   

Social media users took to Twitter after the encounter. Rahul Tyagi ‏said: 'Did someone else notice Aung San Suu Kyi' s kiss to Obama? Almost over compensation for the kiss Obama gave 2 years ago.'

Journalist Anita Bennett said: 'Watching Obama newser from Burma on @CNN. Confused why Suu Kyi just hugged, kissed and felt up Obama on live TV #Awkward.'

Before the meeting, the president exited his limo and flashed a big smile as he walked up to greet Suu Kyi at the front door.

They met privately before addressing the press at a joint news conference on her lawn.

Reaction: Journalist Anita Bennett was one of the first people to describe the 'akward' moment that was caught on camera

Obama and Suu Kyi met briefly yesterday in Naypyitaw, but today they are expected to have a more in-depth discussion about the government's stalling reform and her unique role in progressing the transition to civilian rule.

The beloved activist has been urging the US to step up its involvement and recently accused the US of being 'overly optimistic.'

'What significant reforms have been taken within the last 24 months?' she asked at a news conference last week. 'This is something the United States needs to think very seriously about as well.'

Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) party is widely expected to sweep polls in late 2015, but its figurehead is banned from the presidency by a constitutional clause. 

In 2012  the US leader throw his political might behind Burma's transition from junta rule. After the conference Michael Aung-Thwin, professor of Asian Studies at the University of Hawaii, said that it is not custom for women to kiss in public, which is why Suu Kyi may have shied away.

He told the International Business Times: 'It is not at all the custom (in Burma, also known as Burma) as it is here in Hawaii, and (Suu Kyi's) backing away is almost instinctive for most Burmese women, even those brought up in or have lived a long time in the West.'

After talks with his counterpart Thein Sein late Thursday Obama expressed cautious optimism hope for the once-cloistered nation that balanced out earlier warnings on the risks of 'backsliding' on the transition.

'The democratic process in Burma is real,' Obama said.

'We recognise change is hard and you do not always move in a straight line but I'm optimistic.'

During his two-night trip to Burma the US leader has also raised alarm over the direction of reforms, however, citing the cramping of freedom of expression, ongoing conflicts and the treatment of Burma's minority groups -- especially the Muslim Rohingya.

Obama was whisked from Yangon airport to tour the British colonial-era secretariat building in downtown Yangon where Suu Kyi's father, independence hero General Aung San, was gunned down by political rivals in 1947. 

On his last visit in 2012 Obama received a fanfare welcome from thrilled locals a year after Thein Sein began to open up the country.

Most political prisoners have been released and elections have seen Suu Kyi become a lawmaker, while foreign investors have arrived in lockstep with the lifting of most sanctions.

But the atmosphere has slowly soured, with many observers saying reforms have stalled.

Suu Kyi cautioned against US 'over-optimism' ahead of Obama's visit, with even her star power earned as the torch-bearer of democracy during the dark junta years having waned in the eyes of some.

For his part, Obama has been battered domestically with poor approval numbers compounded by a thumping defeat for his Democrats in last week's mid-term elections.

He has invested a large amount of political capital in Burma's transition from military rule and hopes his second visit will boost the process as elections edge closer.

His visit has coincided with the start of a debate on constitutional reform, in particular over the clauses effectively blocking a presidential bid by Suu Kyi and reserving 25 percent of seats for the military.

While Obama is cautiously optimistic on the long game for impoverished Burma, many ordinary people are not as easily convinced.

'I wondered when Obama first came, whether things will be better,' 52-year-old street stall holder Minny Oo Aung told AFP in Yangon, where security is high, with clusters of police about every hundred metres.

'But there has been no improvement in our society or economy.'
