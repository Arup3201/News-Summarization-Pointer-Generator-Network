A teenager was stabbed in a 'senseless and tragic' attack after stepping in to protect a friend at a house party advertised on Facebook, a court has heard.

Jay Whiston, 17, from Clacton, Essex, died of a stab wound to the heart after trouble broke out at the house party in Colchester on September 8, 2012.

Edward Redman, 18, from Colchester, who is accused of stabbing the teenager to death, denies murder.

Jay Whiston died from a stab wound to the chest after trouble broke out at a house party in a quiet residential area in Colchester on September 8, 2012

Chelmsford Crown Court heard today how Jay stumbled to a neighbouring house after sustaining the stab wound at the party, which was held in a quiet residential street and attended by around 100 people.

The jury of seven men and five women heard how Redman demanded partygoers gave him alcohol they had brought which they refused, prompting Redman 
to punch one of Jay’s friends.

Prosecutor Mark Milliken-Smith QC told the court: 'It would appear Jay Whiston stepped in and pushed Redman back saying "we don’t want trouble" - but Redman clearly did.'

The court then heard how Redman launched into a vicious attack which
 only ended when Jay slumped to the floor before staggering next door 
for help.

Redman and a group of his friends followed Jay, and the defendant was allegedly heard to say: 'I’m going to do him in.'

The
 court heard how Redman’s friend launched a glass bottle at Jay before 
Redman stabbed him again as the attack spilled out into the street.

Redman fled the scene as Jay collapsed and was rushed to hospital where he was pronounced dead at 10.57pm.

A post-mortem revealed Jay suffered two puncture wounds, one to the abdomen and a fatal blow to the upper chest.

His family packed the public gallery at Chelmsford Crown Court today as the trial got underway.

His
 mother, Caroline Shearer, was visibly moved as she heard the harrowing 
evidence of what happened on the night of her son’s tragic death.

Edward
 Redman appeared in the dock today with his father, Gary Redman, 51, and his 
brother, John Redman, 19, both from Colchester, Essex, who are both 
charged with conspiring to pervert the course of justice.

The charge relates to evidence which has never been recovered and was allegedly destroyed soon after the party.

Redman’s former girlfriend Shannon Fenlon, 19, from Clacton, is also charged with conspiring to pervert the course of justice.

All three deny the charges but the jury was told all three defendants accused of perverting the course of justice made a 
concerted effort to ensure that any significant evidence linking Redman 
to the murder was destroyed.

The court heard that Redman went to his girlfriend's house immediately after the party to 'distance himself from what he had done and to distance himself from the police'.

Mr Milliken-Smith told the jury that when Redman's mother went to collect him the next day he told her he had been in a fight with 'pushing and shoving'.

Redman's mother noticed he was not wearing the same clothing he had been wearing and noticed a 'bonfire smell' when he got into the car, jurors were told.

Mr Milliken-Smith said that after the incident 'social media was understandably abuzz'.

The jury was told that via messaging, Redman was asked by someone if he stabbed Mr Whiston, to which he replied: 'Yeah, I did.'

When asked why he carried out such an act, the jury heard that he replied: 'I didn't mean to.'

Mr Milliken-Smith said Redman then claimed a fight broke out because they were all drunk.

The jury was told about how Redman went to a girl's house after she was visited by police and said he wanted to know what she told them.

Mr Milliken-Smith said he was, at least in part, 'creating an air of intimidation', should anyone say anything against him.

The prosecutor told the court that his former girlfriend Fenlon was at a different party that night and said that when she got off the phone from Redman, friends said she had 'gone completely white'.

She told them her boyfriend had been in a fight and was in trouble and needed to get out of Colchester, the court heard.

Addressing the jury, Mr Milliken-Smith said: 'You all need to ask yourselves how he knew there was a stabbing.'

He also said 
the case 'demonstrates the senseless and tragic taking of a young life, 
so full of promise'.

'It’s
 another desperate example of the catastrophe and heartbreak brought 
about by the indiscriminate and cowardly use of knives.

'If any more 
evidence was needed that knife crime was prevalent, the events didn’t 
take place in a gang-overrun inner city estate but at a party staged at a
 house in suburban Colchester.'

The trial, which is expected to last up to 10 weeks, continues.
