Stoke utility player Geoff Cameron is to undergo surgery to fix a troublesome hernia problem.

The United States international has made just one appearance this season, in the Capital One Cup victory over Portsmouth, but was forced off with the long-standing injury before half-time.

Cameron's absence is the second injury blow to hit the Potters after forward Peter Odemwingie had an operation on damaged knee ligaments.

'It's been troubling him for a while, so the time has come for an operation,' assistant manager Mark Bowen told The Sentinel.

'He started feeling it last season, then obviously went to the World Cup and came back to us still feeling a bit sore.

'These things tend to manifest themselves over a period of months and now the time has come, but it's difficult to say how long we will lose him for.'

Odemwingie, who has been omitted from Stoke's 25-man squad submitted to the Premier League for the first half of the campaign because of the length of his lay-off, has yet to start rehabilitation but Bowen remains optimistic.

'The operation seems to have gone well, which is obviously great news and it always helps a recovery when you've got someone of Peter's great spirits,' he added.

There was more positive news on midfielder Stephen Ireland, who returned to training on Tuesday after a rib injury sustained on August 22.

'He (Ireland) came through training okay and if he isn't ready for this weekend, then I'm sure he'll be banging on the door for the weekend after,' said Bowen.
