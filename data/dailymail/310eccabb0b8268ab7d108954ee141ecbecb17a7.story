Six public housing properties with a multimillion dollar view of Sydney harbour are set to go under the hammer while the tenants have been relocated.

The heritage-listed homes in Millers Point and Dawes Point are the first of the 293 government-owned properties, 214 of which are heritage-listed, to be auctioned in a bid to make an expected hundreds of millions of dollars.

The NSW government’s justification for evicting the 300 tenants, many of whom have lived in the properties for the entire lives, was that three houses could be built in other Sydney suburbs for every house sold in Millers Point.

The government’s justification for evicting the tenants, many of whom have lived in the properties for the entire lives, was that three houses could be built in other Sydney suburbs for every house sold in Millers Point.

Family and Community Services minister Gabrielle Upton said it wasn’t fair to the 58,000 applicants on the social housing waiting list for the government to spend hundreds of millions of dollars maintaining properties unsuitable public housing.

‘While we are very conscious that this involves relocating tenants who live in these properties, a tough decision had to be taken that will benefit far more people in need of housing assistance,’ she said.

Finance and Services minister Dominic Perrottet, said the process of relocating tenants was being done with ‘sensitivity and compassion’ and a Tenant Relocation Team was ‘going to great lengths to satisfy their specific requests’.

The government claims to restore and maintain the properties would cost as much as $100million and the average maintenance bill of each house averages about $14,500 a year compared with $3,000 to $3,500 across the rest of NSW.

The Daily Telegraph reported that the houses are expected to sell up to 1.8million each while similar properties in the area have been known to be sold for up to $3million.

Finance and Services minister Dominic Perrottet, said the planning or the sales processes for the Millers Point properties would not be rushed because they were of important historical significance for the people of NSW.

The marketing of the properties will begin next week.
