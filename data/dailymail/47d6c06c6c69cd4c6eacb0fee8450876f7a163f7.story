The mother of an anorexic teenager says her daughter was 'left to die by the NHS' and says she is is 'appalled' at the care the teenager received.

Sian Clarke, 19, from Smith's Wood, Solihull, West Midlands, was sectioned under the Mental Health Act weighing just five stone and 11lbs last October.

Her mother Denise says she was was moved between five hospitals in just eight months and in that time her weight plummeted further still to just four stone and 10lbs.

The 40 year-old hairdresser said: : 'She was left to die.

'She was passed between five hospitals in eight months, and none of them could treat her anorexia.

'The doctors told me that she was on the brink of death.'

Sian was first admitted to a hospital in Birmingham, then moved to Ealing, London.

Doctors
then decided that Sian would be better suited to psychiatric support, 
so she was transferred to secure psychiatric unit at the Cygnet Hospital
in Bradford, where violent patients were also being treated.

She was then transferred to a hospital in Derby, but returned to Bradford due to lack of funding.

On Tuesday she was transferred back to the Cygnet Hospital in Derby - a move which her family says saved her life.

He mother said: 'It's no joke to say that I would be planning her funeral now if she hadn't finally made it to the centre in Derby. It's shocking, and I'm absolutely appalled.

'The NHS has got a lot to answer for. This is somebody's life. Everyone seems to blame someone else.

'Someone has to be responsible for what has happened. When I visited her in the psychiatric unit in Bradford, it would take all my strength to fight back the tears.

'She felt like she is being punished, that no one is listening to her.'

Sian's struggle with weight loss began when she was 15 years old. She was bullied at college and stopped eating.

A year later she received treatment at a hospital in Stafford and made a good recovery. But Sian's problems resurfaced and by October she had lost half her body weight.

She has now made a desperate plea for better services to treat mental health patients as she battles to stay alive.

Speaking
from her hospital bed, she said: 'I am still a human being and I should
be allowed to have a say in what is best for me. This is putting a huge
strain on me and my family - financially and emotionally.

'People
need to start listening to patients with mental health problems. Nurses
are supposed to be helping people but they are becoming so clogged up 
with paper work - there is no care.'

Mrs Clarke said Sian was awas a 'lovely and bubbly girl' growing up but started to lose weight after getting bullied at school.

'She would skip meals, or eat very little and throw the rest away.

'I didn't know it at the time, but she was sneakily doing exercises in the middle of the night in her bedroom.

'Eventually someone at school realised that something was very wrong, and she was referred for help.'

She said she has felt helpless trying to get the appropriate care for Sian, especially while she was in Bradford. Travelling to and from the different health units has also placed a financial strain on the family.

'All the staff at Bradford were lovely to Sian, but they didn't have the facilities to cope with her anorexia,' she said.

'All they could do there was keep her safe, but she wasn't getting the treatment she needed.

'She would be given meals and be left to get on with it. The ward didn't have to resources or skills to help her.

'She was on a secure ward with very unwell patients who would be very loud and often violent.

'There were panic alarms going off all night and she could barely sleep. Because she was so small and petite, the other patients seemed to target her and she ended up with a few bruises.

'It was quite terrifying for her, and there was no way she could begin her recovery in that environment.

'It's appalling how Sian has been treated. She should be on the road to recovery by now.

'She would phone me screaming in fear, and she had a few run-ins with other patients.

'It's a big relief that she is finally in somewhere that can help her.'

Karen Helliwell, director of commissioning at the Birmingham, Solihull and Black Country Area Team (NHS England) who are responsible for providing care for Sian, said they worked hard to ensure the best decisions were made.

'In exceptional cases where a condition becomes complicated by additional diagnoses, a different type of service may be appropriate for the patient.

'We work hard to ensure that this process is undertaken in a timely manner, however a careful balance has to be found to ensure that elements such as patient choice and clinical needs are taken into account.'
