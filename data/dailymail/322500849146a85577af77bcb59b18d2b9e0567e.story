The family of music legend Whitney Houston is furious that a reality show that began as a tribute to her has added to its cast the woman accused of fighting with the diva just hours before her death.

MailOnline has learned that Houston's family is outraged that former X Factor finalist Stacy Francis, 45, who had a public fight with Houston at a pre-Grammy Awards party in February 2012, has been tapped to join the cast of TV One's hit reality series, R&B Divas: LA.

This adds insult to injury, says a Houston insider, as the family of the late pop diva was already upset about Whitney's life being depicted in a biopic premiering on Lifetime next month.

MailOnline has learned that Whitney Houston's family is outraged that Former X Factor finalist Stacy Francis, who had an epic fight with Houston at a pre-Grammy Awards party in 2012, has been tapped to join the cast of TV One's hit reality series, R&B Divas: LA

Blood was running down Whitney's leg following the altercation with Stacy

Francis, 45, who  has never released her own CD and is still an aspiring solo artist, has joined the Los Angeles cast of this top-rated franchise, much to the chagrin of the Houston family

The show, made up of chart-topping singers Chrisette Michelle, Leela James, Lil Mo, Chanté Moore and Michel'le, is a spin-off of R&B Divas: Atlanta.

'The Houston family learned of this from one of the singers on the show and they're outraged! They were already furious about this upcoming Lifetime movie and now, they feel adding Stacy Francis to this show launched about Whitney is just another slap in the face,' a family friend tells MailOnline.

The altercation  between Houston and took place at a pre-Grammy party hosted by The Bodyguard star's friend, R&B singer Kelly Price at Tru Hollywood nightclub hours before she was found dead.

Houston's sister-in-law Pat Houston accused Francis of stalking the late singer during the party, saying she followed her around like an obsessed fan.

'She comes over and she says 'Hello,' but you keep seeing her. She [Whitney] didn't know her. She didn't know her from Adam,' she said of Francis in an interview with Oprah Winfrey following the altercation.

The X Factor contestant contends that she wasn't stalking Houston at the party, but that the two actually fought over the six-time Grammy winner's boyfriend, hip hop artist Ray J, after Houston saw them hugging.

In an interview with the Mirror following the incident, Francis claimed: 'Whitney came running over and said, 'You know Ray's my baby? Yeah, I'm a cougar girl'! I said, 'Whitney, I love you baby. It's not like that. Calm down, you're causing a scene.'

'There was a lot of alcohol there. She was doing shots. I saw her drink one before she went on stage to sing and then she had another one when she came off.'

Other singers who were at the party, including Price (who performed with Houston that night) and former Brownstone lead singer Gilbert, refuted Francis' version of events following the incident. They all backed up claims that the X Factor contestant was actually harassing Houston. 

Whitney Houston and Ray J were dating at the time for her death. The fight with Stacy was reportedly over him

In 2012, R&B Divas: Atlanta premiered on TV One and featured R&B stars Syleena Johnson, Faith Evans, Monifah Carter, KeKe Wyatt and Nicci Gilbert coming together to record a tribute album dedicated to Houston. 

The CD that derived from the show, R&B Divas, was nominated for a Grammy Award and the cast performed a memorial tribute to Houston in front of 70,000 people at the Essence Music Festival in New Orleans.

Now Francis, 45, who has never released her own CD and is an aspiring solo artist, has joined to Los Angeles cast of this top-rated franchise, much to the chagrin of the Houston family.

Additionally, Francis went on a media tour following Houston's death and told her account of their altercation. The Houston family accused her of trying to profit from the singer's death and fans of the late entertainer vilified Francis on social media.

'Stacy definitely was trying to use her story about Whitney to get famous, the family felt,' says the insider.

The addition of Francis to the 'R&B Divas LA' cast is puzzling to the Houston family, as the other cast members on the show have had hit records and very successful recording careers. The Brooklyn-bred divorced mother of two only had mediocre success as part of a short-lived girl group called Ex-Girlfriend in the late 1980s.

'As far as Whitney's family is concerned, R&B Divas doesn't even exist to them anymore. They're hoping die hard Whitney fans don't tune in to watch it, the same way they hope they boycott the Lifetime biopic. They're tired of people disrespecting the legacy of a woman who gave this industry her all,' our source concluded.

Back in July, the singer's mother Cissy Houston told 'Entertainment Tonight' that the family was 'exhausted by the continuing misinformation and comments.' Despite the fact that Angela Bassett, who is directing the biopic, had a personal relationship with Houston when they worked on the 1995 film Waiting to Exhale, Cissy Houston said, 'No one connected with this movie knew Whitney or anything about her relationship with Bobby.'
