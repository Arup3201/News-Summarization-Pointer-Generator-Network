He may be one of the driving forces behind super-intelligent computers that could improve everything from space travel to electric cars, but Elon Musk has likened artificial intelligence to ‘summoning the demon’.

The Tesla and Space X founder has previously warned that the technology could someday be more harmful than nuclear weapons.

Speaking at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) AeroAstro Centennial Symposium last week, Musk described artificial intelligence  as our ‘biggest existential threat’.

The dangers of artificial intelligence: 42-year-old Elon Musk (pictured) has likened artificial intelligence to ‘summoning the demon’. The Tesla and Space X founder has previously warned that the technology could someday be more harmful than nuclear weapons

He said: ‘I think we should be very careful about artificial intelligence. If I had to guess at what our biggest existential threat is, it’s probably that. So we need to be very careful with artificial intelligence.

‘I’m increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight, maybe at the national and international level, just to make sure that we don’t do something very foolish.

‘With artificial intelligence we’re summoning the demon. You know those stories where there’s the guy with the pentagram, and the holy water, and … he’s sure he can control the demon? Doesn’t work out.’

In August, he warned that AI could to do more harm than nuclear weapons.

Tweeting a recommendation for a book by Nick Bostrom called Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies that looks at a robot uprising, he wrote: ‘We need to be super careful with AI. Potentially more dangerous than nukes.’

The book asks questions about how humanity will cope with super-intelligent computers and argues that humans are living in a computer simulation and not the ‘real’ world.

In a later tweet, Musk wrote: ‘Hope we're not just the biological boot loader for digital superintelligence. Unfortunately, that is increasingly probable.’

Mr Musk has previously claimed that a horrific ‘Terminator-like’ scenario could be created from research into artificial intelligence.

The 42-year-old is so worried, he is investing in AI companies, not to make money, but to keep an eye on the technology in case it gets out of hand.

In March, Mr Musk made an investment San Francisco-based AI group Vicarious, along with Mark Zuckerberg and actor Ashton Kutcher.

Mr Musk took to Twitter earlier this year (pictured) to warn against the development of intelligent machines. He seems to have been influenced by a book that argues humans are living in a simulation and not the ‘real’ world

Google has set up an ethics board to oversee its work in artificial intelligence.

The
 search giant has recently bought several robotics companies, along with
 Deep Mind, a British firm creating software that tries to help 
computers think like humans.

One
 of its founders warned artificial intelligence is  'number 1 risk for 
this century,' and believes it could play a part in human extinction

'Eventually,
 I think human extinction will probably occur, and technology will 
likely play a part in this,' DeepMind’s Shane Legg said in a recent 
interview.

Among all forms 
of technology that could wipe out the human species, he singled out 
artificial intelligence, or AI, as the 'number 1 risk for this century.'

The ethics board, revealed by web site The Information, is to ensure the projects are not abused.

Neuroscientist
 Demis Hassabis, 37, founded DeepMind two years ago
 with the aim of trying to help computers think like humans.

Vicarious’ ultimate aim is to build a ‘computer that thinks like a person…except it doesn’t have to eat or sleep’, according to the company's co-founder Scott Phoenix.

In an interview with CNBC, Musk said: ‘I think there is potentially a dangerous outcome there.’

‘There have been movies about this, you know, like Terminator,’ Musk continued. ‘There are some scary outcomes. And we should try to make sure the outcomes are good, not bad.’

Vicarious is currently attempting to build a program that mimics the brain’s neocortex.

The neocortex is the top layer of the cerebral hemispheres in the brain of mammals. It is around three millimetres thick and has six layers, each involved with various functions.

These include sensory perception, spatial reasoning, conscious thought, and language in humans.

According to the company’s website: ‘Vicarious is developing machine learning software based on the computational principles of the human brain.

‘Our first technology is a visual perception system that interprets the contents of photographs and videos in a manner similar to humans.

‘Powering this technology is a new computational paradigm we call the Recursive Cortical Network.’

In October 2013, the company announced it had developed an algorithm that ‘reliably’ solves modern Captchas - the world’s most widely used test of a machine’s ability to act human.

Stephen Hawking has warned that artificial intelligence has the potential to be the downfall of mankind. 'Success in creating AI would be the biggest event in human history,' he said writing in the Independent. 'Unfortunately, it might also be the last'

Captchas are used when filling in forms, for example, to make sure it’s not being completed by a bot. This prevents people programming computers to buy a bulk load of gig tickets, for example.

As well as Vicarious, Mr Musk was early investor in AI firm DeepMind, which was earlier this year acquired by Google for £400m ($678m).

Professor Stephen Hawking has also warned that humanity faces an uncertain future as technology learns to think for itself and adapt to its environment.

Earlier this year, the renowned physicist discusses Johnny Depp's latest film Transcendence, which delves into a world where computers can surpass the abilities of humans.

Professor Hawking said dismissing the film as science fiction could be the ‘worst mistake in history’.
