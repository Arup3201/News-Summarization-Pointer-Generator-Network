Northern Ireland's First Minister Peter Robinson was backed by Muslim leaders after making a grovelling private apology over controversial remarks about Islam.

The DUP leader publicly backed a fundamentalist preacher who attacked Islam as a 'doctrine spawned in hell' and said he did not trust them.

Mr Robinson said he would not trust Muslims to give him religious advice - but insisted he would be okay with them 'going down the shops' for him.

Northern Ireland's First Minister Peter Robinson sparked fury after backing a pastor who said he did not trust Muslims in Britain

He said: 'I wouldn't trust Muslims who are following Sharia Law to the letter and neither would he.

'However, as I have said in many of the normal daily activities of life, I would have no difficulty in trusting Muslims to go down to the shop for me.'

The remarks sparked fury in Northern Ireland - but Mr Robinson insisted his words had been 'misinterpreted' and said he would never wish to insult or upset Muslims. 

Despite refusing to apologise in public, Muslim leaders in Northern Ireland said Mr Robinson did say sorry to them in private.

A spokesman for the Belfast Islamic Centre, Dr Raied Al-Wazzan said: 'We accepted the apology in private and for us that was a sincere apology and we accepted it.'

A further statement issued by the DUP after the meeting said Mr Robinson was willing to apologise to anyone who had been hurt or distressed by his comments.

A party spokesman said the meeting had been 'valuable, friendly and relaxed'.

'Mr Robinson outlined his views and made it clear that there was never any intention on his part to offend or cause distress to anyone.

'He said that if anyone interpreted his remarks in that way that he would apologise to them and that he would welcome the opportunity to continue conversations at the Belfast Islamic Centre.

'The First Minister recalled his previous help and support for the Islamic community and indicated that his support was ongoing.

'Mr Robinson reiterated the important role that the Islamic community has played in Northern Ireland, particularly in businesses, education and medicine.'

Pastor James McConnell sparked fury after claiming Islam was 'spawned in hell'. But his right to criticise religion was defended by the First Minister Peter Robinson

Dr Al-Wazzan described the meeting as 'thoughtful, very honest and open'. 'We have told him what we felt,' he said.

Mr Robinson sparked a storm of criticism after publicly backing anti-Islamic evangelical preacher Pastor James McConnell.

Mr McConnell, who is a fundamentalist Protestant preacher at the Whitewell Metropolitan Tabernacle Church in north Belfast, branded Islam a heathen doctrine during a fiery address to his congregation.

'People say there are good Muslims in Britain - that may be so - but I don’t trust them,' said the pastor. 'Islam is heathen, Islam is satanic, Islam is a doctrine spawned in hell.'

Police are currently investigating the contentious sermon made by Mr McConnell to see if its contents constituted a hate crime.

Mr Robinson’s subsequent comments in a newspaper interview that he himself would not trust Muslims for spiritual guidance but would trust them to 'go down the shops' sparked fury.

The DUP leader, who has attended Pastor McConnell’s church in the past, told the Irish News that claiming not to trust one section of society was not a hate crime, adding: 'If it is then I’m going straight away to the police to ask them to take action against all those who say they don’t trust politicians.'

The controversy erupted at a time when race hate attacks in Northern Ireland are on the increase.

Under mounting pressure over the issue, Mr Robinson went on the front foot, first issuing his statement of clarification and then embarking on a round of media interviews.

The statement said his original remarks had been 'misinterpreted and given a meaning that was never intended'.

He again defended Pastor McConnell’s right to free speech, but stressed: 'I would never seek to cause any insult to any section of our community.

'For the avoidance of any doubt, I make it clear that I welcome the contribution made by all communities in Northern Ireland and, in the particular circumstances, the Muslim community.'

He added: 'No part of me would want to insult or cause distress to local Muslims.'

Later, the First Minister claimed that comments in the original newspaper interview that he would not trust Muslims who followed Sharia law to the letter, alluding to violent punishments, or those involved in terrorism would be supported by the majority of people in the Western world.

He said: 'On all the everyday aspects of life (I would trust them), I specifically also mentioned that if I was going in for an operation and the surgeon was Muslim, would I trust him - of course I would.

'The actual comment about going to the shops was very much on the basis of saying that it was absurd that you wouldn’t trust people to do anything.'

He added: 'I defend people’s right, whether they are from the Protestant faith, the Catholic faith or Muslim faith, to be able to comment and, if they feel it necessary, to criticise other doctrines. 

'It would be a lack of freedoms if we were not allowing people to do so.'
