Hackers are playing on the public's fear of a terrorist attack in Sydney by circulating a fake email that claims to reveal locations that ISIS plans to attack in 2015.

Instead, the emails contain an attachment that downloads a malicious code which allows the attackers to gain access to and control their victim's computers and potentially steal various passwords.

The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) released a warning against the fake emails, which contain the subject line 'ISIS attacks in Sydney?' after receiving almost 100 reports from recipients on Sunday.

Hackers have been circulating an email claiming to list locations in Sydney that are under threat from ISIS 

'We have had just under 100 emails reported to us by members of the Australian public. How many are in circulation we are unsure, but we would expect, based on those numbers, that they have been widely circulated,' Bruce Matthews, the manager of internet security programs at ACMA, told Daily Mail Australia.

'These emails encourage people to open an attached Word or RAR file by claiming the attachment includes an article naming the Sydney locations ISIS plans to attack in 2015,' the statement reads.

ACMA also warned that the hackers have included the contact details of news website news.com.au in an effort to appear legitimate.

The email's body reads: 'ISIS has warned Australian Police today about new attacks in Sydney. 

'Attached the places in word file which ISIS planning to attack in Sydney this year 2015. 

 Instead, the emails contain an attachment that downloads a malicious code which allows the attackers to gain access to and control their victim's computers

The Australian Communications and Media Authority have released the body of the text as above

'These terrorists have Australian Citizen why they attack us? Read more in the detailed story in word file.'

Mr Matthews said that the cyber criminal's mention of ISIS was a common tactic and a form of social engineering.

'It happens whenever there's a topical event – the Malaysian Airlines incident, Ebola outbreak, tsunamis and Boston bombings – it's a very common tactic and its intention is to encourage or entice people to open emails and attachments that otherwise they wouldn't often open,' he said. 

ACMA has implored that any recipients of the email delete it immediately and avoid clicking on any attachments included.

The circulation of the email has come as many Sydney residents remain shaken following the Martin Place siege by gunman Man Haron Monis which left two people dead

Hacking in the name of ISIS has been a common theme over the last few days: This screen grab made Monday, January 12, 2015 show the front page of the US Central Command twitter account after is was hacked

The circulation of the email has come as many Sydney residents remain shaken following the Martin Place siege by gunman Man Haron Monis which left two people dead.

Australia's terror alert remains at level 'high', meaning a terrorist attack is 'likely', with Prime Minister Tony Abbott recently stating that 'there has been a heightened level of terrorist chatter in the aftermath of the Martin Place siege'.

Hacking in the name of ISIS has been a common theme over the last few days, with the social media accounts of the US military's central command appearing to have been taken over by sympathisers on Monday.

One of the messages posted to CentCom's Twitter account, which had its profile and banner pictures changed to show a masked jihadi with the words 'I love you ISIS', read: 'In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, the CyberCaliphate continues its CyberJihad.'

The hackers also shared propaganda videos on the account and made death threats against American soldiers. 

Mr Matthews encouraged anyone who wants to protect their computer to visit the government's Stay Smart Online website.
