It’s not quite a feat to match Harry Houdini, but it’s not for want of trying.

A man arrested outside a bar in Austin, Texas, during the SXSW (South By Southwest) festival was filmed making a brazen bid for freedom – after being handcuffed and made to lie on the floor.

Undeterred by the fact that he was unable to use his hands and lying next to several police officers, the man struggles to his feet while they are tackling two people nearby and sprints off through a watching crowd.

The footage begins with the man, dressed in red shorts and a grey T-shirt, lying handcuffed outside a pub called the Blind Tiger Pub on Sixth Street.

A few yards away four police officers, two with Tasers drawn, are busy trying to detain two men.

The man in the red shorts spots an opportunity to make a bid for freedom and after a couple of stumbles, manages to get to his feet with his hands tied behind his back and a black bag looped around his arms.

As he runs out of shot a police officer spots that he’s bolted and makes to give chase.

Even when the handcuffed man in red shorts has struggled to his knees, the police officers remain oblivious

The escapee suspect was later charged with evading arrest, according to Opposingviews.com

Police attended the scene amid reports of a fight.

The festival saw Miley Cyrus take to the stage on Thursday. She made a surprise appearance at music producer and rapper Mike Will Made-It’s performance at Fader Fort.
