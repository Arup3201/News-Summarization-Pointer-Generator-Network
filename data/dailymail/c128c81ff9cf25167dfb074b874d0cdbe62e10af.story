Sri Lanka have selected key fast bowler Lasith Malinga - 'subject to fitness' - for their World Cup squad.

Malinga was unavailable for Sri Lanka's 5-2 one-day international series victory over England late last year as he continued his recovery from ankle surgery.

He has been named, however, alongside fit-again seamer Nuwan Kulasekara in a final 15 for the global tournament in Australia and New Zealand, which gets under way next month.

The squad also contains veteran pair Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene, back-to-form ex-captain Dinesh Chandimal and controversial off-spinner Sachithra Senanayake.

Sri Lanka will complete their World Cup preparations with a seven-match ODI series against New Zealand, starting this week.
