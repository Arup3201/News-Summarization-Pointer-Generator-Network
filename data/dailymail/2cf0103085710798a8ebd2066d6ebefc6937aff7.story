But he added: ‘Look at the talent. He’s at a stage in his career where this is his chance. I’ve worked with those types of players all my life in youth coaching where I’ve never had the finished article.

‘He needs to be consistent and if he can do that he will be one hell of a player. Most players I like to look in their eye and see honesty and humility.

‘We went three-and-a-half hours talking it through. He’s at a massive club. We can help him improve his game - he’s a very bright boy and he knows this is his last chance.

‘I’m excited to work with him and improve him as a footballer as well as a person.’
