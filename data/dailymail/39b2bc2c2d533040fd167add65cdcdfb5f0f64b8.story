The teenage pizza delivery boy who allegedly raped a 35-year-old woman while she slept next to her seven-year-old daughter, confessed his crime in a barely readable note, police revealed.

Cesar Lucas, 16, today pleaded not guilty to rape and burglary as police released the handwritten letter, signed by the teen on the night of the alleged rape.

The accused described ‘a type of disea’ which made him enter the victim’s flat after midnight on September 29.

Charged: Delivery boy Cesar Lucas, 16, has pleaded not guilty to rape in court but confessed to 'sexual intercorse' with the 35-year-old in a handwritten note release by police

Cesar Lucas was working as a delivery boy for his father who owns Sal’s Pizza in the same Manhattan neighbourhood as the woman’s luxury apartment building.

He was delivering a pizza to the next-door flat when he noticed that the door was slightly ajar and entered the apartment.

He sexually assaulted the woman, who was sleeping in her bed with her daughter, police said.

‘I screamed,’ the 35-year-old victim told the New York Daily News.

‘It took him about 30 seconds. I said, “Get off of me,” and I pushed him. He said “I’m sorry,” and ran out,’ she said.

On the stand: Cesar was delivering pizza to a neighbour in the 35-year-old woman's luxury condo complex in Manhattan when he attacked her as she slept next to her seven-year-old daughter

Lucas was picked up by police at Sal's Pizza a short time later and charged with rape and burglary. He allegedly told police he was 'feeling horny'.

‘Cesar got type of disea in a way he never had felted before,’ the poorly written note reads. ‘I unrap her from all the coushing she had on top of her. She also started to feel horny, you can say,’

Continuing to refer to himself in the third person, Lucas Cesar then describes the sexual assault, claiming he had sexual intercourse with her for two minutes before leaving the apartment – but not before rummaging through her daughter’s purse and stealing $20, according to the New York Post.

The 16-year-old also claims the woman was ‘completely drunk’

‘I really was pretty scare because she was drunk and I kind ah took advantage of her.’

Appearing at Manhattan Supreme Court today, Lucas Cesar kept his head down and stared at the table in front of him until he was asked to plea.

He briefly lifted his head to speak the words ‘Not guilty’.

Disturbing: The 16-year-old was on a delivery for his father's restaurant Sal's Pizza

Upon his arrest in the early hours of the 29th September, Cesar Lucas initially denied raping the woman, but admitted he had broken into the flat

‘What's going on? Why are you arresting me? I've been arrested before for the same thing. I broke into an apartment. It's still pending. I have to go to court,’ he said according to police statements released to the New York Post.

Lucas was referring to his arrest in August for breaking into a 39-year-old woman's apartment while making a delivery and stealing her wallet.

He was charged with burglary, criminal possession of stolen credit cards and theft of service, to which he has pleaded not guilty

Lucas was taken into custody on September 29 where he eventually made the horrific and grammatically appalling confession to rape.

He put all the blame on his ‘disea’, adding in the note that ‘Cesar didn't realized what kind of things he was about to do or make,’

He is back in court January 22.
