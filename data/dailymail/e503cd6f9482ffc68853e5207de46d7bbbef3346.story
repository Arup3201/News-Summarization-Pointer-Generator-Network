It may have been the slowest chase ever when a tortoise attempted to run down a television presenter who interrupted it having sex with its mate.

Paul Rose - who hosts National Geographic's Pristine Seas - was on Assumption Island, north of Madagascar, when he heard an animal call, which he described as a 'blowing sound'. 

As he walked towards the strange noise, it soon became apparent Rose and his cameraman had stumbled upon a male and female tortoise mating.

Television host Paul Rose was chased by a male tortoise after he interrupted it mating with a female tortoise

The pair were more than 180 metres from where the presenter initially heard the noise.

As Rose and his cameraman stop and try to observe the ritual, the giant tortoises stop mating.

The presenter said he did not know whether or not they had stopped because of their close proximity or they had finished.

The animals are seen touching noses as Rose and his cameraman watch from behind bushes.

He was on Assumption Island - north of Madagascar - when the incident happened during filming

Rose and his cameraman were there taping for his National Geographic show, Pristine Seas

The host heard a 'blowing sound' while he was walking the island and went towards, discovering the tortoises

Almost immediately the male tortoise spots them and slowly begins to turn himself around, pointing himself in the direction of the television crew.

The animal then starts to make its way towards them, with as much gusto as it can muster.

Rose is heard telling his cameraman, 'Don't move', as it becomes apparent the tortoise is after them.

As the reptile gets closer and closer to the camera, he shows no sign of stopping and so the cameraman jumps back.

What ensues is a very low speed chase where the tortoise tries to defend his territory and take a bite out of Rose.

The male tortoise slowly turned around to start running after the pair who were startled by the move

Humouring the reptile, Rose continued to slowly back away from it instead of running, observing its behaviour

Rose said it was the male tortoise's way of protecting his territory and getting him away from the female

Later, the host said the tortoise had ended up chasing them for about 365 metres in a circle

'This is the male saying, "Hey I think you've interrupted my mating session",' Rose told the audience as the tortoise inches closer.

'You can't blame him he's in the bushes over there mating on this beautiful, private island and I pitch up to take a look.' 

Rose continued to humour the tortoise instead of running away.

He said it was completely relentless in his pursuit, chasing them around in a 365-metre-loop.
