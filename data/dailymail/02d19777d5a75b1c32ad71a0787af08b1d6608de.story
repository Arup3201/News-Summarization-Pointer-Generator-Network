A California man has fallen 1,000 feet to his death in a paragliding accident while his teenage daughter, who was flying in tandem with him, survived.

Veterinarian Ronald Faoro, 60, died after witnesses say he fell from his glider and landed in a steep canyon area on Sunday morning.

Faoro's daughter, 16-year-old Sierra, stayed strapped into the glider and eventually crashed into a mountain about a quarter of a mile from where her father's body was found.

Sierra, who was not an experienced pilot, suffered only minor injuries and was lifted out by helicopter and flown to a nearby hospital.

According to the Santa Barbara County Fire Department, Faoro was not adequately clipped in to the harness and during the course of the ride, he became detached and fell to his death.

A UC Santa Barbara Geology Department field trip group was in the area and witnessed the accident.

Members of the group were helpful in locating the victims and when rescue teams declared Faoro dead upon arrival.

The coroner's office is investigating the accident to determine how it happened.

Dr. Faoro owned and had worked at the St. Francis Pet Clinic in Santa Barbara since the early 1980s, reports Noozhawk.

Authorities believe Faoro - who was an avid paraglider, was not adequately clipped in to the harness and during the course of the ride, he became detached and fell to his death

Dr. Faoro owned and had worked at the St. Francis Pet Clinic in Santa Barbara since the early 1980s, while daughter Sierra survived the ordeal with only minor injuries

'It is with great sadness that we mourn the loss of Dr. Ron Faoro,' the clinic said in a statement.

'He was an amazing veterinarian, clinic owner, mentor and friend. At this time the family and staff has requested privacy as they struggle to handle this sudden and unexpected loss.'

He lived locally with his wife, Elizabeth, and daughter, Sierra. According to his Facebook page, Faoro was an avid paraglider. 

Paragliding resembles a combination of hang-gliding and skydiving, where a pilot launches on foot and sits below a fabric wing that catches the wind.

Faoro's death was the first paragliding fatality in the Santa Barbara area since 1978.

It is a ​mecca for free-flying with people coming from all over the world to train and fly there.
