A record low attendance at the new Wembley could greet England against Norway on Wednesday night, but the game has plenty to offer.

It is the first time the Three Lions have played since the World Cup in Brazil, with Roy Hodgson keen to spark a revival. And that's not all.

Here are three reasons why you should be watching the game.

Thinking time: Roy Hodgson and England are preparing for the test Norway will present at Wembley Stadium

WAYNE ROONEY

It will be the first game in his official role as captain and Rooney will win his 96th England cap. 

The best player of his generation will lead the new era. 

He is on course to win his 100th cap against Slovenia at the age of 29.

Fresh start: Wayne Rooney is the new captain of England and will hope to impress on his 96th appearance

RAHEEM STERLING

Raised in the shadow of Wembley Stadium, Sterling has emerged as one of the brightest and most exciting talents in European football in the last 12 months, on an accelerated development curve. 

He is the gem Hodgson’s new team must be designed to showcase.

A NEW BEGINNING

Jack Colback is injured but there may be first caps for Danny Rose, Fabian Delph and Calum Chambers and one of these opportunities might just be the start of something new and exciting.
