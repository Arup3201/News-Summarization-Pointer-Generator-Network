Kidnapping survivor Elizabeth Smart and her husband have revealed that they want to start a family.

Smart's husband Matthew Gilmour spoke out for the first time ever as part of the hour-long special about his wife's kidnapping 11 years ago.

The Scotsman married Elizabeth in August of last year, and he opened up to Meredith Vieira during an NBC interview about how he had no idea about the nine-month ordeal that defined so much of his wife's childhood.

New beginnings: Smart married fellow Mormon Matthew Gilmour and he had never heard of her case until she told him all of the details herself

Strong: Gilmour said that when he learned of Elizabeth's past, he was surprised because he would have expected someone who went through that kind of terror to be depressed

The two met as they are both Mormons and he was in America as part of a trip with his church.

He said that he had never heard of her when they were first introduced, and she was the one to tell him about what had happened to her.

'I was surprised because like when I think of someone who's been through something like that, I would think they would be depressed so I was very surprised of how well she's overcome it,' she said.

The first addition to their family unit was their dog Archie who they were seen walking during the interview, and who Elizabeth took with her as she showed Vieira the remote campsite where her captors kept her for months.

Smart has showed great poise in the years following her 2003 rescue, especially lately as she has begun speaking to victims support groups and sharing the details of how she was raped on a daily basis by her captor in order to help raise awareness about sexual assault.

Elizabeth and Matthew also revealed to Meredith that they are thinking about starting a family, although for now she has been busy writing her book and giving inspirational speeches.

Smart, who is now 25, arranged the interview with Vieira in conjunction to the launch of her memoir, My Story.

She and Gilmour married in a traditional Mormon ceremony in Hawaii but he was sure to bring some of his Scottish ancestry to the proceedings by wearing a kilt.

The couple met while on their missionary year in France, were accompanied by about 12 family members and very close friends.
