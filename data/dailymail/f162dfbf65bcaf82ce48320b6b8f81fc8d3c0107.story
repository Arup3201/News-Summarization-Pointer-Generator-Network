Pressure: Former Prime Minister Tony Blair broke out in a sweat when quizzed about his relationship with Rupert Murdoch and his ex-wife, Wendi Deng

Tony Blair is one of the great alpha politicians this country has produced: a conviction politician who is not afraid to take on big and contentious issues and does not mind a challenge.

Yet he remains a puzzle – even to those of us sympathetic to his deft repositioning of the Labour Party, his reformist outlook on public services and his now-unfashionable commitment to Britain’s role in some of the most difficult issues the world faces: notably the rise of Islamic fundamentalism and its remedies.

Abroad, Mr Blair is a well-received (and often handsomely paid) speaker and consultant, both to private companies and a range of governments. A foundation he created does underpraised work educating youngsters in countries at risk of violent extremism about the benefits of open debate and tolerance.

Even his staunchest defenders, though, admit the former Labour leader has a severe image problem at home, where his reputation has been tarnished not only by the messy aftermath of the Iraq invasion and the framing of the case for war around Saddam Hussein’s missing WMD, but a more general doubt about his trustworthiness and a belief that his quest for the high life has embroiled him in entanglements and misjudgments.

It is a conundrum that was expressed all too clearly when I interviewed him twice recently on a wide range of subjects for The Economist – in particular in his now widely reported and nervous reaction to questions about Rupert Murdoch and his then wife Wendi Deng (the couple divorced earlier this year). Mr Blair did something that was overdue. He finally gave an answer to a straightforward question I put about whether he had ‘got into a mess’ with his relationship with Ms Deng.

There was a public falling-out this year between Mr Blair and the media mogul over colourful suspicions – first raised in The Mail on Sunday – that the former PM and Wendi had become unduly close. Friends of Mr Murdoch say that when he questioned Mr Blair about the relationship, he got only ‘politician’s answers’, which led to a long-standing political and personal friendship falling apart.

Mr Blair denies all impropriety. But many in his tight inner circle know that this is not the point. When I interviewed the former PM in his offices, an elegant suite in Grosvenor Square, close to the heavily guarded American Embassy, Mr Blair was, as usual, dashing between international appointments. His staff busied around to adjust his travel plans and find his elusive glasses.

I asked: Was this all a regrettable muddle, damaging to his reputation and worth clarifying?

Coolly, he replied that it was ‘not something I will ever talk about – I haven’t and I won’t’. There was an eye roll and a grin/grimace, then silence. And he was exercised enough to crash his coffee cup loudly into its saucer so that the whole room jumped.

Too close? There were colourful suspicions – first raised in The Mail on Sunday – that the former PM and Wendi (pictured) had become unduly close

He added: ‘It isn’t fair or right to go into that issue.’ But the subject did provoke one sign of alarm: a large, dark pool of sweat appeared suddenly under his armpit.

A trusted, mainly female staff keeps a close eye on press encounters, so after long negotiations, Julie Crowley, his quite stern press aide, and Catherine Rimmer, his highly valued – and usually cheery – adviser, sat in. 

Occasionally, there would be a sharp intake of breath, as when the Deng question came, but they never intervened, let alone sought to stop the encounter. I reckon that candour is the best tribute and that he can take it. Which he can.

I doubt that this was Mr Blair’s favourite moment, but the conversation continued cheerfully enough, along with a lot of jokes – people forget that Blair is amusing and quick on his feet. On another topic, he grew extremely animated, checked himself, and then clutched his head and sighed: ‘You have roused me to passion – as it were.’ He is a charmer and it would be fair to say that he knows it.

However, even his close friends acknowledge that the story harmed Mr Blair (not least financially, since Mr Murdoch ended his donations to the American branch of Mr Blair’s faith foundation and cut him off from other donors in America). Besides the irresistible interest in the lives of the rich and famous, the factor that annoyed Mr Murdoch so much was a sense that the former PM had not been straight with him.

True, some people (including Mr Blair’s fiercely protective staff) believe that all this is irrelevant at best, muck-raking at worst. I disagree, because such personal tales do give the rest of us some insight into how powerful people think and behave and where they have become entangled in their own odd logic. At 61, the trim and energetic former leader remains a fascinating figure. He has always combined a thespian lust for the limelight with a desire to be taken seriously in his political after-life.

But the tensions of morality and Mammon have also been glaring in his involvement in places such as Kazakhstan, where he has set up a team of advisers, counselling the government of Nursultan Nazarbayev on ‘policy development and governance’. A laudable aim – and lucrative work. Alas, it also entailed Mr Blair appearing in a video edited to look as if the former Labour leader were a fully paid-up supporter of a leader who has zero interest in democracy, oppresses political opponents, and which weasels about its responsibility for a massacre of workers in 2011.

The frustrating thing is that Mr Blair is surely right that moderate religion and engagement are vital to combat the evils of Islamic extremism. But the reasoning can get mighty tangled.

Backing Egypt’s ex-military President Sisi, who is showing more talent for locking up scores of opponents than reform, looks unlikely to solve the trade-off between security and religious freedoms in Egypt and beyond. A lot of things look different in the wake of Iraq, the failed Arab Spring and the kind of appalling fundamentalist brutality we saw in the slaying of children by the Taliban in Pakistan last week.

Mr Blair tries hard to make Western enterprise and statecraft work for the good. But there is also a maddening blend of shrewdness and insight with avoidances and self-justifications. It leaves him with a permanent pass to the First Class lounge—but in a moral no-man’s land, garlanded one minute and decried as a war criminal the next. Mr Blair is, as he conceded, the only man to be subjected to a ‘citizen’s arrest’ by a waiter while trying to order a salad.

I suspect that, for all the global glamour, commercial success and boundless self-belief, the most successful ex-Labour leader would like more credit and esteem at home. There is a frustration, even a loneliness about him, which cannot be dealt with by accumulating ever more clients and good causes.

Next year, the Chilcot Inquiry will be critical of his handling of the Iraq War – but will also present him with a chance to talk about his mistakes as well as his achievements.

He does not need to recant on his world-view, but he should show more openness about his failings and some regret for them.

Most of all, Mr Blair needs to deal with a weakness which has come to haunt him in public and private life – he needs to talk straight.
