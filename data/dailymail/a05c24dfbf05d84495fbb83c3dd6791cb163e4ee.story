A Virginia Beach mother is furious and her community perplexed after her daughter is suspended from middle school for taking a razor blade from a fellow student who was harming himself and throwing it away.

Adrionna Harris took the tiny X-ACTO blade from a boy last week and immediately threw it away and on Friday she reported the incident to administrators.

Instead of applauding her heroics, administrators suspended the sixth grader and are even threatening expulsion.

Shocking: Virginia Beach 6th grader Adrionna Harris briefly handled a razor blade in school as she snatched from a fellow student she says was trying to harm himself and threw it away. Now she's been suspended for 10 days

'I was shocked and surprised. I was very shocked that a student would get suspended for saving another child,' Adrionna's mother Rachael Harris told WAVY. 'The school system over-reached absolutely.'

Harris got nowhere when she called Bayside Middle School to understand the rationale behind her daughter's suspension.

All she knew was that it was Adrionna's own admission that got her suspended, which has young Adrionna more than a little confused.

'I took the razor blade, and then I threw it away immediately…I didn’t carry it around the school…I didn’t use it against anyone…I threw it away,' she said.

Adrionna's mother describes that 
moment as a '9-1-1 situation' and says there jsut wasn't time for her 
daughter to find a teacher.

'I
 felt she did the  right thing,' said Ms.Harris. 'Under the 
circumstances, she thought he would bleed out, as he was cutting 
himself, and there was no teacher in sight.'

'The school system over-reached absolutely': Her mother Rachael Harris believes the school went too far in enforcing its zero tolerance policy

No answers: Adrionna's mother tried calling the school for days but they refused to return her calls. A reporter holds up an example of the X-Acto style blade at question in the case.

The sitatuation felt so serious to Adrionna that even in retrospect she says she would do it all over again.

'Even if I got in trouble, it didn’t matter because I was helping him…I would do it again even if I got suspended, yes,' she said.

After none of Ms. Harris's calls to the school were returned, the determined mother turned to her local NBC affiliate.

When reporters began making calls themselves, school officials suddenly contacted the Harris.

While Adrionna was originally slated to have to wait out her 10-day suspension before her case, and possible expulsion, were reviewed, they got a call to move the meeting up to Thursday.

Rachael Harris hopes it will result in a reversal of the school's decision to punish her daughter.

'It is amazing. They are listening to us now…she should be back in school tomorrow and that would be fair,' she said.

Once both Ms. Harris and their local news station were making calls, the school suddenly agreed to move up a meeting about Adrionna's potential expulsion to Thursday
