Segolene Royal reignited her row with the French First Lady last night when she blamed Valerie Trierweiler for her presidential election defeat to Nicolas Sarkozy.

The pair had becomed embroiled in a political spat last week when it emerged that Miss Trierweiler had tweeted support for a politician standing against Miss Royal, 58, in parliamentary elections.

A presidential aide said Miss Trierweiler, 47 – nicknamed the Rottweiler – had since been told to ‘stay in the shadows’ because president Francois Hollande was ‘furious’ at her intervention.

But the row dubbed the 'the war of the
roses' erupted again last night when Miss Royal, who said she was 
'wounded' by the 'violent blow', claimed Miss Trierweiler had been 
undermining her career for years since starting a relationship with her 
ex-partner.

Miss Segolene, the mother of President
Hollande's four children, had already accused senior Socialist 
politicians of not being supportive enough in her 2007 campaign.

But she went a step further in an 
interview with French weekly Le Point yesteryday, claiming France's 
first lady had kept Mr Hollande away from her during the campaign.

She said: 'I realise that in 2007 (Mr 
Hollande's affair with Trierweiler) can't have helped matters. I now 
understand why François didn't help me.

'In 2007, I said to myself: 'It will pass, it'll work itself out.' So I took it on the chin.'

Miss Royal is said to have told friends that Miss Trierweiler is a 'traitor' who her treated her disgracefully.

Ms Trierweiler took to Twitter to announce her support for socialist Olivier Falorni

Miss Royal said it was unfair that 
Miss Trierweiler had been allowed to carry on writing about Mr Hollande 
in her 'Paris Match' arts column.

Miss Royal told Le Point: 'In an 
Anglo-Saxon country, she would have been fired the same day. But Paris 
Match was not unhappy to see me weakened, so they let (the relationship)
go on deliberately, just like all those others who knew ...(Paris Match
owner) Lagardère, Sarkozy.'

Her outburst finished when she claimed that 'I'm the one whose family has been broken, I'm, the one who should bear a grudge.'

France's first lady said last night she regretted humiliating the mother of the president’s four children.

Mr Hollande, who lived with Miss Royal
for 30 years, wanted to make her the speaker of the National Assembly 
but backed down when she lost the election.

Telling off: Following Valerie Trierweiler's (pictured right) Twitter comments, Prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said 'everyone should know their place'

A friend of Miss Trierweiler said she admitted: ‘I made a mistake.’ The friend added: ‘She did not calculate the consequences.’

Ms Trierweiler, who has been divorced 
twice, has three sons of her own and said that the only reason she had 
not travelled to Mexico with Hollande for the G8 meeting was because 
they have exams this week.

Intriguingly, Ms Trierweiler's 
personal biography has disappeared from the Elysee Palace website, but 
another aide insisted that it was 'being edited' and would return.

But the same aide confirmed that Ms 
Trierweiler was being encouraged to 'remain in the shadows'  because Ms 
Hollande was 'furious' at the way she has behaved so far.

Referring to the tweet, he said 'clearly this cannot happen again'.

Despite the continuing saga which has 
reduced the Elysee to a soap opera, journalist Ms Trierweiler's arts 
column is set to appear in Paris Match magazine this week.

And she has insisted she will not give up her Twitter account.

Mr Hollande has now refused to give Ms Royal a job because she lost the La Rochelle seat in western France so heavily.

But, despite consistent defeats since 
being rejected for the presidency in 2007, Ms Royal insists that she can
revive her political career.
