Spectacular pictures of the Sun's 90-mile high solar eruptions have been captured in the highest ever resolution by NASA scientists.

The images of the star's outer atmosphere provide evidence of magnetic 'braids' believed to heat this region up to four million degrees Celsius.

They occur when small bundles of magnetic field become wrapped around each other because of the swirling of plasma on the Sun's surface.

The new study published in Nature shows these dynamic 90-mile high structures provide the energy to heat the sun's corona.

It is now apparent there are at least two heating mechanisms at work including a process known as electromagnetic waves that penetrate the plasma and transfer their energy to the constituent particles.

But additional heating needed for corona to become superheated is caused by the unravelling and reformation of the magnetic braids.

This theory is supported by the observations made by astrophysicist Dr Jonathan Cirtain, of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Centre in Alabama, and colleagues.

They used the High-resolution Coronal Imager (Hi-C) launched on a rocket last July that obtained roughly five minutes of data before re-entering Earth's atmosphere.

The extreme-ultraviolet telescope looks at coronal plasma with temperatures of around 1.5 million degrees Celsius - and has a resolution five times higher than previously achieved.

Dr Cirtain said the magnetic braids in an active region of the corona are seen to be reconnecting, relaxing and dissipating sufficient energy to heat the structures to 4million degrees celsius.

He said: 'It is now apparent there are at least two heating mechanisms in the Sun's outer atmosphere or corona'.

'Wave heating may be the prevalent mechanism in quiet solar periods and may contribute to heating the corona to 1.500,000 Celsius.

'The active corona needs additional heating to reach 2,000,000-4,000,000 C - this heat has been theoretically proposed to come from the reconnection and unravelling of magnetic 'braids'.

'Here we report observations of magnetic braids in a coronal active region that are reconnecting, relaxing and dissipating sufficient energy to heat the structures to about 4,000,000C.

'Although our 5-minute observations cannot unambiguously identify the field reconnection and subsequent relaxation as the dominant heating mechanism throughout active regions, the energy available from the observed field relaxation in our example is ample for the observed heating.'

Space scientist Professor Peter Cargill, of Imperial College London, reviewed the study for the journal and said there is 'a wealth of data' to be analysed even from five minutes of observations.

He said: 'The next stage is securing Hi-C, or an instrument with similar or improved performance, on an orbiting spacecraft.

'This spacecraft must also carry a modern extreme-ultraviolet spectrometer - both to complement Hi-C and to provide fundamental plasma measurements of density, temperature, velocities and small-scale turbulence - as well as an instrument capable of measuring signatures of energetic particles, which are known to be a significant product of the magnetic-reconnection process.

'Only with such complete instrumentation can a proper understanding of coronal structures be attained.'
