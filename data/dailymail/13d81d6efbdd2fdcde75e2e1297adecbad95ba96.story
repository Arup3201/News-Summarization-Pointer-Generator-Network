Iago Aspas has joined Sevilla on a season-long loan from Liverpool with an additional option to make the deal permanent next summer.

The 26-year-old had a poor season at Anfield since joining Liverpool for £7.7million from Celta Vigo last year, and chief executive Ian Ayre has been keen to usher Aspas to the exit.

Liverpool wanted rid of Aspas on a permanent basis if they could reclaim a fair amount of their original fee, and have included a clause that allows Sevilla to do just that for £5m next summer.

On the move: Iago Aspas has joined La Liga outfit Sevilla on a season-long loan deal from Liverpool

Struggle: The Liverpool forward had a difficult debut season at the club, scoring just once in 15 games

BORN: Moana, Spain, Aug 1 1987 (age 26)

2006-2009: Celta B (84 apps, 11 gls)

2008-2013: Celta (136, 46)

2013-NOW: Liverpool (14, 0)

2014-NOW: Sevilla (loan) (0, 0)

The move back to his homeland should 
allow the Spanish striker more time on the pitch in La Liga than he was given in the Premier League.

The loan compromise was struck between Ayre and Sevilla president, Jose Castro.

A statement read: 'Sevilla FC and Liverpool FC have reached (on Monday) a tentative agreement for the loan with an option to purchase the player Iago Aspas, who will wear the shirt of Sevilla FC for season 14/15.

'At the end of the campaign Sevilla FC may exercise a clause to purchase him for three seasons with an option for a fourth.'

Aspas' career at Liverpool began well enough, starting their opening Premier League game and providing the assist for Daniel Sturridge in the 1-0 win over Stoke.

But things quickly went downhill from there, as he went on to make just 14 more appearances all season, scoring once against Oldham Athletic in the FA Cup.

Liverpool had been keen to offer Aspas as part of a deal to secure target Alberto Moreno.
