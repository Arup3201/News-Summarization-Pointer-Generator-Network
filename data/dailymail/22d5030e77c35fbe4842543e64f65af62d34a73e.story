Walkies in the park just doesn't cut it for this daredevil pooch. 

Riley the dog stunned onlookers when he took his daily exercise at 13,000ft by jumping out an aeroplane  strapped to his adrenalin-junkie owner.

The four-year old Dachshund completed his first ever skydive with owner Nathan Batiste, 38, who claimed it was the best jump he's ever experienced.

Nathan, a photographer from San Francisco, has made more than 400 jumps in his lifetime but this was the first time he had taken his canine companion along.

The four-year old Dachshund completed his first ever skydive with keen freefaller Nathan Batiste, 38

Strapped to the chest of his owner, four-year-old Riley jumped out of the aeroplane at 13,000ft

Nathan, a photographer from San Francisco, has made more than 400 jumps in his lifetime but this was the first time he had taken his canine companion along

The little dog was kitted out with his very own pair of doggles for the jump and strapped to his owner's chest.

Nathan said: 'It was by far the most enjoyable skydive I've ever done and Riley seemed to love it too - I'll definitely be taking him again.

'My favourite part of the experience was the canopy ride - petting him and watching him look out intently at the horizon was something else.

'Then we landed and everybody was on the ground giving each other high fives and petting Riley - it really made everyone's day.

Nathan said Riley seemed to love the experience and he would definitely be taking the pooch along again

Nathan, and his partner, Amy Yopp, adopted Riley as a puppy from a local shelter and took him to the drop zone of the skydive site for walks, where he became a firm favourite among the skydive team

All the skydiving team loved having Riley up in the air with them for the jump

'Our other dog Kiki would have hated it but I always had a gut-feeling that Riley would enjoy it.

'Riley is very calm and very trusting when he's with me and everybody got a kick out of it.

'It was a magical experience and one I'll never forget.'

Nathan kitted Riley out with special custom-made 'doggles' so he could join his owner up in the air

'It was a magical experience and one I'll never forget': Nathan and Riley loved their first jump together

Nathan, who has done more than 400 jumps, said it was one of the best decisions of his life to start skydiving

The tiny pooch enjoyed greeting his owner at every landing and Nathan decided to kit out Riley so he could join in with the experience.

He said: 'I've been skydiving since 2009 and when me and my girlfriend Amy adopted Riley from a shelter I decided to take him to the drop zone for walks.

'Everyone loved him there and he became a favourite in no time.

Riley previously had to wait at the bottom of the skydive to greet his owner after a jump

Nathan said Riley is very calm and  trusting when he's with him so he was confident he would enjoy the jump

'I had a funny feeling that Riley would enjoy skydiving so I asked a friend to design a custom-made harness for him.

'I also ordered him a pair of 'doggles' as I like to call them and we were all set to go.

'It really was great fun and the footage of Riley looking around once I'd opened the chute is awesome.

'It's been one of the best decisions of my life to get involved in skydiving and I'm looking forward to many more jumps with Riley.'

Nathan was particularly pleased with the footage of the pair during the tandem skydive

Riley seemed to enjoy the experience as much as his adrenalin-junkie owner

When the pair landed everybody was on the ground giving each other high fives and petting Riley
