Roberto Martinez deemed Papiss Cisse’s elbow on Seamus Coleman ‘unacceptable’ and stressed the Newcastle United striker deserved to be sent off.

Cisse scored Newcastle’s equaliser in the 3-2 win three minutes after referee Craig Pawson failed to punish the Senegal international for elbowing the Everton defender during a set piece.

Martinez slammed Cisse for ‘elbowing a fellow professional’ and insisted Newcastle should have been down to 10 men before they made it 1-1 in the 34th minute.

Asked whether Cisse should have been on the pitch to get Newcastle back into the game, Martinez said: ‘No he shouldn’t.

‘I don’t want to see players sent off for different rules or the laws of the game, but it’s unacceptable that action from Papiss Cisse.

‘You don’t want to see that on a football pitch. That shouldn’t be allowed. Two players fighting for their position in a dead ball situation and you end up deciding to take the law by elbowing a fellow professional.

‘It’s unacceptable. That should have been a red card. Actions like that should not be allowed on the football pitch.’

Cisse made it 1-1 before goals from Ayoze Perez and Jack Colback sealed the 3-2 win for Newcastle, ending a four-match run of defeats in all competitions.
