Liverpool were given a welcome they're unlikely to forget after Besiktas fans took it upon themselves to make the visitors as uncomfortable as possible.

Brendan Rodgers's side were greeted at the Atatürk Olympic Stadium with a loud and intimidating atmosphere as the Turkish fans made it clear the opposition wouldn't get an easy ride.

But even before the game, the pre-match mind games had started when Besiktas supporters decided to honk their horns outside Liverpool's hotel on Wednesday night, in attempt to disrupt their English counterparts.

'Welcome to Hell' is how they wanted to make Brendan Rodgers' side feel during the second leg clash 

Liverpool's players were kept awake by honking of car horns from the Besiktas fans on Wednesday night 

The police were called to the Wyndham Hotel in Istanbul, and they were able to put a stop the racket created by Turkish side's fans.

Banners such as 'Welcome to Hell' and 'Liverpool You'll Walk Alone Here' were displayed just before kick-off as Slaven Bilic's side attempted to overcome the 1-0 deficit. 

Their disruption techniques may well have worked as Liverpool lost on penalties, with Dejan Lovren missing the decisive spot-kick in a shootout that Besiktas won 5-4.
