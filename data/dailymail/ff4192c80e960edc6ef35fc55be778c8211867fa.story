Put that midriff away!

They may be oh-so-fashionable, but Melbourne racegoers have been warned some will run afoul of the rules if they wear croptops to Flemington this Spring. 

Fashionistas headed to the Melbourne Cup may have to re-evaluate their wardrobe if they are partying in the Member's Enclosure, as tight fashion regulations will be in place.

Skin: Charli Robinson shared a modest amount of midriff at Oaks Day last year

'Visible midriff garments', shorts and denim wear are banned, Victoria Racing Club said in a statement to Daily Mail Australia.

But the strict rules will not apply to many punters, the club said. 

'General admission racegoers at the Melbourne Cup Carnival do not have to adhere to VRC Members’ Enclosure dress regulations,' a statement said.

The Melbourne Cup falls on November 4 this year. 

Would Jennifer Hawkins (above) escape the slight midrift display at Derby Day in 2010?
