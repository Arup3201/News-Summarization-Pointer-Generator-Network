Ahead of Apple’s launch event tomorrow, new leaked images reveal the clearest signs yet of how the rumoured 4.7-inch iPhone 6 will look and work. 

As well as showcasing the new handset’s thickness, compared to the iPhone 5S, and its larger screen, a modified Passbook icon on the homepage reveals more clues about Apple’s iWallet plans.

Previous leaks have only shown diagrams, or the phone’s individual component parts.

The images were posted on Chinese social media site Weibo by user @Jimas1994. The pictures reportedly reveal the 4.7-inch handset - due to launch tomorrow  - with an updated Passbook icon seen on the homepage (pictured). This adds weight to claims the iPhone 6 could be used as a ‘tap and pay’ device

The images were posted on Chinese social media site Weibo by user Jimas1994, via tech site cnBeta.

The handset is expected to be unveiled on Tuesday 9 September and will come in 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch sizes.

It
 is thought the phone could boast a flexible and scratch-proof sapphire 
screen, which is about to go into large-scale production in the US.

The screen is tipped to be ‘Retina display+’ with a 1,704 x 904 resolution.

Experts
 also predict a faster A8 processor, better rear-facing camera - 
possibly with changeable lenses -and wireless charging support.

It may also include a heart rate sensor like the Samsung Galaxy S5.

A video has also been posted to YouTube by PhoneEvaluation, which claims to be the first review of the new iPhone model. 

In the video and images, the model's larger screen is shown being able to fit an extra row of icons - taking the total up to six, plus the dock, compared to the current row of five plus dock.

Although the video and images don’t reveal much more about the upcoming phone’s other features, it does include an updated Passbook icon.

For example, along the bottom row of icons in the demo video, the Passbook icon is shown with four tabs - red, blue, green and yellow.

By comparison, the current, iOS 7 Passbook icon features just blue, green and yellow.

Passbook is used to store airline boarding passes, movie tickets, and gift cards all in one place, letting users scan their iPhone or iPod touch to check in for a flight, get into a movie, redeem a coupon, and more.

The video and images originated from tech site cnBeta. The video review claims that the iPhone 6's larger screen (pictured right) will be able to feature an extra row of icons. This will raise the number of rows up to six, plus the dock, compared to the row of five plus the dock on the iPhone 5S (pictured, left) 

The extra tab suggests Apple is adding new features to this app, and this adds weights to claims the device will include a mobile payment system.

Last week, reports claimed Apple's iPhone 6 will include a system that lets owners pay in stores simply by tapping their phone on a reader, it has been claimed.

Called Near Field Communication (NFC), the technology is already widely used by credit cards for low-cost payments.

The current, iOS 7 Passbook icon (pictured, centre) features just blue, green and yellow tabs. Passbook is used to store airline boarding passes, movie tickets, and gift cards all in one place, letting users scan their iPhone or iPod touch to check in for a flight, get into a movie, redeem a coupon, and more

The video, posted to YouTube by Phone Evaluation, also compares the thickness of the 0.2-inch (7.6mm) iPhone 5S (pictured left) with the iPhone 6 (pictured right). The iPhone 6 has been dubbed iPhone Air, because of its streamline design, although the precise dimensions have not been revealed

Apple is expected to link the system to its iTunes store, which already holds customer's payment details, and has reportedly signed up Visa, Mastercard and American Express to this new scheme.

According to a source quoted by Bloomberg, 'The agreement includes Visa, MasterCard and American Express, and will be unveiled on Sept. 9 along with the next iPhone.'

'The new iPhone will make mobile payment easier by including a near-field communication chip for the first time', the person told the firm.

Other reports claim the new phones will additionally include a ‘secure element’ to store increased sensitive data.

Apple has also made hires relating to 'building a business around the hundreds of millions of credit cards it already has on file.’

The sales date for the expected new phone has not yet been announced but it has not stopped Apple fans starting to queue in Tokyo

But outside the flagship Apple store in Sydney (pictured), Australia there has been no sign of queues
