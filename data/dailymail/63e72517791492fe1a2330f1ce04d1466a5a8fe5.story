The bosses of taxi phone app Uber are being pressured by taxi regulators to cancel its unaccredited driver service Uber X.

Uber, a smartphone application that connects passengers with hire-car drivers, was founded in San Francisco in 2009. Since then, it has been valued at a whopping $US15 billion.

Uber X is a variation of the original service that allows members of the public to transport people around for a lower cost.

The Passenger Transport Act states that drivers being paid for driving services must be accredited, a law which has led State Governments to threaten drivers with fines of up to $110,000

In Victoria, the Taxi Service Commission has sent a cease-and-desist letter to the company, demanding they terminate the Uber X service.

A spokesperson for the Taxi Service Commission in Victoria told Mashable: 'The cease and desist letter requires Uber to immediately cease and desist offering the UberX product in Victoria. Unaccredited drivers are not subject to the same ongoing criminal checks that accredited drivers are, and this poses a safety risk to passengers and drivers.'

In New South Wales, taxi drivers are demanding the government cancel the service on the grounds that it is dangerous and unlawful.

The company has said they are willing to work with the Governments on the issue.

'We understand that introducing change can be difficult but we continue to work with governments in Australia and around the world to recognise the role ridesharing plays in improving transport options for their cities,' an Uber spokeswoman told The Guardian.
