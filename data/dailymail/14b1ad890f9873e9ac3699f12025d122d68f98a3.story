Dallas billionaire Samuel Wyly has filed
for bankruptcy protection, saying he does not have the money to pay the
nearly $400million in penalties for hiding stock holdings aboard,

Mr Wyly filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition in federal district court in Dallas Sunday.

The one-time owner of the Michaels arts-and-crafts empire has said that his biggest liabilities are to the IRS — the amount is unknown — and $198million to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

In documents filed with a US bankruptcy court in Dallas, Wyly said he had between $100million and $500million
of both assets and liabilities and cited the 'massive costs' of
fighting civil claims from the SEC as the reason for seeking bankruptcy protection.

Last month, US District Judge Shira Scheindlin in New York
ordered Wyly and the estate of his late brother Charles to surrender up to $400million after a civil jury found that they had engaged in a 13-year fraud that involved creating a web of offshore trusts and subsidiaries.

The SEC has since said the total, including interest, should
be $299.4million, not counting $100million in legal fees, which is one of the largest awards ever
sought from individual defendants in a US court.

Wyly, 80, appeared on Forbes' list of the 400 richest
Americans in 2010 at No. 385, with a net worth of $1billion. 

The businessman is married to his third wife, 52-year-old Cheryl Johnson, and has six grown children from his first two marriages.

The couple reside in a palatial $6.5million home featuring five bedrooms, five bathrooms and an outdoor pool in the wealthy Dallas suburb of Highland Park.

Robert Gemmill, a spokesman for Wyly, said he would not
comment beyond the bankruptcy filing. An SEC spokesman declined
to comment.

US Bankruptcy Judge Barbara Houser scheduled an initial
hearing for Wednesday.

The SEC accused the Wyly brothers of constructing a complex
system of trusts in the Isle of Man that netted them $553million in untaxed profits through more than a decade of hidden
trades in four companies they controlled.

Those companies included Sterling Software Inc, Michaels
Stores Inc, Sterling Commerce Inc and Scottish Annuity
& Life Holdings Ltd, now Scottish Re Group Ltd.

They sold Sterling Software for $4billion just before the dot-com bubble burst in 2000, and Michaels Stores was offloaded in 2006 for $6billion.

The SEC said that the brothers used proceeds from secret sales of stock in their companies to buy ranches and condominiums around Aspen, Colorado; a horse farm near Dallas; art and jewelry. 

Charles Wyly was killed in a car crash in 2011 when his Porsche was struck by an SUV in Aspen, Colorado. His estate was
substituted as a defendant in the fraud case.

The SEC and the Wylys have been fighting over whether the
securities regulator may collect money still held in the
offshore trusts.

Lawyers for the Wylys have argued that those assets, worth
about $380million, are controlled by the trusts' beneficiaries,
including the Wylys' children.

In a court filing last week, the SEC said the trusts' assets
are the property of Sam and Charles Wyly.

'The SEC continues to believe that Sam and the estate of
Charles Wyly have sufficient global assets to pay any judgment,' the filing said.

A lawyer for Sam Wyly, Steven Shepard, warned Scheindlin in
August that a massive judgment would bankrupt his client.

It was not immediately clear whether the bankruptcy filing
could allow Wyly to reduce his debt to the SEC.
