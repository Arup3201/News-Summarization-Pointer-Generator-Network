Kevin Keith, 49, and his wife Catherine were held and questioned after the body of Nicole Falkingham, 41 was discovered lying on the back seat of their car

A man arrested after a millionaire property developer's wife was found frozen to death outside his home has been jailed for using his luxury house as a cannabis factory.

Construction worker Kevin Keith, 49, and his wife Catherine were held and questioned after the body of Nicole Falkingham, 41, was discovered lying on the back seat of their black Vauxhall Insignia car in sub zero temperatures.

No charges were brought against the couple for her death, but police investigating the tragedy found nearly 100 cannabis plants being cultivated across three bedrooms at their home in Otterspool, Liverpool.

Once harvested the drugs could have sold on the streets for over £100,000.

Keith  - who also ran a bar - later claimed he was approached to convert part of his house into a drugs farm in return for money after he faced eviction when his own business interests ran into financial difficulties. 

He has today been jailed for 20 months after a judge said the size of the yield had to warrant a sentence of imprisonment.

His wife, also 49, wept as she was given a 12-month jail term suspended for two years with supervision.

The couple  - who have never previously been in trouble with police - were also each ordered to pay £100 victim surcharge after they admitted drugs offences.

A post mortem examination on 41-year-old Mrs Falkingham, from Allerton, who was estranged from husband Jonathan, revealed that she died of hypothermia and acute alcohol intoxication.

The tragedy occurred last year whilst
 Mrs Falkingham was fighting a divorce battle against her 51-year-old 
husband - chief executive of property development firm Urban Splash.

An inquest heard that on the evening of January 24 she had 
been drinking wine in the Vinci bar in Allerton, Liverpool, with four 
friends when according to a barman her condition changed dramatically 
and she suddenly became ‘comatose’.

Bar staff alerted the emergency services, but before they arrived she was picked up by the Keiths, who were family friends, and who gave her a lift back to their home.

Her body was discovered the following morning inside the vehicle dressed in her hooded jacket and luxury Hunter wellington boots after temperatures dipped to minus 2 degrees celcius overnight.

It was never revealed why Mrs Falkingham had been in the car.

No charges were brought against the couple for Mrs Falkingham's death, but police investigating the tragedy found nearly 100 cannabis plants being cultivated across three bedrooms at their home in Otterspool, Liverpool

At the inquest last October a coroner 
recorded a narrative verdict into Mrs Falkingham’s death saying she had 
been 'placed in a vehicle, where she remained overnight.'

But
 police and the coroner’s office declined to reveal the contents of a 
report on the investigation saying it contained 'confidential 
information.'

She had been more than four times over the legal limit and had a blood toxicity level of 333 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood. 

Police questioned the Keiths on suspicion of manslaughter through gross negligence - but prosecutors said there was insufficient evidence to charge them.

At Liverpool Crown Court, prosecutor Geoffrey Lowe said during inquiries into the tragedy, officers searched the couple’s home and found three bedrooms had been adapted to grow 95 cannabis plants.

The electricity meter was also tampered with and bypassed to help with the cultivation process. The first bedroom yield was estimated to valued at up £28,200, the second bedroom at up to £37,000 and the third bedroom at up to £42,000.

Mr Lowe added: 'He took full responsibility of the production to help out with the financial difficulty they were currently in.

'He maintains he was approached by others who were aware of his financial difficulty, he did not supply all the equipment, he did not arrange for the electricity to be bypassed.

'It was the first crop, there was no earlier cultivation, the fee would have been dedicated to clearing the mortgage arrears. He accepts that he fed and watered the plants.'

Keith admitted producing Class B drugs between December 1, 2012 and January 25, 2013 and of dishonestly abstracting electricity without authority.

His wife admitted allowing the house to be used for the production of cannabis. In mitigation Keith’s lawyer Damian Nolan said: 'This is a man who has been hard working, no previous convictions or cautions.

'In 2010, the downturn in the economic situation, the bar business struggled and the business folded.

'He was still liable for financial commitments the bar had incurred and he wasn’t able to as well as his own mortgage. His daughters were still at school age and he found it an incredible burden.

'Someone approached him and offered to him for a short period of time, if willing to turn over part of his house for the cultivation of cannabis, he would be provided with a sum of money.

'He was not involved in the purchase of equipment or arrangement of how to set it up, he was not responsible, but he has to accept for the interference in electricity supply, the bedrooms where the crop was growing was cost free.

'Those who owned the crop would reap the benefits of cultivation. He knew he would receive something sizeable enough to make it worthwhile.

'Simply the money would be to pay off debts.'

For Mrs Keith, Miss Martine Snowdon said: 'She has had a happy, successful and law-abiding life and up until these offences she had everything to be proud of.

'The inability to stand up and deal with it all has meant it all come crashing down around her. She has lost her home.

'She feels real deep shame and regret for her involvement in this. She feels deeply ashamed to her three daughters that she allowed herself to become involved in this.

'She has had a terrible 12 months with this hanging over her.'

Passing sentence the judge Miss Recorder Elizabeth Nicholls told Keith: 'The court is very, very much aware of the tragic circumstances that brought police to your door and everyone will have nothing but heartfelt sympathies to her family and friends. 

'No doubt 25 January was not only traumatic for you and those involved and will cause hurt but out of these facts arose the offences you are to be sentenced for, they have nothing to do with the tragic circumstances of the police attendance.

'I have taken into account the beautiful character references, the fact you have never been in trouble before.

'No doubt this has had a profound effect on you and your family but I’m afraid with 95 plants ranging in value from £53,000 to £107,000 there has to be an immediate term of imprisonment.

'I hope that when you are released you continue your law abiding existence.'
