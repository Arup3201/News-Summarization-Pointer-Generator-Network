Christine Hamilton is turning businesswoman – and has sunk her cash into a slimming drink that she credits with helping her drop a dress size. 

Christine, pictured below with husband Neil, the former Tory MP, is set to become the face of £19-per-pack SLIM-BE Shots.

The powdered drink contains konjac, a jelly-like substance made from a Japanese plant, which aids weight loss by gently expanding in the stomach to give a feeling of fullness.

Christine, 65, isn’t saying just how much money she has invested but claims the concoction helped her shed a stone three years ago – and she has kept it off.

‘I’ve had enough of beastly politics and thought I would become a businesswoman,’ she reveals. ‘Konjac has monster hunger-busting properties.’

She will be selling the product on shopping channel QVC.

A device that can help GPs tell the difference between bacterial and viral infections has been welcomed by health chiefs as a way to halt the over-use of antibiotic medication.

The hand-held device, the size of a rattle, contains a sensor that can analyse a nasal swab taken in the doctor’s surgery.

It gives a positive reading within seconds if the patient has Influenza A or B – common flu strains in recent epidemics – or RSV, the Respiratory Syncytial Virus that is a major cause of coughs and chest infections. These do not respond to antibiotics, which target only bacterial infections.

Dr Maureen Baker, chairman of the Royal College of General Practitioners, says: ‘GPs have so far had to employ a certain level of risk management when there is no certainty of the cause of illness, and are under pressure from assertive patients to prescribe.

‘However, the fact that so few new antibiotics have been developed is also an issue, as is the willingness of patients to accept that lots of bacterial infections as well as viruses will settle down on their own in a few days.’

Sex pill cools hot flushes

A natural supplement known as the ‘female Viagra’, which is designed to help women with a low sex drive, has been found to reduce symptoms in women who are on the verge of the menopause.

Lady Prelox, a ‘pink pill’ containing French pine bark extract pycnogenol, combined with rose hip extract and amino acids L-Arginine and L-Citrulline, was tested on 80 women in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at the University of Sofia in Bulgaria.

The results found that after a month of taking the supplement four times a day, participants’ sexual appetite was boosted by 60 per cent, and by 73 per cent after two months – compared with 40 per cent and 46 per cent in the placebo group.

Women also reported that hot flushes, sleep problems and cognitive issues improved. 

The findings were published in the Journal Of Women’s Healthcare.

Families of dementia patients can see their loved ones at any time of the day or night after a hospital scrapped traditional visiting hours.

Instead, relatives visiting patients at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust in London will be issued with a special ‘carer’s passport’ to allow them to drop in outside normal hours.

The move aims to help dementia patients feel more settled, as they can become confused or agitated in an unfamiliar environment.

Jo James, the trust’s lead nurse on dementia, said: ‘Patients who have dementia or are vulnerable often rely on their carers to help guide them through everyday life experiences, including time spent in hospital. However, traditional visiting times do not enable carers to fulfil this important role.’

It is a part of a wider drive to improve care for dementia patients. Other measures include a weekly drop-in clinic for relatives and friends, and awareness training for all trust staff.

Young diabetics get Angry

Children with diabetes are being given help to monitor their illness – with the Angry Birds game. 

Technology company MODZ has launched a blood glucose meter featuring the characters from the multi-million-selling app.

The touchscreen device motivates children affected by type 1 diabetes to take control of their health, by reminding them to test their blood glucose levels.

It uses the colours of the Angry Birds characters to correspond to the child’s blood glucose levels and awards users points for good test results, allowing them to progress. Starter kits cost from £252.
