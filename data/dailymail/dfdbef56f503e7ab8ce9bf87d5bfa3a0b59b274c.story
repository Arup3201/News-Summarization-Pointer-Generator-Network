A deputy council leader has stood down after it emerged he watched a hardcore porn DVD on his work laptop.

Tory
David Sprason admitted watching a pornographic movie called She Likes 
It Rough at home with his wife Sue, 51, who is also a councillor.

But
while the cabinet lead member for adults and communities admitted 
making an ‘error of judgment’ when the couple watched the film at home 
in bed, he is far from embarrassed about it.

To help their relationship: Councillor David Sprason (right) admitted to watching hardcore porn film 'She Likes It Rough' on a council laptop with wife Sue Sprason (left) because their home DVD player broke

Mr Sprason, 56, yesterday said the film was one of the ‘tools’ the couple used to ‘help’ their relationship.

The DVD was found when Mr Sprason 
took his laptop to council IT workers for repairs. He said: ‘The laptop 
crashed and I took it to get it repaired. I should have taken the film 
out and put it back in its box.

‘I was probably rushing around the next morning and grabbed it before going in to County Hall.

‘Me
and the wife use things to help our relationship. That’s one of the 
tools we use. We both enjoy them. It’s one of those situations that 
shouldn’t have happened.

‘I’m not embarrassed. There was nothing dodgy about it.

‘It’s the kind of thing that can easily be bought in an adult shop.’

The
incident took place in 2007, but has only just come to light after a 
copy of a confidential letter sent to Mr Sprason by former 
Leicestershire County Council monitoring officer Elizabeth McCalla was 
anonymously leaked to a local newspaper.

In the letter, Miss McCalla said the DVD had been sent to the police ‘to ensure it did not contain any unlawful material’.

Investigated: Leicestershire County Council checked Cl Sprason's internet usage from the laptop and found nothing untoward but since the incident has gone public, Tory whips are doing their own internal investigation

She
said: ‘They subsequently advised me the DVD contained hardcore 
pornography of the type you might be able to buy in this country, but 
more likely to buy abroad or over the internet, but that no criminal 
offence had been committed.’

Although it was considered that Mr 
Sprason had breached council policy, the letter said the matter was not 
pursued because the DVD was watched in a private capacity.

Mrs Sprason said of the porn film: ‘Our DVD player broke so we unfortunately used a county council laptop (to watch it).

‘We are a middle-aged couple who love each other as much as we did when we were in our 20s.

‘When you get to middle age, you need a bit of assistance.’

After
the DVD was found five years ago, officers at council headquarters 
checked Mr Sprason’s internet usage and found nothing untoward.

However,
Miss McCalla warned him not to view pornography on a county council 
computer again ‘otherwise I have no alternative but to pursue the matter
further’.

Mr
Sprason yesterday said he had referred the incident to the Conservative
group on the council in order for whips to investigate, after he became
aware the letter had been leaked.

'Error of judgement': Cl Sprason said he forgot to take the DVD out of the computer's CD drive before handing it to council IT workers for repair

He has stepped down as deputy leader but will continue as a councillor while the investigation continues.

The
councillor, who represents Markfield, Desford and Thornton, said: ‘Most
of the feedback I have had from  people is that this is all a storm in a
tea cup.

‘If this damages 
my chances of re-election then so be it but I am honest and 
straightforward and it is better to be open. I am just an ordinary guy 
who works hard for his patch and that is what I’ll continue to do.’

Nick
Rushton, the council leader, said that under new Conservative group 
rules introduced following the resignation in July of his predecessor, 
David Parsons, members were required to either step down or be suspended
while an investigation took place to ensure no breach of the party’s 
rules had taken place.

Mr Rushton said it was imperative the
authority was ‘seen to be acting in accordance with the highest 
standards of conduct’, adding that Mr Sprason had made the ‘right 
decision, personally and in the interests of the council’s reputation’.

Mr Rushton said he found it 
‘disappointing’ that Mr Parsons didn’t ‘deal with this matter properly 
through the group rules at the time’.

Mr Parsons resigned shortly after it emerged police had begun an investigation into his travel expense claims.
