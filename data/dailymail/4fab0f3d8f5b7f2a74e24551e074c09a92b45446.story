Deanna Duggar has recalled a terrifying car crash that nearly killed her and her daughter Amy.

The sister of Jim Bob Duggar, the star of TLC show '19 Kids and Counting', was driving home from dinner on New Year's Day in 1993 with  Amy, then six, when their car hit a patch of ice on a bridge on I-40 in Arkansas.

The vehicle started spinning and was struck by another car, throwing her from the vehicle and into the road, the 52-year-old told RadarOnline.

Suddenly, another car came towards her as she lay helpless in the street.

'I felt the tire go over my leg,' she told Radar. 'I saw the bone come out. I was in sheer shock. I thought, "I don't want to die today".'

Even though her leg was broken in two places and she suffered a cracked pelvis and collarbone, she managed to crawl across the road to safety.

A witness called 911 and she was rushed to hospital. 

Amy had stayed inside the car and only suffered bumps and bruises, and a mystery woman rushed to her side before taking her to the hospital.

'She said, "It's going to be okay, sweet girl",' Amy Duggar, now 28, told Radar.

'She didn't sign any papers at the hospital, and we never heard from her again. It was a miracle.'

The pair credit God with saving their lives in the accident.

It 'made me realize that life is so precious and you should count your blessings every day,' Deanna said. 'Don't hold back on your dreams.'

For Amy, that dream involves becoming a country singer, and the TLC show has followed her to Nashville as she tries to break into the music scene. 

She also made headlines last month after it emerged that her parents, Deanna and Terry, gave birth to her out of wedlock - a sin in the eyes of her ultra-religious family.

They were 25 when they had her but didn't get married until 2006, 18 years after Amy's birth.

Amy confirmed the rumors on her Instagram page.

'The tabloids are telling the truth, my mom and dad did have me out of wedlock,' she wrote. 'I'm sure [my mom] was scared, young, ridiculed, and felt ashamed.' 

'Just because we are Christians doesn't make us perfect, it just makes us forgiven. Just because I share the Duggar name doesn't mean my life is perfect!

'God knew my uncle would have a hit show and that somehow I would be part of it. He knew my parents' story would be told. How amazing is that?!'
