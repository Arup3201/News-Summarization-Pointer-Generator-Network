Robin van Persie showed it isn't all work and no play in the Holland camp as the striker took time out to play 'no look beach tennis' with assistant manager Patrick Kluivert.

The Dutch striker, with paddle in hand, knocks the ball to and from Kluivert without looking and throws in a few twirls for good measure.

The outing was for Kluivert's 38th birthday, as Van Persie wrote: 'Celebrating Patrick Kluivert b-day in style with some no look beach tennis #DoNotTryThisAtHome'

VIDEO RVP isn't the only one playing on the beach... watch Arsene Wenger's diving header!

To me, to you: Holland striker Robin van Persie and assistant manager Patrick Kluivert play together

Don't look now: Van Persie knocks it back to Kluivert in a game of 'no look beach tennis'

It's behind you: Van Persie was having a bit of fun to celebrate Kluivert's birthday in Brazil

Backwards: Van Persie will keep his eyes open on the pitch, though, come Saturday against Costa Rica

Anything you can do... Kluivert gets in on the act but they won't be joking on Saturday

5 - James Rodriguez (Colombia)

4 - Thomas Muller (Germany), Lionel Messi (Argentina), Neymar (Brazil)

3 - Robin van Persie (Holland), Arjen Robben (Holland), Karim Benzema (France), Enner Valencia (Ecuador), Xherdan Shaqiri (Switzerland)

Those in italics are out of the World Cup.

Van Persie and Holland take on Costa Rica on Saturday to pursue a place in the semi-finals.

But, on a personal note, Van Persie may have his eye on the Golden Boot award.

The Manchester United striker sits on three goals alongside team-mate Arjen Robben, Karim Benzema, Enner Valencia and Xherdan Shaqiri.

But a goal behind Thomas Muller, Lionel Messi and Neymar, and two behind the impressive James Rodriguez on five.

That can all change come Saturday, though, should Van Persie continue his fine form in Salvador.

Van Persie's World Cup campaign has given those at Old Trafford reason to be cheerful, as the former Arsenal goalscorer seems to enjoy life under impending boss Louis van Gaal.
