Lord Justice Leveson is facing fresh questions over his refusal to investigate an affair between a member of his legal team and a lawyer representing phone hacking victims.

A Conservative MP has written to the judge, who was in charge of last year’s public inquiry into Press standards, querying his insistence that Carine Patry Hoskins had no input into its key conclusions.

Rob Wilson, a parliamentary aide to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, is calling for a full investigation by the Bar Standards Board into revelations that Miss Patry Hoskins and celebrities’ barrister David Sherborne are lovers.

No probe: Lord Justice Leveson is refusing to investigate the affair between Carine Patry Hoskins, a member of his legal team, and David Sherborne, a lawyer representing phone hacking victims

The Standards Board’s code of conduct suggests affairs between opposing lawyers should be avoided in case the perception be created of ‘a danger of a breach of confidence or other conspiracy’.

Twice-married Mr Sherborne, 44, represented Hugh Grant and other celebrity victims of phone hacking.

The father-of-three and Miss Patry Hoskins, 40, a married mother-of-two, admit going on holiday to the romantic Greek island of Santorini in August last year, days after the inquiry’s public hearings ended in July. But they claim their affair did not begin until after the Leveson report was published in November.

The couple did not tell Lord Justice Leveson or his senior counsel, Robert Jay QC, about the relationship.

The judge only learnt of their trip to the Greek island – during which the couple say they discussed ‘the possibility of a future relationship’ – when the Daily Mail asked him to comment on it after revealing the affair.

No effect: Leveson has dismissed the idea that his report on media standards could have been tainted by the alleged relationship between Carine Patry Hoskins and David Sherborne

Lord Justice Leveson has dismissed 
criticism that the revelations have undermined his inquiry, saying there
was ‘simply no room’ for a ‘breach of confidence or other conspiracy’.

He insisted Miss Patry Hoskins had ‘absolutely no input into any conclusion’ and was ‘simply not involved in any aspect’ of his proposals for Press regulation.

In his letter to the judge, Mr Wilson 
queried why he had cited August 3 of last year, shortly before draft 
criticisms were sent to key players for comment, as the crucial ‘cut 
off’ date in the case.

As controversy continues over a new system of Press regulation in the wake of the Leveson report, a senior figure said yesterday that the newspaper industry’s proposals for a Royal Charter on the issue deserve ‘equal consideration’ alongside plans drawn up by the Government.

Lord Wakeham, a former Conservative Cabinet minister and ex-chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, said the proposals could meet Lord Justice Leveson’s call  for independent voluntary self-regulation.

Last week the newspaper industry rejected the Government’s plans for Press regulation.

It submitted a rival proposal for a Royal Charter to enshrine a new watchdog with the power to levy £1million fines on errant publishers and require prominent corrections of errors.

He wrote: ‘In your letter you suggest 
that Ms Patry Hoskins had “no input into any conclusion as to the past 
treatment of those affected by Press abuses (or, indeed, the 
relationship between the Press and the public as considered by module 
one of the inquiry) or any aspect of the proposals made for future Press
regulation” between August 3 and publication of your report in November
2012.

‘Is it possible that she may have had an input into the inquiry’s conclusions before August 3, 2012?

‘If the answer … is yes, I would be grateful if you would confirm what work did Ms Patry Hoskins in fact did prior to August 3 (aside from questioning witnesses).’

Mr Wilson, MP for Reading East, also asked how much of the cost of the four counsel to the inquiry–  £1,353,900 between them as of October 2012 – went to Miss Patry Hoskins.

MPs have demanded that Lord Justice Leveson launch a full investigation, and a series of questions about who knew what and when remain to be answered.

Miss Patry Hoskins, dubbed the ‘thinking man’s Pippa Middleton’, was required to be totally independent when testing evidence given to the inquiry on behalf of the public.

She questioned witnesses, including Mr Sherborne’s clients, with grievances against the Press.

At one point she trended on Twitter as #womanontheleft after being spotted by viewers who suggested she was making eyes at Mr Grant.

She is understood to be divorcing her 45-year-old husband, QC Mark Hoskins.
