When Tim Krul began talking about 
intimidation on Sunday, Holland’s penalty shoot-out hero admitted he 
crossed the fine line when it comes to sporting behaviour.

The Newcastle goalkeeper, thrown on by
 Louis van Gaal in the 119th minute of their quarter-final with Costa 
Rica in Salvador, had screamed ‘Vamos!’ in the face of every penalty 
taker.

It pushed the boundaries, but Krul 
couldn’t care less. Holland play Argentina in a mouth-watering 
semi-final in Sao Paulo on Wednesday and Costa Rica are on their way 
home from the World Cup in Brazil.

For Krul, who saved two penalties 
after he replaced Holland’s first choice 'keeper Jasper Cillessen, there 
was no apology and no regrets.

He said: ‘I don’t think I did anything wrong. I didn’t shout in an aggressive manner.

‘I did everything in my power and I 
would be happy to do it again, absolutely no problem. There are no 
regrets. I was ready for the moment.

‘I told them I knew where they were going and I had analysed it. I tried to get in their heads and it worked.

‘The manager and the 'keeper coach 
Frans Hoek told me before the game that if there was a substitution left
 then there was a possibility I would be used in the shoot-out.

‘I only heard at the hotel, when I was stepping on to bus to the stadium that I could be used.

‘Frans told me to keep it between us 
because we wanted to finish it the job before the 90, or 120, minutes. I
 watched the game with a different feel because I knew that it could 
happen.’

When it did, in the 119th minute of a dramatic and absorbing clash, Cillessen kicked a water bottle as he walked off the pitch.

The Ajax keeper was calmer on Sunday, even joking that he only kicked the bottle to spray water over Hoek to ‘cool him down’.

Power of persuasion: Did Tim Krul influence the Costa Rica players with his pre-penalty routine?

By then Krul had been through a 
thorough warm-up on the touchline in the Arena Fonte Nova as they 
attempted to psyche out Costa Rica’s players in the moments before the 
end of extra-time.

Krul, who revealed Costa Rica’s 
players changed the direction of their penalties in the shoot-out, went 
on to save efforts Bryan Ruiz and Michael Umana.

The Holland 'keeper added: ‘When I started my warm up the whole bench was confused about what was going on.

‘If you see their manager’s (Jorge Luis Pinto) face, he was looking over to see Louis van Gaal and it was priceless.

‘They were under massive pressure to 
deliver. It was a way of trying to psyche them out and they were 
definitely unsettled when I started warming up.

‘I did nothing crazy. Against Greece they took the penalties five times differently from the way they took them against me.’

Van Gaal revealed that he had turned 
to Krul because he believed the goalkeeper’s greater physical presence would
 be a psychological advantage in the shoot-out.

At 1m93cm Krul is five centimetres 
taller than Holland’s first choice keeper, but his record at saving 
penalties has not been good.

Although he saved a penalty for 
Newcastle against Chelsea’s reliable penalty taker Frank Lampard last 
season, Krul hadn’t saved any of his previous five.

Despite Cillessen’s anger when van 
Gaal made the unusual decision to replace him, the Holland keeper was 
the first on to the pitch to congratulate Krul when he tipped Umana’s 
effort around the post to win it.

Cillessen said: ‘He made two big, big saves - Tim is the big man now.

‘I didn’t know it was going to happen before the game and it was a bit of a surprise for it to happen.

‘I was angry because I wanted to face the penalties and it seems a pity that I wasn’t told, but it worked very well.’

On Sunday the pair were out on the 
practice pitches at Flamengo’s training ground in Rio and they are 
already prepared for the possibility of a shootout with Argentina.

Krul revealed that Holland’s keepers 
have been practising penalties for seven weeks as they prepared for 
every eventuality at the World Cup.

He added: ‘We will analyse every 
Argentina penalty and write up a plan between us. That’s why we have 
been practising for seven weeks.

‘It is an honour to have a coach like 
van Gaal and he is proving what a great tactical coach he is. Manchester
 United are lucky to have him.’
