There is still a ‘shameful’ lack of working class people on public bodies as the establishment maintains its stranglehold on British life.

Parliament is now more dominated by the middle classes than it was in 1979, with just 4 per cent of MPs from manual trades - down from 16 per cent.

Those from working class backgrounds are also under-represented among local magistrates, according to the damning report from centre-right think tank Policy Exchange.

Experts say that Parliament is more dominated by the middle classes than in 1979, with just 4 per cent of MPs from a manual trades background

The study found that Labour’s equalities policies have failed to promote people from working class communities to public office.

The Equality Act 2010 stipulated that discriminating on the grounds of gender, race and disability is wrong, but no reference was made to socio-economic background.

Constitutional expert Dr Michael Pinto-Duschinsky, lead author of the report, said: ‘It is vital for a functioning democracy that all its citizens are represented in public life, no matter their background, colour or gender.

‘Quite frankly it’s shameful that working class communities are being excluded from sitting on public bodies. Setting up an immediate inquiry into this problem will help determine the size of this problem and draw attention to a much needed area of debate.

The establishment has a stranglehold on British life according to experts who have analysed the work backgrounds of those working in parliament compared to 36 years ago

‘Diversity policies that reflect the true make up of this country will ensure that our brightest and best - regardless of their backgrounds - are given the opportunity to make a real difference to their communities.

‘Action to encourage individuals in manual occupations should not be in the form of quotas or statistical “targets”.

Rather, there should be special schemes to help those in manual occupations to apply for roles and to persuade employers to grant time off to carry out public duties.’

The paper warned that current diversity policies are far too narrow, focusing on gender, disability and ethnicity to the exclusion of class.

The experts also found that working class people were underrepresented on magistrates benches

It found that while the number of female and minority ethnic MPs has risen since the end of the 1970s, the percentage of manual workers in parliament has substantially diminished - from 98 (16 per cent) in 1979 to 25 (4 per cent) in 2010.

The working classes are also underrepresented on magistrates benches.

The number of women acting as local magistrates, for example, still needs to increase by more than 40 per cent of above their present number before they reach parity with their percentage in the general population.

For ethnic minorities there would need to be an increase of some 150 per cent to achieve parity. But for those in routine and manual occupations, the increase needs to be no less than 873 per cent.

In other words, they are nearly 10 times under-represented.

The report also found that the panels that select public appointments are almost entirely - 96 per cent - made up of middle class professionals. Not a single person came were from a manual or routine occupation.

It said that while it is expected that those selecting the next British judge to Strasbourg would have a professional understanding of law, there is no such requirement for lay magistrates, school governors or volunteers visiting prisons as independent monitors.

Dr Pinto-Duschinsky concluded that the UK needs an extension to its entire equalities policy, and calls for an inquiry to be run by the Government Equalities Office and the Equality and Human Rights Commission.

The inquiry should report on the facts about the percentage of public appointees from routine and manual occupations, recommend special initiatives to encourage such appointments and set out how socio-economic equality will be made an integral part of their future work.

The new policy should not involve quotas, ‘targets’ or legislative stipulations, but instead special initiatives to encourage under-represented groups to apply for public office.

The paper also calls for greater transparency about the membership of interviewing panels for public appointments, and to avoid the overabundance of civil servants on these panels, to ensure that there are no underlying prejudices or inherent bias in the selection process.
