A Houston, Texas hospital lost a partially-paralyzed diabetic mother for three days and told her family she checked out of the facilty.

Mary Reyna, 69, was transported to St Joseph's Medical center on Saturday after suffering what appeared to be a panic attack. She is partially-paralyzed from a stroke and her daughter Rose Zuniga thought the hospital was the best place for her to be.

Zuniga called two hours later to check in on her mother's status but was told that she had been released.

Mary Reyna, 69 (pictured), was lost for three days before being located in a stairwell at Houston's St Joseph's Medical Center

Reyna was submitted to the hospital on Saturday after suffering a panic attack. When her daughter called two hours later, staff said she had been discharged. She wasn't found until Tuesday

However, no family members had been informed and no one picked the woman up.

For the next three days, family and local authorities frantically serached for Reyna to no avail.

Then on Tuesday, Zuniga finally got the call that her mother had been found.

'They found her on the fourth floor of stairwell. I said, "You mean she's been there almost two or three days?"' Zuniga told KHOU.

When she and other family showed up at the hospital they found Reyna wallowing in her own waste, with signs of deterioration from missing insulin shots.

'She was all dirty. She was like passing out,' Zuniga said. 'How can they treat somebody like that?'

Reyna is now in a different room at the hospital, but is still confused and emotional about her three days missing.

Hiding spot: Reyna claims a hospital worker locked her in a room for three days and that when she escaped, she ran to the stairwell

Reyna is a diabetic and needs insulin shots regularly. Her family released pictures of Reyna after she was found, clearly suffering from not receiving the usual doses

Reyna was confused and emotional after the trying experience

She told reporters that a hospital worker locked her in a room for three days and that when she managed to escape, she climbed the stairwell.

The hospital has since issued a statement, confirming the complaint from Reyna's family.

'As a hospital that provides care to hundreds of patients each day, St. Joseph Medical Center takes the welfare of its patients seriously and responds quickly any time it learns of a complaint.

'In immediate response to this matter, we have commenced an internal review which is ongoing. What we know so far is that, after the patient was discharged, the hospital staff immediately attempted to reach the patient's family but, unfortunately, had been given incorrect contact information by the patient. When hospital staff returned promptly to obtain additional contact information from the patient, she had left the waiting area on her own.

'It is our top priority to understand what happened after this patient was discharged and we will work with the family toward that end.'
