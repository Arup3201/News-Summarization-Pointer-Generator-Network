A grinning, chuckling Kathleen Sebelius stood alongside President Barack Obama on Friday morning, accepting praise that has eluded her throughout Obamacare's troubled early months.

Only 10 days ago, the president ignored her as he took a victory lap when the Affordable Care Act's signup numbers crested above 7 million. But he had kind words for the health insurance warrior in her final public appearance as a federal government employee.

She told him 'in early March' that she would leave shortly after the April 1 insurance open-enrollment deadline. But on March 31, she told The Huffington Post that she would remain on the job until November.

Now that she's no longer Obama's ham-fisted insurance surrogate, plagued with 'oops' moments in one congressional hearing after another, it's smiles all around.

Sebelius and her team 'got the job done' with Obamacare, he said of the manager who bungled the most ambitious health initiative in U.S. history, and 'the final score speaks for itself.'

Suddenly friendly: HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius accepted congratulations from the president and vice president during her final White House appearance, although Obama snubbed her last week when Obamacare enrollment numbers looked promising for the first time

New HHS Secretary nominee Syliva Burwell, who now heads the Office of Management and Budget, beamed as she accepted praise from the boss and applause from a partisan crowd

On Friday Sebelius called her job helming HHS 'the opportunity of a lifetime.' The president praised her for 'five years of extraordinary service to our country.'

'I will miss her advice, I will miss her friendship, I will miss her wit,' he said.

Even her farewell speech had its panic moment. 'A page is missing,' Sebelius said before improvising the end of her remarks.

Obama's well-wishes included moments of Obamacare crescendo, but equal time for other liberal identity-politics totems.

She 'has been here through the long fight to pass the ACA,' Obama said. 'She helped guide its implementation even when it got rough.'

But Sebelius, Obama said, had also 'reduced racial and ethnic disparities' in Americans' well-being, and was 'a tireless advocate for women's health.'

Sylvia Mathews Burwell, who heads the White House Office of Management and Budget, was nominated to take her place.

Obama appeared with the outgoing and incoming HHS secretaries in the White House Rose Garden, shortly before jetting off for fundraisers, and a speech to Al Sharpton's National Action Network, in New York City.

Sebelius' replacement is Sylvia 
Mathews Burwell, a long-time Democratic operative whose political career
 has come in two acts with a lengthy intermission. 

Burwell
 served in the Clinton White House as deputy to then-budget director 
Jack Lew, who would later become Obama's treasury secretary. She was 
briefly ensnared in an investigation into the suicide death of Deputy 
White House counsel Vince Foster.

As
 Secret Service agents scoured Foster's office for clues about why he 
took his life, Burwell briefly sifted through a 'burn bag' containing 
classified documents that she wasn't supposed to see.

After
 a stint as deputy chief of staff during the Monica Lewinsky crisis, she
 went to the private sector, first at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and later at the top of the Walmart foundation, the 
mega-retail chain's charitable arm – only to succumb again to 
Washington's lure.

The U.S. Senate confirmed her last year to run OMB, by a 96-0 margin.

Oops! 'A page is missing,' Sebelius said, skipping a portion of her speech in the final cock-up of her time at HHS

Lean forward: Obama hopes to wipe the Obamacare slate clean with a new quarterback, but Senate Republicans will likely turn her confirmation hearing into an license to fish for new information about the unpopular policy

The timing of Sebelius' departure was designed to allow her to leave with a scrap of honor, coming just a week after Obama announced that his administration had exceeded its target of 7 million enrollees after months of fiasco.

Obama brought past and future HHS secretaries to a Rose Garden event attended by officials including Shaun Donovan, Gina McCarthy, Anthony Foxx, Tom Vilsack, John Kerry, Valerie Jarrett, Jeff Zients, Tina Tchen and Shailagh Murray

She 'has been here through the long fight to pass the Affordable Care Act,' Obama gushed. 'She helped guide its implementation even when it got rough. She's got bumps. I've got bumps, and bruises.'

The White House aims for her resignation to soften the constant barrage of controversies connected with the president's flagship policy.

Republicans were quick to pounce Thursday, confounding those hopes.

'Kathleen Sebelius had a supremely difficult job implementing a law as unpopular and unwieldy as Obamacare,' House Oversight Committee chair Rep. Darrell Issa said in a statement.

'Her tenure as the head of the Department of Health and Human Services may be at an end, but Americans will be dealing with the repercussions of the president's health law for a very long time.'

On the Senate side of the U.S. Capitol, minority leader Mitch McConnell called it 'fitting that nearly one year after the primary legislative architect of Obamacare predicted it would be a train wreck that the government official most responsible for overseeing it reportedly is resigning.'

'Regardless of the administration’s public explanation for the Secretary’s exit, Obamacare has been a rolling disaster and her resignation is cold comfort to the millions of Americans who were deceived about what it would mean for them and their families.'

The train-wreck reference was a nod to former Montana Democratic Sen. Max Baucus, now Obama's ambassador to China, who warned Sebelius on April 17, 2013 that the Affordable Care Act was headed for the rocks.

'I just see a huge train wreck coming down," he said then. 'You and I have discussed this many times, and I don't see any results yet.'

Dela vu: 13 months ago Obama introduced Sylvia Burwell in the East Room of the White House as him new budget director

The Affordable Care Act has been fraught
 with trouble since its official rollout in October. Its website 
crashed, cost estimates quickly rose, and public dissatisfaction has 
dogged the initiative for more than two years.

The
 October 1 online unveiling was nothing short of disastrous, with even 
liberal commentators and Democrats in Congress conceding that the 
government's effort was not ready for prime time. Contractors' efforts 
were incompatible, data servers were inadequate, and payment systems 
linked to the website were yet to be built on launch day.

Kathleen Sebelius joined the Obama administration in April 2009 as a figure unknown to Americans in 49 states. She had been  governor of Kansas from 2003 to 2009, and that state;s insurance commissioner for eight years before that.

Her only national platform prior to Obama's election came in 2008 when, as a former chair of the Democratic Governors Association, she was tapped to deliver her party's response to President George W. Bush's final State of the Union address.

She wasn't expected to play a role in the new administration until former Sen. Tom Daschle, a South Dakota politician who had once been Senate Majority Leader, withdrew his candidacy for the top HHS job following a tax scandal.

He had failed to pay taxes on more than $83,000 in earnings in 2007, and claimed tax deductions for nearly $15,000 of donations to charities that didn't meet the IRS's tax-deductibility standards.

Sebelius hasn't said where she will go after she leaves the president's cabinet. Her three immediate predecessors have found life after government as a law partner (Tommy Thompson), a university professor (Donna Shalala) and a think-tank chief (Mike Leavitt).

None of them, however, presided over a program that, like Obamacare, was controversial, partisan and fraught with failure from the beginning.

Sebelius
 presided over all of it, producing misgivings across the U.S. capital 
that she was up to the task. She has, however, been the administration's
 designated spear-catcher, attracting slings and arrows from both houses
 of Congress and the public at every turn.

The
 president raised eyebrows nationwide on April 1 when he failed to 
acknowledge her contribution to the program's recent 
momentum during a high-profile Rose Garden victory speech.

Sebelius, who has served in Obama's cabinet for five years, was not there alongside him but sat, unnoticed, in the front row.

As the White House shifted from shame to fist-pumping, Sebelius continued to attract scorn.

She said during a Senate Finance Committee hearing on Thursday that more 
than 7.5 million Americans had chosen health insurance plans through the
 Obamacare system.

She could not, however, answer a question from Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch about how many subscribers were 
uninsured before the law took effect.

Additionally,
she hasn't provided Congress with answers about how many Obamacare enrollees have paid premiums, a 
necessary step to become formally enrolled in insurance plans.

A recent McKinsey and Company study estimated that no more than 1 million Americans both lacked insurance before the rollout and have paid money into the system.

Although Democrats will likely have more than enough votes to confirm Burwell as HHS secretary, more than a half-dozen liberals facing difficult re-election fights will be forced to moderate their enthusiasm.

Public hearings could become a spectacle of Republicans demanding internal documents and the White House claiming executive privilege. At the least, the confirmation process will bring to the surface once again conservatives' objections to Obama's new insurance model.

'The president doesn't need more Obamacare controversy so close to November,' a senior aide to a Senate Republican told MailOnline shortly after the announcement of Sebelius' departure.

'And if Republicans object too much to Burwell, the Democrats will trot out the "war on women" narrative even more. We don't need that in an election year.'
