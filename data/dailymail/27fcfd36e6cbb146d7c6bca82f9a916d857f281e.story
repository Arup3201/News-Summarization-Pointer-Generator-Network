A reel of never-before-seen bloopers from the classic 1977 film Star Wars has emerged on the internet and gives a fascinating insight into the making of the movie and some of the laughs enjoyed by the legendary cast.

YouTube user Neil Bowyer posted the two minutes and 36 seconds worth of clips online on Sunday and it has already amassed more than 640,000 views and has plenty of interest to anyone with even a passing interest in the sci-fi classic.

The footage includes 10 outtakes, many of which don’t include audio, including comical scenes of a protective cover falling off Luke Skywalker's landspeeder to reveal hidden wheels and Stormtroopers tripping over the set as they attempt to break into Detention Block AA-23 on the Death Star.

Note: Some scenes do not have audio 

The clips are all from Episode IV: A New Hope, and the various clapperboards reveal they were filmed between May 7 and June 18, 1976. The movie was released in May 1977 and quickly became one of the most successful films of all time.

The clips that do have audio include one of Grand Moff Tarkin (Peter Cushing) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) sharing a laugh as Cushing stumbles over his lines and jokingly threatens to go home.

In another clip Han Solo (Harrison Ford) forgets his lines and starts to chew on a Millennium Falcon prop out of frustration. He famously told director George Lucas during the filming of Star Wars that ‘you can type this s***, but you sure can’t say it.’

There are also amusing clips of Obi-Wan 'Ben' Kenobi (Sir Alec Guinness) hamming it up with Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) and Luke Skywalker (Mark Hammill) struggling with his syntax while sitting in his X-Wing fighter.

‘How do you pronounce “Supernova?”’ asks the actor. ‘What's the inflection? Is it supernova or supernova?’

The clips haven’t appeared before in any of the movie’s countless DVD or Bluray releases, but are part of a new interactive edition of the book The Making of Star Wars (Enhanced Edition) by J.W Rinzler.

The book, which claims to be the definite story behind the original film, has been re-released as a digital Ebook, and enhanced to include rare videos and audio excerpts newly discovered from the Lucasfilm archives.

Following Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm in 2012, a trilogy of movies following on from Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi is currently in pre-production. Episode VII will go into production in early 2014 and is scheduled for a release in mid-2015.

It will be directed by J. J. Abrams with Lucas as creative consultant. Lucas has talked with cast members Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher from the original trilogy about appearing.
