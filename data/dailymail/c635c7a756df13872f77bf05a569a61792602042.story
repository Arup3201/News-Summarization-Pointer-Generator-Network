Northern Ireland captain Steven Davis will attempt to steer clear of the growing expectation surrounding the side following their flawless start to Euro 2016 qualifying.

A clinical 2-0 away win over Group F's faltering favourites Greece on Tuesday made it three wins in three for Michael O'Neill's men, Northern Ireland's best ever start to a World Cup or European campaign.

That leaves them top of the standings by two points and in with a wonderful chance of reaching their first major finals in 30 years.

But while Southampton midfielder Davis is delighted for the fans back home, who can now start to dream of an unexpected trip to France, he feels it is no bad thing for the squad to get back across the water and away from the excitement.

'I don't think trying to keep our feet on the ground will be much of an issue,' said Davis, whose side came into the group having dropped into seeding pot five.

'It may help that we don't see the hype at home but it is great to have that again.

'People have optimism but we know there is another tough away game next month in Romania and the most important thing for us is to continue the momentum.

'It's been an unbelievable start for us because I don't think anyone could have foreseen it, especially the way the fixtures came out with two tough away games in Hungary and Greece.

'We are just delighted with the start and we will enjoy it but then it's about concentrating on Romania next month.'

Northern Ireland striker Kyle Lafferty has scored in all three of their Euro 2016 qualifiers so far

Davis joined the praise for striker Kyle Lafferty, who maintained his own 100 per cent record of scoring in every game so far.

The Norwich man has not always delivered on his promise on the international stage but has shown a new-found maturity this year, with man-of-the-match displays against Hungary, the Faroe Islands and Greece.

And Davis is delighted to see his former Rangers team-mate back at his imposing best.

'Big Laff has been excellent. He gives us that outlet and in the first three games he's been outstanding,' he said.

'He's been unbelievable for us but that is the sort of thing we are going to need from him if we are going to be successful.

'It's been an excellent start and I'm sure he will take a lot of confidence from it.

'He really deserves it. He works so hard for the team, even in the past and it's nice to see him getting his rewards.'
