The fall-out from the World Cup has seen Roy Hodgson plus his England players and tracksuit assistants split up from the rest of the FA travelling party on away trips to remain focused.

As a result, the FA had to book two hotels in Tallinn before Sunday night’s European qualifier against Estonia to ensure administrative staff are in a separate hotel from Hodgson’s squad — even when staying for only one night.

This new two-hotel policy, which was also used in Basle ahead of the first qualifier against Switzerland, resulted from a number of internal debriefs following the debacle in Brazil.

Hodgson felt there were too many FA personnel and associated staff around the players during the World Cup, particularly at meal times and on match days — not surprising when the FA party for the tournament climbed to over 80.

The FA, who take far fewer to an away qualifier, are not the only ones with this strategy. World champions Germany are said to have split their delegation — which is even bigger than England’s — between four hotels in Brazil.

However, I’m sure Hodgson, Gary Neville and Co will be delighted to know that the best accommodation in Tallinn — the grand Presidential Suite in the Radisson Blu Hotel where George W Bush stayed and big enough for a team meeting — was allocated by the discerning travel company to your Sports Agenda columnist.

Former Chelsea footballer Paul Elliott joining the FA Council as the new representative for the Inclusion Advisory Board — the first black footballer on the council — is a big step in the right direction for the FA’s anti-discrimination efforts. 

But the FA must try to make England’s travelling support membership more diverse. It was very noticeable in Tallinn that the fans following England were almost all white.

The FA have yet to decide on their base in France for Euro 2016, but the priority is that the hotel and training base should be on the same complex or very close together. 

The trouble in Brazil wasn’t just the hour-plus journey between the two, but the huge difficulty of a second visit later in the day without a police escort.

England fans in Tallinn on Sunday again voiced their considerable upset at the FA switching the double value of points/caps from supporters attending away games to home Wembley matches, with filling the national stadium the main concern of the FA. 

This thinking makes it all the more unlikely the FA will take England on the road — with the governing body aware that taking the odd unattractive fixture elsewhere might be viewed as condescending.

Roy Keane has been brutally honest in his book, but legend in Ireland has it there was a lot more to his flare-up with Jon Walters at Ipswich after he was dropped and stripped of the captaincy when agitating for a move to Stoke than a bit of ‘effing and blinding and pushing and shoving’.

Walters, it’s alleged, told Keane he knew where he lived and was coming to get him. Keane promptly wrote something down and thrust the piece of paper at Walters. It was his home address.

Once Star India and Star Middle East had agreed a global deal of over £1.5billion for eight years of the ICC World Cup, Twenty20 and Champions Trophy tournaments from 2015, Sky Sports were always going to beat off rivals BT for the UK rights with Rupert Murdoch being a part-owner of the Star group. 

BT, who would have gained the rights if the ICC had gone for the territory-by-territory option, will now have to wait until 2019 to compete against Sky for England Test cricket. 

Sky, who will pay Star around £150m, have been intent on closing doors on BT’s entry into other sports since the blockbuster loss to them of the Champions League. 

Meanwhile BT plan to present some of next season’s Champions League matches from newspaper offices around Europe to tap into the knowledge of football journalists. 

The planned initiative demonstrates that despite the rise of social media, old-fashioned print journalism is still the best-informed medium.
