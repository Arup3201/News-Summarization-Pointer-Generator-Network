Susan Parkin, 73, was given just a four per cent chance of survival and spent six days in intensive care, fighting for her life after the ordeal 

A pensioner suffering a brain anerusym was given just a four per cent chance of survival after being refused an ambulance by the dedicated NHS computer system. 

Susanne Parkin's husband Michael called 999 after she woke at 2am with an excruciating pain in her head and started drifting in and out of consciousness.

But she was not deemed an emergency and later spent six days in hospital fighting for her life. 

Despite attempting to outline the seriousness of the situation, Mr Parkin was told by the call operator that it wasn't necessary to rush his 73-year-old wife to hospital and advised him to call out their doctor.

A nurse from the local GP practice came out at breakfast time and almost immediately told Mr Parkin to drive his wife to hospital as it would be quicker than waiting for an ambulance.

By the time the pensioner arrived at hospital she was unconscious. She underwent emergency surgery and spent six days in intensive care after being diagnosed with a ruptured brain aneurysm.

Doctors later told her she had been given just a four per cent chance of survival.

Mrs Parkin, from Corfe Mullen, Dorset, is the second person to slam the NHS's so-called 'computer says no' triage system it uses to assess emergency cases.

Last week the widow of taxi driver Bill McLaughlin spoke out after he was refused an ambulance by the same ambulance - only to be rushed to hospital eight hours later and died of heart failure.

The ambulance service's triage system involves a call handler asking the person questions about their condition and inputting the answers into a computer which 'listens out' for key words and decides whether to send an ambulance.

Despite the NHS website describing a ruptured brain aneurysm as a 'medical emergency' and Mrs Parkin describing two of the four main symptoms to the operator, the South Western Ambulance Trust maintains it was right to refer her to the out-of-hours GP service.

Mrs Parkin said: 'I woke up with the most terrible pain and asked my husband to call an ambulance. I was very aware that it was not a normal headache, we told them about the pain and the stiff neck.

'The operator insisted on speaking to me even though I was going in and out of consciousness and then they said they wouldn't send an ambulance.

'I didn't answer in what they considered the right way so I didn't tick the right boxes that would make them come out. But neither of us remember them offering the out-of-hours GP service.

In a written reply, ambulance trust bosses admitted the handling Mr Parkin's 999 call had fallen well short of standards and apologised for the lapse in service.

'I was told so many times in hospital I should have died and how lucky I was. I had a four per cent chance of living and my doctor said it was as serious as it gets. If that isn't an emergency I don't know what is.

'I can't fault the doctors and nurses, they were superb, but I'm upset with the ambulance service. All the delay because they didn't come out caused a lot of problems.

'I learned of Bill McLaughlin's case and realised it was almost identical to what I had experienced. I didn't know until then that the decision was made by a computer and I was totally outraged.

'I don't think the general public are aware that these decisions are made by a computer. It's entirely ridiculous to judge humans like this and not help someone if they don't tick the right boxes.

'I was lucky but the other poor woman lost her husband. It's just wrong that this system is in place.'

Following Mrs Parkin's ordeal her husband Michael wrote to South Western Ambulance Service to complain about their treatment of his wife.

NHS Pathways is a software used by the NHS to to classify public calls for medical care and emergency medical services - such as 999 or 112 calls.

It is used by six ambulance trusts in the UK.

The main idea behind the system is to reduce unnecessary call-outs for emergency services.

It is diagnosed to deal with any health problem and refer the patient to the appropriate service 

The idea is that any healthcare problem can be triaged by any arm of the NHS - emergency or non-emergency - and can be directed to any possible health care provider without the need for a second triage on referral, or any delay.

In a written reply, trust bosses admitted the handling Mr Parkin's 999 call had fallen well short of their standards and apologised for the lapse in service.

The letter read: 'The triage of the 999 call for your wife has been carefully reviewed and audited by the Trust's QI team who have determined that the actions of the EMA taking the call did not meet the expected standard.

'To pass a quality audit, the triage of a 999 call must achieve a percentage 'score' of 86 per cent.

'The 999 call for your wife achieved 59 per cent, significantly lower than the standards expected by the Trust and I would like to specifically apologise again for the standard of this service.' 

In a press statement, the Trust said: 'South Western Ambulance Service is sorry that Mr Parkin felt the need to complain about the service he received following a 999 call for his wife back in May this year.

'The Trust acknowledges that some aspects of the call could have been handled better and actions have been taken to address this. However, the outcome of assessing Mrs Parkin’s symptoms was that an out-of-hours GP should call within two hours.

'This was the correct and appropriate response to the call, which Mr and Mrs Parkin chose not to accept.

'The triage system (NHS Pathways) used by our 999 call-handlers is a robust, national system, designed by clinicians to determine the most appropriate care pathway for patients.

'Emergency ambulances are for immediately life-threatening emergencies only. If a patient is not thought to be suffering a life-threatening emergency, they can be re-triaged by a clinician (paramedic, emergency care practitioner, nurse or sometimes a doctor) in the control room to ensure that patient receives the right level of care for their current symptoms and condition.

'If it is deemed that a patient needs to speak with an out-of-hours GP, this will be organised by the Trust – there is no expectation for the patient to make that arrangement themselves.

'Callers are always advised to call back on 999 if the patient’s condition deteriorates.'

The family of a man who died after he was refused an ambulance claimed last week he lost his life because an NHS ‘computer said no’.

Taxi driver Bill McLaughlin dialled 999 at 5am he was finding it hard to breathe.

But after putting his details into a computer an operator told him he did not need an ambulance. 

Bill McLaughlin, 55, died after being refused an ambulance - despite telling the operator he was struggling to breathe

The 55-year-old, a former merchant seaman, had been ill for three weeks and had seen five doctors about swelling after a change in his blood pressure medication.

It has now emerged he did not give the answers that ‘trigger’ the need for an ambulance and was told to contact his GP instead.

Mr McLaughlin died four days later, on September 1. A post-mortem examination found fluid around his body had caused heart failure.

His family demanded to know why an ambulance had not been sent in the first place, from a station just three minutes from his home in Bridport, Dorset.

They were told a computer system had decided neither an ambulance nor immediate hospital admission was necessary. 

The ‘computer says no’ catchphrase was coined by comedian David Walliams in the BBC’s Little Britain, in which a worker inputs data and then informs a customer they cannot be helped.
