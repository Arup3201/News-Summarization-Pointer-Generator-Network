Karl Lagerfeld’s Siamese cat Choupette is the inspiration behind an new Shu Uemura make-up line, and new details have emerged about the feline-inspired items.

In what is likely the first collaboration between a beauty brand and a house pet, the holiday collection, launching this fall, is cheekily named Shupette. 

It features eye shadow in a shade similar to the cat's blue peepers and false eyelashes adorned with pink feathers, silver highlights and crystals, according to WWD.

The range also includes cleansing oil, an under-base mousse, eye and lip palettes, glitter powder, blush compacts, a brush set, a silver makeup trunk, nail enamel and an eyelash curler with a Choupette charm in the shape of a stamp. 

Packaging for the products will include Mr Lagerfeld's sketches of the cat, who has been featured in fashion magazines including Harper's Bazaar and i-D.

Shu Uemura’s International Artistic Director, Kakuyasu Uchiide, also designed four 'cat eye' looks in honor of the collection.

A spoof Twitter account, called @ChoupettesDiary that is operated by a New York City-based fashion writer, helped catapult the feline to fame in 2012 and currently holds more than 40,000 followers.

The chic cat is also the subject of a new lifestyle book, Choupette: The Private Life of a High-Flying Fashion Cat, which was released today.

Mr Lagerfeld, 80, first acquired Choupette in 2011. He was babysitting the fluffy pet for friend and Chanel model Baptiste Giabiconi over Christmas and was reluctant to give her back upon his return.

This is not the first time Mr Lagerfeld has teamed up with Shu Uemura on a line of make-up.

In 2012, the designer created a holiday collection for the brand, based upon a cartoon he created called Mon Shu.

Mr Lagerfeld has long been known to use Shu Uemura make-up to create his fashion sketches for Chanel and Fendi, as well as his own label.
