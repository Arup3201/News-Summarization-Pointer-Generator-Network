Jailed: Kweku Adoboli was convicted of two counts of fraud after abusing his position at UBS

Swiss banking giant UBS has been fined £29.7million by the City watchdog for failings which allowed rogue trader Kweku Adoboli to lose £1.4billion.

The Financial Services Authority (FSA) said procedures, management systems and internal controls at the bank’s London branch were 'seriously defective'.

Adoboli was sentenced to seven years in prison last week after he was convicted of two counts of fraud by abuse of position.

Tracey McDermott, FSA director of enforcement and financial crime, said: 'UBS’s systems and controls were seriously defective.'

She said: 'As a result, Adoboli, a relatively junior trader, was allowed to take vast and risky market positions, and UBS failed to manage the risks around that properly.

'We know from past experience that failures to manage risk properly can cause firms to fail and cause systemic harm.'

UBS became aware that unauthorised trading had taken place on the Exchange Traded Funds Desk in London on September 14 last year.

Adoboli disguised the underlying positions by the use of late bookings of real trades and the booking of fictitious trades.

At one point the former public school
 head boy driven by a 'lust for wealth' was on the verge of losing the 
Swiss bank £7.5billion, which prosecutors said would have led to its 
collapse.

Sasha Wass QC told jurors that he was 'a gamble or two away from destroying Switzerland's largest bank for his own gain'.

The £1.4billion loss he caused - 
revealed when Adoboli sent a bombshell email to colleagues - wiped 
around 10% - £2.8billion - off UBS's share price.

The FSA, in an investigation with the
 Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (Finma), uncovered several
 'particularly serious' failings which put wider market confidence at 
risk and allowed Adoboli to commit financial crime.

The
 computerised system operated by UBS to assist in risk management was 
not effective, the regulators said, while its trade capture and 
processing system had 'significant deficiencies'.

Inadequate front office supervision was discovered including poorly executed and ineffective supervision arrangements within the GSE division.

Adoboli was at one point on the verge of causing losses of $12billion (£7.5billion), and the hole he eventually left was the largest trading loss ever in British banking history.

Prosecutors claimed Adoboli - who was heavily involved in spread-betting in his spare time - was a gambler who believed he had the 'magic touch'.

The 32-year-old admitted the enormous losses but claimed he was pressured by staff to take risks, culminating in a catastrophe which wiped £2.8billion off the bank’s share value.

James Carlton, a partner specialising in areas of business crime and regulation at Fox Williams, said: 'This case illustrates that Kweku Adoboli, while "rogue", could not have achieved what he did without there being significant failings within the overall trading operations and UBS clearly accepts a degree of corporate culpability for this.

'This case continues to underline the need for all financial institutions to have in place, and to continually monitor, highly comprehensive control systems which effectively balance the conflicting needs between regulatory compliance and corporate profit.'

After being educated at the 
£26,000-a-year Ackworth School in West Yorkshire, Adoboli toyed with 
becoming a chemical engineer. But he accepted an offer from the 
University of Nottingham to study a degree in e-commerce and digital 
business.

After graduating he was lured to UBS 
with tales of the millions that could be made. Despite his penchant for 
partying, he did well at the bank and was transferred from the back 
office to a trading desk in 2006.

He was given a £360,000 package of salary and bonuses, promoted to a crack ‘Delta One’ team within UBS and put in charge of a £30billion trading book.

The banker used his salary to fund the freewheeling lifestyle typical of a brash City trader, holding raucous parties at his £1,000-a-week loft apartment.

But it was there that his ‘naked gambling’ ran out of control. He wiped £2.8billion off the bank’s share price and threatened the jobs of many of his colleagues as the City struggled to recover from the recession.

A police officer who investigated the fraud said Adoboli’s actions were ‘felt in financial centres around the world’.

His losses would have been enough to pay a year’s salary for 70,000 nurses or build six hospitals.

They also dwarf the £827million lost by rogue trader Nick Leeson, who brought down Barings Bank in the early 1990s.
