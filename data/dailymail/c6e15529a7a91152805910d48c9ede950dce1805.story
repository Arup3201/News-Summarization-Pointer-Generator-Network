The Queen comforted the grieving family of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher as they left her funeral today

Queen Elizabeth and her 
husband Prince Philip, who know all too well the grief of losing a beloved family member, spoke to the Thatcher family outside St Paul's Cathedral.

She smiled reassuringly as she spoke to Carol Thatcher, Sir Mark Thatcher, his wife Sarah and children Michael and Amanda.

The Monarch was attending the first funeral of a British 
leader since Sir Winston Churchill died in 1965.

Amanda, Margaret Thatcher's only 
granddaughter, had earlier paid a heartfelt tribute to the former Prime Minister 
with a perfectly-delivered reading during the funeral.

Speaking
 with a pronounced American accent, the 19-year-old read from the 
book of Ephesians to mourners in St Paul's Cathedral.

The
 teenager showed how she takes after her grandmother as she spoke with 
self-assurance and confidence during the service in front of the Queen, 
former Prime Ministers and foreign dignitaries.

Her father Sir Mark, her aunt Carol and the rest of the Thatcher family watched from the front row of the Cathedral.

Standing behind her grandmother's 
coffin which had a Union Jack draped over it, Amanda read the reading which had been chosen 
by Mrs Thatcher before her death.

The teenager - whose middle name is Margaret - sat next to her older brother Michael, 24, during the service. The two siblings are Mrs Thatcher's only two grandchildren.

Sir Mark sat with his second wife Sarah while the former Prime Minister's daughter Carol was accompanied by her ski instructor partner Marco Grass.

Amanda's reading, from the book of the Ephesians, chapter 6 verses 10 to 18, called for the righteous to put 'on the whole armour of God that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil'.

The
 reading continued: 'For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but 
against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the 
darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.'

She was wearing a wide-brimmed asymmetric black hat with elegant detail and had on a single string of pearls.

The university student was followed by current Prime Minister David Cameron who did the only other reading.

At Mrs Thatcher's request, 
music by British composers was played at the beginning and end of the 
service, and the hymns reflected aspects of her life.

Later Sir Mark Thatcher, his wife and children Michael and Amanda attended a post-funeral reception at the Lord Mayorâ€™s official residence.

Sir Mark put an arm around his 
children Amanda and Michael as they entered the building alongside his 
sister Carol, who was there with her partner Marco Grass, a ski 
instructor.

The young Miss Thatcher, and her brother flew to Britain at the weekend from Dallas, Texas, where they live with their 
mother Diane Beckett, Sir Mark's first wife.

It was the birth of Michael in 1989 
that led to Baroness Thatcher uttering the now famous line 'We have 
become a grandmother' outside 10 Downing Street.

Amanda is studying at university in Richmond, Virginia,
 and appears to have inherited some of the traits of her famous 
grandmother.

When she graduated from school last year, she was voted the
 most likely to 'change the world' by her peers.

She is said to be an excellent runner
 and was captain of the girl's track team, sang in the choir and 
continues to enjoy horse-riding.

Her brother Michael, a successful high school football player, is a committed Christian and conservative, who
 graduated from Texas A&M University in chemistry, the same subject 
Baroness Thatcher studied at Oxford.

He works at a store and pharmacy in Texas, handing out prescriptions as well as snacks and cosmetics, but has been tipped to one day follow his grandmother into politics.

He has previously worked for a Republican-aligned political group that aims to 'educate and empower the Hispanic community with conservative values'.

Michael became a successful high 
school America football player after picking up the sport when he moved 
to Dallas in 2004. In 2007 he helped his high school team into the Texas
 state finals.

At the age of 18, he took a brilliant diving catch from a looping 48-yard pass in front of 10,000 fans.

Michael was last publicly photographed
 with his grandmother as he looked at her with concern etched on his 
young face as she wept outside the memorial service of her late husband,
 Sir Denis Thatcher, in 2003.

Finally, my brothers, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.

For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.

Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.

Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness; And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.

And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God: Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints.
