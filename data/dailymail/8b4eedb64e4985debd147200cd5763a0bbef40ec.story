Former West Brom defender Liam Ridgewell has joined Portland Timbers in the Major Soccer League.

The 29-year-old was released by the Baggies at the end of the season and has decided to pursue a new career in the United States.

Once his international clearance is received he will occupy one of the club's international slots and is their third designated player (those allowed above the salary cap) in the squad.

'Moving into the summer transfer window it was no secret we were looking to strengthen our squad with a top-level defender and we are extremely pleased to announce the signing of Liam Ridgewell,' head coach Caleb Porter told timbers.com.

'Liam is still in his prime at only 29 years old and he's been playing game in and out in the English Premier League versus many of the top attacking players in the world.

'This pedigree, along with his leadership qualities and technical ability as a left-sided central defender, makes him an ideal choice to enhance our backline for the second half of the season and beyond.'

Portland's general manager Gavin Wilkinson claimed they secured Ridgewell's services ahead of a number of Premier League sides.

'After attending a recent match at Providence Park Liam was incredibly taken by the fans and atmosphere generated here in Portland and, despite receiving several attractive offers to stay in the Premier League, chose the Timbers due to his belief in the vision and football philosophy of the organisation,' he said.
