This week I've come back to reality with a bit of bump and realised it's time for a healthier outlook on life.

I came back from Secret Garden Party music festival on Monday feeling a bit jaded and in need of a detox.

So I've decided to try to cut back on the drinking and I am starting back with my gym instructor Shaun Stafford next week.

On the wagon: Spencer says he is laying off alcohol and turning to shellfish for his protein-fueled health kick

Day one of my new health kick and on Tuesday I managed to catch up with my old pal Hugo Taylor at Harvey Nichols Fifth Floor restaurant. It was a beautiful summer's day and it was so tempting to join him for a glass or three of a fine rose, but I resisted and opted for a fresh mint tea.

You can see me pictured wearing a pair of Hugo's very high-end Taylor Morris sunglasses - he has them on sale at Harvey Nics and they've been doing a roaring trade since actress and model Suki Waterhouse was spotted wearing a pair.

Hugo was impressed by my abstinence but wasn't too confident that my new 'tea-total' regime would last to the end of the week.

We parted company and I decided that a late lunch was in order at Colbert in Sloane Square - and opted for a dozen Jersey Rocks oysters, with a classic Mignonette sauce and Tabasco. They went down beautifully with a spicy Virgin Mary and after a dozen of these I was absolutely buzzing.

These whopping great molluscs are basically just a protein delivery device and with a relatively low amount of fat. I was raring to go after 12 of them - no wonder, as they're thought to be a natural aphrodisiac.

Finally wrapped the week off with a trip to Ping in Earls Court, the west London venue that combines nightclubbing with Ping Pong. I may have had a couple of drinks but it's all in moderation.

All the gang were there - Binky, Hugo, Louise Thompson and Josh Coombs - and they were playing a few games of Beer Pong. It has pretty simple rules: you line up a few glasses of beer at the end of each table and if the ball lands in the glass you drink the beer.

Thankfully I'm pretty good at table tennis so I stayed fairly sober but I have a major problem next week as it's my birthday - Wednesday 6th if you'd like to wish me well - and I may have to take one day out of my new monk-like existence.

Until then, it's all oysters and early nights. Well up to a point…

Lots of love, Spencer.
