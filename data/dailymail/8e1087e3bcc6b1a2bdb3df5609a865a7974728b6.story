A California woman who survived being shot in the leg when a gunman opened fire on her elementary school in 1989 has been charged with murder.

Sarim Chabb, one of 29 victims injured during the Stockton School attack, has appeared in court over the fatal shooting of a 22-year-old man.

Chabb, 31, and her brother, Sarth, were arrested on Sunday as police investigated the death of Marshawn Black, whose body was found the night before.

The siblings face several other gun-related charges as well as murder after Mr Black was allegedly shot during a dispute, News 10 reported.

Stockton police did not say how they came to suspect the Chabbs in the murder, but spokesman Joseph Silva said Sarim knew the victim.

Police discovered Black's body in an apartment after receiving reports of shots being fired at an apartment complex.

'It was basically just good old 
fashioned police work,' Mr Silva told ABC News. 'Just going to the apartment, 
talking to people and piecing the events that led up to the shooting 
together in a fast manner, which led them to the suspects.'

Sarim Chabb was one of the survivors of the 1989 school shooting, when 26-year-old Patrick Purdy fired 106 rounds from an assault rifle into a playground during recess.

At the time it was the worst school shooting in the U.S and raised questions about the easy availability of high-powered weapons, Time reported.

Purdy, who had been a pupil at the school, wore ear plugs as he carried out his attack, and also used a petrol bomb to set fire to his car outside the school.

Five children died and 29 people, including Chabb, were injured in the three-minute ordeal which ended when Purdy killed himself.

Chabb's public defender said the connection was 'interesting but irrelevant' to the current case.

The siblings are due back in court on December 17.
