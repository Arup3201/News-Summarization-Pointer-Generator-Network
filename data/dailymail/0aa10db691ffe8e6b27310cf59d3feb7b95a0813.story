People living at Britain’s most exclusive addresses are just as likely to be drug addicts as those on Benefits Street, a Labour frontbencher has claimed.

Chris Bryant, the shadow welfare minister, said there were as many addicts living on The Bishops Avenue in London – known as Billionaires' Row – as on James Turner Street in Birmingham.

And he criticised the portrayal of people on the Channel 4 programme, insisting people on benefits are ‘not shoplifting’ but want to find work.

Benefits Street has been a huge hit for Channel 4, featuring some of the residents living on the street in Birmingham.

It has made stars of the likes of White Dee – a 42-year-old single mother who receives £200 a week in handouts and whose real is Deirdre Kelly.

During a live TV debate she attacked the government for creating a claimant culture - and said it is not her fault how much she is given.

She also accused Channel 4 of manipulating the residents of James Turner Street, in Birmingham.

White Dee appeared to be backed up by Mr Bryant, who said the portrayal of those on benefits as drug addicts and criminals was at odds with the reality.

Taking part in Mr Bryant said: ‘I thought to myself, if you went to the richest street in this country, which is Bishop’s Row [sic] in Hampstead, and there’s 99 houses, you’d find they have exactly the same number of people who are drug addicts, alcoholics and have exactly the same problems.’

The Bishop's Avenue in Hampstead is one of the most exclusive roads in Britain, home to leading businessmen and women, members of the Saudi royal family and the president of Kazakhstan.

Mr Bryant went on: 'There are 99 houses in that street and you would expect 50 of them would be pensioners.

'We didn't see them in the programme we just saw the people who were shoplifting.

‘My experience of people on benefits is they are not shoplifting they want to work.'

Conservative minister Mike Penning also accused the broadcaster of being unrealistic in their portrayal of life on benefits.

'You were very selective in your cuts. You were very very selective about what you did there,' he said.

'You picked on a certain group of people and you didn't really tell them the full truth about what you were going to do, I don't think.'

Millionairess Eva Rausing, 48 – the wife of Tetra Pak billionaire Hans Kristian Rausing – had been dead for eight weeks before her body was found in their £70 million London home in Cadogan Place, Belgravia, in July 2012.

Mr Rausing, 49, was given a ten-month suspended custodial sentence after admitting he denied her ‘a decent and lawful burial’.

He told a court he ‘suffered some sort of breakdown’ following her death.

The 49-year-old, whose family is the 12th richest in Britain and whose fortune comes from the £4.5billion Tetra Pak drinks carton empire, told psychiatrists after his arrest: 'I know it is sad and selfish, but I just didn’t want her to leave.'

In July 2012 David Brudenell-Bruce, the 8th Earl of Cardigan, was deemed mentally unfit to face charges of theft and criminal damage and taken from court to hospital by ambulance.

He was arrested for allegedly damaging pheasant feeders, stealing a battery and an electrical power unit.

Brudenell-Bruce, 59, is alleged to have caused £66 damage to a number of pheasant feeders belonging to James Tilly.

Marquis of Blandford Jamie Blandford, 57, was all but disinherited by his father the Duke of Marlborough after he battled addiction to heroin and cocaine – at one point spending £20,000 on cocaine in four months – and was twice imprisoned.

His father was so worried that he took legal action to stop his son from inheriting the family’s 11,500-acre Oxfordshire estate that was the birthplace of Winston Churchill.

A lengthy court battle led to a compromise that Blandford would inherit his father’s title on his death but a board of trustees, including his younger brother, would run the estate.

But now Blandford has been drug-free for years and father and son have seemingly put their differences behind them.

In 2012 the Marquess moved back on to the spectacular estate and been given a trusted role in its running.

White Dee, from Channel 4's Benefits Street, has attacked the programme's makers for their portrayal of those on the now-famous street

Benefits Street explored day-to-day life in James Turner Street, Winson Green, where, it is claimed, as many as 90 per cent of people claim benefits.

Many of the residents have become national celebrities as a result of the media coverage.

But the series proved controversial and Channel 4 received more than 200 complaints after the first episode.

It has attracted criticism for being ‘poverty porn’ and sensationalising the thorny issue of benefits, unemployment and housing.

A Sunday newspaper recently claimed Kelly is now so prized by Channel 4 that they offered her ‘thousands of pounds’ as an inducement not to take part in Big Brother, a rival Channel 5 show, and secure her services exclusively.

Ralph Lee, a Channel 4 producer, said: There are streets like James Turner streets up and down the country.'
