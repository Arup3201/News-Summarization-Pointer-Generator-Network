Vladimir Putin has been fighting the flab at a luxury Spanish health resort loved by Naomi Campbell and Kylie Minogue.

The Russian leader - involved in an ugly spat with Prince Charles - reportedly signed up to an anti-ageing and weight-loss programme at the Sha Wellness Clinic on the Costa Blanca.

Respected Spanish newspaper La Razon said Putin, who attacked the Prince of Wales on Saturday for comparing him to Hitler, turned up at the spa near Alicante with a group of models.

He is said to have stuck to a detox diet of whole cereal grains, beans, veg and a daily cup of miso soup during his stay, which followed Russia's annexation of Crimea in March.

It is not known how much his stay at the Sha, which features 93 suites set in Zen gardens with swimming pools and waterfalls, cost or how long it lasted.

A one night stay at the 320sq-metre Royal Suite, where guests are offered a heliport service, private parking and their own swimming pool, costs £4,850 a night.

The Presidential Suite, the next room down in luxury with a private terrace jacuzzi instead of a swimming pool, costs £1,600 a night.

Previous guests at the clinic, voted the seventh best spa in the world in an annual Conde Nast readers’ poll in 2010, have included Naomi Campbell, Kylie Minogue and Gwyneth Paltrow.

Russian Prime Ministry Dmitry Medvedev's wife Svetlana and son Ilia spent eight days at the five-star health hotel in Alfaz del Pi in November 2010.

MailOnline Travel contacted Sha for a comment.

Putin, 61, a keen sportsman who has waged wars on smoking and vodka, has been ridiculed for holiday snaps where he is pictured riding bare chested on a horse and swimming in a river.
