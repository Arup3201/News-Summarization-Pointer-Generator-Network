Wal-mart heiress Alice Walton is requesting a 2011 driving while intoxicated arrest to be expunged from her record, and prosecutors say she's likely to get her way.

The charges against Walton, 63, were dropped last month since the arresting officer wouldn't be able to testify.

According to the Texas Department of Public Safety, the state trooper that arrested Walton has been suspended pending an internal investiation into allegations of misconduct. The two-year statue of limitations on the charges expired on October 7.

Like it never happened: 63-year-old Walmart heiress Alice Walton is requesting that a 2011 DWI arrest be taken off her record, and Parker County, Texas prosecutors say she will likely get her way

'The case is not that credible, which is probably a reason it was laying around for a while,' said Fred Barker, assistant prosecutor for Parker County.

Mr Barker wouldn't elaborate on specifics of the case and it's credibilty. He did say however, that by next month, it can't be used against Walton.

'It will cease to exist for us in any way - literally,' Barker said. 'We would not even acknoledge it ever existed nor that it was expunged, or that we ever talked to you about it.

'There's really no way to stop it,' he said. 'Once that's done, it's gone, gone, gone.'

Walton was arrested on her 62nd birthday when she was stopped at an Intestate in Parker County Texas for a traffic violation.

Texas Highway patrol Trooper Gary Rozzell said at the time: 'Through an investigation at the scene, Walton was determined to be intoxicated during a field sobriety test.'

He also said she refused a breath test, according to the Weatherford Democrat.

She was booked and released on $1,000 bond.

A statement from a family spokesman said: 'Ms Walton was pulled over by a patrolman with the Department of Public Safety for driving 71 mph in an unattended 55 mph construction zone.

'She was returning home from a birthday dinner with friends at a Fort Worth restaurant. She accepts full responsibility for this unfortunate incident and deeply regrets it.'

The DUI arrest was not Waltonâ€™s first.

According to information from the Springdale District Court in Arkansas, Walton was convicted of driving under the influence in a 1998 case. According to the UK's Independent, she hit a gas meter and told the responding police officer: 'I'm Alice Walton, bitch!'

She paid a several hundred dollar fine in that case, according to other news reports and served no jail time.

No previous conviction showed up on her criminal history so Walton was charged Friday with a first offence DWI, according to Rozzell.

Previous news accounts state Walton was also involved in a 1989 wreck in Arkansas that resulted in the death of a 50-year-old woman.

No charges were filed at that time.

In October 2012 Walton was worth about $27 billion, making her the second-richest American woman, tenth-richest American and 14th richest person in the world.

Walton purchased her first piece of art when she was about ten years old and this interest led to her spearheading the Walton Family Foundation's involvement in developing Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art.

She has spent over $300million building an American art museum in Arkansas, and the facilities alone cost over $100mllion.
