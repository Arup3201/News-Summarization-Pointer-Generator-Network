Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton faced a furious backlash shortly after he was crowned BBC Sports Personality of the Year.

Hamilton's victory was the seventh time a Formula One driver has won the award as he beat golfer Rory McIlroy  by more than 85,000 votes.

But within minutes of receiving the award amid a standing ovation from guests at the event in Glasgow, the racing driver was being attacked on social media for his status as a tax exile.

Furious Twitter users took the site to vent their fury that someone who ‘doesn’t even have TV license’ should win such a prestigious BBC award.

One person to voice his opinion was QPR midfielder Joey Barton, who wrote: ‘Can't believe they gave SPOTY to Hamilton. 1. Formula 1 is the most boring sport ever. 2. He brought a dog with him. 3. He's a tax exile.'

Barton continued: 'Tax exile's should be exempt from winning trophies paid and voted for by the tax/licence payer. He should never have won. He is a terrible role model to any Britain. What precedent does that set. Bad day in our history'

Hamilton moved to the exclusive tax haven state of Monaco in 2012 after several years living in Switzerland. 

He has tackled the accusations of being a tax exile in the past. Speaking to Sunday Times Style magazine before the awards ceremony, he said: People moan and say, "He doesn't live in the country, but he's happy to raise the flag." It doesn't matter what country you live in. I was born here, man. But it's the tax thing, isn't it?

'What people don't realise is that I pay tax here, but I don't earn all my money here. I race in 19 different countries, so I earn my money in 20 different places and I pay tax in several different places, and I pay a lot here as well. I am contributing to the country and, not only that, I help keep a team of more than 1,000 people employed. I am part of a much bigger picture.'

Earlier in the evening, Hamilton, 29, was joined on the red carpet by his pet bulldog Roscoe

But despite the controversy, with 209,920 public votes, Hamilton’s victory over second place McIlroy was decisive.

The golfer, who was the favourite of many to win the award, trailed behind with 123,745 votes while long distance runner Jo Pavey came third with 99,913 votes.

Earlier in the evening, Hamilton, 29, was joined on the red carpet not by his glamorous singer girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger but by his pet bulldog Roscoe, much to the amusement of fans.

Speaking during the ceremony, Hamilton said his family were his inspiration and paused to hug his younger brother Nicholas before collecting his trophy.

He said: ‘I’m so proud and honoured to be among such great sporting talent. I want to say a huge thank you to all the people who called in, I really wasn’t expecting it.

‘I could not have done this without my amazing team, my family, my dad who once had four jobs to help me, my brother.

Hamilton won his second Formula 1 world title last month after edging an often controversial battle with Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg when he clinched the crown with victory at Abu Dhabi

‘I’ve been incredibly inspired by them. I never thought in a million years I’d be surrounded by such people.

‘Thank you to all the fans. I always say we win and lose together because I feel your love. I feel so proud to carry the Union flag and hope I will continue to make you proud.’
