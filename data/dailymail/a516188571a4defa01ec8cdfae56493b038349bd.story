An unemployed man who grabbed Â£25,000 from a security guard because he could not afford a birthday card for his wife has been jailed for 26 months.

Richard Blake, 36, wanted to 'make a quick buck' when he realised he only had 63p to celebrate with his partner of 13 years.

Blake, who had been out of work for a month, robbed a cash-in-transit guard as he delivered funds to a branch of Lloyds TSB in Sydenham, south London.

He grabbed a cashbox from the unsuspecting guard, who had been delayed from entering the bank as he had let an elderly woman customer through the door in Sydenham Road.

No violence was used and he was able to flee the scene on foot.

Blake carried out the robbery on his wife Heather's birthday, at 11.40am on January 25 this year.

He then called his friend Clement Benjamin, 41, to pick him up. Benjamin then used an angle grinder to force open the box in his back garden in Croydon, but only managed to cover himself and the cash in purple dye.

Blake was arrested later that afternoon after neighbours had witnessed suspicious activity in and around Benjamin's home.

Benjamin, a plumber and qualified gas engineer, was picked up when he rang Blake's mobile during the arrest.

Blake pleaded guilty to robbery on what was due to be the first day of a trial at the Old Bailey.

Jailing him, the Recorder of London, Judge Peter Beaumont QC: 'Those who deliver cash to banks undertake a risky job and deserve the support of the court when they are attacked.

'The only way that support can be given in real terms is by imposing a custodial sentence.'

Benjamin, who told officers in interview 'greed got the better of me', admitted assisting an offender and was jailed for six months.

Manisha Knights, defending, said Blake had become 'frustrated at numerous attempts to secure work' in January after finishing a year of temporary contracts through an agency in December.

He has previously worked in customer services at both the Glades shopping centre in Bromley and Lakeside in Essex.

She said Blake, who has a seven-year-old son with his wife, was so ashamed that he could not afford anything for her that he committed the 'impulsive offence'.

'He put himself in a position where he saw the cash in transit custodian and saw an opportunity to make a quick buck and he took it,' said Miss Knights.

'He had been unable to find work. He started to panic regarding his finances. On the day he had greeted his wife and wished her a happy birthday. He had 63p to his name and felt ashamed he could not even buy her a card that day.

'He is extremely ashamed and embarrassed by his actions.'

Blake, the eldest of three brothers who also has another child from a previous relationship, has left his wife struggling to cope with a full-time job as a catering assistant in Croydon, childcare and the family finances, it was said.

Benjamin, who has two children and a long-term partner, has repeatedly run in to trouble for driving while disqualified.

Blake, of Penge, southeast London, has served six months on remand. He will be released on licence after completing half of his 26-month sentence.

Benjamin, of Croydon, will serve three months of his six-month term before being released.
