Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard’s moves to America have been shrouded in uncertainty with Major League Soccer facing a player strike.

The season is set to kick off in less than two weeks, but the players’ union is at loggerheads with the league and the players are prepared to refuse to turn out for their clubs.

Lampard is set to join New York City and Gerrard LA Galaxy in the summer when the Premier League season is over.

The MLS and the MLS Players Union are locked in negotiations regarding terms that the players work under.

But despite remaining in talks for several months, it is understood the two parties are not even close to coming to agreement on the season ahead.

The MLSPU want players to have the option of becoming free agents and to increase their current salary cap.

Sources in America have indicated that there is a very real possibility that if an agreement is not reached then players will be forced not to play for their clubs when the league is supposed to start on March 6.

Lampard will begin his two-year deal at New York City in July and Gerrard has signed an 18-month contract at LA Galaxy due to start the same month.

It will be midway through the MLS season, but both players are expected to play a key part in their clubs’ season.

But that has been thrown into doubt with the very real possibility of strike action going ahead.

Player strike action is more common in the US. The NBA was delayed starting by six months in 2011 and there were lengthy delays to the NFL kicking off in the 1970s and 1980s. There have also been major strikes in baseball and ice hockey.
