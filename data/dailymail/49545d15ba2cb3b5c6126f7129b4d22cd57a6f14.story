A 16-year-old boy is in an induced coma following a tackle that caused him a serious head injury during a rugby league match in Bathurst on Thursday.

Bathurst High School Year 11 student Tyler Horton collapsed off the field during a game against another local school and had to be airlifted to Westmead Hospital.

Tyler's sister Emily Horton, 19, was at the game and witnessed the tackle.

'He tackled pretty hard and got up and shook it off but I knew it must have been a bit of a knock because he worked his way to the side line waiting to come off,' Miss Horton told MailOnline.

'I could see he knew something was wrong, he quickly became unconscious and hasn't come around.'

Miss Horton said Tyler was taken to Bathurst Hospital where he underwent scans and tests, and he was then was medically sedated and flown to Westmead Hospital.

He was later operated on to relieve pressure on his brain.

The Year 11 student plays rugby for the Bathurst High School team and he was on the field on Thursday afternoon when he suffered a horrific head injury

'He's stable and still sedated having more tests and we're just waiting to hear more,' Miss Horton said.

'That's as much as I know right now, we are just lucky to have so many people care and have had unbelievable doctors, nurses and support.'

Bathurst High School's principal Geoff Hastings said Tyler hit his head during the second half of the game on Thursday afternoon.

'We're not entirely sure but we think Tyler went into a tackle, it was just part of the normal flow of the game,' Mr Hastings told MailOnline.

'He came off the field and then collapsed.'

The teenager's sister, Emily Horton, said he was now in a stable condition at Westmead but was still sedated

A Westmead Hospital spokeswoman told MailOnline Tyler was in a critical but stable condition on Friday afternoon.

Mr Hastings said he had spoken to Tyler's parents who were dealing with the situation as best they could.

'Of course as any parent would if their child was hurt playing sport, they're worried and concerned,' he said.

'I think they're focused on his recovery... We've had very positive news about his recovery.'

Mr Hastings said the school had been working with Tyler's schoolmates to help them cope with the news.

'Obviously they're upset, concerned and want to know how he's going, all that you'd expect when your friend's in hospital' he said.

'But they're coping extremely well.'

Daily improvement: Curtis shown here recovering in Royal North Shore hospital

This comes less than three weeks after another young NRL player, Curtis Landers, was left paralysed by a horror tackle that fractured his c2 and c3 vertebrae.

Curtis is making small steps towards getting better, and is now swallowing and eating ice cream on his own as he recovers from his severe injuries. He has also started gym session and his arms and legs are improving.

Aaron Temple, president of Curtis' football club Forster-Tuncurry Hawks, said his stint in hospital would be long-term.

'He's looking at 12 months in hospital,' he told MailOnline.
