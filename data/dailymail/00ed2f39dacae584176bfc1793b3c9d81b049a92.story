A Brazilian city is facing an unusual crime spree - where the criminals are called John Lennon.

Police in Belo Horizonte have arrested three bandits bearing the Beatles starâ€™s name in little over a month - and found the body of a fourth after a suspected revenge killing.

The phenomenon has been blamed on the popularity of the band in Brazil - leading to thousands of mothers to name their newborn sons after him in the years after he was shot in 1980.

Decades later, many of those offspring are now finding themselves in trouble with the police.

The most recent arrest came on Friday, when John Lennon Ribeiro Siqueira, 19, was caught as he prepared to rob a lottery shop in the the city, the capital of Minas Gerais state in south-east Brazil.

'He was armed and dangerous', a police spokesman said.

Meanwhile, John Lennon Fonseca Ferreira, 22 - described by police as one of the most wanted criminals in the state - was arrested during an attempted robbery at a house in the city on January 8.

And on December 19, police arrested John Lenon Camargos Gomes, 22, who is accused of five murders in Belo Horizonte.

The convicted drug trafficker is also accused of two attempted murders.

Some John Lennons are even less lucky. On January 9, the body of John Lennon Sebastiao da Silva, 18, was found in the back seat of a car in the city.

Police have arrested a suspect and believe it was a revenge killing.
