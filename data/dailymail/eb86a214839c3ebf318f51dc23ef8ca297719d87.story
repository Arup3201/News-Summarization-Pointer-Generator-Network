A girl born with no eyes or nose is just days away from a surgery that will give her a nose.

Born with no eyes and no nose, Cassidy Hooper, 17, of Charlotte, NC, will have an operation that will graft bone or cartilage from another part of her body before stretching skin over the area to create a nose. The final surgery is scheduled for Sept 18.

The high school senior has already gone through two other surgeries this summer that prepared her for the final step, after which she will finally have a nose.

Surgery in June: Cassidy Hooper underwent surgery in last month that heralded her final operation to have a nose attached to her face

Almost finished: Ms Hooper's brave journey through a dozen surgeries meant to construct her face is almost complete

Ms Hooper told ABC News she is excited that she will soon be able to breath and smell through her nose.

'I'll have a real nose like everyone else's,' the brave girl said.

Her father couldn't be happier.

It's been a long process, but the day has finally come,' her father, J. Aaron Cassidy,48, told ABC. 'Cassidy is certainly excited for this day to be here.'

Ms Hooper has had numerous procedures performed since she turned 11-yeard-old, but the courageous girl has kept a positive spirit thoughout.

'Things always may be hard,' she told ABC. 'But here's what I think: I don't need easy, I just need possible.'

An operation in June moved Cassidy's eyes closer together while taking a section of her forehead bone, folding it down and also pulling enough skin downwards to create enough necessary for the bone to be implanted and create a nose at the end of the month.

Her prosthetic eyes, which she's had since birth, need to be replaced, but they will not happen right away, her mother told ABC.

'Insurance didn't pay one cent,' her mother lamented. 'We had already started the process to do her nose, moving her eyes closer together and having her skull reshaped. We were not going to pay for it then have to pay again.'

The prosthetic eyes cost $10,000 per pair, according to ABC.

Ready for One More Operation: Cassidy talks to a reporter from WBTV - clearly visible is the patch of skin surgically pulled down from her forehead - at the end of July bone from a rib will be inserted as the final piece of her new nose

Slightly Tender: Cassidy Hooper described her boneless nose as slightly painful and described her excitement that the whole process is almost over

The young role model and her family spoke to a local television station earlier this summer.

Telling WBTV that the surgery has left her in some pain, a bandage-covered Cassidy said that she was looking forward to her years of surgery coming to an end.

'I was actually thinking of what the reaction of everyone would be when that last surgery finished,' she said. 'And I think everyone's going to be so excited.'

Friends of the Hooper family have recently established a website to help with Cassidy's mounting medical bills. 

Susan says insurance covers 80% of what's 'reasonable and customary'.  The other 20% is left to the Hooper family.  To get more information or help, go to www.CassidyHooper.org.

And the good news has left the energetic teen ecstatic because for the first time she will be able to smell and breathe through her own nose.

Cassidy Hooper is preparing for surgery to give her a real nose built from cartilage and bones from her ribs after five-years of preparations

When she was born, her condition left doctors baffled, especially since had no other medical problems and leads a healthy life.

'Her heart and brain are normal,' said her mother, kindergarten teacher, Susan Hooper to ABC News.

'Nothing else is going on with her.'

The inspirational teenager has been going through skin graft surgeries to adapt her face since she was 11 years old and is pleased to be entering the final straight.

'I'll have a real nose like everyone else's,' said Cassidy of her July surgery.

Born with no nose or eyes, doctors have never answered why she was born that way - but believe that she did not develop them in the first two weeks of pregnancy in her mother's womb

Her surgeon, Dr. David Matthews has worked for the past five years expanding her face to create a bony opening.

Experts who spoke to ABC News explained how the surgery to replace Cassidy's nose will be completed.

'The nose is a little like the ear -- 
what you see isn't functional,' said Dr. Sherard A. Tatum III, director 
of facial and reconstructive surgery at Upstate Golisano Children's 
Hospital in Syracuse, N.Y. 

The surgery will take place at Levine Children's Hospital in Charlotte and will be overseen by Dr. David Matthews (right)

'A lot of people have noses they lost to trauma and cancer and breathe fine and have a sense of smell. The nose is something we expect to see in its conventional place and it's good to put glasses on, but it's not 100 percent necessary.'

'The soft tissues that make up the inside and the outside skin and mucus membrane don't have a lot of strength to stick out of the face like the nose does. You can't just slap some skin up there and make it look like a nose.'

Cassidy's doctors have taken a layered 
approach - placing the inside membrane first, then using cartilage and 
bone from her skull create a nose structure and then cover it with skin.

Cassidy hopes one day for a career in radio and has recently spent time at her local radio station for experience

The hardest part for Cassidy has been overcoming the social difficulties.

She has been attending Governor Morehead School, a specialist school for the blind since the fifth grade and deals with taunts from children well.

'Honestly, there's been a bit of teasing, but not more than any other child on a regular day,' said her mother.
