At least fifty children have fallen ill after playing in a water park earlier this week.

As the school holidays began, hundreds of families visited Bretton Water Park in Peterborough which has now been forced to close after reports of sick children began streaming in.

Peterborough City council, which owns the water park say all maintenance and cleaning records are up to date but that the park will remain closed for public safety.

Bug: At least fifty children have fallen ill after playing at Bretton Water Park in Peterborough

The council also said even more youngsters may have gone down with fever, diarrhoea and upset stomachs because reports are still coming in.

The park has been closed since Thursday afternoon after children began to fall ill having visited it in the last few days.

One mum, Lindsey Ambler, 36, of Orton Brimbles, near Peterborough, said all four of her children – Chloe, 13, Megan, 11, Charlotte, 9, and Luca aged seven - plus her three nieces have been sick after visiting the water park this week.

When they visited the park on Monday she noticed the water was "cloudy" and days later her children were all vomiting, running to the toilet and clutching their tummies.

‘ I scooped up some water in a bucket and noticed that it looked cloudy.

‘We didn't think anything would be seriously wrong at the time but days later my youngest boy Luca was sick.

‘He has had a fever, diarrhoea and upset stomach and hasn't been able to sleep because he's worried about being ill again.’

Mrs Ambler added ‘My children are fit and healthy they are hardly ever off school, so being ill is a shock to their systems.

‘That says to me, as a parent, that whatever caused this is a pretty strong bug.

‘My kids have been totally hit for six and I just have to hope that they will recover quickly.’

Investigations into what caused to outbreak of illnesses are continuing, although it may be over a week until the results are known.

Another concerned parent, Georgina Farrow, of Werrington, said all three of her children have been sick.

‘They all visited the water park and were fine afterwards but have all had upset stomachs since.

‘As a parent I'm obviously keen to know what caused this and just how serious it is.’

Some parents reported their children have suffered rashes as well as the other symptoms.

Mother-of-two Tami Harris took her ten-year-old son Henry and nine-year-old daughter Georgina to the water park on Tuesday.

‘We had a lovely time. The park was absolutely heaving, because of the weather.

‘But since then my two children have been really ill, and I have heard of another 30 others who have been ill as well.

‘My son got a rash on his back and tummy, and then was sick through the night.

‘We went to the doctors, and they said they have never seen anything like the rash before.

‘Henry is still struggling to eat a couple of days later. He said that the water at the park was really cloudy and dirty, and if I had known that at the time I would have told them to get out.’

A spokeswoman for Peterborough City Council, said: ‘It is too early to say exactly what could have caused this bout of sickness.

‘Our environmental health officers are working closely with our colleagues at Enterprise Peterborough to investigate.

‘As soon as we received information we acted swiftly to close the park so that tests can be carried out on the water.

‘We have checked maintenance and cleaning records for the facility and can confirm that they are all up to date.

‘It is our priority to understand what has caused this problem and we will endeavour to re-open the park as soon as this has been addressed.

‘Given the hot weather we are keen to have the park open for the public to enjoy at the earliest possible date, however we must emphasise that public health and safety is our main priority.’
