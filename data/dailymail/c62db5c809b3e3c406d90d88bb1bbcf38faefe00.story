Time out: Prince William could be about to end his RAF career prematurely as he prepares for the arrival of his first child, it has emerged

Prince William could be about to end his RAF career prematurely as he prepares for the arrival of his first child, it has emerged.

Tomorrow will mark the end of the minimum period he was required to serve as a search and rescue pilot.

Although his three-year tour of duty is not due to end until September, with the Duchess of Cambridge due to give birth in July, he could leave the RAF within weeks.

This would give him extended paternity leave before starting the next stage of his career.

According to the Daily Telegraph, sources close to the Duke, 30, said he has not yet made up his mind on his immediate future.

His options include continuing to fly, transferring  elsewhere within the Armed Forces or completely ending his military career.

Speaking to the paper, a royal source said: 'He hasn't made a final decision yet on his future but he is there or thereabouts.

'His tour of duty can finish any time between the end of March and September and the expectation is that it will be over towards the latter half  of that period.'

A Ministry of Defence spokesman said the Duke had reached the stage in his service called tour review. It means he will sit down with his superiors to discuss his next step.

The spokesman added: 'The review happens about six months from the end of the tour.

'An individual might move on before the end date of their tour, depending on the availability of personnel, they may stay in post or they may even be asked to stay on longer, if required.

'There are no hard and fast rules.'

Change: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are expected to move out of the farmhouse where they have been able to live a normal life on Anglesey

However, it is thought extremely 
unlikely that the Duke will continue as a search and rescue pilot 
because another tour of duty would take him beyond March 2016.

Sources say, though, that it is certain he will not remain at RAF Valley on Anglesey. This means the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will move out of the farmhouse where they have been able to live a normal life.

One theory is that the Duke may ask for a transfer to Wattisham in Suffolk, which is home to an RAF Search and Rescue Squadron and is the base for Apache helicopters. His brother, Prince Harry, is also based there.
