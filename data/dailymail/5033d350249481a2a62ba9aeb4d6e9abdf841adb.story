A 45-year-old father-of-three who went begging with a 'homeless and hungry' sign around his neck while actually living in a terraced house was claiming £367.58 a week in benefits, a court has heard.

Andrew Dawick was neither hungry nor homeless and lived at his home in Blackpool with his family, the court heard.

But he would take to the streets of the seaside town with the sign and sit cross-legged with a pottery cup in front of him, begging for money.

Dawick was targeted by the local authority and police who wanted to remove 'professional' beggars from the seaside resort.

He admitted six offences of begging in a public place when he appeared at Blackpool Magistrates Court.

Lynda Bennett, prosecuting for Blackpool Council, said he was approached by police after he was seen holding his cup up towards passers-by.

He told officers: 'I need to do it to feed my kids - its better than robbing.'

On another day he told police: 'Get a real job'.

The prosecutor said Dawick, who also uses the name Dowick, would try and keep one step ahead of the authorities.

She said: 'He would wear a sign round his neck stating homeless and hungry.

'However
he does have a house and receives a series of benefits - council tax 
benefit, child tax credit, child allowance, housing benefit and 
Jobseekers Allowance.'

The court heard each time he was charged with illegal begging he had a potful of change in front of him.

Once he told an officer: 'I can’t get a job its not that easy. I have got to make money somehow.'

He would start to shout loudly at police and that caught the attention of passers-by. 

Sue Mugford, defending, said: 'My client turned to begging at the time he had a localised problem with his Jobseekers’ Allowance.'

She said there had been a period where his Jobseekers benefits stopped.

She said: 'That was because it was a joint claim with his partner and she had failed to keep an appointment at the Jobcentre. It has now been restored.'

Dawick was given a 12 month conditional discharge and ordered to pay £115 costs.

Judge Edward Barr told him he was restricted in how he could sentence him.

'If I fine you, the money will have to be deducted from your benefits and that could affect the welfare of your children.

'So, I am giving you a conditional discharge but there will be a small financial penalty - the costs.'
