The millionaire husband of former Congresswoman and Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris - who became known for the disputed presidential recount in 2000 - has committed suicide.

Anders Ebbeson, 68, was found dead at the couple's waterfront mansion in Sarasota on Tuesday morning after battling health problems for years, the couple's pastor said.

Police were called the scene of the couple's house on Bay Point Drive around 7.30am. They have not revealed how the Swedish businessman took his life.

'On behalf of the family, Katherine's husband took his own life,' Pastor William Hild told the Sarasota Herald Tribune. 'They are asking for privacy, prayer, thoughts and love from the community.'

Hild added that Ebbeson, a Swedish businessman, 'has been suffering health 
conditions that he'd been attempting to deal with, which had been 
increasingly part of his life'.

Sarasota Police Chief Bernadette DiPino added: 'Mrs. Harris wanted the community, her family and friends to know that her husband is no longer suffering.'

Harris and Ebbeson married in 1996 after meeting on a blind date at the opera, the Sarasota Herald Tribune said. Ebbeson, who had been married once before, became a U.S. citizen in 2000.

Ebbeson had moved from his native Halmstead, Sweden and created InterCon Marketing Inc., an appliances distributor, in Sarasota in 1992. The company has a revenue of up to $25 million a year.

Property: He was found dead at their sprawling property but police did not reveal how he took his life

Public records show his name listed as an officer or owner of 10 other businesses in Florida.

In addition to running his businesses, he also spent his time playing golf, racing cars and cooking, the Herald Tribune reported.

He is survived by his wife, two brothers and a daughter, Louise.

Harris gained national attention while Florida's secretary of state during the state's disputed election recount in 2000 that ultimately made George W. Bush president.

The Republican had certified Bush as the state's winner over Al Gore before the votes were recounted - before halting the recounts and again certifying him the winner.

Her ruling was overturned on appeal by the Florida Supreme Court - before later being reversed in the U.S. Supreme Court. The final decision allowed her previous certification to stand.

She later served in Congress from 2003 to 2007. She retired from public life after losing a senate race against Democrat Bill Nelson in 2006.

Friends told the Herald Tribune that while Ebbeson was rarely seen on the campaign trail, he remained a strong and calming supporter of the politician throughout her career.
