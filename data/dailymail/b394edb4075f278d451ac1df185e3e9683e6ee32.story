A tiny home in south west London that measures just eight and a half feet wide has gone on the market for  £300,000.

Sandwiched between two normal-sized houses, the property in Twickenham still manages to contain a fully equipped kitchen and two beds, though one of them is snuggled up on a mezzanine level above the fridge, and the other is tucked into the sitting room.

Despite its small size, it backs on to a huge garden that has almost five times as much space as the property itself. The house has 322sq ft of living space, compared to the lawn which measures 1,562sq ft. 

Tiny terrace: This skinny property in Twickenham, south west London, measures just eight and a half foot wide with 322sq ft of space

Huge: By contrast the lawn at the back of the house measures 1,562sq ft, making it nearly five times larger than the interior

Narrow: The living room opens out on to this narrow walkway, but through the gate at the end of the path is the property's huge garden

Kitted out: It may not look like it from the outside, but the house has a fully furnished kitchen along with two beds, though on is tucked away on a mezzanine above the fridge, and the other is in the living room

Cosy: The home was originally built as a granny flat and was attached to one of the neighbouring properties, but has since been turned into a home of its own

The garden also contains a shed which measures 17.7ft by 6.5ft, making it significantly wider than the main building.

The skinny property was originally built as a 'granny flat' for the house next door, but is now being sold as one unit. Set back from the main road, It comes with its own driveway and off-street parking.

The previous owner had tried to get permission several years ago to knock down the main home, turn it into a driveway and have the garden turned into a house, but the local authority rejected the application.

Although it's only been on the market for a week, Russell Gooden, who is handling the sale for estate agent Jackson-Stops & Staff has been overwhelmed by interest.

Russell said: 'It's a fantastic property but quite an unusual one to show people round. It's a bit of a marmite house - people either love it or hate it - but I think it will be sold very quickly.

'Though I don't think it's one for two people unless you're very close! I've never seen anything like it - especially because the garden is so large.

'We're certainly enjoying having it on our books.'

Home sweet home: The estate agents have described it as a 'marmite' property, saying viewers either love it or hate it, but in spite of that say they have had plenty of interest

Bedroom: The second bed  (left) is located towards the back of the property in the reception, come living, come sleeping space

Nestled in: One of the bedrooms sits on a mezzanine level above the kitchen with the single bed tucked away in this corner

Single: The house may have two bedrooms, but the estate agents say the house is best suited to one person, unless the couple are very close

Tucked away: This floor plan shows how the miniature property is put together, running in a single line from the kitchen at the front, through to the bathroom and studio bedroom, then out into the huge garden at the back
