Police failed to investigate a rape by Jean Say who went on to kill his own children by cutting their throats as they lay in bed

Rape victims were pressured into withdrawing their allegations to help police meet crime targets, a damning report revealed yesterday.

Detectives from Scotland Yard’s specialist rape unit persuaded the women to say the attacks they endured were ‘consensual sex’.

In one case, a detective sergeant pressured a woman to drop a rape claim against retired security guard Jean Say, 63, who then went on to murder his two children in their beds with a carving knife.

The shocking treatment was revealed in a report by the Independent Police Complaints Commission into the  Southwark branch of Scotland Yard’s Sapphire unit, which investigates rape and sexual assault.

The police watchdog found detectives had adopted an approach of ‘failing to believe’ victims and, in a breach of  the ‘first principle’ of Scotland Yard’s rules, had failed to investigate cases properly.

If they could persuade victims to say the attacks were consensual sex, officers could then write the allegations off as ‘no crime’ incidents to reduce the number of unsolved cases on their  books and meet official crime detection targets.

Deborah Glass, deputy chairman of the IPCC, said the failings were ‘deeply disturbing’, and accused officers of losing sight of their role.

She also warned that the Metropolitan Police’s usual claim of having learnt from earlier failures ‘begins to ring hollow’. She said: ‘The report brings to an end the IPCC’s involvement in this sorry chapter of the Sapphire unit’s history.

‘The approach of failing to believe victims in the first instance was wholly inappropriate.

‘The pressure to meet targets as a 
measure of success, rather than focusing on the outcome for the victim, 
resulted in the police losing sight of what policing is about – 
protecting the public and deterring and detecting crime.’

The IPCC’s report examined the 
practices of the Southwark squad between July 2008 and September 2009. 
It found that the squad was ‘underperforming and overstretched’ during 
that period. It also discovered that victims were closely questioned by a
detective constable before talking to a specialist officer.

Scotland Yard failed to hold gross misconduct proceedings against three officers accused of failings in the investigation into serial sex offender Kirk Reid, it emerged today.

Deborah Glass from the IPCC said it was 'enormously frustrating' that action had not been taken.

The IPCC recommended that a superintendent and two inspectors should face gross misconduct proceedings.

Ms Glass said: 'They need to demonstrate to the people of London that they are taking this seriously and they are holding officers to account.'

She wrote to the Metropolitan Police in June 2010 to complain about 'the unhappy litany of delay and prevarication' in taking action, but received no reply.

The superintendent, who is now a Chief Superintendent, was given 'words of advice', through an internal management procedure.

The detective chief inspector, who is now a superintendent, was given a written warning, as was the detective inspector, who remains at the same rank.

Football coach Reid was found guilty of stalking and preying on 25 women over 12 years in the Balham, Clapham and Tooting areas of south west London.

It emerged during his trial that police did not arrest him until four years after he was first named as a suspect and a separate IPCC inquiry was carried out into apparent blunders and failings.

This meant they were questioned 
repeatedly, going against standard practice which says a victim should 
be believed in the first instance until evidence shows otherwise.

Ms Glass continued: 'The findings of our investigation 
into the rape reported in November 2008 were also deeply disturbing. The
victim was failed by the people from whom she had sought help.

'Since 2009, when the unit came under central command, Sapphire has changed considerably and continues to evolve.

'But given the number of cases where 
the MPS's response to victims has failed, either through individual 
officers’ criminality or neglect or more systemic problems of training, 
priorities and resources, the response that "lessons have been learned" 
begins to ring hollow.

'That is why I asked representatives of those who 
actually deal with victims to advise me of their experience of whether 
lessons have indeed been learned and I am very grateful to those who 
attended a meeting at the IPCC in December 2012 for sharing their 
expertise.

'It is encouraging that this 
experience has, for the most part, improved considerably, though there 
is still more to be done.

'The MPS have recently reconstituted their 
external reference group and it is their responsibility to maintain this
vital link – which if properly used will provide them with an early 
warning system against potential future problems before they become 
headlines. 

'The MPS must now ensure that this 
improvement is built on and continues – and remain vigilant to ensure 
that they do not lose focus on this area as other policing priorities 
emerge, or as they face further pressure on resources.'

The Met’s Sapphire unit is supposed to set the ‘gold standard’ for rape investigations across the country.

But the IPCC report into the latest failings is the ninth investigation into Sapphire and the fifth relating to Southwark.

Nineteen officers from across London have been disciplined, including three who have been sacked.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: ‘We 
have for some time acknowledged that previous investigation of rape and 
serious sexual assault [in the Met] was below standard.

‘The activities identified in this 
report came during that era and highlight specific issues within 
Southwark which resulted in unacceptable actions by local officers.

‘It is as a result of such failings 
that we have made substantial changes to the investigation of rape and 
serious sexual assault.’
