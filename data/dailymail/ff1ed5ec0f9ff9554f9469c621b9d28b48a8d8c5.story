The Maya civilization is well-known for its elaborate temples, sophisticated writing system, and mathematical and astronomical developments - yet the civilization's origins have remained something of a mystery.

However, a newly discovered series of plazas and pyramids have revealed that the civilisation mixed with other early South American cultures more than previously thought.

Archaeologists at the University of Arizona say the find means 'early Maya culture is really more complex than we thought.'

Excavations at Ceibal, an ancient Maya site in Guatemala, suggest that the origins of early Maya civilization are more complex than previously thought

Anthropologists typically fall into one of two competing camps with regard to the origins of Maya civilization.

The first camp believes that it developed almost entirely on its own 
in the jungles of what is now Guatemala and southern Mexico.

The second believes that the Maya civilization developed as the 
result of direct influences from the older Olmec civilization and its 
center of La Venta.

'We're saying that the scenario of early Maya culture is really more 
complex than we thought,' said UA anthropology graduate student Victor 
Castillo, who co-authored the paper in Science.

'We have this idea of the origin of Maya civilization as an indigenous 
development, and we have this other idea that it was an external 
influence that triggered the social complexity of Maya civilization.

'We're now thinking it's not actually black and white,' Castillo said.

In their excavations at Ceibal, an ancient Maya site in Guatemala, 
researchers found that Ceibal actually predates the growth of La Venta 
as a major center by as much as 200 years, suggesting that La Venta 
could not have been the prevailing influence over early Mayan 
development.

That does not make the Maya civilization older than the Olmec 
civilization – since Olmec had another center prior to La Venta – nor 
does it prove that the Maya civilization developed entirely 
independently, researchers say.

What it does indicate, they say, is that both Ceibal and La Venta 
probably participated in a broader cultural shift taking place in the 
period between 1,150-800 B.C.

'Basically, there was a major social change happening from the southern 
Maya lowlands to possibly the coast of Chiapas and the southern Gulf 
Coast, and this site of Ceibal was a part of that broader social 
change,' Inomata said.

'The emergence of a new form of society – with 
new architecture, with new rituals – became really the important basis 
for all later Mesoamerican civilizations.'

The Science paper, titled 'Early Ceremonial Constructions at Ceibal, 
Guatemala, and the Origins of Lowland Maya Civilization,' is based on 
seven years of excavations at Ceibal.
