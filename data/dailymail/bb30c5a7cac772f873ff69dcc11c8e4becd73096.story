Residents in Barcelona fed up with the hordes of tourists crowding their streets have taken their protest against mass tourism to one of the city's most famous landmarks.

Around 300 people organised a noisy demonstration around the Sagrada Familia to complain about the holidaymakers make their lives a misery.

One protester, Abel Maruny, said: 'I'm fed up with being elbowed. I'm not a rude person but at times I run out of patience.'

Hot spot: Gaudi's Sagrada Familia is an imposing sight, which more than three million tourists visit each year

Neighbour Mireia Daniel, 40, added: 'The last few years have been terrible. I can't even take my son to his nursery in a pushchair.'

The number of tourists visiting Barcelona has more than tripled in the last 20 years.

More than three million people visit the Sagrada Familia, a large Roman Catholic church and Unesco World Heritage site designed by Catalan architect Antoni Gaudi, every year.

The protest, which took place on Wednesday, followed demos by residents in another working-class neighbourhood - La Barceloneta - against drunken Magaluf-style holidaymakers and illegal tourist flats.

Months of discontent there erupted after a group of tourists were spotted coming out of a supermarket in the former fishing district naked.

Protestors involved in the Sagrada Familia demo carried banners which said: 'We want a neighbourhood we can live in.' and T-shirts which read: 'I'm not guiri,' a slang term used to describe Anglo-Saxon visitors to Spain.
