The FBI is offering a $30,000 reward for a pair of bank robbers donned the Black Hat Bandits. 

The thieves have been linked to seven hold-ups across Maryland and Virginia in the last two months.

Wearing black hats, sunglasses and fake beards, they have stormed into branches and demanded money from employees.

The pair haven't hurt anyone during the heists, but agents say they are getting more confrontational.

In their most recent attack they held a gun to a teller's head and have jumped over counters in a bid to access bank vaults.  

An FBI statement said: 'In an escalation of violence, the Black Hat Bandits have become more brazen at each robbery having threatened bank customers and tellers, most recently holding a gun to a customer’s head, and jumping teller counters in attempts to gain access to bank vaults. 

'During each robbery, the Black Hat Bandits have been described as carrying handguns and wearing winter coats, sunglasses, black hats (either a winter knit cap or wide brimmed hat) and facial disguises such as ski masks or a fake beard.' 

The bureau have released a plea, urging members of the public with any information to come forward.

It read: 'The FBI Washington and Baltimore Field Offices are investigating these bank robberies with local law enforcement partners in Northern Virginia and Maryland and request that anyone with information call the FBI at 202-278-2000 or 410-265-8080.'

FBI Assistant Agent in Charge Mike McGarrity told WJLA: 'There were guns raised to customers in the bank, as well as tellers. These are guns that are out, they're brandishing them, it doesn't get much more violent than that.

'These are guys that are skilled at what they're doing. These robbers seem proficient with weapons, they've made plans. They're tactical in the way they put customers and employees in the position of coverage.

He added: 'We'll catch them. Statistics show these guys will get caught. We have seven robberies, seven opportunities for witnesses, surveillance video and unique evidence.'
