Gunshots rang out inside a Nevada hospital this afternoon, leaving the gunman dead from a self-inflicted wound and at least three other people injured, one of them fatally. 

The shooting took place at around 2.15pm on the third floor of Renown Regional Medical Center's Center for Advanced Medicine B in Reno.

Reno Police Deputy Chief Tom Robinson said just before 3.40pm local time that two people were dead, including the gunman, and at least two others were being treated for gunshot wounds.

Police have since confirmed that the unnamed shooter turned the gun on himself following the rampage that resulted in the hospital going on lockdown.

Kandy Hall was in the waiting room when she saw a casually dressed, tall white man enter the room with a gun at his side. 

'He pointed it at me and then he brandished it at everyone else that was sitting against the wall and he said something like, "everybody get out of here," or "you’d all better get out of here." Then he opened the door to go back to where the doctor and the nurses were,' she told Reno Gazette-Journal.

Eyewitness Daranda Cone was on her way to a doctor’s appointment at Renown when the shooting happened. 

‘I saw this woman with blood all over her being rushed past me to the ER,’ Cone told Reno Gazette-Journal.

According to local news channels, at least two people, one of them a female doctor, suffered serious injuries and are listed in critical condition. The victims were in surgery Tuesday evening. 

Deputy Chief Robinson told a news conference that no shots were fired by law enforcement officers during the incident, and that the building had been declared 'safe and secure.'

The dead shooter's motives are not immediately known.
