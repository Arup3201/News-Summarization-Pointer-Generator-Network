Spinal Tap star Michael McKean has broken his leg after being hit by a car in New York City.

The 64-year-old, who is currently performing on Broadway, was hurt while walking around Manhattan's Upper West Side.

He was seen lying on a spinal board stretcher with his face bloodied while paramedics treated him.

Mr McKean with his wife actress Annette O'Toole: He is now recovering in hospital

The car which struck him - as well as seeming to knock over a trash can and a mail box on the sidewalk - had a giant hole in its smashed windshield.

The star, who is celebrated as the fictional lead singer David St Hubbins in the spoof heavy metal band movie This Is Spinal Tap, is now recovering in hospital.

His wife, actress Annette O’Toole, was today flying from their home in Los Angeles to be by her husband’s side

Harriet Sternberg, his spokeswoman, said: 'He has sustained multiple injures and we are trying to find out the extent of other injuries. Hopefully, he’ll be fine.'

His condition was today listed as stable.

He was taken by ambulance to St Luke's hospital after being hit at about 3pm yesterday at the intersection of West 86th Street and Broadway.

The three passengers in the vehicle were also taken there after suffering minor injuries.

The actor, who is starring in the Broadway production of Gore Vidal's political drama Best Man, will miss tomorrow night's show.

Miss Sternberg said: 'He’s upset about missing his curtain. He’s never missed a performance in his career.'

It means an understudy will have to stand in for the star for the first time in his 40-year career.

Mr McKean had been playing the role of Dick Jenson since the beginning of April.

The show is due to run three times a week at the Gerard Shoenfield theatre until September 9.

It is unknown whether Mr McKean, who was born in New York City, will be able to continue in the production.

The star is best known for the cult 1984 movie This Is Spinal Tap, which started life on an ABC sketch show in 1979.

When the film aired it became an instant hit in both the U.S. and Britain. Its accompanying soundtrack was also very popular.

Mr McKean joined members of the fictional group reunited in 1992 for a real world tour and have since carried out three more.

He also played Lenny in the hit television comedy show Laverne & Shirley.
