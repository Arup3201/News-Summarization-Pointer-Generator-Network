The Ukip chief suspended over claims he sexually harassed a party candidate today released text messages which he claims proves they were in a relationship.

Natasha Bolter, a key speaker at the party's annual conference, claimed general secretary, Roger Bird, propositioned her over dinner.

But Mr Bird hit back, insisting it was a 'consensual' relationship, during which she sent him messages saying:  'I love u and miss u and think u r sort of perfect'.

Claims: Natasha Bolter, a key speaker at the party's annual conference, claimed general secretary, Roger Bird, propositioned her over dinner

Ukip was plunged into a new sleaze row after Miss Bolter claimed to have been the victim of unwanted advances from Mr Bird.

She told The Times the harassment happened on the day that he interviewed her as a prospective candidate.

After that evening Ms Bolter claims she was sent a string of anonymous 'bullying' emails, accusing her of having sex with Mr Bird and even being pregnant with his child.

Mr Bird today claimed they were 'in a relationship briefly' and has texts and emails to clear his name.

One message, from November 1, allegedly sent by Miss Bolter states: 'I love u and miss u and think u r sort of perfect...'

On November 2 a text said: 'I love u bird and wish u let me look after u. Hope u feel better xx.'

And a message sent on Novermber 9 said: 'I am really missing u bird...'

Miss Bolter denies any romantic or sexual contact.

The row is a major blow for Ukip leader Nigel Farage who has battled to show he has improved the professionalism of his party.

Roger Bird today released details of these text messages sent to him by Miss Bolter to the Telegraph, which he says proves they had a 'consensual' relationship

The 35-year-old, who is of mixed race, yesterday pulled out of hustings in South Basildon, where she was expected to be selected as parliamentary candidate in the winnable seat, which is currently held by the Tories.

Miss Bolter said: 'He asked if we could continue the interview at the Oxford and Cambridge Club that evening.

'I thought it was because I was nervous. [But] when I went I could see that he wasn't really interested in what I had to offer as a politician. 

'He took me down to the snooker room and said, 'I find you very attractive'. He said: 'Would you like to come home with me?'

Ukip suspended Mr Bird last night 'following allegations of impropriety... with regard to candidate selection'.

Neil Hamilton, the former Conservative MP who is now Ukip's deputy chairman, has been parachuted in as a last-minute candidate for South Basildon. 

Mr Bird, 41, today claimed that he had a consensual relationship with Miss Bolter.

He told the BBC: 'We were in a relationship briefly, but that relationship developed well after she had been admitted to the approved candidates list, so her selection was not connected to that.'

He later told The Telegraph: 'I am going to make my case. Everything I am saying is backed by emails and text messages. There are plenty of emails and text messages between us which how it was a consensual relationship with interest on both sides.

'I have done nothing wrong. I am a single man, she is also single, we are both single people who conducted a consensual relationship outside the office.

'I'm very sorry that a story like his should have arisen because it detracts from our [Ukip's] central messages. The party had to respond in a formal way and conduct an appropriate investigation.'

Miss Bolter defected to Ukip from Labour in September – a move that was seen as a huge coup for the party. 

She claimed that Mr Bird continued to try to sleep with her after she told him that she was not interested.

The Times said that in October he invited her for a second time to visit the Oxford and Cambridge Club, where membership is limited to those who attended the two universities.

'He asked me to pop into his office first at 5pm. If the general secretary of the party rings you and says that, you go,' Miss Bolter said. 

Allegations: Ukip general secretary Roger Bird, 41, pictured with Dartford candidate Elizabeth Jones, has been suspended over the claims

She claimed that because she was wearing jeans and was not smart enough to eat at his club, Mr Bird bought her a £169 Ted Baker dress and shoes, telling her she 'now looked like a girl who could get in a taxi'. 

She claimed that at this second meeting, after a heavy meal, Mr Bird 'leant over and tried to kiss me'.

'It was obvious that he wanted to sleep with me,' she said. 'He said, 'I can help you, I'm supporting you'.

'I was quite adamant that I'm not going to sleep with him or anyone [in Ukip]. It's hard enough for women. We shouldn't have to sleep with people to get to the right place.'

Miss Bolter said she left feeling 'very upset' and complained to party officials, who began an investigation that led to Mr Bird's suspension last night.

She also alleged there was a catalogue of racism and sexism in the party and said she was told by another candidate that her only job was 'to look pretty and to get us votes'.

On another occasion a local party chairman allegedly told her that a woman with a young baby was a 'f***ing Pole' who 'hasn't worked out the benefits system and how to get a free pushchair'. Last night, Ukip did not respond to messages from the Daily Mail.

A spokesman told The Times that it would not comment on the allegations. He said the first knowledge the party had that anything was wrong was on November 5.

An internal inquiry was started the next day and Mr Bird was suspended following the submission of a 'draft report' by external consultants on 7 December.

The spokesman said: 'The UK Independence Party took action swiftly and decisively, including steps involving external human resources consultants, as well as following due process and the party's constitution to the letter . . . [Ukip] will not tolerate impropriety of any kind amongst its staff.

'Unfortunately, Ukip has had to suspend Mr Bird pending a full investigation into allegations made against him.'

Mr Bird was a Tory councillor in Wandsworth, South London, before leaving the party in 2009. He joined Ukip the next year. Prior to entering politics he was an auditor.

He has been general secretary of the party since July 2014 and is also the party chairman for the South East of England.

It is understood the allegations do not relate to any potential illegality and police are not involved. Mr Bird declined to comment to The Times.
