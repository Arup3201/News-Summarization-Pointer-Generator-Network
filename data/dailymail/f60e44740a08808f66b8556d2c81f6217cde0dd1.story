Since going public on Thursday, Twitter is valued in the multi-billions. And in less than a week, the social media powerhouse co-founder Jack Dorsey's value on paper soared to more than $865million.

While Twitter's market capitalization, based on its stock price, fell back to around $22.6billion Friday after topping $24billion Thursday, the highly anticipated IPO did not disappoint Twitter bosses, who became multi-millionaires overnight.

But Time Magazine says Twitter's 230million unpaid employees/active users deserve part of the cut.

Their argument being - millions of tweeters are responsible for generating site's content, thereby building Twitter ad revenue and thus are owed for their feeds.

Twitter went public on INovember 7, 2013. Now worth billions, how much does the social media site owe its followers? Millions according to Time Magazine

According to the social media site, active users are responsible for creating 500million Tweets per day. Celebrity tweeters like Katy Perry and Justin Bieber drive mass amounts of people to Twitter everyday.

According to Time, Dorsey and fellow Twitter bosses should feel especially indebted to celebrities like Perry.

The singer recently overtook Bieber as the most followed person on Twitter. The 29-year-old star now has 46,903,486 subscribers to her account - compared to Bieber's 46,737,099.

With 40.5milllion subscribers, Lady Gaga 
is a bit more popular on Twitter than President Barack Obama who is 
followed by 39.5million.

Justin Bieber's nonstop tweets are followed by 46,737,099 people. According to an equation devised by Time Magazine, the singer is owed a whopping $20,916,384.

Time came up with a 
equation to determine just how much of the cut people like top tweeters, Perry,  Bieber
and the President deserve. It's based on number of followers and tweets per day.

According to Time's formula, Bieber, a nonstop tweeter, is due a 
whopping $20,916,384 while President Obama is owed just over $5million. 
Kim Kardashian, Rhianna, Ashton Kutcher and Perry are each owed several 
million for their devotion to the site.

Katy Perry recently overtook Justin Bieber as the most followed person on Twitter. The 29-year-old star now has 46,903,486 subscribers. According to Time Magazine's equation, Twitter owes her over $4million

By dividing a person's tweets by the number of days they have had a Twitter account and then multiplying that amount by the number of followers, Time has determined how many potential eyeballs per day a Tweeter generates.

That number is then multiplied by 25 per cent. (The magazine cited a study that 'suggests that around three-quarters of tweets are ignored. To estimate a user’s current number of daily readers, (Time) reduce the potential audience by 75%.')

If Twitter were to start spreading the wealth among its top users, Lady Gaga, who has the third largest following, would have received $2,266,753, while Taylor Swift, who was ranked the fifth most popular tweeter, would have received $1,249,976.

Justin Timberlake, ranked No. 10 on the tracking site Twitterholics, would have walked away with $1,055,074.

In an interesting twist, having a higher number of followers than someone else does not automatically mean a bigger potential pay-out.

For example, Miss Swift has about 20million more followers that Ashton Kutcher, but because he fires off more messages per day than her, he has nearly 30million more potential eyeballs per day, thus making him (in theory) $2,178,695 richer.

US President Barack Obama has 39.5million followers. According to Time Magazine, Twitter owes him just over $5million

To determine the amount each eyeball is worth per day, the magazine took Twitter's $24.9billion value and divided it by the companies' estimated 200billion per day tweet delivery service, which equals 12.45 cents. 

It is important to point out that those 
figures are based solely on Time Magazine's equation, and that the value
of the social media giant reflects not its current user base, but 
rather its potential to grow.

Time makes it easy to determine how much any Twitter member is worth by simply popping in a username to their site.
