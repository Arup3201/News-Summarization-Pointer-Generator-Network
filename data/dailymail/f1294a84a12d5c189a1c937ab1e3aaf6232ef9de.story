It would be difficult to argue that Louis van Gaal has got the most out of his Manchester United squad after spending £150million on new players last summer.

West Ham boss Sam Allardyce criticised United's long-ball style following Sunday's 1-1 draw at Upton Park, a game in which Daley Blind rescued a point for the visitors in added time.

United have looked unbalanced at times this season, while Van Gaal's decision to drop Wayne Rooney into midfield as Robin van Persie and Radamel Falcao struggle continues to confuse.

So with United coming under pressure to find the right formula, Sportsmail's experts have picked the starting XIs they believe would be most effective, regardless of injuries or suspensions.

Ian Ladyman

(4-3-2-1) De Gea; Rafael, Evans, Rojo, Shaw; Herrera, Carrick, Blind; Di Maria, Rooney; Van Persie

The back four here contains the squad's two natural full-backs and its two best nuts and bolts central defenders. 

Herrera needs a chance in midfield and his selection allows Rooney to be pushed further up the field. Van Persie is on borrowed time but remains United's best finisher.

Neil Ashton

(4-3-2-1) De Gea; Jones, Evans, Rojo, Shaw; Blind, Carrick; Mata, Di Maria, Valencia; Rooney

Van Gaal will spend 90 minutes with his hands over his eyes whatever defence he picks, but at least Rojo looks increasingly solid.

Blind looks decent in the centre and Carrick can keep things ticking over alongside him in the engine room.

This team relies on the attacking value sand principles of the club, turning to wingers - Mata and Valencia - and create from both sides. Then it's up to Rooney to score the goals.

Van Persie and Falcao can wait for it all to go wrong on the bench before Van Gaal throws them on in desperation.

Chris Wheeler

(4-2-3-1) De Gea; Valencia, Jones, Rojo, Shaw; Carrick, Blind; Mata, Rooney, Di Maria; Van Persie.

A flat back-four (ideally with a new right-sided centre-back sooner rather than later), Rooney in a more advanced role, the right pegs in the right holes.

Dominic King

(4-2-3-1) De Gea; Rafael, Evans, Rojo, Shaw; Carrick, Blind; Di Maria, Fellaini, Mata; Rooney

First of all Wayne Rooney needs to play in his best position as a central striker, given that Falcao and van Persie are in wretched form. 

Fellaini's height and physical strength would be effective against Burnley's direct probing, not to mention being useful at the other end of the pitch. 

Juan Mata is an excellent player and deserves a chance ahead of Ander Herrera.

Matt Barlow

(4-4-2) De Gea; Rafael, Jones, Rojo, Shaw; Januzaj, Carrick, Blind, Di Maria;Rooney, Van Persie

It's flawed but it's balanced and in a straightforward system that everyone should understand. 

There's pace out wide, control in the centre and two goal scorers up front with the intelligence to react if an extra body is required in midfield. 

Ideally, it would be stronger at the back and there fouls be more energy in the centre but the squad is off kilter.

Sami Mokbel

(4-3-1-2) De Gea; Rafael, Evans, Rojo, Shaw; Carrick, Blind, Rooney; Di Maria; Van Persie, Falcao

I desperately tried to fit Di Maria, Rooney, Falcao and Van Persie into the team - and I think I've managed it. 

I've slotted Rooney into midfield - but with the license to push forward when United are in possession. 

The balance of this side is probably all wrong, it would concede goals. But they'd score a few, too.
