Tourists are finding themselves in a sticky situation in Seattle, where they have covered a wall entirely in used bubble gum.

The colourful work of art – which some passers-by may find revolting – was created by thousands of holidaymakers in an alley near one of the oldest farmers’ markets in the US.

David Fulmer, 37, from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, took these pictures of the gum wall while on holiday with his girlfriend in the Pacific coast city.

The brick wall is decorated with thousands of pieces of colourful bubble gum, stuck on by tourists who have passed the wall over the years.

It is believed the first pieces of gum were stuck to the wall around 20 years ago, and the so-called ‘bubble gum alley’ eventually became a tourist attraction as visitors added to it.

The sticky attraction was once named one of the ‘germiest’ tourist attractions in the world by TripAdvisor, with some layers several inches thick or as tall as 15ft.

David was hoping to visit three National Parks as part of his trip but took a pit stop in Seattle to explore the Pike Place Market.

It was under the market that he discovered the alley where the Gum Wall can be admired, adorned in chewed gum from thousands of different mouths.

David said: ‘I was a little bit shocked when I first saw the gum wall but after looking at it closely and seeing the thousands of different bits of gum, it makes a really great visual impression.

‘It's a cool and unique thing to discover and as a tourist you don't see something like this every day.’
