Joran Van der Sloot is currently behind bars in a Peruvian prison, but rumours abound that he could be tying the knot whilst incarcerated.

A tabloids in the country is reporting that the convicted killer of 21-year-old Stephany Flores is planning to marry a mystery woman within the walls of the Lima, Peru prison.

The Dutchman’s lawyer, Maximo Altez, denied the tabloid rumours, but added: ‘I’m just in charge of his legal issues, and I don’t participate in his private life.’

Tying the knot? Dutch citizen Joran Van der Sloot, pictured in January, is rumoured to be getting married whilst in prison in Peru

Speaking out: Van der Sloot says in newly-revealed jailhouse letters that he hopes the Flores family can forgive him and blames 'bad legal advice' for his lengthy sentence

Convicted: Van der Sloot was sentenced to 28 years in prison in the murder of Stephany Flores

Van der Sloot is currently serving a 28-year sentence after pleading guilty to Flores’ 2010 death at the maximum security facility Piedras Gordas in Lima, Peru.

The business student was found 
strangled in Van der Sloot’s hotel room. The 24-year-old prisoner is 
also the primary suspect in the 2005 disappearance of Natalee Holloway. 
She vanished in Aruba while on break with her school friends.

Mr Altez told the Daily Beast that the
Peruvian newspaper cited him as their source on the matter, but said: 
‘I deny all of that.’

Van der Sloot is also trying to appeal what he calls a lengthy sentenc

In the letters, believed to have been written last month and released by his lawyer Max Altez, van der Sloot says that he hopes the Flores family can forgive him for his crimes.

'I ask God every day that Stephany's parents can find it in their heart to forgive me,' van der Sloot wrote.

But van der Sloot also made an attempt to paint himself as the victim.

He
said that he believes he was misled by his attorney when he pleaded 
guilty to Flores’ murder and suffers from ‘psychological’ problems that 
he believes should have been weighed in the murder case.

Van
der Sloot wrote: 'My rights have been constantly abused. My lawyer promised me I would receive 15 years if I plead guilty, I did.'

He
also referred to himself as a psychological 'mess' in the letters, 
which were written in English and contain numerous misspellings and 
grammatical errors.

'I have a history of psychological problems which were never taken into consideration,' he said.Van
der Sloot also took the opportunity to address Natalee Holloway, 
claiming once again that he had nothing to do with the teen’s 2005 
disappearance in Aruba.

He 
also faces charges of trying to extort $25,000 from Natalee Holloway’s 
mother Beth, promising to reveal the location of the 17-year-old’s body 
in exchange for the money.

His extradition to the U.S. has been approved in that case, but he must first serve his sentence in Peru for the Flores murder.

Last
month, a Peruvian court ruled that van der Sloot will be extradited to 
the U.S. to face trial in an alleged extortion plot against Holloway's 
mother Beth.

That trial, however, won't happen until he has served his 28-year jail sentence in Peru for the murder of Stephany Flores.

The
decision by the Peruvian Supreme Court means that the family of 
Holloway, who disappeared in 2005 and has since been declared dead, will
have to wait many more agonising years before they will see van der 
Sloot on trial.

Natalee Holloway was 17 when she disappeared in Aruba, a Dutch island in the southern Caribbean Sea, during a school trip.

Prosecutors said $25,000 was paid to van der Sloot, but nothing was disclosed about Natalee's whereabouts.

Altez had recently speculated he thought his client would be extradited within three months, and had believed the U.S. trial would go ahead before the Peruvian murder sentence.

Authorities in the U.S. believe that 
the money extorted from Beth Holloway was used by van der Sloot to 
travel to Peru on May 14, 2010, 
a trip that ended with the murder of Flores, whom he met in
a Lima casino, on May 25.

The date is a chilling one to the Holloway family, as it was five years to the day after the 18-year-old was last seen.

He
took cash and credit cards from Miss Flores before fleeing to Chile, 
where he was caught two days after her decaying body was found.

He
confessed to the 'cruel' murder, telling police he became enraged after
she found out about his suspected involvement in the Natalee Holloway 
case.

Before and after: Van der Sloot is seen left in a mugshot from 2010 and right at in a Peru court on in January

Holloway's body has never been found 
and repeated searches turned up nothing as intense media coverage 
brought the case worldwide attention.

Investigators
have long worked from the assumption that the young woman was dead in 
Aruba, where the case was classified as a homicide investigation.

That
investigation remains open, though there has been no recent activity, 
according to Solicitor General Taco Stein, an official with the 
prosecutor's office in Aruba.
