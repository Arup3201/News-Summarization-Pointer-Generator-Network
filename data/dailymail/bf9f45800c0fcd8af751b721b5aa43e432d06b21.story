Hearts midfielder Jamie Walker and Hibs defender Lewis Stevenson have both accepted two-match bans for their part in the stormy end to Sunday’s Edinburgh derby.

As the clock ran down in a 2-1 win for Hearts at Tynecastle, Easter Road midfielder Stevenson’s nasty tackle provoked an irate response from Walker who went for his opponent and deliberately clashed heads.

Neither Stevenson nor Walker were punished by referee Willie Collum for the flare-up that happened in the dying embers of an ill-tempered game that also saw Hibs midfielder Scott Robertson and Hearts attacker Osman Sow red-carded.

After reviewing the footage of the late flashpoint, however, new Scottish FA compliance officer Tony McGlennan took retrospective action on Tuesday by issuing a fast-track notice of complaint against the duo – offering each an immediate two-game suspension.

Stevenson was charged with a breach of disciplinary rule 200, exhibiting ‘serious foul play by stamping or attempting to stamp on an opposing player, namely Jamie Walker’.

Walker, for his retaliation, was charged with breaching the same disciplinary rule 200 by exhibiting ‘violent conduct by headbutting or attempting to head-butt an opposing player, namely Lewis Stevenson’.

Hearts quickly announced that Walker would not be contesting the ban, with a spokesman saying: ‘Heart of Midlothian has today received a notice of complaint from the SFA against Jamie Walker for an incident that took place in Sunday’s derby win over Hibs. The club has accepted the offer of a two-game ban and will not be appealing.’

The 21-year-old Tynecastle midfielder will now miss Wednesday night’s Petrofac Training Cup tie at Livingston then sits out of Saturday’s top-of-the-table Championship clash with Raith Rovers at Stark’s Park.

Hibs duly followed suit in refusing to contest the charge and the 26-year-old long-serving Easter Road player will now sit out of his side’s home Championship match with Falkirk on Saturday and then a Scottish League Cup tie against Dumbarton in Edinburgh on Tuesday.
