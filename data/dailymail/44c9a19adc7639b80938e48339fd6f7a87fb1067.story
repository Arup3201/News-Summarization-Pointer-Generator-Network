Aston Villa never recovered after an early brace from Groningen attacker Tjarron Chery put the hosts 2-0 up inside seven minutes in their pre-season friendly at Euroborg, with the Dutch side going on to win 4-1.

Paul Lambert's side, fresh from a 3-1 defeat at the hands of Chesterfield on July 30, put in a disappointing performance against their Eredivisie opponents, as they created very little going forward and rarely threatened the Groningen goal.

Jarchinio Antonia and Dino Islamovic scored the home side's third and fourth goals, either side of a thumping Charles N'Zogbia free-kick in the 76th minute. 

Rout: Tjarron Chery is congratulated by his Groningen team-mates after scoring his first goal of the game

Despair: Villa goalkeeper Shay Given shouts his frustrations after his error led to Chery's first strike

Midfield battle: Fabian Delph dribbles past Danny Hoesen, who grabbed an assist for Groningen's third goal

Deep in thought: Villa boss Paul Lambert looks on as his side are comprehensively beaten by their Dutch hosts

Groningen: Padt, Kappelhof, Kieftenbeld, Hoesen, Chery, Antonia, van Nieff, Lindgren, van der Velden, Hiariej, Magnasco. 

Goals: Chery (2), Antonia, Islamovic.

Aston Villa: Given, Hutton (Herd 71), Senderos (Okore 65), Baker (Stevens 71), Clark (Gardner 71), Westwood (Grealish 71), Delph (El Ahmadi 65), Weimann (N'Zogbia 65), Richardson, Agbonlahor, Bent (Bacuna 65). 

Subs not used: Guzan.

Goal: N'Zogbia.

Chery gave Groningen the lead in the fourth minute after an uncharacteristic goalkeeping error from Shay Given. The former Newcastle shot-stopper's poor clearance fell straight to Chery and he made no mistake with his finish.

Three minutes later Groningen's N0 10 doubled his side's advantage with a thunderbolt into the top corner from 30 yards. Given, on this occasion, could do nothing about the goal. 

The hosts continued to dominate proceedings at Euroborg, and shortly after the half-hour mark, Antonio tapping in from a close-range after a driving run down the wing from Danny Hoesen. 

Three down at the break, Lambert resisted making changes until midway through the second half. 

Instructions: Lambert's assistant Roy Keane urges his team on during a brief water break at Euroborg

Digesting: Keane doesn't look best pleased during Villa's defeat, while Delph, right, did his best to push on

Here to stay: Villa defender Ron Vlaar, who has been linked with a move away, watched on from the bench

Charles N'Zogbia was one of those introduced, and the Frenchman soon left his stamp on the game with an emphatic free-kick in the 76th minute. Leandro Bacuna, another of Villa's second-half substitutes, was given a standing ovation by the Groningen fans having played for them for four years between 2009-2013.

Despite Nzogbia's thunderous set piece, Villa continued to look short of ideas going forward, and the Frenchman was at fault for Groningen's fourth and final goal in added time at the end of the game, as he gave away possession cheaply, allowing Islamovic to sneak in and slot the ball under Given.
