Roberto Martinez thinks Gerard Deulofeu can break into the Barcelona first team, but the Everton manager admits the forward may find it tricky competing against the likes of Lionel Messi, Neymar, Pedro and Alexis Sanchez for a place.

Deulofeu, a regular in the Everton team, thrust himself on to the radar of Barcelona coach Luis Enrique after helping Martinez's side finish fifth, leading him to recall the 20-year-old to the Nou Camp.

But Martinez feels another year in the Premier League would have benefited Deulofeu more, rather than returning to the La Liga giants, where he will be constantly competing for a place.

It will, undoubtedly, prove a difficult task, given Barcelona's prowess in attack.

Nevertheless, it is a challenge Martinez feels Deulofeu is up to.

'He is ready to play for Barcelona because he has special talent, certain qualities that make him stand out,' Martinez said in an interview with Spanish national daily sport newspaper Mundo Deportivo.

'I was delighted when Del Bosque called him up for the friendly before the World Cup.

'They had followed him for the year he was at Everton and were able to see that he was performing to a very high level.

'It would have been good for Gerard and for Everton if he had stayed for us for another year. He would have enjoyed a bigger role in the team than I think he will have at Barcelona because of the competition he will find there.

Boss: Roberto Martinez says Deulofeu has a 'special talent' but wished he could have kept him for another year

'It would have been fantastic to have him at Everton for another year, and another year in the Premier League would have made him better prepared to make the jump up to Barcelona, but they didn't want that, and I presume that's because Luis Enrique, who knows him well, knows how good he is.'

Martinez, unfortunately, looks to be without another of his loan stars next season, as striker Romelu Lukaku returns to parent club Chelsea after scoring 15 goals with Everton.

It is believed, however, the Belgium international could follow Deulofeu to Spain with Atletico Madrid among those chasing the striker, should the La Liga champions lose Diego Costa to Chelsea.

'Romelu is a bit like Gerard, a great player but a youngster, he arrived in Liverpool without much tactical discipline, but he has improved a lot, without losing any of his physical or technical assets,' said Martinez.

'If he ends up going to Atletico, knowing the work of (Atletico coach) Diego Simeone, it will be good for Simeone and for Atletico. I also think his characteristics will suit Simeone, and vice-versa.'
