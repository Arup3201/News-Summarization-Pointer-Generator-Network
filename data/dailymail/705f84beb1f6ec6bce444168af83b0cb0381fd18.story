In her role as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton raised possibility of giving Israel a green light to attack, it has been claimed

Hillary Clinton raised the possibility of giving Israel a green light to attack Iran when she was secretary of state, it has been claimed.

She made the suggestion in 2010 when the U.S. were concerned that Israel might launch a unilateral air strike against Iran’s nuclear program, according to US sources.

As officials discussed ways to dissuade the Israeli Prime Minister from taking unilateral action, it is claimed that Mrs Clinton then floated the idea that giving the green light for such a move could 'take care of the problem for' the US, one senior administration official quoted her saying reported Time.

The report says that Mrs Clinton did not actually endorse the idea.

It states she only raised the notion 'as one option to consider' according to one former official, who added that it was not considered inside the administration.

Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates writes in his new memoir, Duty that at a January 2010 Oval Office meeting, he told Mr Obama 'he needed to consider the ramifications of a no-warning Israeli attack,” including whether the U.S. would assist Israel and how it would respond to Iranian retaliation.'

Earlier this week Iranian President Hassan Rouhani boasted to a cheering crowd that the United States and other world powers 'surrendered' to Tehran with the new nuclear agreement struck in Geneva.

'Do you know what the Geneva agreement means? It means the surrender of great international powers before the great nation of Iran,' the moderate leader told a home crowd.

Yesterday the White House released a summary of the deal reached between six major world powers and Iran to curb its nuclear program, responding to calls from the U.S. Congress and other groups for more transparency about what the agreement entails.

Iran has denied it wants to use the program to eventually build nuclear weapons but agreed to scale it back after the international community applied strict financial and oil sanctions.

The six-month preliminary deal includes some relief from the sanctions as talks continue toward a broader, long-term deal.

The White House gave Congress access to the full text of technical instructions for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) but released a detailed four-page summary of the deal to the public.

'It is the preference of the IAEA 
that certain technical aspects of the technical understandings remain 
confidential,' White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters.

Wendy Sherman, the State Department's lead Iran negotiator, briefed lawmakers on the agreement on Thursday.

Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates has been forced to wear a neck brace while on his book launch after breaking his first vertebrae after a fall.

Mr Gates, former Central Intelligence Agency director for President George H.W. Bush and President Obama, fractured his neck after slipping on ice outside his home in Seattle at the beginning of the year.

In 2008, Mr Gates broke his shoulder after slipping on ice, causing him to miss a congressional hearing.

Some
 walked out of the meeting saying it had heightened, rather than eased, 
their concerns about negotiations between Iran and the United States and
 five other world powers.

'I'm more disturbed more than ever after the briefing,' Republican South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham said.

Mr Graham, a frequent critic of the Obama administration's foreign policy initiatives, is a co-sponsor of a bill opposed by the White House to slap new sanctions on Iran if it walks away from the negotiations.

Iran agreed to stop production of 20 percent enriched uranium on or by Monday, Jan. 20, and to begin diluting half of its stockpile of 20 percent enriched uranium.

Over the next six months, the IAEA will verify a series of other curbs on enrichment and use of centrifuges.

Iran is not allowed to commission or fuel the Arak reactor, and must stop producing and testing fuel for the reactor, the summary said.

At the end of the six-month period, Iran will agree to 'a cap on the permitted size of Iran's up to 5 percent enriched uranium stockpile,' the summary said.

IAEA inspectors will visit the Natanz and Fordow uranium enrichment sites daily, including both scheduled and unannounced inspections.

Inspectors will visit the Arak reactor at least monthly, up from the current pace of one every three months, or longer.

Iran agreed to provide design information for the Arak reactor and other access to related facilities, the summary said.

The added inspections will 'enable the international community to more quickly detect breakout or the diversion of materials to a secret program,' the summary said.

The European Union, Iran, and the six major powers (P5+1) that are part of the agreement will name a joint commission of experts to work with the IAEA to implement the deal and discuss any issues that arise. The group will meet once a month.
