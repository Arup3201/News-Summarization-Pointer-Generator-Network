This is the moment veteran television presenter Sir Tony Robinson was blown up by a 'bomb' as part of his new television series on the First World War.

Although no stranger to a muddy ditch - thanks to his years presenting Time Team - to ensure Sir Tony had a realistic experience of what life in the trenches would have been like producers on the show decided to set off explosives  as he stood in a replica trench system in Suffolk.

The 68-year-old actor said even though it was not a real bomb, the experience was still terrifying.

He said: 'They let off a load of explosives to try and recapture for me what it would have been like.

'You just got blasted to pieces by this stuff,' he said. 'All I got was peat, can you imagine if it was rocks, human body parts and bits of petrol can?' 

Sir Tony is best known for his role as bullied dogsbody Baldrick in the classic comedy series Blackadder. 

He says he has a huge interest in the war as his grandfather fought but, like many of his generation, never spoke about his experiences - to the extent that Sir Tony does not even know the name of his grandfather’s battalion. 

Tony Robinson's World War One is a new four-part television series which tells the story of the Great War - how it started, what happened and how it changed the world.

Sir Tony (pictured left and right as Baldrick with Rowan Atkinson in Blackadder) says he is very interested in the war as his grandfather fought on the front line - but never spoke about his experiences 

The programme will see Sir Tony visit the Memorial to the Missing in Ypres, fly a 100-year-old Bristol fighter plane and drive one of the first tanks.

Sir Tony, who was knighted last year by the Duke of Cambridge, said filming the show gave him a little more insight into the horrific experiences of his grandfather, Private John Robinson, who fought on the front line.

Sir Tony said: 'I don't know why he didn't talk about it but I can see why the unremitting horror might have been a reason why you want to blank it out.' 

Following his return from the war, his wife immediately set fire to his uniform and he never spoke of it again. 

Sir Tony says that while he knows his grandfather fought on the front line in 1917 and 1918, he will never know what exactly he experienced. 

With the aid of hundreds of archived 3D images, the programme will chronicle the war from start to finish and  aims to allow modern audiences to see the war in a completely new way.

The images were taken 100 years ago, when three dimensional photography was extremely popular.

This 3D picture shows soldiers in the German Army lining up - it was taken sometime before 1914

The pictures were then viewed through specialist equipment known as a stereoscope.

A Discovery Channel spokesman said: 'Sir Tony will also show how the Great War changed British people for generations to come - liberating large portions of the working class, powering the rise of the Labour party and breaking the old ties of service to the aristocracy.'

The series was shot on location in Britain, France, Belgium and Germany, visiting many of the famous landmarks and battlefields from the war. 

The series will begin on Sunday at 8pm on the Discovery Channel, with Sir Tony visiting a Berlin Kaiserpanorama show, where he will explain the stereoscope 3D process and uses it to show Europe in 3D before the war.
