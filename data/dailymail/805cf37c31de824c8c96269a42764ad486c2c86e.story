The seven-year-old boy who wowed America starring as a mini Darth Vader in a popular Super Bowl commercial says he feels great after undergoing successful open-heart surgery.

Max Page was released from
Children's Hospital Los Angeles last Monday, four 
days after his pulmonary valve was replaced in a two-hour operation. He headed home with his parents and younger brother.

Max,  who plays Reed on the CBS soap 
opera The Young and the Restless, was born with a congenital heart defect and has undergone eight surgical procedures.

Progress: Max rallied quickly after this month's operation, giving a thumbs-up the next day and telling his parents, 'I am happy' the day after that, said his mother, Jennifer Page

He rallied quickly 
after this month's operation, giving a thumbs-up the next day and telling
his parents, 'I am happy' the day after that, said his mother, Jennifer
Page.

In an interview with TODAY, Max told how he felt great and was looking forward to returning to acting. 'You'll see me in August, folks,' the brave boy said.

The valve used for Max will last about 15 years and won't require invasive surgery to replace it, according to the hospital.

But Max faces six to eight weeks of recovery. 'I don't think I can run around, That's the problem,' he said. I want to run around so bad, but I just can't.'

The Force: Page shot to fame in 'The Force' Volkswagen commercial, which was one of the most talked about ads of 2011's Super Bowl. In the ad, he fails to move the family's dog, the washing machine and his sister's doll using his powers

Jennifer Page, his mother, said the family were realise how lucky they are. 'We're parents that are taking their child home,' she said. 'That's a huge blessing and we don't take a single second for granted.'

She added that there's been an outpouring of support and kindness and that Max and the 
family welcome all 'prayers and encouragement.'

He was in good spirits the night before the operation, making everyone 
laugh, his father, Buck Page, said in a family statement.

'Max wanted to hold his brother's hand, and Max said to Els, "It's OK, I'm not scared."

'He just wanted to hold our hands and his stuffed animals. He was much calmer than we were,' Jennifer Page said.

Earlier this week, Max said he had steeled himself for the operation when he spoke at a press conference.

'I kind of know I have to go through 
it, and don't have an option, so I choose a good attitude,' said Max, 
who serves as a junior ambassador for the hospital.

'I'll feel weak after this, but it will get better and better. I think I know it will be a good thing to go through this.'

The boy's mother, Jennifer Page, told reporters on Wednesday 13 June that Max was informed on June 10 he would need the surgery.

'He took the time to cry and be scared, and jumped on board with a positive attitude,' she said.

Little Max, who carried a stuffed whale, shared with reporters some 'Star Wars' wisdom ahead of his surgery.

'The Force can really achieve anything,' said Max.

Positive: Max Page was positive ahead of his open-heart surgery which took place on Thursday 14 June

The boy's heart valve has 
deteriorated, said Dr. Vaughn Starnes, the cardiothoracic surgeon at the
hospital who will perform the procedure.

That
is creating a problem for the heart to empty out into the pulmonary 
arteries, which is why the operation is set to give Max a new valve.

According
to an email from Max’s mother, Jennifer, the young actor started crying
when he first learned about his upcoming operation.

The email, released through the ad 
agency that conceived the successful advert, revealed that the 
seven-year-old was most scared of ‘blood draws, spending the night in 
the hospital and hurting.’

However,
the cherubic looking boy soon put on a brave face reportedly telling 
his mother: ‘I have to go through it. I don’t like it and it’s still 
scary — but I have to. So I think I might as well go through it with a 
good attitude.’

As an ambassador for the Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, Max raises money for other children with heart defects.

In the advert, he finally has success when he switches on his dad's Volkswagen using the 'force'

Page was first diagnosed with the 
heart defect when he was a few months old and was later fitted with a 
pacemaker, which keeps his heart beating at a regular rate.

The 2011 Volkswagen commercial was one of the most lauded of last year’s Super Bowl.

The ad shows the young boy – dressed in a full Darth Vader outfit -  attempt to use the Force around the house.

He cannot move the family dog and nothing happens when he tries using it against a washing machine, or his sister’s doll.

But when he uses the Force against his dad’s Volkswagen – the engine roars into action.

The
advertisement quickly gained a mass following on social media and Max 
made appearances on national network television shows such as The Today 
Show.

Children with Tetralogy of Fallot, the condition Max suffers from, can enjoy a largely normal life after surgery, said Dr. Ralph Mosca, professor in the department of cardiothoracic surgery and pediatrics at New York University.

'The fact this kid had seven (previous) surgeries - he may be one of the more complex forms,' said Mosca, who has never treated Max.
