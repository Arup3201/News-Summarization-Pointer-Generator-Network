Cherie Blair declared the bride the most beautiful she had ever seen. The groom, her son Euan, looked similarly ‘amazing’. And filled with ‘breathtaking’ flowers, the church in the quiet Buckinghamshire village of Wotton Underwood was a worthy backdrop.

In fact, the wedding of the Blairs’ first-born Euan was pretty near  perfect. Even the rain held off.

But one dark cloud hovered over the big day in the form of TV weathergirl Sian Lloyd, the stepmother of the bride, Suzanne Ashman.

The Mail on Sunday can reveal that Miss Lloyd has admitted being ‘flabbergasted’ at the decision to  ban her from the ceremony.

Having
 been invited some months ago, she discovered last week she was no 
longer welcome and was met with a ‘wall of silence’ when she sought an 
explanation.

He is said to be keen to follow his father Tony’s footsteps into Parliament. But Euan Blair showed that when it comes to preparing for his wedding, he is also keen on the pampering that appeals to his mother, Cherie.

The ex-Prime Minister’s son was seen having an executive footcare treatment at Champneys spa in Tring, Hertfordshire, last Thursday. Cherie and his sister, Kathryn, enjoyed luxury manicures alongside him. They were accompanied by a blonde, believed to be a bridesmaid.

Dressed in a white robe, Euan sat next to Cherie, also in a white robe. His treatment lasted 25 minutes, cost £35 and involved cutting and filing nails, removing skin and massaging the feet.

Euan was laughing and chatting to Cherie as he relaxed in the nail salon, which appeared to have been reserved for them. One guest said: ‘I couldn’t believe it when I saw Cherie and her party.

‘They were relaxed and seemed to have come from the house, where the luxury bedrooms are.’ It is also believed Euan had a facial and a body massage to make him picture-perfect for his nuptials. It is thought he opted for the men’s grooming package – which costs £85 and lasts for one hour and 25 minutes.

The party of four are believed to have stayed in four premiere rooms attached to the original house. A two-night break in a premiere room costs £647 per room.

‘She is puzzled
 at the reason behind such rudeness,’ a close friend told The Mail on 
Sunday yesterday. ‘She is flabbergasted at the “disinvite”.’

Friends
 said Miss Lloyd, 55, has made no secret of her staunch opposition to 
the war in Iraq and has been strongly critical of Mr Blair’s 
‘warmongering words about Syria’.

This, she feels, might lie behind the snub, even if only in part.

While her comments were never delivered publicly, it is thought they may have reached the former Prime Minister’s ears.

There
 was some speculation that Miss Lloyd would attend the ceremony with 
husband Jonathan Ashman, regardless of being ‘uninvited’ – but she 
insisted that was never the case.

‘No,
 no reinvite has followed the disinvite,’ she told a friend in an email.
 ‘Original invite on table  here, with Sian & Jonathan writ large on
 envelope . . . but alas, alack & woe is me.’

In
 another message on Friday, she said: ‘Designer dress and posh high 
heels returned to wardrobe with a sigh . . . back to weather charts to 
try and deliver a sunny day for tomorrow’s newlyweds.’

After
 lunching with girlfriends yesterday – and raising ‘a glass of bubbly to
 the happy couple’ – Miss Lloyd was planning to ‘curl up on the sofa and
 watch a film’.

Some in Miss
 Lloyd’s circle say her fractious relationship with the first wife of 
her husband is probably a more credible explanation for  her exclusion.

‘Sian says it might be due to the ex-wife resenting how happy she is with Jonathan,’ said another source close to Miss Lloyd.

At
 first, Mr Ashman, a 64-year-old motor-racing entrepreneur, was so 
incensed at his wife’s treatment that he threatened to boycott the 
wedding. However, Miss Lloyd convinced him to change his mind and give 
his daughter away.

‘Sian 
said she was pleased she  persuaded him to attend as it was the right 
thing to do. She said Jonathan absolutely hated the idea of going 
without her,’ said a friend.

Yesterday at All Saints, Wotton Underwood, ten minutes’ walk from the Blairs’ mansion, all rancour  was forgotten.

As
 he watched his 25-year-old daughter, in an oyster cream dress, step 
from a chauffeur-driven black taxi, Mr Ashman announced: ‘I am very 
proud.’

And after praising 
the bride,  Cherie Blair said of her 29-year-old son, who wore a blue 
lounge suit with a white carnation: ‘Didn’t my boy look amazing!’ 
Earlier, at the church door, an emotional Mr Blair held his son’s face 
in his hands and kissed him on the cheek.

Mr Blair said later: ‘It is a very happy day. We are grateful to have such a wonderful daughter-in-law.’

At
 the wedding, meanwhile, guests danced the night away in a marquee 
squeezed between two tall hedges, a short stroll through ornamental 
gardens from the main house.

In a romantic detail, either side of the marquee’s entrance was decorated with two entwined hearts.

The
 Blairs bought 17th-century South Pavilion, worth £5.75 million, in 
2008. Once home to the actor  Sir John Gielgud, it has seven bedrooms 
and grounds that include a former farmhouse now used by security staff.

Sources
 recalled yesterday how Miss Lloyd’s relationship with her husband’s 
Turkish-born first wife, Sedef, was ‘difficult from day one’.

Doting father: Jonathan Ashman looks tearful at his glowing daughter as she gets ready to go. There is no sight or mention of his new wife Sian Lloyd, who was banned from attending

‘She
 [Sian] always felt like she was seen as a bit cheap and on the make,’ 
said a friend. ‘Sian tried to make an effort with Suzanne but because of
 her mother she wouldn’t give an inch. They both looked down on her and 
she gained the impression that they thought she was a bit of an 
embarrassment.

‘There was 
slow-burning animosity, then they had a heated conversation on the phone
 about two months ago when Sian asked straight out why she [Sedef] had a
 problem with her. It never recovered from there.’

Yesterday,
 Sedef, the daughter of the former mayor of the Turkish capital, Ankara,
 cut a striking figure in a short blue dress. Her marriage to Mr Ashman 
ended 13 years ago and she arrived at the wedding alone in a Bentley, 
declining to comment.

Parents of the bride: Jonathan Ashman, without Sian Lloyd, arrived to let his daughter go

Uninvited: Sian Lloyd, who married Suzanne Ashman's father Jonathan in 2007, allegedly made a comment about Suzanne's mother

A 
Turkish TV crew followed her every move, explaining that there was 
delight in Turkey that a former British Prime Minister was now connected
 to a distinguished Turkish family.

Euan Blair has been dating Suzanne for eight years, having been introduced by former Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon.

Miss
 Ashman read Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Trinity College, 
Oxford, after leaving the private St Paul’s Girls’ School in South-West 
London.

She met Euan Blair while on work experience with Mr Hoon and 
later worked at Tony Blair’s Faith Foundation. Last year, after working 
for American merchant bank Morgan Stanley, Euan became a business 
development manager at the Coventry-based Sarina Russo Job Access – part
 of the Government’s Work Programme – in a move said by some to be a 
stepping stone towards following his father into politics.

Reception: Gets have all made their way back to South Pavilion, the Blair's new Buckinghamshire mansion, for the wedding reception

Miss
 Lloyd, who once appeared on I’m a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here, met 
Jonathan Ashman at a St David’s Day party at the Palace of Westminster 
hosted by then Secretary of State for Wales Peter Hain in 2007.

Mr Ashman proposed to her in December that year at the foot of Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania while they were on holiday.

The couple married just weeks later at the Portmeirion Hotel in Gwynedd, Wales.
