The Winter Olympics at Sochi appear to being falling somewhat flat, as hardly any spectators turn up and senior officials complain the games have no buzz.

Photographs of Olympic venues show that entire banks of seats are practically deserted, while the one or two fans who did struggle out to see the world-class sporting events wrap up against the cold.

Embarrassingly, an American member of a top Olympic committee said that many of the Russian spectators were seeing the sports for the first time ever, and behaved without enthusiasm - except when Russian athletes took centre stage.

Anita DeFrantz, a U.S. member who sits on the policy-making executive board, said : 'Here,
 people are more reserved.

'There's not a lot of rah-rah, 
except for the Russian athletes who get a great reception.

'I think as 
time goes on and they get used to it, there will be more excitement. A 
lot of people have not seen these sports before.'

Gerhard Heiberg, a Norwegian who helped organise the acclaimed 1994 winter games in Lillehammer, called on Sochi's organisers to act over the empty stadiums.

It's easy to assume that cold temperatures could be keeping spectators away - but in fact, the Sochi Olympics are starting to feel more like the Summer Games.

On Monday, temperatures soared to 61F (16C), forcing skiers to put snow in their racing suits to cool down.

The mountain venues are expected to 
return to freezing Tuesday, organizers said. But from Wednesday, warmer 
weather is in the forecast.

Organizers said the temperature could reach 63F (16C) on Thursday.

At the RusSki Gorki Jumping Center, organizers canceled the first of three jumps after sunny skies softened the snow in the landing area.

To combat the possibility of high temperatures, organizers have been storing large amounts of snow and say they have enough to continue.

According to Mr Heiberg, despite the 
large volume of empty seats, it was still proving impossible to buy 
tickets for the clearly under-subscribed events.

He said: 'There are not enough people. 'They
 have to see to it they fill the stadiums.

'I understand that 
all tickets have been sold and people who want to buy tickets they 
cannot buy tickets, so they should do something about this to get school
 children, or students or even military people without uniforms out 
watching.'

Some events, like figure skating, have been packed. Others, like biathlon, have been half-empty.

The
 men's downhill - considered the marquee event of the Olympic Alpine ski
 schedule - failed to draw a full house Sunday, with a turnout of about 
6,000 fans at the 7,500-capacity venue.

Alpine
 skiing has little tradition in Russia and the games haven't pulled in 
the cowbell-ringing crowds familiar in Western Europe.

However, some events, such as figure 
skating, have had almost entirely Russian crowds. The speedskating venue
 was also noted for its boisterousness when the Russians or
 Dutch were racing.

Embarrassing: Sochi organisers have said they will start calling on volunteers to fill up empty venues

Bleak: Previous Olympics have also had problems with empty stadia

The 2012 summer Olympics in London were also plagued by a lack of spectators for the early events, which many complained was down to an excess of corporate seats which were not used.

Sochi organizers said today that they have started calling on volunteers to fill seats at less popular events.

Spokeswoman Alexandra Kosterina said some volunteers enrolled in a motivation program are offered tickets to see competition after hours.

'It depends on the events,' she said. 'If we see that there is not a turnout and there are seats available, then, yes, we invite some of the volunteers to join in.'
