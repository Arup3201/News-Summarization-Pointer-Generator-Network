These pictures of botched tattoos may make you think before you get inked. 

Luckily for the unfortunate few who have been left with inking mishaps, there are talented artists out there who can work miracles.

Lal Hardy, a tattooist at New Wave Studios, London, is tasked with turning disaster pieces into masterpieces.

Lal has shared some of the cover-ups he's most proud of and proves that with a bit of handiwork and a lot of experience, dodgy tattoos can be given a new lease of life.

Speaking about why people come to see him to have their inks modified, he said: 'The reasons really vary from some that are just plain bad, some designs are dated, some want bigger work or others are names of ex-lovers. 

'Personally, I am brutally honest with people regarding cover-ups. If I think it can't be covered I tell the client, the same if I think they have unrealistic expectations as to how a tattoo can be covered. I now only take on cover-ups or reworks that I feel will work.'

Four of Lal's most prized cover-ups include a lion design that was transformed from some squiggles into a fierce inking.

Speaking about the renovation work, he said: 'The lion was done by an amateur artist and because it was only partially done, it was possible to salvage it and cover it up.'

He also worked his magic on a faded design by transforming it into a bold and colourful rose. 

Another botched design he fixed was a faded Marilyn Monroe inking. 

'The cover up worked because the client researched a design he wanted, his original Monroe was faded and the new design had lots of detail and shading so lent itself well to a cover up,' said Lal.

More straightforward renovations include a robin playing card, which Lal re-vamped by changing it into a sparrow and adding a border to give a splash of colour to the new piece.

'The cover-up process depends on various factors like the size of the tattoo, how faded it is and the density of the dark pigments in it as darker colours are harder to cover,' he explained.

'The amount of clear skin around it is also a consideration as this can open up the opportunity to incorporate the cover-up in a bigger piece. The placement of the tattoo on the body can also be a major factor in whether or not a cover up can be done.'

Tattoo Nightmares airs at 9pm every Monday on truTV freeview channel 68 and Sky 565.
