While you were snoring in the middle of the night, Cameron Harder-Hutton was busy making history: he was single-handedly representing Australia in a world-wide video-call to Pope Francis.

The 17-year-old St. Joseph's Nudgee College student was selected by Catholic Education Australia from hundreds of students nominated for the role. The call, which happened at 1 am Eastern Standard Time this morning, was an initiative to connect youths from every continent with the Bishop of Rome. Cameron joined six others in the dialogue, which was hosted on the website Google hangouts.

Cameron told Daily Mail Australia the plan came out of the blue for him. ‘I only found out last week. I was chosen without really nominating myself; my school just told me ‘you’re going to speak with the Pope.’

Close company: Cameron was joined for the call by some of his St. Joseph's Nudgee College peers

‘At first I was like ‘are you sure?’ I was sceptical that it was legitimate. It was quite surreal, really.’

Cameron explained he was allowed to invite 20 guests.

‘I chose my mum and some close friends, the ones who were interested in social justice and would appreciate the invite.'

The year-12-student represented Australia by kicking things off with a true-blue greeting: ‘I introduced myself with a hearty g’day. After that, I was allowed to ask him one question of my choosing. I chose to ask him about the how getting young people from around the world into dialogue with each other, which is something my school is involved in, could make a difference to the world.'

Surreal: Cameron said he was sceptical if it was really going to happen when he  first heard about the call

Cameron said Pope Francis is more in tune with his generation than his forerunners, which is important since they are the future of the church

‘I was pretty nervous beforehand, though it helped that we did some rehearsals. I had to memorise everything to say to him without looking down.’

‘He was in Italy for the call. He actually spoke in Spanish and had a translator, but you could tell he was very passionate in his mannerisms, which was really humbling.’

‘Pope Francis is  in tune with my generation, which is excellent, because that’s where the future of the church lies. He’s asking followers of the church where they think the church is heading, rather than just telling them.’

Opportunist: Cameron capitalised on a chance to capture the moment by snapping a Pope-selfie

Cameron explained how he Pope Francis differs from his forerunners. ‘I think Pope Francis has distinguished himself through his forward thinking views on controversial issues like homosexuality and abortion.’

Lastly, Cameron explained how he capitalised on a memorable opportunity: ‘Pope Francis posed for a selfie last year in South Korea.  I decided to help myself to my own Pope-selfie. It had to be done.’
