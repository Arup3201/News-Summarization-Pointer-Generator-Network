A young Oxford University researcher who lost her eyebrows to Lupus has spoken about her devastation when her hair began falling out, and how she felt her life was being taken away from her.

Emily Savage-McGlynn, 34, had married her boyfriend Kevin the same year that she was diagnosed with Lupus, an autoimmune disease where the body's immune system becomes overactive and attacks normal, healthy tissue.

The psychology researcher said: 'I was devastated when I was diagnosed with Lupus. In addition to the 
physical pain that I experience inside, the disease started to change 
how I look on the outside, and that is very difficult to cope with.

'I 
used to have lovely full eyebrows and then suddenly I noticed they were 
becoming more and more sparse. By the end of it I was left with just two single hairs on each eyebrow. It looked dreadful.'

Effects of Lupus: Emily Savage-McGlynn, 34, began losing her eyebrow hair as a result of autoimmune disease Lupus, until there were only one or two strands left

Before the loss: Emily before she began losing her eyebrows to Lupus, an autoimmune diseases that affects the body's natural defence against illness and infection

Lupus can affect virtually any organ in the body and the condition resulted in Emily losing all the hair on her eyebrows except for a few strands.

Emily began covering up baldness by penciling in eyebrows every morning before going to work. But she hated the way her brows looked, and always felt self-conscious.

She explained: 'I spent around 10 minutes every single morning penciling them in. As I didn't have any hair at all, the pencil had nothing to blend into, so they just looked painted on and very unnatural.'

The chore of penciling eyebrows was not only time consuming, but Emily also felt restricted in doing some of her favourite activities and often missed out on swimming, one of her favourite past times.

She said: 'I love swimming, and when I started penciling in my eyebrows I had to stop because I was so self-conscious my eyebrows would wear off.

'Something I never even cared about before had such a huge impact on my life. It felt like Lupus was starting to take my life away from me.'

Ruining her life: Losing her eyebrows to Lupus made Emily feel as though the disease was robbing her of her life, and she began to get depressed

Happy whatever you look like: Emily with her husband Kevin, who said he loved her no matter what her eyebrows looked like and was reluctant for her to have the semi-permanent treatment

After years of pencilling in her eyebrows, Emily's sister Chloe suggested semi-permanent make-up as an option.

Lupus is a complex and poorly understood condition that affects many parts of the body and causes symptoms ranging from mild to life-threatening.

Some common symptoms of lupus include fatigue, skin rash, joint pain and swelling.

Lupus is an autoimmune condition, which means it is caused by problems with the immune system (the body's natural defence against illness and infection).

In people with lupus, for reasons not clearly understood, the immune system starts to attack healthy cells, tissue and organs.

As with other more common autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, it is thought a combination of genetic and environmental factors is responsible for triggering lupus in certain people.

But Kevin was reluctant for his wife to have a treatment.

She said: 'My husband didn’t want me to indulge in my insecurities and he told me I was beautiful just the way I was, he didn't even think penciling in my eyebrows was necessary.

'But I wasn’t worried about how others viewed me, I just wanted to feel good about myself again.”

Emily chose Debra Robson LDN for the 
treatment - a Harley Street clinic that uses the innovative FAME 
technique to mimic eyebrow hair at a microscopic level.

Emily recalls: 'I was very nervous, 
but Debra reassured me that she had done thousands of treatments - and 
soon I was getting the eyebrows that I'd missed for years.

'The
treatment was comfortable and all done within 30 minutes.

'When I saw my
eyebrows for the first time tears sprung into my eyes, I was overjoyed 
with the results. My eyebrows were completely natural, symmetrical and 
they looked just like real hair.

'I'm
so delighted and I finally feel like myself again. Everyone thought my 
new eyebrows looked wonderful, including my husband! People couldn't get
over how real they looked, even close up.'

The full look: Emily is thrilled with the result of her treatment, and says she finally feels like herself again

After the treatment: Emily's eyebrows following the semi-permanent FAME treatment she had in the Debra Robson LDN clinic

Debra Robson said: 'Emily came into the clinic with little hope and left feeling like herself again. We recreated Emily's brows with my renowned FAME technique, which builds up the brow at microscopic level, hair by hair. First we pencilled in the brow and got the correct shape for Emily's face.

'When she was happy with the shape, we began to build up her brows and as you can see from the pictures, the results were perfect.'
