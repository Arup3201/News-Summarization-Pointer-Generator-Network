Twitter is reportedly looking at ways to make money by selling people's tweets to other companies. 

These firms, known as 'data miners', would use the content in the tweets to personalise services from advertisers and marketers online, as well as in the real world. 

In an interview with The Guardian, Twitter’s data strategy chief Chris Moody said the data could also be used by police to gauge the mood of a football crowd, for example.

Many websites and services already sell data to third-parties in this way, but Mr Moody wants to expand its potential. 

He gave one example of a grandparent travelling on a plane to see their newborn grandson. 

The airline would know of their impending trip from their tweets and when they arrive they would greet the user by name. 

Twitter's boss recently admitted the social network 'sucks' at dealing with trolls and now the site is making good on its promise to clamp down on these abusive accounts. 

Reports claim the site will start banning users who violate its rules by tracking  email addresses and phone numbers. 

It also recently added new tools to make it easier for users to report abuse and send these reports to law enforcement. 

A gift-wrapped rattle would then be on the user's seat.  

'You bring your data to us and we will ensure that your customers, if they exist on Twitter - we can provide advertisements to them,' explained the 48-year-old. 

'Twitter gives this fascinating ability to understand people in context like we’ve never been able to do before.'

He stressed that this would be done anonymously and no private information is shared. 

Plus, unless tweets are protected, they can be searched for and viewed easily already. 

As a result there are firms that have developed their own mining software to extract information from tweets.

Mr Moody was previously chief executive at Gnip, a social data provider which Twitter bought in April last year. 

Gnip delivers more than 5 billion social activities per day and its network of companies includes more than 95 per cent of the Fortune 500.

By comparison, Twitter has 288 million monthly active users and figures quoted by The Guardian's Juliette Garside said sales of data on the site amount to around $70 million (£47 million) in revenue each year.
