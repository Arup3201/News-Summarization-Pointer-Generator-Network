They made their names creating music. But more and more celebrities are making their fortunes selling perfume.

Yesterday it emerged that fragrances from stars such as Britney Spears, Beyoncé and Cheryl Fernandez-Versini are outselling established fragrance brands such as Hugo Boss and Gucci in some stores.

Miss Spears's perfumes are so popular that they outsell DKNY by three to one at Superdrug, and Hugo Boss by two to one.

Having sold more than two million bottles since launching her first perfume in 2004, Miss Spears, 33, is regarded the Queen of celebrity fragrance.

She is the only star to have appeared in every one of Superdrug's top ten bestseller lists since they were first compiled in 2006.

At around £15 per 100ml, her range is one of the cheaper on sale.But she faces a fight to hold onto her crown. 

This year's No1 is Jay z with his GOLD fragrance, which sells three times as many bottles as Red by Lacoste.

At No2 is the rapper's wife, Beyonce, with a fragrance called Rise that is outselling Gucci's Envy by three to one.

Marc Jacobs’ Daisy will be outperformed on the same scale by X Factor judge Mrs Fernandez-Versini’s Stormflower, according to the high street beauty chain.

One Direction’s You & I, also outperforms Calvin Klein’s Eternity by three to one.

Royal Revolution by Katy Perry is expected to sell three bottles for every one of D&G’s Light Blue, Issey Miyake will be beaten threefold by Rihanna’s Rogue. And Lady Gaga’s Eau de Gaga is expected to beat Jean Paul Gaultier by three.

However none of the singers to turn their hands to perfume making have enjoyed quite the same level of success as Miss Spears.

Miss Spears, a mother of two, has created 16 scents overall, with names like Curious and Naughty & Nice Remix.

Last night Simon Comins, Superdrug Buying Director said Miss Spears’ continued success was unrivalled by any other celebrity.

He said: ‘Britney is the undisputed queen of celebrity fragrance. Looking back over the years there have been many entries into the fragrance market but few have the staying power of Britney.

‘Famous names such as Naomi Campbell, Cindy Crawford and Colleen Rooney have all featured in the best-sellers charts over the years but Britney is the only celebrity to feature on our very first official chart in 2006 and every single chart up to this year’s.’
