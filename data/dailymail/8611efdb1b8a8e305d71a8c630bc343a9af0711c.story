Increasing exposure to selfies is pushing more Americans to go under the knife, according to specialists.

A poll conducted by the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery earlier this year found that one in three surgeons said they noticed more patients noted social media when asking for surgical procedures in 2013 compared to 2012.

Individual surgeons have noticed the growing trend of selfies driving plastic surgery.

Selfie-conscious: Increasing exposure to selfies is pushing more Americans to go under the knife, according to specialists.

'There has been a 25 percent increase over the past year and a half to two years,' Dr Sam Rizk told Reuters.

He's even had to turn away patients from his Manhattan practice who were troubled by how they looked in self portraits on social media - and encountered anger for his efforts.

'I refuse a significant proportion of patients with selfies because I believe it is not a real image of what they actually look like in person,' he said. 

Distortion can occur when a mobile phone or other digital device is held too close to the subject, resulting in an image that does not reflect the person's look.

'They come in with their iPhones and show me pictures,' Rizk stated. 'Selfies are just getting to be so crazy.'

'Too many selfies indicate a self obsession and a certain level of insecurity that most teenagers have. It just makes it worse,' he said.

'Now they can see themselves in 100 images a day on Facebook and Instagram.'

Demand: Dr Sam Rizk said he's had to turn away patients at his Manhattan office because he felt the procedures they wanted were unnecessary  - and encountered anger for his efforts

Though the AAFPRS poll did not specify how many respondents were surveyed from among its 2,700-member organization, it found doctors noted an increasing demand last year.

The poll revealed a 10 percent increase in rhinoplasty procedures - also known as nose jobs - along with a 7 percent increase in hair transplant procedures and a 6 percent increase in eyelid surgery.

'Social platforms like Instagram, Snapchat and the iPhone app Selfie.im, which are solely image based, force patients to hold a microscope up to their own image and often look at it with a more self-critical eye than ever before,' said AAFPRS President Edward Farrior in the press release. 

'These images are often the first impressions young people put out there to prospective friends, romantic interests and employers and our patients want to put their best face forward.'

Bullying was also said to be a factor, as respondents noted that children and adolescents were looking for the surgery after being bullied by others.
