Shocking: Lewis Eddleston was playing in a field when he left them for a moment - and never returned

The family of a 13-year-old boy who was found dead in a ditch three days after he went missing have described him as 'a shining light and a character with a big heart'.

Lewis Eddleston’s body was found near his Doncaster home on Wednesday. He had drowned, police have said.

Today, his family released a statement that said: 'Lewis was a shining light and a character with a big heart, always managing to make you smile in any situation.'

The family said Lewis loved music and would always try to 'push the boundaries on the household’s decibel limit'.

The statement said: 'Lewis was ‘mummy’s boy’ and always managed to wriggle out of situations.

'Lewis touched all of our lives in the way that a piece of the family jigsaw will always be missing.

'He loved his nieces and nephew, always wanting to be involved in their lives and daily activities.'He will be sorely missed by all of us who love him.

'We are proud to have enjoyed our time with Lewis and looked forward to celebrating his 14th birthday, with him, this coming Sunday.'

The family thanked everyone who had helped to find Lewis and who had supported them this week.

They said: 'At times he may not have been an angel but now he’s an angel looking down on all who loved him.'

Yesterday, his brother Michael said the family was 'very angry' with the police response after Lewis went missing on Sunday.

He said: 'We’ve been on our own, apart from the community.

A post-mortem examination revealed Lewis died from drowning soon after he was seen leaving playing fields on Sunday evening.

His death is not being treated as suspicious.

Friends of a 13-year-old boy who drowned after leaving them playing in fields near his home have written him an anguished note saying: 'Wish we followed you'.

Bouquets of flowers, cards and pictures were laid in the field where popular Lewis was found - which can be seen from his house.

One tribute read: 'Going to miss you loads bro. Wish we followed you.

'Going to miss you and your typical but amazing ways. Love you millions. Lewis Eddleston RIP. Bro rest in peace. Love you.'

Other emotional messages said: 'To my prince Lewis. Thinking of you always. Lots of love. I love you. Leonie xxxx' and 'My beautiful Lewis Eddleston. Rest in peace gorgeous. I won’t forget you. Lots of love Katie'.

Another said: 'To Lewis RIP dude your (sic) never going to be forgotten. I love you my little soldier. Lots of love Kirstie.'

The brightly coloured flowers were laid against a gate on Hunger Hill Lane.

Graham Wakeling, the head teacher of 
Hungerhill School, which Lewis attended, said: 'The school community is 
devastated by the news of Lewis's sudden death which was a shock to us 
all.

'Our thoughts and condolences are 
with his family and close friends at this very difficult time. Lewis was
an extremely popular young man with a good sense of humour.

'He was a lively character around the
school and always had a smile on his face. Lewis will be sadly missed 
by pupils and staff at Hungerhill.'

Jack Neal, 14, said he was in the 
same school year as Lewis. 'He liked to have fun,' Jack said. 'He always
had a laugh. He was a good friend.'

Jack's mother Clair Neal said: 
'There's a lot of youngsters this age feeling pretty devastated.
There's lots of upset people. I spoke to a few of the mums that've got 
children in the same year. He was such a well-liked boy.'

A neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: 'Lewis 
was a lovely lad, everyone knew him. We are a close knit community and 
this will hit us hard.'
