If you've ever looked to the skies and studied the clouds, you may have made out a shape or two.

But the shape of this formation above a beach near Sunderland is easy to spot.

The unusual wave like clouds were spotted above Roker Lighthouse on Seaburn beach this afternoon by photographer Paul Kingston.

The crest-shaped cloud formation is caused by a series of water, damp and windy conditions coming together at the same time at about 5,000 meters in the air.

A Met Office forecaster explains: 'It looks like a Kelvin-Helmholtz wave.

'When you have different layers of 
air travelling at different speeds, along with changes in temperature 
and density, then it can lead to this wave-like formation.

'The air higher up overlaps the slower-moving air below - but it is the changes in temperature and density which creates the shape.

'It is fairly uncommon to see such a clear example of it.'

The wave clouds are not uncommon, as seen in Sunderland today, but says a Met Office forecaster: 'It is fairly uncommon to see such a clear example of it'

Photographer and weather buff Mr Kingston, who lives in 
the north of England, and who took these pictures, added: 'I was photographing the sea and the surfers 
off Seaburn Beach when I looked up about 40 degrees and saw the waves in
the clouds.

'I knew what they were, and that they're fairly rare, caused by turbulence about 5,000 meters up in the air.

'I'd seen them on TV before, but not in real life. They weren't there for very long - only about 30 seconds and then they were gone.'
