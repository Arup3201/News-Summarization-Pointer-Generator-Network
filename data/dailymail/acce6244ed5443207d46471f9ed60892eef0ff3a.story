The Queen's London residence is exposed to the highest levels of air pollution in the country, figures reveal today.

Traffic traveling along the A302 - known as Grosvenor Place - which runs adjacent to Buckingham Palace, produced the highest levels of toxic gas nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in 2012, data shows.

Figures from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs show the average level of the gas - produced mainly from diesel engine traffic fumes - was 152 micrograms per cubic metres of air.

Traffic along Grosvenor Place - which runs adjacent to the Palace - produced the highest levels of toxic gas nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in 2012 at 152 micrograms per cubic metres of air

The figure is almost four times the European legal limit of 40 micrograms per cubic metre.

Lower Grosvenor Place, another road close to the Palace, registered as 109 micrograms per cubic metre.

Other highly polluted areas include Oxford Street near Marble Arch, which registered at 150 micrograms and Cockspur Street near Trafalgar Square on 138 micrograms.

The fourth and fifth locations were Park Lane and Knightsbridge - which measured 135 and 134 micrograms respectively.

Roads near other top London tourist attractions such as Madam Tussauds, Hamleys Toy Shop and  Covent Garden also featured on the list of 50 worst offenders - ALL of which were in London.

Outside London, Manchester Piccadilly scored 68, Belfast City Centre 63 and Nottingham City Centre 59 micrograms per cubic metre.

Almost 30,000 people die every year due to respiratory problems caused by air pollution. Nitrogen dioxide in particular has been linked to breathing issues.

Today environmental groups criticised the statistics.

Simon Birkett, Founder and Director of Clean Air in London, said: 'These levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) are nothing short of staggering. 

'The World Health Organisation guideline is no human exposure in a single hour over 200 micrograms per cubic metre (with an annual average guideline of 40).

Oxford Street near Trafalgar Square measured 150 micrograms per cubic metre

'The thought that hundreds of thousands or millions of tourists and Londoners in a year may be exposed to air pollution this high is deeply troubling. 

'In London, we need the Mayor to: ban the oldest cars emitting carcinogenic diesel exhaust as Berlin did more than four years ago, remove the turning circle requirement that still forces cabbies to choose between two large diesel taxis if they want a new vehicle and reinstate Phase 5 of the low emission zone that was a key commitment in the Mayor’s Air Quality Strategy until scrapped early last year.

'He also needs to ensure his ultra-low emission zone for 2020 includes the roads with the highest NO2 rather than excluding them which will force the most-polluting vehicles to join those avoiding the congestion charging zone and issue smog warnings to save lives, avoid hospitalisations and build public understanding of air pollution.

Cockspur Street had the third highest levels of N02 at 138 micrograms

'In short, ‘invisible’ air pollution is where smoking was 30 years ago in terms of the known health risks and the lack of public awareness.  People need Prince Charles to champion action to comply with air pollution laws in London and elsewhere.'

The UK faces fines of up to £300m from the European commission after they launched legal action due to a failure to reduce high levels of NO2 air pollution from traffic.

The commission said this was despite over a decade of warnings and several extensions and postponements given to the British government.

Other European countries have also failed to meet the air quality directive, the commission said.

A Defra spokesman said: 'Air quality has improved significantly in recent decades. Just like for other Member States, meeting the NO2 limit values alongside busy roads has been a challenge.

'That is why we are investing heavily in transport measures to improve air quality around busy roads and we are working with the Commission to ensure this happens as soon as possible.'

Park Lane had 135 micrograms per cubic metre. The data follows the news the European Commission is to take legal action against the UK for its failure to lower levels of the toxic gas

Knightsbridge measured 134 micrograms. Environmental groups have today slammed the data, saying the findings are 'nothing short of staggering'

The highlighted that the UK meets the EU air quality limit values for all other air pollutants.

Responding to the latest figures, a spokesman for Boris Johnson said: London’s air quality is steadily improving, meeting legal limits for eight out of nine EU regulated pollutants.

'Since the Mayor was elected NO2 emissions have reduced by 20 per cent and the number of people living in areas exceeding NO2 limits has halved but he fully recognises the need to take further action.

'This includes the introduction of the world's first Ultra-Low Emission Zone in central London from 2020, tougher requirements for taxis from 2018 and a £20million fund to tackle local problem areas.

'These most ambitious measures will deliver enormous economic and environmental benefits for central London and will make this global city an even better place to live, work and visit.'
