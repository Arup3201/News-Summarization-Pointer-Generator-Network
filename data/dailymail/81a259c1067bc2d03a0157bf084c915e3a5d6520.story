It's the battle of the Christmas adverts - and Apple's definitely not going down without a fight.

The mega-tech brand just debuted its 2014 holiday offering and, aside from promoting the new Macbook Air and iPad Mini 3, the commercial is also heavy on emotion. 

The ad, entitled 'The Song,' begins with a teenage girl finding an old recording of her grandmother, Valerie, singing the jazz song Love Is Here to Stay to her late husband, Raymond.

Her grandmother had recorded a jazz standard for her late husband many years ago

Her teenage granddaughter then works her magic - using software on her Macbook Air laptop, of course - to turn the track into a duet, adding in her own vocals.

Fast forward to Christmas morning, when grandma Valerie comes downstairs to find an iPad Mini 3 on the kitchen table, encouraging her to press play.

As she listens to the DIY track, she looks through several photos of her and Raymond - as well as her granddaughter - alone on Christmas morning.  

As a Christmas surprise, the granddaughter records her own voice in - creating a sentimental duet

Grandma is moved by her granddaughter's touching gesture, tearing up upon first listen
