Quids in: Karen Griggs is £5,000 she lost in 2007 was handed in to police

When Karen Griggs’ handbag, stuffed with £5,000 in cash, went missing she reported it to the police.

But she soon gave up hope that the bag – or the money - would ever be found.

Now the bag has been found exactly where she had forgotten she left it, on a peg in a church in Devon, six years after she reported it missing.

And even more miraculously, all the money was still there.

The 47-year-old said: 'I feel so stupid. I must have left it in the church but obviously I didn’t realise that, and I reported it stolen to the police.

'I thought it had been stolen from my home. It is crazy that I have got the money back after all this time.

'I can’t believe that it’s just been 
hanging on the same peg where I left it in the same holdall with my bank
cash card in it, exactly where I must have left it.

'It is an amazing story but I feel embarrassed. I used to go into a lot of churches in Brixham to pray at the time and I don’t even know which one found it.

'I would like to know so that I can give a donation to church funds to thank them.'

US-born Mrs Griggs had been on her way to the bank to change the money into dollars ahead of a trip back to her place of birth in 2007, when she had popped into a church and absentmindedly left it there.

Puzzled police in Brixham have described its sudden and unexpected reappearance as 'one in a million'.

The money was so old that the notes were out-of-date and had to be replaced by the Bank of England.

Brixham PC Tim Perrin said: 'The church couldn’t say how long it had been there before they looked 
inside and found all these bundles of £20 notes.

'A very nice lady from the church came and handed it in to Brixham police station.

'We did some research and discovered that it had been reported stolen in 2007 from a Brixham home.

'In all my experience as a policeman 
this is a one in a million. It is very strange. A cash card was still 
with it and that’s how we traced it back.

Honest: The money was found at a church in the quaint Devonshire town of Brixham

'The people at the church are very modest about what they did in returning it and don’t want any publicity.

'The owner wanted to thank them for their honesty but they want to remain anonymous.'

Mrs Griggs hit the headlines in 2009 for 
another case of forgetfulness when she left her keys in her car and a 
thief stole it.

What he did not realise was her 9st dog - a Great Dane, Alsatian cross called Diesal - was dozing peacefully on the back seat.

When the giant hound woke up, the terrified thief ran off with his tail between his legs.

At the time Karen’s husband Nick, 41, said: 'I’d love to have seen the look on his face when he saw Diesel in the mirror.

'He must have got the shock of his life.
There’s no alarm on the car but who needs one when you’ve got the Hound
of the Baskervilles on your back seat?'

Speaking about the latest incident, Mr Griggs said the £5,000 would come in handy as the couple were planning to build a series of five star eco lodges on former MoD land at a local beauty spot of Berry Head.

He added: 'It’s fantastic that this money has come to light now. It couldn’t have come at a better time.'
