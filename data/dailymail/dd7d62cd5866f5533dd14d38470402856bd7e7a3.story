Despite reports Apple’s iPhone 6 Plus bends in a pocket, and critics claiming its a carbon-copy of Samsung devices - its popularity hasn’t been dented.

T-Mobile boss chief executive John Legere has revealed that the larger, phablet device is 'exceeding expectations' - and is on par with the smaller iPhone 6 model.

He said he had expected the Plus model to make up around 20 per cent of sales, but this figure has been closer to 45 per cent.

T-Mobile boss chief executive John Legere (pictured) has revealed that the iPhone 6 Plus is exceeding expectations, and is on par with the smaller iPhone 6 model. He said he had expected the Plus model to make up around 20 per cent of sales, but this figure was closer to 45 per cent

Mr Legere was talking at Recode’s Code/Mobile event in Moon Bay California.

He admitted the figures were more than twice the sales his firm had expected.

These figures bolster those observed on the weekend the two devices were released back in September.

A Piper Jaffray survey found the larger model was outselling the smaller version, and analyst Gene Munster said at the time the Plus was ‘more popular’.

The iPhone 6 has a 4.7-inch screen, while the iPhone 6 Plus 5.5-inches.

Both models include the Apple-designed A8 chip with second generation 64-bit desktop-class architecture, said to boost performance and power efficiency.

They also have advanced iSight and FaceTime HD cameras, and users in the US will also be able to use the devices to pay for goods using Apple Pay.

Besides larger screens, the new phones offer faster performance and a wireless chip for making credit card payments.

In the US, the iPhone 6 starts at $199 for 32GB on a two-year contact, $299 for 64GB and $399 for 128GB.

A SIM-only handset starts at £539 in the UK.

The iPhone 6 Plus costs $299 on a two-year contract for 16GB, $399 for 64GB, $499 for 128GB.

Unlocked, the handset starts at £619 in the UK. 

In a survey, 57 per cent of shoppers intended to buy the iPhone Plus. 

With the larger screen, as well as the storage options, cited as the main driving forces.

Prior to the release, the firm said it expected customers would ‘overwhelmingly’ prefer the smaller iPhone 6 - seen as the direct upgrade to the iPhone 5S.

Figures from marketing firm Localytics earlier this month, however, reported a skew in the opposite direction.

By studying app usage and analytics across a range of devices, its figures show the iPhone 6 taking 6 per cent market share, compared to the Plus model’s one per cent.

The firm also found that the iPhone 6 is being adopted at twice the rate of its iPhone 5S predecessor - which had a 3 per cent share of all iPhones at this time last year.

Although people who have bought the larger model are using it more.

According to Localytics, the iPhone 6 Plus has ‘stronger user engagement’ with 13 per cent longer session length, and 11 per cent more app launches than the iPhone 6.

Currently, last year’s iPhone 5S is the most popular model among consumers at 27 per cent of all iPhones. 

Following the launch in September, Apple reported it sold more than 10 million iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models over the first weekend - a three-day record for a new model. 

According to app analytics firm Localytics, the iPhone 6 Plus has ‘stronger user engagement’ too, with 13 per cent longer session length, and 11 per cent more app launches than the iPhone 6

Following the launch, Apple reported it sold more than 10 million iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models (pictured) in a weekend - a three-day record for a new model. This beat the previous record of 9 million for last year's iPhone 5S and 5C

This beat the previous record of 9 million for last year's iPhone 5S and 5C.

And during initial benchmark tests by Anandtech, the iPhone 6 was found to have the fastest web browsing and page loading times on any device, just ahead of the iPhone 6 Plus.

The iPhone 6 also performed well in graphics testing, coming second with an average frame per second rate of 49.5. This was only behind the NVIDIA Shield tablet, on 57.1.

The iPhone 5S was third, on 40.2, followed by the iPhone 6 Plus on 34.4.

Furthermore, the display on the iPhone 6 Plus was praised by experts at DisplayMate, who called the screen ‘the best performing smartphone LCD’ the site has ever tested.

But, other figures from Localytics report a sales skew in the opposite direction. By studying app usage and analytics across a range of devices, its figures show the iPhone 6 taking 6 per cent market share, compared to the Plus model’s one per cent (pictured)
