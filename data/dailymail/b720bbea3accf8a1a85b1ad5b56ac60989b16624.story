Three days before Christmas, 85-year-old widow Twila McCauley trembled as she opened a red, git-wrapped box.

From it she picked out a silver bracelet that has been lost for almost 70 years.

It was gift worn by her late husband Warren as he fought the Nazis in the Italian mountains in 1945.

He mislaid the bracelet and its location was unknown, but now it has been returned to the Orange County family.

Mr McCauley was 19 when he served in the Army. He won the Bronze Star while fighting off German regiments on the Tuscan Coast in Italy. He is pictured left in St Mark's Square in Venice 

Mrs McCauley was joined by her family in an Orange County home as she opened the package containing the relic three days before Christmas 

The pair met in the summer of 1945 when she was 18-years-old, they married a year later and had their first child a short while after.  He died in 1986 after suffering attack in his family home. 

Gazing at the seven-inch silver bracelet as she took it out of the box, Mrs McCauley told NBC: 'It's unreal to hold it now. It's just so amazing.'

Mr McCauley, an Army trombone player who won the Bronze Star, arrived with the 10th Mountain Division in the Italian town of Castel D'Anio in March 1945.

Prior to that he had been part of a major counter-offensive that destroyed five German regiments on the Tuscan coast over a period of three months.

In the town, parts of which doubled as a field hospital, they drank cognac and champage as the German's surrendered in May.

Mr McCauley passed away from a heart attack in their family home in 1986 

Bruna de Maria was an eight-year-old child living in the town which had been destroyed by war. Her father had hung a white sheet on their home saying it served as a field hospital and a canteen.

There, when the Germans left, she found the silver bracelet owned by Mr McCauley and has kept it on her bedside table ever since.

She told NBC: 'I just took it, I was very poor, so a bracelet for me was a treasure.

'I always asked myself, who does it belong to? But I never tried to find the man. It almost felt as if it were mine.

Her son Stefano Sedda then got hold of it and said the previous owner should be discovered. 

He told the station: 'This bracelet made history. It belonged to an American soldier who came her to fight, to defend our country—that's why I thought of giving it back.'

After trying to decipher what the name and serial number on it related to, he handed it to a dinner guest who then emailed an image to a lawyer named Carolyn Thompson.

Through an NBC journalist they contacted Dennis Hagen, the official archivist for the 10th Mountain Division. His private search by the number of the bracelet produced a name, Warren D. McCauley. This led them to his widow Mrs McCauley. 

When she was first called about the bracelet, she said: 'I'm about to hit the floor. You know the Lord, He is really there—have you ever felt him close? I can feel him now.'

'He just had that great big beautiful smile,' Mrs McCauley added, 'and I remember him that way.' 

Mr McCauley was part of the 10th Mountain Division that defeated five German regiments in the space of three months along the Tuscan coast
