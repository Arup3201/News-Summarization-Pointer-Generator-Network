Julia Gillard's former boyfriend and ex-union official Bruce Wilson has admitted he charged a construction company without providing them any of the training services he promised for almost a year.

Thiess was invoiced by the Australian Workers' Union Workplace Reform Assocation, an alleged slush fund legally established by Julia Gillard and operated by Mr Wilson as treasurer.

It is alleged that the money paid by Thiess was in part used to pay for Mr Wilson's home at Fitzroy in Melbourne.

'The training work that you say was done began in the beginning of 1993,' counsel assisting the commission Jeremy Stoljar said, addressing Mr Wilson.

'So no training [of] the workers was done by the association for the calendar year 1992?'Mr Wilson told the royal commission into union corruption that was correct.

'I had some access to some paper work and I had looked at some things but in terms of on the site, that's correct,' he said, adding that self-confessed union bagman and associate Ralph Blewitt knew this as well.

Mr Wilson denied the invoices were fraudulent, saying that the agreement was like a legal retainer between a law firm and a client.

'The agreement between Thiess and ourselves [was] that we would invoice them from the beginning of the contract to the nominated end of the contract,' he said.

'If for whatever reason you don't do legal work you still send the bill, I bet,' Mr Wilson said.

The Royal Commission into union corruption is investigating union slush fund activity and whether money from the Australian Workers' Union funded the renovations of Julia Gillard's house

The royal commission into trade union governance and corruption is examining whether money was used to pay for renovations at Ms Gillard's Abbotsford property as well.

Bruce Wilson was also confronted with a denial from beyond the grave by the man he says was central to a purported workplace safety scheme that has been described as a corrupt union slush fund.

Mr Wilson told the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption on Thursday that the late Glen Ivory had been appointed as training officer on a Western Australia building site on behalf of the Workplace Reform Association (WRA), the organisation he set up with the assistance of his then-girlfriend and union lawyer Ms Gillard.

However Mr Wilson was presented with a statement, made by Mr Ivory before his death, in which the one-time president of the WA branch of the Australian Workers' Union said no training officer was ever appointed and he was never aware of around $2,000 a week billed to construction firm Thiess to pay for the role.

Mr Ivory died in 2004 but in a statement given to West Australian police in 1997, said the union had never authorised establishing the WRA or opening bank accounts in its name.

Counsel assisting the commission, Jeremy Stoljar SC, asked Mr Wilson if his evidence that Mr Ivory was the training officer, was false.

Mr Wilson denied that and questioned Mr Ivory's statement.

'I would like to know who prepared this statement for Ivory because it wasn't him,' Mr Wilson said.

Mr Stoljar said: 'There seem to be a long list of people, according to you, who are not telling the truth.'

'You have used the name of the late Mr Ivory knowing that he's no longer with us and can't defend himself, is that right?,' Mr Stoljar said.

Mr Wilson replied: 'Not at all. In fact I wish he was.'

Yesterday, a builder told the commission that Mr Wilson paid for the renovations of Ms Gillard's home in 1993.

Athol James, 84, said that he was paid by Julia Gillard for the renovations, who in turn was funded by cash payments from Mr Wilson, suggesting for the first time that there was a direct link between the former prime minister and the union funds.

'During the work I would deal with Ms Gillard in relation to any payment for the completed work,' Mr James said.

'I would give her the invoice. I am pretty certain she said she would get money from Bruce and pay me in the next few days. I'm certain she said Bruce was paying for it.'

Mr James replaced some doors and windows in the home between March and June 1993 at a cost of $6,040 according to invoices tendered in the commission.

In August a further invoice of $2,986 was submitted by Mr James' company for fencing and flooring at the home.

One of Mr Wilson's former employees, Wayne Hem, a researcher and librarian for the Australian Workers' Union, also told the commission yesterday that in 1995 Mr Wilson gave him $5,000 to deposit in Ms Gillard's account.

'He took a wad of notes out of his pocket and he wrote on a piece of paper a bank account number,' Mr Hem said in his witness statement,' Mr Hem said of Mr Wilson.

'He handed me the cash and the piece of paper and asked me to deposit the cash.

'I looked at the paper, asked him to tell whose account it was, and handed him the piece of paper back so that he could write the details on the paper for me.

'He then wrote Julia Gillard on the piece of paper and handed it back to me.'

Mr Hem counted the money and deposited it at the Commonwealth Bank in Carlton before returning to the office, he told the commission.
