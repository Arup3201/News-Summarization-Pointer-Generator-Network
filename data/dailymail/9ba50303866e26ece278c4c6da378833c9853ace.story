A convicted cannabis grower who attacked two students was spared jail – so he could get married and go on his honeymoon.

Unemployed Lee Moss, 40, was already serving a 12-month suspended sentence for running a drug farm when he punched two young men in a takeaway following a night out.

Although Moss should have been sent to prison for breaching the terms of his sentence, a judge said jailing him would ‘ruin his life’ and freed him.

Free: A judge spared Lee Moss, right, a jail term so he would be free to marry long-term partner Michelle Bell, left, despite a vicious and unprovoked attack on two students

Judge Andrew Woolman, sitting at 
Preston Crown Court, handed Moss a six-week home curfew, ending in time 
for his big day and honeymoon to Egypt next month.

The judge said: ‘It would destroy your
 life in the short term if I was to imprison you immediately – you would
 not be able to attend your wedding.’

Moss, who the court heard had also 
failed to complete the community service element of his sentence, is due
 to marry his long-standing girlfriend, Michelle Bell, 39, on June 24.

The couple, who have two children 
together, had already paid a ‘large amount’ towards the ceremony and are
 due to go on an 11-day honeymoon on June 29.

Jeremy Grout-Smith, prosecuting, told 
the hearing that Moss’s victims – students Paul Larkin, 20, and Joshua 
Kareem, 19 – had spent the evening of March 7 at the Old Dog pub in 
Preston.

They stopped at a takeaway on their way home, when, at around 4am, they were attacked by Moss, who had been drinking.

‘They were in the takeaway, sitting 
waiting, when a man they didn’t know, the defendant, approached Mr 
Larkin,’ Mr Grout-Smith said.

‘He [Moss] said something to him, 
which he couldn’t recall, grabbed him by the shoulders, then punched him
 to the face, causing a swollen lip.

‘The incident was captured on CCTV, 
which shows Moss punching him in the mouth without provocation, and then
 he attempts to hit him again, but misses and hits Mr Kareem.’ Police 
were called to the scene and arrested Moss, who was carrying half a gram
 of cocaine.

When questioned, Moss claimed the 
students had been guilty of ‘offensive behaviour’ earlier in the 
evening. But, Mr Grout-Smith, said: ‘There is no evidence to support 
that.’

Mr Kareem, who later made a claim for 
compensation, told police he suffered bruising and pain down the side of
 his face for three days after the attack, and back pain.

Mr Grout-Smith added: ‘He said the incident had made him very wary and frightened of going out in Preston at night.’

Moss admitted two offences of assault and possession of a Class A drug.

The court heard he had three previous 
convictions, two of which involved drugs. In 2008, Moss was cautioned 
for possession of a Class A drug and, in August last year, he received a
 12-month jail sentence, suspended for 12 months, for producing a Class B
 drug after police discovered a cannabis factory in Blackburn.

Smirking: Judge Andrew Woolman ruled that if he imprisoned Lee Moss, right, causing the postponement of his wedding to Michelle Bell, left, it would 'destroy' his life in the short term

Moss claimed he had set up the factory, which included 91 plants and 35 seedlings, because he owed money to drug dealers.

Edmund Haygarth, defending, said Moss 
assaulted the students because he thought they were among a group of 
young men he had seen ‘bullying’ a young girl earlier in the evening.

However, he later admitted being high on drink and cocaine and that it could have been a case of mistaken identity.

Mr Haygarth said Moss was trying to 
find work as a labourer, but that he had not completed unpaid work, part
 of his previous sentence, because of a bad knee injury.

Moss was sentenced to four months in 
jail, suspended for two years. The judge also extended his existing 
suspended sentence for growing cannabis to two years.

It is understood Miss Bell had taken out a £10,000 loan to pay for the couple’s wedding and honeymoon.

Last night Moss, who has two sons aged nine and four, said the judge had ‘saved his life’ by allowing him to walk free.

He added: ‘We both feared the worst 
and Michelle has been a nervous wreck. I was so sure I wouldn’t be going
 on the honeymoon I told her to look at taking a friend.’
