Australia has emerged as the top country with the most overpriced housing market in the world, with properties overvalued by 33 per cent.

In the latest issue of The Economist, the nation's property prices are measured against average incomes and topples Canada, New Zealand and France for the number spot.

The country's position as one of the most expensive housing markets is further solidified when comparing prices and rents.

Under this comparison, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Canada and Belgium are the only four countries which have higher overvaluation than Australia, sitting on 55 per cent.

According to the same data, China is undervalued on 38 per cent.

This is accounted for by the Chinese market being flooded with properties as newly constructed apartment buildings sit empty around built-up areas, according to Property Observer.

But it is a different story at home where demand for Australian properties has exceeded supply, which accounts for the increase in prices.

Australia has come out on top as the nation that has the most overvalued real estate in the world after a record growth of 4.2 per cent in housing prices

This comes as new figures show house prices in Australian capital cities have recorded their strongest gains in winter since 2007, increasing by 4.2 per cent in the three months to the end of August.

RP Data figures showed Melbourne and Sydney were the only capital cities to record double-digit dwelling value growth over the past year.

Melbourne outperformed Sydney over winter but Sydney was the leader year-on-year, with house prices increasing 16.2 per cent in Sydney compared with 11.7 percent in Melbourne.

All other capital cities trailed behind with Adelaide recording a 5.9 percent rise year-on-year, followed by Brisbane with 5.4 percent, Darwin with 5.4 per cent, Perth with 3.5 per cent, Hobart 2.8 per cent and Canberra with 1.4 perc ent.

RP Data research director Tim Lawless said Sydney and Melbourne housing markets were driving these two tier conditions.

He added that he expected dwelling values to increase again this Spring.

'Considering the ongoing high rate of auction clearance rates, a generally rapid rate of sale and the ongoing low interest rate environment, it's likely that dwelling values rise even further over the next three months,' Mr Lawless said.

'Consumer confidence is also moving in the right direction now after the post-budget slump which will add fuel to the exuberant buying and selling conditions we have seen during winter.'
