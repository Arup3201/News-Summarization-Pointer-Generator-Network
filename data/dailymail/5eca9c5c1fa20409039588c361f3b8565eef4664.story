Motorists may be forced to pay more to get their cars serviced after the industry's peak body froze out small and independent mechanics in a new code of conduct.

The Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries has issued its own voluntary code of conduct for car servicing that stops smaller workshops from accessing complete maintenance data and specialist tools that new-car dealership service centres are entitled to.

The move has been criticised by the Australian Automobile Association - the body for motorists - who claim it will reduce choice for consumers and force them into more expensive dealership servicing programs.

'This shows complete arrogance and contempt on behalf of the car makers,' Andrew McKellar, chief executive of the Association told News Corp.

'(The FCAI) is demonstrating little concern for the consumer and they are gunning for independent repairers and service providers. That's a bad thing for consumers as it reduces choice and reduces competition.

'The new code has so many loopholes and so many exclusions as to make it utterly worthless.

'It is a complete con. They're putting forward the appearance they're doing the right thing but if you dig into the detail it heavily restricts what is available (to local mechanics).' 

Smaller mechanics have argued that as vehicles become more modern and technologically advanced, they need more access to maintenance information than stipulated in the code. 

Tony Weber, the chief executive of FCAI, issued a statement saying a 2012 Commonwealth Consumer Affairs Advisory Council (CCAAC) review found there was no evidence of disadvantage to the consumer regarding the sharing of repair information in the industry. 

Andrew McKellar, chief executive of the Australian Automobile Association, says the new code shows little concern for the consumer

The council recommended the auto industry develop a code of practice to ensure there was a process for independent mechanics to access repair information. 

'Now, 23 months later, the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries and the Australian Automotive Dealer Association are the only organisations that appear to be making progress on this matter,' Mr Webber said.

It is compulsory in the United States and Europe for car companies to make available maintenance data to both new car dealership service centres and independent mechanics.
