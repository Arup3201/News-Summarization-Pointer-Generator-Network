Las Vegas Strip is preparing to push out its Sept. 11 memorial - to add an open space modeled after New York's Madison Square Park.

The shrine on the Las Vegas Strip sprung up spontaneously under the ersatz skyline of the New York-New York casino in the days after the terrorist attacks. Rotating collection of first responder T-shirts from across the country, many bearing handwritten notes, have decorated a wrought-iron fence near the faux fireboat below the casinos' 47-seven-story replica of the Empire State Building for more than a decade.

With MGM Resorts International is starting a $100 million renovation of the promenade in front of 16 year-old Manhattan-themed casino and the adjoining Monte Carlo, the memorial will have to go.

MGM says it will relocate the memorial.

"We are working with representatives of the First Responder community in Las Vegas to identify and determine an appropriate and permanent placement of the memorial to the victims of September 11th," MGM spokesman Clark Dumont said in a statement Friday.

The Strip memorial has remained a heartfelt marker amid the plastic artifice of the desert playland.

In 2003, the University of Nevada, Las Vegas began collecting the T-shirts, hats and handwritten notes left at the memorial. It now stores nearly 6,000 of the artifacts in banker boxes at the university library.

Curators rotate the memorabilia through a permanent display case that MGM opened in 2003 at the foot of the resort's 150-foot model Statue of Liberty.

MGM is in the process of transforming the congested sidewalks in front of its New York City and European-themed casinos into an outdoor plaza featuring trees, benches, food trucks and shops. The new promenade is intended to recall Madison Square Park.
