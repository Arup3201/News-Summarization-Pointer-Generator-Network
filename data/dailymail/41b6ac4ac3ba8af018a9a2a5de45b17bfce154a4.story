Footage is set to be released of OJ Simpson as he tried to restart his career with a promotional tour of nightclubs and concerts following his acquittal of his ex-wife Nicole Brown's murder.

The film, called The Unpromotable, is cut from 70 hours of footage taken by his one-time promoter while they toured the U.S. in 2001.

It was put together by Norman Pardo, 51, who took on the task of trying to change the public perception of the former football hero following the sensational trial in 1995.

Simpson walked free after being found not guilty of murdering Brown and her friend Ronald Goldman in Los Angeles in 1994.

Simpson is currently in jail after he was convicted in 2008 of charges including kidnapping and armed robbery following an incident in a Las Vegas casino hotel room with two memorabilia dealers.

The NFL Hall of Famer, 64, was sentenced in December 2008 and faces up to 33 years behind bars.

Talking about his film project, Pardo told the New York Daily News: 'It’s him with girls all over him in clubs. It doesn’t show him in a great light, (but) in both lights. I do show what it’s like to work with him.'

Pardo toured 35 states with Simpson who he said was in complete denial as to how the public viewed him. The promoter added that he was sent death threats after taking on Simpson as a client.

The film will not be released until after the presidential elections in November. Simpson has reportedly ordered that its opening be postponed because the movie has racial undertones and he doesn't want to affect President Obama's chances.

In June 1994, Simpson's ex-wife Nicole was found stabbed multiple times in the head and neck outside her home in Brentwood, Los Angeles. Her friend Ronald Goldman was also fatally stabbed.

In 1995, Simpson was tried on two counts of murder to which he pleaded not guilty.

The trial, for which Simpson had hired a powerful defense team led by Johnnie Cochran, ended with Simpson being found not guilty.

The 'trial of the century' as it was dubbed was watched live on TV by more than half of Americans.

At a later civil trial in 1997, a judgement was awarded against Simpson for the wrongful deaths of Brown and Goldman and he was ordered to pay $33.5 million in damages.
