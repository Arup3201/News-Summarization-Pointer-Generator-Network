Security contractors warned Hillary Clinton's U.S. State Department nearly three months before a deadly 2012 terror attack on its diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya that guards were quitting at an alarming rate, leaving the facility vulnerable to assault.

Judicial Watch, a center-right watchdog group, said Tuesday that it obtained damning emails as part of a Freedom Of Information Act lawsuit against the State Department.

They paint a picture of frantic warnings about armed security personnel not showing up to work and refusing to work night shifts because they were afraid of the Islamist militia that ultimately killed America's ambassador to Libya and three other Americans as they laid waste to the compound.

The documents refer repeatedly to 'emergency shift' workers and show 8-hour windows in overnight security rotations when few if any guards were on patrol.

Mayhem: A terrorist militia linked with al-Qaeda attacked the U.S. State Department's outpost in Benghazi, Libya on Sept. 11, 2012, killing America's ambassador and three other US personnel

Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has caught much of the blame for failing to oversee the Benghazi compound's security needs, and for helping to obscure the terrorist nature of the deadly coordinated assault

Warnings began on June 30, 2012 with a report from Blue Mountain Libya, the contractor tasked with protecting the Benghazi outpost. The company told State Department Contract Specialist Neal Kern security guards were fleeing and leaving the Benghazi Mission vulnerable.

'Due to the amount of local guard force members leaving out of fear of their safety,' the company reported, 'and the long process to security check individuals, it makes it very difficult to quickly react to a large drop in staff in quick succession as has been occurring with all the incidents.'

Chief among those 'incidents' was the June 5 bombing of the compound's outer perimeter wall. 

House Oversight and Government Reform Committee chairman Rep. Darrell Issa, a California Republican, later wrote to then-Secretary Clinton that the attack left a hole described by locals as 'big enough for forty men to go through.'

Blue Mountain's reports to the State Department included a note that six days later a guard 'did not attend' his night shift 'and gave no prior warning of absence.'

'It is believed that the explosive device set off on the compound perimeter wall had a lasting effect on certain members of the staff,' the report said; 'this promoted a fear factor when it came to working the nightshift.'

Three days later the company warned the State Department about 'last minute resignations of ... guard staff' that left the mission's security even weaker.

The newly uncovered documents 'show that the U.S. Special Mission at Benghazi was a sitting duck and that the State Department’s local militia "security" feared for their own safety and wouldn't even show up to provide necessary protection,' Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton said in a statement Wednesday.

'All security indicators were flashing red and, perhaps, with a show of strength to secure the Benghazi mission, U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, Sean Smith, Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods might be alive today.'

Problems with protecting the compound were apparent in reports filed about incidents going back as far as April 2012.

Aftermath: The compound was destroyed and abandoned quickly as American personnel scrambled to evacuate

One of Blue Mountain's guard commanders was fired on April 18 after he got into a fight with a soldier tasked to a Quick Reaction Force in Benghazi. Another guard 'failed to turn up for duty' without warning on April 22.

That left the entire compound in the hands of four men during the perilous hours between midnight and 8:00 a.m. 

Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Victoria Nuland, then the State Department's chief spokesperson, claimed three days after the Sept. 11, 2012 attack that no outside contractors had been hired to provide security for the Benghazi mission.

She was forced to retract that statement a week later, conceding the Blue Mountain Group was contracted to keep the facility and its personnel safe.

Judicial Watch said Wednesday that the Obama administration has not turned over any documents showing the state of security in Benghazi during the last critical weeks before the attack.

The group announced three new federal lawsuits demanding those records, and others that relate to the State Department's role in crafting a false narrative about the attack's causes.

Numerous Obama administration officials, including the president himself, pinned early blame on a clumsily produced online video that lampooned the Muslim prophet Muhammad.

While simultaneous protests in Egypt and elsewhere were in part inspired by outrage over the video, no evidence has emerged to suggest that the militants who attacked in Benghazi were acting as part of a spontaneous mob.

Instead, investigations have consistently shown that the armed assault was a carefully planned and expertly executed military mission, complete with precision mortars that plunged the compound into chaos. 

Mrs. Clinton, now the Democrats' front-runner in the 2016 presidential contest, still faces stern questions from members of Congress and the press about her role in the security failures and the attack's PR-nightmare aftermath.
