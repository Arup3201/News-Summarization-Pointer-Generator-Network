Dana and Elizabeth Davis had spent nearly five gruelling days stranded in their car in the rugged Arizona mountains during a snowstorm when they finally realised they needed to venture out for help.

The car had run out of petrol, and their rations of sandwiches, chocolate bars and juice were depleted.

Dana, 86, bundled in multiple layers of clothing, put socks on his hands for warmth as he and 82-year-old Elizabeth started walking.

What happened next became a story of incredible tragedy and survival. Elizabeth collapsed just 15 to 20 feet into the walk, her body in a weakened state after five days in the cold.

Dana forged ahead, walking eight miles, 
spending a night under a tree and leaving behind pieces of his wife's 
knitting yarn to create a trail to her body.

The former Boy Scout and World War II Navy vet was found by an officer 
with the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation along a desolate, dirt 
road and taken to a hospital, where he spoke with reporters Friday about
the ordeal.

He had lost about weight and was covered with a white blanket, but 
otherwise was in good condition, at the hospital in the mining community
of Globe.

Found: Authorities found the couple's 2001 Buick on a remote road after an Arizona officer found Mr Davis walking alone on a trail

He hopes to be discharged from Cobre Valley Regional Medical Center on Saturday.

The Albuquerque couple had been visiting with nephew Jim Mills in the 
Phoenix suburb of Chandler and began their drive home December 1 along 
U.S. 60 - a route that would take them through the Bosque del Apache 
National Wildlife Refuge near Socorro, where Elizabeth had once been 
president of a friend's group.

The side trip was one of countless journeys they had made in their 60 
years together, visiting Asia, South America and the jungles of Borneo 
to watch orangutans.

But they accidentally ended up on a different highway. Realising their 
mistake, the couple consulted a map and decided to take a forest road 
that connects back to the main road.

Snowed in: The couple was trapped in their stalled car for two separate snowstorms

‘I should have turned around right then and gone about five miles back 
to where I had turned in," Mr Davis said. The couple drove their Buick 
for miles up the forest road, passing a sign that said ‘pavement ends’ 
but continuing on.

Mr Davis said he wasn't worried, because he had driven the Alaska-Canadian Highway before it was paved.

‘So that's the second time I goofed,’ Davis said.

The road became more and more impassable the farther they travelled.

The car bottomed out several times, punching a hole in the transmission oil pan and making it impossible to drive anymore.

They were stuck, miles from anywhere, with no mobile phone and no one knowing of their whereabouts.

They knew they could be there for some time given the desolate nature of
the area. They had two sandwiches, four cookies, two chocolate bars and
two cans of juice.

‘We knew it would probably be a while before somebody found us, so we 
started rationing ourselves right away,’ Mr Davis said at the news 
conference next to his son and daughter, who live in the San Francisco 
and Philadelphia areas.

He was upbeat, but his wife was worried. She wrote letters to her children and grandchildren.

They ran the engine at night to stay warm but eventually ran out of gas and decided to seek help.

Off course: The couple veered off course because they wanted to visit Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge on their way back to Albuquerque

‘She was pretty convinced she was not going to get out of there,’ said 
Davis, who worked 40 years in aerospace engineering for General Electric
Co. and also served in the Navy during World War II. ‘Me, I'm pretty 
stubborn. I was going to walk until I found someone.’

The walk was too much for his wife.

After she collapsed and died, Mr Davis moved her body away from the road and resumed his walk.

He hiked from 10am until sunset Tuesday and found a spot under a tree to spend the night.

The next day, he started walking again in attempt to find any sense of 
civilization. He encountered snow that was piled several feet high along
the road.

Finally, an officer with the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation appeared in an SUV, and he was saved.

His yarn and other markers led them back to his wife of more than 60 years.

Authorities returned the fabric, and Davis displayed it Friday at the 
news conference - a handful of red and blue pieces of yarn that he had 
left on trees to mark the route.

Remote: The couple did not have mobile phones with them, but they likely wouldn't have worked in such a remote location

When asked at the news conference how he is coping, Mr Davis said: "It 
really hasn't hit me that hard yet. ... I don't feel as though I really 
realize she's gone."

The couple's son, Bob Davis, and daughter, Lani Sexton, said the letters their mother wrote are her legacy.

‘The letters to my kids, myself, my sister, her kids. It's almost like 
she knew. She knew that that was it. The letters were very poignant,’ 
son Bob said.

Both children, although devastated by the loss of their mother, beamed at their father.

‘It's amazing, don't you think,’ daughter Lani said. ‘He's 86, and I 
think it bodes well for my brother and I, for our lives. Our family's 
always had humour, and that's what gotten us through the last 36 hours 
since we got to town here, and we're hugely proud.’
