A heartbroken widow yesterday told how a catalogue of NHS errors ‘robbed’ her of the opportunity to say a final goodbye to her dying husband.

Great-grandmother Edna Roberts, 75, was forced to call an ambulance four times before her husband of 50 years, Charles, was finally taken to hospital.

A paramedic from the first ambulance told her to administer aspirin for Mr Roberts’ extreme pain, before a second crew scolded her for dialling 999.

Edna Roberts, 74, was unable to say her last goodbye to her husband Charles after medical staff transferred him to another hospital without informing her

In a ‘final insult’, former soldier Mr
 Roberts, 76 – who was suffering with a number of conditions – was then 
transferred to a second hospital without his wife being told.

The
 blunder meant that when nurses called Mrs Roberts in the middle of the 
night to warn her that her husband’s condition had ‘taken a dip’, she 
took a taxi to the wrong hospital and did not reach his bedside until it
 was too late.

Yesterday Mrs Roberts said: ‘I’m devastated. I didn’t get a chance to say goodbye to Charles.

Mr Roberts, 75, claims she had to call an ambulance four times on the day her husband Charles, 76, died before they agreed take him to hospital

‘I never got to hear his last words. I should have been by his side when he passed, holding his hand as he went.’

She
 said that while they were waiting for the ambulance after the fourth 
999 call she saw Mr Roberts cry ‘for the first time in his life’.

Mrs
 Roberts added: ‘He was never one to make a fuss, I would never have 
called the ambulance in the first place if I didn’t think he was in a 
very bad way.

‘Charles was in so much pain and just wanted it all to 
end. He went with no dignity at all. I’d been by his side every night 
for 50 years and I couldn’t be there for him at the end.’

Mrs Roberts
 called 999 on June 22 after her husband, who had an aortic embolism and
 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, began struggling for breath and 
suffering chest pains.

But during two visits to the couple’s home in 
Redditch, Worcestershire, she says paramedics told her she should only 
call an ambulance in a ‘life or death’ situation and one simply 
suggested Mr Roberts, who served in the Royal Artillery Regiment, take 
two aspirin.

After a third 999 call a doctor was sent out, and he 
diagnosed Mr Roberts with a severe bladder infection and contacted an 
ambulance to take him to hospital.

Around 45 minutes later – after 
Mrs Roberts had called 999 for a fourth time – Mr Roberts was taken to 
the town’s Alexandra Hospital.

She said that at 4am she received a call from a nurse urging her to rush to hospital as her husband’s condition had worsened.

But
 when the pensioner arrived at the Alexandra she was told Mr Roberts, a 
retired factory worker, had been transferred to Worcestershire Royal 
Hospital 17 miles away.

Mrs Roberts, a retired cashier, added: ‘I am utterly disgusted with the hospital, and also with the ambulance staff.’

The couple’s six grown-up children all live in Norfolk. They also have 20 grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren.

Lindsey
 Webb, chief nursing officer from Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS 
Trust, said Mr Roberts’ transfer ‘should have been communicated to Mrs 
Roberts at the first possible opportunity’ and apologised for the 
failure to do so.

Mr Roberts was taken to Redditch's Alexandra Hospital for treatment. The next morning his wife said she received a call telling her that her husband had 'taken a dip' and could she get to the hospital immediately

After getting a taxi to the Alexandra Hospital she was then informed by a member of staff that they did not have a Mr Roberts admitted there. The staff member then returned to say her husband of 50 years had been transferred to Worcester Royal Hospital - 17 miles away

A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman said: 
‘On June 22, three calls were received in regard to a pre-existing 
medical condition. The first ambulance arrived at 9.30am where the staff
 found the patient in a stable condition and arranged for a GP to assess
 him.

A GP visited Mr Roberts and asked for Mr Roberts to be taken to 
hospital once again. This was not an emergency case.

‘The trust is saddened to hear the comments of Mrs Roberts and would urgently like to speak to her to find out more.’
