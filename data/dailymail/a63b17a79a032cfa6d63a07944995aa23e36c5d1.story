Team news

Newcastle

John Carver is hoping for a series of fitness boosts as he continues in the role of caretaker Newcastle boss.

Midfielders Mehdi Abeid (foot), Siem de Jong and Gabriel Obertan (both thigh) and Rolando Aarons (hamstring) are all on the comeback trail, although none are expected to make the squad for Saturday's Barclays Premier League clash with Southampton.

Jonas Gutierrez's continues his battle for fitness after recovering from testicular cancer, while goalkeepers Rob Elliot (thigh) and Jak Alnwick (shoulder), defender Steven Taylor (Achilles), utility man Ryan Taylor (knee) and striker Adam Armstrong (foot) are still out, while Cheick Tiote and Papiss Cisse are away on African Nations Cup duty.

Provisional squad: Krul, Woodman, Janmaat, Dummett, Santon, Williamson, Coloccini, Streete, Haidara, Satka, Anita, Sissoko, Cabella, Colback, Gouffran, Ameobi, Vuckic, Riviere, Perez.

Southampton 

Victor Wanyama, Morgan Schneiderlin and Toby Alderweireld are amongst those missing when Southampton return to Premier League action at Newcastle.

Wanyama will miss up to five weeks with a hamstring injury sustained in Wednesday's FA Cup third-round replay at Ipswich - a match fellow defensive midfielder Schneiderlin missed with an adductor strain, which also rules him out of the St James' Park trip.

Alderweireld is sidelined with a hamstring strain, seeing him join Sam Gallagher and Jay Rodriguez in the treatment room, while Maya Yoshida, Sadio Mane and Emmanuel Mayuka have international commitments.

Provisional squad: Forster, K Davis, Gazzaniga, Clyne, Bertrand, Targett, Gardos, Fonte, McCarthy, S Davis, Ward-Prowse, Cork, Hesketh, Tadic, Reed, Isgrove, Elia, Seager, Long, Pelle.
