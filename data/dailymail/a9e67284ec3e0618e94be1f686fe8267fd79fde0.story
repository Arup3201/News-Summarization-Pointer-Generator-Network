A man is in police custody after he arrived at his lawyer's Fort Myers office claiming he had killed a man in self defense and that the man's body was outside in his pickup truck.

John Marshall, told his lawyer that a neighbor had approached him with a gun and that he had fatally shot the unnamed man in a scuffle earlier on Wednesday afternoon, said Robert Harris, Marshall's attorney and owner of the Harris Law Firm.

Marshall, 52, had a swollen lip, a freshly missing tooth, another tooth that is chipped and what looked like two broken thumbs, Harris said.

Marshall's green pickup sat for much of Wednesday afternoon at the back of Marshall's law firm with crime scene tape around it and a dead body in the back

He told Naples Daily News that Marshall looked 'like he'd been in a fight for his life.'

Marshall told Harris he'd been at one of his properties in Bokeelia when his neighbor had come at him with a gun.

Marshall said his neighbor pistol-whipped him, knocking out a tooth, and said the two ended up in a wrestling match on the ground, each man squirming for the gun.

After killing his neighbor Marshall said he brought the man to the attorney's office because he didn't know who else to trust.

Harris called 911 shortly after his client arrived at the law firm about 4 p.m. Harris said the man was cooperating with authorities.

The two men had been in some sort of dispute over property work in Bokeelia, Florida, Harris told News-Press.com.

Robert Harris' law firm is located in downtown Fort Myers. Harris told reports that the incident involving Marshall was the 'cleanest-cut case of self defense I've ever seen'

A few days ago, Marshall came to the law firm looking for advice about his neighbor, whom he considered a threat.

Marshall said he was doing some construction around his property that the two had argued about. Marshall had plans to file for a restraining order, according to Harris.

'It's the cleanest-cut case of self defense I've ever seen,' Harris said.

Detectives from the major crimes unit are conducting a death investigation, according to the Sheriff's Office statement. No other people are believed to have witnessed the fight.

Harris is also representing Marshall in a felony case for aggravated battery with a deadly weapon from September.
