Getting the sack is never pleasant – unless the sack contains a £200,000 cash bonus and you’ve not actually been fired.

In scenes reminiscent of Wolf Of Wall Street, one firm in China – a nation that’s still officially communist – dished out massive cash bonuses to its managers during a bonus payday party.

It showed the vast gulf that is starting to exist between the country's rich and poor.

This bizarre bonus payday included uniformed hostesses to hand out the armfuls of cash to the managers at the land development firm, and the staff themselves were dancing across the stage as their names were called, and they were handed their bonus.

The event at the county of Zhecheng in Henan province in central China was against a backdrop of allegations that in many cases people are forced off their land to make way for new developments often without proper compensation.

Examples of nail households - people that remain in their homes as the construction goes on around them - are omnipresent not just in China but worldwide.

One, Lu Hin, who refused to budge from his flat in a five-story housing block in the city of Xian in Shaanxi province in the west of China had the property demolished over his head. He said he would not move until he was paid enough to get a new place and added: ‘This shows the sort of thing these people are up to, lining their own pockets at our expense.’

The land developing company in Zhecheng county in central China’s Henan province paid out a total of £1.1million in bonuses, with the biggest earner getting £200,000 alone, and needing to take it away in a sack.
