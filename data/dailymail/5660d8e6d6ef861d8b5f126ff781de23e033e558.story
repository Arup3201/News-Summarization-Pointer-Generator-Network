All parents have had that feeling of dread when their kids ask them something they just don't know how to answer. 'Where do babies come from?' being a particularly common query that parents find hard to tackle.

However, research shows that a worrying amount of children are becoming too scared to ask the awkward questions that they need to discuss with their parents.

A survey revealed today that more than one in four children (27 per cent) have admitted to keeping problems and worries to themselves because they don't know how to tell their parents.

Presenter Cherry Healey, shared her daughter's uncomfortable question for the Railway Children project

The survey conducted by the charity Railway Children, partners with Aviva shows that many parents are unaware of the problem with 95 per cent believing that they are very approachable when it comes to tackling difficult subjects.

However research contradicted this, revealing that many parents aren't broaching subjects such as family changes, divorce and death with their children.

Out of 500 parents surveyed a quarter of parents (24 per cent) said that they hadn’t talked about family changes with their children, while one in five (22 per cent) hadn’t approached difficult subjects like death or suicide.

Nearly a third (31 per cent) admitted that they would only deal with a difficult conversation with their child if the issue arises.

This comes as a concern as research shows that children who experience disruption such as divorce, are three times more likely to run away from home, highlighting the importance of discussing tricky subjects with children.

Andy McCullough, Head of UK Policy & Public Affairs at Railway Children, which supports vulnerable young people alone and at risk on Britain’s streets says that this is not uncommon problem.

'Every five minutes a child runs away from home in the UK. That's 100,000 children under 16 every year. These children run away for a variety of reasons such as problems experienced at school, relationship issues or family breakdown.'

Awkward: In their promotional video Railway Children and Aviva document some of the more embarrassing questions parents get asked

Cringe: The campaign encourages parents to have an open dialogue with their children no matter how awkward their questions may be

Ermmmm...Although questions may be difficult to answer Railway Child say that having open conversations now will help children approach their parents with more serious problems when they're older

Andy continues to emphasise the importance of proactively discussing issues with young children in order to avoid such problems.

'Not having someone to talk to about these problems can result in feelings of desperation and helplessness for a child, which could lead them to think about running away from home.

'For any parent, discovering that your child has run away from home is the worst possible nightmare. But talking to your child and having open conversations, regardless of how awkward they might be, may be all it takes to prevent them from considering running away from home.'

The survey
 also highlighted that two in five children (40 per cent) reported an 
overwhelming sense of loneliness and isolation when they don’t have 
anyone to talk to.

The
 issues that 11-16 year olds are finding most difficult to discuss with 
their parents include sex (36 per cent), romantic relationships (30 per 
cent) and body image (19 per cent), with a quarter of children saying 
that their parents have never tried to bring up these issues at all.

Serious side: The video also highlights that children do have worries and doubts that need to be discussed with their parents

Concerning: Research shows that many kids turn to the Internet for answers because they feel like they can't talk to their parents

With no one else to turn to many of these children are relying on modern technology to help them rather than their own family with one in five (21 per cent) turning to the Internet for answers.

Psychiatrist Dr Sandra Scott says that having open discussions is vital in children's development.

'Every parent will know that having awkward conversations is a necessary part of parenting. But establishing an open and honest pattern of communication between parents and children from a young age is incredibly important.

'For parents, maintaining this for the future when their children grow older and face different, and more difficult, challenges, lets them know they always have someone to confide in.'

'Talking to your child and having open 
conversations, regardless of how awkward they might be, may be all it 
takes to prevent them from considering running away from home'

The charity Railway are asking parents to upload their most awkward parenting conversation at www.avivaconversations.co.uk to help raise awareness of the importance of an honest, open dialogue and pledge to continue tackling tricky subjects.

For every conversation included in the Awkward Conversations hub and/or any share directly from the hub, Aviva will donate £2 to Railway Children, up to a maximum of £100,000 or until the campaign closes on 25 August.

Heather Smith, Marketing Director of General Insurance at Aviva believes that communication between parent and child is a necessity when it comes to tackling homelessness in children.

'100,000 children run away from home in the UK each year and the true extent and scale of the problem is hidden and more can, and should, be done to address this.

'Through our work with Railway Children, we know that tackling tough conversations is vital to ensure children don’t become isolated and feel that running away is their only option. We are proud to be working closely with Railway Children and the money raised will provide much needed funding to support their continued work in the UK, helping vulnerable young people alone and at risk on Britain’s streets.'
