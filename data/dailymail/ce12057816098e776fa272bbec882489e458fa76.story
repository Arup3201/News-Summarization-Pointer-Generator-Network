These incredible pictures show the ancient art of falconry as it is still practiced in the harsh mountainous region that straddles the border between Russia, China and Kazakhstan.

The traditional hunting method is a prominent part of the culture in the autonomous Xinjiang Uygur region, where falconers gather every year to compete in a place known as the 'Village of the Falcon'.

As a means to preserve the skill for future generations, the local government has also begun issuing monthly salaries of 300 - 500 yuan to falcon masters to encourage them to pass down their skills.

Since November 2010, falconry - which is predominately practiced by the Uygur, Kazak and Kirgiz ethnic groups - has been listed by UNESCO as an intangible cultural heritage of humanity.

The training and handling of the large birds of prey follows a strict set of ancient rules that local eagle hunters are attempting to preserve.

The tradition of hunting with the huge eagles is said to have been started by the nomadic Khitans from Manchuria in northern China around 940AD.

The eagles soar through the air at speeds of up to 200mph as they race to reach their keeper first, during annual festivals. Their hunting prowess is also tested as they chase meat pulled along by the horses.

Other activities held during the competition include horse racing, archery and Bushkashi, which is a goatskin tug of war on horseback.

It also sees awards handed out for Best Turned Out Eagle And Owner, Best Eagle At Hunting Prey and Best Eagle At Locating Its Owner From A Distance.

The hunters wear traditional costumes, complete with fur coats made of marmot, fox or wolf skins which have been caught by their eagles. The more extravagant the coat the more respected the hunter is.

Trained eagles, such as those pictured, are able to catch dozens of pheasants a day which their keepers can then sell at local markets
