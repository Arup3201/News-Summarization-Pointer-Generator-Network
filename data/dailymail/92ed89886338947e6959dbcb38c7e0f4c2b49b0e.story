Palmer United's Jacqui Lambie wants members of radical Islamic groups to be stripped of their right to vote and deported in a bid to combat home-grown terrorists.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott is 'turning a blind eye' to the real threat of terrorists in our own backyard, as he sends our troops to fight them overseas, Senator Lambie says.

If Islamic leaders who preach violence and allegiance to anti-democratic foreign powers are not allowed to stand for the Australian parliament, the next step should be introducing laws that mean such leaders are stripped of their citizenship and their right to vote, she said.

'(How many of them) enjoy Australian social services payments, entitlements and democratic freedoms?' Senator Lambie said.

'If you're going to carry on with that sort of rot, the first thing we should ensure is that they don't receive any government funds or entitlements, don't have the right to vote and are deported.'

'Our taxes should be exclusively reserved for people who love Australia with no formal or informal allegiances to foreign religious leaders and anti-democratic laws, she said. 

Lambie is also running a campaign to 'ban the burqa.'

Last month, Lambie made the following statements in the wake of the nation wide terror raids.

'Now we're at war with the sharia extremists and Australia has been placed on a heightened terrorism alert - we can't have anyone hiding their identity in public. It now becomes an important national security issue,' Lambie said.

'I call for an immediate and complete ban on the wearing of burkas in public.

'The burkas are obviously designed by men who have an obsessive need to have extreme control and power over women.

'Why have the feminists turned a blind eye to this and other abhorrent cultural practices happening in Australia like female genital mutilation?'

Last month, she shared an image on her Facebook of Malalai Kaka, an Afghanistan's policewoman who the Taliban murdered in her car in 2008. 

The image featured the words 'For security reasons it's now time to ban the burqa.' 

Lambie went under intense fire for the post, and was accused of being ignorant by opposition leader Bill Shorten.

Earlier this month, Lambie went head-to-head with Maha Abdo from the Muslim Women's Association on Channel Seven's morning show Sunrise. 

During the debate, she told Abdo, 'You have beautiful faces and it would be nice to be able see them.'
