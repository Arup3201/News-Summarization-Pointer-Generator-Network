The boyfriend of a woman who died after a two year battle with cancer stole more than £3,000 she left for her five-year-old daughter.

Mark Hibberd also took over £1,200 raised through charity events for the daughter of his 'soulmate' Suzanne Clarkson, who died aged just 30.

Hibberd, 46, started a relationship with Suzanne in 2008 but she was diagnosed with breast cancer soon after and died in July 2010, Leeds Crown Court heard.

Thief: Mark Hibberd who stole more than £3,000 from the estate of his late girlfriend Suzanne Clarkson. He also took over £1,200 raised through charity events for her daughter, five

He claimed he regarded her as his ‘soulmate’.

But the court heard he took money she inherited and transferred it to his own bank account.

His partner's family also asked Hibberd to safeguard money raised for her daughter through a series of community fundraisers but he also took some of that.

Hibberd, of Hemsworth, West Yorkshire, admitted two counts of theft and was jailed for eight months, suspended for a year, at Leeds Crown Court.

Mitigating, Dan Smith said: 'He is deeply ashamed and wants to put things right. He is genuinely sorry.'

Hibberd was also ordered to complete 200 hours community work.

Judge Tom Bayliss QC told him: 'You suffered a bereavement in 2010 of someone described as your soulmate.

'And what you did for your soulmate was to steal the money she had destined for her five-year-old daughter.

'To compound matters, you stole money people in the community had put a lot of time in to raising for that same daughter.'

After the case Suzanne’s mother Lorraine Clarkson, 60, of Hemsworth, said: 'We don’t care what happens to him.

Hibberd claimed he regarded her as his 'soulmate'. But the court heard he took money she inherited and transferred it to his own bank account

'It was never about prison it was just about getting the money back that is owed to our granddaughter.'

She added that her daughter had suffered from cancer previously and was in remission when it returned.

She said: 'When she first had cancer doctors said she would make a full recovery. She finished treatment and had reconstruction surgery but then she got poorly again.

'She kept it from us for a couple of months because her dad was ill in hospital. She was worried about him and I don’t think she wanted to tell us that she was getting ill again.

'Suzanne was a popular, well-liked young woman. She was always bubbly and she really cared about the people around her.'
