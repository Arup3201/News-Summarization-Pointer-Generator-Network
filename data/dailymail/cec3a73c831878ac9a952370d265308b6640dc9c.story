David Cameron’s official adviser on parenting and childhood  yesterday became the latest of two dozen new Tory MPs whose marriages have failed since the 2010 election.

Claire Perry announced she is splitting from her husband after 17 years.

The MP for Devizes said her marriage  had become ‘increasingly difficult’ but denied anyone else was involved.

Devizes MP Claire Perry, who was only elected to the Commons in 2010, has revealed her 17-year marriage marriage to husband Clayton, right, is over

A mother of three, she is the latest 
of more than 20 Conservative MPs from the 2010 intake whose long-term 
relationships have broken down.

When he came to power, Mr Cameron vowed that his would be the ‘most familyfriendly government we’ve ever had in this country’.

He promised more help for the influx of young parents to Parliament in 2010.

Mr and Mrs Perry have a son and two daughters

MPs recently voted to cut the days they were expected to stay in Parliament until late at night from two to one a week.

However when Louise Mensch quit 
Parliament last year, she cited needing more time for her family.

An 
astonishing one in six of the newer Conservative MPs has suffered 
marriage breakdowns or separations, according to unofficial research by 
MP Charles Walker.

Ambitious Mrs Perry, 48, blamed the 
‘demanding jobs’ held by her and her New Zealand-born husband Clayton 
Perry, a City fund manager.

She made an announcement to her local 
newspaper in Wiltshire, the Devizes Gazette and Herald, saying: ‘It is 
completely amicable.

‘This is not the War of the Roses. 
There has been wild speculation that one or other of us is involved with
someone else, but I can assure you that is not the case.’

She added: ‘Our marriage has become increasingly difficult for several years.

‘It’s nobody’s fault, no one has behaved badly, we have just grown apart.

‘We both have extremely demanding jobs
and for some time we have been going our separate ways. But we still 
live under the same roof in Wiltshire and in London.’

Last year David Cameron appointed Mrs Perry has his advisor on childhood and sexualisation of children

Despite only being elected three years ago, Mrs Perry has built a high profile in Westminster as an outspoken campaigner on internet porn and raising children

The Oxford-educated banker met her 
husband in New York in 1994 when they were in the finance industry and 
married there before settling in Britain.

They live in a six-bedroom £3million mansion near Salisbury which dates back to the 16th century.

Their children, aged 16 to ten, are 
all at boarding schools. Mrs Perry said: ‘Just because you break up with
someone, you don’t stop loving them.

‘It’s hard on the children. They all know the situation and they are very sad about it.

‘Most children want mum and dad to be together, but it is just not possible.’

Mrs Perry, who worked for Chancellor 
George Osborne before becoming an MP three years ago, is a parliamentary
aide to Defence Secretary Philip Hammond.

She has won admiration for campaigning
to try to force internet service providers to automatically block 
pornography unless an adult asks for it to be available.

Last weekend, Charles Walker, the Tory
MP for Broxbourne in Hertfordshire, said 23 of the 147 newly-elected in
2010 had been divorced, formally separated or had long-term 
relationships break down since the election.
