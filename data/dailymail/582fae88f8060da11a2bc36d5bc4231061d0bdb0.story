Broadchurch's final twist left some fans of the murder mystery disappointed last night as stars David Tennant and Olivia Colman confirmed they will return for a third series.

As the second series of the Dorset-based whodunnit drew to a close last night, viewers were torn between praising the show's actors, and expressing their disbelief at the final scenes.

And while some viewers were excited to learn at the end of the episode that the show will return, others took to Twitter to complain they had seen enough.

Broadchurch stars David Tennant and Olivia Colman have confirmed they will return for series three, but some fans of the murder mystery have expressed their disappointment with the way the second series ended

Last week, fans had been left in suspense with the jury about to declare Joe Miller guilty, or not guilty of murdering Danny Latimer, and wondering if the identity of the Sandbrook killer, or killers, would ever be revealed.

And while last night's episode saw many of the show's plot-lines tied up, not all reached the conclusions viewers might have hoped for.

Tennant's DI Alec Hardy and Colman's DS Ellie Miller were reconciled, and mystery surrounding the fate of the Sandbrook cousins finally unfolded - but Joe walked free, only to be banished to Sheffield and told he would never see his children again. 

Last night's viewing figure peaked at 8.26 million, with an average of 7.85 million and a 33.7 per cent audience share.

Viewer Sophie H was not excited to learn that a third series of Broadchurch is in the works

Ex-Radio One DJ Chris Moyles admitted he had been frustrated by the show, but described it as 'brilliant'

Lorraine Kelly praised the drama, and put forward her thoughts on the next series

The final instalment was down on the first series, which peaked at 9.3 million viewers in its last outing, but did boast the highest rating episode of the series - far more than the 5.8million who tuned in last week and the initial 7.6million who watched the first episode of the second series.

Viewers' responses, as they had been for much of the series where the murder mystery was transformed into a courtroom drama were mixed, with not all welcoming news of further episodes.

And viewer Sophie H wrote on the social network: 'They are all dead, imprisoned or having a picnic on the beach. No series 3. No cliffhangers. No cliffs. Just NO. Spare my soul. #Broadchurch'.

Another Twitter user, IncrediblyRich wrote: 'WELL THANK GOD THAT'S OVER AND DONE WITH. *closes #Broadchurch file and throws it down a deep ravine never to be seen again*'.

Rosie Goldsmith took to Twitter to describe the final episode and 'weak, amoral and disappointing'

And some Sheffield-based viewers were angry that  Joe's exile to the Yorkshire city was seen as a fitting punishment.

Deputy council leader Harry Harpham said: 'It's a fantastic drama but that part did make me sit up and take notice."

The Labour councillor added: 'I have thoroughly enjoyed both series but I would not like child murderers to be sent up to Sheffield. That is not the image I want the rest of the country to think of Sheffield.

'This is the best city in Britain by a country mile.' 

Another councillor Roger Davison, said: 'It came as a bit of a surprise and it's a little insulting to Sheffield.

'I don't think anybody wants a load of criminals in their city.'

His wife Catherine Davison also watched the show and said: 'They probably think Sheffield is an exotic place and a long way away from Dorset.

'Sheffield is like a big village, everyone knows each other and is very low on crime."

She added: 'Broadchurch was a very complicated show but I will watch anything with David Tennant in.'

Twitter user Charles Hartley was thought Joe being exiled to Sheffield did not fit his crime

While the first series had much of the nation gripped, eager to discover who had killed Danny Latimer, many fans were not as taken with the show's second outing

But those who praised the show included former Radio One DJ Chris Moyles, who wrote: 'It's kept me riveted and made me angry, frustrated, emotional etc but overall, Broadchurch has been brilliant television.'

And after expressing her initial shock at Joe's acquittal, Lorraine Kelly added: 'That was a very good piece of drama. Big congrats to all concerned. #Broadchurch - will there be a spin off with the lawyers???'

The murder mystery, which came to the end of its second season last night, attracted an average audience of more than nine million viewers across the two series, including those who watched via catch-up services.

No details about the other cast members who will be joining DI Hardy and DS Miller have been revealed and filming dates will be confirmed at a later date, broadcaster ITV said. 

Creator and writer Chris Chibnall said: 'We've been overwhelmed that nine million people every week have continued to join us on the twists and turns of Broadchurch. This third chapter has been a glint in my eye for a long time and I'm thrilled to be writing these characters once again.'

ITV's director of drama Steve November said: 'Chris Chibnall knows exactly how to keep viewers guessing and I'm delighted that he is going to take the story on to the next stage.' 

While last night's episode saw many of the show's plot-lines tied up, not all came to the conclusions viewers might have hoped for

While the first series had much of the nation gripped, eager to discover who had killed Danny Latimer, many fans were not as taken with the show's second outing.

Throughout the series viewers had complained that the court scenes were inaccurate, with some on Twitter even labelling the series 'Boredchurch'. 

Fans had also expressed their disbelief at some scenes, including last week's kiss between two middle-aged women many had mistaken for sisters, and characters getting table service at chicken restaurant chain Nando's.

Two weeks ago, viewers were shocked to see a 'Fifty Shades of Grey' scene in which Lee Ashworth is seen 'strangling' his wife Claire as the pair engaged in a sexual encounter in the ruins of a clifftop barn.

Fans also complained that they were finding it harder to understand David Tennant - because his accent has become 'more Scottish'.

The actor, who plays dour Detective Inspector Alec Hardy, received widespread praise for his performance in the first series of the acclaimed show.

But a number of viewers  complained that they found it increasingly difficult to understand his accent as the second series got underway.

Elsewhere, mother Beth Latimer, played by Jodie Whittaker, prompted ridicule when she returned to court to witness the trial of Joe Miller a short time after an easy water birth. 

The criticism led to Tennant to jump to the show's defence, saying the second series of the show is a victim of its own success.

He said: 'I think we're a victim of our success to be honest. The first series was such an extraordinary thing. This country, we never allow lightning to strike twice in this country...we just don't let that happen.

'So, inevitably there was going to be a certain amount of "it's not as good as the first time".

'I think it is. I think it's a wonderful series that I'm very proud to be part of.'

The US version of the murder-mystery, also starring Tennant, has not being renewed for a second series, according to reports. 

Viewers were left baffled when lawyer Jocelyn Knight and newspaper editor Maggie Radcliffe shared a romantic kiss during a cliff-top picnic - despite many thinking they were related
