He died last year but now will live forever in hearts and minds after Berlin unveiled a statue to the world's most famous bear on Wednesday.

Knut was just four when he toppled into his pool and died from a brain disorder on March 19 last year.

He had achieved global celebrity before his death - first by being rejected by his mother, then being raised by hand and finally becoming addicted to celebrity.

Memorial: A monument to polar bear Knut was today unveiled at the Zoo in Berlin, Germany

He earned the zoo millions during his short life and this week the statue funded by fans from across the world and the statue called 'Knut the Dreamer' was unveiled at Berlin Zoo not far from where he captivated 11 million visitors during his short life.

Created by Nuremberg artist Josef Tabachnyk, it depicts him lying on a rock.

'Knut will stay in the hearts of many visitors, this memorial will create something for future generations so that the unique nature of this animal celebrity will live on,' said the Friends of the Capital Zoos association.

At the peak of his fame Knut even appeared on the front page of Vanity Fair magazine.

But the dark side of celebrity meant that he literally became hooked on stardom, only becoming animated when the cameras clicked and the audience cooed.

Animal welfare specialists went so far as to dub him a 'psycho bear' who was driven mad by his own fame.

The statue of him is of a more innocent time, when he was still young and adored.

'The most popular animal in the history of our zoo had left traces of love behind,' said the zooâ€™s commercial director Gabriele Thoene.

'Some may have disapproved of making the bear into a celebrity, but they too couldn't escape the magic of the moment.'
