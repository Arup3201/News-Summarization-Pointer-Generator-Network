Rihanna and Chris Brown are doing little to discourage rumours of a reconciliation.

The two pop superstars partied at the same club at the same time for the second time in as many days, leaving within minutes of each other.

Quick step: Rihanna seen leaving club Avenue in New York... minutes after her ex-boyfriend Chris Brown

Video has emerged of Chris and Rihanna leaving Avenue nightclub in New York.

TMZ reported the pair 
were in the club together for around 30 minutes and Brown spent some 
time with the Rude Girl singer at her table.

The way they were: Rihanna and Chris were a star couple, until he was charged with assaulting her in 2009

Sitting
in different booths, the couple still 'kept a close eye on each other' -
and Brown sent her over two bottles of Ace of Spades Champagne.

A video surfaced today of the pair leaving the club minutes apart.

The lovelorn pair have been linked 
together several times already this year, after it emerged that they had
recorded songs with each.

And of late wherever Rihanna is, 
Brown isn't far behind, as they party at birthday celebrations and 
nightclubs in West Hollywood.

The sighting comes after another sign
that Rihanna is paving the way for a reconciliation with singer Chris ,
as the raunchy singer reportedly invited the singer to attend a 
basketball game party on Saturday with her family.

The singer and Brown joined her family - including grandfather Lionel Braithwaite on Saturday at an intimate gathering at Jay-Z's New York club 40/40 to watch the Miami Heat beat the Boston Celtics.

A source told The New York Post: 'Rihanna arrives first in a yellow cab, with her family and friends, and was escorted to a private room.

'Brown arrived a little later and joined her and her family.'

The pair have been spotted together often in recent weeks.

On Saturday night, however, it seemed the two were more than just friends.

They were allegedly sitting together 
on the same couch, rooting for the Heat.

Brown's girlfriend, model 
Karrueche Tran, was not there.

Asked about reconciliation rumours, a rep for Brown told the MailOnline: 'Chris is very happy in his relationship with his girlfriend, Karrueche Tran.'

Meanwhile, sources told The Post Rihanna’s management is calling the rekindled friendship the 'Chris Brown issue.'

'Everyone in the business assumes she and Chris are getting back together, and it is only a matter of time before they’ll be more public about it,' the source told the newspaper.

'It’s
like she is testing the water — first they work on music together, then
they hang out in a friendly way, so the public won’t be completely 
shocked when they step out together publicly.'

Brown infamously left the Barbadian pop singer bruised and bloodied after assaulting her ahead of the Grammys in 2009.

There is also a tug of war at Roc Nation over the final say on what she is doing.

'But everyone agrees they can’t control Rihanna and can’t stop her seeing Chris, no matter how much they fear the negative public reaction will be.

'It means she probably won’t release another album this year, for fear of a backlash.'
