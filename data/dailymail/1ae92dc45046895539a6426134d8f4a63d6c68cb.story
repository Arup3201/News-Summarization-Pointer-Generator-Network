A primary school which banned pupils from using Black Country slang to halt a ‘decline in standards’ has revealed the controversial policy seems to have improved children's reading and writing.

Parents were furious when school chiefs ordered children to stop speaking  the dialect, saying it should be preserved to protect the local identity.

Staff at Colley Lane Primary School, Halesowen, West Midlands, drew up a list of ten outlawed phrases such as 'I cor do that' instead of 'I can't do that,' and 'It wor me'.

Parents including Alana Willetts with her son George, nine, were angry with the ban on Black Country dialect, but grades in reading and writing have improved 

It has emerged that the ban has been a success in the classroom, with pupils achieving higher grades in reading and writing.

The number of children gaining Key Stage 2 reading had improved by seven per cent with 79 per cent of pupils gaining level four.

Children achieving the higher level five grade in reading has also gone up nine per cent to 41 per cent.

Headteacher John White said: 'Our intention was not to remove any local culture or identity but to give our children the spoken language skills to compete against the best.

The letter sent out to parents last year gave a list of outlawed phrases,  such as 'I cor do that' instead of 'I can't do that,' and 'It wor me'

'It would be great to see a more positive view on what we are trying to achieve here.'

Last year Mr White enraged parents when he told them about the Black Country ban.

Here are the phrases pupils at Colley Lane Primary School, in Halesowen, have been banned from using:

1. 'They was' instead of 'they were.'

2. 'I cor do that' instead of 'I can't do that.'

3. 'Ya' instead of 'you.'

4. 'Gonna' instead of 'going to.'

5. 'Woz' instead of 'was.'

6. 'I day' instead of 'I didn't.'

7. 'I ain't' instead of 'I haven't.'

8. 'Somefink' instead of 'something.'

9. 'It wor me' instead of 'it wasn't me.'

10. 'Ay?' instead of 'pardon?'

In a letter to parents, he said: 'Recently we asked each class teacher to write a list of the top ten most damaging phrases used by children in the classroom.

'We are introducing a 'zero tolerance' in the classroom to get children out of the habit of using the phrases on the list.

'We want the children in our school to have the best start possible: Understanding when it is and is not acceptable to use slang and colloquial language.

'We value the local dialect but are encouraging children to learn the skill of turning it on and off in different situations.'

The Black Country includes Dudley, Sandwell, Walsall, and southern parts of Wolverhampton.

Other words and phrases on the prohibited list include 'ay', meaning 'pardon', and 'I day', meaning 'I didn't'.

Alana Willetts, 30, whose nine-year-old son George goes to the school, said staff should be teaching pupils about the Black Country and its dialect.

'Some of my friends have gone on to be doctors and lawyers and I'm an engineer – [the accent] doesn't affect you as a person,' she said.

'I think it is patronising and insulting to say that people with a Black Country accent are disadvantaged. All the parents are outraged.'  

But Zheyan Kareem, 31, who moved to the UK eight years ago and whose seven-year-old son is a pupil, supported the ban, saying: ‘English is my second language. So for me … it is good if my child speaks English in the house and not slang picked up at school.’

The primary school, which has 592 children aged four to 11 and was judged ‘good’ at its last Ofsted inspection.

The distinctive Black Country dialect of the 'Yam Yams' is spoken in towns like Wolverhampton, Sandwell, Tipton and Dudley, and can be very confusing to outsiders.

Scholars find it fascinating because it has preserved grammar from Early Modern English and even Middle English.'Thee', 'Thy' and 'Thou' are still in use, as is the case in parts of Yorkshire and Lancashire. 

'Ow B'ist', meaning 'How beist thou?' is a common greeting, with the typical answer being 'Bay too bah', meaning 'I bayn't be too bad'.'I haven't seen her' becomes 'I ay sid 'er'. 

Black Country dialect often substitutes the word 'ar' for 'yes'.Several word pronunciations are also different: 'you' is pronounced 'yow' (pronounced yo with a silent w), whereas 'go', which is often pronounced 'goo' or 'gooin'' for 'going', is more in line with pronunciations in the Midlands.

The heritage of the West Midlands is brought to life at the Black Country Living Museum and locals are keen to retain their distinctive dialect 

It is also quite common for broad Black Country speakers to say 'agooin' instead of 'going'.

Inhabitants are proud to be known as Black Country 'folk' and resist hints at any relationship to people living in Birmingham, calling Birmingham 'Brum-a-jum' (Birmingham's colloquial name is 'Brummagem', a corruption of its older name of 'Bromwicham' and hence West Bromwich) or 'Birminam' (missing the g and h out and saying it the way it's spelt).

Residents of Birmingham ('Brummies') meanwhile often refer to their Black Country neighbours as 'Yam Yams', a reference to the use of 'Yow am' (or yow'm ) instead of 'You are', and not because they say 'I yam' instead of 'I am'.Dudley residents often refer to the people of Birmingham as 'Dummy Brummies'. 

Also, the town of Walsall can be pronounced either 'War-sall' or 'Wor-sull', with a strong Walsall accent considered to be typical 'yam-yam'.

The strong Black Country dialect is less commonly heard today than in the past. However, a stronger variation of the dialect (than the one frequently used) appears to be heard quite often in conversations between older Black Country folk.

The word endings with 'en' are still noticeable in conversation as in 'gooen' (going), 'callen' (calling) and the vowel 'A' is pronounced as 'O' as in 'sond' (sand), 'hond' (hand) and 'mon' (man). 

Other pronunciations are 'winder' for window, 'fer' for 'far', and 'loff' for 'laugh' exactly as Chaucer's English was spoken.

Local dialect was (and probably still is to a lesser degree) quite distinctive between the different towns and villages of the Black Country. Although most outsiders to the Black Country can't tell this difference, Black Country folk can quiet fiercely defend the difference between the accent.
