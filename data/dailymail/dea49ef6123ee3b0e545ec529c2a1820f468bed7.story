Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers has joked he would have special instructions for his defenders if his side were to meet Luis Suarez's Barcelona in this season's Champions League.

The Reds could meet La Liga giants Barcelona in the prestigious European competition after Suarez helped Liverpool secure a spot in the Champions League.

And Rodgers, who is currently gearing up for the new Premier League campaign along with his Liverpool's first team stars in America, has revealed he would tell his defenders to avoid getting nutmegged by the tricky forward.

Tactical plan: Brendan Rodgers is wary of the threat Luis Suarez could cause if Liverpool played Barcelona

When asked by American reporters how he would feel if Liverpool came up against Suarez's Barcelona in the Champions League, Rodgers replied: 'It would be very interesting.

'It would be a wonderful game. They are two clubs who are giants in the world game.

'I would probably have to tell my defenders to keep their legs closed.'

Liverpool stepped up their preparations for the new season on Wednesday night by beating Premier League rivals Manchester City on penalties in the International Champions Cup.
