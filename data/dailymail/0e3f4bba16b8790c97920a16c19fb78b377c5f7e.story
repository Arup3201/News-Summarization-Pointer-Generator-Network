Steven Gerrard looked far from impressed as the England captain took a closer look at the pitch his team will be playing on for their World Cup opener against Italy on Saturday.

Roy Hodgson accompanied Gerrard onto the Arena Amazonia pitch to inspect the turf which has attracted controversy earlier this week for being more paint than grass.

Seeing past the pitch problem, Gerrard believes England are ready for their first World Cup test against the Azzurri.

He said: 'We’re a better team and a better squad, confident is higher, preparation has gone well and we’re growing as a team, trying to improve. We know we’ll be judged on the games coming up.

'Hopefully we can prove to everyone we have improved as a team.

'I do feel we’re ready. We’re very focused, can’t wait to get started. We’ve got one short session to go and then looked forward to match day. We’ve respect for Italy.

'They’re a fantastic team with wonderful players but there’s certainly no fear. We can’t wait for kick-off to get going.
