FIFA needs a 'new breath of fresh air' declared UEFA president Michel Platini as he withdrew his support for FIFA counterpart Sepp Blatter.

Football's world governing body has been plagued by negative press in recent weeks, with the revelations about potential corruption in the vote for the Qatar 2022 World Cup proving the most damaging.

Blatter, 78, announced at the FIFA Congress in Sao Paulo earlier this week that he would seek re-election for a fifth term despite previously running on the promise of stepping down after this stint.

He also sparked and an angry reaction in Britain when he claimed that the allegations against the Qatar World Cup bid process were based on 'racism and discrimination', as well as claiming there was a plot to 'destroy FIFA'.

But speaking about the Swiss, Platini said: 'I do not support him. I have known him for a long time and I like him but I am not in favour of him having a new term.

'I supported him in 1998 but I do not support him in 2014. And in the future I will not support Mr Blatter.

'I am supporting him no longer, it's finished.

'He knows it, I told him. I think FIFA needs a new breath of fresh air.

'In 2011, he asked for [UEFA's support] and told us that this was his last term.'

Platini himself has yet to confirm whether he himself will run in opposition to Blatter at the elections later this year, but when asked he said: 'It is an option.

'But it is not because of Blatter that Michel Platini would stand. And it is not because of Sepp Blatter that Michel Platini would not appear.

'My only concern is what I want to do. I am almost 60 years and I need to know what I want.

'I just want to be sure what I want to do. In my life, I wanted to be a footballer, it went well. I was asked to coach, and to be president of the organising committee of the 1998 World Cup, I liked it.

'Then I became a member of the Executive Committee (FIFA). Now I am very happy to be at UEFA. I am loved by national associations. But FIFA is something important.'

Platini said he also had to think about the impact on his family if he went for the FIFA presidency.

The 58-year-old said: 'It is not just mine but also that of my family, my children. That's a lot of people.

'But choosing between UEFA and FIFA is not choosing between going to hospital or going to prison - the choice is not a negative one. But when I launch, it is to win.'

Blatter on the other hand was infuriated by the reception he received from UEFA federation members, including FA chairman Greg Dyke, earlier this week.

Dyke had told Blatter at a meeting of UEFA countries on Tuesday his claim that racism was behind World Cup corruption allegations in the British media was 'offensive and totally unacceptable'.

But Blatter then told a news conference after the FIFA Congress in Sao Paulo: 'I have had to accept a number of blows, but what I saw and heard at the UEFA meeting was the most disrespectful thing I have experienced in my entire life, on the football pitch and in my home.'

Blatter was given the green light to seek re-election by FIFA delegates yesterday when they decided to remove age limits or restrict the length of a presidency.

The UEFA president is just the latest high-profile football man to withdraw their support for Blatter, with Dyke, FA vice-chairman David Gill and the head of the Dutch FA Michael van Praag already confirming they no longer support the Swiss.

Blatter reacted angrily to claims in the British media that Mohamed bin Hammam arranged for payments to be made in order to acquire votes for the Qatari bid for the 2022 World Cup, forcing a heated response from Dyke and Gill.
