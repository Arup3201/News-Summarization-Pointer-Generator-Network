In recent weeks Britain has given the world a lesson in sporting prowess.

But it's unlikely many of the competitors at this eccentric athletic competition will be troubling the Lions squad or Andy Murray at Wimbledon.

The Chap Olympiad, held every year since 2005 in London's Bedford Square, is a chance for Britain's most refined gentlemen to demonstrate their panache by competing in events such as umbrella jousting, the pipeathlon and iron board surfing.

On your marks: A man lights a pipe to mark the beginning of the Chap Olympiad, an eccentric sporting event held every year in Bedford Square, London

In training: A well-dressed chap lights his pipe in preparation for the pipeathlon

On guard: Umbrella jousting is among the weird and wacky events celebrated at the Chap Olympiad

Alternative: Two gentleman engage in a bout of umbrella jousting as other finely-dressed attendees watch on

The event, billed as a 'celebration of athletic ineptitude and immaculate trouser creases', is the creation of The Chap magazine.

The bi-monthly publication, edited by Gustav Temple, glorifies a dandyish way of life involving tweed, pipe smoking and fine facial hair.

Decked out in their finest pinstripe suits and bowler hats, gentlemen took part in the events which were competitive, but at all time well-mannered.

The pipeathlon involved running several laps around the venue while maintaining a fully lit pipe while umbrella jousting was competed from the saddle of vintage bikes.

Bread basketball saw diners trying their best to catch bread as their food was used for a game of 'Bread Basketball' between waiters.

Manners: A competitor takes part in 'Bread Basketball' - where a table of dinners attempt to catch food as waiters play basketball with their bread

Taking a break: A chap takes a rest from the rambunctious entertainment to sip a glass of red wine

Ladies are also welcome to attend the Chap Olympiad and many wear showing off their best vintage styles

Steady on: The Tea Pursuit saw competitors take a cup of tea from one rider to the next

Vintage: A chapette enjoys a puff on her pipe  during the event which was held in glorious weather

Careful: Riders in the Tea Pursuit struggle to pass a full cup from one to the next

A new event, Tea Pursuit, tasked 
competitors with riding around a course carrying a cup of tea from one 
rider to the next. The winner was based on who had the fullest cup at 
the end.

And Beach Volleybowler involved hitting a bowler hat over a wire suspended between two hat stands.

Gentleman
 and ladies competed to win coveted bronze, silver and gold cravats - or
 simply a self-congratulatory puff on their pipe.

A roaring time: A lady smokes using a 1920s style cigarette holder

Reward: Gold, silver and bronze cravats were handed out to winning competitors

The event is the brainchild of The Chap magazine - a publication dedicated to a dandyish way of life

A jolly good laugh: The vintage festival takes place surrounded by the Georgian architecture of Bedford Square

Handbags at dawn: Two competitors engage at close quarters with brollys and briefcases

Spiffing good show: Although the events were competitive, good manners are observed at all times
