Had she been delivered just hours earlier, life may be very different for Cassie Wiggins.

The now four-year-old is severely brain damaged, suffers epilepsy and requires around the clock care.

Four years on and a hospital has admitted a series of mistakes made by medical staff caring for her mother Sarah Myatt-Maley as she went into labour, are to blame. 

Cassie was born at the Good Hope Hospital in Birmingham, after her mother was induced having gone 15 days over her due date.

Cassie Wiggins, pictured left with her sister Katrina, suffered severe brain damage at birth resulting in her being diagnosed with epilepsy and cerebral palsy

Midwives failed to continuously monitor her heartbeat, and so missed it dropping dangerously low, leaving her brain starved of oxygen. 

Hospital bosses have admitted had Cassie been delivered hours earlier, the brain damage she suffered would, in all likelihood, have been avoided. 

But the youngster has been left unable to walk, talk or communicate.

She suffers epilepsy and has also been diagnosed with cerebral palsy, and visual impairment. 

The Heart of England NHS Trust, which runs the hospital, is now in the process of negotiating a payout to provide a lifetime care package for Cassie. 

Speaking out on World Cerebral Palsy Day today, Miss Myatt-Maley, who is Cassie's full-time carer along with her partner James Wiggin, 23, said: 'Our little girl had the worst start to life as a result of the hospital's mistakes and that has been very difficult for us as a family to come to terms with.

'She has been diagnosed with severe cerebral palsy and has severe learning difficulties, epilepsy and visual impairment. 

'She cannot walk, talk or communicate in any way with us or her little sister.

'She is now nil by mouth and can only be fed through her gastrostomy tube. 

'Cassie is regularly in and out of hospital with chest infections and will be entirely reliant on us for the rest of her life.'

The Heart of England NHS Trust which operates the Good Hope Hospital admitted had Cassie, right, been delivered hours earlier, in all likelihood, the severe brain damage would have been avoided

The 24-year-old, who is also mother to two-year-old Katrina,  added: 'We are pleased and relieved that the Trust have accepted responsibility for the mistakes made when Cassie was born.

'Now this paves the way for us to continue to provide her with the very best care for the rest of her life so she can grow and develop.'

A spokesperson for the hospital said: 'The Trust admitted liability at the earliest opportunity, following investigations into the events of Cassie's birth. 

'An apology letter has been sent and this includes information about lessons learned and steps implemented to improve patient safety. 

'Our respective legal teams will now be working towards determining the appropriate level of compensation to ensure Cassie's lifelong needs are met.'
