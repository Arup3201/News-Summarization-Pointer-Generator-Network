A couple whose £1,000 holiday to Tenerife was ruined by building work have been awarded a full refund by Thomson - after originally been offered a £30 holiday voucher.

Jordan Pedelty and Dee Kimmings, from Slaithwaite, West Yorkshire, say they were woken at 7am every morning by drilling and banging at the Columbus Aparthotel, Playa de las Americas, Tenerife.

When booking the week-long holiday with Thomson, the couple say they were not warned about any building works taking place at the resort during their break.

Jordan Pedelty and Dee Kimmings have now been awarded a full refund for their ruined Tenerife holiday

After MailOnline Travel reported yesterday on the holiday company's paltry offer to compensate a holiday from hell, the travel company has agreed to a full refund.

'It's unbelievable really, I'm just so pleased we have finally got the money back,' a Mr Pedelty said..

'They have said they will transfer the full amount, and we have 28 days to accept the offer, which we will.

'It's the right thing in the end; we had already booked another holiday for the six-week (school) holidays in the summer, so this will really help with that.' 

Mr Pedelty's anger grew when he found other holidaymakers had received a discount due to the work

Mr Pedelty added: 'There was banging and drilling, it was just a nightmare. If you've had a night out you don't want to be woken at 7am.

'We couldn't even go to the pool because it was too noisy.

'What made it worse was when we were chatting to other holidaymakers they, they all said they were told about the building work and had got a reduced price because of it.

'That just made us feel even worse.'

Other guests at the Columbus Aparthotel were warned in advance of the building works

Around 30-40 rooms at the Columbus Aparthotel were being worked on, according to Mr Pedelty

Mr Pedelty estimates that 30-40 rooms were being renovated during their trip - and he took photographs of the work being carried out and also took footage which captures the noise.

After contacting Thomson to complain about the noise that disrupted their stay, Mr Pedelty claims they were originally offered £30 in holiday vouchers.

A gesture from the Thomson shop in the Kingsgate Centre in Huddersfield topped this up to £130 in total, and then an offer of £300 was made.

A spokesperson told MailOnline Travel: 'Thomson is sorry to hear that Mr Pedelty was unhappy with his holiday accommodation in Tenerife.

'Unfortunately, due to a system error, notification of the building work was not sent to Mr Pedelty prior to departure. However, every effort was made to position him in a room as far away from any disruption as possible. We are in contact with Mr Pedelty directly to resolve his complaint.

'We would like to reassure customers that this hotel remains a popular choice with guests.'
