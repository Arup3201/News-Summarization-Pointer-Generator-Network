From lip-syncing parades to signs on the subway, there are many spontaneous and romantic ways to pop surprise proposals.

But one man pulled out all the stops to surprise his partner of five years by proposing on a log flume- but the unsuspecting fiance-to-be had no idea until they collected their souvenir photograph.

Lawrence Key, 19, from Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire persuaded his friends to hold up pieces of paper spelling out ‘Will you marry me?’ with an arrow pointing to 20-year-old Sophie Stock sitting in the front of the flume.

Screaming at the front of a falling log flume Sophie Sperring had no idea her boyfriend was proposing

Sophie had no idea her partner had popped the question until they climbed off the ride and collected their souvenir photo.

She said friends covered her eyes as they came off the Loggers Leap ride. It meant she had no idea about the proposal until she was handed the photograph automatically taken of all logs plunging down the flume.

Sophie said: 'I had no idea he was planning this. I did not even know we were going to Thorpe Park until all my friends turned up in the morning when I was still dressed in my pyjamas.

'I could not understand why Lawrence kept his jacket it on all day as it was really hot.

Sophie was completely taken aback by Lawrence's proposal and was impressed by how everyone had kept it a secret

'When we went on the ride they told me to keep facing forward, but I thought nothing of it.

'I knew something was going on when my friends covered my eyes as we came off the ride - now I know it was so I didn't see the picture on the screen.

As soon as the stunned garden centre worker set eyes on the picture smitten Lawrence dropped on to one knee and pulled out his grandmother’s ring in the middle of Thorpe Park theme park.

Overcome with emotion, Sophie said yes before Lawrence swept her off her feet and whisked her away to Rome for a romantic three-day city break.

'I am amazed Lawrence and our friends
managed to keep it all a secret. And I got a second surprise when 
Lawrence said we were going away, but kept the destination a secret all 
the way until we were about to get on the plane.

'Rome was amazing and I am really excited about getting married. It is all so much to take in.'

The couple, who have been together for five years, jetted off to Rome to celebrate

Stunned Sophie had no idea Lawrence had been planning the imaginative proposal and the couple had never even discussed getting married, even though they live together.

Lawrence revealed his incredible relief that Sophie said ‘yes’ - because he had been planning the proposal for two years.

Bride-to-be Sophie said: 'I was really surprised when I saw the picture. I am really happy and excited to be getting married.'

Sophie, who works at a home and garden store, and Lawrence, a bakery worker, met at Ralph Sadleir Middle School, Herts., and have been together for five years.

The couple now plan to wed on August 21 2014, which is a poignant day as it is the seventh anniversary of the death of Sophie’s father, Grant Stock, who died from cancer aged just forty five.

Sophie, whose grandparents also got 
together when they were 15, added: 'I wanted to get married on the 
anniversary of my father's death to make it a happy day too.'

Sophie’s proud mother Sally Stock, 44, who helped put the plan into action, said: 'He asked my permission to marry her which I thought was very nice about a month before.

'I was quite excited about it knowing it was going to be such a surprise.'

Sally, a civil servant, drove Lawrence up to Norfolk to Sophie’s grandmother Shirley’s house to collect her ring to use for the proposal.

She added: 'He had it in his jacket and, even thought it was really hot, he kept it on all day because he was too scared of loosing it.

'They nearly had a row because she kept saying "why don’t you take it off".

'I was waiting for the phone call all day but she didn’t call untill about 3pm because I think she needed to calm down.'
