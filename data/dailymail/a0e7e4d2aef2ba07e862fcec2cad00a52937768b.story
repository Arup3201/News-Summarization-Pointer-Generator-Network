They came from near and far, the great and good of football, to pay tribute to one of their own. But this was no occasion for revelling in tales of past sporting glories.

Instead, and quite rightly, the funeral service for Sandy Jardine concentrated more on the man than on the footballer.

John Greig was mentioned as an enduring friend first, team-mate second. The recollection of a young Jardine spending his first Rangers bonus on a fur coat for his mum, meanwhile, said more than any list of medals ever could.

On a bitterly cold morning in Edinburgh, hundreds gathered at Mortonhall Crematorium not because Sandy Jardine was famous as a Rangers, Hearts and Scotland player. They turned out to show their respect for a man who, as the Reverend John Shields made clear, valued ‘love, loyalty and respect’ above even the most glittering prizes on offer during his career.

Greig, the
 Greatest Ever Ranger, was one of the pall bearers on a day that saw 
some of the Scottish game’s most well-respected figures in attendance. 
Sir Alex Ferguson chatted with Walter Smith and Willie Henderson, Celtic
 were represented by Peter Lawwell, Billy McNeil and Bertie Auld, while 
neither Gordon McQueen nor Joe Jordan would have even considered missing
 the occasion.

Of
 course, plenty more of Jardine’s old team-mates from the class of ’72 
were in attendance, the Cup Winners’ Cup victory that bound them 
together in the 40 odd years since only a small part of the affection 
they felt for Sandy.

Hearts
 were represented, too, in the shape of current boss Gary Locke and 
former manager Craig Levein, while the entire Rangers first team – 
including coach Ian Durrant, on crutches – arrived together.

Jardine’s
 love of music was evident even before the hearse arrived, with speakers
 outside the main chapel relaying recordings of My Girl and This Old Heart of Mine, while he was borne into the chapel to How Sweet It Is To Be Loved By You.

The
 service itself began with an apology of sorts, the Reverend Shields 
explaining that he would be using both of Jardine’s Christian names – he
 was Sandy to the outside world but always Billy to the family – 
throughout.

The
 minister having begged forgiveness for any confusion caused, he 
proceeded with a ceremony that was quietly religious, although the 
volume did rise as mourners joined in a rendition of The Old Rugged 
Cross.

The
 eulogy was delivered by best friend Davie Ross, who said: ‘The three 
things that Billy loved most were football, friends and family.

‘We all know about Billy, or should I say Sandy, Jardine’s reputation as a legendary Rangers and Scotland footballer.

‘To
 all football fans, no matter where their allegiances lay, he will be 
remembered as one of the greatest ambassadors of the game.

‘He was a wonderful player who played to win but played fairly, and bore no grudges once the final whistle was blown.

‘To
 the legions of Rangers fans, he will quite rightly be remembered not 
only for his football ability but as someone who served the club with 
great distinction and loyalty – particularly through the recent 
financial crisis.

‘If you read a newspaper in the past week, you’ll all know the statistics about caps and trophies won.

‘As Ally McCoist said, though, I’d rather talk about the man than the footballer.

‘So it’s Billy, the family friend. Not Sandy, the Rangers legend.’

Legend: Jardine was a Rangers hero and won 38 caps for Scotland between 1971 and 1980

Grief: Rangers fans laid hundreds of fans in tribute to their former defender.

Mention
 was made of Jardine’s childhood in Edinburgh, his love of cards and 
golf, and his refusal ever to forget his old pals when he hit the big 
time.

To
 illustrate just how grounded the young up-and-coming footballer was at a
 time when his head might easily have been turned, Ross – who recalled 
Jardine’s daily commute to training in the company of Greig, a firm 
friend until the end – revealed: ‘He signed for Rangers in 1964 and his 
first bonus was paid in cash.

‘Billy
 sat on the bus tightly holding his pocket, because he was terrified 
that he might lose the money. But he took it home and bought his mum a 
fur coat.’

There
 were laughs, as Jardine would have wanted, with one tale about he and 
former Rangers chief executive Martin Bain getting confused between 
sinks and urinals in a restaurant at the top of the Eifel Tower 
thankfully short on detail.

Jardine
 did a great deal with his close-knit group of childhood pals, including
 travelling to watch the Masters a few years ago – and scoring tickets 
for the 100 metres final at the London Olympics.

Ross,
 with a nod to his old friend’s renowned turn of pace, recalled: ‘When 
Usain Bolt flashed past the winning post, Billy announced that, 45 years
 ago, he would have given him a run for his money. Aye.’

Thanks
 were offered to the many friends who had visited with Jardine in the 
few months since he was told that the cancer he’d battled so bravely 
since November 2012 was now terminal.

And,
 of course, much of the focus was on his wife, Shona, children Steven 
and Nicola, as well as the seven grandchildren who brought him so much 
joy on those days out at East Links Country Park.

Ross,
 who paid tribute to the NHS and the Macmillan Cancer Support staff who 
helped his friend, added: ‘Billy’s strength of character and courage was
 beyond belief. Never once did we hear him complain or ask: “Why me?”

‘In
 all the years I’ve known him, Billy was never one to talk about 
himself. He’ s got two ears and one mouth – and he uses them in that 
proportion.

‘We should make sure that his memory lives on in all of us. He was simply the best.’

Shields,
 who spoke movingly about Jardine’s integrity, honesty, tolerance and 
remarkable commitment to self-discipline, treating his body like a 
temple, followed readings and poems by leading mourners in the singing 
of My Way.

The
 order of service for the day summed up the collective feeling of so 
many present, a picture of Jardine on the back accompanied by the words:
 ‘A legend in his lifetime. In our hearts forever.’
