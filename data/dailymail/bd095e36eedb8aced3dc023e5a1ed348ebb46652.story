A dog has been found alive in the rubble of his family's destroyed home after being dragged more than 100 feet in Washington's deadly mudslide.

Buddy the Labrador was covered in dust when he was pulled from the debris of his family's house in Darrington on Sunday, lifting spirits in a time of unimaginable heartbreak.

Buddy and a cat were inside the home while their family, the Kuntzes, were at a baseball game on Saturday morning. When they returned home, they found the house 100 feet from its base.

Found! Buddy the chocolate Labrador was pulled from the debris on Sunday after relatives heard him moaning

Safe: Buddy was covered with dust and a few cuts but otherwise unharmed by the mudslide

The family had given up hope of finding their animals in the home - a farm that has been in the family for five generations - but returned the following day to see what they could salvage.

'We were looking through all the rubble and we heard the dog whining,' one of his owners, Quinton, told KBOI.

They managed to pull the beloved pet from beneath the collapsed farmhouse and carried him to safety. He gave one shake of his dust-covered fur and began walking with ease.

'I
 just broke down crying, really happy that my dog was alright,' Quinton 
said. 'I'm just shocked how well he did against my whole house falling 
on him.'

The Kuntz family did not find their cat but they are now helping to rescue other animals whose homes were caught in the mudslide.

The moment of joy came amid heartbreak for the family, who lost an aunt, Linda McPherson, 69.

Mrs McPherson, who had grown up on the family farm with her sisters, lived in a house next door to the Kuntzes and was at home with her husband Gary when the ground started to give way.

Gary McPherson was able to grab wood from his recliner chair, which he used to make space for him to breathe.

Loss: The family's aunt, 69-year-old Linda McPherson, was killed in the mudslide as she sat in her home, which was next door to the farm. Her husband Gary was also in their home but he survived

'We have lost a great, great sister, but we're a strong family and we're going to get through this,' said Linda's sister, Irene Kuntz.

The family, including Buddy the dog, are now staying with other relatives.

Authorities have confirmed 14 fatalities following Saturday's mile-long mudslide, and there are as many as 176 people unaccounted for. The search continues for victims trapped in the debris.
