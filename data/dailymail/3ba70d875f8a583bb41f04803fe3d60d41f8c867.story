Wanted: Sgt James Reading is the target of a global manhunt after he 
groped four teenagers and then went on the run

An international manhunt is underway for a paedophile Air Training Corps sergeant who fled the country after abusing female cadets. 

Sgt James Reading was found guilty in his absence of groping four teenagers while on night exercises and at illegal underage drinking parties at his squadron hut in Okehampton, North Devon.

He was today jailed for ten years at Exeter Crown Court as police resumed the search for the fugitive, who has been on the run since jumping bail in June.

Reading was the NCO in day-to-day charge of a group of 30 cadets, but used his position to assault four girl cadets, aged 14 to 16, in 2011.

He abused one girl during a sleepover party he organised at the ATC hut on the night before a Remembrance Day parade and assaulted another after telling her she may be promoted if she went on night exercises with him.

He plied his victims with alcohol at the unofficial parties at the ATC hut where he hid his activities by putting bin bags over the windows as makeshift curtains.

The sergeant invited boys to the parties but sent them on errands or into different rooms while he was carrying out his attacks.

He offered one girl £50 to touch her breast and was caught red-handed when one female cadet burst into the hut’s kitchen to find him with a topless, terrified and hysterical 14-year-old.

Reading, 35, of Plymouth, denied eight offences of sexual activity with a child or inciting a child to take part in sexual activity but was found guilty.

The offences related to a 14-year-old and two 15-year-olds.

He was cleared of sexually assaulting another 16-year-old cadet after the jury heard he may have believed she consented.

And he was also cleared of an unrelated charge of raping a former girlfriend.

He was jailed for ten years with a four-year extended licence and banned from having unsupervised contact with children indefinitely.

Judge Erik Salomonsen said: 'The ATC fulfils and important role in the community and parents must know they can rely on them to look after their children.

'It goes without saying this applies to their moral as well as their physical welfare and the highest standards should have been adhered to in relation to alcohol and the separation of the sexes during overnight activities.

'Adults must set an example and it is beyond belief that an NCO in such an organisation should be able to put himself in a position to abuse young cadets.

'He worked himself into a position of responsibility well beyond his abilities.

'He had an unhealthy interest in sex with young girls and was determined to satisfy himself in a wholly selfish way regardless of the views of those around him.

'In my judgment he is a dangerous man, particularly when in drink and in a position of responsibility with access to children.'After the case Detective Constable Chris Amey said the hunt for Reading will go on in this country and abroad.

He said: 'We have already made extensive inquiries which and we may consider an appeal on Crimewatch. We have some evidence he has gone to France and we may involve international agencies.'

The ATC is the RAF's cadet force, divided into six regions, 36 wings and more than 900 squadrons within communities around the UK.

Its aim is to promote and encourage a practical interest in aviation and the Royal Air Force among young people, provide training and encourage 'the spirit of adventure' and the qualities of leadership and good citizenship. 

Cadets are offered the opportunity to fly planes, attend camps, take part in competitive sports and have a go at shooting, music, abseiling and engineering projects.

An MOD spokesman said Reading has been dismissed from the organisation.

He added: 'Safeguarding the welfare of cadets and volunteers in the Air Cadets Organisation is of paramount importance.

'Dedicated staff work to provide a safe and secure environment for all those involved with the ACO.'
