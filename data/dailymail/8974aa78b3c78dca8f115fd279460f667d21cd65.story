A disgruntled resident has posted a hilarious rant on their neighbour's door, berating them for their angry lovemaking, 'primeval grunting' and 'Western Sydney' accent.

In the passive aggressive missive, which is titled, 'To The Resident Of Apartment 12', the  writer even asks their amorous neighbour to bolt the bed to the floor in a bid to keep the noise down.

The anonymous author lives in the Sydney suburb of Bondi which is saturated with hedonistic teenagers and backpackers, and the note was picked up by Reddit on Friday morning.

Yours disgruntedly! Vexed neighbour in Bondi, Sydney, fires this hilarious missive to their neighbour begging them to bolt their bed to the floor and curb their 'very loud, very short yet very annoying' love-making sessions

After congratulating the recipient on their 'lustrous social life' and 'many friends, (many of whom are rather good looking) the secret scribe says they cannot stand 'what seems to happen of a Saturday night between the hours of 2-3am.

And in a clear dig as the mystery lover's prowess, who they claim is called Nick, the fellow resident swipes, 'luckily for me Nick doesn't appear to last long, and for that I am thankful. 

'I do not wish to pry in on your sex life, apartment 12,' they continue, 'however I do ask that before you mount Nick (or the rhino) I suggest you bolt the bed to the floor as so the rest of the beautiful residents here do not have to listen to your VERY loud, VERY short yet VERY annoying lovemaking sessions.

The Sydney suburb Bondi is a mecca for students, backpackers and fun-seekers searching for sun, sand, sea... and booze

'Let me give you a play by play,' they continue. 'As I am asleep, dreaming of playing the perfect game of golf, I near the 13th hole, when suddenly I am awoken by what I can only describe as sounding like a Rhinoceros attempting to demolish a wall, with a jackhammer, whilst high on meth...and cocaine.'

The wordsmith continues, 'I do not know who Nick is or how much he weighs, I can only assume it is a lot due to the fact that on several occasions my bedroom slight begins to shake.'

The cranky writer also comes across as a bit snobby as they confess they can handle the 'hordes of alcohol-fuelled guests, coming and going at all hours of the morning.'

And they admit, 'I can handle your annoying and slightly western suburbs sounding voice as you seem to proclaim your love for your hordes of booze filled guests,' and 'I can deal with the hordes of intoxicated foreigners screaming 'I love Bondi' in broken English as I eat dinner with my family'.

Berating them for their stray cigarettes  that land on the balcony, the troubled typist helpfully reminds the recipient, 'that ashtrays have been around since 1825 and are available from most good retail outlets,' and points them in the direction of the Bondi convenience store.
