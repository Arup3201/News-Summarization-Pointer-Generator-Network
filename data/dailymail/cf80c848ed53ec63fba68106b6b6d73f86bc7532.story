A member of the U.S. 'Miracle on Ice' hockey team that scored a tremendous upset victory over the Soviets during the 1980 Winter Olympics is selling his gold medal.

Mark Pavelich was one of 20 players who made the final roster of Team USA largely made up of inexperienced college students, who were called upon to face off against USSR's finest players.

Against overwhelming odds, the ragtag team of American skaters triumphed over their heavily favored opponents and went on to win the gold in their final match against Finland.

Beginning April 25, sports fans and history buffs alike will have a chance to buy Pavelich’s historic medal, which is being sold through the Dallas-based auction house Heritage Auctions. Bidding ends May 16.

Heritages sports director Chirrs Ivy told the Minneapolis Star Tribune that the auctioneers were contacted by Pavelich a year-and-a-half ago asking them to put a value on his medal.

In 2010, his teammate Mark Wells sold his own Olympic gold for $310,700 - up more than $200,000 from the opening bid of $100,000.

In Pavelich’s case, the bidding will start at $62,500, but Ivy told the paper that he believes the lot will fetch a minimum of $250,000. 

The auctioneer said Pavelich, 56, is not struggling financially, but he would like to sell the medal to help his children with their college tuition and establish a trust.

Masterpiece: All the medals for the Winter Games were crafted by Tiffany & Co

High hopes: The medal, which comes with its original presentation box (pictured) and a letter of provenance, is expected to fetch a minimum of $250,000 at auction

The medals for the Lake Placid Olympics were crafted by Tiffany & Co. Each gold disc hanging off a blue-and-white ribbon features a raised torch framed between the words 'XIII Olympic Winter Games' and the Olympic rings.

On the reverse there is a conifer branch opposite the text 'Lake Placid 1980.' Below, engraved lettering says 'Ice Hockey, Mark Pavelich.' The original presentational case is included.

The auction winner also will receive a ‘letter of provenance’ from Pavelich.

Pavelich rates among the most recognizable figures from Lake Placid, earning two assists in the victory over the Soviets, including Mike Eruzione's game-winning goal.

Private citizen: After successfully playing for the New York Rangers and retiring from hockey in the early 1990s, Pavelich built himself a career in land development; he plans to use the proceeds from the auction to help his children financially and start a trust 

He would go on to set a still-standing record for points as a rookie for the New York Rangers, and is ranked number 83 in John Wiley & Sons' volume ‘100 Ranger Greats.’

In 1999, Sports Illustrated named the ‘Miracle on Ice’ the Top Sports Moment of the 20th Century.

Pavelich was among nine members of the University of Minnesota hockey team who went to Lake Placid under the command of their coach, Herb Brooks, played by Kurt Russell in the 2004 hit film 'Miracle.'

Unlike some of his teammates, Pavelvich has spent the past three decades away from the spotlight. After retiring from hockey in the early 90s, he made a career for himself in land development.
