An American businessman who spent over a year in one of the world's toughest prisons after being accused of laundering Bolivian drug money has been released following a campaign by actor Sean Penn.

Jacob Ostreicher, 53, a grandfather of 11 from Brooklyn, is currently under house arrest in Bolivia while a criminal investigation into corruption and extortion involving a dozen Bolivian government officials continues. 

Ostreicher spent 520 days in the notorious Palmasola prison - famous for being run by a council of inmates known as the Disciplina Interna  - where he said he was in constant fear for his life.

He was only released after Hollywood actor Penn made two trips to the country and personally appealed to Bolivia's President Evo Morales.

Penn, who travelled to the South American country in his capacity as Haiti's Ambassador at Large, praised the president's 'humility and nobility'.

He wrote in his Huffington Post blog: 'This investigation has led to the unprecedented arrests of numerous Bolivian officials and their cohorts representing a web (called "red' in Bolivia) of extortionists and narco traffickers, and an unprecedented and bold demand for justice affirming the Bolivian government's tremendous will to serve its people honorably.'

Ostreicher, who is suffering from Parkinson's disease which came on in prison, must remain in the country for a transitional period until the investigation is complete.

In 2008, the flooring contractor invested $200,000 - his life savings - to become a junior partner in a Bolivian rice growing venture.

The business appeared to be doing well, employing 200 workers and producing 40 million pounds of rice in the first year.

But supporters claim Osreicher became the victim of extortion in a country that is riddled with corruption.

Former FBI agent Steve Moore, who campaigned for Amanda Knox, told ABC news : 'Here's a guy they see coming in from New York who's got probably a lot of liquid cash and they saw an opportunity.'

Ostreicher's wife Miriam, who has made several trips to visit her husband is afraid to discuss the details of the case.

She said: 'The way things are going there, the justice system and corruption. It doesn't look like they are going to release him anytime soon.'

Ostreicher says he fears for his life as has appeared in court wearing a bullet proof vest.

He told ABC: 'I'm all alone. It's an absolute nightmare, I'm begging the American people to help me.'
