Brooklyn's very own Santa Claus is doing his best to bring Christmas cheer to hundreds of children affected by Hurricane Sandy.

Dressed up in a bushy white beard and red suit and carrying a sack full of toys, Michael Sciaraffo could easily be mistaken for the real Father Christmas as he delivers gifts in storm-ravaged neighbourhoods.

Every afternoon and night he stuffs his red sack to the brim with presents and heads out to personally deliver them to children who faced a Christmas without presents after they were washed away during the hurricane.

Christmas cheer: Michael Sciaraffo stuffs his sack full of gifts as he prepares to deliver them to children affected by Hurricane Sandy

Hope: Mr Sciaraffo says collecting and delivering presents in storm-ravaged neighbourhoods is like a full-time job

Delivery: He arrives with a sack of Christmas gifts at a family home in the Belle Harbor neighborhood of the Queens borough of New York

Thanks: John Taylor, far left, his sons Nicholas, 5, second from left, and Johnny, 9, second from right, and their neighbour Liam Siederman, 10, centre, watch as Mr Sciaraffo continues with his deliveries

And with less than a week before Christmas, his 'Secret Sandy Claus Project' is keeping him very busy. He hopes to deliver gifts to around 1,000 children during the next few days.

'Between the requests coming in for personal visits as well as the influx of donations, it's been a full time job,' said Mr Sciaraffo, a 31-year-old political consultant.

'And kudos to Santa, because I don't know how he pulls it off every year.'

Respect: Mr Sciaraffo, a business consultant, has credited the real Santa Claus for his hard work at Christmas after gaining his own first-hand experience of delivering presents

Boxes of toys are piled on tables and all over the floor of Mr Sciaraffo's apartment where he spends most of the day updating his list of toy requests and donations, which are pouring in.

He initially began jotting down the 
requests on Post-it notes, but as demand steadily grew he created a 
spreadsheet and taped it to the wall.

'The
goal was to match up each child with a toy that they liked or asked 
Santa for, for Christmas,' he explained. 'We basically tried to pair them
up with toys I had in stock.'

The
charitable enterprise grew out of a Sandy donation outreach effort that
Mr Sciaraffo had been spearheading for weeks in the wake of the storm, 
drumming up donations of clothing and food through Facebook.

As the holidays approached, he realised that lots of children would be without their toys this year - and
with their parents preoccupied with the drudgery of storm repairs, many
children probably would not even get to sit on Santa's lap. So he 
decided to fill that gap himself.

'When I was a kid, my toys were very 
important to me,' Mr Sciaraffo said. 'That's their security blanket, so 
to speak. I couldn't sit home and do nothing.'

Donations
are coming in by the truckload from all over the country and Mr Sciaraffo 
has received help from fellow New Yorkers like Sean Turk, a 
father of three from Queens who has raised more than $2,000 from his 
community and has been filling toy requests at local stores.

'I started it with $500 of my own,' Mr Turk said, 'and then people just started contributing.'

Joy: Hurricane Sandy hit soon after little Ella's first birthday and destroyed her toys. Here she receives a gift from Mr Sciaraffo (with her mother Elizabeth Sampol)

Happy: Another youngster receives a present. Mr Sciaraffo's Brooklyn apartment is now stuffed with donated gifts

Donations: More gifts are delivered to Mr Sciaraffo for children affected by the hurricane after his Secret Sandy Claus Project caught the public's imagination

On a recent rainy afternoon, Mr Sciaraffo pulled on his white wig and beard and drove out to weather-beaten Belle Harbor, a town on the Rockaway peninsula.

The first stop: the darkened oceanfront home of Elizabeth Sampol, who was waiting upstairs with her daughter, Ella.

Little Ella gazed up as Mr Sciaraffo
handed her a toy duck. Sandy struck just after her first birthday 
party, destroying all of her toys when the basement flooded.

'As
you can see from the outside of the house and the inside of the house, 
it's been a disaster,' said Elizabeth Sampol, who has been living in a 
FEMA-funded hotel room for several weeks with her family.

'Santa's Grotto': Donated toys and other Christmas presents are piled around his Brooklyn home

Charity: Mr Sciaraffo uses a list he created to match children with the toys he has collected for them

Ready for work: He prepares his Santa Claus costume for the next Christmas deliveries

'We haven't had time to take her to go see Santa Claus or to do anything that we would want to do for her first Christmas that actually matters.'

Ms Sampol said she was amazed when she learned about Mr Sciaraffo's project.

'He contacted me and he told me how he's been going around giving out gifts,' she said. ;I was so happy that someone would do this in his free time.'
