A woman who won compensation from Lotto rapist Iorworth Hoare has waived her right to anonymity after being awarded an MBE.

Shirley Woodman, who was previously known only as Mrs A, has told of her battle to receive a landmark settlement from Hoare in 2009.

She spoke to BBC Look North after being made an MBE in the 2012 Queen’s New Year Honours for services to the community in Yorkshire.

Landmark case: Shirley Woodman, who was previously known only as Mrs A, has spoken about her battle to receive compensation from Iorworth Hoare, right

Retired teacher Mrs Woodman, 82, was attacked by Hoare in Roundhay Park, in Leeds, in 1988.

He was jailed for life the following year for Mrs Woodman’s attempted rape but scooped £7.2 million in 2004 when he bought a Lotto Extra ticket while on day release from prison.

Mrs Woodman sued Hoare for damages when she heard of his win but he contested the claim, arguing that victims of sex attacks must make their claims within six years.

But in 2008, Mrs Woodman won a groundbreaking ruling from the Law Lords that, in cases of serious assault, courts would have the discretion to extend that time limit.

She was later awarded compensation in an out-of-court settlement with Hoare, who had previous convictions for rape, two other attempted rapes and three indecent assaults when he attacked Mrs Woodman.

Mrs Woodman 
said she was 'horrified and terrified' when she heard of Hoare's Lotto 
win and said she feared he would come to find her to get revenge for 
putting him in prison.

She said she felt the win was 'unjust' and wanted him to pay damages for the psychological injuries she suffered as a result of the attack.

'It was a fantastic struggle. It was a long and traumatic one and it was very hard at times,' she told the BBC.

Mrs Woodman said she had given all of her compensation money to charity and now felt 'composed'.

'I don’t mind now being identified as the Mrs A who took my assailant to court and changed the law,' she said.

Mrs Woodman said she was 'very proud' to receive an MBE after being nominated by her daughter, Shelley Wolfson.

Ms Wolfson said her mother was 'a woman of dignity, a woman of strength'.

'She fought the law of the land and she won,' said Ms Wolfson.

Hoare, who was released from prison in 2005, was forced to flee his mansion in September last year after the words 'Leave or Die' were spray-painted on the gates of his home.

His six-bedroom detached house on the exclusive Darras Hall estate in Newcastle was put up for sale at the bargain price of £595,000 in December.
