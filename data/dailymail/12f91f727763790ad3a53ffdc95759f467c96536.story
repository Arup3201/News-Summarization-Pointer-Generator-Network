The father of the man charged with brutally murdering four people at a Washington mansion calls the crime 'egregious and heartless' and hopes whoever committed the crime 'will suffer the consequences'.

Dennis Wint said in a statement that it pains him that his son, Daron, is charged, but he doesn't discuss his son's guilt or innocence.

Daron Wint is charged with first-degree murder in the deaths of parents Savvas and Amy and 10-year-old Philip Savopoulos, along with housekeeper Veralicia Figueroa.

Authorities say in court papers that they believe others were involved. Wint is the only person charged currently.

As first reported by The Washington Post, Dennis Wint says his family and friends grieve the 'tragic and senseless loss' but they didn't know the victims.

He also says 'we hope that whoever committed these heinous crimes - my son included - will suffer the consequences of their actions.'

The Savopoulos family is being described as always willing to help those less fortunate.

Savvas Savopoulos, 46, his wife Amy, their 10-year-old son Philip and housekeeper Veralicia Figueroa were slain in their home after being held captive for 18 hours on May 14.

Ex-convict Wint has since been charged in connection with their deaths after he allegedly tortured Mr Savopolous into getting a $40,000 ransom delivered to the home.

They are now being remembered in a touching and poignant obituary that recalls the last time Phillip and his two sisters, Abigail and Katerina, were together watching Finding Nemo.

'They are remembered for their devotion to family and charitable efforts for the less fortunate,' read the obituary in The Washington Post.

Abigail and Katrina were away at boarding school at the time of the tragedy.

'Abigail and Katerina doted on their little brother Philip. The three siblings took an active interest in each of the others lives and were always eager for opportunities to spend time together,' reads the obituary.

'Watching movies together was a favorite pastime. Most recently the three cuddled together to watch a favorite movie, Finding Nemo.

'This was a family that maintained an unusually close bond for each other and for those less fortunate.'

The obituary also says that the martial arts center that was set to open the day after the murders was part of a lifelong dream.

The four bodies were found on the burned-out second floor of the home, which smelled like gasoline, according to court documents

'His love for the martial arts started at the young age of seventeen and it was his dream to have a Japanese style center both in architecture and spirit of teaching traditional Japanese martial arts,' it reads.

As for the mother of the family; 'Amy was extremely charismatic and had a huge heart.

'To her family and many friends, Amy represented the same loyalty and devotion, integrity, compassion, and courage as Savvas-values and behaviors they instilled in their children.'

The family's funeral is taking place at the St. Sophia Greek Orthodox church they regularly attend at noon on June 1. Amy and Savvas were known in their local community for being active in a number of charities.

They were known in their neighborhood as regular parishioners and maintained strong ties with Greece.

According to charging documents, Wint and his alleged accomplices held the American Iron Works CEO and his family captive for at least 18 hours in their home on Embassy Row, near Joe Biden's property.

Police believe Wint, a former American Iron Works employee, captured the family at around 6pm. Two pizzas were delivered to the property at 9.15pm. At 9am the next day, Mr Savopoulos called his assistant asking that $40,000 be withdrawn from his Bank of America account and delivered to the house.

By midday, the house was ablaze. The affidavit says Mr and Mrs Savopoulos and Ms Figueroa were stabbed to death, Philip died in the fire.

Police identified Wint as a suspect after finding a half-eaten pizza at the scene, with his DNA on the crust.

Wint was arrested on Thursday, a week after the quadruple homicide, after reportedly paying a New York taxi driver $1,000 to drive him back to the capitol from Brooklyn, where he was staying with his girlfriend.

Police attempted to detain Wint at a motel in Prince George's County, Maryland, but when they arrived he was in a vehicle bound for D.C., driving in convoy with a box truck.

The officers followed the convoy for five miles before cornering the vehicles and detaining Wint along with four others, who have since been released.

Domino's told police their delivery worker arrived at the property at 9.15pm with two pizzas - a whole cheese and a pepperoni.

The worker was instructed to leave the pizzas on the porch, ring the doorbell and leave.

The next day, after fire fighters were called to the burning home, detectives found the whole cheese pizza untouched, and about three quarters of the pepperoni pizza left half-eaten in the box.

It was by running tests on this pizza that detectives found Wint's DNA and named him as the prime suspect.
