He was released on bail pending further inquiries.

Musician Simon Collins - the eldest son of rock star Phil (pictured above together) - has been arrested on suspicion of supplying class A drugs

Simon is lead singer and drummer with rock band Sound of Contact and last month he posted a picture  of himself with his father taken after a concert in New York with the caption: ‘Happy Father’s Day! My old man and I backstage in NY at a recent SOC gig! Love you man. Si.’

Simon made his stage debut aged 12, appearing alongside his father to play drums on the hit single Easy Lover.

Born in London, he moved to Canada when he was eight following his father’s split with his first wife, actress Andrea Bertorelli. He now lives in Devizes, Wiltshire.

At one time there were claims that Phil Collins’s relationship with his older children came a distant second to his desire for international success.

With his second family installed in his 12-bedroom Surrey mansion, Simon and his half-sister Joely were made to stay in a converted barn  500 yards away when they visited.

Two years ago Phil Collins' nephew Philip Austin Collins, 39, (above) was arrested in Peru after £3million-worth of cocaine was found on a yacht he and two other British men were trying to sail across the Atlantic

Simon once said: ‘It was like we were suddenly paying guests. You start to feel maybe you’re in the way.’

Wiltshire Police said yesterday:  ‘A 37-year-old man from Devizes has been arrested for being concerned in the supply of class A drugs and for possession of a class B drug.'
