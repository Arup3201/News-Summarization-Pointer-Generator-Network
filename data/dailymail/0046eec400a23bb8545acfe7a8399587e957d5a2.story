'It is very difficult to know the reason behind the killing, but nothing can justify it,' Father Mario said.

Evidence showed that two of the Roman Catholic nuns had been raped before they were killed, police spokesman Hermenegilde Harimenshi said.

The Vatican said Pope Francis was 'greatly saddened' by the killings of the women, who had worked at the African convent for years. Ms Boggia had been there since the 1970s.

'Pope Francis has learned with great sadness of the murder of three nuns,' Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin said in a telegram sent on the pope's behalf. 

The pope offered condolences in the 'tragic death' of the nuns to their families, the local parishioners and the sisters' order, the Xavarian Missionary Sisters of Mary. 

The Catholic diocese in Parma, Italy, said on its website that the death of Pulici and Raschietti appeared to have been 'the tragic outcome of an armed robbery by a mentally unbalanced person'.

Ms Pulici and Ms Raschietti had served in Burundi for seven years, after working several years in the east of another central African state, the Democratic Republic of Congo.
