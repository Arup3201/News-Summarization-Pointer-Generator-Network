The ex-girlfriend of convicted home-invasion killer Joshua Komisarjevsk said he called her a week after the brutal crime, bragging about the killings and showing 'no remorse in the slightest' for his actions.

As evidence mounts in the penalty phase of his trial and the jury continue to deliberate on whether or not to give him the death penalty, Caroline Mesel revealed that Komisarjevsky even boasted about the ferocity in which he beat Dr William Petit.

Miss Mesel told RadarOnline that the 31-year-old described the events that  led up to the deaths of Jennifer Hawke-Petit and her daughters Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, on 23 July, 2007, with no trace of regret in his voice.

Ex-girlfriend: Caroline Mesel said she doesn't care if Komisarjevsk lives or dies after bragging about the crimes to her in a phone call the week after

She said: 'He bragged about hitting Dr Petit. He said to me, "You should have seen how big this guy was, I had to hit him a number of times".

'I told him that was gross. He didn’t sound remorseful in the slightest.'

No remorse: Joshua Komisarjevsky is said to have bragged to his girlfriend about how hard he beat up Dr Petit

The disturbing conversation took place just a week after the family was attacked and their upscle Cheshire  home was burned down.

Miss Mesel was dating Komisarjevsky at the time but had moved to Arkansas with her family just weeks earlier.

Throughout the trial, Komisarjevsky repeatedly blamed Steven Hayes for being the ringleader of the horrific crime, in which they broke into the Hawke-Petit home, held them captive for hours, eventually raping Mrs Hawke-Petit and her youngest daughter. They also tole $15,000.

They then 
strangled the mother before dousing the house with gasoline and setting
it ablaze with the daughters tied to their beds.

Dr Petit was beaten with a baseball bat and tied up. By the time he managed to get free it was too late to save his family.

Miss Mesel told RadarOnline Komisarjevsk blamed Hayes when he called her a week later, claiming he was the mastermind behind it all.

'He tried to blame it all on Hayes,' she said. 'Josh said he told him, "You got yours, now I get mine",' referring to the fact that Hayes raped Mrs Hawk Petit before strangling her.

A mother's love: Joshua Komisarjevsky's mother

shortly after his 1981 birth

Komisarjevsky admitted to police that he molested 11-year-old Michaela while she was tied to her bed. 

Accomplice: Steven Hayes was convicted and is already on death row for the killings

In his disturbing taped confession, he said: 'One thing led to another and I ended up … performing oral sex on her.

'She had this look on her face that she understood, like you know that, yeah we were here, and we were invading her home and that she understood that we wouldn't hurt them and we'd just be on our way.'

Both daughters died of smoke inhalation.

Photographs of the scene shown to the jury revealed the eldest daughter had freed herself after being tied up and was apparently trying to save her younger sister when she was overcome by smoke. Her body was stretched out on the floor on the landing at the top of the stairs.

Michaela's body was found tied to the bed, with her lower body draped on the floor.

Miss Mesel said, now that all the gruesome details of the crime have come out and Komisarjevsky - who she calls her 'first love' - and Hayes have been convicted, she doesn't care if he lives or dies.

'I go back and forth about whether he gets life or death. I just want it to be over with,' she told Radar.

'I
was devastated (after it happened), I couldn't sleep for weeks and had 
nightmares. I would sleep with my mom and cry constantly. I thought, 
"This can not be happening".

Scorched: The house was set alight with the girls still inside, tied up with pillowcases over their heads

'How do you do that to someone you don’t even know, to two girls who hadn't even lived their life? And to a mom...It was so shocking, I had no idea. Everything changes, your whole perception in life changes.'

She said she has no interest getting any form of explanation or closure from him whether he gets the death penalty or sentenced to life in prison.

She said: 'I won’t try to contact him. I don’t even care about talking to him, it would be a waste of my time hearing words out of his mouth.'
