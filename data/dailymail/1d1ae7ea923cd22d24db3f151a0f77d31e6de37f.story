Samir Nasri showed no strain of failing to make France’s World Cup squad after holidaying with girlfriend Anara Atanes.

Atanes posted a picture of the couple on her Instagram account enjoying the delights of Dubai, as they walked along the beach.

The
 Manchester City midfielder was omitted from Didier Deschamps’ squad 
despite winning the Premier League title this term for the second time 
in three seasons.

All smiles: Samir Nasri (right) is on holiday with girlfriend Anara Atanes after being snubbed for the World Cup

Trouble: Atanes is facing legal action after criticising France coach Didier Deschamps

Apology: The model said she hadn't intended to offend French people, only the football management

Retiring? Nasri is considering his international future after being left out of the squad

The news angered Atanes who vented her anger on Twitter: 'F*** france and f*** Deschamps! What a s*** manager!'

And
 to reiterate her point further, the model then added: 'Incase u didnt 
read my tweet properly.... Ill repeat myself..... f*** FRANCE!!!!! And 
f*** Deschamps!

'Lets
 just get this straight! Im not mad i get my bf for 2 months.... I just 
think theres a level of respect to be had!' she tweeted, before later 
posting: '#ShouldOfBeenSpanish'

Deschamps has since filed a civil law suit Atanes her foul-mouthed rant despite her apologising later for her tirade.

It's
 the second time that the 26-year-old Nasri has been overlooked by his 
country for the World Cup, following his omission from the 2010 party in
 South Africa by then manager hen-coach Raymond Domenech.

The former Marseille and Arsenal star has since revealed he may retire from international football.

Discontent: Brighton-born Atanes has used her Twitter account to criticise France and post pictures of herself

Decision: Deschamps says he left Nasri at home because he would not be content to sit on the bench

Under-fire: Deschamps has been attacked by former players and pundits for his decision on Nasri

'It's a little bit hard to accept,' he told Sky Sports News.

'I
 need to take some time now to think about the national team because 
it's been twice now that they take away a World Cup from me.

'You can go around and ask any player if they're happy to be on the bench, nobody's going to say yes.

Delight: Atanes and Nasri were celebrating just a few days ago when City clinched the title

Success: Nasri has been a crucial part of City's title winning team this season

'I
 need to think a little bit during the holiday, what will be my future 
in the national team, because missing two World Cups is really hard for a
 player.'

While Nasri's absence was greeted with widespread surprise, the player himself said: 'I must confess, I knew before.

'Sometimes
 you have the feeling, when you call to speak to the manager and he 
doesn't want to speak to you, you know you're not going to go to the 
World Cup.

'It was a shock but I was prepared mentally. I'm okay.

'I respect his choice. He wanted to not pick me... good on him. I wish good luck to the French national team.'

Upon naming his provisional squad for this summer's showpiece in Brazil, Deschamps cited Nasri's international credentials.

He
 said: 'He (Nasri) has important status with Manchester City because he 
starts, which is not the case today in the France team.'

Back to basics: Nasri trained with his City team-mates on their post-season trip to Abu Dhabi

Popular: The Frenchman took part in a signing session for fans with team-mates Jovetic and Nastasic

In
 interviews leading up to his World Cup snub, Nasri was reserved, 
acknowledging that it was unlikely he was going to be picked.

'I think the dye is cast. I respect [Didier Deschamps'] choice. I'll watch the World Cup on TV,' he told Canal+.

'If starting games in a club like Manchester City and winning two titles isn't enough, too bad, I won't regret anything.'

France are in Group E at the World Cup this summer, and kick off their tournament against Honduras on June 15.
