Betrayed: Faiza Ahmed fled her home in Stockport after her marriage collapsed. She blames Lauren Booth, Cherie Blair's half-sister

Peace activist and Muslim convert Lauren Booth has been branded a home-wrecker by the woman who is still married to her new husband, Sohale Ahmed.

Faiza Ahmed has fled her home in Stockport, Greater Manchester, and taken her three children to  her brother’s house in Texas to recover from the collapse of her 16-year marriage.

The 37-year-old childminder and bilingual teaching assistant claims that Ms Booth – the half-sister of Cherie Blair –  has betrayed her newly acquired Muslim faith.

She accuses her of openly flirting with Sohale in front of her, spending the family celebrations of Ramadan and Eid with him, and marrying him in secret.

Speaking from the house in a gated community where she has taken refuge, Mrs Ahmed said:

‘Lauren destroyed my home. You can’t just put on a hijab and say you are a good Muslim woman – it’s about having boundaries with men, and love and respect for women.

‘She came into my house as my and my husband’s guest and did this under my nose. Her behaviour appals me, and other Muslim women  – the very people she professes to support – must now judge her.’

Her words are a major rebuke to Ms Booth, 45, whose Facebook announcement of her marriage was revealed by The Mail on Sunday last week.

It followed a jokey advert placed on the social networking site last year saying she was hunting for a husband, and that ‘Mossad agents, secret drinkers, CIA stooges, men who don’t pray and men who don’t pay’ need not apply.

Last night Mrs Ahmed told how her marriage to Sohale, 49, faltered as he devoted increasing amounts of time to promoting Muslim charity and fundraising events involving Ms Booth.

She knew they were business associates and Sohale described Ms Booth as his ‘sister’ – a Muslim term of respect.

Mrs Ahmed first met Ms Booth, who is now recognised across the United States, Asia and the Middle East as a public speaker, when she came to stay at the Ahmed family home in March 2012.

Mrs Ahmed said: ‘I cooked for her and then I stayed at home with the children while my husband and Lauren went out together. They came home late and I saw how open she was with him

‘She was joking around doing silly accents, Scottish and Asian. It was funny, but in the presence of a supposedly strange man, it was wrong.

‘This is not the way Islam tells a woman to be. Usually reverts [as Muslim converts are called] are even more strict and zealous. They see Islam in black and white, unlike those of us who are born to it.’

Later that evening, after demanding that her husband come upstairs to bed, Mrs Ahmed claims she was shocked to see him emerging from Ms Booth’s room.

‘He said he’d just popped in to collect something and brushed aside my suspicions but I was shocked and furious with him,’ she said.

‘They looked like more than friends or business associates. I was devastated. It was killing me. I told Sohale that even though I knew he was not going to stop seeing her, she was not allowed back into my house.

'He started going away on business for three and four days at a time, and sometimes being in London  at weekends.’

In
 April 2012, Sohale launched the Gaza fundraising charity Peace 2012, 
and signed up Ms Booth as a  co-director two weeks later.

The charity is registered to his parents’ home in Stockport and its stated aim is to provide food, water, houses and power to Gaza’s deprived areas.

Mrs Ahmed continued: ‘Ramadan was in August and I expected us all to be together, but Lauren was in Manchester. Sohale wanted her to stay with us and I said no way.

‘He responded by staying out almost all night with her, coming back perhaps at 1am and leaving again at 2.30am. I asked him what kind of charity fundraising went on at these times.

‘He ate his sehri [the pre-dawn meal] and his iftar [the meal which breaks the daily fast of Ramadan] with Lauren, which felt like he was spurning his real family.

‘On Eid Day, Lauren arrived home from the mosque with Sohale and other family members but no one warned me. I walked out of my kitchen and she was there in my front room in full make-up, dressed from head-to-toe in red, the traditional colour of a Muslim wedding dress. She looked like a bride.

‘She followed me back into the kitchen and said, “I am sorry I stole your husband!” She meant the time she’d spent with him over Ramadan but I told her flatly that I missed him and did not approve.

Later he spent all his time attending to her and they went off into the night. None of his family members said anything to him.’

Ms Booth later wed Sohale in a secret nikah, or religious ceremony. Such a ceremony is significant in faith terms but is not recognised as legal in Britain unless it takes place in another country where it is considered a legal way to marry.

Technically, Sohale’s faith permits him to take up to four wives but it is becoming more culturally acceptable to have just one.

Islamic law states a first wife should be informed about subsequent unions and while she cannot object, she should be given the opportunity to ask for a divorce.

But Ms Booth and Sohale kept their 
nuptials secret from Mrs Ahmed until February this year when she says he
 asked her for a divorce in a telephone call.

He also sent a text to say he was married.

Mrs
 Ahmed found out from Sohale’s brother that his bride was Ms Booth. The 
peace activist was formerly married to actor Craig Darby and they have 
two daughters.

She
 divorced him after he suffered serious brain injuries in a 2009 
motorbike crash which ended the idyllic life they had built for 
themselves in the Dordogne.

She announced her conversion to Islam in October 2010 saying: ‘It was probably an appreciation of Muslim culture, in particular that of Muslim women, that first drew me towards a broader appreciation  of Islam.’

She has since championed Muslim women’s rights, addressing an international conference in Malaysia in 2011 and seeking support on Facebook for a debate on polygamy.

Mrs Ahmed admits her relationship with Sohale had been troubled since 2010 – they underwent a trial separation that year.

However, she insists she never wanted
 a divorce. They were discussing a reconciliation and their physical 
relationship continued until March this year.

For now, Mrs Ahmed has enrolled her children – aged 13, 11 and six – at a school in Texas. She says: ‘There is so much mess and damage at home that I don’t know when I’ll be able to face going back.

‘Lauren has cost him his family, his friends, me and his children. All he has in his life is her. When he told me he loved me, he always used to say, “You are my first wife, and my last.” But he broke his promise.’

Neither Ms Booth nor Sohale could be reached for comment.
