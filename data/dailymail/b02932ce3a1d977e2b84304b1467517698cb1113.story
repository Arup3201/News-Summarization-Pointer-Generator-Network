A waxworks which has been described as Britain’s worst museum is facing closure because its elderly owners cannot find anyone else to run it.

The Louis Tussauds House of Wax in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, has cult status on the internet because so many of its models look nothing like the people they are supposed to represent.

Thousands of visitors still pay £5 each to visit the seaside attraction so they can mock the far from lifelike models of celebrities, sports stars and royalty.

Dud ringers: David and Victoria Beckham look very little like they do in real life

Jane Hayes, 82, and her husband Peter,
 85, who have run the museum since 1955 fear they will have to close the
 business if nobody wants to take it over.

Mrs Hayes said: 'In June this year my 
husband was taken seriously ill with pneumonia. We don’t want to retire 
but when your health starts to decline you have to think.

'It will be a shame as we’ve been here
 57 years, and it would be nice to make 60, but we’ve no family 
interested in taking it on.

Worst in Britain: The Queen and Prince Charles feature in the exhibition - but these waxworks aren't flattering

Terrible: Princess Diana's beauty is lost in this waxwork and, right, Prince William has a deathly palour

Odd looking: Royals Princess Anne and the Queen Mother, right, are barely recognisable 

'It’s softly, softly and we hope we will be able to continue as it’s also our home.'

The couple are now seeking planning permission to change the use of the museum from a waxworks to residential use.

But Mrs Hayes said they were also 
seeking a reduction in rates payable to Great Yarmouth Borough Council 
to make it a more viable business.

Going down (under): Kylie Minogue and Jason Donovan are showcased in the exhibition which is facing closure

TV fame: Presenter Michael Barrymore and Rowan Atkinson are just about recognisable

The museum has more than 150 models, 
mostly dating back to the 1970s and 1980s, including an 
unflattering Prince Charles, a dusky skinned Sean Connery and model 
Samantha Fox.

A model of Prince William has him in a casual sweater with a full head of hair while a model of the Queen looks less than regal.

The museum which employs three staff also includes a chamber of horrors and a collection of antique amusement machines.

Well known: Sarah Ferguson and Pope John Paul II are among the museum's 150 waxworks

Resemblance? Model Samantha Fox and Gary Lineker. Most of the stars date back to the 1970s and 1980s

Mocked: Eddie the Eagle Edwards and Michael Jackson are among the stars mocked by punters

Many of the models have been widely mocked on the internet, particularly by visitors on the review website TripAdvisor.

Some have even admitted travelling more than 120 miles to visit the waxworks so they can laugh at the models.

CatVonK,  who visited the museum in 
September, wrote on the site: 'This is well worth the £5 entry fee as 
its sooooo bad it's good.

Loved: War-time Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and right, Hitler. Some fans of the museum have even admitted travelling more than 120 miles to visit the waxworks so they can laugh at the models

Help: Name plates help visitors identify waxworks like footballer Gazza and right cricket star Ian Botham

'Some of the waxworks are 
unrecognisable and thankfully you are helped out with nameplates. The 
setting of the building is very dark and moody which really adds to the 
creepiness of waxworks.

'The torture chamber section was a bit
 unnerving as it was so dark and not helped that when you leave, you 
exit via a very spooky derelict arcade. If you love freaky things, this 
is superb. I'm so glad we went, it was brilliant fun :)'

Kelly M of Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire,
 who also visited in September, wrote: 'Well worth the 2 hour drive and 
entry fee for the laugh alone.

Ice stars: Jayne Torville and Christopher Dean are among the waxworks which have drawn crowds

Value? Snooker star Steve Davis and former footballer Kevin Keegan feature at the attraction which costs £5

'One or two are spot on (Mr Blobby) 
(The dead person in the dungeon) but without the nameplates etc you 
wouldn't have a chance of knowing who they were.

'I'm sure a lot of love and work has 
gone into the making of the waxworks but to know exactly who they are 
makes it a lot of fun.'

Another reviewer from Chelmsford, 
Essex, who gave it an ‘excellent’ rating said: 'What can i say,after 
reading all the reviews, my girlfriend and i visited last saturday, i 
have to agree with all the reviews, the smell, the dust , cobwebs what a
 joy.

Fame: Terry Wogan's face is a funny shade of pink and and right motorcycle road racer Barry Sheene

Sports: Decathlete Daley Thompson has a huge moustache and footballer Michael Owen is right

'The waxworks were a giggle all the 
way through, not sure what Micheal Jackson was supposed to be, and had a
 finger missing, Its a place you must visit, I proposed to my girlfriend
 in front of the royal family, she said yes through the fits of 
giggles'.

Mr Hayes described the museum as 
‘unfailingly popular’ in 2008 when he revealed that he was auctioning 
off 75 heads of models which had been taken off display.

But he cancelled the auction after newspaper articles poked fun at the models he was trying to sell for around £80 each.

Politics: Margaret Thatcher, left, and John Major is recognisable from his black rimmed spectacles

Giggles: Former tennis player Virginia Wade and former Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock 

Mr Hayes admitted at the time that some of his models were no longer recognisable.

He said: 'Some of them are too old and
 they do not resemble their subjects any more and obviously some 
visitors are far too young to remember them.'

In an interview in 2004, Mr Hayes 
said: 'We have never had any complaints and a lot of people give us the 
thumbs up and say they enjoyed it on the way out.

Stars: The Beatles and right Elvis Presley are among the music legends which feature in the display

Enduring: Noel Edmonds and Boy George. In the resort's heyday visitors had to queue to get in

'Yarmouth needs attractions and exhibitions and we are about the only good exhibition left here.'

Mr Hayes insisted that people's 
impressions of waxworks were always subjective and someone might 
consider a figure a good likeness while others might say it was not 
lifelike.

He added: 'Some are very good whereas 
some are a bit dated - but as they cost £1,000 each they have to
 have a good life and can't be replaced every year.'

In the resort's heyday in the 1960s, 
visitors had to queue to get in and went round the exhibition in lines 
of up to four abreast, he added.

The museum is closed for the winter season from tomorrow.

Popular: Louis Tussauds House of Wax in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk faces closure but has developed cult status

Attraction: House of Wax has been run by a husband and wife team for 57 years, and both are in their eighties

It was named after the great grandson of Madame Tussaud, the founder of the famous waxworks museum in London in 1835.

The Great Yarmouth museum’s website 
describes it as 'different from many wax museums, in that it remembers 
the stars and famous people as they were at their height of fame and 
influence.'

It adds: 'See your gallery of how 
people looked, how the passionate owners captured them at this time and 
preserved them for your enjoyment.  Many wax museum (sic) update their 
models to keep the realistic to reflect the current looks or styles.  

'If you are looking back to the 70s, 
so (sic) the stars as they were.  Nostalgia and memories.  Show your 
grand children  the stars and leaders during your generation and help us
 bring the museum to life.'
