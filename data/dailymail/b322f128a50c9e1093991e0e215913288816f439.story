A cross-bow wielding, 7-year-old Michigan girl has accomplished her mission to replace the prized 8-point buck trophy that hung on her bedroom wall before it was destroyed in a devastating fire.

Riley Skirkin was just 5 years old when she bagged the deer on her first time out with her father, who owns a store for hunters in St. Louis, Michigan. 

Now, the tenacious little huntress has a new trophy buck to hang on her wall and this one's an impressive 8-points, too. 

Sharp shooter: Riley Skirvin, 7, recently  killed this 8-point buck

Keeping watch: Riley peers through binoculars. She was able to kill the buck this year, after the head of a mounted buck she shot two years ago burned in a fire

'If there was one item I could have saved in that house it would have been that buck,' Riley's dad Ben Skirvin told MLive.com.

Before the loss, Riley wanted to get a doe this season. But according to her dad, the little girl said she wanted another 8-point to replace the one that burned up along with many of the family's other belongings May 21.

What's so shocking, is that she did just that, and with ease.

'It sounds funny but it seems like every time she goes out there's bucks are coming in to her,' Mr. Skirvin said.

Riley herself described to MLive just how it happened.

Huntress: The first buck Riley shot, at just 5 years old, was successfully killed with a crossbow

'My dad was looking around and then he saw a deer and it came up to the bait pile,' Riley said. 'I asked him what line to use (inside the scope on her crossbow) and he told me it was the top line.'

She pulled the trigger and put a bolt through both the animal's lungs.

'I was crying because I was so happy,” she said. “Very, very, really happy,' Riley told MLive.

Next year, Riley said she'll pursue her goal of bagging a doe, but laments: 'Bucks love me.'
