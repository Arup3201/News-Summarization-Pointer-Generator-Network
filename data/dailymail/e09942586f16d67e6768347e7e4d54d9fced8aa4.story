Empty glass bottles, cardboard boxes, discarded appliances and pieces of old wooden furniture lay piled up in the front yard to nearly half the height of the house itself.

A ginger cat crawls over and picks through plastic bags full of rubbish, old paint tins, a rusted wheelbarrow and a suitcase and the gates almost burst at the seams holding back the mountains of trash.

Located in Sydney's beachside suburb of Bondi, arguably one of Australia's most sought after areas at less than a kilometre from the iconic Bondi Beach, the house has not been lived in by its occupants for years.

This residence in the beachside Sydney suburb of Bondi has been and eyesore for locals for at least two decades

Mary, Liana and Elena Bobolas live on the property, but neighbours say they have not resided inside the house for many years 

But Mary, Liana and Elana Bobolas - known locally as the Bondi hoarders - still inhabit the front and back yards of the Boonara Avenue house, guarding their piles of trash as if it is treasure.

For at least two decades this property has caused trouble for infuriated neighbours who have to deal with the stench and the sight of rubbish inexplicably piled up in every spare space outside and presumably inside this home.

Although this is not the first time it's riled up people in the area, and the council cleaned the property just six months ago, some neighbours said the house is as bad as they've ever seen it, describing it as 'sickening' and 'filth'.

One woman, who lived nearby but had two friends living on the street said she had been completely baffled by the state of the home for years, and revealed that residents were outraged about the state of the place.

'I don't understand, I just don't understand it,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'It's unbelievable, it's outrageous.

'It's not fair for people who live nearby and want to sell property ... I just don't understand why the council can't do anything about it,' she continued.

Inexplicably, the side of the house and path leading down in to the backyard is much cleaner with hardly any items littering the ground

One neighbour said people often come and go from the house but the residents are sometimes not seen there for days at a time

Another woman who has lived next door to the rotting property - which has trees growing through the roof and holes in the walls - for the past 15 years said 'they haven't lived inside the house for years', and she believed there was no running water or electricity.

'They've got away with it for the last 20 years and they'll probably get away with it for another 20 years', she added, speaking of the very public squalor Mary and her two daughters were living in.

The woman said sometimes the Boboloas wouldn't been seen at their home for days at a time, while another added she had seen one of the family members arriving home with piles of new objects.

One neighbour described the Bobolas family as 'nocturnal' and said they found one of the women going through her rubbish

Two doors down from the squalid house another neighbour said the situation used to bother her, her husband and their small children but now 'it's just sad'.

'The council cleans it up every so often but there's an underlying mental issue ... Cleaning won't fix it, it's sad,' she said.

'The council have been brilliant, they send residents letters to keep us updated and hold meetings about the house.

The street is one of the most expensive in Bondi, located just a kilometre from iconic Bondi Beach

'(But) it's sickening because it's prime real estate,' the neighbour added.

The woman described the Bobolas family as 'nocturnal' recounting one evening when she returned home from an evening out to discover one of the women going through her rubbish bin, who when asked what they were doing simply said they were searching for something they had lost.

'My husband and I have joked about offering them $50,000 for the place', she added, before saying it did upset her that the home owners were quite clearly struggling with some form of mental illness.
