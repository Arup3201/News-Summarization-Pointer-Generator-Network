Larry Carroll and his daughter Savannah had always loved to sneak what they called 'stolen moments' - whether it was an unplanned trip to the playground or splitting a big chocolate cookie.

And when his 'Savvy' passed away unexpectedly and inexplicably on April 4, he realized how crucial these moments had been, and how he wanted another little girl to be as happy as she had been.

As Carroll, a writer and producer in Los Angeles, awaits blood tests that he hopes will shed some light on the cause of her death, he has decided to launch 'Savannah's Stolen Moments' - a fundraising campaign to pay for a hard-up family to give their own little girl a treat.

His initial aim of $10,000 has been far surpassed and people who have been touched by his heartbreaking story have donated more than $48,000.

'All I wanted to do was show my wife there was a reason to go on, that there was joy in the world and, even in the most brutal moments, the world is still a beautiful place with amazing people,' Carroll told Today, as he recounted his thoughts the first night after Savannah's death.

He hoped that the fundraising website would raise $10,000 that he and his wife Carrie would then gift to a family who wanted to treat their own daughter, but who could not necessarily afford it.

'I'm feeling very powerless right now,' Carroll wrote on the website. 'The only way I can handle this powerlessness, I figure, is with the power to give someone else joy.'

With the donations continuing to grow, the couple has not yet decided who will get the money.

'The only 3
 requirements are that they have a little girl, that they very clearly 
love her, and that they don't have the financial means to typically do 
this sort of thing,' he wrote on the site.

The donations beyond $10,000 will go towards a college fund for the girl, he told Today.

'We're going to sit in a mall, a 
coffee shop, a restaurant or playground watch people a little while 
until we find a girl that reminds us of Savannah,' Carroll said.

He also said he would love to meet up the little girl and her family after they go on their adventure so that he can see their photographs and hear their stories.

'Let us live vicariously through their joy and know that if Savannah had lived to that age, maybe we would have had that moment with her,' Carroll said.

Carroll and wife Carrie, who is 
eight-and-a-half months pregnant, said they are hoping to be able to 
find a girl when they come more to terms with their grief, perhaps later
 in the summer.

Happy memories: The parents are pictured together with Savannah on the day she was born

But for now, they are overjoyed with the messages that are flooding in for them over Twitter as parents share moments of joy with their own children and use the hashtag #StolenMoments.

'I will find a family somewhere - someone I
 have never met before and has no connection to anyone I know - and help
 them make a Stolen Moment,' Carroll wrote on the website.

'In the wake of this tragedy, I'm determined to create joy.'
