Brazil have returned to training as they look to put their nightmare World Cup exit behind them against Colombia in a friendly on Friday.

Dunga, who is returning for his second spell as Brazil manager, leads the Selecao into their first game since the semi-final 7-1 humiliation to Germany and 3-0 drubbing in the third-place play-off against Holland, which ended their home World Cup campaign back in July.

The five-time World Cup champions are training in Miami with talisman Neymar back in the fold following his severe back injury picked up against Colombia in their quarter-final World Cup clash in the summer.

The 22-year-old missed Barcelona's opening game of the season after picking up an ankle knock in training but returned to La Liga action on Sunday as a second half substitute as Barca won 1-0 at Villarreal.

In the United States Dunga has started the revolution of the Brazil side by only recalling 10 of the 23 players picked by Luiz Felipe Scolari at the World Cup.

Goalkeeper Julio Cesar, Barcelona right-back Dani Alves, Real Madrid's Marcelo and Tottenham midfielder Paulinho are amongst the biggest omissions from the squad, while captain Thiago Silva misses out through injury.

The 1994 World Cup winning captain believes the 10 players recalled can shake off the psychological blow inflicted by the Germany capitulation.

Return: Dunga has started his second stint as Brazil manager, replacing Luiz Felipe Scolari in the hotseat

'The important thing is the person. What happened on the pitch was without intention,’ Zuniga told globoesporte.com .

'It’s important now to think about the game between Colombia and Brazil.'

The Colombians, with Golden Boot winner James Rodriguez and Manchester United’s latest recruit Radamel Falcao in their ranks, will test Brazil’s resolve in Miami.

Colombia can exact revenge for the 2-1 quarter-final loss in Brazil however both sides will be looking to score psychological points before the South Amercian qualifiers for Russia 2018, which begin next year.

Dunga's new squad will also take on fellow South Americans Ecuador in New Jersey in another friendly on Tuesday.
