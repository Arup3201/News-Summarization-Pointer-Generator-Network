The 25-year-old daughter of Robin Williams has said there is 'no point' questioning why her father chose to take his own life six months ago, in the first time she has spoken publicly since the comedian's death.

Zelda Williams, speaking with NBC's Kate Snow on Thursday's TODAY show, said she has chosen not to dwell but to look to the future, focusing on charity that will help continue her father's legacy.

'It's going to take a lot of work to allow myself to have the sort of fun, happy life that I had, but that's important,' she said in the sit-down.

'People are finally starting to approach talking about illnesses that people can't immediately see. (My father) talked about his alcoholism. He joked about it, which I think you're supposed to.

She continued: 'It helped him not hide. If you have things that make you sad, express them to other people.

'I think it was important to him for people to talk about important things.

'He didn't like people feeling the things that were hard for them they should go through alone.

'And I think that's the big legacy, for me and for him and for my brothers.

'He, somehow, had an enormous amount of people in this world that he made feel they were a little less alone.

'People have their memories and they should enjoy them.

'The world keeps spinning, but it doesn't mean he was never on it.'

Williams, who had a long history of depression, committed suicide at his home in Paradise Cay in San Francisco Bay on August 11, 2014, aged 63.

Asked about the death of her father, Zelda said: 'There's no point questioning it and no point blaming anyone for it and there's no point blaming yourself or the world or whatever the case may be.

'Because it happened and you have to continue to move and you have to continue to live and manage.'

Following William's death, Zelda posted a photo to Twitter showing a new tattoo on her right hand of a hummingbird, which is considered a symbol of resilience.

However she further explained the meaning behind the inking. 

'Hummingbirds are fun and flighty and strange' she said in the NBC interview. 

'It's hard to keep them in one place and Dad was a bit like that. 

'Keeping a conversation in one moment was impossible with him.

'It's almost like trying to put a bag around a storm and hope it wouldn't blow away.

'Some days are going to be difficult (without him), and having a reminder that is permanently there is nice.'

On Friday, Zelda will accept the Noble Award that honors her father's humanitarianism and his work with the Challenged Athlete Foundation, a charity that provides prosthetics to disabled athletes. 

However Zelda would not speak about the current court battle over her father's estate. 

Williams had his eldest son, Zachary, 32, with first wife Valerie Velardi.

He later married Marsha Garces, Zachary's nanny, and had Zelda and Cody, 24, but they separated in 2008.

In 2011 Williams married his third wife, graphic designer Susan Schneider. 

In papers filed in December in San Francisco Superior Court, Susan Williams, says some of the late actor's personal items were taken without her permission and asks the court to exclude the contents of the Tiburon home that she shared with Williams from the jewelry, memorabilia and other items that Williams said the children should have.

The children counter that Susan Williams is 'adding insult to a terrible injury' by trying to change the trust agreement and rob them of the late actor's clothing and other personal items.

'The Williams' children are heartbroken that Petitioner, Mr. Williams' wife of less than three years, has acted against his wishes by challenging the plans he so carefully made for his estate,' attorneys for the children said in court papers.

James Wagstaffe, an attorney for Susan Williams, said Monday that his client was only seeking guidance from the court about the meaning of certain terms in the trust.

'This is not ugly,' he said.

'I would not say this is anticipated to be a highly contested proceeding.'

An attorney for the children, Allan Mayer, declined to comment.

Williams death was ruled a suicide that resulted from asphyxia caused by hanging.

Susan Williams has said the actor and comedian was struggling with depression, anxiety and a recent diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.

Williams had publicly acknowledged periodic struggles with substance abuse, and he had entered a substance abuse program shortly before his death. 

According to the coroner's report, his wife told an investigator that Williams did not go there because of recent drug or alcohol abuse, but rather to reaffirm the principles of his rehabilitation.

Williams' trust granted his children his memorabilia and awards in the entertainment industry and some other specific personal items, according to court documents. 

Susan Williams says that because he wanted her to continue to live at the Tiburon home, it makes sense that he intended only for his children to have the specific personal items he delineated that were kept at another home he owned in Napa.

'Any other interpretation would lead to Mrs. Williams' home being stripped while Mrs. Williams still lives there,' her attorneys wrote.

The children dispute that interpretation, saying there were no specific limits on the location of those items.

The two sides also disagree over items put in storage, watches Williams owned and his memorabilia.
