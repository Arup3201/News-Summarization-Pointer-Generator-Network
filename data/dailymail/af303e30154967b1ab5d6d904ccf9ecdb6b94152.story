Labour could try to cut the cost of the Trident nuclear deterrent to save money, Ed Miliband said yesterday – opening the way for a deal with the SNP.

He declared that he wanted to have the ‘least cost nuclear deterrent we can have’.

His comment raises the prospect of a coalition with the SNP, which has insisted it will not support any party that favours replacing the Trident nuclear missiles.

It also suggests that Labour could ditch one or more of the submarines which carry the weapons and are needing to be replaced.

Next year MPs will hold a final vote on whether to build a new generation of submarines in a £20billion ‘like for like’ replacement of Trident.

Labour’s position on Trident could be a key factor in any coalition deal after the May election – and the SNP could end up handing Mr Miliband the keys to Number 10 if it wins enough seats to prop him up and deliver a Commons majority.

The issue could also help Mr Miliband in negotiations with the Lib Dems and the Greens.

Labour leader: Ed Miliband declared that he wanted to have the ‘least cost nuclear deterrent we can have’

The current system involves four nuclear-powered submarines, with one armed boat always at sea, operating out of Faslane in Scotland.

Ed Miliband was asked about Trident during a question and answer session.

He said: ‘I want to see disarmament, but I want to see multilateral disarmament, I’m not in favour of unilateral disarmament.

‘What does that mean? That means we have got to have the least cost deterrent that we can have, and that’s my philosophy.’

The Liberal Democrats say ending round-the-clock patrols would allow the submarine fleet to be cut from four boats to three but the Tories attacked the idea of a ‘part-time’ deterrent.

Downing Street said David Cameron backed the like-for-like replacement of the ageing Vanguard class boats which carry the missiles.

A 2007 vote saw 161 MPs vote to oppose the renewal of Trident, including 95 Labour rebels.

Submarine-launched missiles are regarded as superior to land-based nuclear weapons because they are less vulnerable to a ‘first strike’.

Trident has been the UK’s nuclear deterrent since 1994. The missiles have a range of 7,500 miles and are accurate to a few feet.

They are carried by four submarines - Vanguard, Vengeance, Victorious and Vigilant.

On patrol, one submarine will carry 16 missiles, each with three warheads. Authorisation for using them can only come from the Prime Minister.

Former home secretary Charles Clarke, a critic of the current Labour leadership, questioned his party’s credibility on controlling public spending. 

He wrote in the Fabian Review magazine: ‘The public needs to support how their tax is spent. So Labour needs to acknowledge that spending which might easily have gained public support decades ago now needs serious re-evaluation.’
