A sunny day usually brings crowds to the beach – unless it’s your own private sandy spot on the coast.

Now there is a rare chance to snap up a Georgian manor house with its own secluded cove as well as stunning views, links with royalty and 30 acres.

The benefits will cost a pretty penny, however, as Redlap House in Devon is on the  market for £7.5 million.

Picturesque: Redlap House boasts seven bedrooms and a history bound up in illegal shipping activity

Private: The house's beach is only accessible from the property itself or the sea

Set away: The countryside residence (circled) is said to be the most expensive in the West County

For that, the new owner will enjoy 
seven bedrooms, four reception rooms, a 60ft indoor infinity pool and 
cliff-top  garden with hot tub.

There
 is also a guest house with a cinema, barbecue room and art studio. 
Parking is unlikely to be a problem with six garages and the garden 
rarely suffers frost, allowing tropical plants to flourish.

Yesterday,
 Martin Lamb, director of the Exeter office of estate agents Savills, 
said: ‘In 30 years, this is the only house I have sold with its own 
private beach. This is the best house I have sold. It is like the South 
of France but in Devon.”

In the last century, the estate played host to various royals on visits to Dartmouth to see the Fleet or Royal Naval College.

Its
 location, with access to the cove only via the house or sea, made it 
perfect for ships to drop off contraband. The Governor of Dartmouth, who
 owned the estate in the 18th century, was an active smuggler.

During his ownership the property was fitted with false walls to conceal contraband, and there are longstanding rumours of a secret tunnel linking the property to nearby Redlap Cove. However a tunnel has never been found, and the beach is accessed by steps leading down from the garden.

There are also rumours that George V visited the house, as he was frequently seen in the area while he was Prince of Wales in the earlier 20th Century.

Fancy a dip? The house has its own indoor pool which looks out over the sea

It has now been put on the market for 
'offers in excess of £7.5 million', making it one of the West Country's 
most expensive homes - though it is still a third of the price of a 
five-bedroom flat in One Hyde Park, London.

Savills, the agents marketing the Redlap House, today described the home as 'the finest coastal property in south Devon'.

Martin Lamb, director of the Exeter office, said: 'In 30 years this is the only house I have ever sold with its own private beach.

'It is in a cove on a very rugged coastline and it was perfect for ships to drop off contraband before arriving in Dartmouth. It is a wonderful family home set back from the cliff in tropical gardens. There is very rarely any frost and in the garden you can actually grow bananas.

Spacious: The 8,400sq/ft home also has a guesthouse which is almost as large again

Lavish: Redlap house's guest house is almost as large as the main building, and features its own cinema

Roomy: The property boasts a total of four reception areas

'It has always been the most expensive coastal home in Devon and is the best house I have sold. The holiday cottage, which is made from oak, has a stunning pool and overlooks the sea. It is like the south of France but in Devon.'

On top of the principal house, which measures 8,400sq/ft, there is also an additional guest house and pool complex which adds a further 7,000sq/ft.

The guest house boasts the 60-foot pool along with a 22-foot cinema, two bedrooms and a fully equipped barbecue room and art studio. There is also a staff flat, estate office and six garages and 30 acres of frost-free ground, which allows exotic plants to flourish.
