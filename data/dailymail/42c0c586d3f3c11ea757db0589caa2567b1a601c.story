Fitness guru Richard Simmons's close friends have lashed out at his spokesman's claims that he is not clinically depressed following a knee injury and the death of his pet dog, arguing: 'He is not ok.'

On Friday, Simmons's longtime spokesman, Thomas Estey, said the 66-year-old - who has not been seen in public for months - is 'sad' that the 'serious' injury to his knee has sidelined him professionally

However, he shot down earlier claims the star had become a recluse in his Hollywood mansion due to 'paralyzing depression' over his poor health and the death of his beloved Dalmatian, Hattie, aged 17.

'He is not clinically depressed or a shut-in or a recluse,' he declared.

But now, Simmons's friends have disputed Mr Estey's comments on his welfare, saying a number of reasons have led them to believe that 'something dire' has happened to the eighties guru.

Fitness guru Richard Simmons's (pictured) close friends have lashed out at his spokesman's claims that he is not clinically depressed following a knee injury and the death of his pet dog, arguing: 'He is not ok'

They told TMZ that the last contact any of them had with Simmons was on March 10 and even when the mother of one of his closest friends died a few months ago, he failed to contact her.

Furthermore, Simmons was reportedly close with actress Joan Rivers, who died from complications of routine throat surgery in September, yet did not attend her funeral. 

One friend, who did not wish to be named, told the celebrity news site: 'There is no way he wouldn't have gone to her funeral if he was ok.'

Simmons has also apparently abandoned his exercise studio, where he was regularly a fixture, and has failed to contact friends and family to inform them he is well.

'If Richard is really ok and is aware people are extremely concerned about him, he'd pick up the phone and tell them to relax. But he hasn't, and we're worried sick,' the friend said. 

Despite their concerns, Simmons's friends said they did not believe his knee injury, not Hattie's death, would have ultimately driven the star to cut himself off from the outside world.

On Friday, Simmons's longtime spokesman, Thomas Estey, shot down claims the 66-year-old had become a recluse due to 'paralyzing depression' over his poor health and the death of his Dalmatian, Hattie (pictured)

MailOnline talked to Simmons' housekeeper outside his Los Angeles (above) home on Thursday, and she said he is 'perfectly fine' and not depressed as previously reported. 'He's home and he's fine,' she claimed

On Saturday, Simmons tweeted: 'Thank you again for allllll your kindness.... remember to work out today!!!'

They believe there must be another - unknown - reason. 

In his statement to the New York Daily News on Friday, Mr Estey suggested that Simmons may be using a disguise to venture out in public without being seen.  

'If he needs to wear a disguise, he’ll wear a disguise,' he said. 'When you’re Richard Simmons, it’s not easy to get away with anonymity.'

He also addressed claims that Simmons is depressed over the death of Hattie - his last surviving Dalmatian who he reportedly took out with him in LA and treated like a child - and his knee injury.

According to a source, who spoke to TMZ, Simmons is in desperate need of a knee replacement and risks never being able to exercise again if he continues to avoid the routine procedure.

Earlier this week, Simmons took to Facebook (above) to thank fans for their 'outpouring of love and concern'

But Estey said: 'The truth is very simple, he has a knee injury, and it’s serious enough to keep him from doing what he loves most: exercising and motivating others.

'[But] he is not clinically depressed or a shut-in or a recluse. [Hattie] passed away a year and a half ago, it’s not the issue. And he hasn’t lost weight recently either.'

Simmons's housekeeper also denied claims that the star is suffering from 'debilitating depression', saying he is 'perfectly fine'.

Speaking to MailOnline, the housekeeper, named Teresa Reveles, who is allegedly tasked with turning friends or associates away when they come to visit him, said: 'He's home and he's fine.'

It comes as Simmons himself has taken to social media to thank fans for their 'outpouring of love and concern' following the surprising news of his well-being.

In a post on his official Facebook page he said: 'I am so touched by the outpouring of love and concern that I have received today. I have had a tough time dealing with this injury, as it is keeping me from doing what I truly love to do and that is to teach classes around the world.' 

And on Saturday, he tweeted: 'Thank you again for allllll your kindness.... remember to work out today!!!'

Reynold Gideon, who lives directly opposite, tells MailOnline exclusively that Simmons' housekeeper is adamant the sparkling fitness fanatic is merely 'resting'.

Mr Gideon confirmed that Simmons had issues with his knee but believes he's doing well and is most likely to be working on something new, he understands from many conversations with the gym guru's staff.

Mr Gideon explained: 'I think he's working on a new project, he's constantly recreating himself because the man has so much energy. He's a wonderful neighbor to have.'

Since his 80s heyday Simmons has constantly sought to regain his faded fame, and can be easily recognized in LA by his bushy hair

'He told me about a knee problem months ago but I've not seen him since so I don't know of any updates with it,' Mr Gideon explained.

One concerned neighbor pulled over their vehicle to ask MailOnline if the dazzling star had died, such is his absence in the community.

The woman, who declined to be named, enquired: 'Is he dead? We're all quite worried, nobody has seen him in months. It's so out of character but nobody knows what to do.'

An unidentified man arrived at the property to hand-deliver documents in an 8.5 by 11-inch brown envelope, received by Simmons' housekeeper, but refused to comment regarding the nature of his visit.

Simmons was last seen in public on January 11 at a charity event and has avoided his own famed studio 'Slimmons' in Beverly Hills for several months.

Since his 80s heyday Simmons has constantly sought to regain his faded fame, and can be easily recognized in LA by his bushy hair and trademark exercise shorts and tank top.

In 2011, the fitness guru had Dancing With The Stars viewers talking about his seemingly slimmed down build whist appearing on the show to coach celebrity contestant Chaz Bono.

The 63-year-old's smaller frame sparked speculation that something was awry, and perhaps he might even be ill - though this speculation was later quashed by his agent.

Simmons continues to run the Beverley Hills exercise studio, called Slimmons Studio, that he established in 1974. MailOnline reached out to Simmons for comment.
