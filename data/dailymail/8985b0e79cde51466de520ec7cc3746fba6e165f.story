Colin Furze - the eccentric inventor behind the X-men Wolverine claws, magnetic shoes, flamethrower and more - is at it again.

This time, he’s developed a machine to replicate the sound a fart makes, and pointed it towards France from Dover.

A valveless pulsejet was used to create the incredibly loud sound, which apparently was heard by two people in Calais - 26 miles (42km) away across the English Channel.

34 year-old Colin Furze from Lincolnshire has unveiled his latest creation. Using a pulse jet engine he created a contraption (shown) that was heard in France

A pulse jet engine is a type of engine in which the combustion happens in loud pulses and is fired by jets.

They can be made with few or no moving parts and can ignite a mixture of air with the majority of fuels available.   

Pulse jets are more commonly used in drones, for flying control line and 
radio-controlled aircraft as well as industrial drying and home heating 
equipment. 

The engines convert fuel into heat, making them perfect for boilers, for example. 

Boeing
 has a proprietary pulse jet engine technology called Pulse Ejector 
Thrust Augmentor (PETA), and plans to use pulse jet engines to lift 
military and commercial aircraft vertically from a standing position. 

In the video 34-year-old Furze and a crowd of fans gather to watch the device in action.

The father-of-one ignites the gas inside the jet which begins the combustion process inside the jet.

This creates a noise that Furze says ‘kind of sounds like a fart from a distance.’

He them calls up people in Calais to see if they heard the noise - which they apparently did.

The device used in the video is a valveless pulse jet.

A pulse jet engine is a lightweight form of jet propulsion.

Within a pipe it allows combustion to occur in pulses with little or not input from the user.

Furze directed his machine to Calais from Dover - a distance of 26 miles (shown). And after calling people in Calais he found that the sound had been heard

Furze created the valveless pulse jet by making a U-shaped pipe that has fuel pumped directly in a combustion chamber.

Once the fuel is ignited the engine roars to life.

‘The pulse jet is a wonderful thing, its simplicity is its best strength,’ Furze writes on his website.

‘As an engine it’s not great as most of the energy is wasted on heat and noise but for this task it’s that noise we need.’

Furze said his pulse jet was one of the largest that has been built.

In a previous video he shows how he built and tested the engine for the stunt.

This latest milestone follows some of his other crazy inventions such as Wolverine's claws from X-Men and magnetic shoes that let the wearer walk on the ceiling.
