One person has been killed and up to 100 are hurt after high winds knocked down a large tent near the Busch Stadium in St Louis.

A man died after suffering a heart attack during the commotion when a sudden storm blew through around 3.50pm yesterday, according to local reports.

The tent was attached to a sports bar where hundreds of people were celebrating the St Louis Cardinals' victory over the Milwaukee Brewers.

Disaster: One person was dead and 100 injured after a tent collapsed by a sports bar near the Busch stadium in St Louis this afternoon

Injury: Rescue workers take one of the storm victims to hospital after the tent collapse

Aftermath: An official surveys the scene after the accident, which involved 100 celebrating baseball fans

The St Louis Post-Dispatch reports it was not clear if the man who died was struck during the storm or went into cardiac arrest because of the shock.

The tent was set up next to Kilroy's 
Sports Bar, where St Louis Fire Chief Dennis Jenkerson said a few 
hundred people were celebrating the baseball team's win.

Kilroy's owner Art Randall said he 
thought a train fell off the track when wind gusts picked up the tent 
and debris flew across the area.

'We all ducked for cover,' he said. 'Everything was going sideways. I had metal chairs ripping across the beer garden.'

Hazard: Kilroy's bar owner Art Randall said things 
were flying through the air sideways and metal chairs were being flung 
across the beer garden by the storm

Devestating: Emergency officials said 17 people were taken to hospitals with injuries ranging from minor to very serious

Witnesses said the storm lasted several seconds and estimated the winds were between 60 to 80 mph.

After its collapse, patrons were struck with metal poles and electrical wires.

Emergency officials said 17 people were taken to hospitals with injuries ranging from minor to very serious, including the man who died.

Janece Friederich was in the parking lot at Kilroy's when she saw dark clouds approaching. Before she could get out of the car and go into the bar, she saw the tent fly into the air.

'It looked like it just got ripped out because it ended up 100 feet in the air on top of the railroad tracks,' Ms Friederich said.

Mr Randall suggested that the victim had died after being struck by lightning, and said that other patrons had tried to administer CPR but were unsuccessful.

'At some point in that five seconds, we were 
getting lightning strikes, and apparently one of our customers got hit 
by lightning right in the middle of the dance floor,' he said.

Blown away: The tent was left resting against a nearby train trestle

Temporary: The tent had been set up to accommodate fans wanting to celebrate after the Cardinals game

Celebration: But the happy afternoon took a tragic turn thanks to the intervention of high winds

KSDK reported that fire officials said five people were in critical condition and 100 people were treated at the scene.

St Louis Fire Chief Dennis Jenkerson blamed the incident on the flimsy construction of the tent.

'We don’t like this type of building, if you will,' he said. 'This gives us nightmares. And as you can see, it caused one.'

Several bars and restaurants in the area around Busch Stadium set up tents throughout the baseball season to handle overflow crowds - Cardinals games are typically sellouts, or close to it.

In addition to the baseball game, about 20,000 fans were downtown Saturday for a St Louis Blues hockey playoff game.

'Nightmare': Local fire chief Dennis Jenkerson described the destruction

Building Commissioner Frank Oswald said Kilroy's was granted a tent permit on April 11 and it passed inspection a couple of days later.

Mr Oswald said the city requires tents to be able to withstand winds up to 90 mph, but he declined to speculate on whether Kilroy's could face discipline.

He cautioned that patrons need to understand that a tent is not a safe place to be in bad weather. St Louis had been under thunderstorm watches and warnings for some time prior to the incident at Kilroy's.

'Tents are temporary structures,' Mr Oswald said. 'They are certainly not designed in any stretch of the imagination to handle weather like this.'

About two hours after the incident at Kilroy's, tornado sirens blared throughout the city after a funnel cloud sighting.

There were several reports of tree damage, power lines down and damage from hail that in some parts of the region reportedly was as big as tennis balls. By late evening, about 2,600 Ameren UE electrical customers were without power in the city.
