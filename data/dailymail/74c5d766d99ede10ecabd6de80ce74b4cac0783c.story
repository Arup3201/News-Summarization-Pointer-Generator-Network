A mixed martial arts fighter known as War Machine started laughing in court when the woman he allegedly beat and sexually assaulted described her injuries.

Jonathan Paul Koppenhaver, 33, was chided by the judge after smirking during testimony from Christy Mack, his porn star ex-girlfriend.

Mack, 23,  was describing the alleged attack at her Las Vegas home in August this year, which left her with 18 broken bones, a broken nose, missing teeth, a fractured rib and a ruptured liver.

She had just been asked 'was there sexual violence?' by a prosecutor - to which she replied 'yes' - when Koppenhaver started laughing, according to KLAS-TV. 

A prosecutor who saw Koppenhaver's reaction asked that court records note him 'laughing and shaking his head'.

The fighter's lawyer tried to object, but the judge at Clark County District Court replied 'I watched him laugh.'

At the hearing today the judge also added two felony charges to the case against Koppenhaver, including one alleging he raped Christy Mack one more time than previously alleged.

Mack and her friend, Corey Thomas, testified Koppenhaver beat them when he arrived at Mack's house early Aug. 8 and found them together.

Injured: Mack, who has agreed to be identified in reporting of the case, was left with broken bones and a ruptured liver by the attack

Objection: A prosecutor asked that the court record that Koppenhaver was laughing and shaking his head as Mack said that he sexually assaulted her 

Koppenhaver's lawyer, Brandon Sua, says he'll plead not guilty at his arraignment next week.

In a note Koppenhaver wrote in prison, published by TMZ, he accused Mack of preparing 'painful lies' to tell in court.

He has also described many of the accusations as 'B.S. fantasy charges' in a note written before he attempted suicide. He has claimed Mack is pursuing the charges to gain publicity and make money.

Cuffed: Koppenhaver has yet to enter a plea over the alleged attack, but his said he will plead not guilty
