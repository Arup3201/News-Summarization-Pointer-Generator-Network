An American rapper who is thought to have been killed in Syria while fighting for ISIS was a school friend of an Islamic convert who joined the terrorist group al-Shabab, it has emerged.

It was confirmed by a state official on Tuesday that Douglas McArthur McCain travelled to Syria to join a militant group, most likely the Islamic State, and had been killed fighting over the weekend.

Now it has been revealed that McCain, who had most recently lived in San Diego but grew up outisde Minneapolis, attended the same high school as Troy Kastigar, who died in 2009 aged 28, while fighting for al-Shabab in Somalia.

Both men were said to have struck up a close friendship with each other during their time at  Robbinsdale Cooper High School in the town of New Hope, where McCain graduated in 1999.

Kastigar's mother Julianne Boada told the NY Daily News: 'They both were sort of searching, it seemed like.

'It’s just like who would ever have predicted this outcome. For Troy, he was so bright again. It was really a path that was so wonderful to him.

'They had quite a few friends in school who were Somali immigrants and an African American friend whose family was Muslim.'

It has been reported that Kastigar converted to Islam three years before he travelled to Somalia and appeared in a video where he was lauded as one of the 'Minnesotan martyrs'.

Smiling and laughing in the footage, 
Kastigar called his battle experiences 'the real Disneyland' and urged 
other Muslims to come and 'take pleasure in this fun.'

He was killed in 2009 in the Somali capital Mogadishu, according to the video.

It is unknown when the pair last had contact.

It
 comes following the death of McCain, after pictures of his body, 
showing his distinctive neck tattoo, and his passport were shared by the
 Free Syrian Army.

Minnesota criminal courts records show McCain had a few minor traffic offences, including two instances where he was convicted of giving police a false name or ID in 2003 (left) and 2008 (right)

His cousin Kenyata McCain, told the Minneapolis Star 
Tribune that she had spoken to him as recently as Friday and 'he was 
telling all of us he was in Turkey.'

'I know that he had strong Muslim beliefs,' she told the newspaper. 'But I didn't know that he was in support of ISIS. I didn't think he would be.'

At an apartment complex in New Hope, Shelly Chase remembered McCain as a friendly boy who welcomed her nine-year-old son, Isaac, when the Chase family moved in some two decades ago.

Even though McCain was a few years older, the boys used to lift weights, hit punching bags and play basketball.

Both Shelly Chase and her son, now 28, fought back tears as they talked about McCain.

'I'm holding in the tears, I really am, because this is hard. He was a good kid,' Shelly Chase said.

'Someone must have persuaded him.'

Isaac Chase said he had always looked up to McCain. Chase joined the military in 2007, and said before he left, he knew McCain was running into trouble, sometimes smoking marijuana at the park.

Minnesota criminal courts records show McCain had a few minor traffic offences, including two instances where he was convicted of giving police a false name or ID.

'I don't know if he was just lost or what,' Isaac Chase said. 'He was a good person at heart.' 

The
 Free Syrian Army claims to have found McCain's body after a fight with 
ISIS. McCain's American passport was found in his pocket along with $800
 in cash

He said he last talked to McCain in 2008 when he was home on leave. McCain told Isaac he was proud of him, and he was trying to straighten out his own life, Isaac said.

A 26-year-old aid worker who was kidnapped from Syria last year has been confirmed as the third hostage held captive by the Islamic State (aka ISIS).

The terror-group has demanded a $6.6million ransom for the woman, as well as the release of imprisoned neuroscientist Aafia Siddiqui, according to reports.

The hostage's family has asked for her name not to be released for fear of her safety.  She is the third of at least four hostages held by ISIS, including executed photojournalist James Foley.

The ransom was revealed on Monday, at a press conference held on behalf of Siddiqui's family, who are trying to distance themselves from ISIS.

It was also confirmed through a close friend of the unidentified hostage's family. 

News of the ransom comes just a week after the group beheaded Mr Foley in a savage propaganda video posted online.

FBI Director James Comey said in June that roughly 100 people had left the United States to join the conflict in Syria.

Comey said the terrorism threat of today 'has spread, metastasized. ... The traveler problem makes it even more difficult, because the people going to Syria are not from any particular demographic. They're not from any particular part of the United States.'

Comey's remarks came during a visit to the FBI's field office in Minneapolis, which has struggled in recent years with several young Somali-Americans leaving the United States to join the terror group al-Shabab in Somalia.

FBI spokesman E.K. Wilson said agents continue to investigate reports that several young men have left the Minneapolis area for overseas locations, including Syria.

'We have done extensive outreach recently, as we have the last seven years, but we've had a concerted effort ... over the last few months,' he said, as reports of travel to Syria surfaced.

Friends of McCain were incredulous after being told of the circumstances of his death.

'He was a goofball in high school,' a classmate told NBC. 'Doug was a fun guy to be around. Played basketball, joked a lot, had a small sense of humor. Got along with most … Wasn't the best athlete, but liked to play.”

Another friend who would go to teen nights at the YMCA with McCain called him a 'good guy who loved his family and friends.

'He would be the light in anyone's darkness. He always made you smile with his goofy self.'

After graduating in 1999, he stayed in Minnesota for some time according to his criminal record.

He was arrested in 2000, at the age of 19, for disorderly conduct and then again in 2006 for obstruction. He was convicted on both charges.

According to his Twitter, he converted to Islam around 2004, referring to himself as 'Duale ThaslaveofAllah' and his online posts become much more fervent.  

ISIS are an extremist group currently invading Iraq from Syria in an attempt to establish a caliphate. Last week they brutally beheaded American journalist James Foley in a video posted online

Among his likes on Facebook are the 'Quaran and Hadith' and 'The Black Flag' as well as Pizza Hut and the Chicago Bulls

At some point he traveled to Sweden where he performed sometimes as a rapper.

Kevin Kohlin knew him there and says they often played basketball together and chatted about hip-hop music.

'We would talk just a little bit about religion,' Kohlin added. 'He respected my Christianity.'

McCain appears to have moved back to San Diego recently where he worked at a Somali restaurant for sometime.

An acquaintance at the restaurant said he was normal and 'open-minded' and just 'wanted to be a good Muslim'.

In September 2010, he posted an ominous image that had the caption, 'They are coming back soldiers of Allah.'

It appears that McCain crossed into Syria from Turkey in the last few months. He tweeted to another ISIS fighter in June his intention to join them in 'r town' - mostly likely meaning Raqqa

News of McCain's death comes as ISIS has demanded a $6.6million ransom for an American aid worker held hostage 

His MySpace profile contains similar messages, with photographs of McCain with the Quran captioned, 'The Quran is all I need in this life of sin.'

In April, McCain retweeted an English translation of a speech given by an ISIS spokesman and soon after that was spotted in Turkey - a common entryway into Syria.

McCain attended high school in Minnesota where he played for the basketball team, and once performed as a rapper

Three months ago, McCain met with friends at a Burger King in Istanbul where they talked about the NBA

In May, McCain began praising the decade anniversary of his conversion to Islam and began to message and friend self-declared jihadis online.

On June 9, he tweeted to another ISIS fighter that 'I will be joining you guys soon'.

He also asked if another jihadist had made it to 'r town' - most likely referencing the ISIS-stronghold city of Raqqa.

Later he posted: 'I'm with the brothers now'.

His last tweet was on August 19.

Several of McCain's friends and family members have taken to Facebook to mourn his loss. 

His younger sister  posted a collage of three pictures with her brother, and wrote a brief memorial.

'I really don't understand why and how and I have no words, I never thought this will be the way we say goodbye. You where my oldest brother, my biggest headache, the one I argue with the most, my words when I needed you to be. I can hear you now saying "lele guess what, I'm awesome" and that big brother you are. This is absolutely unreal to me I love you big brother.'
