Angry taxi drivers caused major disruption on Westminster's roads today in a protest over their ban from dedicated Olympics traffic lanes.

Tourists in Parliament Square were greeted with blaring horns as more than 200 black cabs arrived shortly before 2pm.

The demonstration was organised as pictures revealed that markings on the controversial lanes are already becoming worn - 10 days before the Games begin.

The route in Park Lane was only painted a week ago, but already the markings are beginning to fade outside the Dorchester Hotel.

Use of the lanes will be restricted to Olympics officials, athletes and other approved vehicles.

The routes have been nicknamed ‘Zil lanes’ after the limousines used to ferry communist leaders in specially reserved lanes from the Kremlin during the Soviet era in Russia.

Restrictions do not come into force in central London until July 25, but taxi drivers have already made their grievances known.

Jonathan Myers, of the United Cabbies group union, said: 'There will be no access to these lanes for any traffic apart from the Olympics family.

'Taxis are excluded, which is unacceptable and wrong. This is a working city and we need to get around and do our job.'

A key road junction on access routes to the Olympic mountain biking course will not be completed in time for the Games.

Roadworks have overrun for almost two months at Sadlers Farm, where visitors are expected to travel on their way to the course at Hadleigh Farm Country Park in Essex.

Some 40,000 spectators are expected to attend the mountain biking events and contractors had hoped to complete the Olympic improvement works at the junction in Basildon, Essex, in time.

But councillors have decided to abandon the work to avoid huge tailbacks during the competitions.

The junction links two key routes of London - the A13 and the A127.

A spokesman for Essex County Council said: 'Following the Olympics, contractors will need to return in September to carry out final works.

Mr Myers dismissed as 'complete rubbish' claims London athletes would be delayed and potentially miss events without the dedicated lanes.

He said officials' 'modelling was all wrong'.

He said he hoped up to 1,000 cabbies would take part in a demonstration in the square this evening, which could affect rush-hour traffic.

Transport for London said the taxi protest was 'completely irresponsible'.

John Mason, the transport body's director of taxi and private hire, said: 'We have worked tirelessly with groups that represent the majority of hard working taxi drivers to provide cabbies with as much access to the lanes as possible.

'Through dialogue which started in 2009, TfL has secured concessions specifically for taxi drivers, including the use of turns along the Olympic route network that were initially banned for all traffic except buses, as well as access to a number of kerbside Games lanes to pick up passengers.

'We have informed taxi drivers that any such demonstration is completely irresponsible and would only disrupt the travelling public - the very people taxi drivers are supposed to serve.

'We strongly urge taxi drivers to ignore calls to join these unnecessary protests and instead show why they are regularly voted the best in the world.'

A Metropolitan Police spokeswoman said officers were aware of the protest and put in place 'an appropriate policing plan'.

The protest happened only a day after the opening of the first Games lane - between junctions 3 and 2 on the M4.

Its introduction caused confusion for commuters travelling on approach roads into London.

Drivers faced long tailbacks as many struggled to understand if they could use the freshly painted lanes or not.

A YouGov poll has found that, with 
the opening ceremony only 10 days away, more than half of Londoners have
made no alternative travel plans for the Games.

The
research, commissioned by used car website Motors.co.uk, suggested that
many commuters had paid little attention to publicity campaigns.

Fifty-six per cent of respondents said they had not changed their plans.

And
more than half of Facebook and Twitter users surveyed said the 
high-profile taxpayer-funded Get Ahead of the Games campaign had made no
difference to them.

Phill 
Jones, commercial director of Motors.co.uk, said: 'While Londoners are 
undoubtedly excited about the Olympics, the results reflect that chaos 
may be looming, as many are unconvinced by the city’s ability to handle 
additional volumes of people on public transport and roads.

'London’s
public transport and road systems are likely to be hubs of bedlam in 
the coming weeks, as commuters and tourists try to go from A to B.
