President Obama today presented the Medal of Honor to a hero of the Korean War, an Army chaplain from Kansas who provided spiritual and medical aid to soldiers in the conflict.

In a moving ceremony in the East Room of the White House, the president awarded the nation’s highest military award to a nephew of Capt. Emil Kapaun, who died in captivity more than 60 years ago, saying that the Kansas native was ‘an American soldier who didn’t fire a gun, but who (carried) the mightiest weapon of all: the love for his brothers so powerful that he was willing to die so that they might live.’

The Roman Catholic priest, who even in a North Korean POW camp cut up his blanket to make socks for his fellow prisoners, died in captivity in 1951 at the age of 35 at the prison camp in Pyoktong, near the Chinese border.

He had been a prisoner for six months. According to the Washington Free Beacon, three or four prisoners would die every night at the prison camp. The unfortunate prisoners of Pyoktong were fed less than 500 grams of millet each day.

The fallen hero was recognized for helping to carry an injured American for miles as Chinese captors led them on a death march, and for risking his life to drag the wounded to safety while dodging explosions and gunfire.

In November 1950, after Chinese soldiers overran U.S. troops near Unsan, Kapaun defied orders to evacuate, knowing it meant he would most certainly be captured.

He pleaded with an injured Chinese officer to call out to his fellow Chinese to stop shooting, an act that spared the lives of wounded Americans.

As Kapaun was being led away, he came across another wounded American in a ditch and an enemy soldier standing over Sgt. Herbert Miller, ready to shoot. Kapaun pushed the enemy aside and helped Miller as they were taken captive.

They arrived days later, by foot, at the village in Pyoktong, where a POW camp eventually was established.

'I can't imagine a better example for all of us, whether in uniform or not in uniform, a better example to follow,' Mr Obama said after presenting the award to Capt. Kapaun’s nephew, Ray Kapaun, adding that they were marking the Roman Catholic priest’s valor. 

At the camp, Kapaun cleaned others' wounds, convinced them to share scarce food, offered them his own clothes and provided spiritual aid and comfort. On Easter in 1951, he defied his communist captors by conducting Mass with a makeshift crucifix.

The president said Kapaun showed that a touch of the divine exists even in hellish situations.

'Father Kapaun's life, I think, is a testimony to the human spirit, the power of faith, and reminds us of the good that we can do each and every day regardless of the most difficult of circumstances,' Mr Obama said.

The chaplain's nephew, Ray Kapaun accepted the medal from Mr Obama on his uncle's behalf. Emil Kapaun's parents and his only sibling, a brother, are deceased.

'A country boy from a small town in Kansas just received the nation's highest award for valor. That boy was my uncle.'

'I don't think the enormity of what occurred today will actually hit me until my wife and I are heading home from this experience,' Ray Kapaun, 56, told the Associated Press after the ceremony.

He gave credit to fellow POWs who 
spent years lobbying for the Medal of Honor for the uncle he came to 
know only through stories others told.

'I
didn't know him. We never met,' Ray Kapaun said. 'If not for these men I
may have not had such a lifelong personal relationship with my uncle.'

He said the medal would be given to Pilsen, Kansas, where Emil Kapaun's former parish is located.

A separate effort also is underway seeking another honor for Kapaun: sainthood.
