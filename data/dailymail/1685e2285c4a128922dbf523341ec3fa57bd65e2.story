Unemployed father Adam Pitt has been snubbed for more than 500 jobs - despite writing speeches for United Nations General Secretary Ban Ki-Moon.

He has been turned down by companies for being 'over-qualified' or 'under-experienced'  after spending two years with the UN in Beijing.

Adam, 29, said: 'Job agencies just aren't interested, most of them just don't call back. I have to think positively and remember my skills are valuable.

Looking for work: Unemployed Adam Pitt wrote speeches for the UN leader but has been rejected for jobs as being 'over qualified'

'I've applied to big companies, small 
companies; the smaller places think I'm over-qualified, whereas the 
larger companies say I'm under-experienced.

'I feel like I can't find a job anywhere doing anything.'

Adam, from Chaddesden, Derbyshire, has only been asked for five interviews after spending seven hours on applications.

He studied international relations at the University of Derby and moved to China in 2010 to work in marketing and teach English.

Job hunt: Adam Pitt with his wife Karla and one-year-old son Jacob: He has applied for more than 500 positions

Granted an internship with the UN in Beijing, he was taken on full-time and eventually became a speech writer.

Adam said: 'Anything produced in English came through me. I wrote speeches for Ban Ki-Moon which was interesting because he doesn't like more than about ten words in a sentence.'

One of the speeches Adam wrote for the UN supremo was used in an address about China-UN relations and the country's sustainable development.

He was also involved with the Rio+20 social media campaign which engaged a millions of people across the globe.

But when he returned to Derby last January with wife Karla, 25, and their one-year-old son Jacob he was stunned potential employers did not seem to appreciate his role working for one of the world's best-known leaders.

Adam is expecting his second child with Karla and is desperate to land work, but the fruitless job hunt is beginning to take its toll.

'Not knowing why people aren't getting back to you and you get no feedback it makes it very hard to gauge where you go next,' he said.
