Killed by cattle? Father-of-one Lee Jameson's body was found partially beneath his quad bike in the middle of a field in County Durham

A farmer may have been killed by hungry cattle he was trying to feed, an inquest has heard.

Father-of-one Lee Jameson’s body was found partially beneath his quad bike in the middle of a field on Westgate Fell, near Daddry Shield, in Weardale, County Durham.

Accident investigators believe that cattle had charged at the quarter-tonne bike that was carrying bales of hay, causing it to topple and trap Mr Jameson underneath it while it was still running.

The 32-year-old farm worker had been missing for several hours when he was found around 4.30pm under the Kawasaki vehicle, on September 21 2011.

The quad bike was discovered upright by Mr Jameson’s employer, James Nattrass, who went to look for him when he had not heard from the worker for several hours.

Mr Nattrass said: 'The bike was upright with the engine still running. Mr Jameson was half underneath the bike.

'I realised he was dead straight away.

'On the day of the accident he came to see me about 10.30am and then he took two hay bales to feed the cattle in the field.

'He’d have got off the bike so he could throw the straw about the field for the cows.

'I tried to ring him during the day and got no response and I found him about 4pm. I found the bike upright with the engine running.

'I can only come up with two possible explanations as to what happened.

'It’s possible something happened to him when he got off the bike and he crawled under it to get away from the cows.

'He may have being knocked unconscious and the cows then pushed the bike over him as they tried to get the straw.'

He added that the cattle 'were not aggressive per se.'

He said: 'They are a big bunch and a potential danger if they knocked you over.'

Mourning: Pictured is the farmer's funeral. Accident investigators believe that cattle had charged at the quarter-tonne bike that was carrying bales of hay intended to feed them, causing it to topple and trap him underneath

Goodbye: The farmer, whose funeral cortage is pictured, leaves a young family. A second theory is that he crawled under the bike to get away from the cows

PC Michael Baxter, of the police’s collision investigation unit, said: 'It seems likely that Mr Jameson went to the front of the vehicle for whatever reason.

'He tried to get out of the cows’ way and it’s more than likely the cows pushed the bike forward.'

Health and Safety Executive inspector Jonathan Wills, who led an investigation into the death, agreed it seemed possible that the cows may have pushed the bike forward killing Mr Jameson.

The Health and Safety Executive has issued a prohibition notice on the Nattrass farm for failing to ensure its quad bike riders wore protective head gear.

The jury at the inquest held in Crook, County Durham, by coroner Andrew Tweddle, returned a verdict of accidental death.

Mr Jameson leaves behind a partner, Diane Thomson and their two-year-old son, George, as well as parents Janet and John.
