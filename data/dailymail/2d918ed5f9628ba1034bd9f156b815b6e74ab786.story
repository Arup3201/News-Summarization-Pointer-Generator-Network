David Cameron admitted yesterday he will not try to cap the number of EU migrants who can come to Britain to work.

Despite figures showing a surge in Romanian and Bulgarian migrants has pushed their numbers to nearly 200,000, the PM insisted free movement of labour was an ‘important’ right.

He said he supported the ‘freedom to apply for a job, to go and work, in another country'.

Romanian immigrants set up camp at Marble Arch, London. Police say the Romanians are being brought in by coach and dropped off at Marble Arch, even though it's not an official stop. About 60 rough sleepers have now set up camp there

Instead, Mr Cameron said he would try to curb ‘benefit tourism’ from the EU as part of his renegotiation of Britain’s membership ahead of a planned referendum in 2017.

Yesterday Oxford University migration experts suggested the number of Romanian and Bulgarian workers living in Britain may have increased by 30,000 compared - a rise of 25 per cent compared with the same period last year.

That would mean the population of migrants from those two countries in the UK was nearly 200,000 when students and dependents are included.

Mr Cameron also gave a ‘cast-iron’ guarantee that he will hold an In/Out referendum on Europe in 2017 if he is re-elected next year. He said that he will refuse to form a Coalition or lead a minority government unless he can ensure the referendum will go ahead.

And he indicated that he could urge Britain to leave the EU if his attempt to claw back powers fails.

He told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show he would not ‘sit on the fence’, adding: ‘We have the referendum whether or not I have successfully negotiated. I think the negotiation will be successful.

Dr Carlos Vargas-Silva from the Migration Obseratory said he expected to see a 'big increase' in immigrant numbers. 'We would expect at least 30,000 more. It is difficult to predict, but that would be the minimum you would expect,' he said

Mr Cameron said that he wanted curb EU migrants’ access to benefits, with a longer waiting period before people to claim and an end to making child benefit payments to children living abroad.

He also said he wanted Britain to be excluded from the EU’s historic drive towards ‘ever-closer union’ - a move that will require a change to the EU’s founding Treaty of Rome.

The Prime Minister also repeated his view that future countries joining the EU, such as Turkey, should have to wait far longer before their citizens could come to the UK to work.

Government sources have floated the idea in the past that ministers could try to impose an annual cap on EU immigration - a move that would lead to a furious stand-off with Brussels.

But Mr Cameron yesterday indicated that he had no plans to limit EU migrant labour - the issue credited with driving support for Ukip.

He said: ‘I think free movement within the European Union is important, but it needs to be returned to the original concept, which was the freedom to be able to go and work in another country. Now many British citizens go and work in other European countries. Other European citizens come to work here.'

His comments on immigration will disappoint those Tory MPs calling for an end to free movement and the repatriation of border powers from Brussels.

This week official immigration statistics are expected to confirm a spike in numbers since border controls were abolished in January.

Dr Carlos Vargas-Silva from the Migration Obseratory said he expected to see a ‘big increase’ in numbers.

‘It is almost certain that we are going to see an increase in that number from the first quarter of 2013 to the first quarter in 2014.

‘We would expect at least 30,000 more. It is difficult to predict, but that would be the minimum you would expect.'

It appears impossible for ministers to hit their pledge to cut net migration to the ‘tens of thousands’ by the end of the Parliament.

The figure fell to around 150,000 in 2012 but leapt again last year to 212,000 driven by the arrival of workers from southern European states in economic turmoil.
