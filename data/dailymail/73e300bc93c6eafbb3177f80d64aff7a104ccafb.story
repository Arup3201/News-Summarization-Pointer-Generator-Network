Tragedy: Isabella Rodriguez (pictured) suffered fatal injuries when a TV that sat on top of a dresser fell on her

A three-year-old twin girl has been killed after being crushed by a falling television as she played in the family garage.

Several other items from a dresser also landed on Isabella Rodriguez at the home in Encinitas near San Diego, California.

The child's mother, Silvia Burrell-Rodriguez, 20, said her husband was taking Isabella and her twin sister, Alejandra, outside to play and Isabella went into the garage at 6pm on Tuesday evening.

Moments later the large and heavy television had fallen on her and inflicted fatal injuries.

'It wasn't even five seconds when someone runs in and tells me that she's on the floor bleeding,' she said.

'I called 911 but the operator doesn't understand me, I got really frustrated. I picked her up with my hands and I ran to the car.'

Isabella was rushed to the nearby Scripps Encinitas Hospital.

She was then airlifted to Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego where she later died.

The Sheriff’s Department has indicated that an investigation is being conducted with child abuse and homicide teams.

Mrs Burrell-Rodriguez has since returned to the garage where Isabella was hurt, and was seen shoving the dresser where the TV once sat.

'The furniture had been there for three years already. In those three years they always played in that garage and nothing bad had happened to them, nothing,' she said.

Heartbroken mother Silvia Burrell-Rodriguez says her daughter was only alone for five seconds before the TV fell

'I just want to tell everybody just keep an eye out on their kids, every second that passes by because it doesn't need a minute or five, it could happen in one or two seconds.'

Hospital officials said today more children than ever being injured by toppling TVs and other furniture.

Three months ago 16-month-old Natalie Crespo died when a 27-inch TV fell on her in neighbouring Oceanside.

On this occasion the set was also on top of the dresser when the toddler climbed onto it and it toppled over.

Isabella's grandmother, Lydia Rodriguez, has also spoken about her devastation at the death.

'My grandchildren were very mischievous, everything was easy for them, they were always playing, they were a handful,' she said.
