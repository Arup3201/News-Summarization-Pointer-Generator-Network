Led police to bodies: Timothy Ladell Burns leaves the Copiah County Justice Court building in Hazlehurst, Mississippi under armed escort after being charged with two counts of murder and vehicle arson

Police investigating the abduction and murder of a Mississippi family have arrested a second man.

The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation said that 30-year-old Cedric D. Mason, of Jackson, was arrested late on Wednesday and has now been charged with two counts of capital murder and two counts of kidnapping, Fox News reports.

The hunt for the family, who had been missing since Saturday, ended in tragedy after detectives found three bodies in an abandoned house near the spot where the family's SUV was burned out.

The Mississippi Bureau of 
Investigation arrested 42-year-old Timothy Ladell Burns Tuesday after he
led authorities to the remains of Jaidon Hill, 7; his mother, Atira Hughes-Smith, 30; and his step-father, 34-year-old Laterry Smith in rural Copiah County.

All three were shot to death.

It is not known whether Burns knew the three victims or whether he was a stranger.

Burns has been charged with two counts of murder and arson.

The circumstances of the disappearance of Hill, Mrs Hughes-Smith and Mr Smith baffled police ever since they vanished Friday night.

Hours later, the family's SUV was found burned out and flipped on its roof in a ditch along side a rural road.

WDBD-TV showed video of detectives carrying three body bags out of the woods near the abandoned, run-down house Tuesday.

On Monday, Mrs Hughes-Smith's ID, clothes and other belongings were found in a garbage Dumpster outside a grocery store in nearby Jackson, Mississippi.

Charged: Cedric D. Mason was arrested late on Wednesday. Mason, 30, of Jackson, has been charged with two counts of capital murder and two counts of kidnapping in relation to the deaths of a Mississippi couple and their seven-year-old son

Murdered: Jaidon Hill, 7, who vanished with his mother and step-father, was found dead alongside them

The Jackson Clarion-Ledger reports that the garbage bin is near the house where Laterry Smith's mother and two sisters lived.

The three family members reportedly had moved out of the house on Sunday night after the family was reported missing.

Jaidon,
Mrs Hughes-Smith and Mr Smith were last heard from Friday night when 
Mrs Hughes-Smith called family members to say she was leaving town for a
few days.

However, the call abruptly dropped.

On Saturday morning, police found the family's burned out SUV overturned in a ditch.

The vehicle was charred and its front-bumper was smashed and it was resting on its roof. The family was nowhere to be found and there were no clues as to what may have happened to them.

Sheriff: Copiah County Sheriff Harold Jones speaks to reporters following a Copiah County Justice Court appearance by Timothy Ladell Burns, the man investigators suspect in the deaths of three family members

'We have no idea where these people are,' Copiah County Sheriff Harold Jones told ABC News.

'We have some people we need to talk to, but we can't find them.'

Police initially thought that Mrs Hughes-Smith and Mr Smith torched the truck as a form of insurance fraud - a practice not uncommon in the area. However, they have since ruled out that explanation.

Jones will not say whether he believed foul play is involved, though he will not rule it out, either.

Jaidon is 3 feet tall, 44 pounds, black skin and brown eyes. Atira Hughes-Smith is 5 feet tall, 148 pounds, black with brown eyes and brown hair.

Laterry Smith is 5-foot-8, 180 pounds and black with browns eyes and brown hair.
