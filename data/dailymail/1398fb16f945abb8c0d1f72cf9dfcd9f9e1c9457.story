A New Mexico couple, who joyously posed for their engagement photos on top of Sandia Peak in Albuquerque, found themselves stuck on the summit for more than four hours because of high winds. 

Arthur Edelhoff and his fiancee Lindsay Duncan of Corrales were joined by the bride-to-be’s seven-year-old son Gatlin and their wedding photographer  Robin Parrott as they took the tram up the mountaintop last Sunday evening for their unforgettable photo shoot.

But after taking a series of romantic pictures, which will be displayed at their Kentucky Derby themed wedding on May 2, the couple and their companions were told that they had to wait for the 40mph wind to die down before they could get down the mountain.

For better or worse: The couple held each other as they took in the view. After taking the tram up the mountain last Sunday for their engagement photos, they were left stranded on the summit because of the high winds

According to Ms Parrott, the couple, who has been engaged for two years, made the best out of the situation. 

'[They] did not lose the romance of it,' she told Daily Mail Online in an email. 'He braided her hair while sitting on a wool blanket laid on the floor of the waiting room next to the bathroom.' 

She added: 'The tram had no real emergency plan and [we] were worried we would be there all night.'

Mr Edelhoff told KOB-TV that they were never given a time frame as to how long it could be, noting that they weren't aware whether they would be stuck on the mountain for five minutes or multiple hours.

Tight quarters: The couple, who have been engaged for two years, were stranded in a building on top of the summit with Miss Duncan's seven-year-old son Gatlin, Ms Parrott and nearly 150 other people 

Jay Blackwood, the assistant manager of the Sandia Peak Tram, confirmed to the outlet that 140 people were stranded that night.

'Our plan in the winter time is to basically put everybody inside in the nice warm building, keep them safe, and keep them out of the weather until we can take them down in the tram,' he explained.

But Mr Edelhoff, who didn't get off the mountain until 10:30pm, said the tram needs a better emergency plan in place.

'There was a pregnant woman up there. There were children that were getting cold and hungry,' he said. 'They need to be more accommodating.'

Sticking it out: Those who were stuck on the mountain slept on benches and tried to keep warm as they waited to be able to return home

He added: 'The weather changes quickly in New Mexico, so you need to be able adjust to it.' 

Although Sandia Peak tramway's website does warn that 'weather conditions can change quickly in the mountains and that certain conditions may cause the tramway to close without notice', Ms Parrot agreed that the tram should be better prepared.

'One of the employees told us as we were going down that they were about to run out of water up there for the toilets and drinking water supply,' she said in her email. 

Despite the night's difficulties, the story behind Mr Edelhoff and Miss Duncan's engagement pictures is one that they will certainly never forget.
