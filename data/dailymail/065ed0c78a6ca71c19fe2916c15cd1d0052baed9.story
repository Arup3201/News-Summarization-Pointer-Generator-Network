The mother of twins arrested for alleged looting in Brixton has claimed that she thought her two sons had gone to the gym.

Linette Livingstone said she was horrified to discover that her 19-year-old sons Icha and Micha had both been arrested following Sunday's disturbances.

The pair were some of the first people to be remanded in custody over the alleged looting. They are accused of taking part in the raid of a Curry's store in Brixton.

The judge said he was remanding the defendants in custody because he ruled they may rejoin the rioting if they were released.

But Ms Livingston, 58, said her two sons were 'good boys' and that 'they don't need to steal.'

Speaking to the Evening Standard, she said: 'That is not how I raised them.

'They were just in the area 
but the police rounded everyone up and now they are in prison. It will 
kill them.

'They are not street wise, they are not like that.'

The twins' case is one countless cases being dealt with at magistrates courts across the capital, with sitting being held late into the night.

More than 30 people - mostly teenagers 
or in their early twenties - appeared in custody at Camberwell 
magistrates' court and were remanded as a result of the anarchy.

Among those was Byron Cawley, 19, of West Norwood who pleaded guilty to burglary of the Iceland Store in Croydon.

He said he was a good guy who had been swept up in anarchy.

Appearing via videolink, he told the court: 'I didn't go out to cause trouble or anything. I just got caught up in the wrong situation, I'm not into crime or anything, I just saw this opportunity for food and I didn't really think.'

District Judge Tan Ikram refused him bail until he returns to court tomorrow, possibly for sentence.

Caught on camera: Shereka Leigh was captured trying on trainers stolen from a sports shop in Tottenham following the riots

Elsewhere in London the mother of one
 of the women caught on CCTV looting the Tottenham branch of JD Sports 
has spoken of her shame.

Navlet Robinson, said she had already disowned her daughter Shereka Leigh, 22, prior to the violence, which saw her try on trainers as she stole them during Sunday morning's clean-up.

'A bad person': Leigh's mother said her daughter causes her trouble and that they no longer speak as she doesn't want anything to do with her

Ms Robinson told the Daily Telegraph: 'The first I knew of it was when I switched on the television
 and saw her trying on the shoes. I couldn't believe it, but lots of 
people started to ring me and say that's Shereka on the news. We fell 
out earlier this year and have not spoken since May.

'She
 can be a bad person and causes me trouble so I don't want to have 
anything to do with her. She can be aggressive and we no longer speak.'

'All I care about is my little four-year-old grandson, Kevantae, but I haven't seen him for a while.'

She continued: 'It makes me said to see what is happening in London. People have worked hard to build up their businesses but then they are having them destroyed by the looters and people burning them down.'

Leigh had spent most of her life in Tottenham, living in a council flat after becoming pregnant at 17.

She later moved to a flat in the High Road, where Saturday's trouble flared. She was later evicted after complaints from neighbours.

One resident told the Telegraph: 'She was evicted about four weeks ago and we don't know where she has gone now.

'We were very relieved when she left because she was always causing problems for us.

'She always had friends round who would slam doors and play loud music. There were children here and so it was very bad.'
