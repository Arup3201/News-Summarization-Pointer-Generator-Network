Dopey: Renea Lucero got her friends arrested after she set up a drug deal with a friend of a friend - who just happened to be a police officer

When Renea Lucero picked up her phone and started dialling last week, she thought she could make a fast buck hawking some heroin or cocaine to a friend of a friend.

So when the her call was picked up, the 30-year-old from Albuquerque, New Mexico, made her pitch and arranged to meet the addict close to the city's international airport.

Stuffing a small package of heroin into her bra - for safety's sake - Lucero called on her friend Luciano Navarro to drive, and girlfriend Selina Padilla for moral support, and the trio made their way to the McDonald's on San Mateo and Gibson, in Albuquerque's south.

The buyer was there, waiting. The gang pulled over and Lucero dug out the drugs and handed it to Navarro, who weighed out the correct amount and exchanged it with the buyer for just $30.

The deal, it seemed, had gone down without a hitch and the trio drove off to enjoy the modest spoils of their illegal trade.

Except, minutes later, Navarro, Lucero and Padilla were all under arrest.

The person Lucero had called, it turned out, was not who she thought - it was an Albuquerque police detective who knew her from a prior criminal case.

Court documents filed by the detective, seen by KOB-TV, say that at 2.15pm last Wednesday he picked up a phone call to his department-issued cell phone and got an unexpected offer. 

'Do you need anything?' Lucero allegedly asked the detective.

The quick-thinking cop played it cool. 'What have you got?' he asked her vaguely.

'Black or white,' she replied, using local slang terms reportedly referring to heroin and cocaine.  

Of course, it was an offer he couldn't refuse, and he used the opportunity to set up a drug sting.

Scene of the crime: The McDonald's on San Mateo and Gibson where undercover officers met up with the trio and bought $30-worth of heroin. All three were arrested shortly afterwards

Lucero was arrested on trafficking charges. In questioning, she admitted to detectives that she had called him, and that she mistook him for a friend of her boyfriend, court documents said.

She's alleged to have told police she was just trying to raise enough cash for gas to get to Las Lunas.

It was not known if she had an attorney, according to the Associated Press.
