Neymar was involved in a row with a Manchester City fan after being substituted during Barcelona's Champions League last-16 victory at the Etihad Stadium.

The Brazil captain left the pitch with ten minutes to play and Barcelona sitting pretty with a 2-1 lead over 10-man City.

But instead of watching his team see out the win, the forward engaged in a verbal spat with a City fan who shouted at him in Portuguese.

After the initial exchange things appeared to have cooled off, with Neymar posing with another fan for a selfie, but the striker restarted matters after the final whistle.

Rather than going down the tunnel, the Barca star returned to argue with the fan before a steward intervened.

The supporter, wearing a City shirt with Yaya Toure's name on the back, appeared to indicate that Neymar had been diving during the game. 

As the 23-year-old approached the supporter made repeated hand gestures, before being pushed away and told to 'stop it' by a steward.

After the game Neymar attempted to play down the incident. He was quoted in the Brazilian media saying 'I was just playing with him. He began to curse me and I ended up mocking him.'

The striker would not reveal what exactly was said in the altercation, but hinted that the fan swore at him.

'What he told me? I can not repeat it, no,' he joked. 'My mother gave me an education. What his mother did not tell him, my mother taught me.'

Neymar could face sanctions from UEFA if City decide to report the incident, which was not seen by match officials.

The Brazilian was in fine form during Barcelona's win, as the Spanish side outclassed Manuel Pellegrini's City side.

Luis Suarez scored both goals before Sergio Aguero pulled one back for the hosts, and Lionel Messi missed a penalty in stoppage time.
