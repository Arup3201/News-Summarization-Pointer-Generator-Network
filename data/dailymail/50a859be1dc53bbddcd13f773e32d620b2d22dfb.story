Paula Abdul was ‘very gracious’ and Nicole Scherzinger was ‘disappointed’ about being fired from The X Factor, Simon Cowell has revealed.

The former American Idol judge has given his first candid interview about the behind-the-scenes shake-up that rocked the U.S. talent show last month.

Cowell, 52, spoke to ex-girlfriend Terri Seymour in a segment for the entertainment show, Extra.

Goodbye: Simon Cowell has opened up about firing Nicole Scherzinger and Paula Abdul from The X Factor judging panel on the US version of the show after just one season

The presenter wasted no time in finding out, when and why Abdul and Scherzinger were sacked and how they reacted to the news.

Cowell said that Fox network executives told him ‘at the beginning of the year’ that changes needed to be made to the show, which averaged 12.6 million viewers by the end of its first season.

‘It was fairly straight what they wanted,’ he said. ‘We were told it had to happen straight away.’

Cowell said that Abdul, 49, was ‘fine’ and ‘gracious’ when she heard the news.

Last one standing: LA Reid is the only judge - apart from Cowell - to be kept on from the first series

He said of his former American Idol colleague: ‘She was fine. I called her that night.

‘She was very gracious and I said that to her. She understands it’s business.  It’s never personal.’

He went on to say: ‘I would have liked to have kept her. ‘

Cowell also opened up about Scherzinger.

Speaking of the 33-year-old former Pussy Cat Doll, he said ‘I don’t think she’s mad. I think she’s disappointed.’

Cowell didn’t address the removal of Steve Jones, who was brought over from the UK to host the US version of the show.

But he did explain the decision to keep LA Reid, the only judge, other than himself, from the original team. He said: ‘There’s not a record executive out there who is as good as him.’

Cowell refused to be drawn into which personalities have been approached to join the judging panel.

He did, however, take the time to dispel rumours that he has offered Beyonce $100 million to be on the next series.

Cowell vehemently denied the claims, saying: ‘No. I have no idea where this rumour came from.

‘I read it online that I'd offered her $100 million a year. It's complete nonsense.

‘The budget of the show is $100 million. No one is going to pay $100 million a year for someone.

‘Forget it. No. It would never ever, ever, happen. It's absolute nonsense.

‘And I genuinely haven’t had a conversation with her about it. I swear to God. No. ‘

Cowell also slapped down rumours he has made an offer to Mariah Carey, who gave birth to twins last year.

‘She's not on the list because I don't think Mariah would make that commitment,’ he said.

‘She's just had kids…You have to work five days a week on this show and you've got to do all this travelling as well.

‘So, just to put it out there, she will not be on the list.

‘I would love her [to do it], but you can't expect someone who's just had two kids, who's got a record career, to make the kind of commitment you would need on this show.’

Cowell remained tight-lipped about who he has considered for the two judging vacancies.

But when asked about other possible celebrities he was quick to give his opinion. He said Elton John was ‘absolutely not’ being considered.

‘He wouldn't do it and he would be really difficult to work with,’ Cowell said of the Crocodile Rock singer.

He said Madonna would be ‘great.’

No mention: Cowell didn't discuss fellow Brit Steve Jones, pictured with Scherzinger, who was also let go from the show

‘In terms of experience and success I think she would be brilliant,’ he told Seymour before saying that she would also be ‘lippy’ and ‘expensive.’

Cowell also said that Katy Perry would be ‘fun’ and ‘hard’ but ‘feisty’ at the same time.

The X Factor creator was adamant that he is not looking for celebrity judges.

American Idol boasts singers Jennifer Lopez and Steven Tyler on their judging panel, while The Voice has pop stars like Christina Aguilera and Cee-Lo Green.

Cowell said: ‘I’m not playing this game where we have to compete on the level of A-lister stars.

‘Once you go down that route, you’re headed for big trouble…because you can lose focus on what the show is all about and at the end of  the day the most important thing is the contestants and I want to put all my resources into finding stars from the show.’

He also said: ‘The show has to evolve. We have some thoughts and you’re going to find out in the next few weeks.’

Before
 The X Factor premiered in the US last year Cowell predicted it was 
going to be a huge ratings winner that would rival American Idol.

While he won’t say the first season was a failure, he admits that he was overconfident.

‘Most things did work,’ he said. ‘It's only because I opened my big mouth and said we were going to get 20million [viewers].

‘If I hadn't said that, everybody would be saying the show, as a new show, was a huge success.’

On Sunday night the second series of The Voice debuted with a massive 37.6 million viewers.

The show, which has been a hit with the US TV audience, focuses on four celebrity singers, mentoring competitors on the basis of their vocal ability rather than their appearance.

Cowell doesn’t believe this is a unique approach but rather something that he pioneered through The X Factor, which first aired in the UK in 2004.

 ‘Everyone thinks The Voice started this whole mentoring thing, but it’s complete nonsense,’ he said.

‘Our show was on years before them and we were always different from other shows because our judges were mentors and then they come out with The Voice in America and they have mentors.

‘But that was copied from us.’
