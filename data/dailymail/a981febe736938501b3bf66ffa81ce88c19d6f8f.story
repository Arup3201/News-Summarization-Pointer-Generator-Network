A Chicago father and his girlfriend have been arrested after police say the couple beat the man’s 11-year-old daughter because she ate his ice cream.

Pierre Scarbrough, 41, and 37-year-old Faith Alston have been charged with aggravated battery of a child and domestic battery.

On Sunday, a Cook County judge ordered each of them held on $200,000 bail.

Chicago Sun-Times reported that the incident happened last Thursday when Scarbrough discovered that his 11-year-old daughter had finished all of his ice cream.

The man became upset, and he and Alston spent hours discussing how he would punish the child by beating her with an electrical cord when she returned from school.

The 11-year-old came home at around 4pm, and about four hours later, her father and Alston entered the girl's bedroom.

According to Assistant State's Attorney Heather Kent, the 37-year-old woman grabbed the girl and held her down while Scarbrough struck her with a cord a dozen times, leaving her with deep cuts and welts to her arms and back. 

Crime scene: The beating took place inside the couple's apartment on the South Side of Chicago

Collaborator: Officers say Alston helped her boyfriend plot the assault and held the girl down during the beating

Police were called to the girl’s school Friday after an assistant dean noticed her injuries.

According to a police report, the victim also told officers that her father punched her in the left eye May 1.

Scarbrough and Alston were arrested in their South Side home on Friday. According to police, the couple admitted to the Thursday beating.

The child was taken to a local hospital to be treated for her injuries.
