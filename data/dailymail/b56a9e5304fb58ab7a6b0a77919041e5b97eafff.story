Atheists are the latest group that controversial Duck Dynasty patriarch Phil Robertson has decided to train in his cross hairs.

At a Florida prayer meeting last week, the 68-year-old used a very graphic and brutal story about murder, castration and child rape to explain the inherent problems with non-believers.

In his lucrative second career as a Christian speaker, Robertson used the hypothetical situation to illustrate whether or those who don't believe in God can know right from wrong.

Controversial: Phil Robertson has developed a second career speaking at Christian events (seen here at one prior to his speech in Florida on Friday)

The story begins with Robertson challenging his audience to make a bet with him: 'Two guys break into an atheist's home. He has a little atheist wife and two little atheist daughters. Two guys break into his home and tie him up in a chair and gag him.'

With the unsettling scene set, Robertson carried on with his morality tale.

'Then they take his two daughters in front of him and rape both of them and then shoot them, and they take his wife and then decapitate her head off in front of him and then they can look at him and say, 'Isn't it great that I don't have to worry about being judged? Isn't it great that there's nothing wrong with this?'' Robertson said. 'There's no right or wrong, now, is it dude?''

To finish off his point and leave his audience in no doubt about his point, Robertson then took relish in describing a castration.

'Then you take a sharp knife and take his manhood and hold it in front of him and say, 'Wouldn't it be something if there was something wrong with this? But you're the one who says there is no God, there's no right, there's no wrong, so we're just having fun. We're sick in the head, have a nice day.'

Outspoken: Duck Dynasty's Phil Robertson (pictured here in Maryland in February) made another controversial speech in Florida on Friday

To finish off his modern-day parable, Robertson then said, 'If it happened to them, they probably would say, 'Something about this just ain't right.'

This of course is just the latest in a long ling of controversial comments the Duck Dynasty star has made.

In 2013 during a GQ interview he likened homosexuality to bestiality and adultery and also said that black people were happier before the civil rights movement.

In response to the speech, the Friendly Atheist blog said that Robertson probably doesn't know any atheists and therefore is unqualified to make his damning assessment.

'I don't know a single atheist or agnostic who thinks that terrorizing, raping, torturing, mutilating, and killing people is remotely OK, and I frankly think that Robertson doesn't either,' wrote the blog.
