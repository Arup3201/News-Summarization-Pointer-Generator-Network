Incendiary: Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy was paid £128,000 to talk at a Jewish fundraiser

Nicolas Sarkozy was paid more than £128,000 to criticise Israel to a room full of enraged Jewish business people, it emerged today.

Delivering a master class in how not to perform a paid-for conference speech, the former French president caused offence at the prestigious world economic forum at Davos, Switzerland.

Despite being hired to make his speech at a United Israel Appeal, Mr Sarkozy made it clear that he saw a proper Palestinian homeland as the only secure future for the Middle East. 

He attacked Israel for ‘surrounding herself with the walls of Jericho’, saying ‘it will be necessary to bring these walls down to prevent disaster.’

Mr Sarkozy’s words last Friday called for international pressure to be brought on Israel, so that it complied with Palestinian demands.

This outraged many in the room, who included influential business people with close links to the state of Israel.

His words were highlighted in the Times of Israel, which wrote: ‘The speech was reportedly poorly received by those present, who felt Sarkozy was venting his disappointment with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

‘Many of the participants complained to the organisers and even threatened to withdraw their donations and convince others to do the same.’ 

The notoriously controversial Mr Sarkozy then left the room in the President Wilson Hotel in Davos, as many of the audience threatened to withdraw their donations.

Flashpoint: The former French president suggested a Palestinian homeland was the only secure future for the Middle East

Mr Sarkozy’s maternal grandfather was a 
Greek Jew. Sarkozy is a Catholic, but maintained strong links with 
Israel when he was French president up until last May.

He is currently at the centre of a number of corruption enquires, including one in which he is accused of accepting illegal cash payments from France’s richest woman.

The allegation is that Liliane Bettencourt, the l’Oreal heiress helped to fund Mr Sarkozy’s 2007 presidential election campaign.

Anniversaire: Sarkozy celebrates his 57th birthday on a night out with his glamorous wife Carla Bruni in Paris yesterday

As Mr Sarkozy’s lawyers deal with such scandals, he is trying to establish himself as an international conference speaker in the style of Bill Clinton and Tony Blair.

Mr Sarkozy’s efforts  at becoming a highly-paid raconteur have been hampered by the fact that he does not speak very good English, and his latest gaffe will also set his ambitions back.

He was unavailable for comment today.
