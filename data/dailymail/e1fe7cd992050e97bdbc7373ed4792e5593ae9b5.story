A serial sex offender who murdered teenage model Sally Anne Bowman has been moved to a new prison for his own protection, his victim's mother has revealed.

Serial sex offender Mark Dixie, 44, was jailed for a minimum of 34 years after he killed the 18-year-old and had sex with her while she lay 'dead or dying' in 2005.

Her partially naked body was left in a pool of blood in the driveway to her home in Croydon, south London.

Sally Anne, a student at the BRIT School for Performing Arts, had been stabbed seven times, bitten and subjected to a gruesome sexual attack. 

Dixie, a violent, sex-obsessed chef, was found guilty of her murder on February 22 2008 and was sentenced to life imprisonment at the Old Bailey.

The judge recommended Dixie should not be released for a minimum of 34 years, by which time he will be 70 years old.

This is among the longest minimum terms ever imposed upon a single murderer.

Dixie was moved from Belmarsh Prison to HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire after inmates at the south London jail vowed to maim him after he was sentenced in February 2008.

Now Sally Anne's mother Linda Bowman has revealed he has been moved again after being 'slapped about' by fellow prisoners. 

This time he has been moved to HM Prison Frankland in County Durham - the same prison as child killer Ian Huntley.

It is understood he was transferred earlier this year. 

'Dixie is living in fear of being stabbed or beaten to death and I think that is the least he deserves,' said Mrs Bowman.

'He got himself put on a Vulnerable Person wing at Long Lartin because he said he feared for his life.

Transferred: This time Dixie has been moved to HM Prison Frankland in County Durham - the same prison as child killer Ian Huntley. It is understood he was transferred earlier this year

'I've heard that he has been slapped about a couple of times but if you ask me, that's not far enough.

'He deserves a slow and painful death for what he has done.

'I can not get my head around the fact that there will be an empty space my Christmas table this year while he is looking forward to a festive party with his inmates.

'He doesn't deserve a fresh start.

'I want everyone to know what he is.'

Dixie, who pleaded not guilty to murder, told the Old Bailey he had stumbled across Sally Anne's body outside her home and had sex with her before realising she was dead.

However, he was found guilty of the teenager's murder, which took place while he was high on cocaine and alcohol on his 35th birthday.

Grieving: Mrs Bowman (pictured centre with Sally Anne's sisters Nicola, left, and Michelle at the Old Bailey in 2008) says what Dixie has done to her family 'can never be undone'

Mrs Bowman said: 'It may have been nine years to everyone else but to me and the rest of the family it may as well have been nine hours.

'We have all suffered so much because of that thing - I can't even bring myself to say his name sometimes.

'I have been unable to work since Sally Anne was killed and my health has deteriorated.

'What he has done to this family can never be undone.

'I wish someone would put a rope and a chair in his room and let him get on with it.'

It was reported in 2009 that Mrs Bowman had heard there was a £50,000 bounty on Dixie's head.

She said his repulsive crimes had made him a 'marked man' and disliked more than the other offenders.

A spokesman from the Ministry of Justice said he could not comment on individual cases.
