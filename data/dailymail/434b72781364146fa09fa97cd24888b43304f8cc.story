A US attack on Syria could provoke reprisals ranging from missile strikes to terrorist attacks and cyberwar, according to government officials and private analysts.

US military commanders are preparing contingency plans for a potential counter-strike by Syria's military, defense officials have revealed.

The officials expressed confidence that the United States and U.S. regional allies such as Israel could deter or neutralize an immediate response from Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

A European defense official said the 
purpose of building up large forces near Syria - mostly in the form of 
naval assets - was to deter Assad.

'The important thing is to have enough force to control the escalatory 
response,' said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Even so, 'there is no military action without risk, and a punitive 
strike on Syrian regime forces would carry some. Weapons could hit 
unintended targets, perhaps killing civilians,' Jeffrey White of the 
Washington Institute for Near East Policy think tank wrote this week.

'The regime could strike back in unexpected ways against U.S. and allied
interests, or it could resort to further (chemical weapons) attacks 
inside Syria.'

Syria and its close regional ally, Iran, both are widely believed to 
have ballistic missiles capable of reaching Israel and other U.S. allies
nearby, such as Turkey and Jordan.

Hezbollah, the Shi'ite militia backed by Tehran and fighting on Assad's 
side in Syria, has tens of thousands of short-range rockets in southern 
Lebanon, near Israel's border.

A coalition spearheaded by the US, Britain and France is preparing to punish Assad for allegedly gassing to death hundreds of innocent people last week

The hope is that the attacks will deter Assad from using chemical weapons and make it more difficult for him to launch them in future

Many analysts predict that Syria and its allies will avoid a direct 
conflict with the United States and opt instead for an 'asymmetric 
response' aimed at Western vulnerabilities - terror or cyber attacks, 
for example.

Assad also could opt not to respond to a strike, hoping to wait out the US and allied military threat.

A US official with experience in the Middle East said that Washington 
also is concerned that Iran could turn up the heat in Iraq. So far, 
resurgent violence by Sunni militants there has not been answered with 
retaliation from Shi'ite militias with ties to Tehran.

There are still militias in Iraq 'that would respond most likely if the 
Iranians put pressure on them,' said the official, who is not authorized
to comment publicly on the matter. 'It's something that's of concern, 
and something that's on everybody's minds.'

The potential for retaliation by Syria or its allies is among the 
growing concerns in the U.S. Congress and elsewhere about President 
Barack Obama's moves toward launching missile strikes against Syria in 
light of its apparent use of chemical weapons against civilians outside 
Damascus on August 21.

Some lawmakers and analysts say they worry that Washington could be 
sucked into Syria's 2-1/2-year-old civil war - something Obama has long 
resisted. Others argue that a few volleys of missiles aimed at Syrian 
military facilities would have little effect, and might even embolden 
Assad.

'It is vital we avoid shortsighted military action that would have 
little impact on the long-term trajectory of the conflict. We can't 
simply launch a few missiles and hope for the best,' Senator James 
Inhofe, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said 
on Wednesday.

How Syria itself will respond will be key, although many analysts expect
Assad initially will simply absorb any strikes as long as they do not 
appear intended to decapitate his government.

Hundreds died in the alleged chemical attacks on Wednesday, including many women and children

Activists say that somewhere near 1,300 were killed in the chemical weapons attack on Wednesday near Damascus. Syria has one of the largest stockpiles of chemical weapons of any country

'I think the calculation will be, "Let's just hunker down, take what we 
think will be a limited series of strikes and then just live to fight 
another day,'" said Shawn Brimley of the Center for a New American 
Security.

'I'd be surprised if Assad tried to respond because that would just 
further draw the United States into an engagement,' said Brimley, who 
recently served on Obama's National Security Council staff.

'He probably
has the calculation that if the United States becomes decisively 
engaged that he's unlikely to survive.'

Iran's military chief of staff, Hassan Firouzabadi, was quoted by a 
state-run Iranian news agency on Wednesday as promising that 'any attack
on Syria would burn down Israel'.

But Iran seems unlikely to directly attack Israel, which almost 
certainly would deliver a robust military response.

And Iran's newly 
inaugurated president, Hassan Rouhani, took office promising to improve 
Tehran's foreign relations.

Iran could turn to Hezbollah, however, to accomplish its goals.

Would bombing Syria be lawful?

Britain
and the US insist it would be, but the truth is far from clear. It’s 
hard to see how Syria’s reported chemical attacks against its own 
citizens present a direct threat to either country.

What specific laws or UN conventions might be used as justification?

The
UN Charter allows for military action on only two grounds – in 
self-defence, or if action is approved by the UN Security Council. 
Neither applies here.

Russia has made clear its intention to veto any proposed Security Council resolution authorising action – as has China.

Can a military strike be legal without a UN resolution?

Unclear.
In 1999, the Nato bombing campaign against Serbia was launched without 
one, with Tony Blair and President Clinton seeking to justify it on 
humanitarian grounds to protect Kosovan civilians.

The
intervention was widely welcomed, but its legality was questionable. A 
similar humanitarian argument is being used to defend intervention in 
Syria.

If President 
Assad is proved to have launched poison gas attacks on his own people, 
he will be in breach of the Geneva Gas Protocol, an international 
agreement dating back to 1925 – to which Syria is a signatory – banning 
the use of chemical weapons.

But
breaching the protocol doesn’t provide a clear justification for 
military action and it normally applies to international conflicts, 
rather than civil wars.

Does the UN have a ‘Responsibility to Protect’ the Syrians?

In
2005, following the hideous atrocities committed in Rwanda and Bosnia 
in the 1990s, the UN brought forward an initiative called the 
‘Responsibility to Protect’.

It
was designed to protect the innocent from genocide, war crimes and 
ethnic cleansing and places a duty on individual states to prevent such 
horrors within their borders, and an obligation to intervene if they see
it elsewhere.

But former UN assistant Secretary-General, Francesc Vendrell, says the doctrine does not necessarily justify the use of force.

All
diplomatic efforts must have been tried first, and even then military 
intervention requires the backing of the Security Council – taking David
Cameron and President Obama back to square one.

'A Hezbollah attack on Israel is likely, and in fact some are 
speculating about yet another Hezbollah-Israeli war in Lebanon,' said 
Hayat Alvi, a lecturer in Middle East studies at the U.S. Naval War 
College.

'Iran and Syria can target coalition cyber-based infrastructure and 
other potential targets,' Alvi added. 'They prove to be quite capable in
that domain.'

A pro-Hezbollah religious leader, Sheikh Afif Nabulsi, warned on Tuesday
that a U.S. strike on Syria 'would be met by harsh responses against 
U.S. interests in the region and against Israel directly,' according to 
Lebanon's Daily Star newspaper.

Yet Hezbollah's calculations might be complex too.

The group has sent thousands of fighters into Syria to help Assad quash 
mostly Sunni rebels, stretching its capabilities and sparking apparent 
attacks against it by Sunnis back in Lebanon.

'Hezbollah may say, "Actually, I don't want to get sucked in further 
over Assad's poor decision to use chemical weapons,'" said Matthew 
Levitt, author of a book on Hezbollah that is due to be released next 
week.

Iran, Syria and Hezbollah 'are all inclined to do the asymmetric thing,' Levitt said.

Hezbollah's most likely response, he said, will be to tell operatives 
already in the field who are planning violent attacks 'to speed up'.
