Victoria police have used capsicum spray to subdue children 90 times in the past three years, including an 11-year-old girl, documents show.

The revelations have prompted calls for an urgent review of the use of force by police on underage people.

Victoria's Commissioner for Children and Young People Bernie Geary said capsicum spray should not be used as an early option after it emerged police sprayed 90 children under the age of 15 in a three-year period.

In some cases children were sprayed even though they were not armed or were not posing a physical threat to police, the Herald Sun reported.

Documents show a number of cases of children being restrained with pepper spray between 2011 and August 2014, including a 14-year-old girl who was resisting handcuffs in a police cell in Narre Warren, south-east Melbourne.

A 11-year-old girl was sprayed after she tried to throw a chair at a police officer while being interviewed at a police station in Broadmeadows, in north Melbourne.

Another case involved a 13-year-old girl who was sprayed through a window after locking herself in a Department of Human Services bathroom. 

Mr Geary said he was not aware of any police guidelines relating to the use of capsicum spray on children and teenagers, adding that it needed to be addressed.

'Spray should only be used in extreme cases and these reports suggest this isn't the case,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'We're just moving out of a year where violence against women and children is being condemned, and rightfully so.

'It's admirable police-led advocacy and it must extend itself to police practises.'

He would discuss the issue with police in the New Year.

Superintendent David Clayton said police resorted to capsicum spray when children were armed, and are using it more often due to a rise in violence and drug abuse.

'We have had conversations about restraint on children in the past and I'll be continuing that, and more specifically making comments on the use of spray.'

A Victoria Police spokeswoman said officers consider the safety of others and themselves when dealing with people armed with weapons or displaying extreme physical violence towards police, people nearby or themselves.

'While the age of the offender is a consideration in these dangerous incidents, the safety of the community and police is the priority,' she said.

'Our officers are trained to resolve situations using the least amount of force necessary however it is the nature of policing that at times, police will come in contact with people who, for what ever reason don't cooperate and place either themselves, a member of the community or one of our members at risk and in those situations our members have no choice but to use force to protect life and property and affect an arrest.

'Whenever force is used by an officer, the event is recorded and reviewed to ensure our officers are accountable and the use of force was justified under the circumstances.'
