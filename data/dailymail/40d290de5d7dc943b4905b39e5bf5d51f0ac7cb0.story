From the great Italian painter Leonardo da Vinci to the science-fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke, history is packed with great visionaries who have obsessed over what life will be like in the future.

These thinkers, with varying degrees of success, have tried to envisage such matters as how our modes of transport, means of communication and homes will look in years to come.

Bristol architect Andrew Kenyon joined this long line of visionaries when, back in the early 1990s, he entered a competition to design a house for the future.

Bright idea: The prize-winning property, on the market for £345,000, was constructed to reflect what future dwellings would look like

His glass-and-timber design triumphed and the house was built in a quiet cul-de-sac in the town of Cumbernauld between Glasgow and Edinburgh.

Fifteen or so years later, the decision of the competition’s judges seems vindicated. The house, which stands amid rows of typical  suburban houses in Scotland’s central belt,  still resembles a home fit for the future.

‘We fell in love with it because it was different,’ says Stevie Pazikas, 51 – who with his partner, childcare assessor Karen Hillis, 45 – has lived in the house since buying it in 2008.

They have now decided to downsize to concentrate on his electrical-contractor business, and the property is on the market for offers in the region of £345,000.

The dominating feature of the house is its glass atrium. Besides the clear aesthetic value of this vast structure, Kenyon obviously realised that energy conservation would be a key concern for people in years ahead and designed this section with that in mind.

Open air: The atrium in the house, located between Glasgow and Edinburgh, has a glass ceiling and a staircase leading to the mezzanine home office

The air in the atrium is warmed by the sun, so the whole house can be heated by opening the doors adjoining this space, and there are vents in the glass roof to help control the temperature.

Thanks to this – plus the facts that the hot water pipes run under the floor and the  walls are very well-insulated – Stevie and Karen’s heating bills are well below average for this area. In keeping with the sustainability theme, all the timber in the house came from managed forests and the pond in the garden is filled with rainwater that is collected from the roof.

Stevie has used his background as an electrical engineer to install a coloured lighting system so that the atrium is not just an impressive feature in the day.

‘The house takes on a completely different personality at night: it becomes soothing and calming and has almost a gothic castle feel,’ says Karen. Besides this, the couple have done little to the house in the five years they have lived there, leaving Kenyon’s vision to live up to its futuristic promise. They did, however, find the interiors were ‘a little twee’ when they bought it.

‘Curtains were hiding the woodwork and brickwork and rugs were hiding the beautiful Amtico flooring,’ says Karen.

‘We felt it needed updating to suit the architectural aspects of the house and its features, such as its high windows and ceilings.’

Time to downsize: Mr Stevie Pazikas and Miss Karen Hillis in their home in Cumbernauld, which they have decided to sell for business reasons

They say it is an ideal dwelling for social occasions with one side – which they jokingly refer to as the ‘West Wing’ – containing three bedrooms and two bathrooms, while the rest of the property includes a variety of living areas from a dine-in kitchen to a home office, which sits on a mezzanine level.

‘It is a great house for parties, especially in the summer when you can fold back the glass wall in the atrium and allow your guests access to the garden,’ says Karen.

And while their house may stand out from the rest in the area, the couple feel part of a warm community.

‘We have a great social life here.’ says Stevie. ‘Our neighbours have become friends and we often get together for dinner.’

The house is also ideal for golf enthusiasts as it is situated in the middle of the Seve Ballesteros-designed Westerwood course.

Prospective buyers will also be interested to learn of the merits of Cumbernauld, which is a mere 25-minute drive from Glasgow and, with its range of shops, restaurants and theatre, has plenty to offer in its own right.

Katrina Maxwell of selling agents K Property says: ‘This is an exceptional, award-winning home set in the heart of Westerwood.

‘It must be viewed to be fully appreciated.’
