Eden Hazard close to signing new five-year deal at Chelsea worth £200,000 a week

Jose Mourinho has challenged Eden Hazard to become one of the world’s great players after confirming that the Chelsea forward is poised to sign a new contract.

Sportsmail revealed how the Belgian was close to agreeing a new five-year deal worth £200,000 a week, and, speaking before Tuesday evening's Champions League clash against Schalke 04, Mourinho said he hopes the new deal will see Hazard reach even greater heights.

‘He is a fantastic player,’ said Mourinho. ‘We see day by day his motivation to work hard and improve. We have big hopes that he will go from the top player he is at this moment and reach higher levels to become one of the best.

‘We are very proud that he thinks Chelsea is the perfect environment for him to have that evolution.

‘That’s why he wants to commit to us and we want to commit to him for the future too.

‘It will be a question of time, but it will end with a new contract.’

At times last season, however, it seemed Mourinho might have hesitated to sanction a deal that doubles Hazard’s wages.

In May he said of Hazard: ‘He’s not the kind of player ready to sacrifice himself 100 per cent for the team and his mates.’

In November, Hazard was dropped for a match against tonight’s opponents for missing a training session after losing his passport. But now Mourinho insists the 23-year-old Belgium international is showing signs of maturity.

‘Even last season he was changing,’ said Mourinho. ‘It was a big evolution from the Hazard I met in Thailand (on pre-season) when I arrived. He was a kid always living on his natural talent... but there’s been a big improvement.’

The Portuguese boss also fired a chilling warning to Chelsea's rivals, insisting his side are yet to hit top gear despite their 100 per cent start to the season.

The Blues have lived up to their tag as title favourites with a blistering start to the season, summer signings Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas in particular impressing for the Stamford Bridge club.

But Mourinho insists there's still much more to come from his side ahead of Wednesday's Champions League opener. 

'We are far from perfection, we try to improve every day,' said the Portuguese.

'There's things we do behind the scenes to improve everyday. There's different aspects added to our game all the time.

'There's been an evolution from last year. We feel he have the conditions to do better than last season.'

Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic also believes although his side have enjoyed a bright start to the season, the Blues still have a long way to go if they are to collect any silverware this season.

Sitting alongside Mourinho, Ivanovic said: 'Our squad looks good but we know the season is long, so we have to say on this level and be even better.

'I just try to do my best, I've got a couple of goals, but as a defender that's not so important. I really enjoy getting forward and it's good for the confidence when you score, but I prefer not to concede.' 

The team has had the unfamiliar presence of Petr Cech on the substitutes' bench after a decade in the first team, with Thibaut Courtois displacing him as first-choice goalkeeper.

Mourinho declined to reveal who would start in goal, but insisted he has not designated competitions for his goalkeepers.

'Don't be surprised if he (Cech) plays a Champions League game or a Premier League game, or if Courtois plays a Capital One Cup game,' Mourinho said.

'What I don't do is this competition is for me and this competition is for you. I must make choices. Petr is more than ready to play every game.'

Schalke could be in for a tough night if Chelsea continue their blistering start to the season with four Premier League wins in four games.

By contrast, the Germans have just one point from their opening three Bundesliga fixtures. They also have major injury concerns over defenders Benedikt Howedes, Atsuto Uchida and Christian Fuchs.
