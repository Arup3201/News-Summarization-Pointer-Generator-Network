Two oblivious bystanders standing on a railway line in Wyoming almost wound up being victims of probably the slowest train collision in history.

The trainspotters were on the tracks in Cheyenne on Thursday morning to catch the rare treat of a massive 70-year-old steam engine called the No. 4014 'Big Boy' go in for restoration.

Trying to get the best spot for pictures for their scrap books, the two spotters were so absorbed they failed to register the huge diesel engine creeping very slowly up behind them with horns blazing.

Other onlookers began screaming out to get their attention, but the two transfixed trainspotters just carried on taking pictures of 'Big Boy'.

Eventually, fearing the worst, one man simply grabbed the younger of the two spotters out off the tracks.

On Monday last week, Big Boy arrived in Cheyenne to undergo its restoration and the 6,300 horsepowered locomotive attracted quite a crowd.

The American Locomotive Co. in Schenectady, N.Y., built 25 of the monsters to Union Pacific's specifications between 1941 and 1944, and they became legendary.

They were the largest steam locomotives ever to work the rugged terrain of the American West, and by most standards the largest anywhere in the world, said Gordon McCulloh, a meticulous historian of Union Pacific steam power.

Even the name is legendary. An unknown worker scrawled 'Big Boy' on the front of one of the engines when it was under construction.

'It came out one day, and it had "Big Boy" in chalk on it. And from that day forward, it was Big Boy,' said Ed Dickens Jr., Union Pacific's senior manager of heritage operations, who will oversee the restoration at the railroad's steam shop in Cheyenne, Wyoming.
