Sally Bercow and Alan Davies are two of 20 'high-profile' tweeters being targeted by Lord McAlpine for damages, it emerged today.

The Tory peer has accused them of linking him to sex abuse at a north Wales children's home and then spreading the malicious rumour online after a botched Newsnight investigation.

Speaker's wife Bercow, comedian Davies and Guardian columnist George Menbiot are on McAlpine's list of 20, his spokesman confirmed, because the former Tory treasurer believes they helped destroy his reputation.

Battles: Many have apologised to the Tory peer but his legal team has said that people have destroyed his reputation

They are currently using someone with more than 500 Twitter followers as meeting their 'high profile' definition, the spokesman added.

In total the
peer’s lawyers have identified 1,000 ‘original’ tweets and a further 
9,000 retweets, which is when a user re-posts a comment sent to them.

They must apologise and agree to pay a nominal sum as requested to Children in Need, believed to be £5.

McAlpine was accused after a shambolic BBC report led to his name being spread around the internet as a child abuser, which was completely untrue.

Newsnight had not named him but referred to a senior 
Conservative from the Thatcher era, leading to his identification 
online.

Mistake: Sally Bercow took to Twitter to comment on speculation as to the identity of the Tory at the centre of a Newsnight investigation and could be sued

I'm sorry: Mr Davies told his 444,000 followers on Twitter that he had written to Lord McAlpine to apologise

Mrs Bercow then wrote: ‘Why is 
Lord McAlpine trending? *innocent face*.’ But she has defended her 
tweet, describing it as not libellous - ‘just foolish’, has apologised and has now deleted her Twitter account.

Jonathan Creek and QI star Davies had 
tweeted: ‘Any clues as to who the Tory paedophile is?’ and then 
retweeted a response naming Lord McAlpine.

He then told his 444,000 followers this week: ‘I've just written to Lord McAlpine to apologise for retweeting
his name in relation to false allegations following a BBC 
investigation.’

Meanwhile Monbiot tweeted: "I looked up Lord 
McAlpine on t'internet. It says the strangest things." Monbiot later 
apologised on his blog admitting his deep regret over what happened.

But despite the apologies, they all appear to be being pursued and McAlpine's spokesman admitted the list could increase.

McAlpine has already agreed a £185,000 deal 
with the BBC and a £125,000 package with ITV after This Morning 
presenter Phillip Schofield accidentally flashed a list of alleged 
paedophiles to camera before handing it to the bemused Prime Minister.  

Andrew Reid, the peer's lawyer, reiterated yesterday they would look for damages from people who defamed his client on Twitter.

This
was the extraordinary moment Philip Schofield handed a list of alleged paedophiles
to David Cameron and eventually coast ITV £125,000

BBC controversy: Lord McAlpine is taking landmark legal action against internet gossips who falsely branded him a paedophile after BBC's Newsnight broadcast the wrong claims

'I think most importantly we get an apology and an undertaking not to 
repeat and once we've examined the extent of the damage they've done, 
we'll agree suitable damages,' Mr Reid said.

'Some of them we're aware of, some of them have come forward and some 
have been very apologetic. You know all of this will be borne in mind, 
in the same way that ITV were apologetic, as were the BBC.'
