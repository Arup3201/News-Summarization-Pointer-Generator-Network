The decision to get a tattoo is a hard one - and finding a design you like enough to keep forever is even tougher.

But people are now flocking to a tattoo artist who inks from his imagination there and then - no sketchpad in sight.

The astonishing methods of aptly-named tattooist Jay Freestyle, who is based in Amsterdam, results in stunning, soulful artworks, which last forever on the skin.

His inkings appear laboriously planned buy Jay's insanely stunning designs, blends and lines are improvised

His ethereal inkings appear meticulously planned but Jay's floating shadows, thick and thin lines, accurate proportions and expert colour blending are a product of improvisation.

The South African tattoo artist, 29, makes his designs up as he goes along while he is working on his clients.

Inspired by traditional painting techniques such as watercolour and liquid ink, he brings in modern and graphic elements.

His motto reads: 'Give me a piece of your skin and I’ll give you a piece of my soul' which sums up his way of work.

People try to come to Jay with extremely detailed ideas, but after 
talking it through and hearing his extreme knowledge about 
aesthetics, placement, colouring, size and symbolism; almost all turn 
around and say: 'Go for it, I trust you blindly' - and he never disappoints.

Each tattoo he comes up with is a unique illustration from Jay's imagination

'I prefer to combine various styles, such as geometrical shapes and pointillism, while at the same time mixing realism with abstract,' says Jay

He regularly tattoos first timers who feel no fear and fully trust in his respect and
understanding of his clients' wishes.

Jay grew 
up in a conservative Chinese family in Johannesburg and emigrated to 
Amsterdam more than 10 years ago where he has been living and working 
ever since.

He's entirely self-taught and his techniques and style are unconventional.

The spontaneity of his tattoos is what makes every single one so unique. Breaking away from existing boundaries, the final artwork is always a great surprise to the client.

'Most describe my style as watercolor, and it definitely holds elements of such, but personally it is more,' says Jay.

'I prefer to combine various styles, such as geometrical shapes and pointillism, while at the same time mixing realism with abstract, but at the end it all depends on the client.'

Learning from past experiences, travelling worldwide, and fostering his skills as a painter, Jay constantly exposes himself to the influence from top artists from around the world.

Always 
eager to learn something new, he emerged as a broadly skilled tattooist.
 But Jay is now narrowing down his focus and developing a more graphical
 styleand feel to his work.

He's
 building on his trademark and talent of using simple imagery and 
bringing it to life through an avant-garde, abstract ink style.

Jay's somewhat dark motto reads: 'Give me a piece of your skin and I¿ll give you a piece of my soul'

'Usually from the first couple of minutes of talking to someone, I can see if they want my style,' says Jay

'Not everyone wants my style,' he says

'Usually from the first couple of minutes of talking to someone, I can see if they want 'my style' or if they want me to do something realistic or traditional.

'Normally when I'm abroad people ask much more for my style; whereas here in the Netherlands most know me for a variety of styles I've developed and done over the past years; Japanese, Black and Grey, Realism, Neo-Traditional - you name it.'
