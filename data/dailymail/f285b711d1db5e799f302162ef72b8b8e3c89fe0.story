Tucked away in the north of Sydney stands a home which is a throwback to a bygone era.

Now, 28 Barney Ave, Killarney Heights is up for sale for the first time since being built in 1963, and the owner claim's it's not been renovated once in the last 52 years.

The four-bedroom family home, which was originally built by LJ Hooker as a showcase estate, is set to be auctioned next weekend at a price guide between $1.2 million and $1.3 million.

The kitchen inside 28 Barney Ave, Killarney Heights is like stepping back in time and hasn't been touched since it was built in 1963

The time-capsule property boasts spacious defined living and dining areas with high ceilings and timber floors

The 741sq m property offers high ceilings, timber floors, and spaciously defined living and dining areas, as well as a light-filled sunroom which opens onto a peaceful garden.

The suburb of Killarney Heights was bought by LJ Hooker for a showcase estate in 1960.

The late Kenneth and Eilleen Hall bought the property, which was the second built in the suburb, for £9,000 in 1963. Mr Hall was the longest living resident in the suburb.

Daughter Sue Murray told Daily Mail Australia her father, who lived on the property until he was 99 just a few months ago, chose not to change the house in any way.

'He didn't like change, and he wanted to keep it just as it was. He even kept the original brochures,' she said.

Mrs Murray moved into the property as a young child and lived there until she was 18-years-old. She said it's amazing how much the suburb has changed. 

'There weren't many houses around back then. The main street was still a dirt road. It's amazing how much it has changed.'

Now the property is walking distance from supermarkets, cafes, a primary school and a high school.  

The estate was originally named Hooker Rex, boasting 1500 homes in 20 different designs. The original brochures labelled it 'an exciting new world of living, 11 miles by road to the city'.

'It's a lovely quite suburb and quite an opportunity. There aren't many properties left this untouched,' said Mrs Murray.

28 Blarney Ave goes to auction on Saturday, March 28, at a price guide of between $1.2 million and $1.3 million.
