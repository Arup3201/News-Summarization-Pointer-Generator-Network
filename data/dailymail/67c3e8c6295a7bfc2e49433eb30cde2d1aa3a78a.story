Guilty: Joseph Naso, pictured here on June 17, was convicted Tuesday of murdering four women between the 1970s and 1990s, all of whose first and last names began with the same letters

A former 
photographer was convicted Tuesday of murdering four young California 
women decades ago after a two-month trial in which prosecutors called 
him a remorseless serial killer who preyed on young prostitutes.

Jurors
deliberated for about eight hours over two days in Marin County 
Superior Court before finding Joseph Naso, 79, guilty of slaying the 
four women with alliterative names: Roxene Roggasch in 1977, Carmen 
Colon in 1978, Pamela Parsons in 1993 and Tracy Tafoya in 1994.

The
so-called Double Initial Murderer, so named because his victims' first and 
last names all began with the same letter, did not visibly react when 
his damning verdict was read.

The jury of six men and six women will reconvene Sept. 4 to determine if Naso gets the death penalty.

All
the victims were found dumped in rural Northern California locations. 
Roggasch's body was found in Marin County and was the reason Naso's 
trial was held in the historical Marin Civic Center designed by noted 
architect Frank Lloyd Wright. Colon was found in Contra Costa County and
the other two victims in Yuba County.

Naso
was arrested in 2010 after probation officers visiting his Reno, Nev., 
home in connection with an unrelated gun conviction discovered numerous 
photographs of nude women posed in unnatural positions who appeared dead
or unconscious with mannequin parts and lingerie strewn about nearby.

According to KNTV, he told the cops it was his art.

Graphic
entries from Naso's journal that detailed how the killer stalked and 
raped his victims were read in court during the closing arguments.

Naso wrote descriptions of rapes and sexual assaults in 
the journal as far back as the 1950s, Marin County prosecutor Rosemary 
Slote said as she read from the journal's pages.

Naso drugged and photographed his unconscious victims then strangled them and disposed of their naked bodies.

In entry after 
entry, Naso wrote how he would stalk and approach a 
woman, offer her a ride home and then 'put it to her', often in his car.

One read: 'Girl in north Buffalo woods. She was real pretty. Had to knock her out first.'

Investigators
said they also found a ‘List of 10’ that Naso had scrawled with 
descriptions of 10 women, including references prosecutors believe 
described the four victims he was charged with killing.

Investigators
believe Naso could be responsible for as many as six more murders and 
authorities are exploring Naso's connections to several unsolved 
murders.

The six additional
women on the list have not been identified, but authorities continue to
investigate any possible connections to Naso.

Same name: A 10-year-old was raped and murdered in Rochester, New York in 1971. Carmen Colon shared a name with one of Naso's California victims but was far younger than his usual prey

Joseph Naso was convicted Tuesday of killing four prostitutes--all with first and last names beginning with the same letters--in Northern California between the 1970s and 1990s. Investigators found ghoulish personal accounts of what he'd done in a series of journals and lists at his Reno, Nevada home.

Though tried and convicted for only the four crimes, investigators continue to believe Naso could be connected to at least six more murders.

After the Rochester native's arrest in 2010, police briefly fingered him in connection with three other brutal murder cold cases from the New York State area where he was born, lived for a time, and would still continue to visit.

And all three murdered girls had something in common: their first names and last names began with the same letters.

Michelle
Maenza, Wanda Walcowicz, and Carmen Colon--who even had the same name 
as one of the California women Naso is convicted of killing.

These were the original Doube-Initial murders and they rocked the city of Rochester, New York in the mid 1970s.

Evidence
at Naso's home suggests the killer's victims weren't just in 
California. One entry in his frightening 'List of 10' reads 'Girl in 
north Buffalo woods. She was real pretty. Had to knock her out first.'

But while some clues implicated Naso, others seemed to clear him of the crimes.

Though the Rochester girls indeed had 'double initials,' they were also quite young. Each was between the ages of 10 and 12.

Naso's California victims were all adult prostitutes.

Naso
was finally cleared of killing Maenza, Walcowicz, and the Rochester 
Colon after DNA found on one of the victims did not match his own.

Now,
the search continues both for Naso's other possible victims and the 
murderer or murderers of the Rochester double-initial killer.

Naso
acted as his own attorney and told jurors during his closing arguments 
that he often hired prostitutes to photograph in exotic poses and 
enjoyed off-beat art.

But as he smiled, always wearing a suit and tie, he insisted he was no killer.

Nonetheless,
the balding Naso, who often seemed befuddled and repeated himself 
during his rambling closing arguments, struggled to explain away some of
the most persuasive evidence against him.

Naso's
DNA was found on the pantyhose Roggasch was wearing when her body was 
found. His ex-wife's DNA was found on pantyhose wrapped around 
Roggasch's neck.

Naso told 
the jury that the evidence only showed he had had sex with Roggasch. He 
said there was no proof that he killed her and that prosecutors had no 
way of knowing who put the pantyhose around her neck.

Execution? Naso, here in another June 17 file photo, will again represent himself for the penalty phase of the trial as he tried to avoid the death penalty

Unlikely: Even if Naso bumbles even more as he argues against the death penalty, he's unlikely to be executed. California's death row list is likely long enough that the 79-year-old will first die

Graphic diary entries that detail how Naso stalked and raped his victims were read out in court during the closing arguments of his trial.

Naso, 79, wrote descriptions of rapes and sexual assaults in the journal as far back as the 1950s, Marin County prosecutor Rosemary Slote said as she read from the journal's pages.

The lawyer said they contain accounts of Naso approaching women and offering them a ride home.

After a girl got into his car, Naso writes that he would 'put it on her.'

Prosecutors found a 'list of 10' girls they say was a roster of the serial killer's victims.

The victims coincided with locations, including Cleveland, Kansas City, Buffalo, Rochester, Wichita, Berkeley, and even London.

'Outside the front door I overpowered her and ravaged her,' read one entry set in London, the Marin Independent Journal reported. 'I couldn't help myself.'

Another read: 'Girl in north Buffalo woods. She was real pretty. Had to knock her out first.'

Legal
analysts said that Naso made a mistake representing himself, even if he
boasted at one point that ‘I think I'm doing quite well’ during his 
closing arguments, which consumed all day Friday and half of Monday.

‘He's bright,’ said attorney Brian Kanel, who watched some of the trial. ‘But not that bright.’

Another legal observer agreed.

Steven
Clark, a former prosecutor now in private practice, said a good defense
attorney would have hired a DNA expert to at least try to throw some 
doubt on how the evidence was gathered, stored and processed to 
undermine the prosecution's strongest argument.

‘The
prosecution did have a challenging case because it happened so long 
ago,’ Clark said. ‘Why Mr. Naso chose to focus on the things he focused 
on is beyond me. I'm not sure what his plan was.’

Even
if Naso is sentenced to death, it is unlikely he will be executed. 
There are 725 inmates already on California's Death Row and executions 
have been on hold since 2006, when a federal judge ordered an overhaul 
of California's execution protocol. It will take at least another year 
for prison officials to properly adopt the state's new single-drug 
execution method and have it cleared by the judge.

Sheepish: Joseph Naso, 79, smiled often while he represented himself at trial for killing four prostitutes in the 1970s through the 1990s

In court: Naso is pictured with his public defender in April but eventually represented himself. A jury has yet to decide if the 79-year-old will face the death penalty

During his trial, he showed the jury 
dozens of photographs he took of weddings, landscapes and family members
along with what he called 'glamour' or 'cheesecake' photographs of nude
women. He said he never forced any of them to do anything.

Prosecutors, however, claimed he kept a list of his victims and mementos of his crimes. 

Closing
arguments were delayed briefly as the court investigated a truck 
bearing the words 'Joseph Naso killed my sister' that was parked in the 
jury lot.

A district 
attorney's inspector and Naso's private detective looked into the matter
and concluded no contact was made with jurors.

Closing arguments: Last week, Deputy District Attorney Rosemary Slote read from Naso's journal that details how he stalked and raped numerous women. Police believe there were likely more than four

Interruption: The trial was briefly stopped Roggash wrote the message 'Joseph Naso murdered my sister' on the window of a truck in the jury parking lot

'All of them forgotten': Larry Roggasch, whose sister Roxene was killed by Naso, said he was the only family member of any of the women to attend the trial
