Jesus Christ remains the world's most influential figure over 2,000 years after he walked the earth, according to new research.

Academics at U.S. university MIT used data gathered from online encyclopedia Wikipedia to rank famous figures through history in terms of their global reach.

While the likes of pop icons, sports stars and 50 Shades of Grey author E.L. James dominated Time Magazine's annual list of the world's most influential people this year, religious figures, Greek philosophers and scientists prevailed in the Wikipedia-based top 20.

The Macro Connections group, from the MIT-based Media Lab, described its list as a 'socio-cultural mirror'.

The researchers focused on influential people born before 1950, and used data from all language editions of Wikipedia.

'Proxies for culture': Researchers said entries such as physicists Sir Isaac Newton, left, and Albert Einstein, right, offered an insight into global knowledge of the cultures of their respective countries' cultures

Chinese philosopher Confucius, whose teachings focused on personal and governmental morality, justice and sincerity, was at number two, followed by English physicist Sir Isaac Newton at number three.

1. Jesus Christ: Prophet and central figure of Christianity

2. Confucius: Chinese philosopher

3. Sir Isaac Newton: British physicist

4. Gandhi: Indian politician and activist

5. Albert Einstein: German physicist

6. Aristotle: Greek philosopher

7. Vasco da Gama: Portuguese explorer

8. Leonardo da Vinci: Italian artist

9. Plato: Greek philosopher

10. Archimedes: Greek philosopher

11. Mao Zedong: Chinese communist revolutionary

12. William Shakespeare: English playwright

13. Socrates: Greek philosopher

14. Karl Marx: German philosopher and socialist

15. Michaelangelo: Italian sculptor

16. Gautama Buddha: Nepalese spiritual teacher

17. Nelson Mandela: South African politician

18. Galileo Galilei: Italian physicist

19. Julius Caesar: Roman emperor

20. Joseph Stalin: Soviet leader

Communist leaders Chairman Mao and 
Joseph Stalin both made it on to the list of influential figures, at 
numbers 11 and 20 respectively.

South Africa's Nelson Mandela, who is at number 17, is the only living entry on the list.

The group took into account factors 
like the number of language editions in which an individual has a page, 
and the number of people known to speak those languages, when compiling 
the rankings.

But Macro Connections is more interested in what the list reveals about global knowledge of an individual country's culture than a specific historical figure.

'It shows you how the world perceives 
your own national culture,' Cesar Hidalgo, head of the Macro Connections
 group, told Wired Magazine.

For example, playwright William Shakespeare's position at number 12 on the list can be viewed as an indication of worldwide knowledge of a central figure in England's national culture.

'We use historical characters as proxies for culture,' Mr Hidalgo said.

'It is easier to track knowledge about Shakespeare than about each of the characters he created in his writing.'

The list is part of the group's ongoing research into how culture 'assembles itself'.

Mr Hidalgo and his colleagues are using this quantitative approach to test hypotheses such as whether cultural development is structured or random.

The group will be considering questions such as whether it would be possible to have a figure such as Apple Inc co-founder Steve Jobs in a country that has not generated enough science and technology.
