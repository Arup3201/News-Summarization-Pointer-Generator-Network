HANDS OFF IN THE BOX is our new campaign to rid football of the dark arts of the penalty box.

Whether it is wrestling, grappling, shirt pulling - or the outrageous headlocks witnessed in the Manchester United vs Chelsea match - the area has become a free-for-all for cheating.

And that means fewer goals in the Barclays Premier League.

For too long, referees have failed to punish players for blatantly stopping opponents from scoring. It's time to end that.

So join us in our campaign to say Hands Off In The Box to players and referees.

We’ll be naming and shaming the cheats and the officials who let them get away with it.

It was more like a WWE Tag Team match than a game of football.

In the red corner, Manchester United's Marcos Rojo and Chris Smalling. In the blue corner, Chelsea's John Terry and Branislav Ivanovic.

As the whistle blew, all hell broke loose. Rojo took Terry out the equation with a headlock, wrestling him to the ground with a throw a judoka would be proud of. 

Smalling grappled with Ivanovic, managing to twist his arm around the Chelsea defender's neck before dragging him to the ground.

Ivanovic bellowed out, imploring referee Phil Dowd to award what appeared to be an obvious penalty. But Dowd shook his head, the ball flew across goal, the danger passed. 2-0 to the Red team.

Both grapples, by the letter of the law, should have been penalties as the subsequent replays made painfully apparent.

If this WWE behaviour - a headlock, for goodness sake - had happened anywhere else on the pitch, there would have been no hesitation. Free-kick. Yellow card. Perhaps more.

So why is this rough and tumble going unpunished in the penalty box? Bodychecking, or actual bodygrabbing in most instances, inside the box MUST be stamped out.

Referees and assistants need to toughen up - surely they can see this stuff happening? Why don't they intervene every time?  

Yes, there have always been dark arts in the penalty area. Pinching, nudging, shirt-grabbing, an unkind word in the ear. But this is an escalation.

This penalty box incident caused controversy in Sunday's Manchester United vs Chelsea clash - on the left, Branislav Ivanovic wrestles with Chris Smalling while on the right, John Terry grapples Marcos Rojo

We are getting to a situation where set-pieces in football resemble a 'down' in NFL. Certain players don't even watch the ball, they concentrate on a man. The aim is not to clear the ball, it's to block off the run of their opponent. Managers will be getting out the playbook soon. 

And if referees are willing to let this grappling and wrestling continue, then managers will continue to actively encourage it as a defensive tactic. It would be shameful if this kind of thing is being coached.

The football authorities managed to clamp down on reckless challenges from behind. Players know these will result in a yellow or red card, there is no advantage to be gained.

You could argue it should be two penalties. It’s not just Chris Smalling on Ivanovic, you've got Rojo on Terry. The two have virtually got them in headlocks. 

From Dowd’s position he should see this. You can tell by Ivanovic’s reaction; he’s not just appealing — he’s going berserk. The Manchester United ones are worse than Shawcross (versus Swansea) last week.

Now, they must eradicate bodychecking in the box by encouraging the award of more penalties.

Referee Michael Oliver did just that in the Stoke City vs Swansea City match last weekend when Ryan Shawcross wrestled Wilfried Bony to the ground. He had the courage to point to the spot.  

Liverpool's Martin Skrtel has also been punished for grappling inside the box, including for one clash with Bony in a match at Anfield last season.

But far too many instances still go unpunished. There is no consistency on this issue.

Sky Sports reviewed the incident at half-time and showed both Terry and Ivanovic being held in the box

The issue has been looked at before. In France before the 2006-07 season, DVDs were sent to every club to highlight fouls in the box that would be penalised. It briefly worked. PSG defender Mario Yepes conceded four penalties in the first five matches of the season but, after initial success, the enthusiasm petered out. 

Some argue that in such congested and claustrophobic situations as free-kicks and corners, you'd see 20 penalties awarded in every game.

No, this simply wouldn't happen. The concession of one penalty (possibly two) would be a strong deterrent. Players and coaches would quickly learn the lesson. There are ways of defending set-plays without resorting to wrestling moves.

Dowd could have set a powerful precedent by punishing either Smalling or Rojo and awarding a penalty. This was a massive match, which unfolded before the eyes of the whole world.

Stoke's Ryan Shawcross (right) did concede a penalty for this grapple with Swansea's Wilfried Bony last week

The pair clashed in the penalty area and referee Michael Oliver saw fit to point to the spot

Liverpool's Martin Skrtel has also been penalised in the past for penalty area blocking

If he missed the actual incident, then he must have seen Ivanovic's impassioned plea. He is also linked via earpiece to the assistant, who should have been watching attentively too.

Perhaps we need the additional assistants seen in some European competitions, surely spotting incidents like this is their purpose?

As with the other infringements and moments of gamesmanship that have plagued the game, action can and must be taken to end this penalty area WWE. 

THE BEAR HUG

Simple but effective. Stop the opposition by wrapping your arms around them and preventing them from moving. Surprisingly, this is rarely penalised by referees.

THE HEADLOCK

A risky ploy because it’s a more obvious foul. Stops the opposition from moving and can also handily obscure their vision of what’s going on.

THE FOREARM SMASH

A favourite of goalkeepers, who often feel targeted themselves. Stops any attacker in his tracks and makes them think twice about challenging for the ball.

THE SUBTLE SHIRT PULL

With so many bodies in the box, this can be easy to miss. Defenders only need a slight tug to put off an attacker, but that can be more than enough to prevent a goal.

THE TUMBLE AND FALL

An evolution of the bear hug. After grabbing a man, defenders can haul them to the ground while making it look like they’re the ones being bundled over.

MARTIN KEOWN

Smalling grappled with Ivanovic, managing to twist his arm around the Chelsea defender's neck before dragging him to the ground.

Ivanovic bellowed out, imploring referee Phil Dowd to award what appeared to be an obvious penalty. But Dowd shook his head, the ball flew across goal, the danger passed. 2-0 to the Red team.

Both grapples, by the letter of the law, should have been penalties as the subsequent replays made painfully apparent.

If this WWE behaviour - a headlock, for goodness sake - had happened anywhere else on the pitch, there would have been no hesitation. Free-kick. Yellow card. Perhaps more.

So why is this rough and tumble going unpunished in the penalty box? Bodychecking, or actual bodygrabbing in most instances, inside the box MUST be stamped out.

John Terry, Chelsea captain

‘Me and Branislav Ivanovic were double headlocked at every corner.’

Colin Pascoe, Liverpool assistant manager

‘Grappling. That is the new word is it? It is the referees’ interpretation and we’ll leave it to them. That’s what the referees and the officials are paid for. They make decisions. So whatever they decide is grappling, or holding, it’s in their hands really. Did I do it as player? No, I was a winger and didn’t have to mark anyone.’ ian wright Ex-Arsenal striker

‘There should be an official specifically looking for holding in the box from set-pieces. It was like UFC in the United area.’

Graham Poll, Former top referee

‘Hold or grapple and you can expect to be cautioned. Once fans, managers and — crucially — players accept it as normal, this campaign will have achieved its aims.’

Martin Keown, Ex-Arsenal defender

‘Defenders are checking, blocking, holding, grappling, using force to foul opponents — and too often referees are allowing it to take place.’

Micky Mellon, Shrewsbury Town manager

‘In a congested area how can you judge if someone’s been blocked? It’s part of the game and some people are good at it. It’s football. A local Football League referee came in and he was asking me about it. “Can you show me some blocking techniques?” That was great, he was trying to find ways of detecting it. The confusing thing for managers is that fouls outside the area are given as free-kicks, but the same won’t be given as penalties. There has to be consistency.’

And the readers of MailOnline...

‘It’s more infuriating because we never hear from the refs themselves. It’s about time the refs were made to answer the media just like players.’ Willdajack, Neath

‘To those saying if there was a clampdown every game would be littered with penalties, that would be true for a couple of weeks then it would stop. I’ve been watching football since the Sixties and the cheating behaviour in the penalty area now is the worst I’ve ever seen.’ Sir Miles Platting, Manchester

Branislav Ivanovic and John Terry were on the ground, appealing for a penalty after being wrestled down during Manchester United vs Chelsea

But referee Phil Dowd didn't see fit to award a spot-kick

Yet last week, Ryan Shawcross committed a similar foul on Wilfried Bony and referee Michael Oliver awarded a penalty

There needs to be consistency as this WWE-style behaviour creeps in

Awarding penalties for blocking would be a sure-fire deterrent
