A group of disabled people have stripped off for a daring new calendar celebrating the beauty of the human form.

The brave participants, who included Paralympic stars, followed in the footsteps of students, sports teams and Women's Institutes for the 'Undressing Disability' calendar.

Proceeds from the calendar will go towards a charity which encourages the disabled to enjoy fulfilling romantic relationships.

Brave: Nicola Miles-Wildin, who works for a pioneering theatre company, posed in her underwear and a red pair of boots; she uses a wheelchair because of her juvenile chronic arthritis

The models - who suffer from ailments such as cerebral palsy, blindness and deafness - posed in their underwear in front of London landmarks such as Tower Bridge and the Houses of Parliament.

Among those featured is Nicola Miles-Wildin, who appeared at the Paralympics opening ceremony reciting Shakespeare.

The 34-year-old wheelchair user, who has juvenile chronic arthritis, is an assistant artist with the Graeae Theatre Company, Britain’s only full-time professional theatre company made up of disabled people.

July sees an appearance by England’s first blind fitness instructor, James O’Driscoll. When he went blind almost overnight, he refused let his disability hold him back.

Instead, he determined to break into his chosen industry and was once named 'Man of the Month' by Men's Health magazine.

Mr O'Driscoll's story is so inspirational he ended up becoming a mentor to January's star, 23-year-old Josh Lancaster, who was born with cerebral palsy.

Sultry: 34-year-old Jennie Williams, from Brighton, contributed to the project which aims to celebrate the bodies of disabled people

Back seat: 51-year-old Mike, who is deaf, poses with Zoe and another star in the back of a taxi

While Mr Lancaster has limited movement on his left side, meeting the trainer through charity ‘Enhance the UK’ inspired him to pursue his life-long passion for the fitness and sport industry.

He now hopes to become a certified personal trainer himself, and is looking to feature in the 2016 Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro.

Also appearing is actress Kiruna Stamell, who played La Petite Princess in Baz Luhrmann’s Moulin Rouge and appeared in EastEnders as Sandra Fielding.

Celebration: Kiruna Stamell, a 31-year-old from Birmingham with restricted growth, and 38-year-old Gareth Berliner, who suffers from Crohn's disease

Behind the wheel: Mike drives a taxi around London dressed in very little as he shows off his 2012 Paralympics tattoo

Cheery: David, Josh, James, Gareth, Jennie, Charlotte and Kiruna during the good-natured photo shoot

Undressing Disability, a project by Enhance the UK aims to celebrate disabled bodies which are normally ignored by society.

Donations received from the calendar go towards the charity's sex education scheme.

The Undressing Disability calendar can be ordered from Enhance the UK.

On sale: Proceeds from the calendar will go to support sex and relationships education for disabled people
