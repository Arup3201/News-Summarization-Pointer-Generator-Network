Elections are sure to throw up eccentric characters from time to time with a colorful back story -  – but none quite like the candidates running for mayor in one Colorado town.

Voters in the mountain community of Divide have been deciding between various animals at the ballot box.

In total 11 have been competing for the title – seven dogs, one hedgehog, one cat, one horse and a donkey.

Paws for thought: The full list of candidates competing in the Divide election, which is running to raise money for the Teller County Regional Animal Shelter

The election, however, isn’t an official one, unsurprisingly.

It is actually being run to raise money for the Teller County Regional Animal Shelter and awareness for groups like Teller County Search and Rescue.

Each vote means $1 for the shelter, and voters have been clicking from round the country.

Election that has gone to the dogs: Pa Kettle the bloodhound is a favorite to win

Voting began in February, and chief operating officer Mary Steinbeiser says about $9,000 had been raised by Monday.

That will pay for scores of spaying or neutering operations.

Steinbeiser says she likes Pa Kettle the soulful-eyed bloodhound the best.

'Anyone of them would be a good mayor,' Marti Benson, a local vet, said.

Nancy Adams, the fundraising coordinator, said: 'Most of them say, "are you kidding?" And we say, "no. We're not kidding"'She added that the last election they held raised about $8,800 and the current one has surpassed $9,000, which will go towards helping hundreds of abandoned animals each year.
