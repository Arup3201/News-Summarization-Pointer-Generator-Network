Fears over a follow-up game to the deadly drinking craze Neknominate have grown after man, believed to be taking part, hurled himself backwards off a bridge.

Wetnominate sees revellers going to extreme lengths to get soaking wet before nominating a friend to do the same or go one better.

The game is worryingly similar to Neknominate, the sweeping drinking trend which killed three people after they downed litres of alcohol and posted videos and photos of it online.

The 20-year-old speaks to the camera before running towards the bridge's ledge in his underpants as cars stream passed 

Mr Price climbs over the railings of the bridge before turning himself round to launch into a back flip 

Among them users slammed Mr Price's dangerous behavior, writing: ' Nominating someone for crazy stunts like this is mad. 

Cynon Valley MP, Ann Clwyd and South Wales Police have spoken out against the 'dangerous' footage.

'You cannot jump from those heights into water - you don't know what's below or how deep it is.

'He could have been killed,' said Ms Clwyd.

'I'm glad he's not hurt but it should be a warning to everybody else. 

Mr Price flips himself off the bridge and plummets towards the water with his arms spread out widely 

He hurtles towards the water upside down before disappearing from view as lands in the river 

The 20-year-old posted this photograph of his scratched torso on Facebook after sharing the video

'People should absolutely not copy him,' she added.

A spokesman for South Wales Police said: 'This individual is putting himself in serious danger. 

'Of course, we advise against such reckless behavior which could have tragic consequences.'

Speaking after the video was posted online, Mr Price said he 'didn't regret' what he did. 

'I find [the attention] mad - I didn't think it was going to be so big.

'I don't regret it, no - it was a good rush. I've grown up jumping off that bridge and people shouldn't be so stupid as to copy me. I only did it because I've done it before,' he told ITV.

Bradley Eames, 20,  also died after taking part in the game created n Australia earlier this year 

Earlier this year Neknominate swept across groups of youths as a popular drinking game after being made up in Australia.

The dangerous trend saw revellers downing litres of alcohol on camera after being nominated to do so by someone on social media. 

Once finished, participants chose one or several others to follow suit or go one better. 

At least three people died as a result of Neknominate, the deadly drinking game which sees participants down copious amounts of alcohol before choosing others to follow suit. 

Bradley Eames died after downing almost two pints of gin while filming himself. The 20-year-old from Nottingham was found dead four days after posting the video in which he said: 'This is how you drink'. 

Isaac Richardson, 20, collapsed after drinking whiskey, wine, vodka and lager while taking part. After his death, it was revealed a group at a backpackers hostel in London had 'dared' him to carry out the feat. 

Stephen Brookes, 29, downed almost an entire bottle of vodka in his video. The rugby player was more than six times over the legal driving limit when he fell unconscious seconds after drinking the spirit. 

Nine-year-old Rhiannon Scully is thought to be the game's youngest victim. 

The child was hospitalised after drinking whiskey and vodka after seeing older friends' posting the video online. 

She had to have her stomach pumped and was monitored overnight but made a full recovery.
