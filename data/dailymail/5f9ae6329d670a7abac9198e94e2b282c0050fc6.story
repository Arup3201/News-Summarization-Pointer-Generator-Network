The Royal Navy is taking the fight to Ebola, with hospital ship Argus now docked in Sierra Leone with aid, supplies and vehicles.

The Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship has reached Freetown Port Dockside, complete with 32 UK-funded pick-up trucks which will be vital to keeping the hard-pressed Ebola treatment centres in action.

Brigadier Stephen McMahon described the operation as 'total war' on the virus.

He told The Times: 'It is a national threat. I think this is 'total war' in this country. It is a war of the people. It affects politics, infrastructure, economics and the lives of individuals on a daily basis... This is a fight for national survival against Ebola.' 

It reported that three Merlin helicopters had already been flying experts from the ship into the country as the ship approached the shoreline.

The trucks on the ship will be used to transport staff, medicines and equipment around Sierra Leone.

The ship has made the journey from a British naval base in Gibraltar, where it was loaded with its much-needed cargo earlier last week.

Defence Secretary Michael Fallon has described the RFA Argus mission as a sign of the nation's 'determination to lead the world's efforts to tackle the Ebola crisis'.

Captain David Eagles, commanding officer of RFA Argus, said: 'It has been a very busy passage south from the UK.

'Now that RFA Argus has arrived in country we are all looking forward to playing our part and doing our best to contribute to the DFID-led mission to contain the spread of the disease.'

Aircraft handler Mark Chapman, 33, said: 'Just a few weeks ago we were conducting exercises off the UK coast, so this is a complete change of programme and a step up in tempo, but this is what all the training is for.

'I joined the Navy to go on operations around the world, but it's not all about war-fighting, there is the humanitarian element too. I am proud to be in Sierra Leone where I think we will add real value.' 

Once she arrives, she is likely to spend up to six months there. 

In total, around 800 British military personnel are being deployed to help with the establishment of Ebola treatment centres and an Ebola training academy.

It comes as a scientist who helped to discover the Ebola virus revealed that he is concerned that the disease could spread to China given the large numbers of Chinese workers traveling to and from Africa.

Peter Piot, who is director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said on Thursday it's not 'rocket science' that with many exchanges between the two regions the disease could spread.

'The concern I have is that I don't think you can really stop people from traveling. These patients will show up in any country in the world, but China is quite vulnerable,' Piot said.

'The issue is: 'What is the quality, the standard of infection control?' In public hospitals in China, the ones that I've visited, the level of infection control is very poor,' he said.

But Piot said China's controls for infectious diseases have improved and authorities have become more open about public health risks since severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, broke out in southern China in 2002. SARS infected about 8,000 people worldwide, killing nearly 800.

Conversely, Japan has disease controls and hygiene that are up to international standards, but it needs to do more to help combat what has become not just an epidemic but a humanitarian crisis, said Piot, a board member of the Global Health Innovative Technology fund, a collaboration funded by the Japanese government, Japanese pharmaceutical companies and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

The fund supports research into treatments for malaria, tuberculosis, dengue and other so-called neglected tropical diseases. Piot said that despite the urgency of the crisis, it was crucial that funds going to those efforts not be diverted to work on Ebola.

Treating the Ebola outbreaks as a humanitarian crisis would help overcome worries over budgetary issues, he said. 

His comments came as the World Health Organization declared that Liberia, the countryworst-hit by an Ebola epidemic, may be seeing a decline in the spread of the virus.

WHO Assistant Director General Bruce Aylward said the number
of burials and new admissions had fallen and there was a plateau
in laboratory-confirmed cases, though he cautioned against
overly optimistic conclusions.
