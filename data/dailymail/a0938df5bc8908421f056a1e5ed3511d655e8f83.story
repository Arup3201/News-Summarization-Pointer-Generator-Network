Monday night's episode of hit drama Hawaii Five-O, which featured the story of a young girl being held captive for ten years, was broadcast as an eerily similar, real-life ordeal played out for three young women in Cleveland, Ohio.

The CBS drama about an elite police unit was on at 10pm (ET), shortly before the escape of Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight from ten years of captivity made the late-night news.

The three women - along with a six-year-old girl found at the property who is Miss Berry's daughter - were taken to hospital and are now at an undisclosed location.

Chilling: The episode of Hawaii Five-O showed a teenage girl trying to escape after being held captive - and was shown on the same night that three women escaped after a decade of captivity in Ohio

Caught: The kidnapper who held the young women is captured in the cop drama Hawaii Five-O at the end of the episode

The 22nd episode of Hawaii Five-O's 
third season began with the body of a teenage girl being found in the woods,
 who the detectives discover was abducted ten years before.

The 17-year-old 
had been killed after trying to escape from her locked room.

It is soon reported that another child has been abducted with the police team racing against the clock to find the child kidnappers.

The episode would have been filmed weeks in advance of its airing on Monday night but the scheduling made for an eerie coincidence.

The disturbing Cleveland captivity case also echoes the best-selling novel Room by Emma Donoghue. 

Best-seller: Emma Donoghue's book Room is about a mother and son held in captivity

Room tells the story of five-year-old Jack who is held captive with his mother after she was kidnapped from college at the age of 19.

They
 finally become free of 'Room' after Jack plays dead, then escapes and alerts a stranger.

The story
 charts Jack and his mother's difficulty  in re-adjusting to life outside 
captivity.

Emma Donoghue has previously said that she was inspired by the Fritzl case which came to light in April 2008.

Father Josef Fritzl had kept his daughter captive for 24 years in the sealed basement of his home in Austria where she had seven children and one miscarriage. 

Ariel Castro, 52, who owned the property in Cleveland where the women were held, and his brothers Onil, 50, and Pedro, 54, have been arrested.

Miss Berry managed to escape the home through a flap in the door on Monday and raised the alarm.

The disappearances of Amanda and Gina has captured the attention of the entire city of Cleveland for the past decade.

Their relatives have continually held vigils and kept the story alive in the press.

The three women were kidnapped on the same street and found at the home just three miles away as their alleged kidnappers hid in plain sight.

Neighbors said they often saw Castro walking with the six-year-old girl in the neighborhood.

Cleveland police believe the women were tied up in the home after they were snatched and local reports noted there were chains hanging from the ceiling.
