It’s the sort of meal that might have gone down well with John the Baptist.

But 21-year-old Stephen Oldham was less enthused to find a live locust crawling inside a bag of ‘ready to eat’ rocket salad he bought from a Sainsbury's store in Bath, Somerset.

The university architecture student filmed the fully-grown insect before going back to the store with the unopened £1 bag, which had contents that originated in Spain.

Shocking: Stephen Oldham found a live locust crawling inside a bag of ‘ready to eat’ rocket salad he bought from a Sainsbury's store in Bath, Somerset

Mr Oldham said: ‘I purchased a bag of rocket from Sainsbury's Bath and when I was unpacking my shopping noticed that there was a locust living in the bag.’

‘The person I spoke was quite humorous about it. Sainsbury's are now handling it.’

Mr Oldham posted a video of the locust on his Facebook page last Wednesday - which has since been viewed more than 3,500 times - with the caption: 'Today my salad came with extra protein.'

Similar incidents of locusts being found in supermarket salads in Britain were reported by Waitrose, Marks & Spencer and Tesco customers in April, May and July of last year.

A Sainsbury's spokesman said: ‘We've apologised to Steve for this.

'Clearly it should never have happened and we have contacted him to make it up to him.

‘Our supplier has stringent checks in place on the production line and we will be looking closely at how this occurred.’

In the Gospels of Mark and Matthew, John the Baptist is said to live off locusts and wild honey.
