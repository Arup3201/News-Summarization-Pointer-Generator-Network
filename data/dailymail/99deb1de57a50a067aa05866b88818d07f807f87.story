During term time, the corridors of Pocatello High School in Idaho are rammed with teenagers and teachers running between classes.

As the student body and faculty members left for winter break, the buildings quickly became deserted.

But it seemed that there may have been one occupant left. 

Haunting: Surveillance footage at Pocatello High School in Idaho showed the lights randomly

Surveillance footage picked up by staff as they returned from the holidays shows the lights inside the school  switching on and off at random intervals.

Then the video captures a shadowy figure mysteriously emerging from one of the doorways. 

It seems to move out into the corridor before returning back inside the classroom.

It is unknown what the image depicts, as the figure does not resemble a person.

Some have speculated that it could just dirt hanging in front of the camera lens, out of focus.

However, the school has a history of suspicious events.  

According to AOL, students and teachers have reported strange goings-on in the school after allegedly hearing whispers and strange noises.

Disturbing: It appears to move out into the corridor before returning back to the classroom 

Paranormal? Once the mystery object disappears, the lights go dark again on the surveillance monitor  

Some have also refused to be left alone in the school's auditorium because of a large shadow that looms in the ceiling.

The strange occurrences became so common that paranormal investigators were called in.

They determined that there had been six deaths on school grounds.

Staff also discovered that the school had burned down in 1914 and had to be completely rebuilt before reopening in 1918.

Past: After a number of students reported strange occurrences at the Idaho school, paranormal investigators were called in. They discovered six people had died on school grounds
