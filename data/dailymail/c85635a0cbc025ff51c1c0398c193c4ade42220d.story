Tim Sherwood and Jurgen Klinsmann have emerged as leading contenders for the Aston Villa vacancy as the struggling club begin their search for a successor to sacked Paul Lambert.

Villa are understood to have made initial contact with Sherwood, the former Tottenham head coach, who is one of a small number of available managers with recent Premier League experience.

Klinsmann, the current USA boss, is also under consideration with owner Randy Lerner a known fan of his work with the national team.

Extricating the former Germany international from his role across the Atlantic will be highly difficult, however, with the 50-year-old enjoying his life in California and keen to take his adopted country to the 2018 World Cup.

Chief executive Tom Fox was at Bodymoor Heath on Thursday compiling a list of suitable candidates, as concern grows over Villa’s Premier League future. The club hope a replacement for Lambert can be made before Stoke visit Villa Park in the Premier League on February 21.

Sherwood has been in the running for two previous jobs this season but has failed to agree terms. He came close to landing the West Bromwich Albion position last summer only for wage demands to prove an issue, while he appeared set for Queens Park Rangers until the move fell apart after the interview stage. It is understood he would be interested by the vacancy at Villa.

Paul Lambert was sacked on Wednesday as Villa manager with the club in the relegation zone 

Klinsmann is liked by Lerner and Fox, both Americans, and money would not be an issue in attempts to lure him to England. Klinsmann, though, turned down Tottenham before Mauricio Pochettino was appointed would need convincing. Glenn Hoddle is another name in the frame.

Villa desperately need fresh impetus to lift the mood and generate an instant lift in results after their slide into the bottom three. Avoiding relegation to the Championship is of utmost important.

But the club also want a manager who will commit to the long-term and help develop young players through the academy. Head of recruitment Paddy Reilly is assisting the search.

It has emerged that Lambert twice invited Lerner to sack him before the Villa owner finally pulled the trigger after defeat to Hull. Lambert raised the issue with Lerner last summer and then earlier this season but was asked to continue in the role.

Lambert left Villa on a sour note after being informed of his sacking via a phone call from Fox on Wednesday afternoon. The 45-year-old is thought to be hurt he was not told face-to-face, as Fox’s omission from his statement issued via the LMA indicated.

Lambert did thank Lerner and previous chief executive Paul Faulkner and insisted he understood fans’ frustrations at Villa’s malaise. ‘I always shared their view that the football club is too big not to be competing at the top end of the table. I hope that can happen,’ he said.

The Scot vowed to be back, adding: ‘You never stop learning in football management. My time as Villa manager will prove hugely beneficial in the next stage of my managerial career.’
