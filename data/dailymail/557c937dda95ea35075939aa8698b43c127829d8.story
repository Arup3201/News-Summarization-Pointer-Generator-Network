Oprah said she has 'tasted touched, sniffed and snuggled' her way through the new list of giveaways

Oprah Winfrey has sparked excitement with the news that her annual prize giveaway is returning after a two-year hiatus.  

With the help of fashion designers Michael Kors and Tory Burch, the chat show host selected an eclectic spread of gifts to include in her 'Favorite Things' contest, which launches this month.  

According to her website she 'tasted, touched, sniffed and snuggled' her way through hundreds of products, and gourmet pigs in blankets, a $192 lipstick set, and cotton pajamas were some of her top picks. 

Describing the $160 pajama set, Oprah, 58, said: 'I could live in these pajamas! The satiny pima cotton feels like you're wearing nothing.'  

Other items of clothing on the media 
mogul's wish list are colourful v-neck sweaters from Ralph Lauren 
($198), Coach puffer jackets ($458) and metallic high-top sneakers from 
Michael Kors ($195).  

And on the food front, there is black truffle sausage ($50), blue velvet cake ($42) and a trio of jams ($36).  

One
of the most expensive items to feature is a bright pink, 
Sixties-inspired electric scooter by Jetson Bike, which boasts a price 
tag of $1,800.  

'One charge of this sleek-looking 
electric bike's 'green' battery provides 40 miles of easy riding, but 
you can also pedal - which recharges the battery, gets you some 
exercise, and keeps you away from the gas pump,' says Oprah.  

The competition will launch on November 18 on Oprah's new television network OWN, which she launched last year.

During the two-hour special, titled Oprah's Favorite Things: 2012, she will also pull off a top-secret giveaway for an unsuspecting group of military wives.  

Viewers will also have the opportunity to 'watch and win' select items featured during the show.  

One fan wrote on her site, oprah.com: 'Thanks so much Oprah for putting smiles on the face of a lot of people, during these trying times.

While another added: 'What an amazing list of products for our friends & loved ones.

I'm always anticipating your list, as it helps me with my gift giving.'   Oprah launched her Favorite Things giveaway in 1996.

One of the biggest prizes has included a seven-day stay on the world's largest cruise ship. 

'Cruising, of course, is one of my favorite things,' Oprah told the audience at the time.

'And you are going to have the time of your lives.'  

More information on this year's contest will be included in O's December issue, on newsstands November 6.
