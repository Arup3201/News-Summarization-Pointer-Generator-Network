Andy Murray is likely to have to accept a considerable cut in payments when his new clothing deal is unveiled as his lucrative five-year deal with adidas comes to an end.

Murray is shortly expected to announce a new major sponsor, joining Laura Robson and James Ward on the clothing-go-round as British players’ on-court appearance change considerably in 2015.

Robson has also left adidas and gone to their fellow giants Nike, while Murray is expected to replace his expiring five year $15 million deal with an arrangement promoting a company less automatically associated with tennis.

It is believed that a frontrunner in negotiations has been American company Under Armour, who are more known in this country for their deal kitting out Tottenham Hotspur.

At present their tennis involvement has been limited, although they currently kit out rising American star Sloane Stephens and the veteran US journeyman Robby Ginepri. It could be that they see Murray as a good fit for their slightly edgier, sport-specific image.

Industry experts say that New Balance have also been interested in expanding their tennis presence, although last year they signed Canada’s Milos Raonic. Rumours that Murray might revert to his old clothing partner, Fred Perry, are reckoned to be inaccurate.

Regardless, the money is not likely to approach the $3 million per year that adidas have been paying the 27 year-old Scot over a period that took in his Wimbledon, US Open and Olympics triumphs.

The reduced upfront payment, perhaps barely half the previous sum according to industry observers, is partly due to him failing to reproduce that form in the year that saw him return from back surgery.

It is also recognition that he is heading into his late twenties and that adidas replica kit sales have not been as high as hoped in what is said to be a relatively depressed market overall at present. The new deal will have to take into account that he is likely to continue wearing adidas tennis shoes, as this has been his favoured footwear since he was a teenager.

Murray’s representatives did not wish to comment, although they confirmed that an announcement is expected in the next few weeks. His departure from adidas will top a year of change that saw Ivan Lendl, assistant coach Dani Vallverdu and fitness trainer Jez Green depart his team and Amelie Mauresmo installed at its head.

Whenever she reappears Robson will be wearing the swoosh instead of the three stripes. She is currently training in Florida and her return from long-term wrist problems is increasingly likely to be in the United States rather than at the Australian Open.

Emerging British No 2 Ward, who has risen to the cusp of the top 100, is expected to appear next year kitted out on court by Ted Baker.

Until now the well-known British brand, whose founder Ray Kelvin is a long-established tennis nut, has restricted itself to providing suits for players and British teams when out and about at official functions but they are now looking for deeper involvement.
