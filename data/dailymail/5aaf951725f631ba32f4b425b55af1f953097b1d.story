With wedding prices enough to make any couple wince, a charity stepped in to help 90 Turkish couples tackle the cost of tying the knot by organising a mass ceremony at a football club.

Attended by 3,500 guests, the enormous Muslim ceremony was held at a stadium in Reyhanli, Hatay Province, and organised by non-profit organisation the Konya Mehir Foundation as well as the local government.

The happy couples, all of them from low income families, were also given gifts of donated furniture, bedroom linens, crockery, clothing and even large household items such as refrigerators to help get their new lives together off to a good start.

Tackling the cost: The couples all came from low-income families and would have been unable to afford to get married without the help of charity Knoya Mehir Foundation and the area's local government

Many of the brides and their new grooms had been forced to postpone their nuptials because they had been unable to afford to get married.

Traditionally, Turkish weddings are attended by hundreds of guests with the celebrations stretching on for days, while the costs - usually met by the bridegroom's family - can reach into thousands of pounds.

Each of the 90 couples, who were also provided with flowers and food, had been chosen by the charity due to their financial situations.

Most of the brides wore white wedding dresses, paired with an array of headscarves, veils and tiaras, while many also wore a red sash around their waists - traditionally worn by Turkish brides as a symbol of virginity.

Among those making their vows were refugees who had been forced to leave their homes in Syria due to civil unrest in the country and flee to Turkey.

Those in attendance included relatives of the couples, Orhan Karasay from the local branch of Turkey's ruling AK Party, and the region's governor Yusuf Güler, while Foundation president Mustafa Özdemir gave a speech wishing the 90 couples well.

'Everything you need for the establishment of a nest was considered,' he said, telling them about the 20 items each couple were given as presents, according to Turkish news website Haber7.

Mr Özdemir told the assembled guests that the charity had so far been able to help 12,000 couples to marry, while the Reyhanli mayor Huseyin Şanver said that mass weddings had been held in the area since 2004, when 45 farmers took part in a ceremony.

Each of the couples said their vows individually in front of Mr Şanver, as in Turkey all legally-binding marriages must be civil ceremonies performed by an authorised wedding officer.
