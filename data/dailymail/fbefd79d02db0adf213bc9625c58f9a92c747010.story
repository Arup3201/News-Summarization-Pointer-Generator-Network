A closeted gay man who embezzled £170,000 from his employer has claimed that he used the money to pay off his wife after she started blackmailing him over his sexuality.

Christopher Brown is facing jail after being found guilty of exploiting his position as a finance director to write himself dozens of company cheques.

He told a court he stole the money in desperation when his then wife Mandy threatened to out him after she discovered he had been calling gay chatlines.

Brown, 54, claimed he spent the stolen funds on private school fees for the couple's son as well as buying his wife a ring and a new car.

Mrs Brown said she 'completely denied' her ex-husband's version of events, and has not faced any police action over his allegations.

Bournemouth Crown Court heard that Brown joined luxury home entertainment firm Dawsons in 1980, and worked there for more than two decades.

In 1997 Mrs Brown, his second wife, discovered a telephone bill which showed how he was regularly calling gay chatlines, the court heard.

He alleged that she had threatened to expose his double life unless he agreed to 'excessive spending' on their son's education and pricey gifts for her.

'I was desperate not to leave the family so I got into this financial mess,' Brown said.

The couple eventually split in 2003, at which point Brown left his job and moved from Lymington, Hampshire to France, where he opened a bed and breakfast with his male lover.

Soon afterwards Dawsons, which sells high-end products from brands such as Bang & Olufsen, discovered that £170,000 had disappeared from its accounts.

Brown refused to return to the UK for questioning, and a European Arrest Warrant for him was issued in 2009.

He was arrested by French police in October 2011, and extradited to Britain in April last year.

He denied stealing the money from Dawsons, insisting he had only ever intended to borrow it and claiming he had already repaid £120,000.

But he was found guilty on four counts of theft today, and a judge warned him that he should expect a prison sentence.

Brown was bailed ahead of sentencing, on condition that his first wife agreed to a £100,000 surety.

He is also subject to a curfew, has had to surrender his passport and must report to Lymington police station every week.
