This is the moment two thugs were filmed posing with a huge Rambo-style knife - just seconds before stabbing to death an innocent teenager.

Kelvin Wilhelm, then 26, had been out of jail for only one month when he and 23-year-old Anthony Ellis began playing with the 15-inch knife during a party at Ellis's mother's home in Manchester.

They were videoed terrorising partygoers with the hunting blade while donning stab vests and making 'gang' gestures, before getting into a row with 18-year-old John Muldowney.

Jailed: Wilhelm (left) was today sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 20 years after being found guilty of murder at Manchester Crown Court. Ellis (right) was handed a 10-year jail sentence for manslaughter

Wilhelm wrongly accused Mr Muldowney of stealing cannabis from him, ordered him to be strip searched and staged a ten second 
countdown in a bid to make him give back the device.

When he reached 'three', the thug began 
grappling with Mr Muldowney and while Ellis punched the victim, Wilhelm plunged the blade into his chest.

Wilhelm later misplaced the phone and police found the damning footage, taken by a female companion, as they examined the scene 
at the house in Benchill, Wythenshaw. 

Today, Wilhelm, now 30, was sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 20 years after being found guilty of murder in a retrial at Manchester Crown Court.

Victim: Mr Muldowney was stabbed in the chest

Ellis, now 27, was handed a 10-year jail sentence after being convicted of manslaughter.

The pair were originally jailed for life after being convicted of murder in December 2010.

But their convictions were last year overturned by Appeal Court judges who ruled the original jury had not been fully instructed on the issue of'murderous intent'.

Both men had denied all offences.

At the time of the killing in June 2010, police discovered that Wilhelm had been wanted for recall to prison after failing to comply with the conditions of his release.

The thug had been sentenced to 65 months for a knifepoint robbery at a house in January 2008, but was released early in May 2010 after serving only half his sentence.

Wilhelm and Ellis had become close friends and the younger man saw himself as a 'big man' and had adopted a 'no one can touch me attitude', the court heard.

A girlfriend of Ellis told how he and Wilhelm both 'egged each other on', how 'everybody else seemed to fade away into the background' and how 'it was all about them two'.

On the day of the killing, the pair, who were high on cocaine and booze at the time, had invited Mr Muldowney to a party at Ellis's house.

At the time, Ellis was feuding with south Manchester gangsters and had thrown a party at his mother's home to protect it from attack.

During the evening, Ellis was seen wearing the knife - which had 'teeth marks' on the top of the blade - under the waistband of his trousers.

He was then spotted waving the knife around aggressively, saying he was going to kill 'hoodlums' from a gang based in Moss Side, Manchester, the court heard.

Later in a bedroom, a female guest got hold to Wilhelm's phone and starting videoing him as he and Ellis drunkenly larked about with the knife.

Shortly before 3am, Wilhelm demanded that party guests took their trousers off after accusing them of stealing cannabis from him. While others agreed, Mr Muldowney did not.

This led to a struggle between Wilhelm, Ellis and the victim, during which neighbours could hear screams coming from the house.

Police and paramedics were called and Mr Muldowney was taken to hospital with a single stab wound to his chest. He was pronounced dead a short time later.

Ellis and two others who were still in 
the house were arrested. Wilhelm went to a police station the next day 
as he was wanted on recall to prison, and was arrested on suspicion of 
murder.

Sentencing Wilhelm, Judge David Stockdale QC told him: 'You have shown no remorse. The apparent remorse you demonstrated to the jury was a performance, and an unconvincing one at that.

'But you will have to live for the rest of your life with the knowledge you killed a young man who was your friend.'

In a statement, Mr Muldowney's mother Jeanette Toner said she was 'finding it difficult to put into words the pain I feel'.

She said: 'I love my five children all the same but John held a shine in my heart. He was a smart, clean, fresh faced young man with manners.

Case: Wilhelm and Ellis were initially convicted of murder in December 2010, but later successfully overturned the verdict at the Court of Appeal. They were today sentenced at Manchester Crown Court (pictured)

'No other pain has ever compared. No 
matter what happens to those who ended John’s short but precious life my
 heartache will never end.

'The re-trial has only served to open old wounds. Our suffering is no less, four years down the line.'

Detective Chief Inspector Graham Brock said he hoped today's sentenced would help Mr Muldowney's family to 'move on with their lives'.

'This was a gathering that turned rowdy in the most tragic of ways,' he said.

'Wilhelm’s actions were that of a violent man who was firstly threatening people he called his friends with a knife, and then showed he was willing to inflict a fatal stab wound on John.

'Ellis was complicit in the murder as he egged on Wilhelm and did nothing to stop the stabbing.

'Our thoughts remain with John Muldowney’s family who have had to endure a second trial. I hope the sentence today gives them some comfort and that they are able to move on with their lives.'
