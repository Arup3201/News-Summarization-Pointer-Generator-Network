A blind man was beaten around the face with a brick after he said hello to two men in the street.

Michael Chaplin and Darrell Hughes left the 21-year-old with multiple facial fractures after they hit him repeatedly with the brick.

The victim fled for his life as the two thugs then turned on his father, who had been walking home with his son.

The pair used a 'for sale' sign to beat him to the ground.

Chaplin, 21, and Hughes, 19, were jailed yesterday at Hull Crown Court for what the judge called 'an appalling episode'.

Chaplin and Hughes started the attack after the visually impaired man said 'alright lads' as he and his father walked him from watching an England football match on television.

The victim is partially sighted but registered blind.

After he fled he broke down in tears believing his father had been killed in the unprovoked attack near their home in Hull.

In a statement read to the court, the man said of the June attack: 'I was just terrified. I feared for my life and my dad’s life.

'My instinct was to flee. I know it’s not a very brave thing to do but I just thought I was going to die.

'I genuinely thought my dad was dead because they had said they were going to kill him.'

The court heard the attack began when Hughes spat at the blind man and shouted: 'I’ve just spat at you, what are you going to do about it?'

He then told the man’s father: 'I will stab you.'

Both Hughes and Chaplin punched the blind man in the face as his father tried to lure them away.

Hughes ran after the father and beat him six times with the sign. Hughes and Chaplin kicked him more than 20 times, before stealing his shoes.

Chaplin, who knew the son was blind, then picked up a brick and struck him with it three times in the face.

The son ran home believing his father had been killed.

In his statement, the son said: 'I was running into pitch darkness and I just thought they were going to kill me.'

The court heard he managed to find his way home, as the attack happened in nearby Spring Bank.

'They told me to run and I didn’t stop running until I got home,' he said.

'When I got home my dad wasn’t there and I thought he was dead. I cried my eyes out, I was hysterical.'

Meanwhile, his father managed to escape and was frantically looking for his son.

When he staggered home in bare feet and found his son, he collapsed and an ambulance was called.

The father suffered cuts to his eye and swelling to his face.

The attack happened as the father and son walked home from the city after an England football match on TV.

Chaplin, of Ella Street, west Hull, pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm on the son and assault occasioning actual bodily harm on the father and has been jailed for five years.

Hughes, of Peel Street, west Hull, admitted wounding the son and assault occasioning actual bodily harm on the father and has been jailed for three years.

Judge Jeremy Richardson QC told them: 'There was no provocation for your conduct.

'Chaplin, you picked up a brick and hit him - a visually impaired young man - three times in the face.

'He fell and was kicked. He was utterly terrified for his life.

'This appalling episode would be appalling for anyone without disabilities but for a young man with a visible impairment, it was much, much worse.

'You both set about his father.

'The injuries to the son were serious but they could have been much worse. He was particularly vulnerable due to his disability and it was a sustained attack upon him.

'This crime was in a public place late at night when individuals and members of the public should be expected to return home without being set upon by violent thugs.

'Both of you deserve to be punished severely for what you did.

'You showed no mercy to your victims and you deserve little mercy yourselves.'

Chaplin has a previous conviction for causing actual bodily harm in 2008 when he headbutted a man as his friend filmed it.

Hughes has a conviction for battery after he punched his father last year and grabbed his mother by the throat.
