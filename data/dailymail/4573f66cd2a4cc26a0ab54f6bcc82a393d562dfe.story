Mauricio Pochettino has ordered his Tottenham players to be more aggressive after they slumped to a dismal defeat at home to West Brom at the weekend.

Spurs face Nottingham Forest on Wednesday night in the Capital One Cup, with Pochettino expecting his players to show more energy and fight than they did in the league.

It has been a disappointing start to his reign at the club, after replacing Tim Sherwood in the summer, and he is demanding that his players do something about it.

Pochettino said: 'We need to move the ball quicker, faster. West Brom played a long ball and to try to win the second ball. Maybe we have problem because the second ball we arrive late always, we arrive a lot of time to late in the box of the opposition. We need to be more aggressive in the last third of the pitch.

'We had the possession more than 60 per cent, after we need all we create from the back and build, we need to be more aggressive. We are in the moment we need to set our style and philosophy. This is a normal process, it is maybe up and down in the beginning, but we need to be strong and to carry on and to work hard and believe in our way.

'We are ready to compete and to fight against Forest because we expect a tough game.'

Spurs won their opening four games of the season under the Argentine, but have now drawn two and lost two of their last four.

But Pochettino insisted that the job is not bigger than he anticipated when he arrived in the summer.

He added: 'No not really. When we arrive here we know the situation. We know that maybe happen up and down in different period. Always different when you arrive at a new club with different players you need time to get to know each other. 

'I'm not worrying about the situation. I believe at the moment to we need to have more points to reflect the table, it's the beginning of the season, it's not how we start it's how we finish. We are sure our team will improve not only in how we play but in the results in the next few weeks.'
