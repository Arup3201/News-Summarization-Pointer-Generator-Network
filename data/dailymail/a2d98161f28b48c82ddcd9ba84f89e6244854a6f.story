Running the country is like being stuck in an ‘asteroid shower’, David Cameron has complained.

The Prime Minister revealed his struggle to cope with the bombardment of questions on foreign affairs.

And while trying to deal with global problems he also has to contend with his gaffe-prone ministers going off message.

Pressure: David Cameron told students of the Indian Institute of Management Calcutta about the challenges of being Prime Minister

Mr Cameron has already used his trip to India to air his grievances with life at the top, grumbling about having to make compromises with the Lib Dems and not getting a Tory majority.

But speaking to students in Calcutta he revealed how the blizzard of issues which are thrown at him can leave him struggling to cope.

He said: ‘It’s like sometimes being in a sort of asteroid shower, things flying at you every day.

‘You know, “Should you go to Sri Lanka?”, “What are you going to do about the famine in the Philippines?”, “Why has this minister done that?’ All these things are coming at you”.’

Mr Cameron said he coped by having a firm idea of what he is trying to achieve while in government or he will lose his way. ‘You’ve got to have a plan,’ he said.

Earlier the Prime Minister admitted that the coalition government has made decisions that are not in the national interest.

He said the Liberal Democrats have forced him into adopting policies that could damage Britain 'in the long term'.

Shower: Cameron said he had to deal with a flurry of questions about international crises and gaffe-prone ministers

But Deputy PM Nick Clegg hit back, insisting blocking some Tory policies was the 'right' thing to do.

With 18 months to go until the general election, both parties have begun striking out to provide greater ‘differentiation’ from their coalition partners.

The Conservatives have placed greater emphasis on crime, immigration and Europe while the Lib Dems have focussed on the environment and blocking visa curbs.

Speaking in Delhi, Mr Cameron told an audience of politicians and businessmen: 'I would prefer not to have a Coalition.

'We’ve shown it can work. And actually the good parts of Coalition are because you have these arguments within government and you have to proceed on a rational basis – that’s good.

'I think what’s bad about it is that sometimes you have to make compromises that are not necessarily in the long-term interests of the country.'

But Mr Clegg was defiant about his role in blocking Conservative policies to allow employers to fire at will, allow schools to make profits and giving spy agencies more powers in the Snooper’s Charter.  to be shelved.

'Of course there are compromises that the Conservatives have made that they don’t like,' he said on his weekly LBC 97.3 radio phone-in.

'I so happen to think that with the Liberal Democrats in coalition government, we have not only proved that coalition government works but that it is still anchored in the centre ground.'
