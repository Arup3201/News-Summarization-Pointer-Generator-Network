Apple is urging European iPhone customers to exchange their power adapters after an overheating issue was discovered.

Adapters for the iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S models, shipped from October 2009 to September 2012, ‘may overheat and pose a safety risk’ the company said.

Customers in the EU with a 5W USB power adapter matching this description are urged to take it to an Apple Store, where they will be given a replacement free of charge.

Apple is urging owners of an iPhone 3GS, 4 or 4S (stock image shown) in the EU to exchange their USB chargers for a new model at any Apple store. Adapters bought from October 2009 to September 2012 were found to have a fault that could cause to overheat and pose a safety risk

Customers in the UK are not affected.

To find out if an adapter is susceptible to the fault, customers are told to look at the label between the pins of the plug.

Researchers at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology have unveiled an experimental wireless recharging system that could top up the mobile of everyone in an office wirelessly.

The system can transmit power up to 16ft (five metres), charge up to 40 phones at a time, and is even powerful enough to run a TV.

Called the 'Dipole Coil Resonant System', it is believed to be the longest range wireless power system developed so far.

'The way electronic devices receive their power has changed tremendously over the past few decades, from wired to non-wired,' the researchers say.

Affected adapters are ‘Model A1300’ and have the letters CE in solid grey.

This will be replaced with a Model A1400, with the letters CE outlined in grey.

‘Customer safety is always Apple’s top priority, and we have voluntarily decided to exchange every affected power adapter for a new, redesigned adapter, free of charge,' the company wrote on its support page.

‘We encourage customers to exchange any affected adapter for a new one as soon as possible using the exchange process below.'

They continue: ‘If you have an affected adapter, discontinue use and exchange it for a new one.’

‘Apple has voluntarily introduced a program
 for customers to exchange the Apple 5W European USB Power Adapter which
 came with iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S models through September 
2012.

This, they say, is ‘because in rare cases the adapter may overheat and pose a safety risk.’

The European USB power adapter came with iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S models shipped from October 2009 to September 2012.

It was also sold as a standalone accessory.

The charger was sold in 37 countries including Albania, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Israel and Italy.

It was also sold in Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and Vietnam.

The affected USB adapters are the model A1300s, shown on the left. These also have the letters CE written in grey. The fixed adapter is shown on the right, which is a model A1400 and has the letters CE only outlined in grey. Owners of the adapter on the left are urged to exchange the plug at an Apple store

The affected two-pin plug, shown here, is used only by the iPhone 3GS, 4 and 4S in the EU. On their website Apple said: 'Customer safety is always Apple's top priority, and we have voluntarily decided to exchange every affected power adapter for a new, redesigned adapter, free of charge'

The announcement follows similar problems for the tech giant.

In late April, the Cupertino-based company admitted to the existence of a problem with the sleep/wake button on the iPhone 5.

Two years after customer complaints began appearing online, the Cupertino-based company launched a free replacement scheme for any users affected by the power button issues.

Apple said a ‘small percentage’ of iPhone 5 handsets had faulty mechanisms that can lead to problems with the switch.

The fault prevents the device from being turned on and off, or locked in the usual way.

This caused some iPhone models to stop working intermittently.
