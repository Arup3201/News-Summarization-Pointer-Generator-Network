A male porn star has taken the blame for the current syphilis outbreak that has closed down the adult film industry in Los Angeles.

After Mr Marcus contracted the bacterial infection on set, he altered his syphilis-positive test so he could continue performing.

The 18-year veteran actor’s admission came after the industry’s self-imposed 10 day moratorium which has seen more than 1,000 performers in the Los Angeles area get tested and administered preventative antibiotics.

Jailed: Porn star Mr Marcus has been sentenced to 30 days in jail after continuing to work after contracting the bacterial infection

At least nine porn stars have revealed they have contracted syphilis.

According to XBiz Mr Marcus said: ‘I tried to cover it up…because I said it was like the scarlet letter. It’s the word. Syphilis, whoa.

‘Mr Marcus, syphilis? Mr Marcus, the one I worked with? The one that everybody works with? The one that’s been in this industry forever?’

Returned to work: His doctor said Mr Marcus would not be contagious 10 days after a pencillin shot so he returned to work at porn shoots after 11 days

A doctor told Mr Marcus that he would not be contagious 10 days after taking a shot of penicillin on July 13.

With that diagnosis he returned to 
work 11 days later, on July 24, still with syphilis.

Instead of 
presenting a paper or digital copy of the test results he showed the 
producer a copy on his phone so the details about the infection were not
 visible.

While filming 
another porn film, Mr Marcus said he folded the test to hide the 
syphilis diagnosis and photocopied it but a producer noticed the results
 were missing and questioned him about it.

He said: ‘I have to live with this, no one else does.

‘I’m very sorry. I did not think that this would come out like this.’

The
 porn star posted on Twitter yesterday: ‘You can be disappointed, but 
don't throw stones. Some of you are living in glass houses.’

The actor said that three women he performed with after his diagnosis have all tested negative for syphilis.

The bacterial infection has a 90-day 
incubation period meaning a porn actor could potentially be carrying the disease 
without it showing up on tests.

Cover up: The porn star tried to hide his diagnosis because it was 'like a scarlet letter', leaving out the positive test results when showing producers a photocopy of his blood test. Yesterday he tweeted after his admission

Porn star Aletta Ocean, 24, said on Tuesday that she contracted syphilis while shooting movies in Budapest, Hungary.

Her revelation led to speculation that the outbreak of the disease came from Hungary.

According to porn industry blog LukeIsBack.com she tweeted: 'F****** siphilis problem… In Budapest many people got it..Me too…’

Sex workers are supposed to undergo regular blood tests to ensure they are free of sexually transmitted disease.

It was reported that one of the labs frequented by porn stars does not test for syphilis.

Syphilis is a treatable bacterial infection that can be spread by both bodily fluids and contact with infected skin. 

Its causes skin lesions and rashes. If left untreated, it can permanently alter and damage internal organs and brain function.

The number of syphilis cases in 
California has jumped 18 per cent according to a recent report from the 
California Department of Public Health.

The results showed a much higher rate
 of men had contracted the infection and that African Americans were 
affected more than any other racial demographic.

The
 outbreak is likely to bolster a ballot issue in November that aims to 
force all porn performers to wear condoms during pornography shoots.

Condom use has become of political issue in Los Angeles since a 2010 
AIDs outbreak, which infected one performer.
