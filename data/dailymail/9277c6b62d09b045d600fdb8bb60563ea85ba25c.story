Norwich are interested in signing goalkeeper Davide Bassi from Italian club Empoli as a possible replacement for John Ruddy, who they fear may leave the club this summer.

The Canaries also have an interest in Leeds United striker Ross McCormack.

Leeds owner Massimo Cellino completed the sale of his former club Cagliari on Wednesday for around £35m. 

Safe hands: Empoli goalkeeper Davide Bassi is wanted by Norwich as they prepare for life in the Championship

Ruddy, who missed out on a place in England's World Cup squad this summer has already been linked to Arsenal and Crystal Palace.

Last summer he rejected the chance to join Chelsea as back-up to Petr Cech, preferring to play regular first-team football.

McCormack came close to joining Cardiff in January and finished as the top scorer in the Championship with 28 goals.

With uncertainty surrounding the futures of Ricky van Wolfswinkel and Gary Hooper at Carrow Road the club are keen to bolster their attacking options further and add to the signing of Lewis Grabban from Bournemouth for an undisclosed fee.

Bradley Johnson, Robert Snodgrass, Luciano Becchio and Jonny Howson have all left Leeds for Norwich in recent seasons.
