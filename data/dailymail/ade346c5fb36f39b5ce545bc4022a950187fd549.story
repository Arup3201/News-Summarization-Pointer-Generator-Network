The murder of a 28-year-old mother of two, who was found dead in her home by her fiancé, has shocked the Michigan community where she was a popular waitress and known for being the life of the party. 

Frances Craig was due to be married in just a month and a half when Eric Wolfe found her dead in their house in a quiet neighborhood of Jackson, Michigan, last Sunday. 

Detectives haven't said how Miss Craig died, but say they don't believe her murder was random, the Jackson Citizen Patriot reports. 

Eric Wolfe found his fiancee Frances Craig dead when he returned home on Sunday. The couple were due to be married at the end of September

Miss Craig was a popular waitress at a local sports bar. Her co-workers are pooling their tips tonight and the owner is kicking in money to help pay for her funeral

The mystery of her murder has left her neighbors shaken and searching for answers. 

'It's totally out of left field. The only activity we have back here is a lot of deer,' neighbor Kevin Barkholz told the newspaper. 

Miss Craig was a waitress at The Chase sports bar in Jackson, where she was known for her 'bubbly' personality. The owner of the bar, Randy LeMaster, said she became like family in a matter of a few months.

The waitresses are pooling together their tips at the bar tonight to donate to Miss Craig's family to help pay her funeral expenses. Mr LeMaster has promised to match whatever his employees raise.

'She was full of life, always smiling always joking. She was one of those people that no matter how bad of a mood you were in, she would make you feel better,' Miss Craig's friend Heather Schaffer told the Citizen Patriot.

Friends say Mr Wolfe was heartbroken to find his fiancee dead

Miss Craig was just five days away from her 29th birthday when she was killed. She was set to marry Mr Wolfe on September 27. 

Mr Wolfe's friend, Todd Picket, took to Facebook to support the family: '(Mr Wolfe) was to be married this coming month to Francis Craig. Unimaginably he returned home this past Sunday to find her lifeless in the home they shared. Her death has been ruled a homicide! She leaves behind two beautiful little girls as well as Eric's little girl she was soon to be a step mother to.'

'All she ever talked about was her girls and marrying Eric,' her friend Ms Schafer said.
