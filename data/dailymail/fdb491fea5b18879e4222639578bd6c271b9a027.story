Customers who have been without power for 48 hours or more over the Christmas period will receive £75 as a 'goodwill gesture', it has been confirmed today.

UK Power Networks, which owns electricity lines and cables in London, the south east and east of England, said it will treble the standard compensation payment of £27 for those who are still in the dark.

The company said today 481 customers in Kent were without power, along with 96 in Surrey and 251 in Sussex.

A spokesman from UK Power Networks said last night: 'As a gesture of goodwill UK Power Networks has decided to boost 
the industry standard payment from £27 to £75 for customers who are 
without power for 48-60 hours including Christmas Day, and additional 
payments will be made to any customers off supply for longer up to a 
maximum of £432.'

Director of customer services Matt Rudling said: 'This is such a difficult time of year for people to be without power and so many families have also been flooded out of their homes.

'Our hearts go out to our customers and we have been trying different ways to help them, from arranging Christmas dinners to providing more help and tools on our website.'

When the high winds struck on Thursday night, more than 300,000 customers were initially without power.

Around 4,000 are thought to still be in the dark - many in the south east.

Yesterday, a resident of Yalding, Kent, where homes had been severely damaged and many remain without power, vented their frustration at Prime Minister David Cameron.

In
 a heated on-camera exchange with the PM, the woman said: 'We still have
 no electric. We need electric. As I say the council, from Monday we 
have been trying to contact them, but they have all decided to go on 
their holidays. Nothing.'

It is thought thousands of Christmas presents - such as tablet devices and computers - will still be in their boxes, as continued electricity black-outs deem them unusable. 

Power companies have been widely 
condemned for failing to restore supplies to thousands of people - some 
who had been without electricity since Christmas eve.

Electricity North West (ENW) said 1,000 customers were without power in Cumbria this afternoon after engineers had restored more than 20,000 properties across the region.

Meanwhile in Wales, 1,100 properties - mainly in Anglesey and Gwynedd - have no electricity following the storms, a spokesman for Scottish Power said.

UK Power Networks said 481 customers in Kent were without power, along with 96 in Surrey and 251 in Sussex.

A spokesman for the company said: "Due to the severity of the storm damage it may take until the end of the week to restore power supplies to the final single premises affected in these areas, though work is continuing to reconnect most of the remaining supplies as quickly as possible."

Around 35,000 homes were last night without power across the Republic of Ireland after being battered by Thursday night's storm.

ScottishPower said it had now reconnected 14,500 customers who lost power during Thursday night's storm.

Spokesman
 Simon McMillan said: 'The biggest issue affecting the electricity 
network has been uprooted trees and other debris blown on to overhead 
power lines, which has caused damage and brought down the power lines in
 some areas.

'The company will do all that it can to restore supplies as quickly as possible.

'However, a number of roads and bridges have been blocked and closed by fallen trees which could restrict access in certain locations, and where wind speeds remain high engineers will not be able to climb poles and work at height.'

Robin Gisby, managing director of network operations at Network Rail, said this week 'has been one of the most challenging periods we have faced in recent times'.

The total number of flood warnings in 
place across England and Wales is currently 24, with the number of flood
 alerts at 86, The Environment Agency said this morning.

Thursday night's storms meant that several trains were delayed yesterday morning so lines could be examined in daylight before trains set off.

The line from London to Portsmouth 
via Haslemere is blocked by four landslips near Liphook, and will stay 
closed over the weekend.

The track at Ockley between Horsham and Dorking is also closed following a serious landslip.

A
 spokesman for the Rail Delivery Group, which speaks for the rail 
industry, said: 'We'd like to apologise to passengers whose journeys 
over the festive period have been affected by the bad weather of the 
last few days.

'Hundreds of rail staff have been working round the clock to clear tracks but some services have started later than planned to ensure passengers can complete their journeys safely.'

North West Ambulance Service (NWAS) took to Twitter to warn people about going outside in the gales.

A spokeswoman said the service had taken half a dozen calls in Lancashire alone about people being blown over by the wind, though only minor injuries were reported.

NWAS said that, as a precaution, people should stay indoors, out of the windy weather.

Conservative MP for Hastings and Rye, Amber Rudd, criticised Southeastern trains for failing to provide a replacement bus service for her constituents in the commuter belt towns.

While Southern Rail was offering workers the option of commuting to London via bus and even using Twitter to post regular updates, Southeastern services, including their communications, had been 'lamentable', she said.

Wet weather: Two people dodge a wave at Saltcoats Harbour, Scotland, yesterday

'So Southern have really done very well,' said Ms Rudd. 'I think it's partly because they've got Gatwick Airport on their tail wanting a better service.

'But Southeastern has not been anywhere near as good, and I have received a lot of complaints about them. They have been just too complacent'.

The RAC has reported a 20 per cent increase in breakdowns across the country, rising to a 40 per cent increase in the south and south east between Christmas Eve and yesterday.

A combination of storms and floods, congestion caused by shoppers hitting the Boxing Day sales and those heading home after the Christmas break, have all contributed to the spike in breakdowns over the last few days.

Sarah Rice, an RAC spokeswoman, said: 'We are maintaining increased levels of both patrol and support team hours as we prepare for the onslaught of shoppers over the busy sale weekend.

'The anticipated early return to work on Monday inevitably sees high volumes of breakdowns.'

The RAC advises motorists to give cars a five mile drive to test the battery, check tyre pressures and tread, coolant and screen wash levels, and make sure the windscreen wipers are working properly.

Desperate: Rose Gusterson, 84 , who has been without electicity since Christmas Eve

BY REBECCA EVANS

For four days and four nights, 84-year-old Rosina Gusterson has been without power.

The frail pensioner, a retired carer who suffers from severe arthritis, has had no heating in her council-owned flat other than the pitiable amount emitted by her gas cooker hob since Christmas Eve.

Islington Council, who own her block of flats in North London, offered to put Mrs Gusterson and her live-in daughter Ann Becouarn, 57, up in a hotel.

However, they were told they could not bring their beloved 14-year-old Cocker Spaniel, Jarvis, so felt they had no choice but to stay put.

Mrs Becouarn said: 'We haven’t been able to have a wash for days, we are so desperately cold.

‘We sit huddled around the hob and managed to have some mash potato on Christmas Day.

‘I do not understand why it has taken so long to fix our power, it has made my mother very ill.

‘She loves her dog, as do I, and there was no way we were leaving him.

‘The council said they would try to find us a hotel where they take dogs, but no-one ever got back to us.

‘We are not on benefits, we pay our rent so I do not understand why we have been left like this. I don’t know how much longer we can last.’

Mrs Gusterson, a widow, said: ‘We didn’t have a choice because the hotel doesn’t take pets. So I’ve been forced to live in dark, dreary and dangerous conditions because the council can’t find somewhere for Jarvis.

‘They told us “You go to the hotel and we’ll get the dog warden t pick up Jarvis and leave him at a dog’s home”.

‘I said there must be some way to keep us all together- we just can’t leave him. I explained he’s 14, he’s very deaf and not well, but they weren’t interested.

The flat lost its power during the storms on Christmas Eve.

A spokesman for Islington Council last night said they did not know when their electricity would be installed.

But added: ‘Above all, we want our residents to be safe and warm - and their pets looked after. We have offered transport to a comfortable local hotel on full board, and free kennelling through our animal welfare service. It simply hasn't been possible to find a hotel at short notice prepared to take a dog.’
