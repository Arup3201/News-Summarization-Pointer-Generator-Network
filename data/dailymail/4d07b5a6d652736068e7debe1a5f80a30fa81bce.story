A Russian prostitute wept today as she was jailed for kicking a 69-year-old client to death in his own home after a sex session turned violent.

Natalia Woolley was acquitted of murdering retired accountant Winston Fernandez but convicted of his manslaughter and jailed for three years.

She had told jurors that Mr Fernandez was drunk, dirty and smelly, locked her in, and then made 'disgusting' sexual demands of her, turning angry and violent when she refused.

She tried to escape and kicked out at his chest and fell onto him as she tried to break free from his clutches, she claimed.

He suffered two broken bones in his neck, 17 broken ribs and widespread bruising.

His
decomposing body was found slumped in his bedroom nearly a month later 
by police officers, alerted by a concerned acquaintance.

Jurors accepted Woolley’s account but felt that the level of violence she used had gone beyond self-defence.

Judge Christopher Critchlow told the pretty blonde that he was passing the least sentence possible in all the circumstances.

He told her: 'I’m quite satisfied you had no intention that he should die.

'I
bear in mind also there was a high degree of provocation by his 
behaviour, that this took place with no premeditation and that he was a 
man who could behave in a strange way with an escort girl.'

'Alluring to all men': Natalia Woolley, 38, who described 
herself on escort websites as 'incredibly sexy 
and curvacious', was convicted of killing 69-year-old Winston Fernandez

Police
were called to the house in, in Epsom, Surrey, on February 13, this 
year, and they found Indian-born Mr Fernandez dead in his bedroom, 
surrounded by signs of a struggle.

Detectives
uncovered evidence that the retired accountant had been using escort 
girls for company and sex increasingly in the final years and months of 
his life.

His wife had died in 2000 and he was estranged from his two sons and had few friends.

He was also a chronic alcoholic, the court heard.

A
handyman who removed six builder’s bags full of empty bottles from the 
garage on the day Mr Fernandez died said he 'barely made a dent' in the 
collection.

Trial: Woolley claimed she had acted in self-defence after the pensioner made 'disgusting' sexual demands of her, the court heard

With numerous 
physical and mental health problems, the victim was known to be 
difficult and abusive, even proving a nuisance to emergency services 
with calls to police and the ambulance service.

Not
long before his death another escort girl’s driver had to return to 
help her after Fernandez locked her in and threatened to smash her phone
with a hammer, jurors heard.

Woolley,
who was separated from her English husband, with whom she has a 
daughter living with her mother in Russia, went by the names Lenka and 
Alice on the websites of 24carat escorts and Diamond Escorts.

Described
as 'incredibly sexy' and 'all things to all men' on the sites, she was 
also listed as being 10 years younger than her real age.

She had seen Mr Fernandez three times before she visited him on January 16 this year - the fateful night.

On that occasion she was working independently and took a taxi from her home in West Kensington, London, to his home.

Early next morning she was at a petrol station in Epsom, using their phone to call for a taxi home.In the coming days and weeks she asked a friend to stay at their home and also for others to drive her to Epsom.

She confided that she had trouble with a client or that she had had a fight and wanted to check that the other person was okay.

After she was cleared of murder, Woolley began to weep as the jury returned the guilty verdict to manslaughter.

Her
barrister, David Lederman QC, told the judge at Guildford Crown Court: 
'The jury must have found there was a stage when the defendant behaved 
in such a way that what she was doing was not in self-defence, that the 
self-defence became offence, but not with the intention to kill or cause
grievous bodily harm.

'It 
is quite obvious that this lady, who is a professional escort lady, did 
not deliberately go to that house with the intention of beating up this 
man.

'We have a man who has a history of behaviour which is consistent with some form of provocation, to which she overreacted.

'It is not beyond speculative guesswork to say that a younger man would have survived the attack.'

Scene: Woolley is accused of murdering 69-year-old Winston Fernandez after he invited her to his £1million mansion (above) in Epsom, Surrey. She is accused of kicking and stamping the widower to death

The judge condemned her for leaving Mr Fernandez and not calling for help but he recalled the damning evidence about the victim.

He told Woolley: 'I’m quite satisfied he could be a difficult man and awkward and obsessive.

'On this night he was very drunk, having been drinking all day.

'The account of what took place that night comes from you and I bear in mind your lack of previous convictions.

'It
went wrong and as a result of his behaviour or you not wanting to do 
what he wanted you to do because he was smelly, possibly smelling of 
urine, and dirty, there was a struggle between you.

'You tried to leave and he tried to prevent you, and in the course of you trying to free yourself you kicked him.'

Despite mitigating factors he said there must be an immediate term of imprisonment.
