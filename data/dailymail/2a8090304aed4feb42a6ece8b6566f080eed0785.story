Real Madrid defender made the most of a rare free weekend before the start of the new season by attending the wedding of his brother Rene on Sunday.

The Spain star, who endured a nightmare World Cup with Vicente del Bosque's side, looked to have put his disappointment well behind him as he posed for pictures with his partner Pilar Rubio at Castillo de Vinuelas in Madrid.

Ramos was clearly thrilled to be in attendance as he shared a picture of himself with his mother and Rene on Twitter, along with the message: 'Just about to take him to the altar... I love you bro... Be very happy. You deserve the best'

Rene was tying the knot with former Miss Spain Vania Millan, who arrived at the exclusive venue in a classic car.

Ramos, who is set to resume his place in the heart of Carlo Ancelotti's defence next season, may well be planning nuptials soon after having a baby with his long-term partner Rubio earlier this year.

The TV presenter gave birth to Sergio Ramos Junior - their first child together - back in May.
