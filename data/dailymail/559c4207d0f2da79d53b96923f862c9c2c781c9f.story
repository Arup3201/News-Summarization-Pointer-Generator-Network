Five people were killed and 11 injured after a three-alarm fire broke out at the Wedgwood Senior Living Apartments in San Antonio, Texas, on Sunday morning, officials at the scene said.

Firefighters evacuated the building by carrying some elderly residents out windows and down ladder trucks from the 11-story building.

The building is home to some 700 residents and somewhere between 75 and 120 elderly residents were carried out.

At least one of the injured is in critical condition at an area hospital.

The cause of the fire is still not known and MySA reports that the building's sprinkler system didn't work.

Witnesses said there was smoke pouring from the back of the building. SAFD Police Chief Charles Hood said the third floor of the building was completely gutted and that doors were charred.

The fire started around 6:30am and a total of 150 firefighters from San Antonio and area municipal fire departments responded to the fire.

Those killed in the blaze have not yet been identified.

An evacuation center was established at Churchill High School nearby and family members are encouraged to check there about elderly relatives.

According to television news reports, San Antonio Fire Chief Charles Hood said evacuating the residents was hindered because of the building's construction.

It's the worst catastrophe in my knowledge to happen in Castle Hills,' said Time Howell, mayor of the city of approximately 4,300.

Castle Hills was the main fire department responding.

The Castle Hills City Manage Diane Pfeil said there were efforts underway to send blankets to Churchill High School and that Castle Hills Police would be in charge of making sure medications were distributed.
