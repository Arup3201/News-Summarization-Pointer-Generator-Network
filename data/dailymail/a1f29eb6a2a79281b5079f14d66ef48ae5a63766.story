One of the officers injured during a shooting at Los Angeles International Airport was helping an elderly man escape gunfire when he was shot twice.

Tony Grigsby, 36, who has been a Transportation Security Administration officer for nine years, was hit in the right foot during Friday's attack.

Despite being wounded, he told NBC News his main concern was making sure the terrified people running towards him were okay.

Courage: Tony Grigsby was shot twice in the right foot during Friday's attack at Los Angeles airport

Speaking outside his home, Mr Grigsby, who needed the help of a cane to stand up, said he was trying to help an elderly man get to safety when the gunman shot him.

Mr Grigsby was a friend of Gerardo Hernandez, the officer who was killed.

He fought back tears as he called Mr Hernandez a wonderful person who will be missed.

The pair were joking about going on holiday together to Mexico before Mr Hernandez was shot dead.

Meanwhile, the school teacher shot when the gunman opened fire is recovering well according to friends and colleagues.

Brian Ludmer is still being treated at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Centre and has to undergo one more operation. 

The 29-year-old is a teacher at Calabasas High School where he has worked in the performing arts department for 18 months. 

He was in Terminal 3 on Friday morning when the shots were fired.

A bullet hit Mr Ludmer's leg which shattered two bones. 

According to Catherine Foss, principal of the school, he looked straight into the gunman's eyes as he fell to the ground but managed to find cover by dragging himself into a nearby cupboard. 

He found a jumper which he tied around his leg to help stop the bleeding.

When the coast was clear he called for help.

Two officers managed to haul him onto a wheelchair and Mr Ludmer was taken to hospital. 

According to Ms Foss, when Mr Ludmer came out of surgery all he kept saying was that he could see the gunman's face when he closed his eyes.

Students at Mr Ludmer's school are planning to campaign against gun crime today.

Authorities have said the man accused of opening fire at the airport achieved two his goals - to kill a Transportation Security Administration officer and show how easy it is to get a gun into an airport.

The deadly rampage left investigators to piece together what motivated suspect Paul Ciancia's hatred toward the agency formed to make air travel safer after the September 11 terrorist attack.

Ciancia was shot four times by airport police, including in the mouth, and remains heavily sedated and under 24-hour armed guard at the hospital.

The FBI said he had a handwritten letter, stating that he made the conscious decision to try to kill multiple TSA officers and 'instill fear in your traitorous minds.'

Victim: Ciancia allegedly fired repeatedly at 39-year-old TSA officer Gerardo I. Hernandez, pictured, killing him

The unemployed motorcycle mechanic who recently moved to Los Angeles from the small, blue-collar town of Pennsville, New Jersey, had a friend drop him at LAX on Friday just moments before it is said he pulled a .223-caliber assault rifle from his duffel bag and opened fire, killing one TSA officer and wounding three other people, including two more TSA workers.

Officials do not believe that the friend knew of the shooter's plans.

Ciancia is believed to have arrived at the airport in a black Hyundai.

He is facing charges of murder of a federal officer and committing violence at an international airport.

The charges could qualify him for the death penalty. It was not immediately clear when he would make a first court appearance given his medical condition. 

In court documents and interviews, authorities spelled out a chilling chain of events, saying Ciancia walked into the airport's Terminal 3, pulled the assault rifle from his duffel bag and fired repeatedly at 39-year-old TSA officer Gerardo Hernandez.

It is alleged that he went up an escalator, turned back to see Hernandez move and returned to shoot him again, according to surveillance video reviewed by investigators. 

He then fired on two other uniformed TSA employees and an airline passenger, who all were wounded, as he moved methodically through the security checkpoint to the passenger gate area before airport police shot him as panicked travellers hid in stores and restaurants, it is said.

It wasn't clear why Ciancia targeted TSA officers but what was left behind indicated the gunman was willing to kill any of them that crossed his path, authorities revealed. 

It is believed Ciancia thought his constitutional rights were being violated by TSA searches and that he's a 'pissed-off patriot' upset at former Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano. 

'Black, white, yellow, brown, I don't discriminate,' the note read, according to a paraphrase by a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation. 

The letter also talked about 'how easy it is to get a gun into the airport,' the law enforcement official said.

When searched, the suspect had five 30-round magazines and his bag contained hundreds more rounds in boxes. 

U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said on CNN's State of the Union on Sunday that Ciancia's actions show how difficult it is to protect travellers at a massive airport such as LAX. 

The terminals are open and easily accessible to thousands of people who arrive at large sliding glass doors via a broad ring road that fronts the facility and is designed to move people along quickly. 

'It's like a shopping mall outside the perimeter, it's almost like an open shopping mall,' McCaul said. 

TSA Administrator John Pistole said the agency will need to work with each airport's police agency 'to see how we'll go about in providing the best possible security.'

The shooting temporarily halted traffic at the nation's third-busiest airport, stranding thousands of passengers and causing dozens of flights to be diverted to other airports. 

More than 1,500 flights and 167,000 passengers were affected nationwide, according to the Los Angeles Times. 

On Sunday, flights at the airport were back on schedule and regular operations had resumed, LAX spokesman Marshall Lowe told the newspaper. 

The FBI has served a search warrant on a Sun Valley residence where Ciancia lived, Ari Dekofsky, a spokeswoman for the FBI's Los Angeles field office, said on Sunday.

Agents are still interviewing people, she said. 

Authorities believe the rifle used in the shooting was purchased in Los Angeles. 

Ciancia also had two additional handguns that he purchased in Los Angeles, but which weren't at the crime scene, a law enforcement official said. 

The purchases themselves appeared legal, although authorities were still tracing them, and it's unclear if the shooter used his own identification or someone else's, the official said.

'He didn't buy them on the street. He didn't buy them on the Internet,' the official said. 'He bought them from a licensed gun dealer - the rifle and the two handguns.'

Hernandez, a three-year veteran of the TSA, moved to the U.S. from El Salvador at the age of 15, married on Valentine's Day in 1998 and had two children. 

The TSA said the other two officers wounded in the attack - James Speer, 54, and Tony Grigsby, 36 - have been released from the hospital. 

Two other people suffered injuries trying to evade the gunman but weren't shot.
