Google has opened its first ‘shop in shop’ on London’s Tottenham Court Road - a place renowned for its technology stores.

But unlike standard units, the Google shop will allow customers to fly over the Earth using a giant screen as well as other immersive experiences.

The shop is based inside Currys PC World on the busy London street and is designed to let people sample Google’s Android phones and tablets, Chromebook laptops and other products.

It bears some resemblance to the layout of many Apple stores, with devices displayed on benches and staff on hand to help people out.

Google’s James Elias said: ‘We’re incredibly excited to launch this space - the first of its kind anywhere in the world - in London with Currys PC World.

‘The pace of innovation of the devices we all use is incredible, yet the way we buy them has remained the same for years.

‘With the Google shop, we want to offer people a place where they can play, experiment and learn about all of what Google has to offer; from an incredible range of devices to a totally-connected, seamless online life. 

High flier: In the shop, which opens its doors today, customers will be able to use a giant immersive screen called the ‘Portal’ to ‘fly’ over different parts of the world. They can navigate using a tablet and Google Earth

Time to try: Customers can try out the latest tablets and smartwatches (pictured), of which there are various Andoid Wear iterations, including the Moto 360, LG Gwatch R

Google and Mattel have re-designed the View-Master toy, which will rely on a smartphone to deliver visual trickery.

The virtual reality device makes use of Google’s Cardboard to deliver immersive scenes such as Alcatraz prison in San Francisco, called ‘360 degree photospheres’.

The plastic body of the device has been given a sleek and less angular look than previous models, but still includes a slot for film reels.

To release the phone’s VR features, an Android phone running Mattel’s app is needed.

The phone needs to be inserted into the device along with a reel, meaning parents will have to surrender their handsets. 

The gadget uses augmented reality and animations to make  scenes feel immersive.

Mattel said its View-Master is an affordable platform enabling children to take ‘engaging field trips’ so they can explore famous landmarks, natural scenes and planets, for example, in ‘photospheres’.

By pairing an ‘experience reel’ with a smartphone, children ‘will immediately experience an imaginative and interactive learning environment,’ according to Mattel.

The device itself is set to be released in autumn in the US and next year in the UK for $30 (£20), with reels sold for $15 (£10).

‘We think it’s a genuinely unique try-before-you-buy experience.’

In the shop, which opens its doors today, customers will be able to use a giant immersive screen called the ‘Portal’ to ‘fly’ over different parts of the world.

They will be able to navigate their journey using a tablet and the Google Earth app.

Customers will also be able to show their artistic abilities on the Doodle Wall, where digital spray cans can be used to reimagine Google’s logo, or anything else.

By sitting in a Chromecast Pod, visitors will be able to watch Google Play Movies and YouTube videos broadcast via a Chromecast dongle that converts any TV into a smart set.

Customers can also try out the latest tablets and smartwatches, of which there are various Andoid Wear iterations, including the Moto 360, LG Gwatch R.  

In the future, Google will host regular classes such as how to keep secure online and learning how devices work as well as understanding how different devices work together to enable a more connected lifestyle.

‘Virtual Space Camps’ will be offered to teach children the basics of coding and teachers will be invited to ‘Open House’ events, to keep up to speed on the free educational tools.

Ainsley Sykes, Senior Project Manager for Currys PC World said: ‘This will be a new and innovative way for customers to engage in store, interacting with the immersive technology as well as having fun while learning.

An education: In the future Google will host regular classes such as how to keep secure online and learning how devices work as well as understanding how different devices work together to enable a more connected lifestyle. Here, people try out new laptops

Focus on fun: Google is bolstering its efforts to reach new groups of people, including children, by rolling out new products such as the re-imagined View-Master toy with Mattel (illustrated)

‘Google experts will be on hand to maximise the experience for users and provide help and support around the Google eco-system.’

Google is bolstering its efforts to reach new groups of people, including children, by rolling out new products such as the re-imagined View-Master toy with Mattel.

The popular retro toy works with a smartphone and dedicated app and will go on sale in the US later this year. 

Google has previously announced plans to make child-friendly versions of some of its products such as Chrome, YouTube and search, which are set to be released this year.
