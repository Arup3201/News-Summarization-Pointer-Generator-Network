Children barely old enough to walk have been questioned by police over an astonishing range of crimes – including rape, theft, assault and vandalism.

Official crime statistics reveal how suspects as young as two years old were picked up by police officers.

Police also quizzed a four-year-old accused of rape in London, a five year-old for the same crime in Surrey, a five-year-old on suspicion of incest in Cheshire and two three-year-olds for sexual offences in Durham.

The crimes apparently committed by children too young for primary school are among more than 5,000 offences by youngsters aged eight and younger.

Crimes by children aged 8 and under reached a four-year high in 2014 - some were as young as two years old

2011 - 1,467 

2012 - 1,343

2013 - 1,142

2014 - 1,713 

Total - 5,665 

Overall, the figures from 34 of the 45 forces in the United Kingdom collated under the Freedom of Information Act, show that 5,665 crimes were committed by children under eight in the last four years.

Alarmingly, crimes reached a four-year high in 2014, with 1,713 recorded. Offences included fire-raising, possession of drugs, violence and causing racially or religiously aggravated public fear.

This also comes in the wake of revelations that a total of 154 children aged 12 and under were arrested for sex crimes, including rape and sexual assault.

At present, the age of criminal responsibility in England and Wales is 10, which means there is nothing police can do.

Some campaigners want to raise the age of criminal responsibility from ten to 14 but if that proposal were implemented it would mean children such as Robert Thompson and Jon Venables – who killed toddler James Bulger when they were ten – would not have to face court.

Laurence Lee, 61, who represented 10-year-old Venables in 1993, has now suggested the age of criminal responsibility be lowered to combat the rising rate of children crime. 

He told MailOnline: 'I think there is a growing case to lower the age of criminal responsibility as children crime is increasing. 

Laurence Lee, who represented Jon Venables in 1993, wants the age of criminal responsibility lowered

'Teenagers recruit young children to commit crime for them as they know they cannot be prosecuted. 

'The other problem is the rise of social networking means young children are more aware of what is going on in the world. 

'The age rate should be lowered. As a criminal lawyer, I sit in court and see what goes on in society. Youths are much savvier than they have ever been. That is down to parental upbringing and because schools cannot deal with children as they should. It is a problem that is getting worse.' 

As the age of criminal responsibility in England and Wales is set at 10, there is nothing the police can do 

Children under 10 cannot be charged with committing a criminal offence. 

However, they can be given a Local Child Curfew or a Child Safety Order. Children under 10 who break the law regularly can sometimes be taken into care, or their parents could be held responsible. 

If a child is given a Local Child Curfew it can last for up to 90 days and it can see children banned from being in a public place between 9pm and 6am, unless accompanied by an adult. 

If a child has committed an offence or broken a Local Child Curfew, they can be placed under the supervision of a youth offending team. This is called a Child Safety Order. 

The order normally lasts for up to three months, but in some cases it can last for up to 12 months. If a child doesn't stick to the rules of an order, the court can consider if the child should be taken into care. 

The United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) has been warning since 1995 that the UK's threshold of 10 – set in 1963 – is incompatible with its obligations under the UN's convention on children's rights.

The UNCRC wants countries to set the age of criminal responsibility at an 'absolute minimum' of 12, and aim to keep increasing it. The European average is 14, ranging from 13 in France, 14 in Germany, 15 in Denmark and Sweden, 16 in Portugal and 18 in Luxembourg. 

Scotland increased the age at which children can be prosecuted from eight to 12 in 2011. 

Children between 10 and 17 in England can be arrested and taken to court if they commit a crime. They are treated differently from adults and are dealt with by youth courts, given different sentences and sent to special secure centres for young people, not adult prisons.

Of the total 5,665 recorded crimes, the vast majority were criminal damage or vandalism with 2,376, followed by shoplifting, theft and dishonesty with 1,279 and assault or acts of violence with 985. 

There were 35 rapes, of which 24 were in London. Disturbingly, more than half of the rapes took place in the last year with campaigners citing 'degrading and often violent pornography' as a factor for this concerning rise. 

Jon Brown, NSPCC lead for tacking sexual abuse, said; 'It is very worrying that thousands of children are committing crimes, and even more concerning that many of these are sexual offences including serious assaults and rape. 

'Prevention has to be the key and that means recognising warning signs early and taking swift action. 

'Sadly, for many children easy access to degrading and often violent pornography is now part of life, and we are concerned that this may be warping their view of what is normal or acceptable behaviour. 

'When very young children, such as those of primary school age or younger, are committing these crimes, we have to question the environment in which they are growing up that has led to them behaving in this way. 

'It could be that they have seen sexual activity that they are just too young to understand and are copying what they've seen.' 

Amanda Everitt, from the mothers against murder and aggression charity, said: 'It is a concern that these figures are rising. We must do more to identify children of such a young age who display violence. 

'Interventions that are effective at changing that behaviour at the earliest possible stage need to be resourced and applied. 

'Crime victims who are affected by serious crimes committed by the under 10's are often left devastated by the fact that they will not be part of the Criminal Justice System and are often left with no knowledge of how the offender is being managed following serious crimes.' 

Questioned on whether the age of criminal responsibility should be lowered, a Ministry of Justice spokesman said: 'The Government has no plans to lower the age of criminal responsibility, which in England and Wales is currently set at the age of 10, because we believe that children under that age are unable to weigh up right and wrong in the same way that older children or adults are.'
