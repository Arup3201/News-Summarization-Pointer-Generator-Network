A man, his mother and step-father have died after they were shot during a neighbourhood dispute over farming practices at a rural Victorian property.

Officers were called to the Wedderburn address, northwest of Bendigo, at 8.30pm (AEDT) on Wednesday following reports of gunshots in the area.

A body was found and a four-hour siege with a 63-year-old man ensued before police found two more bodies.

The victims were Peter Lockhart and his wife Mary, both in their 70s, and her 48-year-old son Greg Holmes, the Bendigo Advertiser reported.

Mr Lockhart's friend Geoff Maxwell, who knew him through their involvement in the Wedderburn Historical Engine and Machinery Society, told the Advertiser he was a 'good member and a good worker'.

Detective Superintendent Peter De Santo said the alleged gunman was not related to the three victims. 

'This is out of the blue and this has escalated out of a minor neighbour dispute,' Det Supt De Santo said.

'One body's been located in the paddock, one body's been located in the driveway and one body's been located at the rear entrance of the house.

'It's a tragic scene and how it's got out of hand from a minor dispute with tragic circumstances, it's just very hard to fathom how all of this has unfolded.'

The man assisting police with their enquiries over the shooting was taken to hospital this morning and left just after midday. 

His wife was at the scene at the time - and is said to be 'okay' - and assisted investigators.

Three family members have died after they were allegedly shot at Wedderburn near Bendigo

Officers were called to a rural property at 8.30pm (AEDT) on Wednesday following reports of gunshots 

Loddon Shire mayor Gavan Holt said he understood the dispute was about farming.

'My information is that some time ago, a couple of years ago, they had a minor dispute - not a major issue and not a family matter – but a small disagreement over farming practices,' Mr Holt told Daily Mail Australia.

He said the victims were very well know in the 1000-person town, with Mr Lockhart part of a five-generation farming family in the district.

The man, a retired cereals and sheep farmer, lived on the property with his wife who was also killed.

Mr Holmes, his stepson, lived on a house on an adjoining property.

Mr Holt said the Lockharts and the man in custody all have other children with families  who live in Wedderburn, he added.

Mr Holt said the community would support each other through the tragedy.

'All we can do is say we are there for you,' he said.

'There's lives wrecked here and it's our job to just be there for them in any way we can.'

When officers arrived at the scene last night they found one person dead in the paddock of the Mulga Ridge Road property before police heard more gunshots, Superintendent Graham Kent said last night.

'Given the circumstances, police decided to withdraw from the scene,' he said. 

The incident took place in a small town more than 200km north-west of Melbourne

In the meantime, a man who was believed to have had a gun, contacted police on the phone and officers quickly cordoned off the area while trying to negotiate with the suspect.

The man barricaded himself inside a home and after four hours of negotiations surrendered peacefully to police   and was arrested about midnight.

After searching a nearby property, two more bodies were located.

Police said the firearms involved in the incident were registered and had recently been inspected.

There was no history of violence, major disputes or ongoing assaults between the neighbours, he said.

'There is some history of minor disputes in the past and when I say minor, at the very bottom end of disputes between neighbours,' Det Supt De Santo said. 

The 63-year-old is in custody and is assisting police with their enquiries.

Homicide detectives are investigating the scene and a number of witnesses are being questioned.
