Whether your 'do is greasy, flat or frizzy, most women will agree that there's nothing worse than a bad hair day.

But according to the latest research, women across the UK are waking up with 
unruly hair at least three times during the week which adds up to twenty years worth of bad hair days in their lifetime.

And each bad hair day 
is resulting in females spending at least four hours and 26 minutes 
feeling moody and depressed.

Hair-raising: British women will suffer an 
average of twenty years worth of bad hair days in their lifetime, which 
makes them moody for over four hours each day

The psychological effect of a bad hair day is significant as eight out of ten British women believe their social acceptance and beauty lies in how good their hair looks.

Key findings revealed that when women want to ooze self-confidence, be seductive and take on the world, it’s not the designer outfit, the killer heels or the freshly made-up face that carries them forward: over half of British women believe their inner strength lies in their locks.

The survey also revealed that sixty seven per cent of women would mess up a job interview if they were experiencing a bad hair day and sixty three per cent would cancel an important date if their hair was not looking its best.

Nearly half (49 per cent) of the nation’s female workers reported they lose their self worth and do not perform to their normal standard in an important meeting or presentation if they are experiencing a bad hair day, a third of them have 
even gone as far as to call in sick to avoid going into work with bad 
hair.

The survey by Travelodge also found that fifty two per cent of women would cancel an outing with their friends if they did not feel good about their hair.

The study also revealed that British women tend to take their beauty cues from celebrities and a third of the UK female population currently favours big hair with bouncy curls such as the style donned by Cheryl Cole, Holly Willoughby, Kelly Brook, Kate Middleton and Kim Kardashian.

Other research findings revealed that when faced with a bad hair day, thirteen per cent of women try to get away with it by wearing a hat all day, while one in ten women over-do their make-up to compensate.

When it comes to being seen in public with bad hair, a third of British women would most hate their work colleagues to see them.

Whilst a third of women hate the idea of friends seeing them without their usual sleek and shiny mane, a quarter of ladies don’t even want their partners see them with bad hair.

Having a bad hair day has even led to one in 20 women being dumped for being so grumpy: twelve per cent of women have had huge rows with a partner simply because their barnet made them mad, while 14 per cent have been known to snap at their children.
