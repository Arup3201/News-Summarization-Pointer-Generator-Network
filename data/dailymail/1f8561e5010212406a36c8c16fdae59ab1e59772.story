Veteran broadcaster Barbara Walters has revealed that she battled rampant sexism early in her career by not getting angry and staying focused on her job.

The 83-year-old ABC News anchor and co-creator of The View has interviewed every president since Richard Nixon, but in the 1970s her male co-host - who was paid twice her salary - refused to do joint interviews with her unless he could ask the first three questions.

'I felt I had to just do my job. And I
have said this to other women: “Just do your job. Get in early. Stay 
late, and don’t complain. Fight the big fights",' she tells Bloomberg Businessweek.

Blazing a trail: Veteran broadcaster Barbara Walters has lifted the lid on how she battled sexism early in her career by keeping her head down and working hard

Ms Walters began her broadcasting career in 1962 doing women's issues for The Today Show, which she calls 'tea pouring interviews', and admits that 'it was a very different time.'  

She once even had to wear a swimsuit on air after a model failed to appear.

'Who knew from sexism?' Ms Walters told the magazine. 
'Now if somebody says "I like your sweater" you can go to human 
resources, and the person could get fired.'

She had a great relationship with Hugh Downs, but when he left in 1971 his replacement Frank McGee was much less welcoming. 

'He didn't want me to participate at all,' she reveals. 'The compromise was that after the third question, I could come in.'

Getting answers: Ms Walters says that her friendly manner when interviewing guests like Senator Hilary Clinton has helped her ask more probing questions

She adds: 'I worked very hard on that fourth question.'

But instead of 
getting angry, Mr McGee's studio rules drove Ms Walters to go out into 
the field and do her own interviews. This earned her, she says, a 
reputation as a 'pushy cookie'.

When
McGee died in 1974 - which she says no one expected - she became the network's first female co-host.

A few years later she also became the first 
female to host the ABC Evening News.

Career highlights: Ms Walter's interview with Monica Lewinsky in 1999 was viewed by 74 million people and remains her highest-rated interview of all time

Whether it's a head of state or celebrity, Ms Walters says that the secret to doing a great interview is doing your homework. 

'It used to really annoy me when someone would come to interview me and say, "I'm sorry. I've never seen you on the air",' she admits.

She also discovered that that low-key friendly approach worked to her advantage during interviews.

'If you say “What’s the biggest misconception about you?”, that's easier than saying “Tell me why you married your sister".' she explains.

'It was a very different time. Now if somebody says "I like your sweater" they could get fired'

But she says that some guests, like former president Richard Nixon, have still been painfully awkward.

'Nixon wanted you to like him. It was almost pathetic,' she says.

'He would tell off-color jokes to the camera crew. He was such an uncomfortable person that he didn't know how to do it.'

This isn't the first time that Ms Walters has expressed contrarian views on feminism.

She made headlines in 2012 for taking former 
Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum's side after blamed 'radical 
feminism' for convincing women that working was the key to happiness.

Through it all, Ms Walters says that she is proud of the fact that she has affected the way that women are regarded.

'If I have done stories and interviews that have in the past been done by men, and I opened the door a little bit, and now it’s taken for granted, that would be a legacy I could be proud of.'
