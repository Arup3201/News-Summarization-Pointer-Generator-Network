A litter of puppies will soon be delivering 'woof' justice after becoming a police force's first family of four-legged law enforcers.

Ruby, a German Shepherd, gave birth to a litter of seven - including four bitches - in June.

It is the first time puppies have been bred from a serving Devon and Cornwall Police dog.

Ash, Axel, Arry, Argo, Ava, Anya and Annie will live with puppy walkers for at least a year before they begin police dog training, the force said.

It seemed appropriate to give them all names that started with 'A' because it was Ruby's first litter.

The police pooches will be taught their craft when they are between 12 and 18 months old

After the puppies were born, on June 3, there were more than 165,000 entries offering suggestions for names, including many international ones which took officers 'a little by surprise', the force said.

As well as from the UK, suggestions came from France, Poland, the U.S., Canada and Australia.

Officers hope Ruby will produce another litter in a year's time.Â
