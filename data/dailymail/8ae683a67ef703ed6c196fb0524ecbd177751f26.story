Atletico Madrid (2011-13): 91 apps/70 goals

Monaco (2013-14): 22 apps/13 goals

The 28-year-old Colombia star will earn around £200,000-a-week after touching down at Manchester Airport in a private jet to complete the deal on transfer deadline day.

Ronaldo, speaking at a TAG Heuer event in Madrid, said: 'He is very good player. I think Manchester did very well. I don’t think he is the wrong type of player. He is a top player so I don’t think it is a wrong buy.

'I think he will be a fantastic buy. Manchester have not started well, two points, so they need quality players and Falcao is a quality player.'

The potent striker had been expected to join Manchester City, while Arsenal also entered the race late last week.

But United threw their hat into the ring amid fears of persistent niggling injuries to Robin van Persie and will offset Falcao's arrival by allowing Danny Welbeck to leave, while Javier Hernandez has joined Real Madrid.

Making strides: The 28-year-old is expected to make his debut against Queens Park Rangers in a fortnight 

Indeed, Madrid were frontrunners for Falcao and the player himself posted - and later deleted - a tweet on Saturday appearing to confirm the move.

But the Spanish giants, who sold Di Maria to United for £60m last week, instead opted to sign Hernandez who had struggled to force his way into Van Gaal's plans. The Mexican joins on loan with a view to a permanent deal next summer.

After completing his move, Falcao will join up with his national team ahead of their friendly against Brazil in Miami on Friday night.

His first game for United is likely to be at home to Queens Park Rangers on September 14. 

On the run: Ronaldo spent six seasons at Manchester United before joining Real Madrid in 2009
