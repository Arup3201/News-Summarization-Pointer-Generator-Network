A rusty old Jaguar convertible which does not run has sold at auction for more than £77,000 - nearly five times its estimate - and the new owner will now have to spend another £120,000 to get it on the road.

Incredibly, the dilapidated E-Type Roadster sold for £77,760 - the same price as a brand new, top-of-the-range F-Type convertible - its spiritual successor. 

This is because it is one of the extremely rare 'Flat Floor' models, of which there are thought to be just 170 left in existence.

What a state: The inside of the car, which had been hidden away off the road for the last 20 years

In need of some TLC: The beautiful Jaguar will need around £120,000 spent on it to get up and running again

The car has been off the road and hidden away for the last 20 years.

When it was finally reintroduced to the world at Bonhams’ Beaulieu auction at the weekend, there was no shortage of interest.

The unnamed buyer was forced to pay way over the £15-20,000 estimate, but even after he restores it there is a chance he could still make a profit on the car.

In 2011, a Flat Floor model E-Type in excellent condition was sold for £25,000 less than this one - showing how demand is increasing rapidly.

Wheely good: Even after he has paid to renovate it, the buyer could still make a profit on the rare vehicle

Nick Goldthorp, from Jaguar specialist Classic Motor Cars in Shropshire, said: 'The early cars are the collectible ones and prices are still going up.

'I was not really surprised when it sold for £77,000 and, when restored, it will probably be worth in excess of £200,000.'

When it is back on the road, the E-Type’s 3.8-litre engine will develop around 265 brake horse power.

This will give the convertible sports car a 0-60mph time of seven seconds and a top speed in excess of 150mph.

Restoration: The E-Type will hit top speeds of more than 150mph once it has been restored to its former glory

Last month, the E-Type was voted the greatest car of all time, beating Aston Martins, Rolls Royces and the VW Beetle to the crown.

The iconic car, launched in 1961, was given the award by new Discovery Channel show Wheeler Dealers , picking up 32 per cent of the vote.

The Mini came in second with 20 per cent, just ahead of the Porsche 911, with 18 per cent. 

Eight British cars made the top 10, with Mike Brewer, the show's car trading expert, saying: 'This underlines the incredible heritage of British car manufacturing, where originality, style and performance have been the hallmarks of many of our greatest cars.'

The Jaguar E-Type, also known as the XK-E, was produced between 1961 and 1975, and is cherished by Brits as one of the greatest, if not the greatest car the country ever made.

It was designed by Malcolm Sayer, a Norfolk man born in 1916 who spent almost 20 years working for Jaguar, and also designed the XJ-S. He worked at Bristol Aeroplane Company during World War II, before heading to Iraq to work at Baghdad University - an institution, it turned out, which did not exist.

He joined Jaguar in 1951, and was one of the first car designers to use aerodynamics. He sadly died from a heart attack in 1970 - five years before the E-Type went out of production.

The car came into being as a result of Jaguar's incredible racing success throughout the 1950s. The company's racing department was tasked with using the Triple Le Mans 24-Hours winning D-type’s construction approaches to build a road-going sports car to replace the XK150. 

The E-Type, made in Coventry, was initially a two-seater, rear wheel drive coupe, though a four seater version was released later. The original cars cost around £2,100 - significantly less than what was being put on the market by competitors like Ferrari and Aston Martin.

The Series 1 hit the British market in July 1961, and continued to be produced for seven years. It had a 3.8-litre engine, which was upped to 4.2 litres in 1964, a top speed of around 150mph and could reach 0-60mph in around seven seconds.

The main change for the 1968-71 Series 2 was the front lights - which were no longer protected by glass, and a redesigned interior, before the Series 3 was introduced with a new 12 cylinder, 5.3-litre engine.

The Series 3 was notable for its slatted front grill and flared wheel arches, and also had power steering. Of the three models, it is the Series 1 which is most iconic and also most desirable today.

Essentially, it was speed restrictions in the 1970s which spelt the E-Type's end - it could not meet new U.S. safety regulations, and the XJ-S was built in its place.

In motorsport, Australian driver Bob Jane won the 1963 Australian GT Championship in a lightweight E-Type, and the car also performed well in SCCA Production sports car racing. A Series 3 won the B-Production championship in 1975.
