Much like England’s centre halves here in Brazil, Greg Dyke is becoming the FA chairman who commits too early.

He repeatedly makes decisions before thinking them through. He makes embarrassing statements that have FA spin doctors frantically sweeping up the mess.

The throat-cutting gesture at the World Cup draw, for instance, the declaration that ‘the French will commit suicide’ should they fail to progress from their group, not to mention the view Dyke expressed on Friday that two World Cup defeats would be good preparation for Euro 2016.

Unnecessary: Greg Dyke has made a series of needless comments in his role as FA chairman

Crass: Dyke reacted to England's World Cup draw with a poor taste cut-throat gesture

Hasty: England crashed at the group stage in Brazil but Dyke says Roy Hodgson will not be sacked

Really? How so? Never mind the poor souls who have paid thousands to be in Belo Horizonte on Tuesday for what they rather hoped would be a big game.

Dyke says daft things. He suggested ITV, major rights holders for England games, had not done a terribly good job of screening the FA Cup. And when he complained about a lack of opportunities for young English players, in almost the same breath he said the FA should explore the possibility of Adnan Januzaj playing for England.

Some say they like his dynamic style. Hell, he deserved admiration for telling FIFA president Sepp Blatter he was out of order earlier this month.

But when Dyke became FA chairman last year he seemed to have a dig at his predecessor for falling out with Blatter, even though the stance David Bernstein took after the original World Cup voting debacle is looking increasingly justified.

Dyke simply shoots from the hip, often when it isn’t necessary.

He backed Roy Hodgson to remain England manager beyond this World Cup long before the tournament even started.

And he has backed him again when one more game remains against Costa Rica.

There was no need to say anything yet — certainly when Hodgson was not even Dyke’s appointment — but rather than wait and see, Dyke committed early. Evidence would suggest he will be in no hurry to admit he’s got it wrong.
