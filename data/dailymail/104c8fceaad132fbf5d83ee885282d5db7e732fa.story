In the history of human invention, there's nothing that matches the car. We rely on them every day. To do our jobs, drop the kids off at school, or take an elderly relative shopping. Cars mean freedom and independence, and most importantly of all, convenience.

But years of crazy parking rules have made many law-abiding shoppers and drivers feel like criminals, and caused enormous damage to local shops and businesses. We all know the story.

You return a minute late to find a parking ticket slapped on your windscreen. Or maybe you run a local shop, and customers have dried up because what you sell costs less than the parking fee.

Local Government and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles (left) and Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin (right) have vowed to end the 'war on the motorist' with their new 'common sense' approach

In 2010 we said this war on the motorist must end. That meant not only changing the rules, but changing attitudes, because under the previous Government councils were encouraged to fleece shoppers and rivers for every penny, treating them like cash machines on wheels.

This included spying on and filming drivers going about their daily lives. Where if you made a mistake it would mean an expensive bill in the post. If you protested it could mean a doubling of the original fine, or an angry bailiff knocking on your door. And all these parking rules were changed without proper debate by Parliament. Residents and businesses just had to suffer in silence.

The minister says they want to see 'fairness and balance' restored to the system so parking no longer generates profit

These rules have now been changed during this parliament. Local residents and businesses will be able to demand a review of parking in their area, including charges and the use of yellow lines. Parking adjudicators will be able to hold councils to account so they can look to change signs and stop charging fines in areas where parking tickets keep being issued.

They have also vowed to end the industrial use of CCTV 'spy cars' to enforce on-street parking 

We are bringing back common sense. Very soon shoppers and drivers will also benefit from 10 minute 'grace periods' for council-controlled parking, whether it's on or off-street, paid or free. It means you won't get fined for being a few minutes late.

We're also ending the industrial use of CCTV 'spy cars' to enforce on-street parking. The new rules will end the plague of parking tickets in the post, but ensure public safety as CCTV will still be used to protect schools, bus lanes and red routes.

Why have we done this? Because we want see fairness and balance restored to the system. As a result it will no longer possible to use parking to generate profit and we're cracking down on the use of aggressive bailiffs.

And in another victory for common sense parking at an out-of-order meter will not result in a fine if there is no other way to pay. There are also occasions where shoppers and drivers receive a fine and appeal because they genuinely believe they've done nothing wrong. We'll be trialling a new system so if this happens to you, you'll receive a 25% discount even if the appeal is lost.

These changes are great news for drivers but they are good news for town centres and business too. People supporting their local high street will be able to enjoy shopping without constantly worrying about trigger happy parking wardens waiting to pounce.

Under the previous administration life became unbearable for those behind the wheel as town halls failed to recognise the countless benefits that cars bring. We're ending this pointless war on motorists so that you don't feel like a criminal just for parking your car.
