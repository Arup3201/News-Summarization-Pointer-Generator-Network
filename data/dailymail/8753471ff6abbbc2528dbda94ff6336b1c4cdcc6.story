Police say a 10-year-old girl was asleep in her family's Pennsylvania apartment when she was woken up by the sound of gunshots in the middle of the night, in what may have been an attempted home invasion.

Washington County Coroner Tim Warco says Taniyah Thomas was shot in the head at about 3:50 a.m. Monday at her home about 20 miles southwest of Pittsburgh.

Washington police Det. Daniel Stanek says the girl, her mother, her mother's boyfriend and a baby were asleep when the shots were fired through the apartment door. Taniyah died of a head wound about 30 minutes later at Washington Hospital.

Killed: Taniyah Thomas, 10-year-old girl fatally shot at Pennsylvania home

Killed: 10-year-old girl who was woken up by sound of gunfire shot to death during attempted home invasion as she ran for safety to her mom's bedroom

Police say the shooter didn't enter the apartment. They also say it isn't clear whether more than one suspect was involved.

Police haven't said who they believe may have been targeted in the potential home invasion.

During a morning news conference, police said whoever fired the shots kicked in a bottom level door to get access to the building. They then traveled upstairs, where the shots were fired.

Thomas’ grandfather, Sherman Brown, told CBS News that he blames the mother’s boyfriend and thinks this was drug-related.

'Why would they come to somebody’s house and break in and then go to shooting? She was an innocent girl and got shot and died. And that’s terrible. I’m just so upset,' Sherman Brown said.

Investigators said Taniyah likely woke up scared after hearing the gunshots and tried running to her mom’s room, where she was shot.

Taniyah’s grandfather said she loved cheerleading and was an innocent bystander to terrible violence.

'You don’t shoot kids. I can see you killing a grown-up or doing something that did something to you. You don’t mess with young kids. Why? They never did anything you,' Sherman Brown told WPXI.

'I just took her last Wednesday to her cheerleading and she was supposed to go tomorrow to Pittsburgh for a competition. Now she can’t go.'

Police have also said an infant was also inside the home at the time of the shooting, but was not hurt.

A fund has been set up for anyone that would like to contribute cash donations for the funeral of the little girl at GiveForward.com.
