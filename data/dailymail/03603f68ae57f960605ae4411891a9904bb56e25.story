Anti-terror police have arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of being a member of or supporting ISIS in east London. 

Counter Terrorism officers visited an address in Newham this morning where the man, who has not been named, was detained.

He is suspected of collecting information used to commit terrorism offences, belonging to or supporting the Islamic extremist organisation and encouraging terrorism. 

A 32-year-old man has been arrested in east London on suspicion of supporting ISIS, the terror organisation waging jihad in the Middle East. Above, a member in the group's Syrian stronghold Raqqa 

He will be held at a south London police station while investigators continue their inquiries. 

ISIS, the fanatical organisation wreaking terror across Syria and parts of Iraq, was proscribed by the Government in June last year. 

It came after hundreds were slaughtered by militants in the Middle East. Several western and Asian journalists reporting on the conflict have since been executed on camera, while the group brutally burned alive a Jordanian pilot in their most recent slaying. 

Earlier this week police in Merseyside and the West Midlands made three arrests in relation to terrorism offences. 

The suspects were held over social media postings. They are unrelated to the today's arrest.

Meanwhile in October last year, CT officers carried out a number of raids across London in which 11 people were arrested on suspicion of offences relating to terrorism.

The raids were part of an extensive police operation. 

Metropolitan Police would not confirm whether today's arrest was related to any of those made previously by CT investigators.
