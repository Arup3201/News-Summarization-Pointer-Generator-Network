Whales may be known for having large appetites, but one humpback nearly bit off more than it could chew off the coast of California after almost swallowing a pelican.

The bizarre scene was captured by photographer Kate Cummings in Monterey Bay as she watched a gathering of birds, sea lions and whales feasting on a school of anchovies.

While the pelican appeared to be doomed after becoming trapped in the whale's mouth, the creature opened its jaws again just before diving, allowing the bird to flap its way to freedom.

One humpback whale almost bit off more than it could chew while hunting for anchovies in California after accidentally snaring a pelican between its huge jaws

Anchovies, like sardine or herring, swim in huge schools which move as one body, and are covered in silvery scales to help confuse predators as they dart about to avoid being eaten.

When attacked from all sides by predatory fish or sea lions, the instinct to stick together becomes a weakness, trapping the fish in so-called 'bait balls' which are also targeted by birds as they rise towards the surface.

Whales make their hunt easier by waiting for these densely-packed balls to form, before rising up from underneath to swallow them whole with one huge gulp.

However, as so many other animals crowd around trying to get a piece of the action, it is not uncommon for them to also become fish food. 

Ms Cummings, who took the pictures for Blue Ocean Whale Watch, said: 'This particular pelican's timing was a bit off and didn't lift off fast enough before the humpback whales emerged.

Ms Cummings said that whales have a large pink organ on the top of their mouths, which can be mistake for a tongue, which is used to sense how much food has gone into their mouths - and probably alerted the whale to the fact that the bird was stuck

Whales often wait for schools of anchovies to be herded into 'bait balls' by other predators before striking from below, swallowing the densley-packed fish in one go. Because these balls attract many other animals, it is not uncommon for them to be caught in the beast's jaws

'The humpback didn't close its mouth all the way. It's very likely the whale felt the pelican in its mouth and didn't want to crush it.

'We watched as the whale opened its mouth wide before submerging again and the pelican hopped across the water with no visible damage.

She added: 'Humpback whales have a special organ on the roof of their mouth - a long, pink strip that's often confused for the whale's tongue.

'It's very sensitive and is likely used to get a feel for how much food the whale is taking in with one mouthful, though they could also use it to detect something inside their mouth that didn't belong there - like a pelican.'
