A Chinese man has been jailed for 11 years for cutting off his nine-year-old stepson's hand with a meat cleaver and boiling it so it would be impossible for surgeons to reattach.

Wang Xinyu, 31, met the boy's mother Xiao Shen just over a year ago and the pair had been looking at buying a flat together in Shenyang - a city in east China's Liaoning province.

But after the couple had a furious telephone argument about money, Wang lost his temper and began beating Xiao Jun with a stick before cutting off his hand with a meat cleaver and throwing it into a pot of boiling water that was being used to cook their evening meal.

Guilty: Wang Xinyu, 31, (centre) beat Xiao Jun with a stick before cutting off his hand with a meat cleaver and throwing it into a pot of boiling water that was being used to cook their evening meal

In the days leading up to the attack, Wang and Jun moved to Shenyang to stay in a rented apartment, while the boy's mother went to stay with relatives in the hope of borrowing the rest of the money the couple needed to purchase an apartment.

But there was a furious row when she rang her lover to tell him that the process was taking longer than she thought and after he hung up the phone he grabbed a stick and started to beat Jun.

Wang then grabbed a meat cleaver from the kitchen and chopped off the boy's hand before throwing it into a pot of water that had been heating to cook their evening meal.

Another resident in the rented apartment block said: 'I heard the boy saying 'Dad, please don't, dad, please don't. Even though I then heard the boy screaming I really didn't expect it would have been so terrible.'

Sad: After having his hand cut off by his stepfather, nine-year-old Xiao Jun told police: 'I always thought he would really be a good dad to me, I liked him. Now everything is ruined. I don't know why he did this'

Wounded: In the days leading up to the attack, Wang and Jun (pictured) moved into a rented apartment. The boy's mother then went to stay with relatives in the hope of borrowing money

The stepfather then called police to confess what he had done and took the boy and the cooked hand to hospital, where doctors said that it had already swelled up and was no longer usable.

It means Jun will not be able to have his hand reattached and he will now need an artificial arm.

Wang lost his job as a crane driver as the a result of the crime - meaning that the now disabled boy and his mother no longer have his income. 

Xiao Shen, who forgave Wang for the attack on her son, has since given birth to his twins.

Future: Wang (pictured with his head covered) lost his job as a crane driver as the a result of the crime - meaning that the now disabled boy and his mother no longer have an income

Treatment: At the Shenyang Intermediate People's Court, Wang apologised and admitted cutting of the right hand of Jun (pictured).  His lawyer argued Wang acted 'out of impulse' and asked for a lenient sentence

Injured: A relative of Xiao Jun is seen crying in his hospital ward. After having his hand cut off, Jun's stepfather boiled it in water so that it could not be reattached. Jun will now need a prosthetic limb for the rest of his life

The boy told police: 'I always thought he would really be a good dad to me, I liked him. Now everything is ruined. I don't know why he did this, he just seemed to become someone else.'

Wang apologised and admitted to committing the crime at the Shenyang Intermediate People's Court.

His lawyer argued Wang acted 'out of impulse' and asked for a lenient sentence.

In handing him only 11 years in prison instead of life, the court  agreed to this request after hearing that he had showed contrition and been forgiven by the boy's family.
