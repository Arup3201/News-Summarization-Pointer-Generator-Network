to treat Ms Brennan, firefighters used airbags and blocks to raise the
vehicle from on top of her.

Booker Wholesale, in Avonsmouth, said: 'Following a tragic accident at 
our Avonmouth branch we are currently working closely with the police 
and all relevant authorities to ensure a full investigation. Our 
thoughts are with the family.'

Ms Brennan’s team mates Helen 
Buckley and Rachel Amphlett said: 'Annie was one of the original Bristol
rugby girls. She was much loved by all who played alongside her at St 
Mary’s, Avonmouth and Clifton.

'She was the backbone of every club she played at. Annie was dedicated, loyal, tenacious and a true friend to us all.

'Annie had a wonderfully dry sense of
humour and was a great friend to be around. She would take part in 
everything and everyone respected her.'

Her friend Jo Sully added: 'She led 
by example and was an absolute credit to any team she played for. I am 
going to miss her so much.'

Former St Mary’s captain Sammy Knighton added: 'She was absolutely lovely. The girls are very upset.'

inspiration to the other girls.'
