Furry little critters may not be loved by everyone but the tiny rats in these photographs prove they can indeed be loveable.

Russian photographer Anna Tyurin, 24, has spent the last two years taking pictures of the rodents, claiming that they are easy subjects to work with.

'They quickly realized what I wanted them to do,' she says.

Usually seen as vermin, it is hard to deny this little guy is cute poking out from behind a snowman 

Not a typical subject for photographs, Anna has spent the last two years taking pictures of the rodents

'In that way, it turned out easy to work with them. Rats are smart animals.'

Animal lover Anna claims she was inspired to create a funny photo album by her own two female rats Chesha and Nyusha.

She said: 'Some ideas appeared in my mind while watching the rats, investigating their intercommunication.

Although we think of them as aggressive animals, Anna claims they are fairly easy to work with 

Anna says her photos have changed peoples opinions on rats, even temporarily curing phobias 

'Usually, I try to find the source of inspiration everywhere, from nature, strolls in the woods, films and books.'

Despite rats being unpopular with many because of their association with being dirty vermin who plague towns and cities, they are often kept as pets and are well-liked by some.

Anna said: 'In the main, people have had a positive response. They have melted at lovely whiskered snouts disbelieving that these are really rats.

'Even people deeply affected by rat phobia have forgotten about a rat's scary tail for a while.

This inquisitive little fellow looks ready to play 

'Some of my friends have come to a decision to buy a rat as a pet. I'm happy that my photos changes the way people treat these animals.'

The young photographer has been taking photographs of domestic animals, like dogs, cats and horses, for four years.

When she is not taking pictures of animals Anna likes to travel to cities in Russia, Ukraine and Byelorussia 'in search of exciting places or subjects' snapping them with Nikon cameras and special lenses.

Anna added: 'I've got an assistant to help, the assistant look after rats and doesn't allow them to run away or run into danger.'
