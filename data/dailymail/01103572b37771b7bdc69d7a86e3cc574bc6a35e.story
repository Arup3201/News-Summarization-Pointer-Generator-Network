Southampton stopped Chelsea from going eight points clear at the top of the Premier League after Dusan Tadic cancelled out Diego Costa's opener at Stamford Bridge.

Costa opened the scoring on 11 minutes when he headed past Fraser Forster, but when Nemanja Matic brought down Sadio Mane shortly after, the Saints were gifted a way back into the game.

Tadic didn't need asking twice as he slotted the ball past Thibaut Courtois, and the scores remained at 1-1.

Find out how each player fared at Stamford Bridge with Sportsmail's Neil Ashton. 

CHELSEA (4-2-3-1)

Thibaut Courtois - Excellent save from Mane in 13th minute, low to his right. Saved brilliantly from Mane again 30 minutes in. 8

Thibaut Courtois made an excellent save from Sadio Mane early on, and was solid throughout the game

Branislav Ivanovic - Provided the quality cross for Costa to head home. Unlucky not to have won penalty. 6

Gary Cahill - All over the shop. What happened to the Gary Cahill from the Capital One Cup final? Still at Wembley celebrating. 5.5

John Terry - Chaotic in defence, along with the rest of Chelsea’s back four. 5.5

John Terry (pictured), alongside his centre-back partner Gary Cahill, were chaotic throughout in defence

Cesar Azpilicueta - Looks like a man in need of a breather. That may well come at Hull on Sunday. 5.5

Nemanja Matic - Gave away penalty for Saints to equalise, no complaints. Booked. Should have been sent off for foul on Mane in 46th minute. 5

Cesc Fabregas - Looks tired and lacking ideas or inspiration. 5

Willian - Got going at the start of the second half with some nice touches around the box. 6

Cesc Fabregas looked like he needs a rest; he was lacking any ideas or inspiration during the game

Oscar - Quiet and subdued, what has happened to him? Substituted. 5

Eden Hazard - Sweet touches, just needed the end product. Always a joy to watch. Deserved a goal for this performance. 8

Diego Costa - Started and finished the move for Chelsea’s opener. Welcome back, Diego. 7

Eden Hazard is always a joy to watch and this was no different - he deserved a goal to top off his performance

SUBSTITUTES

Ramires (Matic 53): Had to happen, before Matic was sent off. 6

Loic Remy (Oscar 82): Inevitable substitution. 6

Juan Cuadrado (Willian 83): Desperate last throw of the dice by Mourinho to find a winner. 6

Jose Mourinho's side were knocked out of the Champions League this week, and could not beat Southampton

Subs not used: Petr Cech, Filipe Luis, Kurt Zouma, Didier Drogba

Booked: Matic, Ivanovic, Cahill 

MANAGER - Jose Mourinho: Expected a reaction from his team after Champions League elimination. Didn’t get one. 6

SOUTHAMPTON (4-2-3-1)

Fraser Forster - No chance with Chelsea’s opener, safe as houses after that. 7

Nathaniel Clyne - Steady at the back, one of the most accomplished right backs in the Premier League now. 7

Toby Alderweireld - One of the finds of the season. Saints cannot let him go. 7.5

Toby Alderweireld (left) has been one of the finds of the season, and Southampton cannot let him leave

Jose Fonte - Another commanding performance. All got very lively at the end, came through it unscathed. 7

Ryan Bertrand - Some juicy crosses from the left against his old side, especially in the first half. 7

Victor Wanyama - Tough guy in the centre, loved his battle with Matic. Eventually booked. 6.5

Morgan Schneiderlin - Big chance to score flew wide, looked desperate to hit the winner. 7

Southampton players Morgan Schneiderlin, Victor Wanyama and Jose Fonte celebrate at the final whistle

Steven Davis - The accessory in midfield but still played his part in an excellent team performance. 7

Dusan Tadic - Sweet cut back for Mane, went on to score penalty after 19 minutes. Courtois saved chances brilliantly in 13th and 30th minute. 7

Shane Long - Tireless performance, good call to leave Pelle out of the starting line up. 7

Sadio Mane - Won the penalty. Terrorised Chelsea’s defence with his quick footwork. All three Chelsea bookings came from fouls on him. Game of his life. 8.5

SUBSTITUTES

Filip Djuricic (Tadic 71): Little threat down the left. 6

James Ward-Prowse (David 71): Stuck to defensive duties. 6

Graziano Pelle (Long 83): Thrown on

Sadio Mane (right) had the game of his life for Southampton, terrorising Chelsea's defence throughout

Subs not used: Kelvin Davis, Maya Yoshida, Florian Gardos, Pelle, Targett.

Booked: Mane, Wanyama Djuricic.

MANAGER - Ronald Koeman: Brilliant response from team when the went 1-0 down. Composed, inventive, bristling performance. 7.5

Ronald Koeman's team responded brilliantly after going a goal down, and were level just eight minutes later

REFEREE: Mike Dean. Pretty much spot on with most decisions. Difficult for him to spot Ivanovic being tripped. 8

Attendance: 41,614

Man of the match: SAIDO MANE
