When it came to booking an affordable getaway this summer, the Spanish sun was beckoning for many Britons.

Majorca and Ibiza were revealed as the most popular destinations last season, up 68 per cent and 46 per cent from last year, respectively, according to a survey by UK travel organisation Abta.

Celebrity party hotspot, Ibiza attracts high-profile guests (and performers) to its white sand beaches, including girl-group The Saturdays and Made in Chelsea's Cheska Hull.

Ibiza was named one of the most popular summer holiday destination for Britons, says survey from Abta

Bookings to Ibiza were up 46% from last year, while trips to Majorca were up a staggering 68%

Celebrities such as Paris Hilton and Made in Chelsea's Cheska Hull are big fans of the Spanish islands

Located in the Mediterranean Sea, Majorca is the largest island in Spain's Balearic Islands archipelago

Heiress Paris Hilton is also a fan of the Balearic Islands, particularly of Ibiza's Ushuaia Beach Hotel.

Italy was also a popular pick, thanks to 'great-value hotel deals'.

Florence in particular benefited from visits from celebrity guests last season, including Kim Kardashian and Kanye West who were married in the Tuscan city in May. 

Turkey, Greece, Malta, and Morocco were also top choices for holidaymakers, while bookings to Brazil were down given the high prices sparked by the World Cup.

Kim Kardashian and Kanye West also love Italy - the pair wed in Florence in May of this year

Roman holiday! Due to an unstable political climate in Egypt, travellers opted for destinations closer to home

Trips to Egypt also fell because of the political climate, according to a survey by travel company lowcostholidays.

When it came to long-haul trips, favourites included Orlando, Florida, Mexico, Dubai, and the Caribbean, with all of these destinations showing increases of more than 100 per cent from summer 2013.

Tim Buckman at lowcostholidays said: 'We had a great summer and bookings for October half-term and winter-sun holidays are looking strong with the Canaries, Egypt, Orlando, and Dubai currently booking well.'

'Next summer, we predict that Greece and Turkey will benefit from further growth and Crete and Tunisia will be popular destinations due to new flights from across the UK making them more accessible.'
