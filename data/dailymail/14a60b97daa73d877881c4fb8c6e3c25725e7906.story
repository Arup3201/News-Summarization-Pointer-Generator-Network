American traders braced for an economic backlash after the federal government shut down at midnight on Monday evening and the price of oil took the first major hit.

Benchmark oil for November delivery dropped 35 cents to $101.99 per barrel at midday Bangkok time in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract fell 54 cents to close at $102.33 on Monday after trading as low as $101.05.

The looming threat of a shutdown- the first of it's kind in 17 years- sank stocks in anticipation on Monday as Wall Street worried that a budget fight in Washington could lead to an event far worse for the economy— a failure to raise the nation's borrowing limit.

The two financial debates- first the failure to pass a budget and the still-looming threat over the possible refusal to raise the debt ceiling which is scheduled to occur on October 17- are adding pressure to one another and causing economic unease globally.

Closed for business: The government shutdown means that nearly a million government workers will be sent home without pay and the nation's struggling economy will take a hit

Early global implications seemed 
positive as international markets held steady, though the real test will
come when American markets open on Tuesday morning.

'When you're in a time of lower funding and money, you tend to cut things like travel,' said Evan Lucas, market analyst at IG in Melbourne, Australia.

After climbing to over $110 in late August, the price of oil has fallen as diplomacy aimed at Syria and Iran eased concerns about Middle East supplies.

'Considering there was a big run-up in oil prices two weeks ago, it's just a bit of a correction,' Lucas said.

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 129 points, or 0.8 per cent, to close at 15,129.67. The Standard & Poor's 500 slid 10 points, or 0.6 per cent, to 1,681.55 and the Nasdaq composite dropped 10 points, or 0.3 per cent, to 3,771.48.

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 129 points, or 0.8 percent, to close at 15,129.67. The Standard & Poor's 500 slid 10 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,681.55 and the Nasdaq composite dropped 10 points, or 0.3 percent, to 3,771.48

There is a simple reason why the 
budget battle — and, more importantly, an upcoming fight over the debt 
ceiling — are so crucial: the credit of the United States is the bedrock
that nearly every other investment is built upon, largely due to the 
assumption that the nation will always pay its debts.

'The
concern is government has become so polarized that if it cannot pass (a
budget), there's a greater chance that the debt ceiling battle will go 
to the brink or possibly lead to a default,' said Alec Young, global 
equity strategist with S&P Capital IQ.

Monday's decline adds to what has been eventful September for investors. Stocks hit an all-time on Sept. 18 after the Federal Reserve voted to keep up its economic stimulus program. But that enthusiasm vanished as Wall Street began to worry that the political bickering between Democrats and Republicans would lead to a government shutdown and crisis over the debt ceiling.

A partial government shutdown is all but certain. Congress and the White House were no closer to a budget deal Monday afternoon.

If no deal is reached by midnight Tuesday, the federal government will partially shut down for the first time in 17 years.

A
brief shutdown wouldn't hit the economy and stock market that hard. But
a shutdown lasting two weeks could slice 0.3 percent points off U.S. 
gross domestic product, according to a report by Macroeconomic Advisers.
That is because hundreds of thousands of federal workers will go 
without a paycheck.

'You're putting a lot of people, at least 
temporarily, out of work and out of pay, and that will affect spending,'
said Kathy Jones, vice president of fixed income strategy at Charles 
Schwab. 'It slows down activity on companies that depend on federal 
contracts.'

Some investors think a shutdown may be a positive 
event in the long-term. The political pressure from a shutdown could 
force politicians to get down to business and negotiate — particularly 
on the issue of the debt ceiling.

'This may be good thing in the 
long run because it may lead to compromise,' said J.J. Kinahan, chief 
strategist at TD Ameritrade.

Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said 
last week that the government would run out of borrowing authority by 
roughly Oct. 17. The last time the debt ceiling issue came up in August 
2011, it led to Standard & Poor's downgrading the United States' 
credit rating and the Dow went through nearly three weeks of nauseating 
triple-digits moves almost daily.

Markets worldwide are reacting to the likely shutdown of the United States' federal government

'This sort of political 
brinkmanship is the dominant reason (the United States' credit) rating 
is no longer 'AAA,'' Standard & Poor's analysts Marie Cavanaugh and 
John Chambers wrote in a note to investors Monday.

If domestic 
and foreign investors begin to question whether the U.S. will pay its 
debts, it could throw every other investment out of alignment.

'It's
a threat to the center of the global financial system,' said Jake 
Lowery, portfolio manager at ING U.S. Investment Management.

Correction: Political infighting in 2011 prompted the loss of the United States' triple-A credit rating and was the primary driver of the stock market's last full-on correction

Analysts had viewed a shutdown as unlikely, with many citing other government stalemates that were resolved in the past few years. However, political infighting in 2011 prompted the loss of the United States' triple-A credit rating and was the primary driver of the stock market's last full-on correction.

Essentially all market sectors could 
see a reaction to a shutdown, with industries tied to the pace of 
economic growth- like energy and financials- seeing outsized impacts.

The
defensive sector 'will feel an immediate impact since its biggest 
customer is the U.S. government,' said Sarhan. 'We're talking billions 
of dollars in income. If that goes away, what could replace that?'

Even utilities, which are considered a defensive group, may see steep moves if a shutdown impacts interest rates.

Default fears: Even if a last-minute deal is reached, investors face a second Washington cliffhanger as Congress must agree to increase the $16.7 trillion limit on federal borrowing by October 17. If Capitol Hill fails to act in time, the unthinkable could happen and the United States could default on its debts

Among other asset classes, the uncertainty could been a boon for U.S. Treasuries as investors seek shelter. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes rose 10/32 on Friday, with yields easing to 2.62 percent.

Analysts at Brown Brothers Harriman said the U.S. dollar was likely to weaken, and that it looked vulnerable against the yen.

Even if a last-minute deal is reached, investors face a second Washington cliffhanger as Congress must agree to increase the $16.7 trillion limit on federal borrowing by October 17. If Capitol Hill fails to act in time, the unthinkable could happen and the United States could default on its debts.

'We're in a game of chicken. Once it became clear that people were willing to risk Federal employee jobs, that's when it became a real concern,' said Len Blum, managing partner of Westwood Capital LLC in New York.

'We've become somewhat desensitized to this kind of apocalyptical thing coming out of D.C., but as time goes on with no resolution, it will get increasingly bad.'
