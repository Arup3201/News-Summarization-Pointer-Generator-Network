Ministers have been accused of ‘losing their grip, on NHS finances after spending on temporary and agency staff soared to £2.6billion a year.

Hospitals are hiring agency nurses for as much as £160 an hour as they struggle to cope, particularly in A&E departments.

In Kent, one hospital paid 21 locum doctors £1,000 each for a single shift in A&E last year.

Figures obtained by Labour show NHS trusts spent £1.2billion on agency and contract staff in 2013-14.

Foundation trusts, which have a degree of independence, spent nearly £1.4billion – more than twice the budget.

In many cases, the NHS pays commission to agencies providing staff.

Liz Kendall, shadow health minister has called hiring agency staff a 'false economy' for the NHS

Typically, agency workers are up to 30 per cent more expensive than equivalent permanent staff, but critics point to evidence that they sometimes cost more than double.

Shadow health minister Liz Kendall told the Daily Mail: ‘Labour warned about the dangers of cutting nurses’ jobs and training. Now hospitals are spending billions of pounds extra on temporary and agency staff. It’s a false economy.

Patient care is going backwards under this Government, and ministers are losing grip of the NHS’s finances.’

Foundation trusts planned to spend £523million on agency staff in 2013-14, but ended up spending £1.4billion.

Costs on non-agency staff were virtually as budgeted.

More than one in three NHS trusts in England have plunged into the red. Labour is also warning of a potential crisis in A&Es, with performance deteriorating.

Ministers hit back by pointing out that Labour regularly oversaw deficits in the NHS.

A Conservative health spokesman said: ‘The NHS has responded emphatically. In some cases, temporary staff have been used to address problems that persisted under the last Government.

'There are now 13,000 more permanent staff than in 2010.’
