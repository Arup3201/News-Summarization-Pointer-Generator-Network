Music producer Scott Storch was robbed at gunpoint of over $100,000 worth of jewelry plus $5,000 in cash in New York's Times Square yesterday.

The hip-hop hitmaker, 39, and a 32-year-old companion had just stepped out of a SUV on West 46th St. near Eighth Ave after leaving the New York Palace Hotel on Madison Ave when they were approached by two men.

The robbers pulled out a gun before reportedly ordering: 'Give us all your jewelry and cash or you're dead'.

Storch, who has produced records for 
stars such as Chris Brown, Christina Aguilera, Dr. Dre, Nas, Snoop Dogg 
and Pink, handed over a suitcase containing between $4,000 to $5,000, as
well as several pieces of jewelry.

The
thieves then took the keys to the SUV and ran off without firing a 
shot. Storch said he ran after them to see which direction they were 
headed buy they got away, TMZ reports.

The producer, who is in New York for this weekend's MTV VMAs, went to a nearby police station to report the incident.

Last year it was Storch himself on the wrong side of the law after being arrested for cocaine possession in Las Vegas.

He began his music career as keyboard player for seminal hip hop band The Roots.

He
went on to produce hits such as Dr Dre's 1999 smash 'Still D.R.E'., Fat
Joe's 2004 single 'Lean Back', and 2005's 'Candy Shop' for 50 Cent.

He reportedly amassed a $70million fortune but blew it on expensive cars, cocaine and a party lifestyle after moving to Hollywood.

He is said to have spent $30 million in just six months â€” much of which went on drugs.

Among his extravagant purchases were a private jet, a 117-foot yacht, and nearly twenty luxury cars, ten of which he estimates he purchased while high on cocaine.

In April 2009, he checked into a Hollywood rehab programme and filed for bankruptcy the following month.
