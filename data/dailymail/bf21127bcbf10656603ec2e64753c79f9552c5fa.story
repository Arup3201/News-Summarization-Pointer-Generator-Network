Hundreds of parents have been forced to miss work to look after their children after a flagship academy school announced it would be closing for three days because so many of its teachers are off sick.

St Aldhelm's Academy, in Poole, Dorset, closed with just a few hours' notice on Thursday because nine members of staff – which equates to a quarter of the teaching staff – called in sick.

Most of the absent teachers have been affected by 'winter viruses' while 'one or two' are suffering from stress, the school said. 

It added that it would not open until Wednesday at the earliest - meaning it will be closed for at least three school days.

The school, which last year lost £1.1million after falling for a simple email scam, closed to all but its Year 11 and Sixth Form pupils because of the shortages, forcing disgruntled parents to arrange last-minute childcare.

A text message was sent to parents at 9.45pm last Thursday warning them of the following day's closure.

Yesterday, parents were told the school - which caters for 469 pupils aged 11 to 19 - would not reopen to students until Wednesday at the earliest.

It also emerged that several Year 11 students who did turn up on Friday were sent home because they weren't wearing school uniform.

A spokesman for school sponsor the Diocese of Salisbury said it had taken the decision to shut the school after 'exhausting all other options'.

The spokesman added that the Diocese of Salisbury was merely an interim sponsor of the school until a new, permanent sponsor came forward.

He said: 'At present, nine staff are absent due to illness. We are working hard, with the support of the Department for Education to recruit supply teachers to ensure the school reopens fully.

'Our primary concern has always been the welfare and attainment of students at the Academy, and we remain committed to working with any future permanent sponsor to ensure as smooth a transition as possible.'

However, parents slammed the academy's administration at an emergency meeting organised by residents' group Bourne Valley Action Group.

Dawn Cummings, whose 15-year-old daughter Kyra Bartlett attends the school, said: 'I think it's disgusting. It's Kyra's GCSE year and she is willing to knuckle down and study but gets to school and there are no teachers.

'There has been lots of empty promises and meetings but they've all come to nothing. It's so frustrating because it's totally out of my hands. I can't send her to a different school because it's her last year.'

Parents have also taken to message boards to vent their anger and frustration at the school, which is one of the worst-performing in the country.

Kerry Forward said: 'This is unbelievable, this school is failing all its pupils.'

Jenny Garry wrote: 'Have some clever students hacked this account lol - surely they can't have that many staff off sick!'

And Matt Moses added: 'The school is so unorganised (sic), they need to sort themselves out and start doing some teaching.'

A letter to parents from Gerry Lynch, spokesman for the Diocese of Salisbury, which was sent yesterday, said: 'I regret to inform you that, as a number of staff remain absent due to illness, Years 7-10 at St Aldhelm's Academy will remain closed on Monday 9 February and Tuesday 10 February.

'Year 11 and the Sixth Form will remain open as normal.

'I apologise for the inconvenience this will undoubtedly cause many of you. It is a decision we have only taken after exhausting all other options.

'We will review the state of play on Tuesday and I will write to you early on the afternoon of Tuesday 10 February to keep you informed of further developments.

'In the meantime school work can be downloaded from the learning links on the academy website.'

The school was one of the first in the country to be given academy status in 2012 by former education secretary Michael Gove.

However, it is now facing permanent closure following a string of setbacks.

It was first was put into special measures in 2000 when it was known as Rossmore Community College.

Inspectors warned it to improve in 2008 following an unsatisfactory report and in 2011 it recorded the country's worst GCSE results, with just three per cent of students scoring the bench-mark five A*-C GCSE grades including English and maths.

The school improved its scores in 2012 and 2013 but it was put into special measures in December last year after inspectors gave it the lowest possible rating.

They said performance at the school had 'declined substantially since the previous inspection' and slammed staff for teaching up to five different lessons in the same classroom at the same time.

Last year the school sensationally lost £1.1million when finance staff fell for an email scam asking for details of its bank account.

The staff sent the details without questioning the email, allowing the con-artist to withdraw money from the account.

Bournemouth University was a co-sponsor of the school alongside the Diocese but pulled out in June last year. 

Conor Burns, MP for Bournemouth West, has now called for new governors to be installed at the school in a desperate bid to turn it around - but said closing the school permanently must be considered.

He said: 'We need ground zero now. We must step right back and refocus on the situation. Every option has got to be on the table, whether it's closure, splitting the campus so St Aldhelm's becomes a studio school or bringing in a new sponsor.

'There is no difference in my judgement between the calibre and talent of the students who go into the Bourne Academy and those who go into St Aldhelm's. Something is fundamentally, unacceptably wrong there.

'What we need is a new governing body, because the old governing body are inextricably linked to the previous failure, and a new sponsor who is absolutely committed to the academy and it just needs to happen quickly.'

A Department for Education spokesman said: 'We are aware that the Diocese of Salisbury has temporarily closed St Aldhelm's Academy. 

'The regional schools commissioner is working closely with the school and its sponsor to ensure that an appropriate plan is in place so that pupils' education can resume as soon as possible.' 

Dame Sally Coates, who is now a government adviser, rewarded teachers who took no sick days by giving them bottles of wine and book tokens

A former headteacher cracked down on the number of sick days taken by staff at her school by offering them bottles of wine and book tokens for good attendance.

Dame Sally Coates, who is now a government adviser, rewarded teachers who took no sick days by giving them incentives as part of her crackdown on recurrent absences.

While working at Burlington Danes Academy, in Hammersmith, west London, she also cut a third of the teaching staff and vowed to cut the £150,000-a-year bill for supply teachers – who were drafted in to cover sick days.

Prior to her taking over running of the school, staff had been told to ring a dedicated 'cover phone' if they were going to be off sick.

However, Dame Sally immediately pulled the plug on the phone and advised all staff they would have to phone the senior vice-principal before 7am if they planned to have the day off ill.

She said it allowed her to overhear their reasons for being off ill, and clamped down after hearing some of the excuses.

She told The Times: 'I would hear him [senior vice-principal] negotiating with staff. Often he would ask just how sick they were.

'How severe a headache? Have you taken a paracetamol? Can't your boiler be fixed at the weekend? Why don't you bring your child to school?

'A particular stand-out favourite of mine was: 'What do you mean your cat's hurt her paw?'

As part of her overhaul at the school, Dame Sally also refurbished the toilets, enlisted plants in the corridors, started punishing pupils who arrived late, installed table tennis tables in the playground and fitted doorstops in every classroom so doors could always be kept open.

Dame Sally, who also arrived at the school at 6am every morning during her time as headteacher, was praised with transforming the comprehensive grammar school from 'feral and toxic' to a success.
