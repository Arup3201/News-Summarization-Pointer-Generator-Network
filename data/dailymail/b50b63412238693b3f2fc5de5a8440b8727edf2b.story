An historic collection of some of the first photographs taken in China have sold for a staggering £40,000 - four times the estimated value.

The album of rare images and also watercolours was complied by a British interpreter who worked in the Far East  for 50 years in the 19th century.

Enterprising Herbert Elgar Hobson collected the shots of dignitaries, ships, landscapes and cities when he worked with the Chinese Maritime Customs Service - a governmental tax collection agency.

The collection - one of the best ever seen by experts - remained with his family until it sold for £40,000 at Dominic Winter auctioneers in Gloucestershire on Thursday.

The collection, here featuring distinctive architecture from the period, was sold at Dominic Winter auction rooms for four times it's estimate, at a staggering £40,000

Auctioneer and senior valuer Chris Albury said: 'It was an album of about 200 photographs and watercolours and printed items from between 1860 and 1870.

'They were collected by Herbert Elgar Hobson, who was an interpreter for General Gordon during the Taiping Rebellion.

'He was working out there with the Imperial Maritime Customs out in China and he worked out there for several decades.

'He compiled this album - it is very large - and it has stayed in the family hands until yesterday.

 'We had £10,000 to £15,000 on it as an album but there was a lot more interest in it than we expected.'

He added: 'It is very special and different.

The fascinating archive shows China at the birth of modern photography and features some of the country's first ever photographs

Herbert Elgar Hobson joined the Imperial Maritime Customs in China in 1861 and worked his way up to Commissioner in 1873- during which time, he took about 200 photographs

The photographs document an interesting time for China around the time of the Taiping Rebellion, a massive civil war in the south against the ruling Manchu Qing dynasty, and here features men wearing military dress

'People who view these things see a lot of them and they get jaded, but every now and then one comes a long and you say 'wow' - and this was one of those.

'It is more than the sum of its parts.

'It has some amazing photographs, some in fantastic condition.

'Everything in the album is annotated by Hobson in his own hand so it offers a fascinating insight into thoughts of the time. 

Hobson was born in Ashbourne, Derbyshire and arrived in Shanghai in August 1861 where he worked until his retirement in 1912

The album contained around 200 photographs and watercolour which were taken between 1860 and 1870

'When I first opened it I sat down and looked at it and when I finished I didn't know what to say.'

There were five bidders of the phone from America, the UK and China, as well as buyers in the room from France and Ireland and a handful of internet hopefuls.

The album - as well as a second smaller collection by the same collector - went to the same agent on the phone bidder from America.

Hobson was born in Ashbourne, Derbyshire and arrived in Shanghai in August 1861 where he worked until his retirement in 1912. 

On of the unique features of the album was that Hobson annotated each of the photographs in his own hand
