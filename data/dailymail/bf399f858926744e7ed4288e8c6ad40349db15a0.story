An Indian 'woman' who discovered she had mostly male DNA has given birth to twins.

Doctors have called the event a 'medical miracle' and said it is akin to a man giving birth.

The 32-year-old had an intersex condition, in which she had the physical appearance of a woman, but more than 95 per cent male chromosomes.

In humans, gender is determined by chromosomes. Women have XX chromosomes, while men have XY chromosomes.

Medical miracle: An Indian 'woman' who discovered she had 95 per cent male DNA has given birth to twins. The woman, who was treated in Meirut, looked female but had mostly male XX chromosomes. She had never gone through puberty, had no ovaries and had never menstruated - but she did have an undeveloped womb

The woman, whose chromosomes were almost entirely XY, did not undergo puberty and had never menstruated.

It was discovered she had an intersex condition when she went to seek fertility treatment in order to become pregnant.

'When we investigated further we found that she had a very small vagina and an infantile uterus,' fertility specialist Dr Sunil Jindal said.

An infantile uterus is an undeveloped womb.

Doctors diagnosed her with XY gonadal dysgenesis, in which a person has external female characteristics but ovaries that don't function, the Times of India reports.

Ovaries are usually necessary for reproduction, as they create and release the eggs from which babies grow.

The lady underwent more than 12 months of hormonal and other medical treatment to develop her 'infantile uterus' and allow her to eventually conceive.

XY gonadal dysgenesis is a rare intersex condition in which a person has external female characteristics but ovaries that don't function.

It affects one in a million people.

The chances of a person with this condition conceiving are very slim - and success is classed as a 'medical miracle', doctors said.

There have only ever been five reported cases of such pregnancies in the world.

'It is akin to a male delivering twins,' a fertility expert said. 

Her husband's sperm was used to fertilise a donor egg which was then implanted in the woman's uterus, which had been developed by the fertility treatment.

Once she became pregnant, doctors had to overcome another problem.

'Our biggest challenge was how to administer this pregnancy for nine months in a body not designed for it,' said Dr Anshu Jindal, medical director at Jindal Hospital, where the babies were delivered, told the Times of India.

On Friday she gave birth to a boy and girl.

'This is akin to a male delivering twins,' said Dr Jindal from the hospital in Meerut city, some 70 kilometres (43 miles) northeast of New Delhi.

Dr Jindal said his team of doctors discovered during their research that there had only ever been five reported cases of such pregnancies in the world.

'It's nothing short of a medical miracle. We are really happy that we could pull it off.'

He said the woman was startled to learn she had the condition, but was determined to undergo the treatment to get pregnant.

'Even she did not know she had this condition and was flabbergasted when we told her about it. But the husband was very supportive and told her "no matter what you continue to be my wife",' he said.

The babies were born through Caesarean section, weighing 2.25 kilos (4.9lb) 2.50 kilos (5.5 pounds) each.

Doctors diagnosed her with condition that is medically referred to as XY gonadal dysgenesis, in which a person has external female characteristics but ovaries that don't function. A human sex chromosome is pictured under the microscope. Men have XY chromosomes, while women have XX
