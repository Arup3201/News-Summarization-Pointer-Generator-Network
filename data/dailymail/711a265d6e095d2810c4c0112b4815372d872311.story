Britain is set to enjoy 10 days of uninterrupted sunshine thanks to a surprise spring heatwave, forecasters say.

Thousands are set to dig out their swimsuits and bikinis as the country looks set to bask in dry weather and temperatures of 17C for the next week and a half.

The forecast comes on the heels of England's first rain-free day after the wettest winter on record swamped swathes of low-lying land and battered our coastlines. Forecasters MetDesk released the graphic below as most of Britain enjoyed another day of beautiful spring weather, after the hottest day of the year so far on Sunday.

Jumping for joy: Hundreds of new borns will be brought into the world over the next few weeks at the Doe Farm, nestled in rural Teesdale, County Durham

Busy time: Once born, lambs and ewes stay in make shift beds on the straw lined floors and picket fences within the barns before heading out to the lush pastures

Looking good: These cumulative rainfall maps 
from MetDesk for yesterday (left) and today (right) show England and 
Wales is virtually rain-free

Looking ahead: A cumulative precipation forecast map from MetDesk for the ten days to March 22 shows England will experience very little rain

Meteorologists said that this is the 
start of the first prolonged dry spell for the country in three months -
 since the start of December. 

Leon
 Brown, a forecaster for the Weather Channnel, told the Daily Star that 
most of Britain will today bask in warm sunshine and temperatures of up 
to 17C.

The weekend would 
remain dry in the East and South, said Mr Brown, with bright and sunny 
weather expected. Then, on Sunday, the mercury could rise to an 
unseasonal 17C.

The South is
 expected to stay dry until the middle of next week, but some parts of 
north-west Scotland could see rain over the weekend, the forecaster 
added.

It came as Asda hailed the 'earliest ever start to barbecue season', with demand for the outdoor grills doubling.

Running and riding: Two women are seen exercising in the sun in front of beach huts on the sea front in Bournemouth, Dorset

Loving it: Couple are seen relaxing in their seats and on the sand at the beach in Bournemouth, which has seen a rise in visitors since the weather turned slightly warmer

While
 the rain is set to stay away in the coming days due to a band of high 
pressure, the Met Office has issued a fog warning this morning.

During
 the early hours of yesterday morning, night owls in Northumberland were
 treated to stunning natural displays as fog covered much of the North.

Alnwick
 Castle, which was used as Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in
 the first two Harry Potter films, was shrouded in fog last night.

Nearby,
 a rare sighting of a fogbow - formed by cloud and fog droplets â€“ was 
spotted as the moon cast its silver light through low-lying fog.

The
 setting moon also bleached low-lying fog by the A1 near Alnwick, with 
its silver glow silhouetting two dead trees to create an eerie scene.

Fog-warts: Alnwick Castle, which doubled as the home of Harry Potter's Hogwarts School, shrouded in fog last night as skies cleared in Northumberland

Waves coming in: Sea mist starts to lift at St Agnes, Cornwall, on another fine spring day for Britain

Bright day: A walker on the Coastal Path at Wheal Coates, a former tin mine, situated on the north coast of Cornwall near St Agnes

Beautiful start: The town of Alloa in Clackmannanshire, Scotland, visible through the early morning misty sunrise

Rebuilding project: Engineers from Network Rail carry out repair work to the Great Western Main Line in Dawlish, Devon - damaged during winter storms las

Today,
 overnight mist and fog will lift away to leave a dry and bright day 
across much of the UK with spells of sunshine on offer. 

Then tomorrow, it will be largely dry across England and Wales with fog and
 low cloud dispersing to allow for some sunny spells. 

The average temperature for March in the UK is around 10C (50F), but last Sunday it peaked at 20.5 (69F) in Gravesend, Kent.
