Kelly Rutherford has launched a dramatic legal bid to stop her son and daughter from ever returning to France where they live with her ex-husband - while the children are on holiday with her in New York.

The former Gossip Girl star has filed for an emergency motion to get custody before she has to put them on a plane on August 19.

That gives her just a week to convince a judge that her children had been ‘illegally deported’ to France by a California court which ruled they should live there with ex-husband Daniel Griesch.

Bittersweet: Kelly's two children have been spending their summer vacation with mom in New York. But they are supposed to return to their father Daniel Griesch on Augst 19

Emergency motion: The former Gossip Girl actress has petitioned the Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson and Attorney General Eric Holder claiming her children had been illegally deported and that they should stay in the US with her

The move is likely to enrage Griesch who potentially faces never seeing his seven-year-old son and five-year-old daughter again as he cannot travel to the US due to visa problems.

Having put them on a plane so they could spend time with their mother, if Kelly is successful in her attempt to keep the children in the US, he faces unimaginable heartbreak.

The court documents seen by MailOnline are the latest twist in a bitter battle that has gone on since Rutherford, 45, and Griesch, 39, a German businessman, divorced in 2010 after four years of marriage.

It has 
left Rutherford emotionally exhausted, desperate and having filed for 
bankruptcy with $2 million in debt after spending all her earnings from 
Gossip Girl on legal fees and flights to France to see her children.

MailOnline
 can reveal that Rutherford has filed a lawsuit at the Federal Appeals 
Court of the Southern District of New York in Manhattan on behalf of 
herself and her children.

She
 has sued the US government, including Attorney General Eric Holder and 
Jeh Johnson, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, because 
she claims that an earlier ruling by a California Superior Court judge 
that her children should live in France was unlawful. Only federal 
courts can deal with matters of deportation. she argues.

She
 wants the US District Court in New York court to grant her ‘temporary 
emergency authority’ over her children and an order saying the previous 
ruling was ‘unconstitutional’.

In strong language, Rutherford said it amounted to an ‘illegal deportation’.

The
 lawsuit states: ‘Emergency relief is necessary because the children are
 currently physically located in New York, but they are required to 
return to France on August 19, 2014…

Scene from a marriage: Kelly left Daniel Giersch in 2009 (pictured together) while she was pregnant with their second child after the German businessman's visa was revoked. A judge awarded him custody of the children in 2012

Tug of love: Rutherford says her ex has not made any attempt to obtain a visa so he can come visit to the US. The arrangement for the children to live with their father was ostensibly made because Griesch allegedly lied to get a visa in the past

‘...the children are left with no option but to seek relief from this court because there is no alternative means by which they can obtain a legal remedy allowing them to remain in their own country’.

The lawsuit says the case is ‘highly unusual’ and raises the possibility of Rutherford breaking the law to ensure that her children stay in the US.

It states that children’s ‘only hope of obtaining relief from this court would be to have their mother retain them in the United States, in violation of California order…

‘...Such an option would deny the children a meaningful remedy and expose the mother and the children to unjust punishment’.

But Wendy Murphy, Rutherford's attorney,  told MailOnline: 'Kelly has no intention of violating the California judge's order.

'This
 is about Kelly's children and their civil rights. This legal action is 
the only way for the children to enforce their rights as U.S. citizens.

'No
 person, especially an American child, should be forced to leave the 
United States unless a federal authority makes that decision in a manner
 consistent with the Constitution.

'That
 did not happen with Kelly's children and we are simply asking a federal
 authority to make a decision consistent with the children's fundamental
 rights as Americans.'

Rutherford also demands that steps be taken to see if Griesch could be given a visa to enter the US to see his children.

The only 
reason the current arrangements were decided as such was because he 
cannot enter the US, allegedly because he lied to get a visa in the 
past.

Rutherford,
 who played Blake Lively's mother in Gossip Girl, has custody of her 
children 50 per cent of the time but they live and go to school in 
France.

But the real issue is the rancor between the two sides, which has never been resolved.

According 
to court documents obtained by TMZ, trust broke down between the pair so
 badly that Rutherford hired a private eye to spy on Giersch 'in 
relation to certain issues regarding child custody and other matters'.

Soon
 after the birth of their daughter, who was born after they split, 
Giersch put out a statement which said: 'I was never informed by Kelly 
about the birth of our daughter, nor was I invited to attend.

Kelly films a scene from Gossip Girl with Blake Lively. Kelly says she spent all her earnings trying to win back her children

'In
 fact, I found out about it through Internet reports like everyone else.
 Although this sickens me, I am of course overjoyed that our baby was 
born healthy.

'I would’ve wanted nothing more than to hold our newborn daughter for a few moments, and I only seek to co-parent both our children responsibly and with love.'

Nobody from Giersch’s legal team was available for comment.
