Police and forensic experts were left baffled after what appeared to be a severed human finger, proved to be nothing more than a piece of convincing coral.

A local man had been walking his dog along the shore of Lee Point Beach in Darwin's north on Sunday when he made the initially horrifying discovery.

He promptly called triple zero, fearing that the flesh coloured object which even appears to have a fingernail, was evidence of a homicide.

Officers who arrived at the scene also treated the discovery as suspicious, assuming the suspected finger was likely to be human remains.

'The location was recorded and the finger, complete with fingernail, seized and sent for forensic examination,' watch commander Brendan Lindner said.

However, the forensic tests soon came back inconclusive and the finger was sent to pathology for further analysis.

Meanwhile officers at the Casuarina Police Station were left debating over whether the finger was real.

'The Negative ended up being correct, when the Pathologist determined that the pinky-lookalike was in fact plant material,' Mr Lindner revealed.

Despite the type of plant remaining unknown Mr Linder said that officers had concluded it was most likely the coral species Alcyonium digitatum, or Dead Man's Fingers, found in the northern hemisphere around the Atlantic Ocean.

'If this is correct, then it's worth pointing out that it is a finger after all, just not the human kind!' he said.

'The investigation is now finalised and the suspicious pinky will be disposed of.'
