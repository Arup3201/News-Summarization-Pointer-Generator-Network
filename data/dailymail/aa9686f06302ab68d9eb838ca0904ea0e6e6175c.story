Andrew Flintoff is off the mark in Australia's Big Bash League after taking two wickets for Brisbane Heat in their one-run win over the Melbourne Stars. 

Flintoff took a battering in the last of his four overs as Stars' left-hander Rob Quiney smashed 21 runs in his almost match-winning innings of 43 from 31 balls.

That flurry made his figures of 2-41 look expensive, but his scalps - dangerous big-hitters James Faulkner and John Hastings - taken as the Stars mounted a late charge were invaluable to his side's win.

It was a marked improvement on Flintoff's first appearance for the Heat which saw a third-ball duck and his two overs going for 12.5 apiece as Michael Hussey and Jacques Kallis smashed 96 and 97 not out respectively for the Sydney Thunder. 

Flintoff claimed Faulkner, a figure who haunts many an international T20 side for his late-innings heroics, with a ball full on middle and off that caught a leading edge that floated to the safe hands of James Hopes at extra cover.

With the last ball of that third over Flintoff went wide of the crease to Hastings, who in trying a desperate heave over mid-wicket managed only to be clean bowled.

Despite Quiney's heroics, the Stars fell one run short in their attempt to run down the Heats 164 for eight

Flintoff was earlier run out from the last ball of the Heat's innings as they finished with 164 for 8, with Chris Lynn top-scoring with 48 from 34 balls. 

Coming on first change, 37-year-old Flintoff was relatively tight as England's Luke Wright got Stars' chase off to a decent start with 33 from 23 balls before being caught by Hopes from Dan Christian.

In the penultimate over of the chase, Scott Boland took a single to bring in-form Quiney on strike and the Victorian who was dumped from Australia's Test team after two matches unleashed.

Quiney crushed two sixes and a four (only one other boundary came from Flintoff's bowling), along with a pair of twos.

Boland got Quiney on strike again with the first ball of Ryan Duffield's closing over, but Quiney could manage just one six and got three (after being dropped at midwicket) when he needed five from the last ball.
