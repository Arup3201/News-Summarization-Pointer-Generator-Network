She's widely touted as one of the most naturally beautiful women in Hollywood, and Jessica Alba most certainly proves her worth in her new campaign.

The actress, 33, is the campaign star of the Braun Face Christmas imagery - an epilator that doubles as a deep-pore cleansing brush - and she credits the gadget for giving her glowing skin.

Posing in a red dress, waving her glossy hair, the mother-of-two opens up about her plans for the festive season. 

New campaign: Jessica Alba, 33, is the campaign star of the Braun Face - an epilator that doubles as a deep-pore cleansing brush - and she has revealed her favourite things about the festive period 

Recently awarded with the Mum of the Year title - and often regarded as a role model for women all over the world - Jessica believes that gift giving is as the 'glue' for a family and for a relationship.

She said: 'Birthdays and other family occasions are really important for every family. It’s a great feeling to find that perfect gift for the ones you love, whether it’s for your mum, your sister, your husband, your kids or your closest friends. 

'I think getting a present right is always about finding a good balance between creativity, knowing the needs of the person you want to give a present to, and if the present itself stands for something.'

Jessica has been working with the beauty giant since March this year and the stylish mother-of-two is the perfect advert for the healthy lifestyle she advocates in the accompanying imagery.

Speaking about their choice, a spokesperson for the beauty brand said at the time: 'Jessica Alba is a strong, passionate woman and an advocate for others - she is the perfect ambassador to talk about the role beauty and our products play in helping women to feel their best.

'Braun admires her for her principles, her talents and her ability to juggle a demanding acting career with being a great mum.' 

As well as glowing skin, Jessica Alba is known for having one of the best bodies in Hollywood.

And on Sunday  the 33-year-old gave fans a behind-the-scenes look into how she maintains such a trim and toned physique.

The actress and co-founder of The Honest Company shared a video to Instagram showing her working out while on location in Thailand for the filming of upcoming action flick Mechanic: Resurrection.

Alba's on-set trainer Omar Lopez is described as 'a Hatha Yoga, dynamic proprioception, resistance training and strength training expert' with 'elite level dance experience' on the website of a gym he is employed by.

A week before, on November 18, Jessica shared a photo flaunting her flexed muscles and trim midsection following a recent sweat session at celebrity-favourite spinning studio Soul Cycle.

The photo read, 'W my wrkout #rideordie this AM @thall1433 & teach #cole #motivated #movember', referring to her fundraising efforts for the men's health awareness foundation through the trendy growing of moustaches in November. 

Her team of 97 members, titled Honest Jessica, had raised $5,368 as of November 23.

Jessica's increased gym visits appear to correlate with her filming schedule, as she has just begun filming in Bangkok, Thailand alongside Jason Statham and Tommy Lee Jones.

According to IMDb, her new crime thriller Mechanic: Resurrection follows Arthur Bishop (Statham) who 'thought he had put his murderous past behind him when his most formidable foe kidnaps the love of his life. Now he is forced to travel the globe to complete three impossible assassinations, and do what he does best, make them look like accidents'.

It is expected to be released in January 2016.
