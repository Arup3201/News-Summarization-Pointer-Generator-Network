Six teenage girls have sparked anger after taking a photo of themselves dressed in white hats and white shirts - similar to the outfits worn by Klu Klux Klan members - and posting it online.

The unidentified students, who attend Nash Central High School in North Carolina, captured the image in November amid protests over the grand jury's verdict in the Michael Brown shooting case.

In the controversial picture - taken out of school hours and off campus - they can be seen donning white cone-shaped hats and white shirts, while pointing their fingers at the camera like guns.

The girls later posted the photo to Instagram, prompting outrage from residents, parents and other students, with many claiming the teenagers were deliberately dressed like KKK members.

Others deemed the image 'threatening' in a state which has established KKK groups, while some highlighted the fact that it was posted online at a time when racial tensions were high across America.

All claimed Nash Central's school board had repeatedly ignored their concerns over the picture - which was uploaded to the social networking platform on November 26 - for the past two months.

On Monday evening, Rocky Mount residents and parents crowded into the Nash Rocky Mount School System auditorium to complain about the 'KKK-inspired' photo to the board, ABC 7 reported.

The turnout  was so high that some people were even forced to stand outside, in the hallway.

Addressing the board, Rocky Mount parent Monica Gilmore said: 'The incident of the young women posing as KKK members was a threat to our children and community.'

Resident Bronson Williams added: 'It seems to be the opinion of this school district that if we are offended, to shut up and be quiet.'

However, Nash County Sheriff Keith Stone, who also attended the meeting, emphasized that the photo was taken after school hours and at an off-campus site.

'In my opinion, I saw no laws that were violated,' he said, adding that his department had carried out an investigation and questioned both the girls and their parents.

The school board also confirmed that an international investigation had taken place, but refused to say how or if the students were disciplined for 'privacy' reasons.

Just two days before the photo was posted online, the grand jury in Ferguson, Missouri, decided not to indict white officer Darren Wilson in the shooting death of Brown, an unarmed black 17-year-old.

The decision sparked violent protests across America. Demonstrators' rage was further ignited in December when another grand jury chose not to indict an officer in the killing of Eric Garner.

Garner, a 43-year-old father of six, died after he was apparently placed in a 'chokehold' by officer Daniel Pantaleo on Staten Island, New York. 

The girls  in the 'KKK-themed' photo are reportedly being escorted to school this week due to threats.
