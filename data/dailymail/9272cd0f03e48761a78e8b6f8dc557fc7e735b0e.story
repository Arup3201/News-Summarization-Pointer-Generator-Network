A 91-year-old graduate who built up a £4,500 fine after returning a library book 61 years late has been left off.

Ron Webster borrowed Professor AR Radcliffe-Brown's Structure and Function in Primitive Society in 1953 from the University of Liverpool.

The sciences postgraduate student was then warned by his friends he would have built up a hefty fee, so decided to return the book.

But when he arrived at the university's campus, librarian Phil Sykes waived the fee because he said Mr Webster had lived an 'exemplary life'.

The total was calculated on the basis of the current charge of 20p per day for late return of books.

He borrowed the book because it contained a section on the anthropology of joking relationship - a convention where two tribes are allowed to make fun of each other.

The premise underpinned interviews and fieldwork Mr Webster carried out with Liverpudlian and Salford Dockers.

When he was sorting through his personal library retired Mr Webster discovered the oversight and realised he may be facing a hefty fine.

But rather than pop it back on the shelf, Ron decided a trip back to his old Liverpool haunts was in order and a return to the red brick institution on Brownlow Hill.

Mr Webster who worked for Ford after finishing his studies, and son-in-law Rick Walker called in to the university's Sydney Jones Library to drop off the long overdue book.

Mr Walker, who was worried that an enormous fine would be handed to Ron and possible legal action, said: 'They didn't expect to see him again.'

'Ron had been warned very firmly by the friends he plays cards with at the local pub that he would be landed with an enormous fine and feel the full force of the law.'

Kind-hearted librarian Phil Sykes kindly waived the £4,510 fine, providing Mr Webster goes on to live an 'exemplary life' and return library books on time in the future.
