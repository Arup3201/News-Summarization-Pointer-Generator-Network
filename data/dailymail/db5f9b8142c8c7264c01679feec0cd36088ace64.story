Notorious murderer Kenny Noye (pictured) could walk free within weeks after being granted a parole hearing

The father of the young man murdered by gangster Kenneth Noye in a road rage attack reacted angrily yesterday after it emerged he could be freed from prison in weeks.

Noye, now 67, was jailed for life in 2000 for the murder of 21-year-old Stephen Cameron in a road rage attack four years earlier.

He used a 9in knife he kept in his car to stab Mr Cameron on a slip road of the M25 near Swanley, Kent, as the victim's 17-year-old fiancee, Danielle Cable, looked on in horror.

The killing triggered an international hunt for Noye, who had already served 14 years in jail for his part in the Brink's-Mat bullion robbery in 1983.

But now – just 15 years after he was locked up – he has been granted a parole hearing after officials said he was a model prisoner and should be considered for release.

Stephen's father Ken Cameron insisted yesterday that Noye – who also killed a policeman in the 1980s but was cleared of murder – should never be let out of prison.

At his home in East Anglia, Mr Cameron, 68, said: 'He left my son dying in the gutter and fled to Spain. I don't believe he has changed his ways.

'He'll always be a dangerous man. People will say anything when they are up for parole. Noye should never be allowed out of prison – he is an evil man and has never shown remorse.' He added: 'We still keep in touch with the detectives from the case. They tell me he comes across as the model prisoner but... I think he tells them what they want to hear.'

Mr Cameron said there was a meeting between probation and police this week to discuss the case and Noye's parole hearing could be held as early as May. Noye is currently at Category C Wayland Prison in Norfolk.

Mr Cameron said: 'We live in the same region as the prison. What I don't want is him being allowed out on shopping trips. I fear one of us could bump into him in the street.'

Mr Cameron's wife Toni, who is in her early 70s, said: 'We're disgusted. We don't think he should be allowed a hearing. Life should mean life. We have written a letter to the Home Secretary with our complaint.'

Danielle Cable's father Jimmy, 57, said he will 'never forgive' Noye for what he did. His daughter was put in the witness protection programme, meaning he can see her and his granddaughter just twice a year.

Speaking from his home in Orpington, Kent, he said: 'Why should they let him out? It has affected my family so much. I can't believe he could be released, it shouldn't happen.'

At Noye's trial, he admitted that he had stabbed Stephen Cameron to death but insisted that he had acted in self-defence. However the jury convicted him of murder after a pathologist said Mr Cameron's injuries were consistent with murderous intent.

Noye had previously stabbed to death Detective Constable John Fordham in the grounds of his 20-acre mansion in West Kingsdown, Kent, in 1985. At the trial, he said he had acted in self-defence – and was dramatically cleared of murder.

The following year, he was convicted of handling Brink's-Mat gold and jailed for 14 years. During the infamous robbery, six gunmen burst into a warehouse near Heathrow Airport and doused security guards in petrol before escaping with £26million.

The Parole Board confirmed Noye's case had been referred to it, but added it 'can only direct the release of a life sentence prisoner if it is satisfied that it is no longer necessary for him to be detained in order to protect the public from serious harm. Each case is assessed on its own merits.'
