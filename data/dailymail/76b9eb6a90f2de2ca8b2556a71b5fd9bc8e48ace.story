Spanking and caning are among acts banned from online porn videos filmed in the UK, the Government has said.

A list of sex acts, some featured in the erotic novel Fifty Shades of Grey, are now on a list of 'harmful' content that has been prohibited.  

A quiet change in legislation has ruled that paid-for online porn videos must now adhere to the same rules as content produced for sex shop-type videos.

A number of 'Fifty Shades of Grey' style sex acts have been banned from online porn made in the UK. A movie based on the erotic novel is currently being made staring Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson (pictured)

It means acts that would not be classified as an R18 rating, in line with guidelines laid out by the British Board of Film Censors (BBFC), are prohibited.

The list of around 10 acts reportedly range from spanking to strangulation.

Critics argue the change not only damages the country's porn industry, with online viewers still able to access content banned in the UK by watching videos filmed abroad, but amounts to 'arbitrary censorship'.

Jerry Barnett, founder of anti-censorship campaign Sex And Censorship, told Vice: 'R18 is a strange thing.

'It's a set of weird and arbitrary censorship rules decided between the BBFC, the police and the CPS (Crown Prosecution Service).

'There appear to be no rational explanations for most of the R18 rules - they're simply a set of moral judgments designed by people who have struggled endlessly to stop the British people from watching pornography.'

Spanking and whipping, which are featured in the saucy novel Fifty Shades of Grey, are on the banned list, as well as: 

Aggressive whipping 

Physical or verbal abuse (regardless of if consensual)  

Strangulation 

The Audiovisual Media Services Regulation 2014 came in to effect on Monday.

A spokesman for the Department of Culture, Media and Sport said: 'The legislation provides the same level of protection to the online world that exists on the high street in relation to the sale of physical DVDs.

'In a converging media world these provisions must be coherent and the BBFC classification regime is a tried and tested system of what content is regarded as harmful for minors.'

Others have criticised the new legislation for cutting back on acts associated with women's pleasure.

Erotic film director Erika Lust told the Independent: 'With this legislation, the UK is in danger of finding itself back in an age where porn is simply the boring, unrealistic, male fantasy of bimbos eagerly pleasing men as if it is their duty, where women are submissive and lack ownership of their sexuality.

'Women in the industry will now fear the loss of their livelihoods as well as their sexual independence.'
