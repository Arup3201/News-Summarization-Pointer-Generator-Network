Lucky escape: A sturdy bra has saved a woman's life after its metal underwiring stopped a stray bullet from hitting her in the chest her during a robbery in Brazil

When she realised she was not bleeding, she presumed she had not been hit after all and thanked God for sparing her life.

But she then felt 'a little burning sensation' and after finding the source of the pain, discovered the bullet lodged in her underwear. 

In an interview filmed after the terrifying event, she holds up her dress to show reporters where the bullet had torn it as it sped towards her heart.

She then reveals the black lace underwired bra she had been wearing - and points to where the bullet was stopped. 

Accidental deaths from stray bullets are alarmingly common in Brazil, where more than five million people live below the poverty line, fuelling crime in the country
