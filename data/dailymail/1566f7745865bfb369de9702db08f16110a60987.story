A women lost an astonishing 13st in a year - after finding she could barely make it up the stairs after the lift broke at work.

Alison Robbins, 40, had to scale just four flights of steps but could not make it without gasping for breath and having to stop a couple of times.

She was humiliated when a colleague 25 years older effortlessly strolled straight past her and finally decided to tackle her lifelong weight problem. 

When the lift broke at her office, Alison, who weighed 23st, was humiliated when she found she struggled to climb the stairs

Alison weighed 23st and  could only just squeeze into size 22 clothing but in just a year has managed to slim down to 10 stone and drop to a trim size 12.

Alison, who works for Allianz insurance, said: 'I had to send my friend on ahead of me because I was so out of breath after climbing only two flights of stairs.

'It was very embarrassing because she is 25 years older than me.

'I thought 'she's fine and I'm here nearly dying'. I decided that in the New Year I would make a change for good. 

Alison embarked on a strict diet and took up exercise, managing to drop down to 10st and size 12 in a year

'I knew I needed to lose weight, not just for my self esteem but also for my health. I had reached rock bottom and I wanted to do something about it.'

Alison said her weight problems began at secondary school when she was physically and mentally tormented by classmates, deeply affecting her self esteem.

Single Alison, now 41, added: 'I have always struggled with my weight and yo-yoed between dieting and comfort eating since I was 16 years old.

'I have gone from a size 10 to a size 28 and then back again.

'I have never felt comfortable with the way I looked and hated having my photo taken or looking in the mirror.

It was the incident at her office, pictured, that was the prompt Alison needed to finally stop yo-yo dieting

 'As I piled on the weight I became even more depressed and started eating even more and I spent years caught in this vicious cycle.

'I needed to reach an all-time low in order to force me to do something about my weight and eating habits once and for all.'

She joined a local Weight Watchers group in Yate, South Gloucestershire, and stuck to a strict diet and tough Zumba exercise timetable.

Alison now routinely takes the stairs at work, even though the lift has long since been fixed.

And she still attends a weekly Weight Watchers group as she is determined to keep her new trim figure.

The group is led by Michelle Head who said: 'I am so proud of Alison.

'She has been such a huge inspiration to myself and the other members of our Weight Watchers meeting.

'She is proof that you can lose weight and keep it off and still enjoy life, including tempting times like summer holidays, birthdays and celebrations.'
