At first glance, you wouldn’t even think it’s a seat. The Limbic, which I’m getting acquainted with in the picture on the right, looks like some fiendish device designed for torture.

But this extraordinary item is, in fact, the most elaborate, painstakingly constructed and expensive office chair in the world.

It is designed to counteract what is arguably the most common health problem: a bad back. About 7.6 million working days are lost to this complaint annually in Britain.

The catch is that the chair costs almost £8,000. Yes, £8,000! So what makes it so special? ‘It allows more freedom of movement than any other chair I’ve ever seen,’ says posture expert Roger Golten, who has brought the Limbic chair to the UK.

‘If you are spending many hours at a desk, it’s the only chair that will actually maintain your health. As you sit in it, you are constantly making micro-movements, which is what you need to do to keep your back healthy.

‘Sitting is one of the biggest problems for modern human health. We have legs, not roots. We were designed to move.’

IT FEELS LIKE FLYING!When you sit on the Limbic, a carbon-fibre shell wraps around each leg. Each shell can pivot independently so, after getting my balance, I found I could stretch, lean and twist forwards, backwards and from side to side. It’s a bit like flying.

You also feel like smiling – not an emotion I usually associate with being seated at a desk, especially as I have a dodgy back. By enabling you to move so freely, the chair is said to stimulate the limbic area of the brain – the seat of emotions – and so make you feel happier, too.

OUT OF THE SADDLEThe root of my back problem lies in a couple of herniated discs near the base of my spine, along with a bunch of muscle imbalances too dull to divulge.

Suffice to say the result is that a normal office chair – one that obliges my spine to rest at 90 degrees to my thighs – soon becomes painful to use.

I’ve tried all sorts of alternatives. For years I had a ‘kneeling chair’ – a backless contraption that lets you sit with your knees lower than your hips – but I later learned it’s not recommended for all-day use.

Osteopath Tim Allardyce recommends five things to help preserve your posture and your spine while in the office .  .  . and none costs more than £60!

Staples Ocean Operator Chair £54 This provides everything you need from an office chair – it swivels, its height and angle can be changed, and it is comfortable.staples.co.uk

Allsop Monitor Stand Cupertino £41.67It is crucial to have a monitor at eye level – any lower and your back will round as you look down. onebigdot.com

Lapjack Laptop Stand £59.99 Laptops make you bend your neck and round your back. This stand helps you keep a better position. Must be used with an external keyboard wellworking.co.uk

The Original McKenzie Super Lumbar Roll £18.99 A piece of foam that fixes to your chair, this preserves the natural curve of the back, which most of us lose when sitting. healthandcare.co.uk

Posturite Freestander £49.95Allows documents to be held at an angle, otherwise you will stoop.  posturite.co.uk

I also invested in a Bambach saddle seat, which looks like a saddle on a pole and felt comfortable.

Then my physio said that a seat with a back would be kinder to my ageing vertebrae, to give them an occasional rest. But do I really need to invest in the Limbic?

STAY ON THE MOVE‘For people who don’t have an injury, there is fairly standard guidance on what is a good sitting posture,’ says Laurence Clift, senior lecturer in ergonomics at the University of Loughborough.

‘That means feet flat on the floor, knees at 90 degrees, a 90-degree bend at the pelvis, and support throughout.

‘But you can’t generalise about people who have an injury as each problem is different, which is why it’s best to get an occupational nurse to inspect your seating and to give advice.

‘Some people stick cushions on to a chair so it feels nice, but the best thing is to get up from your desk regularly and walk about.

That will help relieve the pressure on your spine and move fluid around the vertebrae to keep everything working smoothly.’

Osteopath Tim Allardyce is adamant that most of us needn’t break the bank to stave off, or cope with, back pain.

‘It is ridiculous to think you have to spend £8,000 to achieve good posture,’ he says.

‘This chair is designed to keep you mobile but you could get similar benefits from sitting on a Swiss ball or a saddle stool, which separates your legs slightly. Both can be bought for less than £40.

‘Anyone with major back ache should speak to a doctor or osteopath. Ultimately, exercise will mobilise your back and stimulate your limbic system more than any chair – however expensive it is.’
