Britain will not 'align' with Syrian dictator Bashar Assad to defeat the growing threat posed by Islamic State fighters, the Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond insisted today.

Mr Hammond said Britain may have a 'common enemy' with the Syrian regime but added: 'That doesn't make us friends. It doesn't make us able to trust them, it doesn't enable use to work with them.' 

His remarks came after Lord Dannatt, the former Chief of the General Staff, said it was impossible to fight Islamic State terrorists in Iraq while allowing them to retain their stronghold in bordering Syria.

The peer said Britain would eventually have to work with President Assad to defeat the  insurgency by getting his approval for a bombing campaign in Syria.

The row came after the French President Francois Hollande appeared to blame Britain for the rise of Islamic State – also known as ISIS or ISIL.

President Hollande suggested that Parliament decision to block airstrikes on Syria had allowed the terror organisation to flourish, because it had ended any hope of replacing President Assad with members of the moderate opposition fighting him. 

In August last year, the Prime Minister was humiliated when Labour MPs and Tory rebels defeated the Government, ruling out military action against Assad.

The French President said: ‘If, two years ago, we had acted to ensure a transition, we wouldn’t have had Islamic State. If, one year ago, the major powers had reacted to the use of chemical weapons, we wouldn’t have had this terrible choice between a dictator and a terrorist group.’

Former British military chief Lord Dannat rejected President Hollande’s claim – arguing that Parliament had been right to reject military action against Syria.

He said: ‘It’s clearly turned out over the past two or three years to be a very diverse, very complicated country – and I think the reason why quite rightly the British Parliament voted against intervention a year ago and we didn’t join American airstrikes is that we couldn’t be certain who we would be supporting.’

A former Government advisor on anti-terror laws has called on the Government to reintroduce tougher police powers to track extremists.

Lord Carlile, former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation for the Government, said the decision to scrap Labour’s control order system in favour of more limited terrorism prevention and investigation measures should be revisited.

Lord Carlile said: ‘I do think the Government could make a legislative response to the current problem by reintroducing control orders, or beefed-up Tpims, as they are called, to ensure that people who are identified by solid intelligence as presenting this kind of risk can be placed under controls which can prevent them activating their ideas.

‘I think that we can demonstrate that, certainly in the last six or seven years of control orders, they were very effective, including a provision that allowed certain people - if a judge agreed, a very senior judge - to be relocated.

‘Of course, there are no Tpims at all at the moment. The Tpims that were created ran out and the Government decided to have no more, for reasons which I have never understood.’

The remarks are a blow to the Home Secretary Theresa May, who has insisted the public are not in any more danger as a result of watering down the previous Government’s anti-terror legislation.

It came as it emerged today that an independent watchdog called for stricter controls on terror suspects months ago.

David Anderson QC, the independent reviewer of counter-terrorism legislation, said changes to the Government's Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures which replaced Labour control order regime, to make them more effective. 

But he added: ‘What do we do about Assad? 

'I think whether it’s above the counter or below the counter a conversation has to held with him because if there is going to be any question of air strikes over Syrian airspace it has to be with the Assad regime’s approval.’

Lord Dannat said: ‘The old saying my enemy’s enemy is my friend has begun to have some resonance with our relationship with Iran and I think it’s going to have to have some resonance with our relationship with Assad.’

But Mr Hammond rejected the former Army chief’s proposal.

He said: 'General Dannatt I heard talking about the adage that “my enemy’s enemy is my friend”. I’ve said very often that one of the first things you learn in the Middle East is that “my enemy’s enemy is not necessarily my friend”.

He added: ‘We may very well find that we are aligned against a common enemy, but that doesn’t make us friends with someone. It doesn’t make us able to trust them, it doesn’t enable us to work with them.

‘It would poison what we are trying to achieve in separating moderate Sunni opinion from the poisonous ideology of [IS] if we were to align ourselves with President Assad.’

The Foreign Secretary also said that he does not believe the President has the authority to reject military intervention from other countries.

He said: ‘I don’t know where the idea comes from that Assad has to assent to a military intervention in his country, there’s a civil war raging in his country.’

Mr Hammond also rejected that Britain would be providing lethal support to the Syrian moderate opposition.

Defeating the Islamic State terror network will require the US and its allies to take on the terror group in Syria, America’s top-ranking military official said last night.

Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that the group could not ultimately be beaten without Syria featuring in America’s broader strategy alongside the airstrikes Washington is currently carrying out in Iraq.

General Dempseys said: ‘This is an organisation that has an apocalyptic, end of days strategic, vision that will eventually have to be defeated.

‘Can they be defeated without addressing that part of the organisation that resides in Syria? The answer is no.

‘They will have to be addressed on both sides of what is at this point a non-existent border. That will come when we have a coalition that takes on the task of defeating Isis over time.’

The comments, delivered in a joint briefing with Chuck Hagel, the US defence secretary, came as Washington continued its assault campaign against the militant group in Iraq, targeting areas close to the beleaguered Mosul dam, according to the Pentagon.

Mr Hagel, for his part, refused to rule out the prospect of US airstrikes in Syria, saying that the administration was ‘exploring all options’.

He insisted that the Islamic State posed one of the biggest terror threats the world had yet seen, warning that defeating the group would be a long-term mission.

‘They are beyond just a terror group. This is beyond anything we’ve ever seen,’ said Mr Hagel, noting that the organisation was extremely well funded and ‘sophisticated’.

General Dempsey added that immediate threat stemmed from the risk of jihadists from Europe returning to their home nations with plans of attack on their own soil. ‘They can go home at any point,’ he said.

The Islamic State insurgency in northern Iraq and Syria is, it seems, leading to a significant redrawing of political allegiances across the Middle East – at least temporarily.

Calls for political engagement with the Ba'athist regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad as well as the theocrats of Iran have made them unlikely potential bedfellows of the U.S. and its European allies.

Just 12 months ago, Western lawmakers were seriously debating launching air strikes against Syrian Army positions in an effort to halt its resistance to rebels who sought to overthrow the dictatorship.

Now those very rebels' Syrian strongholds are all but in the sights of the U.S. Air Force's drones and bombers, while a senior UK parliamentarian has identified Assad as the enemy's enemy who is now our friend.

Iran too was facing the threat of military action to halt the nuclear programme which Israel, in particular, feared was working towards an atomic weapons programme.

But with the U.S. saying it may deploy limited 'boots on the ground' to defend American interests in Baghdad there is the bizarre prospect of GIs standing shoulder to shoulder with Iranian Revolutionary Guards already stationed in Iraq.

Meanwhile, Israel's recent air and ground offensive in the Gaza Strip, ostensibly against Hamas militants but effectively hitting thousands of Palestinian civilians, has seen the Jewish state's international standing plummet. 

And there are questions about how far Islamic State's power and influence is down to the help of wealthy individuals in Saudi Arabia, the oil-rich U.S. ally.

The kingdom is well-known for espousing a fanatic form of Sunni Islam known as Wahhabism, whose adherents, like the Islamic State's militants, are violently opposed to the beliefs of Shia Muslims in Iraq and elsewhere.
