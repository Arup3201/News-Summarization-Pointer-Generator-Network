About 1,000 mourners gathered alongside family, friends and senior military figures for the funeral of Corporal Channing Day in Northern Ireland today.

The 25-year-old Army medic killed in Afghanistan was buried with full military honours after a service in her home town of Comber, County Down.

A minute's silence was held at the town's war memorial before the funeral cortege made its way to First Comber Presbyterian Church.

About a thousand mourners gathered to
hear Lauren Day tell of the family's 'pride' in her 'brave, beautiful, 
and determined' sister.

Corporal
Day, of 3 Medical Regiment, was killed alongside Corporal David 
O'Connor, of 40 Commando, during a firefight in the Nahr-e Saraj 
district of Afghanistan's Helmand Province last month. They had been 
overseeing the training of Afghan local police when their patrol came 
under fire near the village of Char Kutsa.

The Ministry of Defence said an initial review into their deaths has revealed the killings were not caused by 'friendly fire'.

Corporal Day was the third female soldier to have died in combat since British military operations began in Afghanistan in 2001.

Military padre Reverend Albert Jackson led this afternoon's funeral service.

In a tribute, Corporal Day's sister Lauren described the young soldier as brave, beautiful and determined.

'Channing
loved the Army. If there was one thing she knew growing up, it was that
she wanted to be a soldier, proven by the way she would march around 
the living room and never missed cadets', said Ms Day.

'She loved what she did and we are so proud of her.

'Channing grew up into the bravest, beautiful, determined woman.

'She has done more in her 25 years than most women her age and we are so very proud of everything she has achieved.'

Reverend Jackson told mourners that their huge turnout was testament to the esteem with which Corporal Day was held.

He said: 'Channing’s passion in life from an early age was to be a soldier.

Army Chaplain Reverend Albert Jackson said the number of people that turned out was testament to the esteem in which Corporal Day was held

'That was her goal. She wanted to be one of the best. She wanted to be the best.'

Reverend Jackson described combat medics as angels in disguise and said Corporal Day had been willing to face the same dangers as her male military colleagues.

'She was out on the ground with the lads. She was one of them.'

Corporal Day
was born in Swindon, Wiltshire, but grew up in County Down. She joined 
the Army in 2005 and had completed tours of duty in Iraq and 
Afghanistan.

Speaking after
the service, Major Kevin Smith, Officer Commanding 3 Medical Regiment, 
said her loss had had a deep impact on the regiment.

'Channing
was an exemplar of a professional soldier; universally respected for 
her diligence, her willingness to put herself in harms way and her total
professionalism.

'Obviously [her death] was a tragic event and it has deeply affected not only those who are still deployed but also the 60 or so members of the regiment who are still here in the UK.

'But, those deployed have a job to do and they have to continue to do that.

'It is no more poignant to have lost a woman. We have lost one of our own, it doesn’t matter who they are.'

Meanwhile,
Prime Minister David Cameron said that the UK owed Corporal Day and 
others who have lost their lives in Afghanistan a deep debt of gratitude.

437 British service personnel have been killed in Afghanistan since the 2001 invasion.

The
families of two Gurkhas killed by a man wearing an Afghan police 
uniform broke down into tears today as their bodies were repatriated to 
the UK.

Lieutenant 
Edward Drummond-Baxter and Lance Corporal Siddhanta Kunwar, of 1st 
Battalion The Royal Gurkha Rifles, were shot dead at a checkpoint in 
Nahr-e Saraj, Helmand Province on October 30.

The
men were killed in the latest 'green-on-blue' attack on British troops 
in Afghanistan, bringing the number of British servicemen killed by 
Afghan soldiers or police to 11 this year.

The bodies of Lt 
Drummond-Baxter, 29, and L/Cpl Kunwar, 28, were flown into RAF Brize 
Norton in Oxfordshire, where the Union flag-draped coffins were carried 
from the plane with full military honours.

Following
private services, the two families arrived at the memorial garden in 
Carterton where they stood in silence along with more than 100 friends 
and well-wishers who fell quiet as a bell began to toll.

Royal
British Legion standard-bearers slowly lowered their flags as family 
members started to sob when they caught sight of the cortege.

The
hearses paused briefly next to a Union flag hung at half mast to allow 
family members and friends to step forward and place flowers on top of 
the cars. Several white scarfs were also tied to both of the hearses.

As the cars pulled away there was a round of applause by members of the public who came to pay their respects.

Lt
Drummond-Baxter and L/Cpl Kunwar were attached to 40 Commando Royal 
Marines and were attending a meeting with Afghan uniformed policemen 
when one of the men opened fire, the Ministry of Defence said.

Lt
Drummond-Baxter, who was born in Peterborough and lived in County 
Durham, was on his first tour of Afghanistan having been deployed on 
September 30.

His 
mother Helen, father David and sister Emily issued a statement saying: 
'Edward was fiercely loyal and totally sincere to his parents, sister 
and many friends who are mourning him today, both in the UK and around 
the world.

'He loved the Gurkhas and died among friends doing the job that he wanted to do.'

L/Cpl
Kunwar deployed to Afghanistan on October 3 as a sniper section 
commander in the acting rank of Lance Corporal. He lived in Pokhara, 
Nepal, with his mother and father before joining the Gurkhas.

The
soldier leaves his father, Shyam Kumar Kunwar, stepmother, Chhali Devi 
Kunwar, his four sisters, Shova, Shyandya, Smita and Sardha Kunwar, and 
his elder brother, Bhupendra Kunwar.

His family said: 'We are deeply shocked, disheartened and in disbelief that Siddhanta is no longer with us.

'But we shall treasure all the good things he did. He enjoyed immensely his profession and was fully committed towards it.

'He has made us proud. The whole family misses him dearly.'
