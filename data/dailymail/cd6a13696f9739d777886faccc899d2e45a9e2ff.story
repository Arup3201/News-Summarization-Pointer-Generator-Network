The French rugby federation is looking for candidates to replace France coach Philippe Saint-Andre following the World Cup.

Since taking over from Marc Lievremont, who led France to the World Cup final in 2011, Saint-Andre has failed to impose himself, winning only 15 of his 37 games in charge. 

He has overseen poor results in the Six Nations, finishing no higher than fourth and even last in 2013.

Saint-Andre has struggled as head coach of Les Bleus winning just 15 of his 37 games in charge 

Saint-Andre will remain in charge for the World Cup in England from September 18 to October 31. 

The FFR launched the application process to find his replacement on Friday, with candidates having until April 25 to declare their bid.

Among the favorites to land the job are Begles-Bordeaux coach Rapahael Ibanez, former Montpellier manager Fabien Galthie and long-time Toulouse coach Guy Noves.
