Sick: Humberto Salvador, 36, has been found guilty of raping a woman because she was a lesbian

A man has been convicted after he raped a woman for being a lesbian, asking ‘you like men now, don’t you?’ as he assaulted her.

The
 33-year-old victim, who has not been identified, wiped away tears as 
she testified about the brutal 2008 gang-rape during the trial of 
Humberto Salvador, 36, in Contra Costa County, California.

She
 recounted the terrifying moment she was robbed, forced to strip naked, 
carjacked and passed between men - an attack prosecutors claim 
stemmed from her sexuality.

'You like men now, don't you? Tell me you like men,' Salvador uttered after he started attacking her, the woman said.

She explained that she screamed 'yes' as she feared for her life.

Salvador has been convicted of 15 felonies including kidnapping, carjacking and gang rape in the December 13, 2008 attack.

Salvador did not react when he was convicted, except to glance at his crying mother.

Police
 have said the rape served as a turning point for people in the 
community to come forward to them and help prevent gang violence in the 
area.

‘I think the case really galvanized people into the idea that enough is enough,’ Richmond police Chief Chris Magnus told the Contra Costa Times.

‘It
 really touched a lot of people, and I think as awful as that crime was,
 there was a positive that came out of it, and that's a sense that a 
community can come together to not only provide tips but also to rally 
behind a victim in need of support.

He was joined that night by fellow gang members Josue Gonzalez - the only one not accused of sexual assault - and Darrell Hodges. A third member, Robert Ortiz, is also alleged to have been present.

Defence lawyers said during the trial that, while 
there was no doubt the rape occurred, they were seeking to prove that
 it was not motivated by the woman's sexual orientation.

In court, the victim described how she arrived home in Richmond from her job at a pizzeria around 9.30pm when she was approached by a man, who demanded her purse and keys.

Photos of the woman's car show it was 
marked with emblems of her sexuality, including rainbow stickers 
symbolising gay pride and a rainbow-colored teddy bear on the dashboard.

She said that Salvador then smashed her across the head with a flashlight and showed 
the jury the scar that is still visible beneath her short hair.

As jurors wiped away their tears, the woman testified that the man forced her to strip naked on the sidewalk.

'He kept insisting and asking whether or not I liked men,' she said through a Spanish interpreter, adding: 'I thought he would kill me.'

He proceeded to rape her until the other men warned that people might be coming. They got into her car where Salvador continued to assault her, she said.

They drove to an abandoned apartment building near the Richmond BART and, after he was done, he turned to the other men and told them it was their turn, the victim said.

Hodges, 20, was sentenced to 24 years in prison earlier this month after admitting to forcible oral copulation. Ortiz, meanwhile, is awaiting trial. Gonzalez, 26, is awaiting sentence after he pleaded guilty to carjacking.

After the attack, the victim testified
 that she was left naked in a carport and waited until they were gone before running to the closest house with a light on. The residents called 911.

The prosecutor said Salvador's semen was recovered from the victim's body and his palm print was found in the victim's blood on the flashlight.

Salvador is to be sentenced on February 21.
