A husband was forced to give his dying wife CPR because a lone paramedic sent to the scene could not manage on her own, it was claimed today.

Alfred Pearce, 65, and his daughter Tracey, 40, battled in vain to save Beryl Pearce after being asked by the first responder to help while she unpacked her equipment and called for back-up.

The pair say they had to take it in turns giving mouth-to-mouth and chest compressions in a desperate eight-minute bid to revive their loved one.

Traumatic last memories: Alfred Pearce was forced to give his dying wife Beryl CPR after she collapsed at their home because the first medic on scene wasn't able to give CPR without their help, it was claimed

A back-up ambulance eventually arrived
 20 minutes later, but Mrs Pearce could not be saved and died of heart 
failure at the scene.

Retired
 builder Mr Pearce says his family has been deeply scarred by the 
horrific events and wants assurances no other families will have to 
suffer due to staff shortages.

He
 said: 'I want things to change so another family doesn’t have to go 
through this. The paramedics were all very nice but my daughter and I 
were so upset and stressed by what happened.

'My
 daughter says she just can’t shake off the image of my wife - her own 
mother - lying there and us getting so distressed trying to save her.'

Dignified: Mr Pearce says he doesn't blame the apologetic paramedic for the position she found herself in

He added: 'I have to be strong for my family but I still suffer flashbacks of me fighting to keep her alive on the living room floor.

'We should not have had to do that. They should have had enough staff to take over. When you call 999 that is what you expect.'

Mrs Pearce, 64, had suffered breathing problems at the couple’s home in Basildon, Essex.

Her husband dialled 999 immediately, but was shocked when a female responder arrived in an ambulance alone.

He said: 'When the paramedic first arrived, she wanted to move my wife into the ambulance to get some fluids into her. But just as we tried to move her from the hallway my wife collapsed and I knew it was serious.

'We couldn’t get her to the ambulance so we moved her in the living room so there was space for all the portable ambulance equipment.

Angry: Mr Pearce is now demanding that the NHS makes drastic changes to its policy to ensure paramedics don't attend emergencies on their own

'Then the paramedic asked my daughter and I to give Beryl CPR while she got her equipment ready. My daughter started the CPR while I held my wife’s head so she didn’t swallow her tongue.

'The paramedic was talking us through what to do and just kept saying "sorry about this".

'I felt sorry for her as she had tears in her eyes and she was shouting "code red" into her radio but no back up was coming. After a while, my daughter got so tired and upset I had to take over.

'I was thinking "Am I doing this right? I might not be pushing hard enough as I’d never done it before".

'Eventually two more ambulance men arrived and took over. It was probably only about eight minutes but it felt like hours.'

Mr Pearce had been married to his childhood sweetheart for 44 years after the pair met for the first time aged 15.

His wife had suffered from a long history of medical problems including heart failures, diabetes and asthma and was known to staff at nearby Basildon Hospital.

Mr Pearce is now calling for a drastic overhaul of NHS policy to stop paramedics travelling alone to call-outs.

Childhood sweethearts: Mr and Mrs Pearce when they were first going out in the 1960s. They had been married for 44 years

The father-of-four and grandfather-of-ten added: 'I’m not saying that if they had sent two people the first time the outcome would have been different but at least they both would have been able to work on her.

'I’ve no qualms with the NHS as Beryl has been brought back from the dead twice by amazing work from doctors and nurses. It’s just upsetting to know my last memories of my wife are so traumatic.'

A spokesperson for the East of England Ambulance Service said: 'It is normal practice for all ambulance services to dispatch highly skilled solo responders if they are closest to assess the patient and get immediate life support to them more quickly while another crew is sent for hospital transport and support.

'It is absolutely not true that a clinician cannot administer CPR on their own. The very reason why they are dispatched on their own is in order to administer CPR and other basic life-support to the patient in the quickest possible time as using solo responders means getting a trained clinician with full equipment by a patient's side quicker.

'There may however be times when it is in the patient's best interests for a paramedic to utilise those on scene to help with basic life support under their instruction while, for example, they are unpacking equipment or calling for assistance. Although this reason may not have been communicated to Mr Pearce.

'This of course does not mean they are not capable of carrying out all these tasks, simply that it makes sense to use support under careful instruction and guidance if it is available, although our staff would always respect someone’s decision not to get involved.'

'Our thoughts are with Mr Pearce and his family. We would be happy to discuss this further with him if he would like to contact us.'

No-one was available at the service today to explain why the paramedic was unable to give CPR on her own.

Mrs Pearce collapsed after the couple had returned from an over-60s Diamond Jubilee Party at around 6pm on Sunday, June 3.
