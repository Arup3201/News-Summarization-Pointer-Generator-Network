A traditional Italian nonna swapped her love of pasta 20 years ago for exercise and healthy living and is now a professional runner who has even won a body-sculpting competition.

From down and out housewife to sizzling hot Super Gran, Paula Moorhouse, used a horrible insult made about her image to become the person she could never have dreamed to be. 

In her mid 40s, the mother-of-four was going through menopause and her self-esteem was at an all-time low when her partner at the time called her a 'barge a**'.

The 66-year-old, from Sydney, used the remark as motivation to turn her life around and she now goes to the gym for an hour and a half every morning, before heading out to clean a couple of houses for a living. 

No time for nanna naps, the sexy Sexagenarian then hits the running track to train in the afternoon before finishing off her action-packed day by whipping her clients into shape during her personal training sessions.

Forty years ago - Paula swapped her love of pasta (left) and all things Italian for a passion for exercise (right)

A traditional housewife - Paula decided to do something for herself and even won a body-sculpting competition

Weighing 61kg in her old life, Paula was hardly a large woman in the past - now seven kilos lighter - it is more about her frame of mind and outlook on life.

'It's weird how a statement like that can set you off but I probably needed it to take a look at myself to get motivated and change a few things,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'You've got to do things for yourself instead of being at home and being a house mum - looking after teenage kids who can really look after themselves.'

Paula successfully rose above the repressed situation that she was living in with her partner 20 years ago.

'I had a partner who kept putting me down and telling me I would never amount to anything - if you hear that often enough you do tend to believe it,' she said. 

The snide comment was enough for her to become an avid gym-goer where she started back to back aerobics classes but with no results.

Paula says she feels 16 and dresses like she's 20: 'I like the way I look and I feel good - life is great'

'A personal trainer told me I needed to do resistance work and weights and change my diet,' she said.

'I became hooked because I could see the results.'

Although Paula didn't loss crazy kilos - she did drop from a size 12 down to a 6. 

As a true-to-form Italian Nonna, carbohydrates were Paula's best friend but it wasn't long before not even one potato chip (her biggest love) would pass her lips.

'I stopped fatty foods and frying everything,' she said. 

'I have a non-stick pan and cook stir fries or cook things in the oven.'

Reducing her alcohol intake was another big lifestyle change that paid off volumes. 

'I used to have a couple of drinks every night while cooking dinner but it's just unwanted calories so now I just drink socially.'

A born and bred Queenslander, she packed up her life at 58 years old and drove to Sydney - and has never looked back.

'I had spent 30 years dependent on two different men and did not want to then be dependent on my children,' she said.

'We are all creatures of habit but what is the worst that can happen? If you hate it do something else.'

She may have given up her Italian food - but Paula is still a true doting Nonna to grandaughter Charlotte

The Moorhouse family used to eat 'man-size' meals as children before Paula adapted to a healthier lifestyle

Running very quickly became Paula's passion and she has the achievements to prove it: setting a new age group in the Australian 800m indoor record and being part of the team that broke the world record for the 4 x 800m.

When Paula injured herself and wasn't allowed to run for three months instead of kicking back on the sofa - she decided become a body-sculptor and even won a competition.

Her two daughters, Mirella, 38, and and Susan, 35, have been on a few gruelling training sessions with their mother who has put them to shame.

'I won't be training with her again,' Mirella laughed. 

'The more she pushed the less I tried - we ended up arguing.'

Her daughters have asked their mum to wear 'age-appropriate' clothing but to no avail.

'I feel like I'm 16 and dress like I'm 20,' Paula said. 

'I like low cut dresses that go to the middle of the thigh but it has to be done tastefully.

'I've got to be me - I don't want to be anyone else.' 

So, will the super fit Nonna still be running in 20 years time? 

'I give myself ten years - there is no way I want to be one of those women in their 80s who is clapped and lapped,' she said. 

'I don't want to be hurried to get over the line - I want to go out in a blaze of glory.' 

Paula's sons were embarrassed to see her body-sculpting photos and her mates thought she was 'hot'

However, Paula's four children are very inspired by their mother's motivation saying she is a great role model

But this doesn't mean that her girls don't see their mother as an amazing influence in their lives.

'We used to have man-size meals growing up so we she first started changing her lifestyle we didn't think she would stick to it but she did,' Mirella said.

'She always inspires us and is definitely a good role model.'  

Paula may have curbed her Italian ways with food but she is still a doting Nonna to Susan's five month old daughter Charlotte.

Her sons, Christopher and Stephen, used to get embarrassed because their friends would comment on how 'hot' their mother looked.

'I would send them my body-sculpting competition photos and they would say they don't want to see them because I'm in underwear on stage with young men looking at me,' she laughed. 

'I like the way I look and I feel good - I never get sick - life is great.'  

Paula succeeded in rising above the repressed situation that she was living in with her partner 20 years ago
