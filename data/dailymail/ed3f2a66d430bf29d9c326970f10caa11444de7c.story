The wife of a Florida police officer has been arrested for allegedly running a prostitution ring from two apartments in Boca Raton.

Denise McCoy, 34, and her apparent business partner Sara Marin, 42, were charged with pimping and money-laundering on Tuesday and are being held in the Palm Beach County jail.

McCoy's husband, Samuel McCoy, has been put on paid administration leave following the prostitution bust, according to Boca Police Chief Dan Alexander, though he hasn't been arrested.

'It's very early (in the investigation),' Alexander told the Sun Sentinel.

According to the newspaper, a Brazilian sex worker helped police unearth the local prostitution ring.

She told detectives the two women pimped her out for nine months after insisting that no sex would be involved when they offered her the job.

When one of the male clients demanded intercourse, the woman refused but she said Denise McCoy threatened to have her jailed as an illegal immigrant if she didn't comply.

According to the unnamed woman's affidavit, Denise McCoy and Marin advertised several girls using online classified website, Backpage.com.

She said the women arranged for the girls to have sex with johns at apartments at 22312 Calibre Court and 22042 Boca Place Drive in two shifts from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and 5 p.m. to 1 a.m.

The clients paid $200 per hour plus tips to the hookers who split the cash evenly with McCoy and Marin.

According to the Sun Sentinel, the woman
told police she worked six days a week, having sex with anywhere from 
six to 12 men each day.

Using the tip, police set up surveillance at both apartments over several months and reported seeing women entering the apartments for long periods, followed by a stream of men who spent 10 minutes to 1 hour inside.

The police also went undercover, with a Boca Raton Police investigator paying $200 for McCoy to masturbate for 10 to 15 minutes, the Sun Sentinel reported. In another operation, a sergeant paid $150 for oral sex and intercourse with Marin, but created a 'ruse' in order to leave.

Surveillance officers spotted the women 
handing something to Denise McCoy, who then drove to a Bank of America 
ATM, or to a Boynton Beach home where police say Marin lived. Several johns admitted paying for sex acts in the 
apartments when they were cornered by police as they left.

Boca police subpoenaed bank records for Denise McCoy, and found 62 cash deposits totaling $29,640.38 between March and November 2012.

The Sun Sentential reported that Marin's bank records for three accounts showed deposits totaling $40,779, $36,940, $35,885 and $11,723 between January and September 2012. Some of the money apparently moved between Marin's accounts.

This isn't the first time Samuel McCoy, 31, has been suspended from his police job. He was put on leave twice in 2011, according to the Sun Sentinel.

In April, he was suspended for 36 hours after he was caught taking pictures of his genital area while on duty.

McCoy said he had a medical condition that he needed to document and insisted he said he never sent the photos to anyone and they were deleted.

In July 2011, he was suspended for 84 hours for looking at pornography on his work computer. He said he was looking for jujitsu videos online and clicked on other links that 'piqued my interest,' according to the newspaper.

That investigation was prompted by a city official who found out that Samuel McCoy was part of an adult social networking site for swingers.

The mayor of Boca Raton, Susan Whelchel, told WPTV.com that no one has indicated officer McCoy was involved in the alleged prostitution ring.Â 

'The investigation will prove whatever it proves and if he had absolutely nothing to do with this then he's a fine person and he will continue,' she said.
