A Canadian mayor caught up in a scandal over a video purportedly showing him smoking crack cocaine has fired his chief of staff.

Toronto Mayor Rob Ford dismissed Mark Towhey yesterday and gave no reason for his sacking. 

It comes as the mayor faces increasing pressure over the alleged crack smoking video.

Reports on the gossip website Gawker
and in the Toronto Star claimed it was taken by men who said they had 
sold the drug to Ford.

The Star reported that two 
journalists had watched a video that appears to show Ford, sitting in a 
chair, inhaling from what appears to be a glass crack pipe.

Gawker and the Star said the video was shown to them by a drug dealer who had been trying to sell it for a six-figure sum.

City Councilor Jaye Robinson said she was told Towhey's firing was unrelated to the scandal, but rather had something to do with football.

Ford was fired as coach of a 
Catholic high school football team on Wednesday - a development school 
officials also denied was related to the scandal. 

Toronto
Catholic District School Board spokesman John Yan said the decision to 
remove Ford as the head of Don Bosco Eagles Football program on 
Wednesday had to do with the comments the mayor made to the Sun TV 
Network in March that parents found offensive.

Ford has been ducking the media and his only comments on the scandal came last Friday, a day after the story broke, when he called the crack smoking allegations 'ridiculous' and said that the Toronto Star was out to get him.

Ford has been embroiled in almost weekly controversies about his behavior since being elected in 2010, but the crack video allegations are the most serious allegations he's faced yet.

The Star also reported that in the video Ford allegedly made a racist remark about high school football students he coached.

The video has not been released publicly and it's authenticity has not been verified.

Last week, Ford's lawyer, Dennis Morris, told the Toronto Sun that the mayor is denying 'any such allegation.'

'We're just trying to see whether or not such a video exists and whether or not any video has been doctored or altered,' Morris told the Toronto Sun.

Ford, who is no stranger to controversy, was elected mayor of Toronto more than two years ago after serving as a Councillor for 10 years.
