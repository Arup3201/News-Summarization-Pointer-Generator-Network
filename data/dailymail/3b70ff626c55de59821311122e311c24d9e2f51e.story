Midfielder Ricky Centurion scored the only goal of the game four minutes after the break to ensure Racing could not be caught by title rivals River Plate. 

River led the way for most of the campaign but blew their lead in the run-in as Racing capitalised to snatch the championship from under their noses. 

Racing coach Diego Cocca said: 'I'm overjoyed because we had tough times  but this team were very brave to pull through.'
