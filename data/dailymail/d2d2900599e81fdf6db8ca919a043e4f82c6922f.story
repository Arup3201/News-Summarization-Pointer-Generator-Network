A poignant image of a mother cuddling her three-year-old son with cancer has touched hearts all over the world.

Ariane Grabill's husband Zach took the photo of her and little Aiden last year after he had a kidney removed and underwent gruelling chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

But now Aiden has turned five and is free of cancer - while the image of his mother's love has inspired tens of thousands of parents in the same position.

A mother's love: This poignant image of Ariane Grabill cuddling her three-year-old son with kidney cancer has gone viral on Facebook, touching hearts all over the world. Aiden is now five, with a clean bill of health

Aiden was diagnosed in March last year with Wilms' tumour, a cancer which develops in a child's kidneys while they are still in the womb.

By the time doctors caught the disease, the skinny three-year-old had a tumour weighing 2lbs and had to have his right kidney removed.

Then it was up to medics to put him through intensive treatments of chemotherapy and radiotherapy which come with a long list of side effects even for the healthiest adults, let alone children.

The treatment ended in October last year and since the Aiden's scans have been clear, to the joy of his parents.

He turned five last Wednesday - prompting birthday messages from all over the world - and is due for his next check-up next week.

When the treatment was at its most 
intense, the family from Midlothian, Virginia, visited Boca Grande in 
Florida where the photo was taken.

Feeling better: Aiden as he is now, left, and right with his mother Ariane, father Zach and sister Caroline. Mrs Grabill said: 'If you didn't know Aiden had been sick you'd never know it now. He's just a happy five-year-old boy'

Accompanied by their daughter Caroline, now nine, Mrs Grabill posed up as Mr Grabill, a 38-year-old attorney, took the now-famous shot.

But it stayed confined to their friends and family until they posted it on the Facebook feed of NBC's Today Show as part of a set on '100 happy days'.

Mrs Grabill, 36, told MailOnline: 'We 
just went on holiday as a family to have a good time in the middle of what we
 were going through.

'This has been mostly a positive 
experience for me. We've come so far in a year and we can say to these 
moms to just take it a day at a time and hang in there for good news'

- Ariane Grabill, Aiden's mother

'I'm 
completely overwhelmed by the response. There are lots of moms who've 
been in the same situation or are currently in it - that's the most 
touching part, knowing how these people feel.

'I know it helped me at the time to know we weren't alone and there is a real community out there.

'This has been mostly a positive experience for me. We've come so far in a year and we can say to these moms to just take it a day at a time and hang in there for good news.'

She added: 'If you didn't know Aiden had been sick you'd never know it now looking at him. He's just a happy five-year-old boy.

'He has no idea he's inspired so many people. He doesn't remember a lot which is good for him, but we remember every day.'

Along with birthday wishes for Aiden, Facebook was flooded with personal messages from families going through the same experience.

Debbie
 Rosen Arky from Encino, California, wrote: 'My cousin, Corey is 
undergoing brain surgery, as I write this, to remove another tumor. They
 said he'd never make it to get married or have kids.

'He's married to a beautiful, very special lady & they have three adorable little girls who love their daddy so much.'

Loving: The family as they are now. Aiden had to have a kidney removed, but so far has been recovering well

Another
 Facebook user, Heather Wing Stallone, wrote: 'This is my sister and 
niece over two years ago. She is now 11 and has been battling 
neuroblastoma for 7 years! This was Laura's first visit to the Atlantic 
Ocean!'

The experience has affected the family deeply, and Mr Grabill is now a board member for the ASK Childhood Cancer Foundation in Richmond, Virginia.

Since the photo garnered more than 60,000 'likes' and messages of thanks from far-flung corners of the globe, they have come up with a theory of why it was so popular.

'I think it helps that you can't really see our faces,' said Mrs Grabill.

'So you just look at it and you can see a mother's love - it's not necessarily my love for him. You can project yourself onto that situation and imagine how it would be for you.'
