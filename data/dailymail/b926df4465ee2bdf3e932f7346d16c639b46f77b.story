If the people in charge of Manchester United were searching for a serene, unruffled, semi-detached figure to be their new manager, then they may have landed the ideal candidate in Louis van Gaal.

Where others might have bawled colourful curses at the inadequacies of this abject United side, Van Gaal remained resolutely undramatic. It was, he said, a ‘very disappointing’ start to the season.

Elsewhere at Old Trafford, more damaging verdicts were being delivered, but we sensed that the new man had shrewd reasons for appearing so reasonable. His inherited team’s performance had spoken for itself. Now the whole world knew that reports of United’s demise had not been exaggerated.

There was no reason to raise his voice when his task was so obvious. And so, he could start work with a clean sheet.

Anything he achieves will be down to his own efforts. After almost a quarter of a century in football management, Van Gaal understands how the politics work.

Throughout the afternoon, he had resisted any temptation to occupy centre stage, almost as if he was disclaiming responsibility for this shambles of a side.

He entered the arena with the very minimum of fuss. Wearing a dark suit and a sombre stare and carrying a clipboard, he resembled a senior accountant on his way to an early lunch. The crowd’s welcome was warm and he acknowledged it with a brief, polite smile.

For the next 45 minutes he did not leave his seat, gazing impassively at the dire, unfolding spectacle. Time was when a United team sheet read like a threatening letter.

Sure they had suffered injuries and untimely absences, but this one looked like the kind of side they used to put out against non-League teams in the early rounds of the FA Cup, when the season was wearing and the stars were weary.

Later, he would attempt to soften the impression his players had made.

‘In the first half, I saw a lot of very nervous players, people making the wrong choices,’ he said. ‘But that’s Manchester United. You have to cope with that pressure.’

Indeed you do, but that happy day is some way off and he seemed to know it all too well. So he sat and stared across at the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand, bearing banners which echoed past glories: ‘European Capital of Trophies’, ‘Sir Alex 26 Years’, and silhouettes of all the trophies which the old chap won.

Downcast: Van Gaal knows there are serious shortcomings with his squad and investment is needed 

He would not have been daunted by such slogans; Sir Alex himself might not have won a speck of silver with a back three of Phil Jones, Chris Smalling and Tyler Blackett. 

A goal down at half time — ‘You’re getting sacked in the morning’, the Swansea singers informed Van Gaal — he walked sedately back to the dressing room, apparently in no great hurry to assault his troops.

In fact, he had decided to jettison his back three in favour of a more conventional four; a conclusion he had reached after some 25 minutes. Half time would be taken up in explaining his expectations.

There were one or two consolations, of course. Ander Herrera, the expensive recruit from Athletic Bilbao, looked smart, quick and thoughtful, while his new captain Wayne Rooney gave his all, since he knows no other way.

Fitting in: Tyler Blackett was pressed into action in the United defence after an injury crisis 

The Rooney decision offered further proof of Van Gaal’s political skills, since it was not so much a masterstroke, more an appointment he would have found it difficult to withhold.

Rooney’s goal, early in the second half, did not rouse his manager to anything resembling emotion.

Instead, Van Gaal frowned gently and scribbled a note on that clipboard. Clearly, the fist-clenching, eye-bulging, ‘show ‘em you’re passionate’ pantomime is not to his taste — for which much thanks.

But there were times when his self-control must have been tested, especially in the 75th minute, when United conceded a goal which owed much to Swansea swift thinking but also reeked of dim-witted defending.

The full implications were now sinking in. He already knew that the place need urgent redecoration, now he realised that the foundations themselves were rotten. He has been required to fight a good many fires in a garlanded career, but this is a rare conflagration.

On the whistle, he took time to leave his seat. He actually signed a good many autographs, then he slapped a few palms as he wandered along the front row of the stands, before shuffling away, still carrying his clipboard.

He tried to put it into perspective. ‘It is not good, because we had built up a lot of confidence and it will be smashed down because of the result’, he said. He praised his team’s ‘fantastic attitude’, the way they had ‘tried their utmost’. Then he reflected, more realistically: ‘But running is not enough. You must also use your brain’.

It was the closest he came to public criticism, and we sensed that he would have felt foolish had he not hinted at his true feelings. ‘I shall tell the players what I think of them’, he muttered and it sounded more like a promise than a mild threat. For there will be changes, many changes at what they still refer to as ‘The Theatre of Dreams’.

And Manchester United have taken the massive gamble that the serene, unruffled fellow with the clipboard is the man to make them.
