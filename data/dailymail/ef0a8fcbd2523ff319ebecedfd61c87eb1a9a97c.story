It's been almost three years since Gordon Wood was acquitted of murdering girlfriend Caroline Byrne but a jury will again be asked to decide whether he's guilty or innocent - this time in a defamation trial.

The body of 24-year-old Ms Byrne, a Sydney model, was found at the bottom of The Gap, in Sydney's east, a notorious suicide spot, on June 8, 1995. 

Mr Wood, a former chauffeur to stockbroker Rene Rivkin, was arrested for his girlfriend's murder in 2006. He was convicted of her murder in November 2008 and spent more than three years in jail before being acquitted in 2012.

While Mr Wood's acquittal seemed to be the closure in a long running case, it will be opened once again, possibly next year.

Mr Wood had launched defamation suits in the NSW Supreme Court against a number of Australian media organisations, including Channel Seven, 2GB and 2UE for alleging he did kill Ms Byrne.

While it's believed those cases have been settled, the defamation matter against Nationwide News - now News Corp Australia - remains and Fairfax News reports the corporation intends to defend the defamation claim itself on the basis that the allegation of murder is true. 

On Friday, NSW Supreme Court Justice Lucy McCallum said the case would, in effect, involve the publisher 're-running the Crown case in the criminal trial', but with a lower standard of proof. 

In September, Justice McCallum ordered a larger jury panel of 12, rather than four, to decide the case.

A preliminary judgement by Justice McCallum said that Mr Wood was seeking to pursue his claims in defamation. 

'The action will involve a retrial of the issue whether he murdered his girlfriend, the difference being that the standard of proof that applies in civil proceedings will apply,' Justice McCallum said.

'The determination of an allegation of murder is one which weighs heavily on those who have to determine it.' 

Justice McCallum also said that the original trial received 'a great deal of media attention' and a larger jury might help 'dilute the influence of any single juror whose passions or antipathies may be aroused for or against one of the parties'.

In court on Friday it was ruled that Mr Wood would have to provide written answers under oath to questions served to him by Nationwide News.

The trial date is expected to be set next year. The length of the trial is estimated to be about eight weeks.
