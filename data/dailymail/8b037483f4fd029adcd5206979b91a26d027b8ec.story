Power giants and airlines were warned last night to pass on plummeting fuel prices to families or face Government sanctions.

George Osborne insisted they should quickly follow the lead of petrol retailers and slash their charges.

The wholesale price of gas has plunged almost 30 per cent in a year while crude oil has more than halved in six months. A barrel cost just $53 last night – the lowest level in five years.

George Osborne has started a Government investigation into whether key sectors such as utilities are reducing consumer bills with Brent crude trading at just 52 US dollars a barrel

The Chancellor insisted it was ‘vital this was passed on to families at petrol pumps, through utility bills and air fares’.

‘The Government is conducting studies of industries like the utilities and the airlines. We are examining if any action needs to be taken,’ a Treasury spokesman said.

A source said ministers would be watching utility companies and airlines closely to ensure they cut prices. 

‘Consumers could feel the benefit in many other ways if the fall in oil and gas price was passed on to final product,’ one official said.

‘We’re going to be watching them like a hawk. So far this has worked with fuel prices. Pump prices are coming down. We believe it can work with other industries.’

Asda announced a 2p cut in its petrol price this week with a new maximum charge of 107.7p a litre. Other supermarkets have followed suit and experts say petrol prices are heading below £1 a litre.

Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander wrote to fuel suppliers and distributors late last year demanding they pass on falling oil prices to customers or face action.

Oil price: Brent crude has fallen to levels not seen for more than five years

A source close to him said last night: ‘Anybody involved in the supply of energy in terms of petrol, diesel, domestic heating, air fares and domestic gas and electricity must make sure they are passing on the reductions in full.

‘And they must be in no doubt that they should do it very quickly.’ Ed Davey, the Energy Secretary, told LBC Radio: ‘It is vital we get the fall in oil and gas prices through to consumers. I am glad the Treasury is now looking at this.’

Ministers hope lower bills will undermine Labour leader Ed Miliband’s proposal to introduce a 20-month energy price freeze if he wins power in May.

Such a move would make it impossible for firms to pass on the benefits of falling wholesale prices.

Npower said fears over Labour’s planned freeze was a reason they were not cutting prices.

Danny Alexander said the fall in oil prices was a benefit to 'most of the UK economy' - provided savings are passed on

Industry regulator Ofgem last month accused the ‘Big Six’ energy firms of failing customers for not passing on oil and gas price cuts.

Its chief executive Dermot Nolan said at least two firms should have slashed prices by now, adding: ‘I am concerned about this and about the lack of competition this would appear to show.’

But British Gas, the UK’s biggest energy firm, defended its decision not cut bills. A spokesman said: ‘We buy our gas well in advance – up to three years in some cases – to ensure security of supply and to smooth out price volatility, so movements in wholesale prices do not feed through immediately to retail prices.

‘The wholesale cost of energy is now less than half the bill – we have other costs that are rising such as network costs, which have risen 40 per cent in seven years.

‘We are certainly not increasing profits on the back of lower wholesale gas prices. Our July 2014 half-year results showed a 26 per cent fall in pre-tax profits.’

Virgin Atlantic cut fuel surcharges by £10 on its long-haul flights last month, but other firms, including British Airways, have not followed suit.

The Treasury has written to the bosses of all the major British airlines insisting they should pass on fuel price savings to consumers by cutting surcharges or reducing ticket prices.

Mr Alexander said: ‘Airline ticket prices appear not to be falling as significantly as customers might expect given the very significant fall in oil prices.’
