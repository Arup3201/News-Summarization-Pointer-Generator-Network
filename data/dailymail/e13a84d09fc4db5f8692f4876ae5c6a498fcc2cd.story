A school that was made famous in the film Gregory's Girl is being flattened by demolition crews, despite a desperate campaign to keep it open.

Bulldozers today began tearing down Abronhill High in Cumbernauld, Lanarkshire, where  the 1981 Bill Forsyth film was shot.

The work - expected to last one week - comes after parents and campaigners threatened to take legal action in a bid to keep the school open.

Bulldozers have started tearing down Abronhill High in Cumbernauld, Lanarkshire, where they filmed the 1981 comedy Gregory's Girl 

The work - expected to last a week - comes after parents and campaigners threatened to take court action in a bid to keep the school open

A group, who claimed the authority had not fulfilled its obligation under school closure legislation, raised around £5,500 to start a case against North Lanarkshire Council.

But, after taking legal advice about their chances of successfully challenging the decision, the Save Abronhill High group announced in December that its campaign was at an end.

Six months earlier, Scottish Ministers had rubber-stamped the local authority's decision to close the school, amid plans for a merger with another school in the area.

Many of the scenes for Gregory's Girl were filmed at Abronhill High, a school which opened in 1978.

The comedy starred John Gordon Sinclair as Gregory, Dee Hepburn as Dorothy and Clare Grogan as Susan. 

Kat Drummond, 48, a psychiatric nurse whose brother Paul, 51, was an extra in the film said: 'I'm very sad to see it go, I've been in tears about it.

'It's just not right, a bit of history is going and it was the heart of this community and will have a knock on effect, especially on the shops who relied on the kids spending money there.

'I was in the campaign to keep the school and was very vocal. We did everything we could and fought a long hard fight but unfortunately it wasn't meant to be.'  

She added: 'The campaign pulled the whole of Abronhill together and we fought a long hard campaign and didn't take it lying down.

'My brother was an extra in the film, he was in the cooling scene up the back washing dishes. 

Gregory's Girl is a 1981 Scottish coming-of-age romantic comedy film written and directed by Bill Forsyth 

Many of the scenes  were filmed at the school, including in the corridors and classrooms 

'I watched it being filmed and it was a great laugh, I'm just so sad to see it go.' 

Last year, North Lanarkshire's learning and leisure services committee approved the merger of Abronhill and Cumbernauld High Schools.

The council said the decision addressed the decreasing school roll and would create £1.3 million for the schools.

Under the plan, there is due to be a new purpose-built school to replace both campuses.

However, parents immediately appealed the decision to the Scottish Government, which called it in for review.

The campaign group was given a glimmer of hope when the government informed the authority that it had concerns over the educational benefit of the proposed closure, suggesting the merger move may 'lack clarity'.

But, ministers approved the council's decision in June, with a number of conditions covering aspects such as funding, the timetable for change and pupil safety issues.

Demolition crews have already removed the front of the building, allowing passers-by to see the inside of the classrooms.

Meanwhile, a large digger is clearing up piles of rubble which were on the ground.
