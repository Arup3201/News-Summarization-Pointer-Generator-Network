A benefits ‘parasite’ who pretended he needed a wheelchair as he conned his way to a millionaire lifestyle was yesterday ordered to stand in the dock as he was  jailed for eight years.

Barry Brooks, who insisted on being known as ‘Sir Barry’ and claimed he could barely walk, falsely claimed £1.8million after setting up a sham business pretending he was helping disabled people get work.

Instead, the 49-year-old and his lover and co-director Derek Arnold, 55, spent the money on a portfolio of properties, top-of-the-range cars and holidays.

'Sir Barry': Brooks, 49, claimed he was unable to climb stairs, had to use an electric wheelchair and could not lift anything heavier than a sandwich yet was able to play in a swimming pool while holidaying in Gran Canaria

Devious: Brooks set up a business aimed at helping get disabled people into work entitling him to receive grants. He then siphoned off cash into his own accounts

Extravagant: Brooks was put under surveillance in 2009 and a search of his Bromley house revealed photographs of him diving around a wreck in Gran Canaria

Their deceit was exposed after 
investigators raided their house in Bromley, Kent, and found photos 
showing Brooks scuba-diving around a wreck in Gran Canaria, dive-bombing
into a swimming pool and riding a motorbike.

Yesterday Brooks arrived at court in a
wheelchair but, after he was warned by Judge Martin Beddoe that he 
could be found in contempt of court for persisting with the ‘charade’, 
he walked to the dock with the help of a frame.

Lies: There were also photographs of him riding a powerful Suzuki motorbike unaided

Able bodied: Brooks claimed he would wear a support called a reciprocating gait orthosis which enabled him to walk, but nothing of the sort was found at his home

Lover: The monthly claims made on behalf of Brooks' company were submitted by Derek Arnold, 55, named as a co-director and who described himself as Brooks's 'sexual playmate'

The judge jailed both men for eight years
for conspiracy to defraud and fraud in a ‘brazen and entirely 
parasitical’ con based on a belief ‘the system was a cow to be milked’.

Brooks claimed he had to use a 
wheelchair and could not lift anything heavier than a sandwich, 
Southwark Crown Court was told.

But medical experts concluded he was 
‘malingering’ and making up his disabilities.

Investigators discovered he was using 
grants of £29,000 a month to buy five properties in the UK as well as a 
penthouse apartment in Spain.

The pair set up a firm called Access 
Audit Corporation in 2004 purporting to provide training and advice to 
disabled people.

Brooks claimed £1million through the Access to Work 
scheme for taxis, support and equipment.

He even put in daily taxi fare 
claims while he was holidaying in Thailand and the Canary Islands.

In addition, the men received £880,000
in grants for finding work for ‘clients’ the scheme purported to employ
in a ‘cynical fraud’ against the Department for Work and Pensions. 

There is ‘no evidence’ the scheme ever employed anyone, the court heard.

The men’s home was raided after suspicions were raised in 2009.

Among the items found were three 
Jaguars plus an Audi cabriolet, a Mini and a Range Rover, Suzuki 
motorbikes and £50,000 in cash.

Brooks had also planned to ‘build an 
empire’ of UK offices, as well as buy a country house, Duncraig Castle 
in Scotland and property in the Caribbean and Florida.

A third man, Stephen Isaac, 54, of 
Cardiff, who pretended to be an employee so they could claim £300,000 on
the grounds his feet had been severed and grafted back on, was jailed 
for two and a half years after admitting conspiracy to defraud.
