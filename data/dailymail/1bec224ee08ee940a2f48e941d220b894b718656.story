Four-time Winter Olympian and five-time British champion alpine skier Chemmy Alcott, who retired from competition at the end of the 2014 season, on rivalling Serena Williams, starring as a Bond girl, Muhammad Ali and how finishing 19th at Sochi was like winning gold.

WHO IS YOUR SPORTING HERO? 

Muhammad Ali. He was incredible. Skiing is quite an aggressive sport and so is boxing, but he carried himself so well.

Chemmy Alcott, the recently retired British alpine skier, says her sporting hero is Muhammad Ali 

WHAT WOULD YOU BE IF YOU WEREN'T A SPORTSWOMAN?

It’s always been sport for me but if I wasn’t a skier I would have been a tennis player. I was a power hitter and could have done well in the era of Serena Williams!

WHICH OTHER SPORTS STAR WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE?

I’d love to have something like the mobot so I’d have to say Mo Farah.

Chemmy likes the idea of having her own signature, such as Mo Farah's famous 'Mobot'

CAREER HIGHLIGHT?

Finishing 19th in Sochi six months after I broke my leg. I had 1,048 minutes of surgery so to finish within two seconds of the leader was like gold for me.

... AND THE WORST MOMENT?

The crashes. You can’t ski in ignorance of injury but they do define you. I fought back and became a positive person.

IF YOUR HOUSE WAS BURNING DOWN, WHAT ONE POSSESSION WOULD YOU SAVE? 

Probably photographs of my mum. She passed away in 2006 but is still a really important person in my life. I wear her engagement ring to carry her with me. So those and maybe my coffee machine!

FAVOURITE KARAOKE SONG?  

Can’t Take My Eyes Off You. I like the Andy Williams version but I always think of Heath Ledger singing it in 10 Things I Hate About You.

THREE MOST-LISTENED TO SONG ON YOUR IPOD?  

Lady Gaga — Edge of Glory, Vampire Weekend — Diane Young, and anything by Fleetwood Mac. 

Edge of Glory was my pre-race pump-up song and in my retirement race - when I was supposed to ski slowly - it was played on the PA. I won by two seconds. They should have stuck to classical.

LAST FILM YOU SAW? 

Rising from the Ashes — a great documentary about the Rwanda cycling team.

LAST BOOK YOU READ?

I’m reading Unbroken. It’s about Louis Zamperini, a survivor from a prisoner of war camp in the Second World War.

When it comes to music, Alcott is a big Lady gaga, Vampire Weekend and Fleetwood Mac fan

WHICH THREE PEOPLE WOULD YOU INVITE TO A DINNER PARTY AND WHY? 

Madonna - she would have the most incredible stories. Part of me would say someone like Hitler! But then I think Muhammad Ali to talk and offer security.

YOUR FAVOURITE HOLIDAY DESTINATION?

Maui in terms of indulgence but I’ve got an amazing relationship with Africa. That’s where my honeymoon was and where I’ve done a lot of charity work.

IN A FILM OF YOUR LIFE, WHO WOULD YOU LIKE TO PLAY YOU?  

Blake Lively. I’ve got a massive girl-crush on her. But I’d do the stunts. I’ve always felt I could do a job as a Bond girl if they ever need one for a skiing scene…

Chemmy's girl crush is Blake Lively, and the skier thinks she'd be handy on a Bond film set

TELL US A SECRET... 

I’m the world-record holder for beer-mat flipping. I took on Pat Rafter and did 30 in 30 seconds so I’m in the Guinness Book of World Records.
