Gazing into each other’s eyes, Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown sway on the dancefloor as they celebrate their wedding in a haunting video that only serves to highlight just how tragic their union was to become.

It is footage that will be both difficult and inspiring for daughter Bobbi Kristina to watch as she admits she is still struggling to 
recover from her mother's death in a revealing interview with feted 
documentary maker Daphne Barak, who unearthed the video.

As Whitney the bride regally embraces a line of children at the ceremony, all dressed in white and playing classical music with small violins, Bobbi, now 20 and married only weeks ago, tells Daphne: ‘She WAS royal. People don’t know that about her…I called her My Royal Woman’.

Newlyweds: Whitney Houston and Bobbi Brown beam after tying to knot on July 18, 1992. The marriage was to end in 2006 and Whitney was to die after years of drug abuse on February 11, 2012

Indeed, as they croon to each other at
 the lavish wedding on July 18, 1992, Whitney and Bobby - who were very 
much considered music's odd couple at the time - look every inch 
royalty, with Bobby even teasingly wearing one Whitney’s earrings.

The
 wedding, held at Whitney’s $10million home in Mendham, New Jersey, was 
an excessive affair, attended by a guest list of 800 – a figure Brown 
was later to sigh was ‘too much'.

Both
 the bride and groom wore white, with Whitney’s dress created out of 
French lace by Mark Bouwer and costing $40,000, and the wedding party 
dressed  in shades of purple, the star’s favourite colour.

It
 is all a far cry from the circumstances of how Whitney’s life would end
 on February 11, 2012, after she was found dead in a bathtub at The 
Beverly Hilton hotel in Los Angeles, aged just 48.

The couple had divorced in 2006 following a fiery and very public marriage.

Since
 the death of Whitney, one of the world’s biggest singing stars in her 
heyday before she spiralled into a desperate addiction to crack cocaine,
 Bobbi now has only her memories of her beloved mother to cling on to.

Now
 living in Atlanta with her husband and De facto step-brother Nick 
Gordon, Bobbi makes it clear that both she and Nick considered Whitney their mom, insisting: ‘Our mom was royal.'

While Nick, 24, whom Whitney moved into her home about 10 years before her death after learning his mother could no longer care for him, tells Daphne: ‘She was my
 mom too!’

Confirming their marriage earlier this
 month, Bobbi - who has said Whitney would have wanted their union - 
adds: ‘Our mom taught us to be royal. We are different.

‘There
 is royalty in our veins. She taught us how to move, how to talk. We 
want you to know, that where we come front, WE are royals, because SHE 
was royal.’

'In love': Bobbi Kristina Brown and husband Nick Gordon step out in Georgia on January 10. They said their marriage is what Whitney would have wanted

Left with this 
memento of one of the happiest days of her parents’ lives, Bobbi 
reveals: ‘I was there…she was pregnant with me, but she didn’t know. 
They found out about me during their honeymoon.’

Speaking about her parents' wedding, Bobbi adds: ‘I love her dress, and the headpiece, the 
matching earrings…Mom is beautiful. You see, you picked it up, how royal
 she was.’

‘She used to call
 me ‘Stina,’ Bobbi tells Daphne as it becomes clear that time is not helping the grief-stricken daughter: ‘I miss her like hell. She 
taught me everything. Now I’m working on my career, but also on myself.

‘I’m working on learning how to be a woman without the woman who taught me to be a woman.’

Referring
 to the star she also called ‘Lioness’ because of her Leo birth sign, 
Bobbi says the upcoming anniversary of her mother’s death makes her 
realise just how much people did not really know Whitney.

‘People did not know her’, she tells Daphne: ‘They write things. But for me, she wasn’t Whitney Houston.'

Dedicated
 to embarking on a music career like her mother, she says: ‘I am the 
only one who can sing her songs like she did. She always said that if 
they would make a film about her, only I could play her.

‘She
 taught me how to sing Acapella. She taught me that singing Acapella 
would make my voice stronger and stronger. She taught me Gospel, she 
taught me for 18 years how to be royal, how to be her daughter, a 
woman…I am very proud of her.’

On the video, images of the reception filled with candles and 
lavender and white orchid arrangements alongside an 18-layer cake flash up 
on screen, as A-list guests ranging from Donald Trump 
to Whitney’s aunt Dionne Warwick and even P Diddy, can be seen sipping Cristal and 
Dom Perignon champagne.

Royalty: Bobbi Kristina Brown says her mom Whitney brought her and Nick up to believe they were royal - adding: 'She always said that if they would make a film about her, only I could play her'

Heartbroken: Bobbi Kristina Brown says: 'I called my mom my Royal Woman'. She's seen here with her parents in New York in 1994

Stooping to thank the line of children musicians, Whitney tells them: ‘Thank-you, thank-you for the treat…come, give me a kiss.'

As 
Daphne asks what Bobbi would want the world to know about Whitney, Bobbi pauses: ‘That she had a heart, you could not 
fall in love with her. Even if she cast you off - she so lovable.’

Bobbi is now awaiting the first $1.2million from her the $12million estate her mother left her to claim by the time she’s 30.

Sadly, it is patently clear just how much Whitney and Bobby were thrilled to be expecting baby Bobbi.

The
 couple had met at the Soul Train Music Awards in 1989 and in an interview 
on their marriage in Vanity Fair in December 1992, Whitney, then three-months pregnant, prophesised: ‘I think it’s a girl…’

Happy family? Whitney Houston, Bobby Brown and Bobbi Kristina Brown

The
 couple kissed and Brown patted Whitney’s stomach, adding: ‘I’m gonna 
spoil that baby girl….I want presents. Lots of presents. Shoes and 
dresses and diamonds and all that for her.’

‘You want everything, baby’, Whitney replied….’We’ll see, we’ll see.’

More of the 25-minute wedding video will be aired globally next month in a Daphne Barak special.

Filmmaker Daphne, who was also on hand to watch some 
of Amy Winehouse’s tragic last days in St Lucia, tells MailOnline: ‘When
 I saw Whitney in the video she looked like Princess Diana, so regal. In
 her imagination, she was royal and Bobby was her prince.
