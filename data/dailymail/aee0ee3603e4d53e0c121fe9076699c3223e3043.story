Father set fire to himself when military delivered news of eldest son's death

When Carlos Arredondo heard of the death of his eldest son, 20-year-old  Lance Corporal Alexander Arredondo, while serving in Iraq in 2004, the grief-stricken father almost took his own life.

He was dealt another devastating blow, when his second son Brian, 24, committed suicide just before Christmas as the final troops withdrew from the war which killed his brother.

Brian Arredondo, of Boston, had suffered with depression and battled drug addiction ever since Alexander's death.

Their father Carlos Arredondo, 51, told the Boston Herald: 'We are broken hearts.'

His son Brian had attended grief counseling following the death of his older brother and had previously attempted suicide in 2006. He died on December 19.

Melida Arredondo, Brian's stepmother, told Wicked Local Roslindale: 'He died (close to) the last day of the 
war in Iraq and his brother was not coming home… we’re not sure but we 
think that contributed.'

The young man's funeral took place on December 28 at St Thomas Aquinas Parish and he was later laid to rest next to his brother at   Rural Cemetery in Walpole.

In 2004, when the military arrived at his Roslindale home to tell Mr Arredondo of his son Alexander's death, he almost died when he set fire to himself as he tried to destroy their van in anguish.

Mr Arredondo has since become one of the most visible and 
poignant figures of the anti-war movement, driving around the
 country in his pick-up truck, carrying a flag-draped coffin and 
plastered with pictures of Alex. 

The native of Costa Rica was helped obtain U.S. citizenship by the late Senator Edward 
Kennedy and is regularly seen at anti-war rallies, holding his son's desert boots and dog tags.

'Ever since his brother died, he had a very hard time. He was tortured. Just tortured.'

The boys' mother Victoria Foley told the Boston Herald her sons 'were joined at the hip. And ever since his brother died, he had a very hard time. He was tortured. Just tortured'.

Alexander Arredondo joined the Marines aged 17 after they recruited him in high school, offering him help with college tuition in return. After basic training in California, he was deployed to Iraq in 2004.

On August 25, 2004, the day of his 44th birthday, Carlos Arredondo was working in his front yard when van of Marines turned up to inform him that his  son had been killed in action.

Overwhelmed with grief, he grabbed a five-gallon can of gasoline and a torch from his garage and doused the van, setting fire to himself in the process. He suffered burns to 26 per cent of his body and attended his son Alexander's funeral on a stretcher. 

Mr Arredondo told The Nation in 2006: 'Wanting to reach him I was lifted off the stretcher... I lay on top of the casket, on top of my son, apologizing to him because I did nothing for him to avoid this moment. Nothing.'

A plaque dedicated to Alexander Arredondo - and now also to his brother Brian - sits outside the First Church in the neighbourhood of Jamaica Plain, Boston.
