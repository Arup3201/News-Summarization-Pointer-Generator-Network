Model and fashion muse Alexa Chung has both beauty and a business brain.

The 30-year-old's debut make-up collection for Eyeko completely sold out in Selfridges on launch day and the store was on the brink of closing because Alexa drew in such a big crowd.

The fashionista, who has won three British Style Awards and was even dubbed 'beautiful' and a 'phenomenon' by Karl Lagerfeld and Anna Wintour, couldn't be happier with her successful foray into beauty.

Her management told MailOnline: 'Alexa's
 collection for Eyeko was a resounding success and had Selfridges on the
 brink of closing down on the day of launch.

Beauty and brains: Alexa Chung, posing in a Luisa Becarria dress, Valentino shoes and Loquet London necklace, has seen her debut collection for Eyeko sell out in Selfridges

'People travelled from as far as Indonesia to have the chance to meet with Alexa.'

In her new role as Creative 
Consultant at Eyeko, Alexa has used her beauty know-how, as well as her 
illustrative and photographic talents, to custom-design the first in a 
line of limited edition sets.

The star has created a thick nib eyeliner and a 
mascara so that beauty aficionados can re-create her signature cat flick
 eyes.

Flick it: Alexa made the iconic feline flick her own and now she has created an eyeliner so that fans can emulate her

Sharing her top tips for achieving the iconic Alexa flick, she told MailOnline: 'I started doing this cat eye flick when I was about 17 and I do it every single day, so I've had years of practice.

'I do the outside flick first, just 
one line, then see if they're even and level then I'll just draw the 
rest in to match it but sometimes I do it too thick and have to start 
again; I am obsessed with perfecting it. My record time is about a 
minute and half on a good day,' she said.

Alexa hopes her new products, which have quirky names - such as the 'eye do' liquid eyeliner - will help her fans emulate her look.

Speaking
 about her eyeliner, she said: 'The nib is the perfect shape and size to
 give you control. It gives you the precision to draw on the perfect cat
 eye.

'It’s pitch black and waterproof so 
it doesn’t move even on the waterline. I love that it enhances my lashes
 each time I use it.'

Brains behind the brand: Established in 1999, Eyeko was devised by make-up veterans and partners Max and Nina Leykind (pictured here with newest recruit, Alexa)

Alexa Chung for Eyeko will cost £35 per set and is available on eyeko.com and at Space NK

Desperate to emulate Alexa's signature cat flick eyeliner and smokey eyed look, FEMAIL writer Bianca London put her new range to the test...

'A lot of girls want to look like Alexa, she has that "just rolled out of bed" indie girl style so when she unveiled her debut make-up range, we were keen to give it a spin.

The mascara is good, very thick and lasts all day and it's good to know that it's helping to condition your lashes whilst you wear it.

It's pretty tough to get off though, we recommend using a gentle eye make-up remover like The Body Shop's Camomile Kind Eye remover as it can be quite stubborn.

As for the eyeliner, if you have the knack for applying it, it looks great. However, it is very, very black so may be too heavy on some fair-haired ladies.

The packaging is what wins us over and would be great as a Christmas stocking filler.'
