A grieving father has been run over and killed during an attempt to walk across America in a campaign against homophobic bullying after his gay son took his own life earlier this year.

Joe Bell was struck by a truck in eastern Colorado on Wednesday evening as he walked along the shoulder of a highway.

The 48-year-old from Oregon began his 5,000-mile walk in April to raise awareness about gay rights after the death of his 15-year-old son Jadin in January.

Bullied: Jadin died in hospital after attempting to take his own life in January

Truck driver Kenneth Raven has been cited with careless driving resulting in death, and police believe he may have fallen asleep at the wheel, the Gay Star News reported.

On the Joe's Walk for Change Facebook page, a post announced Mr Bell's death and paid tribute to the father who had been speaking at schools and clubs across the U.S. about homophobic bullying.

He had been due to talk to a youth group
in Hugo, Colorado, on the night he was killed. A few hours before his 
death, Mr Bell posted a picture of a road sign on Facebook with the caption: 'Making
headway, one step at a time.'

The organizer of the Facebook page later announced his death, saying: ‘I am very sad to have to announce that our friend Joe Bell was hit and struck by a semi while on his walk last night.'

‘He will continue his journey now with Jadin,’ the spokesman, named only as Ann, added.

Mr Bell's son suffered brain damage after attempting to hang himself at a La Grande school on January 19.

Support: Jadin's father decided to embark on the walk as a way to deal with his grief

He was kept on life support for a few days, before Mr Bell and Jadin's mother Lola Lathrop agreed to end treatment after doctors registered little brain activity.

The 15-year-old student had been the victim of relentless bullying in school and on social media sites because of his sexuality.

'He was different, and they tend to pick on the different ones,' family friend Bud Hill told KOMO News at the time.

Mr Bell, who has another son and a daughter, came up with the idea for the two-year walk after struggling to come to terms with Jadin's death.

He told OPB he was left with a feeling of emptiness but needed to get through it so he could be there for Jadin's siblings.

'So I decided I needed to walk across the United States,' he said.

He began his walk in Oregon in April, traveling up to 25 miles a day as he raised awareness for Faces for Change, the anti-bullying foundation set up in Jadin's memory, according to the Huffington Post.

'We need to stop this bullying - it starts in our households, how we raise our children,' Mr Bell said at the time. 'We need to educate our school systems on how to deal with it; they don't know how to deal with the problem.'

Loss: Friends and supporters who met Joe on his walk have paid tribute to the father

Those he met on the walk left tributes to Mr Bell on Facebook, thanking him for his 'life-changing legacy' and offering sympathy to the family.

At one stop on his journey, Mr Bell told a youth group about when Jadin first told them he was gay, the Denver Post reported.

'My son didn't choose to be gay. My son was different at a very young age,' Mr Bell had told the group. 'He told his family he was gay because he knew they would accept him. I hugged him and kissed him on the cheek every day. I was proud of him.'
