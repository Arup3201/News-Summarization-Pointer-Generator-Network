Amanda Knox's Italian ex-boyfriend Rafaele Sollecito was so confident that their acquittals for the murder of Meredith Kercher would be upheld that he had planned a new life in Switzerland.

The 29-year-old was planning to move to Lugano in Switzerland to start up an internet security firm, it was claimed today.

But his plans may have been thwarted after Italy's highest court yesterday quashed the acquittal of Knox and her ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito.

Amanda Knox's Italian ex-boyfriend Rafaelle Sollecito  was so confident that their acquittals for the murder of Meredith Kercher would be upheld by Italy's highest court that he had planned a new life in Switzerland.

Decision: Knox is to face a retrial over the 2007 murder of Meredith Kercher

'We weren't expecting a negative outcome', Mr Sollecito told a lecturer at Verona University, where he is studying information technology and robotics, according to Corriere della Sera newspaper.

'I was thinking everything would be cleared up.'

Mr Sollecito has apparently denied suggestions that he was still contemplating fleeing to Switzerland in order to avoid the retrial.

'Switzerland would hardly be a good country to flee to, it's not Brazil,' he reportedly told a friend.

He pointed out that it was close to Italy and had an extradition treaty with Rome.

Knox and Sollecito spoke on the phone soon after yesterday’s verdict.

Sollecito’s current girlfriend Annie Achille said: ‘They will see what can be done.’ She added that her boyfriend, who turned 29 yesterday, is ‘destroyed’ and not talking to anyone.

Yesterday’s ruling by the supreme court in Rome means the case will be tried again next year after judges accepted that there were ‘contradictions’ in the case.

In a dramatic turnaround, the pair, who both spent four years behind bars before they were cleared in 2011, were told they must stand trial again for the murder of the 21-year-old British student.

Knox, who has rebuilt her life in her home town of Seattle, cannot be compelled by Italian law to appear at the retrial and might not face extradition for years, if at all.

Sollecito remained in Italy and is 
studying robotic surgery at the University of Verona. He has already 
released a book about his experience.

In it he said that he and Knox were still in touch – he visited her earlier this year and they speak on Skype regularly.

Meredith Kercher, from Coulsdon, Surrey, was in Italy as an exchange student from Leeds University. She was found dead in 2007, in the cottage she shared with Knox in the picturesque hilltop town of Perugia.

Her throat had been slit and her semi-naked body had been covered with a duvet. After a lengthy trial in Perugia, Knox and Sollecito were convicted of the murder in December 2009 and sentenced to 26 and 25 years respectively,

But two years later the pair were freed after an appeal court found that the case had been botched and DNA evidence contaminated.

A third suspect, Rudy Guede, whose DNA and bloody footprints were found all over the crime scene, is serving a 16-year prison sentence, reduced from 30 years on appeal.
