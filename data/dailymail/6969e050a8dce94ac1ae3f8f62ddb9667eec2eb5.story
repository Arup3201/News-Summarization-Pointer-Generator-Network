His wife may be behind the nation's biggest healthy-eating campaign, but even the president is allowed one day off a year.

President Barack Obama is celebrating Thanksgiving with a quiet family dinner at the White House - where he will be feasting on a choice of nine pies.

The first family will have a 
choice of huckleberry pie, pecan pie, chocolate cream pie, sweet potato 
pie, peach pie, apple pie, pumpkin pie, banana cream pie or coconut cream pie, The Hill reported. The selection offers three more pies than last year.

Savory dishes on the menu include turkey, honey-baked ham, cornbread stuffing, oyster 
stuffing, greens, macaroni and cheese, sweet potatoes, mashed potatoes, 
green bean casserole and dinner rolls.

Tucking in: President Obama (pictured in Nevada in 2008) will have a choice of nine pies at Thanksgiving dinner in the White House today. He will also enjoy turkey, ham and macaroni cheese

The gluttonous menu would seem at odds with Michelle Obama's 'Let's Move!' anti-obesity campaign, but she has previously conceded that exceptions can be made on special occasions.

Some previous presidents have chosen to spend the holiday at Camp David, the secluded Maryland mountaintop retreat, but the Obamas have chosen to stay at the Executive Mansion.

The guest list for the private dinner wasn't made public, so it was not clear who would be helping the president, first lady Michelle and daughters Sasha and Malia with all of those pies.

Ahead of the dinner, Obama called several members of the armed forces to thank them for their service to the country.

Traditions: Obama makes a Thanksgiving Day phone call to a member of the U.S. military stationed overseas, from the Oval Office this morning. He called 10 service members to say thanks

The White House said he talked to 10 service members - two each from the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force and Coast Guard.

The White House said the president wished them and their families 'a happy Thanksgiving'.

The White House Thanksgiving menu includes turkey, honey-baked ham, cornbread stuffing, oyster 
stuffing, greens, macaroni and cheese, sweet potatoes, mashed potatoes, 
green bean casserole and dinner rolls.

For dessert, the family will have a 
choice of huckleberry pie, pecan pie, chocolate cream pie, sweet potato 
pie, peach pie, apple pie, pumpkin pie, banana cream pie or coconut cream pie, The Hill reported. (The selection offers three more pies than last year.)

The family's feast came after a day of Thanksgiving traditions.

Obama continued an annual family tradition on Wednesday by helping to pack bags of food and distribute them to the needy on Thanksgiving eve.

Obama, Michelle, Malia and Sasha, and his mother-in-law, Marian Robinson, dropped in on the Capital Area Food Bank (CAFB), one of the largest serving the Washington area.

They placed bundles of sweet potatoes, onions, carrots and apples into reusable bags people held open as they walked by. They also handed out small white boxes stamped with the presidential seal that contain M&M's candy.

Obama wished people a 'Happy Thanksgiving' while Malia shook their hands.

It's the third straight Thanksgiving that Obama and his family have helped out at this particular food bank.Â 

Helping hand: On Wednesday, Obama, Michelle and their daughters Sasha and Malia helped distribute bags of food to needy children and seniors at the Capital Area Food Bank in Washington D.C.

Making peace: He also pardoned the 2013 National Thanksgiving Turkey 'Popcorn' with Sasha and Malia

Earlier in the day, Obama spared two turkeys from the brine and the oven.

Obama pardoned Popcorn, who shared the stage with the president on the North Portico of the White House on a cold, drizzly day.

An alternate turkey, named Caramel, also received a pardon, though it did not have the benefit of a face-to-beak meeting with the president.

The turkeys will be on display at George Washington's Mount Vernon Estate and Gardens through January 6.

Presidents have spared turkeys off and on as far back as the Lincoln era, according to the White House. The first official pardon was granted by President George HW Bush.
