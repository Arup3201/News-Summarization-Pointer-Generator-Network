These hypnotic flashes over Italy are unlike any lightning storm you’ve ever seen before.

The stunning Vine was captured by astronaut Reid Wiseman as he looked down on Earth from his 150 mile (250km) vantage point on the ISS.

It shows the awesome power of the storm lighting up the country and, according to the post yesterday, left Wiseman ‘speechless.’

Vine is a mobile service that creates short looping videos which are six seconds or less.

In an interview last year with MailOnline, former Commander of the ISS, Chris Hadfield said that lightning shows were one of the best parts watching Earth from the ISS.

‘Imagine you’re lying in bed, with your eyes closed, and there is this tremendous light show coming through your eyes that keeps exploding,’ he said, describing an immense storm over Indonesia.

‘It looked as if someone with a fat paint brush was swiping it over the Earth for about 500 miles, this great bright light, and it was continuous, back and forth…If there had been gravity, my jaw would have dropped.’ 

In June, the 38-year-old made history by becoming the first ISS crew member to send a Vine from space.

The short timelapse condensed a 92-minute orbit into the span of around six seconds showing the space station hurtling around the planet at 17,500 mph (27,600 km/h).

The sun never sets in the Vine because the space station's orbit comes into alignment with something known as the day and night ‘terminator’ line.

But it seems lightning is one of Wiseman’s favourite phenomenon’s to film as he looks down on the planet.

In a clip from June the astronaut, originally from Baltimore, Maryland, showed a lightning storm above the city of Houston, Texas.

And earlier this week, Wiseman tweeted an image of Typhoon Halong blanketing Earth. The typhoon is churning toward Japan’s southern main island of Kyushu today.

Another image taken in June this year shows an amazing light show over Malaysia. 

Wiseman has taken over the mantle of incredible ISS social media posts from Commander Chris Hadfield, who posted on Twitter, Facebook and Tumblr to a large following of people around the world.

In an interview last year with MailOnline, Hadfield said that lightning shows were one of the best parts watching Earth from the ISS.

Wiseman has been one of the most active astronaut’s on social media since arrived at the ISS in May
