Five years ago this week a devastating 7.0 magnitude earthquake hit Port-Au-Prince, the capital of Haiti, all-but obliterating the city in the process.

The tremor, the strongest to hit the island since 1770, killed 300,000, left 1.5million homeless and destroyed 60 per cent of the country's government buildings - including the National Palace.

But despite £8.6billion being handed over in donations and foreign aid since the crisis began, much of the country still lies in ruins or is waiting to be rebuilt.

Then and now: Five years have passed since Port-Au-Prince, the capital of Haiti, was all-but destroyed by a 7.0 magnitude earthquake, but as this image of a street shows, little has changed there

Where the Beaux Arts-style National Palace once stood, there is now nothing more than an empty field with a solitary flagpole.

The old structure has been cleared away, part of the 19million cubic metres of rubble which was removed after the disaster, but the new building has not been started yet.

Elsewhere the city's cathedral is still nothing more than a series of half-demolished walls, just as it appeared in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake.

Thousands of desperate Haitians arrived in the days following January 12, 2010, to shelter under tarpaulins in the ruins of the holy building.

The tent cities became a hotbed of cholera which spread among the ruins of Port-Au-Prince, which was at severe risk from flooding. 

Destroyed: Almost 1.5million people were left homeless, with many thousands taking refuge in the city's destroyed cathedral. Five years on, some of them are still there (pictured in 2010 above, and today below)

While 95 per cent of those people have now been rehoused, the cathedral still lies in ruins, and there is also evidence of people still living up against its walls.

In another set of images from a local market, little difference is visible between 2010 and today save that a few splintered power lines have been cleared away.

Meanwhile the flattened Twins Market has been cleared away, though little more than a corrugated iron fence stands in its place.

One of the few structures to have been fully rebuilt is Iron Market after one of Haiti's biggest employers, DigiCel, stepped forward to provide funding.

Flattened: The National Palace was destroyed in the quake, along with 60 per cent of the country's government buildings. Today there is little more than a flagpole to mark where it once stood

The market's old green and red metal frame has been replaced, while the walls surrounding it have also been repaired and traders have returned to sell their wares.

However, it is clear that officials who promised in the weeks after the disaster that the city would be 'built back better' have fallen woefully short of their target.

Port-Au-Prince, a city in which the vast majority of people lived and worked in poorly-built concrete shanty-towns, was virtually razed to the ground when the earthquake struck in 2010.

Eighty per cent of the city's schools were destroyed, the main hospital collapsed, and a quarter of all public servants perished.

Even before the disaster, nearly three quarters of the population lived on less than $2 a day, with half having no access to running water or toilets, so after the earthquake the poverty was acute.

All gone: This destroyed Twins Market building (pictured above in 2010) has now been cleared, but has been replaced by little more than an iron fence (below) making a mockery of promises to 'build back better' 

Poor sanitation lead to a cholera outbreak which killed an estimated 9,000 people as parts of the capital descended into a state of anarchy.

Donations and relief workers flooded in from around the globe to help with the cleanup. Emergency food needed to be found for 4million people.

Among the first projects to get underway were health clinics, schools and a new power plant to allow the city to function once again.

However, five years on at least 200,000 people are living in hillside slums around the capital, little more than tin huts without access to running water or electricity.

Despite the best efforts of the global community and officials in the impoverished country, there is still a long way to go. 

Rebuilt: One of the few structures to have been fully restored is the city's Iron Market, which was reconstructed after one of Haiti's largest employers, DigiCel, put forward the money (pictured above in 2010, and today below)
