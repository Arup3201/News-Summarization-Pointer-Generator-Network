Liverpool may have lost Luis Suarez over the summer but it appears they have a new source of spectacular goals coming through the ranks.

Melbourne-born 16-year-old Jake Brimmer demonstrated a phenomenal technique playing for Australia Under 16s to twice find the net from 25 yards.

The first saw Brimmer strike the ball over the wall into the near top corner, going in via the crossbar, while the second went the other way, going round the wall into the far side of the net.

It must be admitted that, if the other Australian goals are anything to go by, the Japan Under 16s goalkeeper may not be the sternest of opponents.

But Liverpool fans will enjoy the strikes, and the possibility of another high-class youngster breaking through towards the first team.
