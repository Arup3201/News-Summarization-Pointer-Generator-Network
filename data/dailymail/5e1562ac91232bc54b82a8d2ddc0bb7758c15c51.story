The taxpayer faces a compensation bill running into the tens of millions of pounds from miscarriages of justice linked to a secret undercover police unit.

Hundreds of animal rights activists, neo-Nazi groups, campaigners for black justice and other campaigners who, unknowingly, were spied on by the Special Demonstration Squad could have their convictions overturned.

Only a handful of cases involving officers from the special Met squad, which operated from the late 1960s, have been made public.

Anyone jailed and found to have suffered a miscarriage of justice could launch civil proceedings against the Met and the Home Office.

Last night, Jules Carey of Bindmans solicitors warned the cases which have become known about represented the ‘tip of the iceberg’.

Nearly 150 officers worked for the SDS from its formation but only nine names have come to light.

Yesterday two animal rights activists jailed for firebombing a department store said they would appeal against their convictions.

Police Minister Damian Green said the SDS was not operating within the rules and it was 'out of control by modern standards throughout its existence'

Andrew Clarke and Geoff Sheppard, of the Animal Liberation Front, were convicted of planting bombs at Debenhams stores in Romford and Luton in 1987 over its selling of fur products.

But they claim an undercover police officer planted a third device at a branch in Harrow to help convict the men.

In January, 29 climate change protesters had their convictions quashed because the role of an undercover officer, Mark Kennedy, was never disclosed.

The protesters boarded a freight train carrying coal to the Drax power plant in Selby, North Yorkshire in June 2008.

At their trials it was never revealed that Kennedy had infiltrated the group. The Appeal Court quashed the convictions because of the lack of disclosure.

A review of all cases involving the SDS was ordered on Thursday by Home Secretary Theresa May. It is thought the activities of undercover officers could even extend to families of Hillsborough victims, who allege they were spied upon.

Police Minister Damian Green said the SDS was not operating within the rules. He told the BBC: ‘All the evidence suggests that it was out of control by modern standards throughout its existence. Not just this government but previous governments have tightened up the way undercover operations can happen.

‘It does seem... that what was happening then was outside the rules even at the time. If illegality is proved then clearly there should be prosecutions.’

Mr Carey, whose firm represented the Drax protesters, said: ‘The harm and injustice caused by undercover policing operations is shocking.

An officer linked to the SDS is claimed to have invaded the Lawrence family's privacy - reporting to Scotland Yard bosses about the breakdown of their marriage. The revelations were exposed in the Ellison report into the case today

‘Woman deceived into long term sexual relations, mothers who discovered that the identity of their dead baby had been appropriated, justice campaigners around the Lawrences and others smeared, wrongful convictions caused by officers acting as agent provocateurs and workers deprived of employment because they were put on a blacklist, to name but a few.

‘But in reality this is the tip of the iceberg. We are a long way from knowing the true scale of injustice and the damage caused by undercover policing.

‘It is my sincere hope that the scope of the proposed public inquiry will be sufficiently broad to cover all these matters so that a line can finally be drawn under this shameful episode in British policing.’
