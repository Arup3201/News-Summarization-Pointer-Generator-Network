A blind man who crashed a car just minutes after getting behind the wheel for the first time has been banned from the roads.

Paul Keatings, 42, persuaded his friend to let him drive a powerful Subura Impreza while on a day out.

Keatings, who is registered blind and walks with the support of a stick, drove for less than a mile before he came within inches of knocking down a pedestrian.

His journey came to a halt just moments later when he smashed into a boulder at the entrance to the New Lanark Mill Hotel in Lanakrshire near Glasgow.

Keatings was charged by police following the incident on May 25 and appeared at Lanark Sheriff Court today where he admitted driving dangerously through blindness.

He also admitted to driving without insurance and with only a provisional licence, which he gained before he turned almost completely blind due to a congenital eye condition in his late twenties.

He was disqualified from driving for 
32 months, told he would have to sit an extended driving test before 
gaining a licence if his sight ever improves and placed under supervision for two years.

Speaking about the incident last month, Keatings, of Wishaw, Lanarkshire, told how his motoring dream ended in disaster.

He said 'I used to have a provisional licence and driving has always been a lifelong dream.

'When my friend suggested I give it a try I jumped at the chance.

'He drives a Subaru which is the same model as the rally driver Colin McRae famously drove.

'He had one hand on the steering wheel and the other on the hand brake.

'I had both hands on the steering wheel.

'I felt safe enough because I was going slow and my friend had his hand on the wheel and was telling me where to go.

'But the next thing I knew we had hit a huge rock.

'I was shaken up and was just glad no-one had been hurt.

'I know it was a really silly thing to do and I’m sorry for what I’ve done.

'I’m really embarrassed about the whole thing.'

His friend Brian Gillon, 33, whose father’s car was the vehicle involved, was also banned for 32 months after he admitted allowing a person unfit through blindness to drive the car and permitting a person with no insurance to drive the car.

Gillon was also given a two year community payback order and told he must carry out 200 hours of unpaid work.

Keating's sight has deteriorated badly in recent years and he is now only able to discern 'vague shadows'.

He added: 'I have Leber’s disease which is a hereditary condition passed down from my mum’s side.

'I started going blind when I was 28 and within a month I’d almost completely lost my sight.'

The court heard that at around 3pm on May 25 visitors to New Lanark noticed a car being driven erratically down the hill towards the centre of the village, swerving across the road and nearly hitting a pedestrian.

The car then careered into one of the boulders at the side of the entrance gates to the hotel and was it was captured by CCTV cameras.

The court also heard that Mr Gillon had to help Paul steer the vehicle during the brief journey.
