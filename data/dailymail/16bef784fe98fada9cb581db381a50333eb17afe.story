Wanted: Police believe Eugene Palmer, 73, may still be alive and on the run after shooting his daughter-in-law dead and then taking off into the wilderness in September 2012

Police fear a retired park ranger accused of gunning down his daughter-in-law before fleeing into the wilderness of upstate New York 19 months ago is alive and still on the run.

Authorities previously believed that 73-year-old Eugene Palmer of Stoney Point was dead after escaping into Herriman State Park only moments after allegedly admitting to committing the cold-blooded crime.

Crime stoppers are offering a  $2,500 reward for information regarding his whereabouts.

Police accuse Palmer of fatally shooting Tammy Palmer, 39, three times as she was walking home from dropping her two children off at a school bus on September 24th.

After allegedly confessing to the crime to his sister, Elaine Babcock, she says he took off into the 45,000-acre park, an area authorities say he's well familiar with and backs onto their property.

'We thoroughly searched these woods over the course of two weeks, I don't believe he's here,' Sgt Lutz said. 'He knows that park like the back of his hand.'

'I believe he went into those woods and eventually came out,' Sgt. George Lutz of the Haverstraw Police Department told FoxNews.com on Friday.

Lutz declined to elaborate further on that theory.

Killed: Tammy Palmer, pictured right with her two children, was shot dead on Monday September 24 after walking her children to a school bus stop

Authorities at the time thought there was no chance he could have survived the woods considering the impending winter's freezing temperatures.

Palmer's son also says he's convinced his father's dead with the 73-year-old being a severe diabetic and was on heart medication.

When asked if he suspects Palmer is still alive, Lutz  told Fox, 'Of course.'

'We are investigating this case as if he's alive,' he said. 'We have no proof that he's not. We're not going to stop investigating until we have Mr. Palmer or his remains.'

Authorities' search has expanded internationally as well.

Palmer was charged with the murder of Tammy Palmer two months after she was killed.

His truck was found in nearby Harriman State Park on the same day Tammy was killed and officers began their search for him..

Tammy Palmer's family claimed that 
Eugene Palmer had began a campaign of harassment against her after the 
39-year-old took out an order of protection against her estranged 
husband, John.

Crime scene: Tammy Palmer lived in this home on property shared with Eugene Palmer but had filed a restraining order against his son, and her husband, fueling her murder according to family

Great escape: Authorities say they have combed through Harriman State Park's 46,600-acres (pictured) since his disappearance but have yet to find a body or a trace of his presence

The order prevented him from entering
 the home where she was raising their two children, aged 12 and 16. She 
lived in a separate house but on the same property as her father-in-law.

Babcock, Palmer's sister claimed he rushed to her house straight after the killing and admitted what he'd done.

'He just came in and said, "Here’s money to pay my taxes with, I’ve had enough.

"I
 shot and killed Tammy. Give me an hour to get away and then do whatever
 you have to do — call the police... whatever you have to do," and then 
he just took off,' Babcock told CBS.

Babcock said she immediately called police.

Search teams began hunting woods 
for the man, a retired park ranger, using tracking dogs and helicopters. They soon discovered his vehicle, a 1995 green Dodge Ram 
pickup truck.

Tammy Palmer's parents are struggling to come to terms with the loss of their daughter. They say her relationship with her father-in-law had grown increasingly ugly, culminating in a fight.

Harassed: Before her September 24, 2012 death, Tammy Palmer, pictured left, said the man had been harassing her since she separated from his son, John

Mourning: Violet Pannirello, left, says her daughter Tammy's, right, relationship with her father in law had grown ugly. Tammy had just dropped her children at the school bus when she was shot dead

'She
 told me "Mommy, don’t worry I’ll be alright." I don’t think she ever 
thought that this man would kill her,' Tammy's mother Violet Pannirello 
told CBS.

'She’s gone. She’s resting. She’s not scared anymore. It’s so sad,' Pannirello said.

Detectives have previously revealed the details of 
Palmer's criminal past and warned that he is believed to be dangerous - 
owning to a large gun collection.

It has been reported by police that the grandfather had previously threatened to kill a Department of Environmental Conservation officer.

He was arrested and charged 
with second-degree aggravated harassment after he made repeated 'life 
threatening' calls to Department of Environmental Conservation employee Kenneth Didion’s home over a period 
of months starting in December 1984, The Journal News reported.

Palmer, working as a truck driver at 
the time, pleaded guilty in April 1986 and the next month was sentenced 
to one year probation and fined $750. He also was ordered to avoid any 
contact with Didion for a year.
