Manners matter, whether you are human or not, and this frog appears to be minding his.

The cheerful amphibian was giving the camera a big wave goodbye before he jumped to the next leaf.

Although the tiny tree frog looks like he was brought up right in the first shot, it seems the attention soon made his mood change.

Adios! The little tree frog appears to be waving goodbye to the camera before he departs

In the second snap he appears to have 
had it with the photographer and does not look too different from a 
celebrity trying to hide from a paparazzo.

Eka Novianto Nugroho caught the frog in the act at Taman Safari Indonesia , an animal conservatorium in Bogor at West Java.

The tree frog rarely grows to be bigger than 4in and, as its name alludes, spend a majority of its life in the treetops.

The disc-like fingers gives it the 
grip advantage needed when climbing leaves and twigs and its limbs 
are normally more slender than frogs living on the ground.

There are six different families of 
tree frogs spread all over the world, but can mainly be found in 
tropical regions of Asia, Australia and the Americas as well as 
sub-Saharan Africa.

Although their size help the frog avoid its enemies, many types of tree frogs can also change colour to camouflage themselves.

A majority of tree frogs spend their 
entire lives in the tree tops with the exception for when they 
reproduce, with most laying their eggs in water.

Tree frogs that live in varying climates will burrow on the forest floor when winter approaches.

Thanks to their bodies' own production
of glycerol their tirrues and body fluids are protected from freezing 
when temperatures drop.
