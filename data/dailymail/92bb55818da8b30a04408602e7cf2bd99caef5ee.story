Few things irritate great coaches more than suggestions that their teams are unsophisticated. It undermines everything they like to think they stand for. It pricks their ego.

With this in mind, the moment Louis van Gaal walked in to a press conference room holding four pieces of A4 paper on Tuesday, it was always likely that an interesting 20 minutes or so lay ahead.

The print-outs were Prozone stats sheets, breaking down the play from Manchester United's draw at West Ham on Sunday. The intention was to debunk the theory - raised by West Ham's Sam Allardyce after the weekend's game - that United had resorted to long-ball football at Upton Park.

'When a colleague of mine is saying this kind of thing then, yeah, you have to see the data and you have to put the data in the right context,' said Van Gaal.

'I have made an interpretation of the data for this game and then I have to say that it is not a good interpretation from Big Sam. It is not so difficult to read that.

'I give it you, you can copy it and then maybe you can go to Big Sam and he will get a good interpretation.'

West Ham made just 11 of their 32 'long and forward' passes during the match, according to boss Van Gaal 

Van Gaal claims United made 49.9 per cent of 'long passes forward' in comparison to West Ham's 71 per cent

This page suggests United played 12 long passes after 76 minutes of their 1-1 draw at Upton Park on Sunday. Eight of them were successful.

Van Gaal's argument on Tuesday was clear. His team's long passes were, he said, aimed at spreading the play wide. They were not long, high deliveries up field. That only started, he added, when Marouane Fellaini came on with 20 minutes to go.

'We scored from that, so I think it was a very good decision of the manager,' Van Gaal added.

It was a clear argument and one that didn't actually need the bits of paper and the red and blue arrows to explain. In truth, the whole intriguing spectacle perhaps said more about Van Gaal himself than it did about his team's football.

An immediate comparison was made by many to Rafael Benitez's infamous 'facts' tirade back when his Liverpool team were challenging Sir Alex Ferguson's United in 2009. Benitez referred to a piece of paper that day, too. 

United's change of tack came after 6ft 4in Fellaini was brought on in the second half,  Van Gaal claimed

On that occasion, however, Benitez just looked like a man buckling under pressure, a coach frazzled by the intensity of the duel with his great rival.

Tuesday seemed to be about something else entirely. It seemed more like a coach seeking to protect a reputation forged by years spent at Ajax, Barcelona and Bayern Munich. It was as dismissive as it was carefully constructed.

'When you have 60% ball possession do you think that you can do that with long balls?' asked Van Gaal rhetorically.

'Yeah, long balls, in the width, to switch the play. You have to look at the data and then you will see that we did play long balls, but long balls wide, rather than to the striker.

'A ball straight up to the forward is long ball play. I am sorry, but we are playing ball possession play and after 70 minutes we did not succeed, in spite of many chances in the second half, so then I changed my playing style.'

Whether Van Gaal's performance on Tuesday looked a little over the top is certainly a pertinent question. Only some improved football from his team will end an argument that is actually a lot wider than Van Gaal allowed it to be.

The current issue about United's football is not restricted to the distance of their passes. It is more general than that. It is about entertainment and a coach's ability to get the best from his players. Is Van Gaal currently doing that? Few would say so.

When a colleague of mine is saying this kind of thing then, yeah, you have to see the data and you have to put the data in the right context I believe.

I think the media is also coming to the match and you have a lot of opinion about me, or the game, or the players and now you say that you have no opinion. 

When you have 0 per cent ball possession do you think that you can do that with long balls? Yeah, long balls, in the width, to switch the play. You have to look at the data and then you will see that we did play long balls, but long balls wide, rather than to the striker.  A ball to the forward striker is mainly caused by long-ball play. 

Because I expected this question, I have made an interpretation of the data for this game and then I have to say that it is not a good interpretation from Big Sam. 

It is not so difficult also to read that. I am sorry, but we are playing ball possession play and after 70 minutes we did not succeed, in spite of many chances in the second half, then I changed my playing style. 

Then, of course, with the quality of Fellaini we played more forward balls and we scored from that, so I think it was a very good decision of the manager. 

But, when you see overall the long ball, and what is the percentage of that, then West Ham have played 71 per cent of the long balls to the forwards and we 49. 

So, I give you this and you can see that the blue ones are the good ones because long balls are also very difficult, which is why I began with the explanation of ball possession. 

When you have 60 per cent ball possession you cannot play long balls. So again, they did it 71 and we 49, and I give it you, you can copy it and then maybe you can go to Big Sam and he will get a good interpretation. 

Wayne Rooney, for example, is currently playing in midfield and on his worst United scoring run since 2006. He may be relieved, at least, to hear Van Gaal say that his days as a striker are not necessarily over.

'No, it's dependable on the circumstances,' said the 62-year-old. 'How we are satisfied, or not, how he is satisfied, or not. It can change every week.'

Asked next if entertainment was a priority Van Gaal was categorical. He said: 'You know that when you see my career I think that it is enough answer.

'I think we have played attractive games and less attractive games. With every club I think this is the case, so there's no discussion.

'In this world you have to win and play attractive, but that's not so simple. We do our best. Of course, we have never played with the same team because of injuries.

'Still, when you see the fans against Cambridge United, there were a lot of them so they are obviously enjoying the games.

'When I am on the streets they show that to me, so I don't think that we are not playing attractive enough for the fans.

'I always applaud, so I think that everyone is still happy.'

One interesting sub-plot ahead of Wednesday night's game against Burnley at Old Trafford is that in Opta's table of 'long passes', only the Lancashire club have played more than United this season.

It's a label that irritates Burnley manager Sean Dyche, too. He referred to it as 'media myth' after his team's draw with West Brom on Sunday.

It seems, then, that the thorny issue of long-ball football is one that raises the hackles of managers at both ends of the age and pay scale. Dyche has not resorted to bits of paper to defend himself, though. Not yet anyway.
