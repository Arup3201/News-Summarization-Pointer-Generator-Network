Now that Manchester United have confirmed Louis van Gaal as their new manager, attention will turn to what the Dutchman is going to do to turn the club's fortunes around.

Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic have already been shown the door, Patrice Evra also likes likely to leave and a cloud of uncertainty very much hangs over the likes of Nani, Ashley Young, Tom Cleverley and Javier Hernandez.

One thing is for sure, a major rebuilding job is need at Old Trafford, so Sportsmail takes a look at seven of the players that Van Gaal might be targeting before the start of next season.

Running the rule: Louis van Gaal will have his eye on several major transfer signings

Kevin Strootman - Roma

Value: £25mAge: 242013-14 Apps: 28; Goals: 6

Verdict: Left-footed, clever but lacks pace. Knee injury means he won’t be fit until October.

Cesc Fabregas - Barcelona

Value: £45mAge: 272013-14 Apps: 55; Goals: 13

Verdict: Available for sale. United won’t get involved though if there is a hint of last year’s saga.

Toni Kroos - Bayern Munich

Value: £18m Age: 242013-14 Apps: 51; Goals: 4

Verdict: Had agreed to join David Moyes. Van Gaal still an admirer of Munich youth product.

Target: Holland midfielder Kevin Strootman would have been going to the World Cup were it not for injury

Back to Blighty? Arsenal legend Cesc Fabregas could be heading to Manchester

Touted: Bayern Munich midfielder Toni Kroos has been eyeing a move to Old Trafford for a few months

Mats Hummels - Borussia Dortmund

Value: £20m Age: 252013-14 Apps: 28; Goals: 2

Verdict: Lacks some finesse but is a tough defender. Dortmund will sacrifice one big name this summer

Holger Badstuber - Bayern Munich

Value: £15m Age: 252013-14 Apps: 0; Goals: 0

Verdict: Regarded as best left-footed defender in Germany by Van Gaal but just returned from injury.

Sebastian Jung - Eintracht Frankfurt

Value: £7mAge: 232013-14 Apps: 36; Goals: 1

Verdict: Second best right back in Germany behind Philipp Lahm, Arsenal also like the 22-year-old.

Luke Shaw - Southampton

Value: £27mAge: 182013-14 Apps: 36; Goals: 0

Verdict: Will join United once finer details of fee for the England left back are ironed out.
