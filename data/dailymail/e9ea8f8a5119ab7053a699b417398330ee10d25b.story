Chelsea have warned their own supporters ahead of the Capital One Cup final against Tottenham that they will ban anyone using anti-Semitic language and support criminal action against them.

Investigations are ongoing into racist incidents involving some Chelsea fans who travelled to last week’s Champions League game against Paris Saint-Germain. 

Supporters refused to allow a black man on to their Metro carriage and chanted: ‘We’re racist’, leading manager Jose Mourinho to say he was ‘ashamed’.

These flashpoints together with a fierce local rivalry with Spurs, a club with Jewish traditions, have prompted an appeal ahead of Sunday’s Wembley showpiece.

A Chelsea statement said: ‘For a small minority, this game has historically brought a deeply unpleasant and unwanted level of anti-Semitic abuse.

'Opposition supporters using terms as a form of identity is no excuse for abusive chanting or behaviour. The club asks that all supporters realise such actions cause huge offence to those around them. 

'If we receive evidence that supporters have engaged in anti-Semitic or any other form of discriminatory chanting or behaviour, we will take the strongest possible action, including supporting criminal prosecution.

'Recent events in Paris have seen Chelsea fans united in their contempt for a mindless few. 

'Chelsea is proud of the diversity within our club and our vision embraces equality regardless of race, gender, sexuality, disability or religion. We all share the common cause of supporting our team.' 

Sunday’s Capital One Cup final against Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley promises to be a passionate and exciting match with both sets of supporters contributing to an excellent occasion.

After consultation between the Metropolitan Police and both clubs, we would like to remind supporters of their responsibilities on the day.

For a small minority, this game has historically brought a deeply unpleasant and unwanted level of anti-Semitic abuse, which has no place in football or anywhere in society. As such, we urge everyone to keep their support positive.

We launched the Building Bridges campaign in 2010 to promote equality and have worked hard to combat all forms of discrimination both at Stamford Bridge and in our communities.
