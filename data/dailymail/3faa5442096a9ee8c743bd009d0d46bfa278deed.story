The entire Miami Heat basketball team warmed up with their T-shirts inside out on Monday night to show support for the Los Angeles Clippers as Donald Sterling's son-in-law labelled his wife's dad 'ignorant and racist.'

Clippers players expressed their disgust at the racist remarks Sterling allegedly made to his mistress by hiding the team's logo during Sunday night's game.

And now the Heat players, including superstar LeBron James, took part in Charlotte before they took on the Bobcats in a touching display of solidarity to their West Coast brothers.

Meanwhile, Eric Miller, who is married 
to Sterling's daughter Joanna Sterling Miller and is Director of 
Basketball Administration for the Clippers told TMZ Sports that if his 
father-in-law fires him for speaking up about the 'disgusting' rant, so 
be it.

Miller, who works in the day-to-day operation of the team, said he pledged his support to his team's players.

'I find the statements and representations made by the Clippers' team owner to be deplorable and disgusting,' he told TMZ. 'There is no room in sports or society in general, for racism.

'I pledge my full support for the wonderful players, coaches and staff members of the Clippers organization. I have complete faith that Commissioner Silver will deal with this matter swiftly and severely.'

He added: 'If these comments should happen to cost me my employment with the team, it is but a small price to pay to speak out against ignorance and racism.'

Joanna Sterling Miller said she was 'devastated and saddened by the cruel and insensitive comments expressed in these audio tapes.'

NBA commissioner Adam Silver will hold a press conference Tuesday in New York City to address the association's investigation into the alleged racist remarks.

Silver is facing significant pressure to punish Sterling, however there is little modern precedent for the outrageous comments so it's unclear what action will be taken.

If he is somehow forced to sell the Clippers, Sterling would almost certainly bring about a lawsuit from the owner and a long and expensive legal fight.

The players expressed their disgust at the racist remarks Sterling, pictured in 2010, allegedly made to his mistress V. Stiviano, seen with him, by hiding the team's logo during Sunday night's game.

Donald 
Sterling has been known to heckle his own team from the center-court 
seat where he has sat for decades, whether with his now-estranged wife 
or women young enough to be his granddaughters.

Former
 Los Angeles Clippers say the owner would barge into the locker room to 
berate players, offer awkward praise or - according to testimony in a 
lawsuit filed by his fired general manager - tell guests to check out 
his players' 'beautiful black bodies.'

Opponents
 say the racially incendiary remarks attributed to Sterling and leaked 
to TMZ last weekend publicly show a side of the 80-year-old real-estate 
mogul that has been ignored and rationalized for years.

'It
 put a smile on my face that finally he would be unable to deny the 
racist allegations against him,' said Carl Douglas, a lawyer who 
represented former Clippers general manager Elgin Baylor in a lawsuit 
against Sterling.

'This
 is a guy who, as the owner, sits courtside at the half-court line,' 
Douglas added. 'No other owner sits like that. He has an ego the size of
 the Grand Canyon.'

Sterling
 has faced extensive federal charges of civil rights violations and 
racial discrimination in business, making shocking race-related 
statements in sworn testimony before reaching multimillion-dollar 
settlements.

He
 has also been sued for sexual harassment by former employees, and the 
court proceedings detailed an outlandish list of Sterling's personal 
proclivities.

Baylor, the former NBA great who served as the Clippers' GM for 22 years, left the franchise with rancor and an unsuccessful lawsuit alleging race and age discrimination.

Baylor claimed Sterling has a 'plantation mentality' about the Clippers, envisioning a team of 'poor black boys from the South playing for a white coach.'

'When I heard that voice (on the TMZ recordings), there was a visceral reaction,' said Douglas, who deposed Sterling during Baylor's lawsuit. 'I recognized the venom in that voice.'

Sterling's new embarrassment might lead to his long-term banishment from the NBA.

Several major Clippers sponsors dropped or re-evaluated their association with the team Monday, including State Farm, CarMax, Kia Motors America, Virgin America and Red Bull.

But amid the national outrage over the Clippers owner's apparent comments last weekend, former NBA star Kevin Johnson asked the question that must be addressed by Commissioner Adam Silver and the owners who control the league.

'We wanted (Silver) to give us a full accounting of the prior accusations of racism made against Mr. Sterling and why those were never sanctioned by the NBA,' said Johnson, who was asked by Clippers guard Chris Paul to speak for the players' union membership.

'It's our responsibility to find out the history of Mr. Sterling, and why sanctions did not occur.'

Anyone with even a passing knowledge of Sterling's history of discrimination charges and outlandish statements wasn't surprised by the latest revelations.

Sterling's alleged recorded comments included a personal attack on Magic Johnson, which came as a shock to the Dodgers owner and retired Lakers superstar.

'I had a friendship with him, so for him to then make these alleged comments about myself ... there's no place in our society for it,' Johnson said of ABC's pregame show Sunday.
