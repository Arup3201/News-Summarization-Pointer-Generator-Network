A top-secret £133million United States Air Force unmanned drone has flown in British airspace for the first time, it was revealed today.

The Ministry of Defence said the Global Hawk aircraft flew at 50,000ft across several European countries, including the UK, after leaving an air base in the Mediterranean.

It was part of the Nato trial Unified Vision, which aims to assist with the group’s Alliance Ground Surveillance system - expected to become operational with five of the remotely-piloted aircraft.

Drone: The flights took place in 'controlled and segregated airspace at heights of approximately 50,000ft'

Nato said the AGS will give commanders a 'comprehensive picture of the situation on the ground'.

The flights took place in ‘controlled and segregated airspace at heights of approximately 50,000ft, well above the cruising altitude of commercial airliners’, according to an MoD press release.

It added that the flights ‘made a useful contribution to understanding how remotely-piloted air systems (RPAS) can be safely integrated within the existing aviation framework’.

Air Vice Marshal Phil Osborn said: 'It is good to see existing airspace procedures enabling the seamless integration of remotely-piloted air systems, such as the unarmed Global Hawk aircraft, within European airspace.

‘This trial will have helped with the development of the Nato Alliance Ground Surveillance system and the future airspace integration of RPAS.'

Unmanned: The Mail reported four years ago how the drone used to locate Al Qaeda and Taliban hideouts in Pakistan and Afghanistan could one day be patrolling over British cities to search for hidden terror cells

It comes four months ahead of the Nato 
Summit in September - where world leaders will gather in Newport, South Wales, to discuss
 issues such as terrorism, piracy, unstable states and cyber-attacks.

The Mail reported in April 2010 how the drone used to locate Al Qaeda and Taliban hideouts in Pakistan and Afghanistan could one day be patrolling over British cities to search for hidden terror cells.

The controversial move would allow MI5 and GCHQ, the Government's eavesdropping centre, to step up surveillance operations over the UK.

The announcement today comes two weeks after the Pentagon said the US was using at least one Global Hawk to aid in the search for the Nigerian girls kidnapped by Islamist militants Boko Haram.

They became the first drones to be certified by the American Federal Aviation Authority for use in civilian air corridors with no advance notice.

The Global Hawk has a top speed of 357mph and its overall cost per flying hour is about £14,360.
