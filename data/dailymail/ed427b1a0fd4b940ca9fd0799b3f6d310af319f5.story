There have been times during Rob Green’s career as the last line of defence when he has had a raw deal.

Being made the scapegoat for a mistake that allowed Clint Dempsey to equalise for the USA in England’s opening World Cup fixture in South Africa four years ago is one of them.

Returning to the QPR team, to play behind a defence as nervy as new born kittens, is another. Aston Villa at home was the ultimate anxiety test.

Last weekend, when Alex McCarthy deputised for QPR’s first-choice keeper against Liverpool, they looked lost in the big wide world of the Barclays Premier League. Poor McCarthy conceded three.

Green’s double save here, brilliantly denying Tom Cleverley’s long ranger in the 80th minute and smothering the rebound from Ciaran Clark, makes west London feel a whole lot better.

Here, in a match Rangers simply had to win to prevent chairman Tony Fernandes pulling the trigger on Harry Redknapp, the former England keeper offered composure and class. Goodness knows they needed it.

In the first half especially, for all that Richard Dunne bullied Christian Benteke, QPR’s defence played as though the ball was on fire whenever it came near them.

Even the match winner, Charlie Austin, on defensive duties at set pieces, launched a couple of unnecessary balls high into the stands.

Fortunately, when he was presented with chances at the other end, he was clinical. His goals — he notched twice last night against this wretched Villa team — could keep Rangers in the top flight.

At times, before Austin gave them the cushion of a two-goal advantage in the 69th minute, they played as if they had put their boots on the wrong feet.

This defence, comprising left back Yun Suk-young, central defenders Steven Caulker and Dunne, plus right back Mauricio Isla, still needs working on.

If their first touch was bad, their second was usually a tackle.

To think that Caulker was an England international, briefly, when he made his debut against Sweden at the Friends Arena in November 2012. He even scored. This is a different player, someone who has been shifted around a couple of lower-end Premier League clubs since he was allowed to leave Tottenham by Andre Villas-Boas.

Caulker looked a bag of nerves before Austin’s soothing opener, afraid to influence the game at a stage in his career when he should be shouting the odds in this QPR team.

He steadied himself in the second half, but QPR were 2-0 ahead with 21 minutes left on the clock by then. Villa barely posed a threat.

Redknapp has made some big calls of late, jettisoning Rio Ferdinand after the team’s failure to get to grips with the 3-5-2 formation used at the start of the season. Everything is changing.

This team conceded 18 goals in the League before Aston Villa’s arrival at Loftus Road and this defence needed surgery.

Green made some decent saves, particularly in the first half when he got down quickly to save from Carlos Sanchez when the Villa midfielder plucked the ball out of the sky.

At least this is a start, building from the back as Redknapp restructures a team with limited ambitions.

Staying in the Premier League is achievable and Rangers’ manager has done it before, miraculously, with Portsmouth back in 2006.

Next up for Rangers is Chelsea, a short journey across town to Stamford Bridge and a date with the League leaders on Saturday afternoon. Good luck with that.

A couple of seasons ago, when Redknapp had replaced Mark Hughes as manager of this team, they went to Chelsea and famously came away with a 1-0 win. Shaun Wright-Phillips scored the only goal.

The renaissance began here and this QPR team will come to rely on Green in the turbulent weeks and months ahead.

Without him, there would be no defence for this QPR team.
