Diego Costa may be Chelsea's star striker but he has well and truly misfired in this season's Champions League.

Chelsea were knocked out of the last-16 on away goals on Wednesday night after the tie against PSG finished 3-3 on aggregate.

And yet again it was another barren night for Costa, who has failed to score a single goal in seven Champions League appearances - a total of eight hours and 28 minutes of action - this season.

It pales into comparison with the Brazilian-born Spain striker's Premier League goalscoring record of 17 goals in 21 appearances.

Costa has averaged 2.4 shots per game in the Premier League, while he could only manage 1.7 in Europe's premier club competition.

The 26-year-old's domestic shooting accuracy (shots on target) is 68 per cent, which beats his European figure of 50 per cent.

Costa's failure to score in the competition this season is all the more remarkable when you consider how influential he was in Atletico Madrid's run to the final last year.

He scored eight goals in nine Champions League appearances last season and finished as the competition's third highest scorer.

In general, Costa's cup record for Chelsea has been poor, also failing to score in one FA Cup and three Capital One Cup appearances.

Some, including the man himself, have argued that he deserves credit for Chelsea's second goal in their 2-0 win over Tottenham Hotspur in the Capital One Cup final but it was officially given as a Kyle Walker own goal after a deflection.

It aptly sums up his woes for Chelsea in the cup competitions this year.
