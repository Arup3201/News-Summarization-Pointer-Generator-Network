All those tournament victories and great days at the majors, all those fabulous rounds he’s played over the years when he seemingly had the ball on the end of a string.

Never once, though, since turning professional in 2007 had Rory McIlroy enjoyed the satisfaction of a hole in one. Until Friday.

He threw his arms into the air, like a joyous footballer, after his nine-iron shot to the 177-yard, par-three 15th bounced twice before dropping gently into the hole for his first ace in competition.

23 under par rounds

96 under par in total

19 rounds in the 60s

104 birdies

27 bogeys

1 hole-in-one

After missing easy birdie putts at the previous two holes, McIlroy said: ‘It certainly made up for those misses. I knew it had a chance when I saw where it landed, and it took a nice hop to the right and dropped in. My first ace as a pro, so obviously the beers are on me tonight.’

McIlroy had his first hole in one aged nine, also with a nine iron, although back then it travelled 106 yards. He’d had eight since but only with his mates and, once, in a pro-am.

Perhaps it is surprising he’s had to wait so long for an ace in competition, but McIlroy knows some great players never achieve one. The late Seve Ballesteros, for example.

‘Obviously there’s some skill involved but there’s also a lot of luck,’ said McIlroy. ‘When you look at some of the players who have never had one, it was nice to get one out here.’

The perfect shot formed part of a back-nine charge that has left the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship with the sort of leaderboard that reads like an answered prayer for the sponsor.

Course specialist Martin Kaymer, three times a winner round here, is in pole position to win again after following his opening 64 with a 67. When he finished around lunchtime he was five clear and the tournament had the feel of a procession.

McIlroy changed all that, as did the gifted young Belgian Thomas Pieters. Indeed, but for a bogey on his final hole, the big-hitting 22-year-old from Antwerp would have finished on the same mark as Kaymer. His Yorkshire coach Pete Cowen reckons he will be among the world’s best in a couple of years and what an experience awaits him over the final two rounds.

Not only Kaymer for company, but McIlroy is just two off the lead after a marvellous back nine completed in 31 shots. If his opening 67 was achieved with a little smoke and mirrors, this 66 was more like the real McIlroy.

His ball-striking was back to its prodigious best and he bludgeoned poor Rickie Fowler into submission, for instance, as the American tumbled to a 75.

‘I’m not sure I could find any fault with my game from tee to green,’ said McIlroy. ‘I even hit a lot of good putts but they didn’t go in. But I’m in a great position and you could hardly ask for anything better for your first tournament of the year than chasing a two-time major champion on a course he loves. It will be hard to catch Martin round here, but I will be giving it my best.’

Kaymer showed his front- running qualities when he walked away from the field to claim the US Open last June. A tussle between the two men who have won the last three majors, then. It’s hard to beat that, isn’t it?

Meanwhile, on the PGA Tour at the Sony Open in Hawaii, Paul Casey shot a first-round 62 and then revealed he has resigned from the European Tour after 17 years as a member, thus making him ineligible to play in the Ryder Cup.

Casey, 37, who became a father last year, said: ‘For as long as I have been a professional I have been a member of the European Tour, so it was a very tough decision. But I live in Arizona and playing in America full-time will enable me to spend more time at home with Pollyanna (his wife) and Lex (his son).’
