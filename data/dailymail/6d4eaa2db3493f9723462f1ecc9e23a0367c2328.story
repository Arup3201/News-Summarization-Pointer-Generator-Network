The Liberal Democrats have been dismissed as 'naive or reckless' by the Conservatives for demanding a huge downgrade in Britain's nuclear deterrent.

The Trident missile system could take weeks to launch under Lib Dem proposals for the country to take a ‘step down the nuclear ladder’.

Tory Defence Secretary Philip Hammond warned the plan failed to take account of possible future threats from Iran, North Korea and Russia.

Ageing: The Trident fleet will come to the end of its life in the mid-2020s but the Government is committed to replacing it

Treasury Chief Secretary Danny 
Alexander has drawn up Lib Dem plans to cut the number of Trident submarines 
from four to two – and send them to sea without nuclear warheads.

A leaked document reveals that the party plans to have just ‘one submarine in a state of readiness measured in weeks’ while the other is being used for training or undergoing maintenance.

But Mr Hammond said there was no way of knowing who Britain's future enemies will be, and warned Russia, Iran and North Korea could all pose threats up to 2060.

He told BBC Radio 4: 'I think it’s frankly either naïve or reckless just because we don’t perceive an immediate threat today doesn’t mean there won’t be a threat over the 60-odd year time horizon we’re looking at here.

'We've got countries like Iran and North Korea attempting to build nuclear weapons and already possessing long-range missiles.

'We can’t say who the potential adversary might be in the future – Russia is investing $150billion in renewing its forces, we can’t say where the threats will come from.

'We have had for 45 years now a continuous at-sea defence posture that has served this country very well and we do not believe that with nuclear threats if anything proliferating, with more countries seeking to get nuclear weapons, this is a time to downgrade, certainly not to go to a part-time deterrent.'

The Trident fleet is designed so at least one submarine is continuously at sea so that Britain’s enemies know it could retaliate if attacked.

Both the Tories and Labour back Trident’s renewal in the 2020s.

But Mr Alexander used a speech today at the Royal United Services Institute to reveal the results of a Lib Dem study on the next generation of Trident subs.

He argued that the UK should save money because it no longer needs a Cold War-type defence posture.

He acknowledged it would mean accepting a 'different calculation of risk' but said he believed such a change was now justified.

'If continuous-at-sea deterrence is an insurance policy, we're paying too high a premium for our needs,' he said.

'The argument that a current adversary would take the opportunity to target the UK during a period when no boat is covertly deployed and launch an overwhelming nuclear strike against Britain is, frankly, not supported by any analysis I have seen.

He added: 'This is the ultimate guarantee we often talk about. But the reality is that in the current circumstances - and for the foreseeable future - that guarantee does not need to sit on a hair trigger.'

The Liberal Democrat Trident Policy document reveals the party is ‘wholly unconvinced’ the UK needs its existing fleet and envisages a future government issuing ‘a declaratory policy of going to sea with unarmed missiles’ – meaning subs would have to return to base in the event of an international crisis to get the necessary armaments.

And, in a clear sign that the Lib Dems want to abolish Britain’s nuclear arsenal altogether, the leaked paper argues that the UK should start ‘identifying a long-term exit route’ from their ownership.

‘Surely we now have an opportunity at least to “step down the nuclear ladder”,’ the document states.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said he hoped the report would 
open a 'fact-based debate' on Trident, ahead of the key decisions on the
submarine replacement programme due to be taken in 2016, after the 
general election.

'It clearly shows that there are options for our country that do not 
simply involve us sticking to the same strategic positions that were 
taken in the Cold War,' he said.

But he was slapped down by Downing Street who insisted David Cameron was committed to retaining the full deterrent.

'The Prime Minister believes in continuous at-sea deterrence. It is as simple as that,' Mr Cameron's official spokesman said.

'He has seen no evidence that there are credible alternatives.'

Mr Alexander mapped out the plan for two Trident submarines after the Lib Dems’ preferred option – cruise missiles mounted on ships, subs and aircraft – was comprehensively junked by Ministry of Defence officials as ruinously expensive.

The Lib Dem document admits: ‘Alternative systems, such as cruise missiles in tactical submarines or surface vessels, or air-launched systems, were found to be technically viable but very expensive.’ Defence experts last night rubbished the plan as liable to leave Britain open to attack.

Labour peer Lord West, the former First Sea Lord, told the Mail: ‘I find this extraordinary.

The reason we picked  this system [Trident] was because it is undetectable and almost invulnerable.

‘These plans are a mechanism for making something invulnerable very vulnerable. Once you have to come back to fit warheads, or spend long periods lying alongside, it gives your enemies the chance to kill your deterrent.’

A Conservative source said: ‘Deploying a so-called nuclear deterrent without nuclear warheads wouldn’t deter anyone. 

‘We’d have submarines rusting away in port doing nothing, protecting nothing and vulnerable to a first-strike attack. 

‘It would be a massive gamble with our national security.’
