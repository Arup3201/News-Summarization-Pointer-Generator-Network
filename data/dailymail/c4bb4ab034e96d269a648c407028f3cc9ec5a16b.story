Two weeks after an air show appearance was canceled due to engine problem, one of the last two remaining airworthy Canadian World War Two Lancaster bombers is up and running and set to make further appearances, starting from today.

The Lancaster, currently on a UK tour, suffered mechanical issues ahead of the Bournemouth Air Festival in August and engineers had to replace an engine, incurring huge costs and cancellations of appearances  around the country.

But now, Action Stations, the company who arrange for flight fans to fly along side the Lancaster -  and with the Canadian Warplane Museum - will run extra flights, allowing aviation enthusiasts the chance to see her fly from the sky once more.

The first of these flights will take place today from Bournemouth Airport – and more flights will be announced in the coming days due to demand.

The repaired Lancaster bomber arrived at Bournemouth Airport yesterday, along with the last remaining airworthy RAF Lancaster.

The two planes will be stationed in Bournemouth while they take part in scheduled appearances at the Duxford Air Show in Cambridgeshire and the Goodwood Revival event in West Sussex. 

After successful flights with the Lancaster at Humberside, the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum (CWHM) the owners and operators of Vera, agreed to organise further flights today and potentially other dates according to demand.

'A spectacular avaiation experience': The glorious Canadian Lancaster Bomber in flight

Attendees to the Goodwood Revival this coming weekend, will get the chance to see the Lancaster fly out of Bournemouth airport - and even fly alongside her.

These flights, which take place in an Action Stations aircraft not only give enthusiasts the chance of a lifetime to photograph the Lancaster in flight – they give a real financial boost contributing towards running costs.

Flights alongside the Canadian bomber cost £2,150 and include a 40-minute flight - flying alongside the Lancaster for about 30 minutes - as well as a tour of the plane and a photo opportunity.

Stephen Burt, CEO of Action Stations, said: 'We offer these flights to ensure the memory of those aircrews who gave of themselves in our hour of need, is never forgotten.

'Flying with the Lancaster was the most spectacular aviation experience that I have ever undertaken - to sail through the sky with this giant of an aeroplane was truly inspiring and make's one appreciate the skill , bravery of the aircrews who flew her, mainly at night, often under fire from both enemy aircraft and the ground.

'Like the Spitfire she is a legend in her time, and this 'one off' opportunity to fly with her shouldn't be missed!

In August, MailOnline Travel was given exclusive access to film the Avro Lancaster Mk X, which this month made the 14-hour, 3,700-mile journey to Britain for the last time. 

The four-minute tribute video shows the bomber taking off from Humberside Airport, flying down to Lincoln Cathedral, then out towards the North Sea and over The Lincolnshire Aviation Heritage Museum - home of the Avro Lancaster Just Jane.

The Canadian Lancaster, with a magnificent 102ft wingspan, looks haunting and glorious, its distinctive markings shimmering in the sunlight, as the plane - one of the Second World War's most-recognisable British aircraft - powers across the blue sky.  

More than 7,377 Lancasters, 430 of which were built in Canada, were built during the Second World War but many that survived were scrapped.

It was the most successful bomber used by the Royal Air Force and the Royal Canadian Air Force.
