Authorities in Oklahoma have confirmed that human remains found in a remote, wooded area are those of a 16-year-old girl who was reported missing in October of 2012.

The remains, later identified to be those of JaRay Mickell Wilson, were found buried in a wooded area near the Weatherford airport on December 7, 2013.

Ten days after the remains were discovered, authorities with the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics - acting on a tip - arrested 19-year-old Tucker Ryan McGee and charged him with first-degree murder.

Wilson was reported missing October 15, 2012, the station KFOR-TV reported.

The medical examinerâ€™s office will now analyze the remains to determine the cause of death.

A source told The Oklahoman that the young girl, a resident of Weatherford, was shot in the head before being dumped off a county road not far from her family home. 

Mark Woodward, a spokesman for the OBN, said McGee was questioned and sent to the Custer County jail.

Records show that the 19-year-old, who was Facebook friends with Wilson, pleaded guilty to a drug charge in March and was put on unsupervised probation.

According to investigators, JaRay's death may have been related to drugs of human trafficking, and they said more arrests are possible.
