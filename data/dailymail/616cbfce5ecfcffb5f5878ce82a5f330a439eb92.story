Shootout: The Marion County home is where Ma Barker, the mother of several gangsters, was killed alongside her son Fred

Bullet holes mark the walls of the Marion County home where Ma Barker, mother to several of the US government's most wanted gangsters, breathed her last breath.

Now county tax collector and former state legislator George Albright wants to turn the preserved home into a museum dedicated to the era of public enemies.

'Everything is like it was — it's almost like it happened yesterday, from bullet holes in the walls and the furniture,' Ocklawaha resident Charlene Yarborough told News 13. 

On January 16, 1935, FBI agents surrounded the house, located on Lake Weir, killing gangster Fred Barker and his mother after an hours-long shootout.

Fred was founder of the notorious Barker-Karpis gang, of which his brother Arthur 'Doc' Barker was also a member, that was responsible for a string of high-profile kidnappings in the 1930s.

After Alvin Karpis was declared Public Enemy Number 1 in 1934, the FBI arrested Doc and found a map showing where his brother and mother were hiding out.

Agents were tipped off to the rented home by mention of a one-eyed alligator named Old Joe, which lived in Lake Weir, and was known to neighbors. 

According to the book Touched by the Sun, the agents emptied thousands of bullets into the home, then sent local handyman Willie Woodbury in with a bulletproof vest. 

Scene: Bullet holes still mark the walls of the Florida site of the shootout, which took place between Fred Barker and 14 agents from the FBI back in 1935

Woodbury entered and confirmed no one inside was alive. The book Haunting Sunshine notes that Fred was riddled with 14 bullets, his mother, was killed with one shot. 

Neighbors watched the shootout, and Albright said his grandfather hid behind a tree to witness the gun battle.

According to Albright, his grandfather split his pants while crouching, but had enough time to buy replacements before catching the end of the shootout.

Wanted: Fred Barker, one of the founders of the Barker-Karpis gang that committed bank robberies and high-profile kidnappings, was found riddled with 14 bullets after firing on FBI agents

Matron: Ma Barker, also known by the names Arrie and Kate, was turned into a gangster in popular mythology, though role in the criminal undertakings of her sons is believed to be insignificant

'This was one of the watershed moments, Jan. 16, 1935, where the FBI, the good guys won,' Albright said. 

Albright, who was once caretaker of the property, has submitted a $1million proposal to buy the home from its Miami owners and convert it into a museum.

State legislators are expected to decide on the proposal in the spring.

'The condition is wonderful,' Albright said. 'This is a perfect property to showcase the gun battle itself, the rise and the fall of the gangster movement and the rise of the FBI and their successes.'

'It’s still a defining event in American history and it deserves to be protected,' he added.
