AFC Wimbledon will refuse to cash in on their dream FA Cup tie against Liverpool with a decision taken to fix ticket prices at League Two levels, between £4 and £25.

It is a refreshing change in the world where prices at the elite level have smashed through the £100 barrier and adheres to the true spirit of the competition, in keeping with a fixture that will evoke memories of the 1988 final.

Wimbledon are exploring the possibility of installing temporary seating at Kingsmeadow ground but there is very little scope to boost the capacity of 4,720. It means gate receipts after VAT will be around £60,000, which has to be shared with Liverpool and the FA.

They will bank £144,000 if the game, to be played on or just after the weekend of January 3-4, is among the five selected for live TV broadcast.

But more than the cash windfall, which will boost their transfer and wage budget of £1.1million, the tie marks an emotional step in the rebirth of a club lost when the FA sanctioned the former owners’ plan to move to Milton Keynes and rebrand as MK Dons.

‘It is a significant milestone in the development of the club,’ said executive Erik Samuelson. ‘You can look back to the time of our first trials on Wimbledon Common when we had no players or kit. When you think of where we’ve come from it makes the hairs on your neck stand up.

‘There was the first competitive game and our first game in the FA Vase, playing a Football League team in the FA Cup, promotion to the Conference, getting our own ground and getting back into the Football League and winning in Buckinghamshire.’

This is a reference to MK Dons. The relationship remains prickly, even after recent cup ties. 

The patrimony of the 1988 FA Cup win initially went to Milton Keynes with the team — but has since been passed to Merton Borough Council, following a campaign by the Wimbledon Independent Supporters Club. A miniature replica of the famous trophy resides in a library.

Occasionally it is loaned to AFC Wimbledon, who are attempting to move back into Merton. There are several hoops to get through but they hope to be there for the 2017-18 season.

‘This will be the first time we have had a competitive game against a Premier League team,’ added Samuelson. 

‘It’s another tick in another box except emotionally, it’s much more than that. It is a significant step. It has huge resonance because of 1988, when a massive number of our fans would have been at Wembley or watching on television.

'Isn’t that great? To complete the circle would be to beat them, but this fixture alone puts the club into the spotlight and reminds everyone who we are. It’s what the FA Cup is all about.’

This sentiment is the main factor in the club’s determination not to fleece fans over tickets, even though they could sell perhaps 10 times the capacity.

Adult prices will start at £16 for the terraces, up to £25 in the main stand, with £10 for concessions and £4 for U18s.

‘We will look into the possibility of expanding the capacity with temporary seats but the design of the ground makes it difficult,’ said Samuelson. ‘It is a challenge on and off the pitch. What we really need is a new stadium, somewhere in Merton. Wouldn’t that be nice?’
