A mother sobbed in the dock yesterday after she admitted killing her three disabled children at the £2million family home.

But Tania Clarence, 42, denied murder, instead accepting the lesser charge of manslaughter by diminished responsibility over the deaths of four-year-old Olivia and three-year-old twins Ben and Max.

Her husband Gary refused to look at her as she entered her Old Bailey plea in hardly more than a whisper. The 43-year-old investment banker was in South Africa with their eldest child at the time of the tragedy.

Tania Clarence, 42, sobbed in the dock at the Old Bailey as she pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Olivia, four, and three-year-old twins Ben and Max (pictured above with father Gary) by diminished responsibility

Overcome with emotion, his wife was barely audible as she uttered the words: ‘Not guilty to murder but guilty to manslaughter.’

The
 three children were found dead at their five-bedroom home by the 
family’s devoted nanny on April 22. They were in their pyjamas in bed 
and are believed to have been smothered. All three suffered from spinal 
muscular atrophy, a genetic condition sometimes described as ‘floppy 
baby syndrome’.

It leaves children with little control of their movements and can drastically shorten life expectancy.

Mrs Clarence is thought to have found that Olivia had the degenerative condition when she became pregnant with the twins.

The
 couple moved to New Malden, Surrey last year and spent around £1million
 adapting their home to cater for their disabled children, fitting a 
lift and ramps.

The bodies of the children were found at the couple's £2million family home (above) in New Malden, south-west London, on April 22. All three were in their pyjamas in bed and are believed to have been smothered to death

Gary Clarence (pictured attending an earlier court hearing in Wimbledon in April) was in South Africa with the couple's eldest child when the deaths occurred. He attended court but refused to look at his wife

Mrs Clarence
 gave up her job as a graphic designer to care for the trio. Friends 
said the children, who suffered severe breathing problems, had to be fed
 through tubes and were given medicine hourly.

Following
 the discovery of their bodies, Mrs Clarence was taken to hospital in 
Tooting for treatment to cuts before being charged by police on April 
24.

Her husband, who works 
for the City bank Investec, was in his native South Africa to visit 
relatives with eldest child Taya Grace, eight, who is not affected by 
the illness.

Yesterday the 
prosecution asked for more time for an expert psychiatrist to consider 
the case and Judge Mr Justice Nicol granted an adjournment until October
 3.

The defendant was remanded to a secure hospital for assessment.

Prosecutors
 are expected to indicate at the next hearing in October whether they 
will accept the manslaughter plea entered by Mrs Clarence or whether she
 should face trial for murder.

She waved at relatives and friends in the public gallery during the 15-minute hearing before being led away by the guards.

A provisional trial date has been set for next February.
