Attack: Children's football manager Aaron Cooper headbutted a rival coach during a crunch game

The manager of a children's football team attacked a rival coach and headbutted him in a touchline brawl sparked by a 'dodgy decision' from a 15-year-old referee.

Aaron Cooper, manager of Poole Town in Dorset, has been given a suspended sentence for assaulting opposite number Shaun Taylor during a match against Grange Athletic.

The teenage referee had to lead the 13-year-old footballers off the field in tears while their coaches fought, Bournemouth Crown Court heard.

Cooper, 34, and his assistant lost their tempers when the referee awarded a last-minute free kick to Grange Athletic during the crunch game, with the score at 1-1.

Mr Braggington pushed Mr Taylor and Cooper joined in, headbutting his opponent so hard the victim needed hospital treatment for a nasty wound to his mouth.

The fight forced the teenage referee to abandon the game before leading the players, some of whom were crying, off the pitch in the village of West Moors.

Cooper, a father of four, was given a seven-month suspended prison sentence after pleaded guilty to causing actual bodily harm during the incident last March.

Stuart Ellacott, prosecuting, said: 'What seems to have been the catalyst was a free kick awarded just outside the Poole Town area.

'Mr Bragginton accepts he pushed Mr Taylor first, then was pushed as he turned away. These two gentlemen were supposed to be setting an example for the under-13s.

'There was a scuffle with both scrabbling on the floor. The defendant then stepped forward and headbutted the victim leaving him with a mouth injury which needed stitches in hospital.'

Mr Braggington and Mr Taylor were also arrested following the fight, but were released without charge.

The court heard that Cooper told police that tensions were high because the clash between the two sides had been 'a really vital game' in the Bournemouth Youth Football League.

Nicholas Robinson, defending, said Cooper regretted that the fight had been witnessed by children, adding that he now faces a lifetime ban from coaching by the FA.

He said: 'I know the court will feel [a ban] is quite right but he is passionate about football and passionate about helping children in the teams he has volunteered with. This is a massive punishment for him.'

Judge Jonathan Fuller said the 'unseemly brawl' was 'wholly unacceptable', telling the defendant: 'You should feel ashamed of yourself.'

Cooper, from Poole, was ordered to complete 150 hours of unpaid work and pay £400 compensation to Mr Taylor.

He will now be subject to a disciplinary procedure from the Dorset FA, and could be banned from football.

A spokesman said: 'Aaron Cooper was suspended pending the police enquiry which has now concluded. Now we can deal with the disciplinary matter. This case is very unusual and not something we have ever seen before.'
