Feel like you're stuck behind your desk? It seems you're not alone.

Unpaid overtime has become a fact of life for one in four British employees, who clock up at least seven hours over their contracted working time each week.

The culture of staying late has become so common that more than a third of those questioned in research by health insurer AXA PPP said they felt guilty if they left the office on time.

Too much work was given as the main reason for doing overtime, with 40 per cent citing it, while 20 per cent said they stayed late because of pressure from colleagues.

More than one in 10 (11 per cent) of those workers questioned said they remained in the office because they were afraid they might lose their job if they didn't clock up extra hours.

While businesses might be feeling the benefits of employees' extra efforts now, the study authors warned they could be doing long-term harm.

Dr Mark Winwood, director of psychological services at AXA PPP, said: 'It's concerning to see so many people working extra hours due to pressures in their workplace.

'If a business encourages a culture of long hours where workers feel they need to stay late, they may be doing themselves a disservice.

'Protracted working hours can dent an employee's productivity and even lead to burnout. This is an issue employers would be wise to address.'

He warned that employers also have a legal duty of care to safeguard the health and well-being of their staff and therefore should ensure that they have a clear policy on overtime and make sure workers follow it.

'Employers should also invest in ensuring that staff know what support services are available to help them if they are struggling to manage the pressures in their lives, whether at work or at home - for example, confidential counselling helplines,' said Dr Winwood.

'If not, they may find themselves on the receiving end of a work-related personal injury claim and/or up before an employment tribunal.

'Overtime is too often worn as a badge of honour and seen by employees as a requirement for success. Senior management has a critical role to play in challenging this widely held view and, by demonstrating strong leadership, can help to foster a workplace culture where employees are treated fairly and greater emphasis is placed on effective performance management rather than on simply being seen to be putting in long hours.'

The study of 2,000 employees found that less than half of those doing overtime get paid for it and that one in ten staff work through their lunch.
