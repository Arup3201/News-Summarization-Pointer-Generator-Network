The bodies of a lesbian couple have been found behind a dumpster after one was beaten to death and the other was fatally shot, authorities have said.

Britney Cosby and Crystal Jackson, both 24, left their home in Houston, Texas on Wednesday night for a trip to Galveston - which is 50 miles south - in their new car.

But their families did not hear from them and at 7.30am on Friday, a delivery man found their bodies near a dumpster outside a convenience store in Port Bolivar, just north of Galveston.

Detectives believe the women were killed elsewhere and then dumped at the store, KHOU reported.

The Galveston County Medical Examiner's Office concluded that Cosby died from the result of blunt force trauma while Jackson was killed by a gunshot wound, KTRK reported.

It is unclear whether the incident was an anti-gay hate crime but police are not ruling it out.

Suspect: Detectives are looking for a man in his late 20s or early 30s seen in the couple's car

The couple had been together for two years and lived together.

Jackson, a barista at Starbucks, was the mother of a five-year-old. Cosby worked as a security guard.

'That was her girlfriend, that was her soulmate,' one of Cosby's neighbor's, James Randle, told ABC.

On Valentine's Day, Jackson wrote a Facebook message to Cosby beneath a photo of them together.

'Words can't explain 
how u make me feel,' she wrote.

'From the moment we met, I just knew u was the one 
for me, through all the tears, laughter, the good and bad, I still love u
 always and forever.'

Investigators are now searching for Cosby's vehicle, a silver 2006 Kia Sorrento with paper tags, and on Sunday, they released a composite sketch of the suspect who was reportedly seen driving the car.

The suspect is described as a black male with an average build, standing between 5 feet 11 inches and 6 feet tall and in his late 20s or early 30s.

Authorities ask that anyone with any information calls the local sheriffâ€™s office tip line at 866-248-8477 or Galveston County Crime Stoppers 409-763-8477.

'Just come forward, just to give us closure as a family,' Cosby's sister McDade Cosby told KTRK. 'Just come forward, because we need closure at this point.'
