Facebook and YouTube could be to blame
for the spread of the mystery Tourrette’s-like illness that is 
blighting a town in upstate New York.

Doctors said that symptoms are being 
‘reinforced and magnified’ because victims of the bizarre condition are 
uploading videos of themselves onto social networking sites to appeal 
for help.

They argue that when other people in 
the town of LeRoy view the videos, they are unconsciously mimicking what
they see and spreading it around.

Lori Brownell, 16, posted a video on YouTube showing the Tourettes-like
symptoms she has suffered since August. She is one of 15 at LeRoy High 
School in New York State who have developed the mystery condition

The true cause of the illness is still
a mystery and there no formal suggestion that Facebook or any of the 
other social networking websites are to blame.

But David Lichter, professor of 
neurology at the University of Buffalo, who has treated several of the 
patients, said he might now understand how it has affected so many 
people.

He told MSNBC: ‘It's remarkable to see
how one individual posts something, and then the next person who posts 
something not only are the movements bizarre and not consistent with 
known movement disorders, but it's the same kind of movements.

‘This mimicry goes on with Facebook or YouTube exposure. This is the modern way that symptomology could be spread.’

In total 19 patients have come forward
with Tourette’s like symptoms since last Fall, which include 
uncontrollable facial and body twitching.

Trying to understand: Thera Sanchez, 17, has had
the mysterious symptoms for months and all of the treatments he has 
received have not helped to clarify any options for her or her family

They include 14 girls aged between 13 
and 18 and this week the first adult victim, 36-year-old nurse 
practitioner Marge Fitzsimmons.

Among those who have taken an interest in the case is environmental campaigner Erin Brockovich.

She has suggested that a chemical 
spill from a train derailment in the 1970s near the site of the girls’ 
school may be the cause.

Researchers have also come up with a 
string of theories and believe teenagers may have been struck down by 
paediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome, or PANS, which is a 
kind of OCD linked to strep throat.

Other believe that Morgellons could be to blame, which is a disease that causes patients to sprout painful sores.

Some doctors have also suggested it 
could be a mass psychogenic illness which can be triggered by stress and
is spread from unconscious mimicry of one another.

Dr. Laszlo Mechtler, chief of 
neurology at the Dent Neurologic Institute in Buffalo, said: ‘When one 
has a symptom, it can be reinforced and magnified with other individuals
with similar symptoms.

‘That's what's going on with these 
girls. They are in a segregated small rural town in New York state. They
are a cohesive group. And this wildfire of symptoms takes control.’

During an angry meeting on Saturday 
parents berated LeRoy schools officials and asked why the soil around 
natural gas well which had been dug on school ground had not been tested
for contamination.

Demanding explanations: Parents gathered for a meeting with school administrators to determine what was being done to ensure the safety of students near the 1970 chemical spill

Patrick Frauley (left) and Beth Miller (right, whose daughter is one of the ill teens, spoke at the meeting

'This could take years! What are you doing to protect my kid? What are you doing to protect these peoples kids?' said parent Patrick Frauley.

Many of the parents of the sick teens attended the meeting, but none of the teens themselves were present.

'I'm not looking for a lawsuit of any kind, I just want my daughter to get better,' said Beth Miller.

Adding to the concern was that the 
wells were drilled using the controversial hydraulic fracturing method, 
also known as ‘fracking’.

Dr Greg Young of the New York State 
Department of Health had earlier explained that tests had ruled out 
environmental factors as the cause of the disease.

He also claimed that genetics, antihistamines or head trauma could be to blame.
