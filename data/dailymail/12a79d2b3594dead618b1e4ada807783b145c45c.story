It's not the exotic charms of a modern-day Mata Hari that will make a good secret agent, but feminine characteristics such as understanding emotions

Women spies have often been depicted as practised seducers – able to prise secrets from defenceless men with their devastating charm.

But, according to one female intelligence officer, there’s a rather more ordinary reason why women make better spies than men – they appear less threatening.

So it’s not the exotic charms of a modern-day Mata Hari that will make a good secret agent, but feminine characteristics such as understanding emotions.

They are the qualities that make women ‘bloody good spies’ a female MI6 officer said yesterday as part of a drive by the Security Service to recruit more women.

The spy, speaking anonymously, said working mothers made particularly good secret agents. She said: ‘Being a mother and a spy can also be an advantage because it enables you to connect with a whole range of people from terrorists to political leaders.

‘I’m less of a threat than a single female,’ said the intelligence officer who is married with young children. ‘They, the terrorist, have mothers, sisters, daughters.’

After taking six months maternity leave when she had her children, she said life as a working mother is difficult.

‘It is amazing that anybody manages to balance life and work with small children.’

She added that the thing that upsets her the most is hearing her children cry when dropping them off at nursery. She said her gender has been helpful as she worked to protect the world from the threat of terrorism or nuclear war.

‘I have successfully countered proliferation,’ she added. ‘I’ve made the world a safer place through some of the jobs I have done and the agents I have run.‘

It is always interesting, there is 
massive diversity. You can be covering completely different geographic 
locations over a career. There’s strong moral reward to it.’

The spy said life at MI6 is far from the glamorous world depicted in James Bond films, starring Daniel Craig and Judi Dench

The spy said life at MI6 is far from the glamorous world depicted in James Bond films.

‘SIS is a lot more responsible and it is a lot more connected to the rest of government. It is a lot more about teamwork and not just Bond talks to Q and gets kit.’

Asked if she has ever been armed with an 
explosive pen, she said: ‘No, though I have had pens that explode on a 
plane because of cabin pressure.’

Throughout the decades the idea of the female spy has captured the imagination. Mata Hari was an exotic dancer and courtesan who was convicted of being a spy, and executed by firing squad in France under charges of espionage during the First World War.

Two high profile women have reached the top in the spying game. Dame Stella Rimington was director general of MI5 in 1992 and used her knowledge to become a successful thriller author.

Dame Eliza Manningham-Buller was also a director general for MI5. Dame Eliza revealed she was nearly thrown out of a pub after being mistaken for a prostitute while training to be a spy.
