New details have emerged in the trial of Rutgers student Dharun Ravi, who is accused of bullying and intimidating his gay roommate to a point that he committed suicide.

Among the new evidence are details of the 25-year-old man what Tyler Clementi was videoed kissing bare chested in his dorm room.

Tyler is said to have mulled over bringing him to a hotel but did not want to spend $35 so brought him back to his dorm instead, despite fears Ravi might walk in on them.

Charged: Dharun Ravi, right, didn't bully his room mate Tyler Clementi before his suicide, according to defence lawyers

It was also revealed that Tyler's 
mother 'all but disowned him' when he came out to his parents a short 
time before he left for Rutgers University.

The court was also told that Ravi 
tried to apologise to his roommate after the alleged incident, texting 
him saying: 'I’ve known you were gay and I have no 
problem with it.

'I don’t want your freshman year to be 
ruined because of a petty misunderstanding, it’s adding to my guilt.'

But the shy violinist from Ridgewood had likely already killed himself by the time they were sent.

The text messages, instant messages and other documents emerged during the trial this week.

Regarding being caught by Ravi in his
dorm with the man, Tyler said in an instant message with a friend: 
'That would be so awk tho lol ... him walking in.'

Although Ravi, from Plainsboro, New 
Jersey, didn't walk in, he was allegedly using a webcam to watch the 
encounter from a different room and Tweeting about it.

Suicide: Tyler Clementi leaped off a bridge after discovering he had been filmed in a tryst with another man

A few days later, on September 22, 
Tyler, then 18, jumped off the George Washington Bridge in a suicide 
that made national headlines.

Talking about coming out to his 
parents, in another instant message with a friend, he said: 'It’s a good
thing dad is ok w/it or I would be in serious trouble/ mom has 
basically completely rejected me.'

According to the Star Ledger, details
of the growing tension between the roomates over his sexuality were 
revealed today in hundreds of pages of documents released in a court 
filing by Ravi’s attorney.

Ravi is charged with 15 counts 
including invasion of privacy and bias intimidation for targeting Tyler 
because of his sexual orientation.

His attorney has asked Superior Court Judge Glenn Berman to dismiss all charges against him.

If convicted on the most serious charges, Ravi - who is now 19 - could face up to ten years in prison.

According to the Star Ledger, the 
court also heard that the 19-year-old used his computer skills to deduce
his new roommate was gay as soon as Rutgers sent him his name.

He used Tyler’s e-mail address to learn he had frequented web pages for gay men.

Grieving: Tyler told his friend about coming out to his parents, Joe and Molly Clementi, saying his mum had rejected him

On an August 22 computer chat with a friend, he wrote: 'Most gay person I’ve ever seen.'

After they moved in together, the 
pair spent time in their room chatting on their computers with friends 
about their tense living arrangements.

Cooperating: Molly Wei, who was also implicated in bullying Clementi, has agreed to testify against Dharun Ravi

Tyler claimed Ravi would not change 
his clothes in front of him, writing in an instant message: 'He knows 
I’m gay and wow he changes his pants inside of his closet ... it’s the 
most awk thing you’ve ever seen.'

He also told a friend two days before
he committed suicide that he was not too bothered when he first learned
that Ravi had watched him on the webcam with the 25-year-old man.

He wrote: 'When I first read the tweet I defs felt
violated/ But then/ When I remembered what actually happened ... / Idk 
(I don’t know) ... /Doesn’t seem soooo bad lol.'

But he later reported the incident to
Rutgers officials and requested a new room after learning that Ravi 
tried to turn on the webcam a second time and sent a Twitter message out
telling people to watch.

Ravi also allegedly used other 
students' computers to check the angle of the webcam, according to 
investigators' testimony to the grand jury.

One student living in the dorm said Ravi wanted the webcam pointed at Tyler's bed.

Another female student said Ravi used her computer to check the camera was operational.
