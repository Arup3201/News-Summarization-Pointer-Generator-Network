With rockstar royalty Noel Gallagher for a father and IT girl Meg Mathews as a mother, it's little surprise that 14-year-old Anais was destined for a glittering career.

The youngster, who counts Kate Moss’ daughter Lila Grace and Sadie Frost’s daughter Iris as her best friends, is already making waves in the modelling world.

And now, Anais, who is signed to Select Model Management, has been unveiled as the face of Accessorize's new tween collection, STAR.

Fashion's new darling? Anais Gallagher, daughter of Noel Gallagher and Meg Mathews, has curated and modelled a tween jewellery range for Accessorize 

Anais,  the daughter of Oasis star Gallagher, has curated the range based on 'fun, novelty pieces with an on-trend edge'.

Speaking about her collaboration with the high street jewellery giant, she said: 'It’s exciting! It’s great to be part of the launch. I love Accessorize and the Star accessories really suit my style.'

Sharing her favourite part of styling the shoot, Anais, who went to the same school as Cara Delevingne, said: 'It was a chance to get creative and have fun with accessories - the shoot is very playful, just like the collection.'

The teen, who signed with Select  when she was 11, revealed her styling mantra to be: 'Don’t hold back – you can never wear too many accessories!'.

Despite landing this huge gig before her 16th birthday, Anais already has her sights set on bigger things.

Speaking to Grazia about her dream fashion coup, she said: 'Burberry! It’s one of the coolest brands and their campaigns are always really flawless and I personally love them. 

'I enjoy looking at them and the films they make. My mum did one when she was pregnant with me so I guess I’ve already done it but I’d like to do it when I can actually remember.'

Anais, who went to the same school as Cara Delevingne, even got to style the shoot herself

Anais says that she loves accessorising and you can never wear too many rings, necklaces and earrings 

It's not just in the fashion world that Anais is making a name for herself; she started her own TV career this year when she took over the style section of CBBC's Friday Download from Dionne Bromfield this May.

Anais offers low-budget and age-appropriate ways to update your look, reporting from her bedroom with tween tips on customising sunglasses with nail varnish and glitter and rocking a hair braid like Demi Lovato. 

There’s also a top-secret Brit movie coming this year in which she has a cameo.
