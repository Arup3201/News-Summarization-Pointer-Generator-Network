Craig Stockham, 33, (pictured) from Flintshire, abused his position as finance director at LiveWire and Culture Warrington to siphon thousands of pounds into his bank account to fund his drug habit

A finance boss stole nearly £30,000 of taxpayers' money to fund his £150-a-day cocaine habit, a court heard.

Craig Stockham abused his position as finance director of two non-profit organisations to siphon thousands of pounds of  into his own bank account.

The 33-year-old, from Flintshire, Wales, was caught out by colleagues on his last week of work at LiveWire and Culture Warrington, which provides and manages leisure services for Warrington Borough Council.

Halton Magistrates' Court, in Cheshire, heard how he stole about £28,670 from the organisations between January and November before using it to fund his cocaine habit.

Stockham, who was dressed in a grey suit, striped shirt and blue tie, admitted theft at the court hearing yesterday and the case was sent to Warrington Crown Court, where he will be sentenced at later date.

During the hearing, magistrates heard how Stockham was recently promoted to his senior role - which gave him access to funds and the responsibility of making strategic management decisions – after being taken on by the groups when they were founded in 2012.

He was set to receive a severance package after working his last day, on what would have been November 18, but was instead immediately suspended, without pay, just a few days prior after colleagues discovered missing funds.

It was only when a fellow colleague asked a worker to double check one of Stockham's payments that his actions come to light.

After investigating the payment further, the worker discovered that Stockham had made one payment to a separate bank account, which was found to be his own.

Following a review, it was found that he stole around £24,000 from LiveWire and £4,670 from Culture Warrington, the court heard.

LiveWire runs former council-owned Warrington leisure centre while Culture Warrington manages the Parr Hall and Warrington Museum.

When arrested on November 12, he tested positive for cocaine and police found paperwork in his room which showed that he was in debt.

Prosecuting, Alison Warburton, said: 'He had a cocaine habit, he was spending around £150 on cocaine a day.

'He had access to spending a lot of the budget. It is a very serious breach of trust.'

The companies insist appropriate financial systems and procedures were in place and have slammed the 'devastating' effects of Stockham's actions.

Speaking after yesterday's court hearing, Jan Souness, managing director for both LiveWire and Culture Warrington, said: 'As finance director, Craig was a trusted and valued member of our senior management team.

'He came to us with impeccable references and was a unanimous choice when he was appointed.

'He was popular among peers and was one of the original team.

'We worked hard to support each other and we thought there was strong trust and transparency among us.

'His actions had a devastating impact on the team in terms of his betrayal of his office, his colleagues, the board and the people of Warrington whom we in LiveWire and Culture Warrington endeavour to serve to the best of our ability.

'Whilst we are insured for the loss and so the impact on both companies in a material sense is minimal, it is the sense of betrayal that has been the hardest to cope with.

'I’m proud to say that the teams across both organisations have pulled together to ensure the continued high standards of service to our customers.' 

Defence barrister Nick Terry advised the magistrates to send the case to the crown court.

A date has not yet been fixed for sentencing.
