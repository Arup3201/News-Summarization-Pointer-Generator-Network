When it comes to choosing a home-grown apple, Peter Collett is spoilt for choice.

For the 83-year-old has 50 varieties growing on a single tree.

Mr Collett grafted buds from a range of apple plants on to an established specimen to produce the amazing tree.

He has a total of 130 types of apple in a half-acre garden in Tangmere, West Sussex, that he has spent the past 30 years cultivating, including some of the rarest and most historic English varieties.

He grows 30 other types of fruit including pears, plums, cherries, quince and pomegranate.

Mr Collett, whose produce has won awards, is a member of the Royal Horticultural Society Fruit Group Committee and judges RHS competitions. One of the rarest apples in his orchard is Ashmead’s Kernel, first grown in Gloucestershire in the 1700s. Other varieties never seen on supermarket shelves including Howgate Wonder, Red Devil, Laxton’s Epicure, Spartan and Crawley Beauty. Among the smallest he grows is Api Noir, which dates back to Roman times.

The retired headmaster first developed a love for apples during the Second World War when he spent his summer holidays picking fruit near his childhood home in Norfolk. ‘We were given extra-long holidays so that we could help bring in the fruit harvest,’ he said.

‘I started working on one particular fruit farm in 1943 and I returned there for the following six years because I loved it. My grandfather and great-grandfather were gardeners so it was in my blood. That first taste of ripe fruits at the peak of their perfection will remain with me for ever. I vowed I would one day achieve the same results. Britain has hundreds of varieties of apple and they are all particular to a certain area so I started to grow apple trees that came from areas that meant something to me.

Peter Collett marks each area of the tree with a tag (right) so that he knows which apple is which

‘I have apples from Norfolk where I grew up, from Hampshire where I was a teacher and from Sussex where I live now.’ He and his wife Jean, who have four children, three grandchildren and a great-grandson, eat the fruits of his labour raw, baked or in crumbles. Any left over get fed to his neighbour’s pigs, along with the windfalls. ‘It’s the most basic form of trade – and the sausages and bacon I get back are very tasty indeed,’ he said.
