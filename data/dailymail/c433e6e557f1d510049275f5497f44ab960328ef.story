Bomber: Marian McGlinchey admitted buying a mobile phone linked to a Real IRA attack in which two British soldiers died

Old Bailey bomber Marian McGlinchey yesterday admitted buying a mobile phone linked to a Real IRA attack in which two British soldiers died.

The 59-year-old was caught on CCTV buying the device – which was then used by the terror group to claim responsibility for an attack on the Massereene Army barracks in 2009.

Royal Engineer sappers Mark Quinsey and Patrick Azimkar were shot dead by gunmen as they stepped outside their compound in Antrim to collect a pizza from two delivery men.

Two other soldiers and two civilians were wounded when more than 60 shots were fired from a car at the servicemen, who were wearing desert fatigues and were due to be deployed to Afghanistan the next day.

In a dramatic change of plea, McGlinchey – also known as Marian Price – yesterday pleaded guilty to providing property for the purposes of terrorism.

Prosecutors told Belfast Crown Court that the pay-as-you-go handset she bought at a Tesco in Belfast had been provided ‘solely’ for the purposes of the dissident Republican Real IRA.

The court heard that the phone was first used an hour and five minutes after it was bought. The following day an unknown man made a number of calls to media outlets, said prosecutor Tessa Kitson. McGlinchey, who helped carry out the 1973 IRA car bomb attack on London’s Old Bailey courthouse, must have known the phone would be used to ‘promote the objectives and aims of a terrorist organisation’ because of her ‘background and involvement in dissident republican activity’, Miss Kitson said.

McGlinchey, from Belfast, also changed her plea and admitted a second charge of aiding and abetting a meeting to encourage support for terrorism. She was filmed holding a piece of paper for a masked man at a rally in Londonderry in 2011, at which he issued threats against Catholic police officers.

McGlinchey, who was returned to prison the same year on the direction of the then Northern Ireland Secretary Owen Paterson, was released on bail and will be sentenced next month.

McGlinchey and her sister Dolours Price were arrested at Heathrow hours after they were involved in placing bombs outside the Old Bailey in 1973. One man died of a heart attack and more than 200 people were injured. Later they both went on hunger strike in their battle to be transferred from jail in  England to Northern Ireland.

In the 1990s they became fierce critics of Sinn Féin and its president, Gerry Adams, calling his peace strategy a sell-out.
