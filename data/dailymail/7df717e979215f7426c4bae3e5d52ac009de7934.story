Michael Schumacher's 15-year-old son Mick has signed a contract with Van Amersfoort Racing to drive in the Formula 4, a series for young talents.

The Dutch team's owner Frits van Amersfoort says 'we have watched his skills in test driving and are looking forward to a successful season.'

Mick Schumacher finished second in the world, European and German kart championships last season. His father Michael is the most successful driver in Formula One history with seven titles.

Michael Schumacher suffered severe head injuries in a skiing accident in Meribel in the French Alps in December 2013. He was retired from F1 at the time of the accident.

Van Amersfoort Racing propelled Max Verstappen - son of Schumacher snr's 1994 Benetton F1 team-mate Jos - to prominence in Formula 3 last season.

Verstappen jnr, 17, will race for Toro Rosso in F1 in the 2015 season. 

'In the last couple of years, it has become a tradition for us that we offer the runner-up from the German junior karting championship a test session in our simulator,' added Van Amesfoort.

'This is handled by the DMSB, the German motorsport authority, and that is how we first got in touch with Mick Schumacher last autumn.

He spent a full day in the simulator at our headquarters in the Netherlands, then we witnessed him during a test session at Valencia and, eventually, we reached an agreement to compete together in this year's ADAC Formula 4 series.'

Michael Schumacher emerged from an induced coma in June last year, and left hospital in September.

He has since started to recognise family members, according to someone claiming to be a family friend.

Philippe Streiff, a former Formula One driver, told French media Schumacher 'has yet to recover the power of speech' but is 'nevertheless starting to recognise those close to him'.

However, Schumacher's manager has disputed the comments, saying the 46-year-old faces a 'long fight' for recovery and that Streiff is not a family friend. 

'We need a long time,' Sabine Kehm said. 'He is making progress appropriate to the severity of the situation. 

Mick Schumacher could follow the path of Max Verstappen, who also raced for Van Amersfoort Racing
