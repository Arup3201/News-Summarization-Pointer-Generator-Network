It is a crumbling relic of the Edwardian boom in seaside towns around the country - and was once the largest unsupported dome in the UK after St Paul’s Cathedral. But the Spanish City Dome in Whitley Bay, North Tyneside, is now at risk of languishing as a ruin after a restoration project has stalled due to lack of funds.

The Grade II listed building, which was built in 1910, fronted the Spanish City funfair for almost 100 years, and was due to be restored to its former glory by next year. But a project to restore the iconic 
building, which started in 2005, has been plagued by funding problems, 
and developers are now calling on local people to push through the bid 
for another £3.5million in lottery funding.

Despite
 being turned down for funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund in April 
this year, a further bid is being mounted for December this year - the 
next available round of funding. It
 was hoped the building would return to its former glory by 2014, 
putting the heart back into the seaside town, but no work has taken 
place on the dome for almost a year.

Robertson North East, the investment 
and construction company which won the bid to develop the site, is 
planning a family entertainment and cultural centre inside the dome. Architects
 have designed a 50-bed four-star boutique hotel, 20 apartments, a 
1950s-style diner and a pleasure garden. to populate the site.

Norma
 Redfearn, the mayor of North Tyneside, has also put out a plea for 
local residents to support the bid, which could help revitalise the 
town. The developers were initially awarded
 £2.4million from North Tyneside Council when the project began in 2005.
 This was followed by a further £2.2million in 2007, and £1.2million 
from the Coastal Communities Fund last year.

But despite the several rounds of funding already received, the project remains uncompleted and in desperate need of more funds. North
 Tyneside Council’s first bid was turned down in April and now the 
earliest the cash-strapped authority can get financial support is 
December, adding a further unwelcome delay.

Ms Redfearn said: 'I know how important the dome is to people in all areas of the borough, not just Whitley Bay. It holds a special place in their hearts evoking memories of childhood, wonderful days out and even romantic encounters. It’s extremely disappointing that the regeneration of the building has stalled and we were refused funding earlier in the year.

'As
 elected mayor I promise to listen to what residents had to say and 
that’s why I am asking them to help us to secure the dome’s future and 
show us how strongly they want the dome to be finished. I’m
 determined not to give up on it - it’s an iconic landmark, it’s part of
 our heritage but most of all it’s very important to local people.'

Local
 people have been urged to lobby the Heritage Lottery Fund by filling 
out postcards, forms and online petitions calling on the dome to be 
awarded financial support. Two
 open days to galvanise public support by demonstrating the dire 
condition of the dome has been arranged for Tuesday, September 24 and 
Tuesday, October 1.
