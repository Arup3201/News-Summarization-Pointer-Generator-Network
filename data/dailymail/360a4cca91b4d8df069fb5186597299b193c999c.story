A boy aged just 12 could have carried out a string of sex attacks around a university campus, police said.

They have released a computerised image, above, of the young suspect, which they said made the incidents ‘even more shocking’.

Officers are linking the assaults in the last month near the University of Manchester. The first two took place within 15 minutes of each other on September 21.

Greater Manchester Police have released an image of a 12-year-old boy who may be responsible for a string of sex attacks around a university campus

Appeal: Greater Manchester Police have asked for information about the attacks

A 27-year-old was grabbed before she screamed and scared the offender off. Then an Asian boy made lewd comments to a  21-year-old woman as she left a library before attacking her.

In the third attack, on October 5, a 32-year-old was approached by two Asian boys and assaulted by one. Detective Constable Pam Collins said the attacker also made violent threats to the women.

Detective Constable Pam Collins from Longsight Police Station said: 'After speaking to the women, we have managed to complete an evofit of the offender. As you can see from the image he looks fairly young which makes these assaults even more shocking.

'After each woman has told the offender to go away he has followed this up with violent threats so we are keen to find this individual as soon as possible.

'I would ask anyone who either recognises the image, witnessed any of the assaults or may have fallen victim to this person to call us.'

Anyone with information should phone police on 0161 856 4223 or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
