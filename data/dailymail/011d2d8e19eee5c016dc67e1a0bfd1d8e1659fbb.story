A nurse whose parked car was damaged by a football team's coach on Boxing Day was shocked to find two of the players laughing about the incident on Twitter.

One tweet, apparently posted by Watford FC striker Troy Deeney, showed a picture of the vehicle along with the words: 'Are (sic) coach driver just finished someone's Xmas lol'.

Majella Tarmey, 29, and her partner Duncan Butler, 32, were taking their one-year-old son Joseph to visit family in Bristol.

After finding fans' cars parked all along the road, Ms Tarmey said she asked a steward at Bristol City FC's Ashton Gate ground if they could park by a wall close to the stadium.

Scraped: Watford FC player Troy Deeney apparently tweeted this picture of the damage done to Majella Tarmey's car, while it was parked in Bristol on Boxing Day

Shocked: Ms Tarmey, a nurse, from Bedminster, Bristol, was taken by police officers onto the coach to exchange details with the driver

After visiting family they returned to the car at around 2pm to find police at the scene.

The couple were told that the coach carrying the Championship League team into the ground had hit Ms Tarmey's car.

They say it had been scraped along one side and the wheel arch damaged.

Ms Tarmey, a nurse, from Bedminster, Bristol, was taken by police officers onto the coach to exchange details with the driver.

Although upset, she was resigned to the damage caused in the incident, until she logged on to social networking service Twitter.

Ms Tarmey's partner had noticed tweets on the accounts of two Watford FC players - Troy Deeney and Fernando Forestieri - that had been retweeted by various people

Forestieri had also apparently tweeted a picture of the damaged car.

Alongside it were the words: 'Merry Christmas Bristol hahahahahaha.'

Ms Tarmey, who is a Bristol City fan, said: 'I was shocked when I read these comments on Twitter. It's not so much the accident that upset me but the attitude of the players.

'I feel that it is unacceptable for such public figures to behave in this manner.

'It may be hilarious to these highly paid individuals, but for me it is at great cost.

The post was found funny by other people who retweeted the images

'My car had to be recovered from the ground as it wasn't safe to drive and now the insurance company is looking into the damage and how much it's going to cost.

'We were going to take our son to see his grandparents in Southampton but have had to wait for a courtesy car to be delivered - it's really inconvenienced us.

'It was so irritating to read the flippant comments from the players - I am now in the process of making a complaint to the club.'

A spokeperson for Watford FC today declined to comment about the Boxing Day incident involving its team bus.

Watford FC striker Troy Deeney was jailed for 10 months at Birmingham Crown Court last June for his part in a street brawl
