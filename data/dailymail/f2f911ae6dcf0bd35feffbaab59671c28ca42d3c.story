Hundreds of Afghan soldiers have been removed from the ranks as part of an investigation into Taliban infiltration of the country's military.

The backgrounds of Afghan troops are being double-checked after 45 Coalition forces were killed in a surge of so-called 'green on blue' killings during the past year, the Afghan Defence Ministry has said. 

Britain and its allies are pushing for Afghan forces to take over security for the country by the end of 2014 but this is being undermined by the number of attacks by infiltrators.

At least 12 insider attacks have taken place in August alone, resulting in 15 deaths, with Seven Britons killed this year when Afghan security forces have turned on Western troops.

At the weekend, NATO said it was suspending training of Afghan police amid security concerns.

The killings are straining an alliance 
already stretched by a tense relationship with Afghanistan’s president, 
Hamid Karzai, and disagreements over NATO tactics that Kabul says 
endanger civilians.

NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh 
Rasmussen has expressed deep concern to Karzai over the growing number of
assaults by Afghan troops on coalition forces.

Plan: International soldiers are training and mentoring Afghan forces so they can assume responsibility for the country's security by the end of 2014. It means that Nato soldiers must work closely with the Afghan police they are training (stock picture)

Defense Ministry spokesman Mohammad 
Zahir Azimi would not give any figures for the number of soldiers 
removed - but said many of those affected had been pushed out because 
they had either incomplete or forged documents.

Azimi added that the investigation began
about six months ago but could provide no further details. He said more
information would be released next week.

NATO did not comment on Azimi's remarks.

Militants have infiltrated the ranks 
of the Afghan army and police and in other cases are believed to have 
coerced or persuaded legitimate members to turn on their coalition 
partners.

The insider killings, together with 
the persistent level of violence in Afghanistan and the number of 
foreign troops dying - 320 so far this year - are threatening to derail 
NATO's plan to hand over security to local forces.

The deputy commander of the U.S.-led NATO coalition, British Lt Gen Adrian Bradshaw, confirmed that the 
U.S. military had halted the training of some Afghan forces.

Although the move affects only about 
1,000 trainees in the Afghan Local Police, a small fraction of the 
country's 350,000-strong army and police, it highlighted the potential 
of the attacks to derail the U.S.-Afghan security handover.

He added that the decision was 'part 
of a number of actions recently instituted to reinforce existing 
precautions related to the insider threat.'

He said much of the re-vetting task 
had already been finished and that some individuals had been suspended 
pending further investigation, or removed from the force.

Bradshaw made the remarks after meeting with Karzai to discuss ways to counter the threat posed by insider attacks.

On Tuesday, Fogh Rasmussen said the 
insider shootings will not derail plans to reduce the number of international 
troops in Afghanistan, but that in the meantime, NATO will 'do everything 
it takes' to stop such killings.

Additional measures to prevent such 
attacks may include strengthened vetting and screening procedures, 
improved counterintelligence, as well as cultural awareness training, 
Fogh Rasmussen said. 

U.S.
Gen. John R. Allen, who commands NATO's 129,000-strong force, briefed 
the alliance's top decision-making body on Wednesday about the 
shootings.

In further violence today, NATO said two of its service members died in a helicopter crash in eastern Afghanistan.

It did not provide details of their nationalities, but said the crash was under investigation.

Their deaths brought to six the number of foreign troops who have been killed in Afghanistan this month.

The Taliban claimed to have shot down a helicopter in eastern Logar province, where coalition forces are staging an operation against the insurgents.

However, the militants often issue claims of responsibility even when it is unclear whether they had anything to do with the downing of an aircraft.
