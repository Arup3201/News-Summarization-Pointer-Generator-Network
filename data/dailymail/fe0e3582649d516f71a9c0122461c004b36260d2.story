Imagine, for a moment, the pressure Tyler Blackett found himself under. To one side, his new manager Louis van Gaal was watching intently. Around him, meanwhile, were seasoned trophy-winning professionals headed by Wayne Rooney, who wondered if he would deliver.

This, for the 20-year-old, was a completely new situation. But it was not on the pitch in front of 75,000 expectant fans at Old Trafford, Blackett’s first big Manchester United examination came 38,000 feet above the Atlantic Ocean.

Promise: Tyler Blackett is expected to win his first England Under-21 cap against Moldova on Tuesday

‘All the young players did one tour,’ says Blackett, taking up the story about how he was initiated into United’s squad this summer. ‘We had to get up, one by one and sing it over the speaker of the plane. I did a song by Drake [an American rapper], called Hold On, We’re Going Home.

‘It was quite fitting really, as we were on our way back [from Miami after beating Liverpool in the International Champions Cup]. Luke Shaw went first and he did a speech, answering questions from all the senior players. Darren Fletcher and Wayne were behind it. It was all in good spirits.’

If the defender passed that light-hearted examination, an altogether more serious one was presented to him on the opening day of the new Premier League campaign, when Van Gaal handed him his senior debut against Swansea.

Chance: Blackett has played in all three of Manchester United's Premier League games

Blackett responded in the 2-1 defeat with a display of some promise and he has now played in each of United’s three Premier League games.

Another first is around the corner as he is expected to win his first England Under-21 cap when Gareth Southgate’s side play their final Euro 2015 qualifier in Moldova on Tuesday.

For some, the new-found scrutiny and profile would be difficult to handle but Blackett, a lifelong United fan who has been with the club since he was seven, is studious and grounded. He epitomises the type of character that Southgate wants.

‘You have to be disciplined with it and be able to criticise yourself,’ he says during his first interview with a national newspaper. ‘It’s not an easy thing to do and can be quite difficult, especially if you are going to watch a game where you know you have not played your best. But I feel it is something you have to do if you want to improve. It is especially helpful when you are trying to learn how to play a new system [playing three at the back] like we are at United now.

‘We all watch and analyse performances together after matches. You have to study performances on your own too. I’ve not only done that at United. I did it when I was on loan at Blackpool and Birmingham [last season] as well. I get the broadcasts of my games from the media guys at the club. I take them home and watch them on my laptop.

‘Watching the games lets me know where I need to improve. I was watching one game at Carrington recently when Gary Neville walked past. He stopped, shook my hand, said “well done” and left me to it.’

Challenge: Blackett had to perform in front of United's senior players like Wayne Rooney

Neville is not the only former United great charting his progress. Rio Ferdinand, now with Queens Park Rangers, would take Blackett to one side to offer pointers, while the confidence Van Gaal has given him is clear to see.

‘I still speak with Rio now and he texts me after games,’ says Blackett. ‘He would take me for training sessions on my own where he would give me tips.

‘As for the manager, he said from day one that he was always going to help our cause and give young players a chance. It gave all the young players at the club a lift.’
