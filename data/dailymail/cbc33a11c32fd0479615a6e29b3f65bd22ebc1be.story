Kevin Mitchell came into the Last Chance Saloon, otherwise known as the O2 Arena, with all guns blazing.

By so doing he resurrected himself from the Boot Hill of boxing into a genuine world title contender, once again.

The dazzling exhibition of high-class and deeply hurtful fisticuffs with which he reduced Mexico’s Daniel Estrada to pulp inside eight rounds establishes this talented but hitherto wayward Londoner as the mandatory challenger to WBC lightweight champion Jorge Linares.

So easy a Saturday night’s work was this for the 30-year-old Mitchell that it was evident the hard work had gone into the preparation for this fight for the WBC silver belt.

Mitchell has admitted that he squandered his two previous world title challenges – against Michael Katsidis and Ricky Burns – on booze and junk food.

Given this third opportunity to reach for the stars, he cleaned up his act, thanked his new girlfriend for helping him stay on the straight and narrow and has now proved that he is living the Spartan life of a top ring professional.

Just in time, it really does seem all that talent is no to be ultimately wasted. There is talk of Linares being allowed a voluntary defence in April. But the defining day of Mitchell’s career should come this summer. 

The cavernous O2 Arena was reasonably well populated for a non-world title night and Mitchell came in to roaring London support.

Estrada was accompanied to the ring by his better known countryman Juan Manuel Marquez but the Mexican legend, in attendance more for moral and inspirational support rather than active involvement took a seat a couple of rows back from the corner.

Mitchell was much the more aggressive from the first bell and despite his opponent’s extra height and long reach he connected on a surprisingly hesitant Mexican with quick sharp lefts to head and body.

Having sworn that he is now dedicated to boxing, Mitchell was not only keener but quicker. Although Estrada did begin to find the range with his range left jab, he walked onto the crisp right hand which put him down early in the second.

Mitchell poured on the punishment in the third. Yet despite taking a whole variety of spiteful blows the ponderous Mexican somehow staggered and reeled through to the bell – and through more rounds of pure hell.

That gave Mitchell the chance to impress with lightning combinations coupled with clever innovation as he weaved into close quarters.

By the midway point at the end of the sixth round Estrada was already in need of knock-out. But Mitchell was the only man looking likely to end the evening inside the 02’s requested curfew of an 11.30 pm finish.

So slow was Estrada that he rarely landed a punch. The end looked nigh as Mitchell landed at will in the seventh but again the bell prolonged the beating. But only for another minute and 12 seconds.

Ian-John Lewis could have stopped it considerably sooner, should have called a halt as Mitchell came out bombing at the start of the eights, finally came to the gallant Estrada’s rescue as another onslaught climaxed in a left hook which left him tottering and defenceless.
