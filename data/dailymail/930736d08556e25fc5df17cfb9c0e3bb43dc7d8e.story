Wine time: Brits are most likely to crack open a bottle of wine at 6.55pm on a Wednesday to break up the week, a new study has revealed

It is the hump day that marks the end of three full days of work - but heralds another two to endure. It is no wonder that Wednesday is often cited as our least favourite day of the week - and even less surprising that it is the day most of us take to the bottle.

It has been revealed that Wednesday - in fact, Wednesday evening at 6.55pm, to be precise - is the moment when our resolve weakens and we pour ourselves a restorative glass of wine (or three).

Red wine drinkers have the edge on white, just, as it is revealed that 37 per cent will pop the cork on a bottle of red, while 36 per cent will choose white.

Meanwhile one in five (20 per cent) prefer to indulge in a glass of rose, leaving the remaining six per cent to opt for sparkling win - despite the growing popularity of prosecco.

It appears that men are the first to break the dry spell during their working week, as it is reported that on average males are having their first sip of Wednesday wine at 6.40pm, while ladies do so almost half an hour later, at 7.07pm.

Most drink their wine with a meal (52 per cent), although more than a third (37 per cent) indulge in a tipple with no accompaniment whatsoever.

The study also reveals that three quarters (76 per cent) of us prefer to drink the wine at home.

Less than one in ten (8 per cent) actually venture out of their homes and head to their local pub to enjoy a cheeky midweek drink.

Laura Phillips, an admin assistant from Basingstoke, Hants, feels Wednesday is the perfect time to have a relaxing midweek drink with her boyfriend.

The 27-year-old said: 'Wednesday is the perfect time to sit on the sofa and share a nice bottle of red.

'It breaks the working week up and I always get into my pyjamas and enjoy a few glasses at around 7pm with my dinner.

'We don't necessarily polish the bottle off but it really takes the edge off and helps me relax in the middle of a hectic working week.'

Gillian Walters, sales and marketing director at Cobevco, who carried out the study, said: 'These results give us a great insight into the nation's drinking habits.

As our working week becomes longer and stress takes its toll, people are turning to wine as a midweek treat and a bit of an escape - whether from office life or their family.

'More are forgoing an evening trip to the pub for a beverage or two in the house, as increased alcohol duty takes its effect on affordability, especially in the on trade.'
