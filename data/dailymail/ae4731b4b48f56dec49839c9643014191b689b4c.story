A callous couple stole a poppy collection tin from a supermarket by using a pair of bolt cutters to break the chain tying it to a shop till.

The man, aged about 45, and the woman, in her late 30s, waited for staff at a Tesco Express store in Bournemouth, Dorset, to turn their backs before they struck.

The woman pretended to shop at the self-checkout kiosk while her partner walked up to an empty till.

He then lifted the chain securing the British Legion Poppy Appeal tin and cut it before calmly walking outside.

Police today released this CCTV image of a woman they want to question in relation to the incident.

It is thought the collection tin had £200 in donations inside it.

The shocking theft, which took place on Monday, was caught on CCTV inside the store in the Winton area of Bournemouth, Dorset.

Aadeel Din, store manager, said: 'I think they picked this tin because it would generally hold one pound coins and it was full.

'The staff were seeing in a delivery at the time so there wasn't anyone on the tills.

'The woman pretended to go shopping, as a distraction and the man walked up to the till.

'He looked around before pulling the chain that connected the collection tin to the till and then took out a pair of pliers, cut the chain and put the tin under his coat.

'The woman then dumped the things she had picked up and they both looked around to see if anyone had noticed before they left.

'I've worked in retail for 20 years and never seen someone do this. It is cold and calculated.'

A police spokesman said officers are investigating the theft. No arrests have been made.

Inspector Dave Cuff of Norfolk Police added: 'Stealing from a charity is a heartless act, particularly in this case as we approach Remembrance Sunday.

'People donate to charities in the belief the money will be put to good use and such crimes are totally unacceptable. I would urge anyone with information about the thefts to contact police immediately.'
