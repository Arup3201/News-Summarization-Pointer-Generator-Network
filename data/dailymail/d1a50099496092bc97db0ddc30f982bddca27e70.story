Businessman has offered the bounty for 'injuring or killing' the suspect

A wealthy businessman who survived an attempt on his life by an armed assassin has turned the tables on his would-be killer - by putting a £20,000 contract on the hitman's head.

Multi-millionaire Vadim Chiorniy, from Odessa, the Ukraine, managed to fight off his attacker who was armed with a steel bar.

Now the businessman has placed an advert offering the bounty for 'injuring or killing' the suspect.

Multi-millionaire Vadim Chiorniy  - from Odessa, the Ukraine - overpowered his assassin who was armed with a steel bar. Now he has offered a contract on his attacker's head

Chiorniy - who claims the contract is 'perfectly aligned in accordance with the law' - warned the hitman in the advert: 'Look around and think about it.  How many people do you know who would sell you out for that sort of money.'

The tycoon made his fortune in the post-Communist 1990s and has survived several earlier assassination attempts.

In the advert he tells his would be killer that the crook who hired him will already be plotting to kill him to wipe him out as a witness.

'Perfectly legal': Mr Chiorniy claims the contract is 'perfectly aligned in accordance with the law'. In the advert he offers a £20,000 bounty for 'injuring or killing' the suspect

'How difficult will it be for the employer to get rid of you? Quite simple. He found you, and in the same way he will find someone else to break your head with an iron pipe.

'Surrender to the police? Nice try, you can attempt that. But your problem is that your testimony against the employer has value only when you give it to the court.

'Knowing your employer, are you sure that you will survive until it gets to court?' says the ad.

Chiorniy adds: 'I am not interested in you. You interest me no more than a pipe which was in your hands.

'Therefore,
 I offer you a deal. This is the best deal of your life, because it 
gives you a chance to stay alive. Albeit a small one, but still a 
chance.

'The deal is as follows. You call the number 0**-*****7 and very clearly and in detail tell me about the customer.

CCTV images of the attempted killing have now been seen all over the Ukraine and Russia. Here the attacker can be see armed with a metal bar

Police believe that Chiorniy may have been targeted for his business deals or because of his political links as the head of the Ukrainian Union of Anarchists

'I need all the details: when did you communicate, which telephone did you call, how did you get the money? 

'Your task is to convince me that you are telling the truth. After that you can run. I will not be looking for you.'

Police believe that Chiorniy may have been targeted for his business deals or because of his political links as the head of the Ukrainian Union of Anarchists.

One investigator said: 'You can understand his anger but we would not advise anyone to behave in this way.'
