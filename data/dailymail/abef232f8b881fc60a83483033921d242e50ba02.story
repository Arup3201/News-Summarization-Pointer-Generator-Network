Ed Miliband unveiled plans for a 
‘Robin Hood’ raid on wealthy homeowners to fund a restoration of the 10p
income tax rate yesterday.

In his most significant  economic 
policy announcement, the Labour leader said Gordon Brown’s decision to 
abolish the starting rate of tax in 2008 had been a ‘mistake’.

Mr Miliband said he wanted to  re-introduce a version of it.

Speech: Mr Miliband today said the 10p tax rate could be paid for with a mansion tax on homes worth more than £2m

Plans: Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls (left) has offered to sit down with the Lib Dems to work out how the mansion tax could be brought in

However, his proposals came under broad attack last night amid doubts over how much his proposed ‘mansion tax’ would raise.

The Institute for Fiscal Studies, the 
UK’s leading economic forecaster, said Mr Miliband’s proposal had ‘no 
plausible economic justification’, while David Cameron said it had 
clearly been ‘cobbled together overnight’.

Treasury sources said that  everyone 
who had paid the old 10p rate of tax already paid no tax at all, thanks 
to the Coalition’s decision to increase the threshold for income tax to 
£9,440.

In a speech in Bedford, Mr Miliband 
endorsed Liberal Democrat proposals – blocked by the Tories – for an 
annual levy on properties worth £2million or more.

Unexpected: The announcement on the 10p tax rate was a surprise inclusion in the address today, which had been billed as featuring no significant policy

Workers: Mr Miliband said the move would put Labour 'where it should always have been - on the side of working people'

On Wednesday, David  Cameron strongly hinted that he was thinking of  reinstating the 10p tax band so disastrously scrapped  by Gordon Brown.

So how did that cynical opportunist Ed Miliband  respond?

He stole the idea and inserted it, at the 11th hour, into yesterday’s otherwise utterly lacklustre speech on the economy.

To pay for it, he then went rummaging through the Lib Dem policy book, disinterring Nick Clegg’s unworkable plan for a ‘mansion tax’.

As we have long argued, it would be impossible to introduce such a levy without punishing widows or pensioners who live in larger homes, but have only a modest income.

What is most depressing however, is Mr Miliband’s refusal to acknowledge that, if Britain is to emerge from recession, it must encourage entrepreneurs – not clobber them with punitive taxes. 

He said it would be used to create a new 10p tax band, the size of which would be determined by how much revenue was raised.

However, aides said that Mr Miliband 
envisaged a 10p tax band  on up to the first £1,000 of income above the 
tax-free threshold – worth £100 a year to 23.5million basic rate 
taxpayers.

The threshold for the 40p band would be reduced to ensure 
that higher rate taxpayers do not benefit – sucking more families into 
that tax band.

‘We would tax houses worth over £2million,’ Mr Miliband said.

‘And we would use the money to cut taxes for working people.

‘We would put right a mistake made by Gordon Brown and the last Labour Government.’

The IFS said that to raise sufficient 
sums to pay for a 10p band covering the first £1,000 of income, an 
annual levy of £30,000 would have to be raised from every  homeowner 
with a property worth £2million or more.

There would also need to be a 
nationwide revaluation of property values, at least at the top end.  
Critics said this would mean the return of council ‘snoopers’ logging 
every detail of people’s homes that might increase their worth.

Mr Miliband’s move came a day after Mr
Cameron mocked him in the Commons, reading out an invitation to his 
speech which warned that it would contain no new policy announcements.

The Prime Minister also hinted that 
the Tories might reintroduce a 10p starting rate of tax, an idea which 
has been considered in the Treasury for some time.

Budget: Tory backbenchers want the 10p rate to be brought back in next month's Budget. Taking questions in the House Mr Cameron appeared to hint he was open to the idea

Campaigning in the Eastleigh byelection, the Prime Minister said he was not worried about Mr Miliband’s pledge.

Labour denied Tory claims that Mr 
Miliband’s tax plan had been hastily assembled, saying they had been 
working on it for months.

In 2008, Mr Miliband defended Labour’s
abolition of the 10p tax band, saying: ‘Some people do lose out... but 
overall these changes make the tax system fairer.’

Where is the brotherly love?: Ed Miliband's plans would mean that his house, left, would just miss out on having to pay the tax at a value of £1.9 million, whereas his brother David's house, right, would be taxed at £2.3 million

The IFS said that the proposal would ‘complicate the income tax system and achieve nothing that could not be better achieved in other ways’, pointing out that governments of both complexions had introduced and then abolished lower starting rates of tax.

‘To propose the same thing again suggests a remarkable failure to learn from history,’ the institute added.
