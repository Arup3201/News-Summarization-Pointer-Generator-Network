It began with the Queen planting a single tree on her Sandringham estate.

One year and 5,999,999 trees later, a project to create swathes of woodland to mark the  Diamond Jubilee reached its final milestone yesterday.

The Princess Royal planted the six millionth tree at an inner city school in a ceremony attended by David Cameron.

The scheme, run by the Woodland Trust, has seen more than 12,000 acres of woodland created across Britain.

Before planting the cherry tree at Ashburnham Community Primary School in south-west London, Princess Anne, the project’s patron, said: ‘I have to own up that I didn’t believe that was possible when we started and I am hugely impressed by that success.’

An estimated three million people were involved in the project, which created more than 400 woods of at least an acre and provided 40,000 schools and 3,500 communities with free trees.

The project has been backed by the Daily Mail and supported by our readers, who have planted many of the trees themselves.

The crowning glory is the flagship ‘Diamond Woodland’ in the National Forest in Leicestershire. Some 300 acres were set aside there to commemorate the Jubilee by the Mail as a gift to our readers.

Yesterday, Princess Anne said she hoped it was ‘very much the beginning’ of a new relationship with nature and the environment for everyone who has been involved.

She said: ‘These milestones don’t happen very often and we celebrate the event, but we also celebrate very much the person who has instilled that continuity in that period.

‘These woodlands will do that for us in the future . . . so a big thank-you on behalf of Her Majesty for a wonderful way of celebrating her Diamond Jubilee.’

Princess Anne also joked with pupils: ‘This is the six millionth tree. To those of you in this school who are going to look after it, no pressure – enjoy.’

Woodland Trust chief executive Sue Holden said: ‘The simple act of planting a tree helps children feel empowered, feel they can do something to help their local environment. And those feelings stay with them when they are adults.’

Clive Aslet, one of the trust’s leading supporters, added: ‘The campaign has proved to be  an outstanding success – thanks, not least, to the tremendous contribution of the Daily Mail and its readers.’
