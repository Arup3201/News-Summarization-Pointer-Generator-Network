The family of  Martin Luther King were left shaken after their bus almost collided with a van following a ceremony marking the 50th anniversary of the March of Washington.

Relatives of the famous civil rights activist were travelling through the American capital when the driver of their chartered bus suddenly slammed on the brakes to avoid hitting a van which had driven through a red light.

Passengers on board - which included King's sister Christine King Farris and family friend and TV personality Omarosa Manigault - were all thrown forward due to the force of the driver's braking.

As reported by the New York Daily News, the force of the sudden stop resulted in Manigault hitting her head on the seat in front of her.

Writing on Twitter afterwards, she said: 'Yikes just got banged up a lil bit on bus- I am ok! #HitMyHead ouch.'

The family members had been travelling back from a rally honoring the 50th anniversary of the 'I Have a Dream' speech in Washington.

According to TMZ, the driver of the bus needed hospital treatment following the near miss.

King's family had earlier rang a 'bell of freedom' outside the Lincoln Memorial to mark the moment he finished his famous speech.

Sore: King family friend and TV personality Omarosa Manigault tweeted about the near miss

Despite being surrounded by presidents, 
senators, a first lady and even Oprah Winfrey, Martin Luther King Jr.’s 
adorable granddaughter Yolanda
 Renee King was the star of the show.

The five-year-old kept her cool as Barack Obama hugged her mother and 
father and even gave her a tickle as she stood regally at the forefront of 
the event honoring her grandfather’s march on Washington.

The King family rang a bell at the steps of the 
Lincoln Memorial that once hung in the 16th Street Baptist Church in 
Birmingham, Alabama, which was the target of a racially motivated 
bombing that killed four little girls in 1963.

So cute! Not even a president could take the spotlight off of Martin Luther King Jr.'s adorable granddaughter, 5-year-old Yolanda Renee King at the 50th anniversary of the March of Washington

In
 front of tens of thousands of spectators, President Obama urged 
America to continue fighting for the equal nation Martin Luther King Jr.
 envisioned as he delivered a rousing speech marking 50 years since the 
activist's iconic 'I Have a Dream' address.

Speaking
 from beneath the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C., the president 
celebrated how far America has come since Dr King's speech on August 28,
 1963, which gave a 'mighty voice to the quiet hopes of millions'.

But 
he said there was still much to be done to honor the lives that were 
lost during the civil rights movement.

Impassioned: Thousands of people gather for a march 'For Jobs and Justice' down Pennsylvania Avenue toward the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC on Wednesday morning

'They did not die in vain,' he said 
to the crowds gathered below. 'Their victory was great. But we would 
dishonor those heroes as well to suggest that the work of this nation is
 somehow complete.

'The arc of the moral universe may bend towards 
justice, but it doesn't bend on its own.

'To secure the gains this 
country has made requires constant vigilance, not complacency.'

He
 added that economic inequality - in which black unemployment is nearly 
twice that of white unemployment - and a country where many citizens 
still struggle to afford healthcare 'remains our great unfinished 
business'.

There were 
also impassioned addresses from former Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy
 Carter, who commented on America's unfinished business, with Clinton 
saying: 'A great democracy does not make it harder to vote than buy an 
assault weapon.'
