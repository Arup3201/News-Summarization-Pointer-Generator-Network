Don't mind sitting in the sunshine firing off a few tweets to friends?

Well then, don't let the grass grow under your feet, apply to become the World's first Mower Monitor!

A Spanish company has put out an advert to find a 'grass guard' with responsibility for keeping a very relaxed eye on an automatic lawn mower as it chops its way through a park in Madrid.

The staggering job offer by Spanish gardening company Husqvarna comes with a salary of 2,000 euros (£1,636) for a month's work.

Advert: It reads: 'We are searching for young people aged between 25 and 35, and capable of watching the grass grow while the Husqvarna Automower does the work for you'

According to the advert the candidate who becomes the first Husqvana Automatic Lawnmower Supervisor will 'be able to read, tweet, surf the internet, check emails and sunbathe' as the lawn mower cuts the grass.

Hi-tech Husqvarna, which makes machines for forests, gardens and
parks, if offering the position in an attempt to promote the robot lawnmower which costs up to £3,600.

The company claims the automatic grass cutter requires no human
intervention and the new employee will effectively just have to watch the grass
grow in a park in Madrid during month of May.

Futuristic: Husqvana's £2,600 Automower Solar Hybrid is the world's first fully automatic lawn mower that is partly powered by the sun. The top of the range £3,600 sends a text to your mobile phone should its mowing be disturbed

Anyone between the ages of 25 and 35 years old who is one of Spain's millions of long-term unemployed and crucially is familiar with social
networking is invited to apply.

The latter is essential as the chosen applicant will be
expected to relate his or her experiences on Facebook and Twitter.

As may be expected with Spain’s unemployment figure above
the five million mark and around 50 per cent of young people out of work,
applications have been flooding in.

The company has also been using its Facebook page to ask
fans to suggest which Madrid park it should use to show off its latest product.

Madrid's botanical gardens and Parque Juan Carlos I have both been put forward as suggestions

More than 400 people have already applied to be the ‘grass
guard,' in what Husqvarna is calling ‘the best gig this spring.’
