A schoolboy needed 37 pints of blood after crashing his brand new scooter into a telegraph pole.

Doctors gave Matthew Hansford, 16, just a two per cent chance of survival and put him on a life support machine.

He suffered a collapsed lung, heart damage, torn kidneys and fractured ribs.

The accident happened the day day he bought the 50cc scooter, just over a week after his 16th birthday.

Matthew, from Brinscall, Lancashire, said he swerved to avoid a fox. No other vehicles were involved in the accident on Blackburn Brow, Chorley, Lancashire, on November 1.

After several operations and more than three weeks in a critical condition, Matthew began to improve and is now at home making a slow recovery.

He said: 'It’s difficult but I’m getting better little by little. I can’t walk unaided for any distance and I still have blood clot issues in my heart area.

'The main thing is I’m still here and I’m determined to get better.'

Matthew, who goes to school in Preston had completed a computer-based learning course on riding motorcycles prior to venturing onto the road.

He also made sure he was wearing the correct protective clothing.

'Wearing a proper bike jacket and helmet definitely saved my life,” he said.

'I wouldn’t put anyone of getting a bike but I would say get the safest clothing and equipment and never mess around or take risks.'

Matthew’s mother Alison, who represents Wheelton and Withnell as a borough councillor, is now helping her son recover, along with dad Steve and sister, Victoria, 17.

Mrs Hansford said: 'At one stage we thought Matthew’s chances were very slim. But typically for him, he thought of others and before one of the operations he told me about his donor card and his wishes should the worst happen.

'The surgeon said his young age helped him survive and we’re just all so relieved that he’s improving.'

Incredibly Matthew, has said he wants to return to motorcycles and join the British Legion Riders, a group who attend military funerals and repatriations.

'It’s something very important to me,' he said.
