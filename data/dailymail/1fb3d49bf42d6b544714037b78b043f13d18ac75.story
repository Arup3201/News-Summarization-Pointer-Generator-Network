Fraser Forster is determined to put as much pressure as possible on Joe Hart ahead of the next England squad announcement.

The Southampton goalkeeper’s displays this season, since moving from Celtic for £10million in the summer, have made him a real contender to become England’s No 1.

On Wednesday night against Arsenal he pulled off a series of outstanding saves to keep Southampton level in the game before Alexis Sanchez scored a late winner. Now he has set his sights on becoming Roy Hodgson’s first-choice ‘keeper.

‘It’s obviously something I’ve dreamt of as a kid to be England’s No 1,’ Forster said. ‘Joe Hart is a top goalkeeper himself and playing at Manchester City.

‘It’s important I work as hard as I can and put as much pressure on him. Me and Ben Foster will both be doing that. Working as hard as we can and putting as much pressure on Joe as possible.’

There is much of the season to play before the national team meet up again in March. Playing for Southampton, who remain third in the table despite that defeat, has helped put Forster in the spotlight this season.

Heading towards the half-way stage they are going toe-to-toe with City and are just one point behind them.

Forster added: ‘For me it’s important I play as well as I can for Southampton. It’s a long time until I’ve got another international game so it’s about concentrating on club football.

‘Long-term I’ve just got to work as hard as I can and see what happens.’
