A failed asylum seeker who came to Britain unable to speak English has secured a place at Oxford - but now worries that his whole family could be deported to Afghanistan.

Muhammad Abdul Ghani achieved outstanding grades in his A-levels after just two years of living in the country.

However, since his family's asylum request was rejected, he faces the prospect of being kicked out of Britain.

Success: Muhammad Abdul Ghani has secured a place at Oxford two years after moving to Britain from Syria

Muhammad, 18, is of Afghan descent but was born in Iran and grew up in Syria - which is now being torn apart in a brutal civil war.

In February 2011, he came to Britain with his mother Zohra, 17-year-old brother Ammar and sister Fatema, seven.

The family settled in Oldham, and Muhammad started studying for his A-levels at Oldham Sixth Form College.

Despite the language barrier, he was quickly able to excel, especially in the sciences.

Last week he received his A-level results, learning that he had achieved an A* in maths and A in chemistry and physics.

'If this was two years ago I would have said getting these results was impossible,' he said. 'It's been really surprising.

'I didn't speak a word of English and it was really hard work, especially in the first year. I found it difficult to understand the teachers, so I used to bring a tape recorder to all my lessons to play it back afterwards.

'My grades could've been much better if I had better English but I'm really pleased with them.'

He was awarded a place to study physics at Wadham College, Oxford, whose alumni include Christopher Wren, Michael Foot and Rowan Williams.

The family had applied to stay in Britain, claiming that they would be in danger if forced to return to Afghanistan or Syria.

But the asylum claim was turned down, meaning they will be deported if they do not leave voluntarily.

'There's a fear that they will send us back and it's just not fair,' Muhammad said. 'This is my home now.

'If we go back our lives are at risk. I still have friends in Afghanistan and Syria but they fight to stay alive every day.'

The family is currently planning to lodge an appeal against the Home Office decision.

If they are forced to leave Britain, Muhammad will be able to apply for a student visa in order to take up his studies at Oxford.

A spokesman for the Home Office declined to comment, saying the body does not discuss individual cases.

His plight is similar to that of Najibullah Hashimi, who was deported to Afghanistan earlier this year despite building a new life in Britain.

The 18-year-old had achieved 13 GCSEs and was considered a pillar of his community, captaining the school cricket team and mentoring other Afghan youths.

But he was forced to return to Afghanistan, which he had fled aged 11 after his father was murdered by the Taliban.
