A drug-crazed thief was Tasered after he threatened to hack off a police dog's head with garden shears, in an incident captured on CCTV.

Jamie Swann, 28, was filmed jumping the fence of terrified neighbour Jane Green, 59, and then attacking her car with the bladed tool in the middle of the night.

The maniac then wildly waved the 2ft long garden implement around his head and violently smashing up the Ford B-Max, before police shot him.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Danger: This is the terrifying moment a drug-crazed criminal threatened to hack off a police dog's head with some shears as he stands on his neighbour's car

Punishment: An armed officer Tasers the maniac, which sends his garden shears flying through the air (centre) as electricity is pumped through him  

Rush: Police then flooded into the property and detain him after an incident that has put him in jail

Brave: Grandmother Jane Green runs from the cover of her house to open her gate for police while the criminal climbs a fence behind her

The disabled grandmother-of-four can then be seen leaving her Nottinghamshire home in her dressing gown to allow police onto her property.

She then ran back into her house in Clifton and locked herself in to watch the tense 10 minute stand-off with officers that followed on her CCTV monitor.

Swann, wearing a white t-shirt and blue trousers, is seen ranting at police - even putting the shears around his own neck and threatening to chop his head off.

At one point the raging thug viciously snaps the weapon at a police dog as he stands on top of Jane's car screaming at officers.

He can be seen finally being stopped in his tracks after being tasered with the 5,000 volt stun gun, which sends him crashing down on the roof of the vehicle. 

Sequence; Mrs Green can be seen on her own CCTV camera opening her gate for officers because she spotted Swann stealing copper from her home

Damage: He then climbs on to her car and begins attacking it as the authorities arrive at the scene

Danger: Waving the shears, and even holding it round his own throat, her screams at police and ambulance workers

Eight officers then swarm the garden to arrest Swann as he convulses on the ground as a result of the electric shock.

On Tuesday Swann was jailed at Nottingham Crown Court after pleading guilty to criminal damage and using threatening words to cause alarm or distress.

He was imprisoned for 22-months, four-months for the incident and a further 18-months for breaching a suspended sentence for theft, burglary and theft of a motor vehicle

Today Mrs Green described the terrifying moment she spotted Swann on her CCTV monitors after hearing him climbing on her roof at 2am on October 14.

'I came downstairs to switch on the security lights and called 999. He was stealing my copper piping,' the retired medical secretary said:

'My front gate was locked and I didn't want to be locked in with him so I ran past him to unlock it for the police.

'I don't know how I did it - it must have been adrenaline - I thought 'you're not going to get away with this'.

'I then ran back inside and locked the door and watched him on my CCTV monitor.

Under control: Having refused to leave the car or drop his weapon a Nottinghamshire police officer then takes aim with his Taser

Hurt: The flash of electricity can be seen from the Taser as the thug falls down after being shot

'He was definitely on drugs and when the police came in he tried to hack their dog with the shears - he was threatening to behead the dog.

Living in fear: Jane Green says the 'The whole ordeal has left me a nervous wreck and badly out of pocket'

'Once he was tasered, the dog dragged him off to the side.

'I thought he was trying to break into my house.

'I was terrified - afterwards I did not sleep for weeks and I still struggle now.

'I feel like moving house - it has petrified me and I am a prisoner in my home because I don't dare go out.

'The man was totally unknown to me and he was shouting about guns and waiving around my garden shears which he picked up.

'The whole thing was a nightmare and I can't remember ever being so frightened in my life.'

Swann caused £920 damage to Jane's mobility car and car-port but no penalty charge was imposed by the court.

The mother-of-two, who suffers from fibromyalgia - a disorder of the nervous system that leaves sufferers in chronic pain - added: 'I have paid for a new roof, windscreen, bonnet and car port.

'He also ripped all the copper piping off the side of my house, which I have also had to replace.

'I have not got any compensation because he was not ordered to pay any - its disgusting.

'The whole ordeal has left me a nervous wreck and badly out of pocket.'

Crime scene: Mrs Green where she and police confronted a maniac armed with a pair of shears in her front garden

A Nottinghamshire Police spokesman said: 'While we appreciate how unnerving this incident was for the person at this address, thankfully random attacks on property are rare.

'This offender is now in prison so we hope that this sends a message that intimidating behaviour and causing damage to someone's property will not be tolerated.'
