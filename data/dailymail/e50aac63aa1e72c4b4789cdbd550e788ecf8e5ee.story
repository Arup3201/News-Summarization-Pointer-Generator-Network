TV presenter Keith Chegwin has been caught in a war of words with a BBC radio reporter who claimed his voice made her feel ‘physically sick’.

The 52-year-old took offence when BBC Wiltshire radio reporter Marie Lennon slammed his forthcoming pantomime appearance in a post on her Twitter page saying ‘Keith Chegwin’s voice makes me feel physically sick’.

The Scouse star - known as Cheggers - responded on the social networking site, criticising the ‘rude’ tweet saying: ‘How BBC radio has changed. Sad’.

The reporter who presents BBC Introducing in Wiltshire hastily deleted her offensive remark and apologised to the presenter - who used to front TV favourite Swap Shop for the corporation.

She has since deleted her Twitter account.

A spokesman for the BBC said yesterday: 'This was her personal view for which she has now apologised. It doesn’t reflect the views of the station.

Twitter tactics: BBC radio reporter Marie Lennon was quick to delete her tweet about Keith Chegwin's voice making her 'sick' but not before the TV legend saw it and responded

‘BBC Wiltshire is looking forward to Keith Chegwin appearing in pantomime at the Wyvern Theatre this Christmas.’

The row broke after it emerged Keith Chegwin, who played Buttons in Cinderella at Wyvern Theatre, in Swindon, Wiltshire, last year, was due back to star in Aladdin this year.

On hearing this news Ms Lennon tweeted about the TV legend: ‘Keith Chegwin’s voice makes me feel physically sick’ last week.

Fellow BBC radio presenter at the Swindon-based station, Anna Bird, joined in and said: ‘I agree! I felt sick at work today and now I know why’.

Ms Lennon deleted the post but not before it was seen by Cheggers who was quick to respond on the micro-blogging site.

He tweeted: '@BBCWiltshire Top presenter @marie-lennon using BBC’s name, is slagging me off. How BBC Radio has changed. Sad.

‘@marie-lennon the @BBCWiltshire presenter has deleted rude Tweet about me. Still using BBC’s name 2 (sic) get followers.’

Marie later tweeted: ‘Sorry if anyone was offended by yesterday’s tweet. Very long day.’

Staff at the Wyvern Theatre said Cheggers was a huge hit when he played Buttons in Cinderella at the theatre last year.

Back in the day it was BBC: Keith Chegwin (right) tweeted how sad it was that 'BBC radio has changed' since he co-presented BBC show Swap Shop with John Craven, Noel Edmonds and Maggie Philbin

Richard Loftus, marketing manager for the theatre said: ‘At the Wyvern we’re all huge fans of Keith Chegwin’s voice.

‘And that’s why he is returning to our theatre for another year of pantomime this Christmas.’

Keith Chegwin became a household name in the 1970s with children’s quiz ‘Cheggers Plays Pop’.

He will juggle a role as Wishee Washee in Aladdin at the Wyvern Theatre this Christmas with a spot on Dancing on Ice.

Cheggers was due to compete in this year’s series of the popular ITV1 show but broke several ribs during a practice run.

Aladdin will run at the Wyvern Theatre from December 8 to January 6.
