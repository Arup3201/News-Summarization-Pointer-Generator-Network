A recent Canadian news article showcasing a New York City artist who makes millions from her invisible works of art has been revealed to be a joke.

Though intended as a satire, the September piece on CBC.com about 27-year-old Lana Newstrom, who told the site her 'art is about imagination,' managed to infuriate art world critics who didn't get the joke.

Now the writers and readers who cried 'the emperor has no clothes' are the ones left with their pants down.

Who's laughing now? Two prankster Canadian radio hosts duped a bunch of media types with a hoax story about a New York artist whose 'invisible' works of art fetch millions of dollars

Guardian art blogger Jonathan Jones wrote on Tuesday that the outrage that grew out of the misunderstood joke because so many are 'shocked and repelled by the art market' and of 'the image of rich people forking out for invisible art.'

The CBC article, which was penned by radio pranksters Pat Kelly and Peter Oldring, quoted Newstrom's imaginary art dealer as saying 'her invisible works can fetch upwards of a million dollars.'

Jones points out just a couple of the gullible outlets who had knee-jerk reactions to the piece, including sports website Barstool.

'If you’re some artsy fartsy idiot paying money for invisible art, you GOTTA kill yourself,' they wrote.

The CBC report was shared and liked tens of thousands of times and the comments sections lit up after outlets reported the hoax as fact, with many readers ridiculing the fictional young woman and her nonexistent art.

Another piece published at CBC revealed the pranksters intentions with the joke.

'In the arts, there is much room for interpretation and we thought it would be interesting to push the idea to the extreme–invisible art,' said Pat Kelly. 

While the audio piece posted along with the CBC article seems to make all but clear that there isn't actually a Lana Newstrom, someone did to the trouble of creating a website and social media accounts for her.

'Just because you can’t see anything, doesn’t mean I didn’t put hours of work into creating a particular piece,' Newstrom writes on the site, where titles like 'Transparent Baloon' and 'Tough Day' are posted below empty spaces.

Obviously a joke: The fictional artist, 27-year-old Lana Newstrom, even has a website of her 'works' where titles like 'Strawberry' and 'Tough Day' accompany nothing but empty space
