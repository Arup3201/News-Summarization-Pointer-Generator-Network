A film producer knocked out cold by two thugs in the street brought his attackers to justice after tracking them down on Facebook.

Jonathan Rawstrone was set upon shortly after meeting the pair on a night out in Preston, Lancashire.

After coming round, he spent the next 48 hours trawling social networking sites and piecing together titbits of information gleaned from his conversations with the men in a bid to track them down.

He eventually found the online profiles of Matthew Lakeland, a serving soldier, and Ben Craig, and passed their details onto detectives, who said the information was crucial to the conviction.

Lakeland, 21, who is based in Catterick, North Yorkshire, and Craig, 19, of Lower Bank Road in Fulwood, Preston, have both now pleaded guilty to actual bodily harm at Preston Crown Court, according to The Lancashire Evening Post.

As the pair await sentencing on February 20, Mr Rawstrone today relived the attack, which took place last May shortly after he had moved to the city from his home town of Kirkham.

The 35-year-old, who is currently working on two feature films for Preston-based Mycho Pictures, told the Lancashire Evening Post: 'I got chatting to my attackers outside the Mill nightclub on Aqueduct Street.

'Lakeland told me he was a soldier and seemed very pleasant.

'I actually thanked him for serving our country.

'We started walking along Fylde Road (to another nightclub) when the Lakeland’s friend started swinging for me.

'I turned around and then I got knocked out.'

Mr Rawstrone, also known as Jonny Raw, said he woke to find his face 'all mushed up' and claimed that his phone and designer jacket were missing.

He added: 'I was determined they shouldn’t get away with it or be able to do it to anyone else. I have a strong friend network in Preston and with their help I started to do some research on Facebook.

'I had a breakthrough when some friend who knew the pair had had texts off them apparently bragging about the attack.'

DC Ian Best, of Preston CID, said: 'He did an excellent job and as a result it has helped us catch the offenders.'
