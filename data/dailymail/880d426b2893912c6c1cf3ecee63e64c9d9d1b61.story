Despite a glittering career at the top as a player Burton Albion 'novice' Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink is under no illusions he has to earn his right as a manager.

The former Chelsea, Leeds and Middlesbrough striker took his first management role in England when he was appointed by the League Two side in November.

And Hasselbaink, who scored 127 Premier League goals during his distinguished career, says his achievements as a player count for nothing as he starts at the bottom of the managerial ladder.

Hasselbaink scored 70 Premier League goals for Chelsea during a four-year spell from 2000-2004

'I don't talk about it. Never,' Hasselbaink told the Guardian's Stuart James. 'The other day we were driving to the game at Wycombe and there were goals of mine on Sky on the team coach. I was embarrassed. I know it's me, but... it's gone. We don't have to talk about when I was a player. I have to earn my right as a manager.'

'What does that mean: "Too big for that"? If I was Jose Mourinho and I would come to Burton, then you can say something. I know my role. I know who I am, I know what I have done as a manager, I consider myself novice.'

Hasselbaink played under Steve McLaren at Middlesbrough before coaching under him at Nottingham Forest, and the 42-year-old reserves the highest praise for the former England manager.

But the Burton manager believes his achievements as a player count for nothing as a manager

'Best English coach there is. Fact. Because he can coach. He can make players better. He went with the modern game. He is not still there, where he was 10 years ago when he was at Middlesbrough, where he was so successful. He has evolved.'

Hasselbaink was capped 23 times for Holland  and played under Louis van Gaal with the national side, and the Burton boss reveals that beneath the prickly exterior the Manchester United manager has a soft centre.

'Very intimidating but very fair and very loving. If you keep on doing things wrong, he will pinpoint you. If you do it good, he will also tell you that you did it good. He's also got a soft side to him that you don't see. If you go and speak to him, he's very open. He's a good man.'
