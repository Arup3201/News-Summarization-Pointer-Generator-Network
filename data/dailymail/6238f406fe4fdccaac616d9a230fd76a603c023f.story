His thunderous thighs shocked the world during the London 2012 Olympics - and they’re back again.

German cyclist Robert Förstemann left ITV presenter Sian Welby speechless in Manchester when she used a tape measure to find the circumference of one of his thighs was a whopping 28 inches.

They met at the National Cycling Centre last night for round three of the Revolution Series cycling event - and Ms Welby found one of his thighs was bigger than her waist by an inch.

Amazed: The hilarious photos were taken at the National Cycling Centre for round three of the Revolution Series cycling event - and Ms Welby found one of his thighs was bigger than her waist by an inch

Ms Welby, of Nottinghamshire, a former New Look sales assistant who is also now a Channel 5 weather presenter, said on Twitter yesterday: 'His one thigh was bigger than my waist by an inch!’

Förstemann himself posted the picture on his Facebook page today, captioned: ‘Pic of the day...’

The cyclist’s thighs exploded into the public consciousness last July at the Olympics after he was pitted against his compatriot Andre Greipel in a 'quad off' by New Zealand cyclist Greg Henderson.

The track and road racing cyclist posted a photograph on Twitter of the pair standing next to each other bearing their muscular bottom halves, and it was retweeted more than 1,750 times.

Mr Henderson said on Twitter on July 27: 
‘You thought Greipel has a big set of legs. There was a quad off in the 
German camp today. Greipel lost.’

Laughter: The two clearly found the measuring ceremony very funny, ahead of Wednesday's highlights show

The picture seemed to prove the two cyclists - donning only boxers, with trousers dropped to their ankles - had been sticking to their strict Games training regime, no doubt with plenty of squats.

Although Greipel’s thighs looked big in the photo that went viral around the world, Förstemann, 26, had freakishly large vein-laden muscles which dwarfed those of his 30-year-old compatriot.

Later on at the Olympics, sports fans who marvelled at Forstemann were also impressed by Italian swimmer Fabio Scozzoli and his 'waterwings' and an impressive torso which drew gasps from fans.

When the 24-year-old dived in the water for the men's 100m breaststroke final, his fully flexed underarm muscles looked like a pair of wings.
