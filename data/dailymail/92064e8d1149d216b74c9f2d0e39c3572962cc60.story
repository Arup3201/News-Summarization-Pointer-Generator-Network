The 11-year-old boy walked free from court today after pleading guilty to eight crimes 

A one boy crime wave blamed for a fifth of all crime in is home town has walked free from court at the age of 11 after telling magistrates he wants to be a bank manager.

The child, accused of exposing himself in a Carphone Warehouse and abusing customers with foul language in Costa Coffee, appeared before Yeovil Magistrates in Somerset today. 

After being told to pay attention and take his hands out of his pockets, the schoolboy said he wanted to work in a bank as he was good at maths.

Having arrived with his grandfather, the court was adjourned for two hours while police officers looked for his mother.

Upon his return he entered the court grinning to hear accusations of exposing himself to a girl in public and using profane language towards mothers and children in a coffee shop in Shepton Mallet. 

On his own, he caused a soar in the number of crimes reported in the sleepy rural village, said police.  

Describing the latest offences, Judith Morris, prosecuting, said: 'The offences took place on the 11 November last year at around 3.30 pm at the Townsend retail park in Shepton Mallet.

'[He] was there, he walked into Costa Coffee and shouted various swear words when inside.

'In the store was mostly mums with children or elderly people. They were alarmed and distressed.

'After running out, a few minutes later he was outside a Carphone Warehouse. An 11-year-old girl was there.

'He called to get her attention and then he pulled down his trousers and pants exposing his genitals. She went home and told her mother.' 

But the court heard how the child, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had 'impressed' his solicitor as a 'nice, well behaved boy'. 

The trouble, his grandfather said, stemmed from the fact he had recently contacted his father to whom he had not spoken in the past. 

After pleading guilty to eight charges including threatening behaviour, violence against a person, and arson, the 11-year-old was told he could put his crimes 'behind him'. 

The child was accompanied in court by his grandfather, but proceedings were halted for two hours while officers searched for his mother

Sentencing, Chair David Phillips said: 'I’m sure now it has all taken place you can appreciate how frightened people were. You realise that is wrong.

'We have heard consistently you are an intelligent boy. In terms of age, you are. You will now be given and opportunity to put this behind you.'

Later, his mother said his bad behaviour was down to a lack of support at school. 

'For me as a mother this stress is awful. There’s no anger management, no counselling. It has been awful.

'There’s limited school support. That’s why it’s taken so long - lack of funding.'
