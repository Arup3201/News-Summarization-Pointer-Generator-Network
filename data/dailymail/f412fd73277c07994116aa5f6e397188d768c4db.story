If Novak Djokovic had his doubters after losing three straight Grand Slam finals then so did the man who coached him to the Wimbledon title on Sunday - Boris Becker.

So for the 46-year-old German there was a particular pleasure in proving wrong those who believed his appointment was a gimmick, or merely an attempt to copy Andy Murray in his choice of Ivan Lendl.

Becker came out on top of Sunday’s coaching face-off with his old rival Stefan Edberg, but he believes that today’s stars hiring those of yesteryear was always going to make sense.

Been there, done it: Boris Becker believes today's stars like Novak Djokovic should learn from the greats

‘Stefan in my opinion knows a lot more about tennis than 99 per cent of the people involved in tennis and I’m not far behind,’ said Becker as he celebrated at the Champions’ Dinner at the Royal Opera House. ‘I think it was time for the top players to understand that if they want to improve. There is an understanding Stefan and I have about the sport, that it’s not about the first or second point, it’s about those moments when it’s about winning and losing.

‘I am including Ivan in that list too. It’s obvious what Ivan brought to Murray and I’m surprised that people were surprised.’ 

Becker said that his arrangement with Djokovic, the now restored world No 1, could develop into a long one.

‘As long as we have fun with it,’ he added. ‘As long as he thinks I bring something to the table, as long as I feel I can bring something he hasn’t heard. If it’s successful, if my wife allows me to be travelling like that and behave like a 25-year-old, then sure it could. Novak and I have an unbelievable amount of respect for one another. But friends? I would rather not go with him on a bachelor weekend in Ibiza, put it that way.

‘I remember how I felt (winning Slams) and this hasn’t happened for a long time that I remembered how I felt on the court. I noticed emotions that I haven’t felt in a long time and that’s a driving force.’
