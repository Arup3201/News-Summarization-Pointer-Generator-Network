A new reality series spin-off is documenting the lives of two couples, one year after they agreed to take part in an 'extreme social experiment' which saw them walk down the aisle together, having never met before. 

Married at First Sight: The First Year follows the day-to-day lives of married couples Doug, 31, and Jamie, 28, and Jason, 28, and Cortney, 27, two of the three couples who starred in the original FYI series, which saw the newlyweds paired up with their 'perfect match' by a group of relationship experts.

The new series, which is due to premiere tonight, details the everyday ups and downs of married life from the couples' six month anniversary up until their one year milestone marker, as they strive to adjust to life as newlyweds.

The happy couples: Doug, 31, and Jamie, 28 (L), and Jason, 28, and Cortney, 27 (R), agreed to take part in a social experiment which saw them each wed a complete stranger

Going strong: While one of the couples featured in the original series decided to divorce, the other two are still enjoying married life, with both revealing their their relationships have grown increasingly happy 

Despite her initial doubts about her wedding, nurse Jamie Otis, who initially described her marriage as 'the worst decision of her life', and her husband Doug Hehner reveal that their relationship blossomed during the first few months - and the only thing coming between them these days is their difference in opinion about when they should have children.

'It's definitely generated some talk,' Doug revealed to the New York Post. 

'I just think that we're not where we need to be as a couple to introduce a child. It takes focus off of the relationship and there's still room to grow for Jamie and I. 

'I think it's too soon to even introduce that. But it's something definitely in the near future for us.'

In the preview for tonight's Married at First Sight episode, the couple can be seen debating the pros and cons of starting a family of their own, with Jamie growing increasingly broody as she spends time with some of Doug's younger family members.

'I am ready to have babies, and to do it with someone who is as excited as I am,' Jamie says.

For EMT Jason Carrion and his wife Cortney Hendrix, who both admit to falling head over heels for one another almost instantly, married life has proved slightly more tricky.

Shortly after their wedding, the couple went through a period of emotional upheaval, when Jason's mother unexpectedly passed away. 

And after struggling to cope with such a devastating loss, the couple were then forced apart by Jason's five-month-long fire academy training, which left them feeling as though they were living 'completely separate lives'.

I now pronounce you... Despite her initial reservations about the wedding, nurse Jamie Otis (R) admits she is now incredibly happy in her marriage to Doug (L)

Ups and downs: While Jason and Cortney fell in love almost instantly, they have already had to weather their fair share of complications

'It was really difficult trying to juggle being newly married and still trying to get to know each other and having such a huge thing like the fire academy coming in,' Jason explained to the Post. 

'I didn't realize it was going to be this hard. That was one of my major concerns from the beginning, will things be different [after the experiment]? They were, things for a while were different.' 

And, it seems as though things may have gone from bad to worse for the young couple, with Cortney revealing in the preview for this evening's episode that she has been 'let go' from her job.

'I'm being nicely let go from my job,' she reveals. 

'I haven't told Jason about the whole work thing yet. With Jason being in the Academy, the last thing we need is me losing my job and it is going to hurt our relationship.' 

But the couple insist that they remain happy in their marriage - and are confident that their one year anniversary will be the first of many more to come. 

'[Married life] is good, it's good, I can't complain,' Jason tells a group of his colleagues in tonight's episode. 'It's working out good, I really am [in love with my wife].'
