Whistleblowing website WikiLeaks today started to publish more than five million confidential emails from the global intelligence company Stratfor.

The emails, dated from July 2004 to late December 2011, are said to reveal the 'inner workings' of US-based firm known as the 'Shadow CIA'.

Among the allegations to emerge is that Stratfor's claim to be a media organisation providing a subscription intelligence newsletter is a front for 'running paid informants networks' and 'laundering those payments through the Bahamas, through Switzerland, through private credit cards'.

Stratfor 'is monitoring Bhopal activists for Dow Chemicals, Peta activities for Coca-Cola', WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange claimed at a press conference in London today.

However, what could cause the greatest embarrassment for the U.S. government is his suggestion that information is also being gathered by paying contacts from agencies including the U.S. 
Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Marines and the U.S. Defense 
Intelligence Agency.

Mass leak: WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange speaks at a news conference in London today as his organisation began publishing over five million confidential emails from U.S. intelligence company Stratfor

U.S.-based security think-tank Stratfor is known in some circles as the 'shadow CIA'.

The
Austin, Texas-based organisation provides political, economic and 
military analysis to help clients reduce risk, according to a 
description on its YouTube page.

Founded by George Friedman, it further describes itself as a subscription-based publisher of geopolitical 
analysis with an intelligence-based approach to gathering information.

In December, the Anonymous movement vowed to heap further embarrassment on Stratfor.

It wants to humiliate the firm by publishing the communications.

And it said they could provide the 'smoking gun for a number of crimes' - although exactly which crimes were not specified.

Adding
insult to inury, the hackers said Stratfor, which charges up to 300,000 subscribers 
for its reports and analysis, was 'clueless' when it came to database 
security.

Assange said: 'Here we have a private intelligence firm, relying on informants from the U.S. government, foreign intelligence agencies with questionable reputations and journalists.'

Emails between George Friedman, the founder of Stratfor, and Karl Rover, a senior adviser to George Bush, are among those that are being released.

At today's press conference, Mr Assange said he would not reveal where the emails had come from.

'We are a source protection organisation,' he said. 'As a source protection organisation and simply as a media organisation we don't discuss or speculate on sourcing.'

The documents are believed to have come from loose-knit hacker group Anonymous, which claimed to have stolen information from the firm in December.

Wikileaks said the emails show 
Stratfor's 'web of informers, pay-off structure, payment-laundering 
techniques and psychological methods'.

It also said the material contains privileged information about the U.S. government's attacks against Julian Assange and WikiLeaks and Stratfor's own attempts to subvert WikiLeaks.

The group said there are more than 4,000 emails mentioning WikiLeaks or Julian Assange.

But
today Mr Assange said more information would emerge in the near future:
'We have looked most closely at the actions against us, the bigger 
story is likely to come out of this probably in three or four days' 
time.'

Assange told how Stratfor 'fronts as an intelligence publisher', but provides confidential intelligence services to large corporations

He added: 'Today Wikileaks started releasing over five million emails from private intelligence firm Stratfor based in Texas.

'Together
with 25 other media partners from around the world we have been 
investigating the activities of this company for some months.

'And what we have discovered is a company that is a private intelligence Enron.

'On the surface it presents as if it's a media organisation providing a private subscription intelligence newsletter.

'But
underneath it is running paid informants networks, laundering those 
payments through the Bahamas, and through Switzerland, through private 
credit cards.

'It is monitoring Bhopal activists for Dow Chemicals, Peta activities for Coca-Cola.

'It is engaged in a seedy business.'

Julian Assange burst into the public consciousness in April 2010 when WikiLeaks released Collateral Murder - video footage of a U.S. air crew shooting Iraqi civilians in 2007.

The whistleblower website, which claimed a database of 1.2 million documents within a year of its 2006 launch, regularly hit the headlines in 2010 with a series of leaks.

The U.S. Embassy cables, Afghanistan war logs and Iraq war logs, which were drip-fed to the media in 2010, helped raise his profile.

The Australian-born 40-year-old is currently under house arrest in Britain and fighting extradition to Sweden for questioning over alleged sex crimes.

He is accused of sexual misconduct by two ex-WikiLeaks volunteers.

Mr
Assange said Stratfor was using the secret intelligence it had paid for
to invest in a wide range of 'geopolitical financial instruments'.

'This makes News of the World look like kindergarten,' he added.

Mr
Assange said the exposure of the emails was part of a long history 
WikiLeaks has had in exposing the activities of secret organisations.

He
said: 'The activities of intelligence organisations increasingly are 
privatised and once privatised they are taken out of the realm of the 
Freedom of Information Act, of U.S. military law and so they are often 
used by governments who want to conceal particular activity.

'But Stratfor is simply out of control.

'Even
as a private intelligence organisation it is being completely hopeless 
in protecting the identity of its informants, or even providing accurate
information. It is engaged in internal deals with a financial 
investment firm that it is setting up.

'It really is some type of Enron where there is not even proper corporate control within the organisation.'

WikiLeaks said it had worked with 25 media organisations to investigate and information would be released over the coming weeks.

The
group said the emails expose a 'revolving door' in private intelligence
companies in the U.S., claiming government and diplomatic sources give 
Stratfor advance knowledge of global politics and events in exchange for
money.

'The Global 
Intelligence Files exposes how Stratfor has recruited a global network 
of informants who are paid via Swiss banks accounts and pre-paid credit 
cards,' the group said.

'Stratfor
has a mix of covert and overt informants, which includes government 
employees, embassy staff and journalists around the world.

HQ: Stratfor, based in Austin, Texas, said the release of its stolen emails was an attempt to silence and intimidate it - and vowed it would not be cowed

'The
material shows how a private intelligence agency works, and how they 
target individuals for their corporate and government clients.'

WikiLeaks
accused Stratfor of 'routine use of secret cash bribes to get 
information from insiders', and claims an email from chief executive 
George Friedman in August 2011 suggested his concern over its legality.

In it, he wrote: 'We are retaining a law firm to create a policy for Stratfor on the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

'I don't plan to do the perp walk and I don't want anyone here doing it either.'

The
group said: 'Like WikiLeaks' diplomatic cables, much of the 
significance of the emails will be revealed over the coming weeks, as 
our coalition and the public search through them and discover 
connections.'

It said Stratfor did secret deals with dozens of media organisations and journalists - from Reuters to the Kiev Post.

'While
it is acceptable for journalists to swap information or be paid by 
other media organisations, because Stratfor is a private intelligence 
organisation that services governments and private clients these 
relationships are corrupt or corrupting.'

The group said it has also obtained Stratfor's list of informants and, in many cases, records of its pay-offs.

Masked: Anonymous has hit the headlines for shutting down websites, including those of the FBI and Justice Department

Anonymous is a notorious group of hackers around the world who have no central authority.

The group was previously in the news for briefly shutting down the FBI and Justice Department websites in the
U.S. after popular file-sharing website Megaupload was closed down.

They
work by agreeing on targets in internet chat rooms and then attacking 
at the same time. One of their most famous targets that generated much 
publicity was the Church of Scientology in 2008.

Anonymous
also attacked the Amazon, Visa, MasterCard and PayPal websites in 2010 
after the companies decided to stop working with Julian Assange’s 
controversial website WikiLeaks.

They
have also attacked the websites of the Motion Picture Association of 
America and Recording Industry Association of America for tightly 
controlling copyright, reported Agence France-Presse.

Last
autumn one hacker affiliated with Anonymous was arrested for allegedly 
targeting Sony's PlayStation Network, Qriocity music streaming and Sony 
Online Entertainment.
