A shocking new revelation has been uncovered in the infamous 31-year-old mystery surrounding the death of Hollywood actress Natalie Wood.

Wood's body was found floating in the sea off Catalina Island, California on Nov 29, 1981. She had been staying on the yacht, the Splendour, along with husband Robert Wagner and their guest and fellow actor Christopher Walken.

The new discovery is the latest in a series of revelations in the case over the past couple of years.

Authorities reopened the case in 2011 
after the captain of the yacht, Dennis Davern, claimed he had originally
lied to the authorities and a new coroner's report published in January revealed that Wood sustained bruises to her face and other parts of her body before she went overboard and drowned.

Now the National Enquirer claims to have uncovered documentation - an official lifeguard log - which suggests Wagner and Walken had engaged in a sexual act and that Wood may have walked in on them and set off the chain of events which lead to her untimely and still unexplained death.

The note, which is torn and illegible in parts, reads 'also known Chris Walken and Robert Wagner were engaged in sexual activity in cab of boat... (illegible)...that Ms Woods found both of them together (illegible)...stated they took her away in a (illegible)...was the last time she was seen alive.'

The Los Angeles County lifeguard, who worked with detectives on the case, told The Enquirer he made the notes on the log after detectives told him that it was a scenario that were considering as a possible motive for any crime that might have been committed on the boat.

If legitimate, the documentation could help shed further light on the case which is remains a mystery 21 years after the tragedy occurred.

Ms Woods death was initially ruled an accidental drowning, caused by her slipping and falling from the dinghy, but authorities reopened the case in 2011.

Davern, who said he had originally lied to authorities, now claims Woods and Wagner had been fighting in the hours before her body was found.

Neither Wagner nor Walken has ever been charged in connection with the case.  

In January a new coroner's report revealed that bruises found on the actress' face, wrists, knees, and ankles occurred before she went into the water - not, as the 1981 report had concluded, as she struggled to climb back aboard the yacht after falling over the side.

Those bruises could have been 'non-accidental' and she could have been assaulted aboard the yacht, the medical examiner claimed.

Beaten: Ms Wood, seen here in 1962, had bruises on her wrists, knees and ankles that were consistent with her being beaten, according to a new coroner's report released in January

The new coroner's report poked numerous holes in the original autopsy reporting and the ruling that her death has been accidental - however it stopped short of calling her death a homicide.

Wagner's publicist, Alan Nierob, told MailOnline in January that he would not comment on the report.

Los Angeles County sheriff's detectives reopened their investigation in 2011 after the captain of the yacht claimed that Wood's husband, Robert Wagner, was with her right up until she went overboard.

Her death was ruled 'accidental' at the time, but in 2012, the coroner changed the ruling to 'undetermined.' The coroner's office said in the new report that it is not have enough evidence to rule on the manner in which Wood died.

However, the report did pay special attention to the bruises found on Wood's body.

'The location of the bruises, the multiplicity of the bruises, lack of head trauma, or facial bruising support bruising having occurred prior to entry in the water,' the report stated.

Fatal: This is the yacht Splendor that Ms Wood and Mr Wagner were aboard when the actress went overboard and drowned off Santa Catalina Island over Thanksgiving weekend in 1981

Dangerous: Ms Wood reportedly could not swim. Her body was found floating in the water near Catalina Island hours after she went overboard

Tragic: New information released in the last couple of years has cast suspicion on the original finding that Ms Wood's death was accidental (pictured here with Mr Wagner)

Confession: Dennis Davern, the skipper of the yacht, says he lied to police about what happened the night Wood drowned

'Since there are unanswered questions
and limited additional evidence available for evaluation, it is opined 
by this Medical Examiner that the manner of death should be left as 
undetermined,' Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Lakshmanan Sathyavagiswaran 
wrote in the report completed last June.

Wagner has told investigators that 
Wood, who could not swim, must have fallen in the water when she got up 
to try to retie a dingy that had been knocking against the side of the 
yacht.

He is not considered a suspect by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office.

Wood's body was found to have a blood
alcohol content of 0.14 percent, nearly twice the legal limit for 
driving. She was also found to be under the influence of a motion 
sickness medication and a painkiller, which likely increased her level 
of intoxication.

Her body was found floating off Catalina Island, near Los Angeles, several hours later.

The
captain of the yacht, Dennis Davern, told '48 Hours' and the 'Today' show last year that he heard Mr Wagner and Ms Wood arguing the night of her disappearance and believed Mr Wagner was to blame for her death.

He said that after Wood went to bed, he heard the fight continuing in her cabin, including sounds of a physical struggle.

He also claimed that a fight had broken 
out between Wagner and actor Christopher Walken, who was also aboard to 
yacht.

Mr Davern claims Wagner waited several hours after his wife disappeared to call authorities.

Wood, 43, rose to stardom in 1947 playing little Susie, the girl who didn't believe in Santa Claus, in 'Miracle on 34th Street.'

She later starred as Maria in 1961's 'West Side Story' and was nominated for an Oscar for her role opposite James Dean in 'Rebel Without a Cause.'

Wagner, now 82, admitted he had a fight with his wife on the night of November 28, 1981, but said she was not in her cabin when he went to bed.

He maintains he had nothing to do with her death, though said he feels personally responsible for not looking after her.

However, Davern reportedly offered an alternate explanation for Wood's death. Lana Wood, the actress' young sister, claimed to author Suzanne Finstad that Davern called her and drunkenly confessed that Wagner allowed his wife to drown.

'He said it appeared to him as though (Wagner) shoved her away and she went overboard. Dennis panicked and (Wagner) said, "Leave her there. Teach her a lesson." Dennis said he was very panicky that he was sitting and (Wagner) kept drinking and kept drinking.

‘And he’d say, "Come on, let’s get her." And he said (Wagner) was in such a foul mood, at that point, that he then shut up and was waiting for when, when are they gonna go to her rescue, until all the sound stopped,’ Lana is heard telling Finstad in recordings make for her 2001 book Natasha: The Biography of Natalie Wood.

Lana continues on to say that Davern did not think that Wagner meant for Wood to die but he did not ‘run to her aid.’

'Even if he did not kill her, which is what I understand the guy’s saying, it was – you know, that it – it was an accident,' Lana said.

In January investigators also revealed that Robert Wagner has declined to be interviewed for the latest inquiry.

Detectives began re-investigating the case in November 2011. Investigators interviewed more than 100 people – including Mr Walken - but Mr Wagner refused and Sheriff's Lt. John Corina has said the actor's representatives have not given any reason for his silence.

The setup: On November 28, 1981, the 60-foot yacht Splendor set out for Santa Catalina Island, a rocky island off the coast of California, 22 miles from Los Angeles. Aboard were Robert Wagner, Natalie Wood and the boat's skipper, Dennis Davern. The couple also brought Wood's newest costar, Christopher Walken, to celebrate their successful completion of filming for 'Brainstorm,' a science fiction thriller.

Wood, Wagner and Walken departed the yacht and rode a dingy to shore, where they had dinner at Harbor Reef Resultant on the island. Waitresses reported that all three Hollywood actors drank heavily - mostly champagne - and were rude and boisterous.

Witnesses say all three were very intoxicated about 10.15pm when they piloted the dingy back to the yacht, which was anchored offshore.

Exactly what happened after the three returned to the boat remains a mystery.

The tragedy: Wood's body was found floating in the water about a mile from the yacht about 8am on November 29 and the coroner determined that she had died of a combination of drowning and hypothermia.

Her blood alcohol level at the time was 
0.14percent - nearly twice the legal limit for driving. She also had 
motion sickness medication and painkillers in her system, which likely 
increased her level of intoxication.

The time of death is estimated at about midnight at on November 29.

'The fact that her stomach contained 500 cc of partially digested food material supports that opinion of that time of death being around midnight, especially given the information that dinner was consumed between 8 and 9pm,' according to the new report.

However, Wood was not reported missing until 1.30am - fully 90 minutes after she went overboard, according to an interview with the manager of the restaurant on shore.
