A teenager from Kentucky was shot and killed by the dumped boyfriend of her aunt.

Robert Harmon, 48, ended up taking his own life after killing 16-year-old Carlin Davis and shooting at his former girlfriend, the girls' aunt Nikki Davis, with whom they had both been living.

Davis and Harmon had been dating for about three years before they broke up earlier this month.

State police say Davis moved out of the home after the break-up, but went back on Saturday and argued with his ex

Harmon shot Carlin and his former girlfriend Nikki, 33, before killing himself around 2 a.m. on Sunday.

Carlin Davis and Harmon were pronounced dead at the scene.

Nikki Davis was taken to the University of Louisville hospital with two gunshot wounds to the face.

She was conscious and talking when police arrived at the scene. She remains in serious condition but her injuries are not considered to be life threatening.

Kentucky State Police believe Carlin had recently moved into the home on Garriott Court, a quiet cul-de-sac neighborhood where her aunt lived.

Police say the couple shared the home on Gariott Court. Davis' niece had been staying with the couple for several months. Authorities aren't sure why or how the teen was caught up in the shooting.

Deadly: Carlin Davis, 16, was shot and killed by Robert Harmon, 48. Harmon also shot his ex (Carlin's aunt) Nikki Davis, 33, in the face - however she is expected to survive

Gone too soon: Carlin Davis, according to her mother, was a little girl with big dreams. She was a typical teenager who was into fashion and loved to take selfies

Paul Moceika worked with Davis at a local gas station. He said Harmon came to the store Saturday evening, before the shooting, and nothing seemed out of the ordinary.

'There was no signs anything like this was going to happen,' said Moceika to WDRB. 'He was in here, he was normal, he was fine.'

Troopers have never responded to any domestic or violence-related calls to the house.

'You can't predict something like this,' Trooper Brad Arterburn said. 'Just want to tell people - get away from each other and cool down. That's the best advice you can give, but obviously it doesn't happen sometimes.'

A funeral is being held for Carlin on Thursday. The family didn't have any insurance and are looking for financial help to cover the cost.

Trimble County Sheriff's Deputy Tom Starks says that plans are being made for a local memorial service to allow students to remember their classmate.

Carlin had several friends at the high school even though she had just transferred to the district.

She would have been a junior at the high school this fall.
