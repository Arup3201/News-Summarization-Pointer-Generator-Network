Two men who mimicked the plot of the cult movie Weekend At Bernie's when they carted their dead friend around to bars and used his credit card at a strip club, have pleaded guilty to abuse of a corpse.

The night of mayhem occurred in Denver, Colorado, on August 27 when Robert Jeffrey Young, 43, and Mark Rubinson, 25, put Jeffrey Jarrett, 43 - who they believed had passed out - into the back of Rubinson's Lincoln Navigator.

They then headed to a bar and restaurant where they used Mr Jarrett's credit card. At one point, Young and Rubinson allegedly withdrew $400 from an ATM at a strip club.

Then, when they realized Mr Jarrett was dead, they took him back to his house and left the body in a bedroom.

However, Young and Rubinson then made several more stops where they continued to charge Jarrett's card.

Mr Jarrett's cause of death is unknown, but Young and
Rubinson have never been considered suspects.

The case has often been compared to the 1989 cult comedy
film Weekend At Bernie’s, where a quirky pair pretend that their boss is alive
in order to make their party last longer.

They both pleaded guilty to the abuse of a corpse, and are
due to be sentenced on March 8.

Young also admitted identity theft which carries a sentence
up to six years, said Lynn Kimbrough, spokesman for the Denver District
Attorney's Office.
