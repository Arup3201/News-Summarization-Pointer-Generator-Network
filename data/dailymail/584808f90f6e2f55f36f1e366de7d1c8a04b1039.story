A Spanish artist has turned his hands into a mobile garden, by using his palms as plant pots.

David Catá, from Viveiro, in Galicia, Spain, is making it look like his skin is a living, walking rosebush for his project 'Winged Roots'.

Mr Cata, 21, who now lives in Berlin creates the 'plant pot effect' by making a pocket of skin on his palm, removing the outer layer in a similar way to a blister.

He then fills the skin pocket with dirt, and places the stem of a rose inside it.

In one of the photographs he has also attached roots to back of his hand, making it look like the rose is growing through his palm. 

'This determination was an important step in my life, seeing myself forced to leave many things behind to start a new life in an unknown place with new people and a completely different language,' Mr Cata told the Huffington Post.

'I felt like my feet slowly lifted off the ground, leaving their estate to begin flying.'

Mr Cata got the idea for the palm 'plant pots' series after he moved from Spain to Berlin, Germany

'A superficial pocket has been peeled away from the epidermis, soil inserted, and vegetation tucked within, transforming the human hand into a source of life for the natural growth.'

Earlier this year, Mr Cata used his body as a canvas for his project Overexposed Emotions, which saw him stitching portraits of his family, friends and girlfriend into the palms of his hands.

Each eye-watering artwork took him about four hours to complete, after which he filmed himself picking the stitches out of his hands. 

'By sewing into the palm of my hand I paint the faces of the people that have left their mark on my life: family, friends, partners, teachers,' Mr Cata said at the time.

'Their lives have been interwoven with mine to build my history. Pain is no boundary.'

Mr Cata created around 20 of the artworks featuring friends and family, such as his brother Javier
