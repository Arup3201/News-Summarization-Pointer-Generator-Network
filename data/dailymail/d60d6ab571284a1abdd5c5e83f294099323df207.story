Alexis Sanchez and Angel di Maria were two of the weekend’s standout performers as Arsenal were held to a draw and Manchester United gave the Old Trafford faithful something to cheer.

The South Americans, both big money additions to their respective  Premier League giants, found the net for new clubs.

But where Di Maria dominated from his preferred left side in United's 4-0 trouncing of QPR, super-fit Sanchez was all over the place for Arsenal in their 2-2 draw with Manchester City.

Chilean Alexis Sanchez's biggest weak point in the match was getting a yellow card for a shirtless celebration

For United, Di Maria was a threat every time he had the ball at his feet, especially in space. The Argentine though, more renowned for his lethal crossing, was excellent feeding his fellow forwards - Wayne Rooney in particular. Of his 76 passes, 14 of them were long, with total accuracy of 80.3 per cent - a figure which dropped to 69.4 per cent in the attacking half when risks were more acceptable. 

Chilean Sanchez's passing numbers were never going to compare with Di Maria, with Arsenal having just 45.3 per cent of possession compared to United's 69 per cent. The Gunners' utility forward made 46 passes with a 60.9 per cent success rate.  

It was his workload that most impressed though, a he chased everything in sight and dragged City's defence into areas they may not have wanted to venture into. Starting on the left and spending spells on the right and up front when Welbeck went off, Sanchez is an undoubted asset for Arsene Wenger.
