An Iraq veteran is angry and upset with U.S. Airways after he says he and his service dog were mistreated on a recent flight from Florida to Detroit.

Ex-Marine Eric Calley, from Williamston, Michigan, suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after serving two tours of duty.

His constant companion nowadays is a Doberman pinscher called Sun, who is specially trained to help him with his PTSD.She goes everywhere with him including on the December 7 flight.

Calley was sitting in coach when a flight attendant from first class walked over and repeatedly yelled at him because Sun had put her front paws on an empty seat next to him during some turbulence.

The flight attendant was so apparently rude that a dozen or so passengers got involved and some filed complaints when they landed.

'It was blatant disrespect. I couldn't just sit there and not say something,' said Chuck Aaron of Charlotte, Mich., who also served in Iraq.

'He [the flight attendant] started telling us that he was going to have the police waiting when we landed because we were being hostile,' Aaron told the Lansing State Journal.

U.S. Airways apologized this week and sent Calley a letter saying 'it appears our airport personnel didn't handle the situation with the quality customer care we expect.'

But Calley has said the apology isn't good enough and that the attendant's bad behavior was just one of example of how the airline mistreated him.

He says airline employees twice described him to other passengers as having a medical disability and also asked him to provide proof that Sun is a service dog.

Calley, who works as an advocate on behalf of other returning veterans, has said he is speaking out about his experience because he wants to raise awareness about the lack of recognition given to vets with PTSD and how it is a growing problem.

'We are going to continue to have this huge influx of new veterans coming back,' he said.

Calley, who was part of the first wave of American troops who invaded Iraq in 2003, said it took him several years of struggling to adjust to normal life after he left the Marines.

During that time he battled alcoholism to cope flashbacks and panic attacks, but says Sun has rescued him.

'Dogs are 10 times more intuitive than humans. They pick up things way more than we do,' he said.

U.S. Airways apologized this week but Calley isn't happy and says his treatment is typical of the lack of recognition given to the needs of vets with PTSD

Sun monitors his heart rate, breathing, the tension in his muscles and can help calm him down by wedging her snout under his arm to calm him or jumping into his lap to put warm pressure on his chest. 

If Calley has a nightmare, Sun wakes him up with a nudge of her cold nose. 

'If you have a flashback, and say you're dreaming you're overseas and you wake up, you still think you're over there for a while. She helps you get out of that. She brings you back to real time,' he said.

Leslie Scott, a spokeswoman for the airline's parent company American Airlines, wouldn't comment on whether any disciplinary action was taken against the flight attendant.

She said several airline employees, many of whom are veterans, volunteer with a program called Puppies in Flight to acclimate service dogs to flying.
