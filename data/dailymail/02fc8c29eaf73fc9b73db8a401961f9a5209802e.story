Forty fish have died in the cold after a council stored them in an old skip during repair work to a pond.

Brighton and Hove City Council transferred the fish to a temporary home inside a rubbish skip, but the water was not kept fresh enough.

The RSPCA said it had warned the council to move the 
fish to a more suitable container after finding them stored in skips.

The council is now working with the RSPCA to 'learn valuable lessons for the future'.

The fish were among about 1,000 which lived in Brighton's Preston Park pond.

Strategic Director for Brighton & Hove City Council, Geoff Raw, said: 'This is a very regrettable situation.

'Unfortunately we have lost some fish in the course of the urgent repair works to the park and pond - around 40.

'We thought we had made good plans and preparations for temporarily storing the fish on-site in specially-insulated skips which were specifically chosen as they are hard to vandalise.

'However freezing weather meant we couldn't refresh the water regularly without causing an ice hazard on the path and cycle track nearby.

'We have been in contact with the RSPCA, to review what happened and have learnt some valuable lessons for the future.

'Staff are very upset as they are keen conservationists and would never have wanted this.'

At the beginning of January the pond began undergoing repairs for the first time in two decades. It was being drained after springing a leak.

It is believed that when the temperature dropped the water in the skips 
was not being oxygenated which led to several fish perishing.

An RSPCA spokesman said: 'The RSPCA was called by a concerned member of the public who had seen dead fish floating in the skips.

'We contacted the council and told them that they were not providing a suitable environment for the fish and arrangements were made to move the remaining fish to a nearby facility with ponds.

'We did not have enough evidence to prosecute the council but are assisting them with their inquiries into what went wrong.'

The pond had perch, coy carp and goldfish living in it.
