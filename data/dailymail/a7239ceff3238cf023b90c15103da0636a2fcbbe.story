Labour unions in recession-hit Greece are holding another general strike against the country's harsh austerity program, as European leaders beset by the debt crisis gather for a summit meeting in Brussels.

Today's strike - the 20th national stoppage since the debt crisis erupted two years ago - comes as EU leaders meet in Brussels.

It has closed down public services and severely hampered most forms of transport with even taxi drivers joining in for nine hours. Shopkeepers in Athens and other cities are also closing for the day.

It is the second general strike in less than a month.

Schools and tax offices are closed

services are also disrupted.

Athens
 police are already dealing with rioting, as once again the 
protests have turned violent with masked anarchists fighting police.

Unions organised two separate marches in central Athens. Demonstrators' ire is focusing on new belt-tightening for 2013-14, demanded by bailout creditors to release a desperately needed new rescue loan payment.

The city has seen hundreds of anti-austerity protests - many violent - over the past three years, since Greece revealed it had been misreporting key deficit figures and sank into an economic gloom so deep it has been likened to the Great Depression of the 1930s.

A leading German think-tank has warned that a 
euro exit by Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy would cost the world £14trillion and trigger the worst recession ever known.

Given
 that the UK's national debt is £1.4trillion, the size of the cut in 
global GDP is truly colossal and would create suffering on a scale never
 before seen.

A Greek euro exit alone would be manageable, but 
must be avoided to forestall a domino effect, said Economic research 
group Prognos in a study commissioned by the Bertelsmann Foundation.

The
 researchers didn't just calculate the losses of creditors who had lent 
money to the crisis-hit nations, they included the likely impact of a 
euro collapse on economic growth in the 42 most important industrial and
 emerging economies constituting 90 per cent of the global economy.

'In
 their overall assessment, the authors of the study come to the 
conclusion that an isolated exit of Greece and an insolvency of this 
euro-zone country might well be something that the EU could cope with 
from a merely economic point of view,' the Bertelsmann Foundation said.

'At
 the same time, however, it is extremely difficult to assess if and to 
what extent this might trigger a wave of further euro-zone exits in 
Europe's south.

'If so, the implications for the global economy could be 
devastating.'

The country is clinging to solvency with the help of two massive international bailouts worth a total 240billion euros.

To secure them, it committed to drastic spending cuts, tax hikes and reforms, aimed to cure years of profligate government spending.

But while significantly reducing budget deficits, the measures accelerated a recession that after five years is closer to a depression.

The protests in Greece come as German Chancellor Angela Merkel called for stronger central powers to intervene when EU member states break budget rules.

Speaking ahead of a summit at Brussels, she rebuffed demands for the quick creation of a pan-European bank supervisor.

In a speech to the lower house of parliament, Mrs Merkel put herself on a collision course with French Socialist President Francois Hollande and others, who are reluctant to cede sovereignty over fiscal policy and want the European Central Bank (ECB) to get new watchdog powers by the end of the year.

Voicing support Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble's idea of a European 'currency commissioner', she said: 'We are of the opinion - and I speak for the whole German government on this - that we could go a step further by giving Europe real rights of intervention in national budgets.'

On banking supervision, she said 
quality must come before speed, reiterating her view that rushing to 
meet a January 2013 target date for giving the ECB new powers was a 
recipe for disaster.

Mrs Merkel also made clear that 
funnelling aid directly to European banks from the bloc's new rescue 
mechanism, the ESM, could not happen until the new supervisory body was 
fully operational.

The urgency of the situation is clear
 - by the end of next year, the Greek economy is expected to have shrunk
 by about a quarter from 2008 levels. And with one in four workers out 
of a job, Greece has the worst unemployment rate in the 27-nation 
European Union.

China's
 economic growth tumbled to the lowest in more than three years in the 
latest quarter, but retail sales and investment improved in a possible 
sign a painful slump might be stabilising.

The world's 
second-largest economy grew 7.4 per cent in the three months ending in 
September, data showed today.

That was down from the previous 
quarter's 7.6 per cent and the lowest since the first quarter of 2009.

Retail
 sales rose 14.4 per cent, a small acceleration over the first half of 
the year, and investment in industrial assets and some other indicators 
also showed small improvements.

Sheng 
Laiyun, spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics, said: 'Judging from the third quarter 
figures, we can see a clear sign of steady economic growth.

'There is a smaller margin of decline and some major 
indicators have been growing faster.'

Analysts expect China's 
economic growth to rebound late this year or early next year but say a 
recovery is likely to be too weak to drive global growth without 
improvement in the U.S. and Europe.

'In general, we're going from bad to worse,' said 85-year-old pensioner Giorgos Ierodimos. 'Salaries are being reduced, pensions are being reduced, everything is getting more expensive, from food to health care to hospitals, medicines, everything. So how will people live? How will we live?'

The country's four-month-old coalition government is negotiating a new austerity package with debt inspectors from the EU, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and European Central Bank (ECB).

The idea is to save 11billion euros in spending - largely on pensions and health care - and raise an extra 2.5billion euros through taxes.

After more than a month-and-a-half of arguing, a deal seems close. On Wednesday, the EU, IMF and ECB troika said there was agreement on 'most of the core measures needed to restore the momentum of reform' and that the rest of the issues should be resolved in coming days. 

Athens hopes to get the next loan installment around mid-November, shortly after which it will run out of cash. That would probably force Greece to default on its mountain of debt and potentially abandon the 17-strong eurozone.

Unions say the cost of securing the money is too high.

Ilias Iliopoulos, secretary-general of the ADEDY civil servant union, said: 'What people can shoulder new measures, when approximately 70 per cent of it is caught between poverty and destitution? It is absolutely impossible.

'On the noteworthy day of the summit in Brussels, we want to tell the leaders of the European Union "That's enough. We can't take any more."

'This is not worthy of Europe. It is a policy of exploitation, of profiteers and loan sharks.'
