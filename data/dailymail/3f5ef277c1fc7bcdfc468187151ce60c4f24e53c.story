Moors murderer Ian Brady was rushed to hospital after falling and breaking his hip inside his high-security facility, it was revealed today.

The killer, 76, suffered two broken bones in the accident and is currently said to be in a stable condition.

Brady was taken by ambulance six miles from Ashworth Hospital, in Maghull, Merseyside, to Aintree University Hospital, Liverpool.

Appeal: Ian Brady at a mental health tribunal last year when he was seen in public for the first time since the 1980s. He was appealing for the right to be released

The incident happened just days after it was claimed that the Moors Murderer may be suffering from the early stages of dementia.

He was last seen in public last year at a week-long mental health tribunal as he applied to be released from custody for the first time since 1966. His case was rejected.

Jackie Powell, the Moors Murderer's self-styled mental health advocate, said his behaviour had become increasingly bizarre and medical experts believed he was now seriously ill.

The revelation has prompted fears that he may become unable to remember where he buried Keith Bennett, the only one of his five young victims whose remains have never been found.

Brady, 76, was jailed for life in 1966 along with his girlfriend Myra Hindley for abducting, abusing, torturing and killing five youngsters in Manchester before burying them on nearby Saddleworth Moor.

He has been held at Ashworth high-security psychiatric hospital in Liverpool since 1985.

Miss Powell, who has visited Brady regularly since 1999, said that during a recent meeting with him she saw signs of dementia, and believed he was nearing the end of his life.

But she said that Brady would not accept that there was anything wrong and refused to undergo tests that could confirm whether he has Alzheimer's disease.

Miss Powell said that Brady had withdrawn into himself, and that he now seems to be ‘waiting to die’.She also said she believed it highly unlikely he would ever reveal where Keith Bennett is buried, saying that he refuses to even discuss it.

A spokesman for Ashworth Hospital confirmed that the 76-year-old has been taken to hospital.

'Ian Brady was admitted to a general hospital yesterday for 
treatment for two broken bones suffered following a fall,' he said.

'He remained in hospital overnight and his condition today is stable.'

Along with Hindley - who died in jail aged 60 in 2002 - Brady killed Pauline Reade, 16, John Kilbride, 12, Keith Bennett, 12, Lesley Ann Downey, 10, and Edward Evans, 17, between 1963 and 1965.
