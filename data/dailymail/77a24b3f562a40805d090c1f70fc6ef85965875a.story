The Walmart truck driver who smashed into comedian Tracy Morgan's limo van - seriously injuring him and two others and killing another man - was speeding before the crash, a report has revealed.

The preliminary report released on Thursday by the National Transportation Safety Board said that trucker Kevin Roper was driving 65 mph for the 60 seconds before the June 7 crash.

But about a half-mile south of the crash on the northbound New Jersey Turnpike, signs advised drivers to slow from 55 mph to 45 mph because of construction ahead, the report said.

Questions: Kevin Roper, in court on June 11, was driving the truck that hit a limo van on June 7, killing one man and injuring comedian Tracy Morgan. On Thursday, a preliminary report by the NTSB revealed that he had been speeding

The NTSB used the truck's electronic engine-control system to calculate how fast Roper was driving.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc. trucks are equipped with devices that limit the vehicles' speed to 65 mph, a spokeswoman said, so Roper was going at the top speed possible.

Drivers are required to follow the posted speed limit under Wal-Mart policy, spokeswoman Brooke Buchanan said on Thursday.

'Of course we expect our drivers to comply with the laws, whether it's a speed limit, or (something else),' she said. 'We don't condone speeding.'

In the report, officials also said that Roper had been on duty for 13 hours and 32 minutes, which is half an hour below the federal limit. He had been driving for nine hours and 37 minutes.

A criminal complaint also alleged that
 he had not slept for more than 24 hours before the crash, but the NTSB 
said in its report that it is still investigating how much rest he had.

It concluded that Roper left a 
Wal-Mart facility in Smyrna, Delaware, at about 11.30am on June 6 and 
made stops in Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania during the day.

Just
 after midnight on June 7 he left Bristol, Pennsylvania, en route to 
Perth Amboy, New Jersey, when the crash happened about 30 minutes into 
his trip.

The truck 
struck Morgan's limo from behind, sending it into other vehicles and 
eventually onto its side. The limo van was carrying Morgan and six 
others.

The 45-year-old
 former 'Saturday Night Live' and '30 Rock' star suffered broken ribs 
and a broken leg, while his friend and fellow comedian James McNair, 63,
 was killed.

Just before his
 death, McNair, who was laid to rest in Peeskill, New York last week, 
had been helping Morgan work on material for his new stand-up routine.

This week, Morgan's condition was upgraded to fair condition.

'His personality is certainly starting to come back as well,' spokesman Lewis Kay said.

Morgan's
 assistant, Jeffrey Millea, has also been upgraded to fair condition, 
Kay said. Hospital officials said comedian Ardie Fuqua remains in 
critical condition.

Comedian Harris Stanton, 37, was released from hospital last week with a broken wrist.

New 
Jersey prosecutors have charged Roper, who is from Jonesboro, Georgia, 
with vehicular homicide and assault, but he has pleaded not guilty.

A conviction on a death by auto charge
 carries a five to 10-year prison sentence. Each assault by auto charge 
is punishable by up to 18 months in prison.

Following a hearing earlier this month, Roper, 35, was released on $50,000 bail.

Roper,
 who is from Jonesboro, Georgia, was driving the truck for Wal-Mart, 
which said its trucks are equipped with devices that limit speed to 65 
mph.
