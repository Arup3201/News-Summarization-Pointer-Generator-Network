Princess Beatrice and her little sister Eugenie are often the subject of heated debate when it comes to understanding what it is some members of the Royal family actually do... and how they make themselves useful.

But having spent two days enjoying herself at Royal Ascot with other members of her family - including her grandmother the Queen and her father Prince Andrew - today the young princess, 24, who graduated from Goldsmiths, University of London, in 2011 with a 2:1, decided to prove she can earn her keep.

So the fifth in line to the throne put away her elaborate hats, folded up her elegantly bejeweled dresses, donned her smartest, most serious attire, and travelled to Halifax, West Yorkshire, to officially open the new Trinity Academy school and then visit the Forget Me Not Children's Hospice and attend a luncheon and fashion show at The University of Huddersfield.

Touring the newly built academy, the princess, who battled dyslexia when she attended Upton House School in Windsor, Coworth Park School in Surrey and St. George's School in Ascot, said: 'I wish I came to a school like this'.

During her 50 minute tour of the academy,
 Beatrice was given a demonstration by the Trinity Tigers cheerleading 
team, she sat in on a science class and seemed particularly interested 
in the dressmaking sessions in the open-plan art-and-design studios.

Later, her reactions were fast enough to 
catch the mini-curtain she pulled back to reveal the plaque to mark her 
visit, when it collapsed at the crucial moment.

The young royal looked genuinely impressed by the Academy's state-of-the-art facilities, and as hundreds of students gathered in the 
main atrium, she told the whole school: 'I have never spoken to this 
many people before. It is quite amazing.'

One student said of the princess: 'It was 
strange seeing her after only seeing her in photographs. It was 
exciting. I don't know how she walked in those heels down those stairs'

Speaking without notes, she said: 'I'm so honoured to be here today. I'm so honoured to see this amazing place.

'You're so lucky to be in an academy like this, to be in a school like this, where everything can be brought together, where young people can be taught these amazing life skills in this incredible space.

'And I thank everyone who has made this possible, to bring this community together and to make this building as spectacular as it is and to give you all the most amazing opportunities that young people deserve in the UK.'

She continued: 'I'm just so excited to be here. I've seen so many of the classes - the science, the performance, the cheerleaders - I mean, I wish came to a school like this.'

Her joke was greeted with laughter and applause.

Reminiscing, the princess told the children: 'Enjoy every moment of school. It is the best time.'

She confessed she was not very good at science and, as she complimented some of the students on their 'amazing' art work, admitted: 'I ended up doing a sculpture. I took it home and it disintegrated.'

The princess wore a navy blue jacket over a white blouse and a royal blue skirt with navy blue shoes.

Academy principal Michael Gosling said: 'All the way round the princess was talking about how school wasn't like this when she went to school.'

He said: 'In the build up to the visit the student have been very giddy. This morning, excitement was at fever pitch. They were really looking forward to the visit.'

Mr Gosling said: 'Her down-to-earth approach came through. And she caught the curtain as well.'

Student Amy Moran, 17, said: 'It was strange seeing her after only seeing her in photographs. It was exciting. I don't know how she walked in those heels down those stairs.'

The visit to the school was the first part of a three-stop tour of West Yorkshire for the princess today.

She also visited Huddersfield University and open the Forget Me Not Children's Hospice, also in Huddersfield.

Today will be quite a change of scene 
for the Queen's granddaughter, who for the past two days has been at 
Royal Ascot in Berkshire with her family

The princess announced recently that she will be focusing on her career in finance rather than royal engagements

The day will be quite a change of scene for the Queen's granddaughter, who for the past two days has been at Royal Ascot in Berkshire with her family.

Yesterday Princess Beatrice was pictured celebrating jubilantly in the Royal box when the Queen's horse Estimate shot round the course to win the Gold Cup for the monarch.

Last weekend she attended the Trooping of the Colour in London on Saturday, riding in the carriage with her sister Eugenie, and on Sunday she went to the Cartier Queen's Cup polo tournament final at Guards Polo in Windsor Great Park, Berkshire, with her boyfriend of seven years Dave Clark.

It was recently announced that the princess will be focusing more on a career in finance than royal engagements and duties, so today's visits will be some of the small handful she will perform this year.
