A young Chinese woman has appeared to document on Instagram the final moments before she committed suicide by jumping out of her high-rise apartment window.

'I will haunt you day and night after I'm dead,' jojostai1012, from Shanghai, told her ex-boyfriend on the photo-sharing app before uploading a shot of a pile of her belongings burning and another of her legs dangling perilously out a window with a carpark many stories below.

It's not completely clear what happened next, but Chinese forum Mop shared a photo of what appears to be a woman's body lying in a pool of water in a carpark with police investigating the scene.

Tragic: This young Chinese woman has appeared to document on Instagram her final moments before she committed suicide by jumping out her high-rise apartment window

The shape of the carpark resembles the one seen beneath her feet in the picture she uploaded and, according to the DailyDot, a person claiming to be her neighbor confirmed the suicide in a comment.

'This is real, we live in the same building, she died Saturday morning,' the person wrote. 'No matter what, how much courage must it have taken for a little girl to kill herself? Hope she will find peace in the afterlife.'

Another man, claiming to be her friend, mourned her loss online, and posted a screen shot of a text message conversation he appeared to have had with the girl earlier, where she told him she was 'going to leave.'

Ashes: The girl posted a photograph, seen here, of a pile of her belongings going up in flames with the caption, 'Let it burn, all the things like ashes float away'

The sorry story began about two weeks
 ago, when the young woman started posting photos with worrying captions
 detailing her devastation at a recent break up.

Instead of raising the alarm and potentially saving her life, her 
followers simply liked the pictures or wrote shallow comments 
underneath.

'Life has been so miserable these 
past few days,' she wrote alongside one picture. 'I want to forget all 
of this, to control my mood and not be crying painfully late at night 
every night, but I can’t do it, there’s nothing I can do. All of this is
 too unfair to me, I can't bear it.'

Next to a picture of a young man, presumably her ex, she wrote: 'I never thought that you'd deceive me, but I still love you.'

Deceit: Next to a picture of this young man, presumably her ex, she wrote: 'I never thought that you'd deceive me, but I still love you'

Sad: The girl wrote next to this picture, 'I will haunt you day and night after I'm dead'

She
 then piled her possessions on her bed and set them alight, with the 
caption 'Let it burn, all the things like ashes float away.'

She writes how since the break up, 
which happened at the beginning of March, she has been 
unable to eat or sleep and cries all the time.

She
 says she has gone out with other guys who are more handsome and wealthy
 than her ex but 'my heart is unable to accept anyone else.'

The
 young girl then asks why he rejected her after giving her so much hope 
and making so many promises, which later turned out to be 'a lie.'

No support: Despite the sheer level of devastation in the captions, most of the comments provide little support for the beautiful girl;, pictured

'All of this I cannot forget, can never forget, unless I die,' she wrote.

Despite the sheer level of devastation in the captions, most of the comments provide little support and it seems that no one flagged up her unstable state to someone who could help.

Though her friend and neighbor appear to have confirmed the suicide, it's impossible to tell whether it occurred or if the story is a hoax because the woman hasn't been named and there are no reports of a similar suicide in the Shanghai media. However, it's unclear if such an event would be reported.
