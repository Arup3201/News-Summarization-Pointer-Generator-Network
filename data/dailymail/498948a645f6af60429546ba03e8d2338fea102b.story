A high street fashion chain has been forced to withdraw a popular range of home furnishings from sale as the artwork on the curtains, rugs and cushions resembles a penis.

The watercolour range of goods was on sale on Next's website and in store with items on offer for as much as £125.

One man noticed the design mistake after his mother had purchased the new curtains and hung them in his bedroom.

The controversial range of curtains and cushions featured an original watercolour design, pictured  

Unfortunately for Next, the flower image altered slightly in the manufacturing process with amusing results 

Scott Godfrey said: 'How do you manage to make private parts when they're supposed to be flowers?'

Scott Godfrey from Ipswich told the Daily Star: 'After taking a close look at the curtains my mum had bought, I couldn’t help noticing they seemed to include pictures of, well, men’s genitalia. I can’t believe no-one at Next is aware of this. How do you manage to make private parts when they’re supposed to be flowers?”

A spokesperson for Next admitted the company had made a mistake and would withdraw the range from sale. 'Thank you for drawing attention to this. 

'The design was based on an original watercolour painting and unfortunately the way the watercolour paint has dried has given the illusion of something that was not intended, we are not continuing with this design on any products.'

In July, the company was forced to apologise to the parents of twin girls Evelyn and Amelia Gallivan after their father Shane, 23, spotted the image of a penis on his daughters' baby grow. 

Mr Gallivan saw the penis image on the clothes as they were hanging on the washing line. 

His wife Carla, 24, said: 'He was feeding my daughter when he suddenly said "oh my god",' said the insurance worker. 'He looked at the baby grow and noticed the trousers were covered in penises.

Scott Godfey took a photograph of the 'offending image' which he claims does not look like a flower 

'At first I thought it must just be a mistake, but I looked and there are lots of different ones all over it.

'It just looks like the designer was having a laugh and no one spotted it. I was angry because it's not the kind of thing you should be dressing a baby in.'

Next, which stocks hundreds of baby clothes, later admitted the drawing of a jumper had ended up looking like a penis because of a misprint.

Mr and Mrs Gallivan had been given a packet of the baby grows as a present four months ago, but had only recently noticed the design flaw.

They are now refusing to dress their twin daughters in them.

'We aren't going to keep it and keep dressing the girls in it,' said Mrs Gallivan. 'I think what makes it all worse is that I have dressed two girls in it, not just that I put it on a baby.

'The girls were wearing it for weeks before we noticed. We don't tend to look in depth at the clothes.

'We just thought it was a cute, nice baby grow with washing line with clothes and socks on it, but then we saw this. Once you notice it, it is unmistakeable.'

A spokesman for Next said the offending design was pulled from shelves after they received another complaint about the item.

In a statement, the store said: 'We were shocked by the image that ended up on one of our sleepsuits.

'The offending part of the design started life as an upside down jumper with a neck binding and placket with buttons (hanging on the washing line), but unfortunately has been over simplified by the printer and has unintentionally become something else.

'This is an innocent mistake that had not been picked up in the approval process. As it was inappropriate we made the decision to withdraw this item from sale as soon as it was bought to our attention earlier this year.'
