Tearing open the wrapping on the gifts under her grandmother’s tree, Lulah Rae Smith squeals with delight at her new cuddly toys – Olaf the snowman and his donkey sidekick Sven from Disney’s hit film Frozen.

Christmas for this two-year-old has come early this year, but there is good reason for Lulah’s parents Tariq and Lisa choosing to spoil their daughter. 

For as other children open gifts on December 25, Lulah will be in hospital receiving a life-saving blood transfusion – her 31st such treatment since being diagnosed with a rare disorder, hereditary spherocytosis, within hours of being born.

'This is number 30': Lulah Rae Smith, pictured with a sign indicating her 30th blood transfusion, will spend Christmas Day receiving her 31st such treatment 

The disease causes the spleen – part of the immune system – to destroy red blood cells rather than create them. Red blood cells are vital for carrying oxygen around the body. While a mild reduction in numbers, typically caused by a nutritional deficiency, simply causes fatigue or sometimes pain, in severe cases the organs can quickly become irreversibly damaged.

Lulah’s first transfusion came when she was just 20 days old, and without having one every five weeks she would die.

She is just one of thousands of patients who will need transfusions over the festive period, which is why NHS Blood and Transplant is urging would-be donors not to put off giving blood until the New Year – as many do – or miss their regular scheduled appointments.

Tariq, 39, a production engineer for a plastics company, explains: ‘From day one we’ve seen how much Lulah needs that blood. Towards the end of the five-weekly cycle, she loses all her energy. Then almost immediately after her transfusion it’s like she’s been recharged.

‘To think that strangers have given us this gift of life month after month is incredible. All our friends and family are donors and I do everything I can to encourage more people to donate, especially at this time of year when stocks can run low.’

There are about one million regular blood donors in England and North Wales who have given blood at least once in the past year. Appointment dates are generated automatically by computer.

But last year, a fifth of appointments were missed over the festive period – a figure that could be even higher this year as Christmas Day and Boxing Day are followed by the weekend.

Blood can’t be frozen, and once donated it lasts for only 35 days. Platelets – a constituent of blood commonly used to help those with leukaemia or other cancers – last for just seven days. ‘Because of this turnover, more than 6,000 donors are needed every single day of the year. It’s tough to maintain stocks at the best of times,’ says Jon Latham, of NHS Blood and Transplant.

There is pressure on stocks of certain blood types, particularly O RhD Negative as it can be received by those of all blood types in situations where there isn’t time to determine type, such as after a road accident.

Mr Latham says more than 200,000 blood donors and 12,500 platelet donors are needed this Christmas to safeguard hundreds of thousands of patients. ‘On top of those who need regular transfusions, such as cancer patients, there’s extra strain because of all the people suffering accidents with the cold weather and alcohol-related injuries around this time of year,’ he says.

‘We ran a similar campaign in 2013 and got through it by actively emailing and calling regular donors, but with the longer break this Christmas, the pressure is really on.’

He adds: ‘We’ve recently been running a Know Your Type promotion in shopping centres and universities to test new people who haven’t donated before. We’re always looking for new donors, particularly from the Asian, Caribbean, black African, Bangladeshi and Indian communities, which commonly have rare blood groups and are prone to blood disorders such as sickle cell anaemia.’

Lulah, of Higham Ferrers, Northamptonshire, is A RhD Positive, a fairly common type, but for her first five transfusions she needed O RhD Negative as she was too young to ascertain which blood type she was.

Tariq recalls: ‘My father, my elder daughter Tamzyn, 15, and I have the same condition, but in a milder form. I had my spleen removed when I was five, which was very young, but we’ve been told Lulah needs to have hers removed early next year. It’s a very risky operation for someone so young, but it’s the only long-term option we have.’

As well as transfusions, Lulah is regularly admitted to Kettering General Hospital with complications related to her condition.

‘It’s increasingly hard to get a needle into her veins because of all the scar tissue,’ her father says. ‘It is very distressing but Lulah takes it all in her stride.

‘We want to thank everyone who has ever given blood – and to anyone thinking about it, I urge you to do it. We don’t mind that Lulah’s got to be in hospital on Christmas Day. Without the transfusions, our little girl wouldn’t be with us to enjoy Christmas at all.’
