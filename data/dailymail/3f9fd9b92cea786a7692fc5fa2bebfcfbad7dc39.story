Salman Butt and Mohammad Asif have been convicted of match-fixing in the scandal that rocked cricket.

They both now face up to seven years in prison when they are sentenced on Thursday after being found guilty of conspiracy to cheat and accept corrupt payments.

After deliberating for nearly 17 hours, the jury convicted the pair at London's Southwark Crown Court.

And it can now be revealed that Mohammad Aamer has already pleaded guilty to both charges. This detail was not previously reported because of court restrictions.

Good riddance: Butt waves before discovering his verdict

Sally Walsh, senior lawyer in the Crown Prosecution Service's special crime and counter-terrorism division, said: 'Salman Butt, Mohammad Aamer and Mohammad Asif deliberately and knowingly perverted the course of a cricket match for financial gain.

'Through their actions they brought shame on the cricketing world, jeopardising the faith and admiration of cricket fans the world over.

'This prosecution shows that match fixing is not just unsportsmanlike but is a serious criminal act.

'The actions of these top international players went against everything expected of someone in their position and they failed to take into account their fans of all ages and nationalities when deciding to abandon the values of sportsmanship so unconditionally.

'The prosecution said that Butt, Aamer, and Asif conspired together, in August 2010, to accept money as an inducement or reward for the giving of advance information about the bowling of no-balls in the Lord's Test match by Asif and Aamer.

'The court was told that these charges related to the bowling of no-balls on August 26 and 27 2010, during Pakistan's fourth Test at Lord's Cricket Ground in London.

'People who had paid good money to see a professional and exciting game of cricket on the famous ground at Lord's had no idea that what they were watching was not a true game but one where part of the game had been pre-determined for cash.

'Butt and Asif denied any wrongdoing but the jury has decided after hearing all the evidence that what happened on the crease that day was criminal in the true sense of the word.'

The pair did not react to the first verdicts, sitting expressionless in the dock.

Asif returned to the court in the afternoon to be found guilty of the charge of accepting corrupt payments.

Butt was found guilty as his wife Gul Hassan gave birth to their second son after undergoing a Caesarean section in hospital in Pakistan.

Former Test captain Butt, 27, and 
fast bowler Asif, 28, plotted to bowl deliberate no-balls in last 
summer's Lord's Test against England.

The pair were caught after an undercover reporter recorded UK-based sports agent Mazhar Majeed, 36, boasting how he could arrange for Pakistan cricketers to rig games for money.

Majeed claimed he had been carrying out match-fixing for two-and-a-half years and had made 'masses and masses of money'.

He
 spoke of the advantages of 'grooming' younger cricketers to work with 
him and bragged that he had seven players in Pakistan's national side 
rigging games for him.

The 
corrupt agent also discussed deliberately losing the Oval Test match 
against England last summer for more than a million dollars and plotted 
to fix games at last year's Twenty20 World Cup in the West Indies.

The
 fixing scandal emerged after the News of the World's investigations 
editor Mazher Mahmood approached Majeed in August last year pretending 
to be a wealthy Indian businessman seeking major international 
cricketers for a tournament. The agent was secretly filmed accepting Â£150,000 in cash from the journalist as part of an arrangement to rig games.

Majeed
 promised the reporter that Asif and fellow fast bowler Aamer, 19, would
 deliver three no-balls at specific points during the Lord's Test 
between Pakistan and England from August 26 to 29 last year.

The no-balls were bowled exactly as 
promised. The probability of someone predicting this by chance was 
estimated by a cricket statistician as 1.5 million to one.

Butt and Asif both strenuously denied any involvement in match-fixing.Explaining
 why he bowled a no-ball at Lord's precisely when Majeed said he would, 
Asif claimed that Butt told him "run faster, f***er" moments before his 
delivery.

The former 
Pakistan captain said the agent asked him to rig parts of crunch games 
at the 2010 Twenty20 World Cup and last summer's Test series against 
England.

He insisted he
 ignored the requests, but admitted he did not fulfil his duty to inform
 the cricketing authorities about the corrupt approach.

Blatant: Mohammad Aamer bowled obvious no balls at Lord's

The jury was not told that Aamer pleaded
 guilty to conspiracy to cheat and conspiracy to accept corrupt payments
 at a pre-trial hearing on September 16.

Aamer, a teenage cricketing sensation who was tipped to become one of the all-time great fast bowlers, issued a heartfelt apology for his actions through his lawyer when he pleaded guilty.

His barrister, Ben Emmerson QC, told the court: 'Aamer wants to make it clear he wants to take full responsibility for what he did by deliberately bowling two no-balls.

'This vulnerable 18-year-old boy, as he 
was then, was subjected to extreme pressure from those upon whom he 
should have been able to rely.

'He recognises the damage he has caused Pakistan cricket and he wishes to do his best to put that right.'

The jury was also not told that the International Cricket Council imposed long suspensions on the three Pakistan cricketers in February.

Butt was banned for 10 years, five of them suspended, Asif for seven years, two of them suspended, and Aamer was banned for five years. They are all appealing against the bans.

The officer in charge of the case, Detective Chief Superintendent Matthew Horne, of the Metropolitan Police, paid tribute to the News of the World for the investigation which sparked the charges.

He said: 'You have to give credit to the investigative journalism. I recognised there was a case to build on top of it. It's fair to say we wouldn't be here without their investigative journalism that started it.'

Sting: News of the World cover

Reacting to the outcome of the trial, sports minister Hugh Robertson said: 'This is a sad day for international cricket and sport in general. The integrity of sport is absolutely paramount. Fans have to be sure that what they see in front of them is true and fair.

'There needs to be a global effort on sports betting integrity and this is something that the International Olympic Committee president Jacques Rogge has taken a lead on, heading up a high-level working group that I sit on.

'International sports bodies and governments need to work together and do everything possible to stamp out the threat of corruption in sport.'

Yawar Saeed was Pakistan's team manager last summer, when the corruption was first alleged. The 76-year-old said the players had failed to heed his warnings about outside influences.

Saeed told Cricinfo: 'It is a very 
disappointing and sad day for us in one way, for the players and for 
Pakistan cricket to be caught up in criminal proceedings.

'But
 they did something wrong and they had to pay the price for it. As 
manager, I had spoken to all the players on that tour and had talked 
about focusing on cricket and keeping their eye on the ball, but in the 
case of some, they didn't.

'I
 think the impact of the entire incident has already been felt months 
ago, when the case first came up, when the players were banned by the 
ICC. What is required now is to forget everything and move ahead.

'These
 things have happened in the past and the game has moved on. India had 
its own case and banned its players. The biggest jolt has already 
happened for Pakistan cricket and it could not get worse.

'But
 we have recovered from this and the team is doing well, I don't think 
the verdict will hurt the team now, there is no shortage of talent in 
Pakistan.'

Saeed stressed the players who have come into the Pakistan team have ensured the convicted trio are not being missed.

He
 said: 'We had good players who could replace the players involved in 
this case and they have done so. We just want the team to keep doing 
well now.'
