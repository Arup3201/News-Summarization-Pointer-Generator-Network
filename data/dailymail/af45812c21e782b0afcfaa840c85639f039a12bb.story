Sebastian Vettel thought about quitting Formula One last year, according to his then Red Bull team principal Christian Horner.

The 2014 season was Vettel’s annus horribilis – he failed to win a race and was outscored and outshone by his new team-mate Daniel Ricciardo, who won three races.

And on Tuesday Horner  spelt out the extent of Vettel’s dejection, saying: ‘Sebastian didn’t like the regulation change. He didn’t enjoy the new engine, the feel from the power unit or the lack of downforce.

‘It was like someone had taken his toy away and it took him a while to get to grips with that. Then his team-mate delivered, and that wasn’t something he was used to.

‘He went through a period of disillusion about the direction Formula One was going and he was outspoken about that.

'There was probably a stage last year when he thought about whether he wanted to stop or not, whether he was getting the same level of enjoyment and whether he wanted to continue.’

Vettel, 27, decided to join Ferrari, leaving Red Bull to pair Ricciardo with Toro Rosso’s 20-year-old Russian Daniil Kvyat. They will both take to the track next week in Jerez for the first pre-season test.

‘Sebastian’s boyhood hero was Michael (Schumacher) and the lure of Ferrari for any driver – the brand and the mystique – is immensely powerful,’ added Horner, whose once rock-solid relationship with Vettel weakened last season.

‘He is still a young guy and a tremendous amount has gone on his life in a short period of time. It was question of giving him the space to come to his own conclusions.' 

Vettel was used to winning (pictured in October 2013) and it was as if he 'lost his toy' last season, said Horner
