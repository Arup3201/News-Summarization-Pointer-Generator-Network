Jordan Henderson has hailed Brendan Rodgers as ‘one of the top managers in the world’ and backed Liverpool to qualify for the Champions League again after the Anfield revival continued with the club’s biggest win of the season over Swansea on Monday night.

After struggling for much of the first half of the campaign, Liverpool revived memories of last season’s barnstorming performances as they won 4-1 to make it seven points from three games over Christmas.

Only two weeks ago, Rodgers took his team to Bournemouth in the Capital One Cup with a question mark hanging over his future at Anfield. But Henderson, who captained Liverpool against Swansea in the absence of Steven Gerrard, believes they have got the best possible man for the job.

‘The manager has been fantastic ever since he came to the club,’ said the England midfielder. ‘He’s working really hard for us on the training field to ensure that tactically we are better and improving all the time.

‘It’s up to us as players to ensure we put that into practice on the pitch and we definitely did that against Swansea. We got our just rewards for that.

‘It’s been hard on everyone. We’ve gone from winning every week to not winning as often. But the manager has always been the same. He has always looked to improve things on the training field.

‘For me, he’s one of the top managers in the world. We just have to make sure we keep on putting in the hard work and listening to what he has to say. If we do that then we’ll keep going in the right direction.

‘He has proved he’s a top-class manager and everyone buys into it because we know he’s so good tactically.

‘He’s outstanding at seeing what’s happening in games and changing it whenever he needs to. You can see that. If it’s not going right in the first 10 to 15 minutes he will change something.’

Rodgers switched Emre Can to centre-back against Swansea and played Adam Lallana and Philippe Coutinho alongside Raheem Sterling in a three-man attack.

A high-intensity performance brought a deserved victory that lifted Liverpool up to eighth place in the table at the halfway stage of the season, five points off the top-four.

Asked if they can rejoin Europe’s elite in the Champions League next season, Henderson said: ‘Of course we can. We’ve got quality players here. You saw against Swansea that when we play well we look a top, top side. We just need to be more consistent and make sure we do that every game.

‘We were on the front foot, closing down really well and we were a real threat going forward. Everyone has to be on board when you press high up the pitch like that. 

'I felt as though everyone was, especially from the front with Raheem, Philippe and Adam.

‘They worked really hard on the press and then it was easy for us squeezing up behind. We did that really well and we need to keep on doing it.

‘We want to ensure the second half of the season is much better than the first half. We have to keep playing like that. If we do, then the results will follow.

‘I don’t mind all the games coming together in a short period like this. You want to be playing in big games. When they come thick and fast it's a good chance to get points on the board, especially when you need to climb the league.’
