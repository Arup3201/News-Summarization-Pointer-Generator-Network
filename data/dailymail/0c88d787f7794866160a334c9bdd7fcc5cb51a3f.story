A plague of mutant ginger rats first spotted in Scotland are feared to have made their way south of the border, it was revealed last night.

A shocking video taken by two revellers in Newcastle-upon-Tyne shows 60 large rodents scurrying down the street in a popular area of the city on Saturday.

Now, there are claims the rats could be the same giant ginger species recently spotted 60 miles away in Hawick in the Scottish borders - which were feared to be moving south.

Marc Donaghey, 22, and his girlfriend Brooke Salkeld, 21, captured the footage of around 20 rats - but said in total there were at least 50 or 60 of them running around the street.

Mr Donaghey said: ‘We walked around the corner and we saw dozens of rats. You only see a few on the video but when we first went around the corner there were about 50 or 60.

‘They were all over the bins and then running down the road. There were a few other people walking past so I’d shout “watch!” and then they saw them. They were disgusted.’

The video shows rats scuttling over the cobbles of a back lane and onto a nearby stretch of grass, squeaking loudly. The rodents are feared to be the same as the beasts spotted in Hawick last week.

Numerous sightings were being reported to the council on a daily basis - and the rodents are believed to have ginger fur because freed domestic rats have been breeding with wild Scottish rats.

Newcastle City Council’s environment manager Edwin Foster said: ‘Littering and poor refuse storage attract vermin. Traders have a legal responsibility to make sure they store and dispose of their refuse correctly.’

‘Pest control officers have been treating this area and will continue to do so, but people must understand the rats are there because people are leaving rubbish for the rats to feed on. ‘

In Hawick, one businessman said he had seen ‘dozens’ of rats at a time on an industrial estate, while a pest controller in Scotland confirmed that he had been killing rodents on the site for months.

But he added that it was becoming increasingly difficult to exterminate the creatures due to fear of killing other animals. A Scottish Borders Council spokesman said it was monitoring the rats there.

Last year, a 2ft-long rat was captured in Cornwall

A new breed of genetically-mutated ‘super rats’ is spreading at alarming speeds, experts say.

The rodents, which have been seen elsewhere in Britain over the past year, are twice as large as normal species and cannot be killed with traditional substances.

Earlier this year a swarm of mutant 20-inch rats that are immune to poison were found in Swindon, Wiltshire.

Scientists have been charting the super rat invasion into new communities by monitoring their progress in 17 counties in the UK.

Genetic testing by Huddersfield University has revealed that the rodents have developed a mutation that allows them to survive conventional poisons. 

Research earlier this year found that the swarm of ‘super rats’ spotted across the country is expected to outnumber humans two-to-one by next year.

Last year, a 2ft-long rat was captured in Cornwall, with other huge rodents seen in Kent and Liverpool. Birmingham reported the most rat-related call-outs, with 5,100 in the past year.
