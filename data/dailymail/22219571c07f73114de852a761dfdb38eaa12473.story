The bloody fight  in the Glodwick area of Oldham, Greater Manchester, was filmed by an onlooker on a phone - police have confirmed that three men have now been arrested on suspicion of assault and have been bailed

The disturbing video shows what appears to be an organised bare-knuckle fight between two men with a graphic commentary by the person filming the incident.

Swearing and racist language is used throughout the video and despite one of the men asking for the fight to stop because he is passing out, another person can be heard encouraging the man to 'kill' him.

One of the men can be seen repeatedly punching the other in the face as he bleeds heavily from his head.

In the background of the shocking video a man can be heard shouting 'kill, kill, kill - if it comes to it, kill him.' and 'eat him alive' as the two men grappled with each other.

One of the men was left bloodied following the brutal fight - he also punches the camera away from his face

The person filming is heard saying: 'Bite into him, kick him in the b***s', 'his eye is busted, brilliant' and 'knock him out, kill him.'

At one point he adds: 'Stop biting him or I'm going to kick you in the face.'

When another onlooker interjects: 'Not to sleep, no man, that's it, he's out, he's out innit, stop, leave it' another man is heard shouting 'Strangle him - you know what it is? He's got too much attitude in him.'

The footage goes on to show the bloodied combatant punching the person filming before sitting in a silver car outside Pure Gym, near Alexandra Park, where he is seen shaking hands with another man.

The video remains online with over 9,000 views since it was posted in October.

People who watched the video on YouTube posted messages on the video sharing site.

One viewer said: 'Parents must be so proud of them...tut tut!! Filming it as well!!...takes bigger men to laugh and walk away!'

Another read: 'It was a one on one fight and he took it like a man. At the end both guys shook on it and called it quits, at least they sorted it out like proper gentlemen. Fair play to both of them.'
