The body of Casey Kasem, who died on June 15, has still not been buried, his daughter revealed this week.

Kerri Kasem told The View on Thursday that the bitter feud between her father's second wife Jean and his three children from his first marriage had deepened.

She said that her father's remains were still in Washington despite the fact that his wish was to be buried in Glendale, California.

Kerri Kasem told The View on Thursday that her father Casey Kasem had not been buried following his June 15 death due to an ongoing feud between his children and second wife

Miss Kasem said: 'I don't know what's going on with [Jean] and why she makes the decisions she does.'

Widow Jean Kasem has accused the DJ's children of making a desperate grab for his life insurance following his death.

Mrs Kasem 
accused his daughter Kerri of calling his funeral home to ask how 
quickly a death certificate could be issued so his sizeable policy could
 be cashed out.

However,
 Kerri has hit back, saying that Jean hasn't had Casey body flown out to
 L.A. for burial yet because she is trying to deflect attention from an 
imminent investigation into elderly abuse.

Kerri Kasem also told The View that she could not remember why the feud had started.

She said: 'If I knew I would tell you. I would try and make amends. I would say, ''I'm sorry Jean. What happened? ... Why do you hate us so much?'''

Mr Kasem died on June 15 - Father's Day -  aged 82 from Parkinson's disease, dementia and sepsis.

Kerri Kasem claimed Jean took him out of his rest home and moved him 
around the U.S. at the end of his life to keep him away from family.

During the trip he developed a bedsore which contributed to his death, his children have claimed.

Jean is now arguing that the whole saga is a ploy by his children to get their hands on his money.

According to TMZ,
 Jean said: 'Their impatience for Casey to die was obvious... and now 
their impatience to collect on the life insurance is even more telling.'

The DJ's eldest children held a memorial service for him last weekend, attended by 200 people including his brother, but excluding Jean and her daughter Liberty, who she had with Casey.

Jean has put Casey's Beverly Hills mansion, complete with eight bedrooms, 14 bathrooms, tennis courts, and a piece of the Brooklyn bridge, on the market for $42million.

According to reports, 
Jean will be handling funeral arrangements for the late DJ after his 
daughter Kerri agreed to her request to hand over his remains.

Kerri
 Kasem had been granted custody last month over her father’s medical 
care, but that role expired when her father died on Father's Day morning.

An attorney for Kerri told TMZ that Jean's attorney had reached out to request the body be released to her. The pair didn’t speak directly.

According to a recent filing of Casey's health directive he wanted a burial. Jean Casem will act as the executor of Casey's will. 

His death was announced on social media by his children, Mike, Kerri and Julie Kasem. The message didn't include the name of
 his second wife, Jean Kasem, who had been fighting them in in an ugly 
court battle over his medical treatment.

'Early this Father’s Day morning, our dad Casey Kasem passed away surrounded by family and friends,' the message read. 'Even though we know he is in a better place and no longer suffering, we are heartbroken.

'Thank you for all your love, support and prayers. The world will miss Casey Kasem, an incredible talent and humanitarian; we will miss our Dad. With love, Kerri, Mike and Julie.'

Kasem died in a Washington hospital at 3.23am, spokesman Danny Deraney said in a statement.

In 2013, Kasem's children filed a legal petition to gain control of his health care, alleging that Kasem was suffering from advanced Parkinson's disease and that his wife was isolating him from friends and family members. Kasem also suffered from Lewy Body Disease, a form of dementia.

Kasey Kasem's widow put his Beverly Hills mansion up for sale for $12million. The 12,000 square foot mansion also has eight bedrooms, 14 bathrooms, and a piece of the Brooklyn bridge

A judge in May temporarily stripped his wife of her caretaker role after she moved him from a medical facility in Los Angeles to a friend's home in Washington state.

Jean Kasem said she moved her husband to protect his privacy and to consult with doctors. Casey Kasem developed a severe bedsore while in Washington and was in critical condition by the time he was hospitalized in early June.

Kasem's transportation to Washington posed serious risks.

'She disconnected his G-tube, which provided his only source to nutrition and hydration,' Dr. Paul Leitner said in documents obtained by the paper. 'She was informed of the risks of doing so and was told she was placing Mr. Kasem in great bodily harm or possible demise.'

Jean Kasem had objected to a Wednesday ruling in a Los Angeles Superior Court that stopped her husband from being given food and drink over concerns it might be painful for him. 

'Right now, Casey Kasem's health is declining and (he) won't be with us much longer,' Danny Deraney said in a June 6 statement.

During 
temporary conservator Kerri Kasem's visit to see her father on June 1 in
 Washington state, Jean Kasem threw meat at her as he was preparing for a
 trip to the hospital.

'In
 the name of King David, I threw a piece of raw meat into the street in 
exchange for my husband to the wild rabid dogs,' she told NBC News.

Kasem became famous as the voice of American Top 40, and his career there began on July 4, 1970, in Los Angeles, when the No. 1 song was Three Dog Night's cover of Randy Newman's Mama Told Me Not to Come.

The show expanded to hundreds of stations, including Armed Forces Radio, and continued in varying forms - and for varying syndicators - into the 21st century.

He stepped down from American Top 40 in 2004 and retired altogether in 2009, completing his musical journey with Shinedown's 'Second Chance.'

While many DJs convulsed their listeners with stunts and 'morning zoo' snarkiness, Kasem would read 'long distance dedications' of songs sent in by readers and introduce countdown records with sympathetic background anecdotes about the singers.

'The idea 
from the beginning was to do the type of thing on radio that Ed Sullivan
 did on television, good, honest stories with human interest,' he told 
the Los Angeles Times in 1975.

Kasem's
 legacy reached well beyond music. His voice was heard in TV cartoons 
such as 'Scooby-Doo' as the voice of Shaggy and in numerous commercials.

'They
 are going to be playing Shaggy and Scooby-Doo for eons and eons,' Kasem
 told The New York Times in 2004.

'And they're going to forget Casey 
Kasem - unless they happen to step on his star on the Hollywood Walk of 
Fame. I'll be one of those guys people say "Who's that?" about. And 
someone else will say, "He's just some guy who used to be on the 
radio.'''

Succeeding Kasem at the main American Top 40 show in 2004 was multi-platform star Ryan Seacrest, who has said he had been a fan of Kasem since boyhood and would imitate him in pretend countdown broadcasts at age 9.
