Princess Anne has said that the focus of the opening celebrations of Olympic Games has moved away from the athletes and onto ‘excess’.

The royal member of the International Olympic Committee told fellow members that sportsmen and women who compete in the games athletes have become an ‘add on’ to a bigger celebration.

Speaking in Sochi today, Princess Anne, a former Olympic athlete herself, appeared to be making a dig at the extravagant opening of London 2012, in which her own mother, the Queen, took part.

Critical: Princess Anne has lamented to her fellow IOC members that athletes are no longer at the centre of Olympic opening ceremonies

‘I am old enough that I remember when 
the opening ceremony was only with the athletes,’ Princess Anne, who 
competed in equestrian at the 1976 Montreal Olympics said.

‘To me, the balance has gone too far the other way.’

The
 80-minute London 2012 show created by film director Danny Boyle was 
hugely popular in Britain. It included a rare and unexpected acting role
 by Queen Elizabeth II alongside James Bond actor Daniel Craig.

Their
 filmed scene concluded with a parachute jump from a helicopter by 
stuntmen dressed as the pair, who landed in the Olympic Stadium.

Princess Anne said opening ceremonies were important to remind that athletes ‘are committing themselves to the Olympic ideal.’

Her comments came during wide-ranging debates among 100-plus IOC members about future organization and running of the Olympics.

‘I
 think you can inform the royal family there will be no more 
parachuting,’ IOC President Thomas Bach quipped in response to the 
princess.

A previous 
speaker, Alex Gilady of Israel, said changing the procedure of the 
opening ceremony would be ‘a strong step in the wrong direction.’

‘The opening ceremony is for the world to be introduced to the athletes,’ Gilady said.

Another
 British IOC member, elected by athletes, said the opening ceremony was a
 ‘wonderful show,’ though many did not experience it fully while waiting
 to begin their parade into the main arena.

‘I
 think it is something athletes should have a chance to see properly,’ 
said Adam Pengilly, a former skeleton racer who competed at the past two
 Winter Games.
