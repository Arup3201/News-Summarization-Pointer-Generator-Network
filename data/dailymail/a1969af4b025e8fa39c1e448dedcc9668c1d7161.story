These glorious photographs show how tens of thousands of Muslims yesterday climbed a mountain to celebrate a key date in their religious calendar at the biggest Islamic gathering site  in Europe.

They were pictured riding horses, watching on or praying as they marked the anniversary of Ajvatovica near the village of Prusac in central Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Large groups of people climb the mountain every year to pray at a site where, according to tradition, a miracle happened when a huge rock divided in half after a Muslim man prayed in front of it.

The pilgrimage is a 503-year-old tradition and happens each year at Prusac, an uncommercialised village with traditional architecture around 80 miles north-west of the country’s capital, Sarajevo.

‘It's a tiny place where people live the way they always have - and in June they wait for the thousands of visitors with open arms,’ an article about Prusac on the country’s official tourism website says.

The story of the rock dividing dates back to the legend of Dedo Ajvaz, an old grandfather who prayed for water during a long period of drought that threatened the small mountain community.

He was said to have prayed for 40 days until a large rock face began to tremble and it soon split, from which water started to flow. The site was soon visited by many Muslims and Christians.
