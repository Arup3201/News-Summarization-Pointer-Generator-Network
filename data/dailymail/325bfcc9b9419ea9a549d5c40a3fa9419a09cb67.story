A top American dog handler has caused outrage by picking up her championship winning Scottish Terrier by its tail at a British show.

Rebecca Cross, who won Best in Show at Crufts last weekend, was filmed picking up her Scottish terrier Knopa by its neck and tail - an act she says was 'just habit'.

Now Cross, a mother-of-one and military veteran from Glen Burnie, Maryland, is at the center of a campaign calling for her to be stripped of the prestigious accolade.

More than 100,000 people have signed a petition following the competition, which has already seen more than its fair share of scandal.

Animal lovers have accused the Crufts organisers of 'turning a blind eye' after footage emerged showing U.S competitor Rebecca Cross picking up her Scottish terrier Knopa by its neck and tail

Nearly 100,000 people have now signed an online petition, calling for Ms Cross to be stripped of her prestigious title

 The Kennel Club explained that it had warned Ms Cross not to pick up the dog in that manner but that it was 'customary' to do so in the U.S

'Strip Rebecca Cross of her Best In Show award at Crufts 2015 for her unduly harsh handling of the Scottish Terrier, Knopa,' the petition reads.

'Under KC Rule A42 I believe that Ms Cross is guilty of "behaving discreditably and prejudicially to the interests of the canine world" and should be held accountable.' 

The British Kennel Club, the organizers of the show, which was held in Birmingham, said it had warned Cross not to pick up the dog in that manner but that it was 'customary' to do so in the U.S.

Knopa beat over 21,000 dogs to be named Best in Show at the competition.  

After the footage emerged of Cross handling her dog, Crufts issued an almost immediate apology.

Cross also issued an apology, saying she 'didn't do it on purpose, it was just habit'.

She added: 'It's just one of those things. It happened and I tried to really think about it and not do it, but it's habit.'

Cross, who lived in Japan for four years and now resides in Maryland where she breeds different types of pedigree dogs, has bred and owned Scottish Terriers for two decades.

She has previously won multiple Best in Shows, according to an online bio, and also works full-time for a consulting group in Maryland, according to her website.

Despite her apology, the anger towards her continued to grow, with the petition gaining nearly 100,000 in less than 12 hours. 

It claims  Ms Cross is guilty of ‘behaving discreditably and prejudicially to the interests of the canine world’.

But, in a second statement, the Kennel Club said it would not be 'fair' to strip the dog of its Best in Show title, solely due to the  behavior of its owner.

A Kennel Club spokesman added that, although there was 'clear guidance' that dogs should not be handled in this way, it would be reviewing its procedures in light of the incident. 

Jagger, who is co-owned by Belgian Aleksandra Lauwers and Leicester-based breeder Dee Milligan-Bott, died in his owner's arms on Friday, after returning home to Belgium 

Scandal: The owner of this chamption Myter, Eye to Eye, also believes the dog was deliberately poisoned after she was found vomiting and shaking in pain shortly before it was due to be judged on Friday

The Scottish Terrier was initially bred as a working dog by farmers to eradicate vermin and hunt small animals underground.

It has a very long and strong tail which owners traditionally used to pull it out of holes.

It is not said to hurt to pick them up in this way.

They were introduced into America in the early 1890s and it was not until the years between World War I and World War II that they became popular.

They have been owned by a variety of celebrities, including the 32nd President of the United States, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, whose Scottie "Fala" is included with FDR in a statue in Washington, DC, as well as the 43rd President George W. Bush.  

They said: 'We completely understand the concerns about how Knopa, the Best in Show dog, was handled on the judging table. 

'A decision will be made by committee about what action may be taken within the current rules and guidance. 

In this specific case an investigation is underway and a decision will be made by committee about the actions that have been taken by the exhibitor at Crufts and the next steps. 

'The judge’s primary focus is on the dogs themselves and we do not believe it would be fair to strip the dog of its Best in Show title because the dog was awarded this prize based on its own merits in the show ring.' 

It added: 'Prior to this incident the guidance related to handling has been followed by those showing their dogs but in light of this situation we will be reviewing our rules and guidance and how they may need to be amended going forward.

This is the latest incident are the latest controversies to hit the world famous competition. 

Earlier this week, it emerged that six dogs who took part in the competition had been reportedly poisoned, including Irish setter Jagger, who died at his Belgium home on Monday.

The RSPCA confirmed it was investigating allegations that an overseas competitor had mistreated his dog outside the showground, pictured
