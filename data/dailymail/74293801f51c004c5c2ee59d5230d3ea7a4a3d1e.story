From outside, the hotel displayed a sign  apologising and informing patrons that the venue was closed due to Monday's public holiday.

But inside, the team members of the South Sydney Rabbitohs celebrated their historic NRL premiership win from the previous night against the Canterbury Bulldogs - their first in 43 years. 

The only hint of the celebration inside the Dolphin Hotel in Sydney's Surry Hills, was a bright red and green South Sydney Rabbitohs' flag, hung up from the venues balcony. 

The NRL team's captain, John Sutton, was seen sitting back on the balcony of the hotel in Sydney's south east alongside Greg Inglis, whose long-range try nicknamed the 'goanna crawl' had spectators cheering on Sunday night.

With a cigarette hanging limply from his lips and his backwards hat revealing his face, Inglis appeared well content after a long day celebrating South Sydney's NRL premiership win.

Tom Burgess also made a brief appearance on the balcony as the hotel staff battled against the wind to tape tablecloths to the glass in an attempt to provide the team with some privacy.

His twin brother George was also seen, with a well-deserved drink in hand, peering from inside the hotel. 

Each of the team members were dressed casually and appeared to be enjoying their private party while a range of hip-hop and rap songs blared from the speakers inside.

Earlier in the day, the team received a heroic welcome as they mingled with thousands of Rabbitoh's fans who crammed into and around Redfern Oval on Monday afternoon to celebrate the club's long-awaited grand final win.

Sam Burgess also made an appearance despite playing the majority of Sunday's grand final with a broken cheek after injuring himself in the first tackle. 

The 25-year-old has put off surgery on his fractured cheekbone until Tuesday in order to continue celebrating the historical win alongside his team mates, with CEO Shane Richardson calling him 'the bravest man I've ever seen' during an interview with Channel 10's The Project on Monday night.

His black eye and cheek were clearly visible on Monday as he thanked fans for their support at Redfern Oval.

Burgess, who played his final game for the Rabbitohs before he heads back to the UK to play rugby union for Bath, will  undergo surgery on Tuesday after doctors initially expected to operate soon after the game.

For Souths legend George Piggins, the man who successfully fought to have the club reinstated after its expulsion from the competition in 2000, Sunday's game was the first he had attended since Russell Crowe and Peter Holmes à Court took over in 2006.

While impressed with Burgess's courage, Piggins pointed to John Sattler who played almost the entire 1970 grand final  with a broken jaw.

'I've never had a broken cheek bone,' Piggins told Daily Mail Australia. 'I've had a broken jaw. And I've got to say I've never had anything more painful in my life.

'With a broken jaw, when you come out of it all your teeth are wired up. It smells like a sewer rat. No risk in the wide world (a broken cheek bone) hurts. But I'll go for the cheek bone.'

The crowd of supporters cheered at the entrance of the Burgess twins, Tom and George

Piggins, who attended the grand final only because businessman John Singleton, the TAB and car deal Steven Nasteski donated a total of $120,000 to charity, said he would be happy to attend another game sometime.

'I might find myself doing that,' the 69-year-old said. 'If I can go to the football and I can sit where I want to sit and be with who I want to be with.

'I'd be interested to go back to another game but there wouldn't be all the fanfare. There's other things in life.'
