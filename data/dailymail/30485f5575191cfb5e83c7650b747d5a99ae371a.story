It's how billions of people get to and from work every day around the world.

And these incredible images show just how crowded that journey can be for commuters in countries around the globe.

From an overcrowded train in South Africa, to 15 million scooters in a jam in Taiwan, photographers have captured commuters travelling in cities around the globe.
