A senior member of the al Qaeda-aligned al Shabaab militant group has been killed by a U.S. air strike in Somalia, the Pentagon has confirmed.

The Pentagon announced today that a U.S. airstrike on Monday killed the intelligence chief of the al-Shabab extremist group in Somalia, Tahlil Abdishakur.

Abdishakur was the head of Amniyat, a unit believed responsible for suicide attacks in Mogadishu, Somalia's National Intelligence and Security Agency said in a statement.

The Pentagon said U.S. drone aircraft fired several Hellfire missiles to hit a vehicle carrying the al-Shabab intelligence chief.

The U.S. military launched an air strike in Somalia on Monday targeting a senior leader of the al Qaeda-aligned al Shabaab militant group, but are yet to comment on whether their mission was a success

The Somali government announced the death on Tuesday but the Pentagon did not immediately confirm.

The Pentagon has now said his death will ‘significantly impact’ the group's ability to conduct attacks against the Somali government and its people, as well as U.S. allies in the region.

Al-Shabab is an ultra-conservative Islamic militant group that is linked to the al-Qaeda terrorist network and wants to run Somalia by its strict interpretation of Shariah law.

In a statement released by the Somali government, a spokesman said: 'In a joint operation last night by the Somali national security and the United States, al-Shabaab intelligence chief Abdishakur, also known as Tahlil, who replaced the recently arrested former chief, was eliminated,'  adding that the strike took place near the town of Saacow, some 200 miles west of the capital Mogadishu.

A U.S. official told Reuters on Tuesday that Abdishakur was killed in the attack along with another Shabaab militant who was not identified.

The air strike came two days after top al-Shabaab militant, Zakariya Ahmed Ismail Hersi turned himself in; above, an armed member of the militant group al-Shabab attends a rally in support of the merger of the Somali militant group al-Shabab with al-Qaida, on the outskirts of Mogadishu, in September

The strike was the latest in a recent campaign against al Shabaab. 

In September, a U.S. drone strike killed the group's main leader, Ahmed Abdi Godane.

Mark Wright, U.S. defense department spokesman, said earlier the air strike took place near Saakow, but the success of the operation was not yet known.

He said:  'We are assessing the results of the operation and will provide additional information, when appropriate, as details become available.'  

Wright said there  no civilians or bystanders had been injured 

Despite militants suffering huge losses in recent years, including the killing of their leader in a US air strike earlier this year, al-Shabaab remains a threat.

The U.S. has supported the African Union force that has driven al-Shabab out of the capital Mogadishu and other towns since 2011.

Al-Shabaab leader Ahmed Abdi Godane was killed by a U.S. air strike in September.

The air strike came two days after top al-Shabaab militant, Zakariya Ahmed Ismail Hersi, reportedly gave himself up.

He was part of a $3 million U.S. State Department 'Rewards for Justice' programme.

Reports have said Hersi turned himself in to Somali government and African Union troops on Saturday.
