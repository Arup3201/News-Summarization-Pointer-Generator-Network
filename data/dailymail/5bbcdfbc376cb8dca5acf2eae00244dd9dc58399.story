Traumatised children and parents have described the horrifying scene at the Connecticut elementary school where a gunman opened fire on Friday morning, killing 20 children and six adults.

Terror unfolded after a gunman, identified as 20-year-old Adam Lanza, opened fire in the principal's office before heading to the kindergarten classroom where his mother taught at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newton at 9.35am.

One man described how his younger sister first became aware of the shooting spree after she heard bullets and screams coming through the intercoms in the buildings.

Horror: Young children wait outside the school as police and paramedics swarm the area

'It really started when she heard 
gunshots and screams on the intercoms,' the unidentified relative told 
MSNBC. 'She heard screams. They were hiding in a tiny closet all bundled
 up. They were hearing screams and it was horrible.'

When police arrived to lead them from the building, 'they were told to hold hands and close their eyes', he said. 'What was in there must have been very gruesome.'

Children described hearing loud booms as
 the gunman let out as many as 100 rounds and as their teachers ushered 
them into corners away from his killing spree.

They were locked 
inside their classrooms until police came and evacuated them to a nearby
 fire station. Images showed the traumatised, crying students hand-in-hand as they left the buildings.

'It was horrendous,' said parent 
Brenda Lebinski, who rushed to the school where her daughter is in the

'Everyone was in hysterics - parents, students. There were 
kids coming out of the school bloodied. I don't know if they were shot, 
but they were bloodied.'

Fourth-grader Bear Nikitchyuk was going to his classroom when he heard someone kicking a door, USA Today reported.

'I looked behind me and all I saw was smoke and I smelled smoke,' he said. 'I heard shots fired. The second-grade teacher grabbed me and pulled me into her room.'

One child leaving said there was shattered glass everywhere throughout the school, while another girl told WVIT the moment she heard gunfire break out.

'I was in the gym and I heard like seven loud
 booms,' she said. 'And the gym teachers told us to go into the corner so we all 
huddled. I kept hearing these booming noises.

'We all started crying so all the gym teachers told us to go 
into the office where no one could find us. Then a police officer came in and told us to run outside.'

A
 boy told local stations: 'I was out in the hall when everybody heard 
the bullets. They went into a panic.' Of his own response to the 
gunfire, he could simply said: 'Woah.'

'I saw some of the bullets going down the hall and then a teacher pulled me into her classroom,' an eight-year-old student told CBS2.

Another
 student, a third-grader, told WTNH that she was sitting in her 
classroom when police flooded the area after numerous reports of a 
shooter.

'We saw police officers and we heard them on our roof and in our building,' the girl said.

Some of the children were crying, and others complained they had a stomach ache, she said.

Alexis Wasik, a third-grader at the 
school, said she heard shots and saw her former nursery school teacher 
being taken out of the building on a stretcher.

'We had to walk with a partner,' said eight-year-old Wasik.

One father, Richard Wilford, spoke of
 the horrifying moment he received a phone call telling him his son's 
elementary school was under attack.

He said: 'This is an elementary 
school. It's one of the better schools in the area. It was certainly a 
shock to hear this had happened.

'What human being walks into an elementary school and starts shooting? That's just not normal.

'My
 son said he heard loud noises. They were told to go into a corner of 
the room. That's when they were recovered by the police. My son is safe.
 He doesn’t want to talk.'

Of
 receiving the call, he added: 'What do you feel in your heart? I cannot
 try to explain it. There’s no words I can come up with that even come 
close to describing the sheer terror when your son is trapped in a 
situation of violence and there’s nothing you can do.'

Declan Procaccini, whose daughter is in the third grade, said she was in a reading class when she and a teacher 'heard bangs'.

Sadness: A woman weeps as she arrives to pick up her children at the Sandy Hook Elementary School

The teacher locked her with another teacher into a bathroom and waited until police arrived to escort them out.

'My kids are already asking, "When is this going to happen again?" he said. 'It was only a week ago that we were talking about this type of situation, and I said the chances of it happening are one in a zillion at Sandy Hook. I was wrong about that.'

There are preliminary reports that 
the gunman shot dead his father at their home before heading to the 
school, where his mother was a teacher. Her body was reportedly found at
 her home.

He then went
 from classroom to classroom firing at students and teachers with a 
.223-caliber rifle before turning the gun on himself.

His brother, Ryan Lanza, is also being questioned by police but is not a suspect.
