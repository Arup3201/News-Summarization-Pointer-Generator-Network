David Cameron is braced for heavy losses in today’s local elections as the Tories battle to prevent voters deserting them for the UK Independence Party.

The Prime Minister said backing the Conservatives was a ‘vote to keep your Council Tax bill down’ as polling stations opened in 34 councils in England and Wales.

But pollsters predict UKIP could win up to 100 seats, and cost the Tories hundreds more after a campaign dominated by the rise in Nigel Farage’s anti-EU party.

The parties go into battle in 34 councils in tomorrow's elections, with the Tories braced for big losses in areas last contested in 2009 when Gordon Brown was leading Labour to a major defeat. But all eyes will be on what impact UKIP can make, and how many votes it can take from the bigger parties

In a last ditch bid to woo voters, Mr 
Cameron yesterday revealed he could rush forward legislation on staging a
referendum on Britain’s membership of the European Union.

The Prime Minister suggested MPs could vote on Bill before the general election, despite opposition from the Lib Dems.

‘‘I think we need to demonstrate absolutely that we are serious about this referendum,’ he told the BBC.

The
surprise announcement, which even caught Conservative Cabinet ministers
off guard, was seen as an attempt to stop the Tories haemorrhaging 
votes to UKIP today.

But Mr Farage dismissed it as ‘another brittle pledge by Cameron which we won’t be falling for’.

He
added on Twitter: ‘Cameron EU poll pledge just isn't believable: 
clearly another desperate attempt to stop the rise of @UKIP.’

Mr Cameron also came under criticism from Tory MP Zac Goldsmith. He told the Evening Standard, Mr Goldsmith said: 'I don't think people on the streets are clear enough about what Cameron stands for - and that's a problem in politics.

'You need to have a clear sense of direction and that cannot involve a lot of U-turns or nudge-nudge, wink-wink, which is effectively what our airports policy is. Even critics respect leadership and decisiveness and I do think we are lacking in that up to a point.'

However, UKIP has been battered by a string of embarrassing revelations about its record slate of 1,700 candidates.

Mr Farage was forced to admit his party had not properly vetted everyone standing on a UKIP ticket after members were exposed for wearing a Jimmy Savile mask, blaming the Holocaust on Jews and branding Margaret Thatcher an 'old w****'.

He defended Somerset candidate Alex Wood over an image which apparently showed him giving a Nazi salute, insisting: ‘I believe him when he says that he was angrily trying to take a camera off his girlfriend who was annoyingly taking pictures of him in the pub imitating a pot plant,' he told Huffington Post.

Hampshire candidate Bradley Monk, 19, wore a mask of DJ paedophile Jimmy Savile to a Halloween party last year and Richard Delingpole, 46, a candidate in Somerset posted a photo mock-up on Facebook of himself stood next to Adolf Hitler. 

Today it emerged Christopher Thorpe, a UKIP candidate in Hertfordshire, was forced to resign as a police officer after he was caught working as a male escort in full uniform.

During the campaign Mr Farage was also forced to admit some of his policies need ‘more work’ amid claims it contains a £120billion blackhole in unfunded tax cuts and spending promises.

However, the dire publicity has done little to dent UKIP’s standing in opinion polls.

One ComRes survey poll in the 34 areas where council elections are being held suggested UKIP could secure 22 per cent of the vote, pushing the Lib Dems into a humiliating fourth place.

Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg last night admitted his party faces a poor result. ‘You know, we have been beaten by UKIP before in the polls,’ the Deputy Prime Minister told Channel 4 News last night.

‘What I am saying is that these things come and go in politics and I've seen them in my time come and go. UKIP beat us in 2009; a year later we won 24 per cent of the vote in the general election and UKIP were nowhere.’

Pressure is also mounting on Labour leader Ed Miliband, who has seen his lead in opinion polls narrow in recent weeks.

The Tories have challenged Labour to win an extra 1,000 seats, although pollsters predict gains of 370 are more likely.

Boris Johnson warned that the Tories 
could struggle in the local elections. The Mayor of London said: 'It's 
going to be a tough fight for my party in mid-term, that is inevitable.

'Obviously, for hard working 
Conservative councillors who do lose their seats, I'm sure they will be 
back. Mid-term blues are inevitable.'

Mr Miliband launched a back to basics campaign, touring the country and addressing crowds from a wooden pallet 'soap box' in high streets and town centres.

But he suffered a major setback when he repeatedly refused to admit during a BBC radio interview that his plan to cut VAT would increase borrowing.

He was asked 10 times on Monday about the impact of his policies on the nation's finances, but refused to answer. Confronted on Tuesday by claims his economic policies had descended into a 'Milishambles', he caved in and said: 'I am clear about this, a temporary cut in VAT, as we are proposing, would lead to a temporary rise in borrowing.'

On the campaign trail yesterday Mr Miliband said he was 'certain we can overcome our country's problems'. He added: 'The choice is between a One Nation Labour party that knows we rebuild Britain by standing up for the many and a Conservative-led government that only stands up for the few.'

Lord Tebbit courted controversy when he urged tactical voters to back the UK Independence Party in tomorrow’s local elections. In an extraordinary intervention, the Tory grandee said UKIP’s policies were now those ‘closest to a traditional Conservative agenda’.

And he urged Right-leaning voters in Labour areas to vote tactically for whichever candidate had the best chance of causing an upset – even if they are not Conservative.

‘If you have a Labour councillor then I suggest that the best vote is the one most likely to replace him or her with either a Conservative, UKIP or sound independent one,' he said.

UKIP has been under sustained assault from the Tories, with Kenneth Clarke branding the party a ‘collection of clowns’ supported by 'racists'.

And Tory sources believe the anti-EU party could do serious damage today with Conservatives potentially forced to go into coalition with UKIP councillors in once-safe Tory areas.

But Lord Tebbit said his party’s tactics were counterproductive and accused senior Tories, including Mr Clarke, of waging a ‘smear campaign’ against UKIP which could drive disaffected voters into the arms of the smaller party. Mr Cameron refused to be drawn into the row over UKIP being branded 'clowns' and 'racists'.

'I’m not calling anybody anything, what I’m doing is talking about what the Conservatives offer at the local elections and in the end it’s people who will go and vote and people who will choose,' he said yesterday.

He said he would not make predictions about the scale of Tory losses in tomorrow's elections. 'The Conservatives are defending more seats than anyone else, we control more councils than anyone else, so everyone’s having a shot at us.'
