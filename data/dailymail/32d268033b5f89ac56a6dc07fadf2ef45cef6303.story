Bravery: American John Riordon risked his life to save his Vietnamese co-workers

An American banker risked his life to save his Vietnamese colleagues just days before communist Vietcong guerrillas took control of Saigon.

John Riordon rescued over 100 of his colleagues as terrifying rumours spread of a civilian massacre, by pretending they were his wives and children on evacuation forms.

They now live prosperous lives as American citizens with children who are doctors and lawyers, and with grandchildren.

The tale of bravery began after Mr Riordon was posted as an assistant manager to Citibank in Saigon in 1975.

He developed a close relationship with his 34 co-workers and their families and hosted barbecues at his villa.

But
that April, just three weeks before Saigon fell - now known as Ho Chi 
Minh City - Mr Riordan was ordered by Citibank in New York to burn all 
the important files and leave immediately.

Reliving
the traumatic time, he told CBS News: 'They said, "John, we've 
chartered a 747 Pan Am that's coming in. And we want to take all of your
staff and leave the bank and get out to this plane.'"

Mr
Riordan realised that the bank's 34 Vietnamese employees, tellers, 
secretaries, accountants would be left in a dangerous situation once he 
left -  there were rumours of reprisals by the Viet Cong against anyone 
working for the Americans.

He attempted to draw up a plan with his Citibank bosses in Hong Kong to 
evacuate them including trying to send in helicopters and even an oil 
tanker.

But
after exhausting all possible options, including asking the U.S 
government for help, the team were told in no uncertain terms that if 
they tried to carry out a daring rescue mission they would be fired. 

But
then Mr Riordon's immediate boss, Mike McTighe, a former US marine told
told him that one of the pair needed to go back to help.

Determined: Faced with the prospect of losing his job or saving his friends, Mr Riordon caught the last commercial flight in Saigon in a desperate rescue mission

Faced with the prospect of losing 
his job or saving his friends, Mr Riordon caught the last commercial 
flight in Saigon in a desperate rescue mission.

He
then set about formulating a plan just 11 days before the fall, moving 
his former co-workers and their families - 105 in total - into his villa
and another one nearby.

Four
days later Mr Riordon was told by a CIA agent that now the only way to 
escape Vietnam was on a U.S. military cargo plane that was evacuating 
Americans and their dependents.

Mr
Riordon reminisced: 'He says, "The evacuation has been begun. Take your
family and go out to the airport and process them through."

'And
I said, 'Well, I don't have a family.'

And he said, "Just create a wife
and children, no matter who they are, and go out there and sign the 
documents." '

Determined
to try to save the group Mr Riordon took a bank van to an airfield and 
filled out a form certifying on a U.S. government document that he had a
Vietnamese wife and 14 children - even though on closer inspection some
of the children were actually older than him.

Fall: North Vietnamese soldiers running past destroyed aircraft on the tarmac of Saigon's Tan Son Nhat airport after Communist troops shelled the airport. Several hours later Saigon fell into the the hands of the Communist troops, marking an end to the Vietnam war

Evacuation: The last U.S. Marine helicopter lifts off from the landing pad atop the U.S. Embassy during the evacuation of Saigon

After signing a ceasefire, the last American troops left Vietnam in March 1973, almost 58,000 are dead, and over 1,000 are missing in action. Some 150,000 Americans were seriously wounded.

But the unrest continues as southern and northern forces are accused each other of breaking the terms of the truce and fighting continues. 

The north make progressive gains and the south's defences weaken as the US withdraws aid - Hanoi launches an offensive to gain control of the whole country.

The south Vietnamese army crumble faster than expected and millions of refugees fled towards Saigon.

On 21 April, the South Vietnamese President Nguyen Van Thieu resigns and flees to Taiwan.

Six days later the city was surrounded and on 29 April the US ordered the helicopter evacuation of 7,000 American administrators and South Vietnamese from the city.

Refugees battled to join the exodus.

The following day, NVA tanks drove unopposed into central Saigon.

The city was renamed Ho Chi Minh City.

He then went and picked the group up and they were flown out of the country to safety.

Over
the next four days as fear gripped the city, John repeated this ruse 10 times, filling out papers with 
groups of six or eight.

The
women and children were all transported out safely, but it was even 
more risky to help the husbands that were left behind as they were more 
of a target.

Mr Riordon managed to get them all fake adoption papers as his sons and they took a U.S. embassy evacuation bus to the airport.

But they were terrified when the bus 
was stopped at a checkpoint and a Vietnamese police officer stepped on 
the bus to carry out an inspection.

A
Vietnamese women jumped up and shoved a bag containing a bribe into his
hands and the bus moved on to airport safely.

The group were one of 
the last to fly out of Saigon - after that the only method of escape were
the helicopters at the U.S. embassy.

Later
that week the Vietcong and North Vietnamese Army took over and raised 
their flag over the South Vietnamese presidential palace

The fall of Saigon, two years after American troops left Vietnam, is seen by many as the final day of the Vietnam war.

The Citibank employees were flown out to either Guam or the Philippines and then all reunited at Camp Pendleton in California.

Despite defying his company's orders on his return Mr Riordon was hailed a hero and given a bonus.

Citibank also spent a million dollars to resettle all the employees, giving them and many of the spouses, jobs.

Recently Mr Riordon and his 'family' met up in Long Island - his 'children' call him 'Papa.'

Chi
Vu, one of the women he saved told CBS: 'He's so kind, you know, to 
stay behind and take-- took us out. He did so much for us. Saved my kids
and my husband.'

Tens
of tens of thousands of South Vietnamese civilians associated with the 
southern regime were evacuated in the days preceding the capture of 
Saigon.

The evacuation culminated in Operation Frequent Wind, which was the largest helicopter evacuation in history.
