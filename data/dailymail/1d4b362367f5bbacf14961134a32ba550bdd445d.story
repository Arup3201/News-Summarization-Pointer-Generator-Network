Neil Warnock wants to steer Crystal Palace to safety this season because he feels he owes the club's supporters.

Warnock left Selhurst Park for QPR in March 2010 after Palace had been put into administration and the club was fraught with financial problems.

He returned to the Eagles a fortnight ago after Tony Pulis' shock departure and Warnock admits he wants to pay the fans back for the loyalty they have shown him.

'I do feel it's the right club for me and I do feel like I owe a little bit to the fans,' Warnock said.

'The fans know how it was when we were in administration - it was very difficult to keep the boat rolling.'

He added: 'When I came back with QPR I thought I'd get a bit of stick.

'It was probably the most emotional day I've ever had in my life because the majority of the ground was behind me.

'It was a fabulous day for me so it's nice to get the opportunity now, when it's a bit hectic again, to try to steady the ship.'

Pulis was named the Barclays Premier League manager of the season after leading Palace to 11th place in the table and the players were disappointed with his exit 48 hours before the start of the campaign.

Warnock, however, insists there has been no bitterness towards him and has backed his players to prove the doubters wrong.

'I think they had a great time with Tony,' Warnock said.

'I'm sure certain people think we might plummet now we've got new people on board but I don't see that.

'I look at where these players finished in the league table and I think they warranted that - if anything I think we're even better now.'

Club-record signing James McArthur could make his debut against Burnley on Saturday along with fellow new arrivals Kevin Doyle and Zeki Fryers.

Palace are open to sending some of their fringe players out on loan, including Paddy McCarthy and Peter Rammage, but Warnock says he is happy with the balance of his squad.

'We were looking for players that weren't going to disrupt anything already here because the dressing room is probably the most important thing,' he said.

'I'm just looking forward to the game now and seeing how we play and it'll be nice with the crowd - Selhurst Park is a very special place.

'I'm sure Burnley will be looking at this game as a winnable game and we'll be the same.'
