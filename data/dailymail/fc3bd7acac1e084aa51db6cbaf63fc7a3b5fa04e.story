A young boy learned his lesson the hard way after his father made him hold up a sign on a busy Texas highway admitting he was a school bully.

Jose Lagares stood next to his son as he flashed a cardboard poster at the
 Ft. Hood Street and W. Veterans Memorial Boulevard intersection on Tuesday afternoon saying: 'I am a bully. Honk if you hate bullies.'

Although he has come under fire for his 'bad parenting', Lagares said his tough love approach has worked.

Punishment: Jose Lagaras forced his son, a fourth grader, to hold a sign on a busy highway admitting he was a bully

The fourth grader, who has not been named, apologized of his own accord to the student he bullied, NBC News reported.

Lagares, from Killeen, said his son was a repeat bully whose behavior worsened despite punishment such as grounding and even
 hard labor.

Public humiliation, he said, was ' just the final straw, and it seemed to work.'

'Bullying
 is also a form of public humiliation. Maybe he understands that when he
 humiliates someone publicly that doesn't feel good,' Lagares told wwlp.com.

'Hopefully he'll take that with him so the next time he tries to bully 
someone he'll think about it twice.'

Embarrassing: Jose Lagares made his son hold up a sign admitting he was a bully on Tuesday afternoon at the Ft. Hood Street and W. Veterans Memorial Boulevard intersection in Texas. His son apologized to his victim the next day of his own accord

However Lagares said he was inundated with negative criticism from passersby, accusing him of being a bad parent.

The next day, the unrepentant father went to the same intersection holding a bright orange sign that said: 'I'm not sorry. Honk to stop bullying.'

'I've gotten that I'm lazy, that's 
one that really sticks out to me that ya know there was other options 
that I could of done and all that, not knowing my story with my child,' Lagares said.

'I refuse to allow my child to be somebody
 else's pain. Ya know, we don't need another Columbine, and we don't 
need another Solomon Harris.

'Ya know, we don't need that to happen, and I
 refuse for my child to be the cause of that.'

Unrepentant: After Jose Lagares was criticized for making his son hold up a sign on a busy highway admitting he was a bully, he held up his own sign the next day saying he wasn't sorry for his choice of punishment

Disciplinarian: Jose Lagares said his son learned his lesson and apologized to his bullying victim at school the next day of his own accord

While numerous passersby criticized Lagares, Melissa Esau stopped to thank him for sending a 'positive message'.

I just wanted to thank him for taking some responsibility and just having his son say, hey, this isn't right,' she told NBC News.
