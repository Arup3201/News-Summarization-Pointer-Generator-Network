A group describing itself as a 'Militant Resistance' to a 'corrupt police state' has offered $5000 for details of Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson's whereabouts, MailOnline can reveal.

Officer Wilson, 28, has been in hiding on paid leave ever since he gunned down unarmed teenager Michael Brown, 18, on 9 August.

Now, in one of a series of incendiary tweets the RbG Black Rebels have stated, 'We are paying $5k cash for location of Ofc. Darren Wilson. Real $, no joke, no crime we just wana get his photo an ask him a few questions.'

And though the RbG Black Rebels insist this is not a bounty on the officer's head, the chilling offer is set in the context of a stream of violent online posts boasting of 'combat experience', 'stockpiling' ammunition, cleaning out gun stores and being #WarReady.

The incendiary tweet from the group: part of a twitter feed which includes references to 'war ready' which is likely to increase tensions in Ferguson ahead of the expected grand jury verdict on the shooting of Michael Brown by police office Darren Wilson

The 'Black Rebels' have used their Twitter feed to claim the police are preparing for 'war' when the grand just verdict is announced, which could be as early as Wednesday

Pointed: The feed includes a reference to ammunition which will 'solve a lot of problems'. The FBI has already warned that extremist violence is 'likely'.

Typical of the reponse elicited by the offer is one follower's demand, '@BlackRebels_Stl@OpFerguson Yank that bastard off the street. He is a murderer running free still.' 

Governor Jay Nixon has already declared a State of Emergency and called in the National Guard in anticipation of the violence that FBI agents have described as 'inevitable' when the Grand Jury charged with deciding the fate of Officer Wilson, 28, delivers their verdict.

Having promised that a decision would be reached 'by late November' it now seems likely that the Grand Jury will return that decision this week.

A series of Grand Jury leaks, and Missouri law which allows officers to use lethal force if they believe their life to be in danger, have led many to believe that Wilson will not be indicted on murder charges as Brown's family and supporters hope.

It is three months since Wilson pumped six bullets into the teenager as he walked down the middle of the road with a friend.

In the wake of the shooting which ignited racial tension in the Missouri town rioters took to the streets armed with Molotov cocktails and chanting the slogan 'Hands Up Don't Shoot' - a reference to some witness accounts that the teenager had his hands up in surrender when Wilson fired off his fatal volley of shots.

RbG Black Rebel's disturbing offer and tweets show the seething anger and hunger for violence among some agitators. They have no faith in the judicial system and seem intent on ignoring official calls for peaceful protest and calm.

As reported by MailOnline that chatter has extended to St Louis own police officers.

Writing on the forum St Louis Cop Talk one user writing under the username 'A Concerned Cop' advised residents, 'If you do not have a gun, get one and get one soon. We will not be able to protect you or your family.'

In what appeared to be a direct strike at Governor Nixon's decision to activate the National Guard rather than entrusting St Louis's own force with policing the streets of Ferguson, the user continued, 'It will be your responsibility to protect them. Our gutless commanders and politicians have neutered us.

'I'm serious, get a gun, get more than one, and keep one with you at all times.'

Killed: Michael Brown, 18, (left) was shot dead by police officer Darren Wilson (right) in Ferguson, Missouri.

Pressure point: Protests on both sides of the argument over whether Darren Wilson should be charged with a crime for shooting unarmed Michael Brown have already started in Ferguson ahead of the grand jury verdict. So far all have been peaceful

Memorial: Michael Brown's high school graduation photo at one of the improvised memorials to his shooting more than three months ago. 

Speaking on Monday St Louis Mayor Francis Slay voiced support for Governor Nixon's decision to active the National Guard.

He said that the Guard 'will be used in a secondary role' and could potentially be stationed at places such as shopping centers and government buildings.

He said, 'The way we view this, the Guard is not going to be confronting the protesters and will not be on (the) front line interacting with demonstrators.'

Gun sales have been said to be increasing. One gun shop owner, Steve King of Metro Shooting Supplies, in nearby Bridgeton, told the Washington Post sales had increased from a typical 30 or 40 firearms a week to 250 this week.

'These people are afraid.One hundred percent of them are buying because of Ferguson,' he said.

When violence first exploded in Ferguson and cities across the states as the Michael Brown's shooting ignited underlying racial tensions in Missouri and beyond, the National Guard's intervention saw a visible reduction in violence.

Missouri State Highway Patrol had initially been tasked with policing the protests when Governor Nixon first declared a state of emergency in August.

Their tactics of enforcing curfews, lining up armored vehicles and attempting to drive protesters back with tear-gas and rubber bullets were widely criticized for only adding to tensions.

Another of the incendiary tweets posted by the militant group 

Flashpoint: Pattie Canter, a supporter of police officer Darren Wilson, argues with critics of the police in Ferguson at a demonstration yesterday. Larger protests are expected when the grand jury reach its verdict

Officers were clearly seen walking with guns un-holstered and raised towards unarmed protesters.

The National Guard's strategy of working with community leaders and moving among protesters rather than drawing battle lines saw a marked drop in violence.

According to reports based on unnamed sources in the St Louis Dispatch officer Wilson has told authorities that he realized that Brown and his friend matched the description of two youths involved in a theft at a convenience store just minutes before he saw them walking down the middle of the road.

He has claimed that, having passed the teenagers whom he told not to walk in the middle of the road, he then doubled back and some sort of confrontation with Brown occurred at his police vehicle door.

The reports state that Wilson claimed a struggle for his gun ensued resulting in him firing two shots and hitting Brown in the hand.

When the youth tried to escape he allegedly stated that he continued to shoot, firing off the fatal volley of shots when Brown turned and 'charged' back towards him.

This account is in stark contrast with that of several eye witnesses and Brown's companion who have claimed that the unarmed teen had his hands up, or by his side, and begged the officer 'Stop shooting.'

St Louis Prosecutor Bob McCulloch's office have promised to unseal and release all evidence reviewed by the Grand Jury following its decision.
