A woman who admitted posting nude photos of her husband’s new girlfriend online attacked a local TV reporter as she left court in Hanover Township, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday.

In January Julie Ottaviani had hacked into her husband’s computer and cell phone and stolen naked pictures of his girlfriend which she'd then sent to the woman’s 14 year-old son.

On Tuesday Ottaviani, 54, pleaded guilty to charges of corruption of minors and criminal use of a computer.

As she left court, Ottaviani lost her cool when Newswatch 16 reporter Bill Wadell asked if she wanted to apologize for what had happened.

Seeing red, Ottaviani first grabbed his mic and wrestled with him while family members attempted to convince her to let go.

That scuffle ended but when Wadell again asked if she wanted to apologize, Ottaviani lashed out and hit him in the face with her purse as a family member tried to block the camera from seeing.

‘Get out of my face!’ she yelled, moments before being whisked away in a car.

Hanover Township police are now investigating Ottaviani’s actions outside the court hearing, reports WNEP TV.

Gary Ottaviani, the defendant's ex-husband, told police in January that someone had hacked into his email account and copied two nude pictures of his girlfriend he had sent to his email from his cellphone, police said.

The man's girlfriend found out about the nude photos when Julie Ottaviani created a Facebook account under the name Chris Richardson.

She then posted the pictures she obtained from hacking into her ex-husband's cell phone on Facebook and sent a friend request to her ex-husband's girlfriend's 14-year-old son, police said.

The son then told his mother to take down the photos, but she was unable to as they were posted from the defendant's fictitious account, police said.

Investigators went to Julie Ottaviani's home to inquire about someone hacking into her ex-husband's email address.

Ottaviani had told police that she had posted naked photos of her ex-husband's girlfriend online because she wanted the woman's children to hurt as much as her's did

She initially blamed her ex-husband, saying he did it to make it look as if she did, police said.

After investigators asked her why the fictitious Facebook account was created in her house, she told police she wanted to get her ex-husband's girlfriend fired, police said.

'I wanted her kid to hurt as much as mine,' Julie Ottaviani told police.

She also told police she sent out friend requests to friends of her ex-husband's girlfriend so that they can see what kind of person she really is, police said.

Footage of Tuesday incident outside court was posted on YouTube by WNEP TV and a relative of Julie Ottaviani was quick to defend her.

Corey Ottaviani accused the TV station of ‘brutally editing’ the incident and that the reporter had 'grabbed her first.'

He said Julie Ottaviani had previously had a clean record, suffered from a 'severe mental disease' and had gone through a 'bad divorce'. 

Come on if you went through a bad divorce when they wer together for a very very long time. wouldn't it make you uneasy and on edge and after being mobbed up on unexpectedly lash out. Plus, he said, her purse had been empty.
