A school at the centre  of an alleged takeover plot by Islamist hardliners could now face strict government sanctions following a snap Ofsted inspection.

Park View Academy in Birmingham has been condemned in recent weeks for increasing ‘Islamisation’, hosting extremist preachers during assemblies and apparently encouraging girls to cover their hair.

Yesterday it emerged that the Education Funding Agency had launched a separate probe into the school over the misuse of public funds to pay £70,000 for playground loudspeakers to summon pupils to Islamic prayers.

Park View Academy, where Lindsey Clark is executive head, allegedly spent £70,00 on speakers to summon pupils to Islamic prayer

Whistleblowing teachers have claimed 
the school is in the hands of a group of extremists who infiltrated the 
governing body, forcing non-Muslims out and replacing them with 
hardliners.

Earlier this 
month a letter was circulated referring to a ‘Trojan Horse’ plot for 
Muslim extremists to take over the running of schools. The authenticity 
of the letter is unclear but its very existence led to a flood of 
allegations from staff at schools in the city.

Following
 the Ofsted inspection, Park View – previously rated ‘outstanding’ – 
will be downgraded to ‘inadequate’. This enables Ofsted to place the 
school, in the inner-city suburb of Alum Rock, in special measures, 
giving the watchdog the power to remove the governing body.

Meanwhile,
 according to the Sunday Telegraph, pupils at Oldknow Primary in Small 
Heath were led in anti-Christian chanting by a teacher in assembly.

Oldknow,
 which like Park View has many Muslim pupils and its own madrasa – or 
Islamic school – has organised at least three trips to the holy city of 
Mecca, subsidised from public funds, and requires all pupils to learn 
Arabic.

Its respected 
non-Muslim head-teacher, Bhupinder Kondal, recently left her post for 
resisting this increasingly radical agenda, according to fellow 
teachers. Mrs Kondal is among four of the school’s six-strong senior 
management team who have left in the past six months.

Park View School in Birmingham, It is currently under investigation by the Department for Education

Last
 week it emerged how other teachers were forced out by hardliners in a 
similar way after opposing plans to ban sex education and stop the 
teachings of other religions.

Michael
 White, a former associate headteacher at Park View, described the 
latest action taken by Ofsted as ‘a step in the right direction’.

But
 he condemned Birmingham City Council for ‘failing to take action at the
 time’. Mr White said the council and Government have been ‘too afraid 
to upset communities, choosing to sweep things under the carpet’.

It
 is not known whether the decision to retire by Park View’s current 
head, Lindsey Clark, is related to pressure from Islamists on the 
governing body. Khalid Mahmood, Labour MP for Birmingham’s Perry Barr, 
urged the Department for Education to replace the governing body at the 
academy.

Calling for a full
 inquiry, he said: ‘Local council officers have taken their eye off the 
ball. The council has allowed these governors to take over these schools
 under the radar.’

At 
another successful primary school, Springfield, similar tactics are 
being used according to the Sunday Telegraph. Headteacher Christopher 
Webb is under ‘non-stop attack’ by radical members of the governing 
body, teachers said.

Similar
 techniques were used to oust former head Noshaba Hussain 20 years ago. 
Mrs Hussain said she was ‘an example of how the plan worked perfectly’.
