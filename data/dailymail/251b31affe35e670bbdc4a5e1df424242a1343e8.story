Australian centre Adrian Purtell has become the latest Bradford player to commit his future to the club after agreeing a new one-year deal.

The 29-year-old is the 15th member of coach James Lowes' current squad to re-sign ahead of the Bulls' 2015 campaign in the Kingstone Press Championship and takes his squad total to 23.

'I am very grateful to the club and Jimmy for giving me the opportunity to remain a Bradford player for another year,' said the former Canberra and Penrith player who made a full recovery from a heart attack in 2012.

Commitment: 15 members of the Bradford Bulls squad have signed new deals with the club

'I see the one-year deal as a launchpad, ahead of what is going to be a massive year for me personally.

'I cannot speak on behalf of the rest of the team but I am desperate to ensure an instant return to Super League next year. I feel as though we have a point to prove and things to put right.

'A fantastic squad is being put together behind the scenes, which I believe will give us a great chance of achieving just that.'

Lowes said: 'Adrian is a very experienced player, who boasts bags of quality.

'He was very keen to stay and I know how determined he is to play a part in what we hope to achieve next year.

'Adrian represents another fantastic addition to what is already a promising squad. I cannot wait to get going with pre-season training in October.'
