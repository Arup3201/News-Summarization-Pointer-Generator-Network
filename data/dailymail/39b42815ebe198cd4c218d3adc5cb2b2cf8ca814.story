Captured American fugitive George Wright suffers from various health problems and should not be extradited from Portugal to the U.S., his wife said today.

Speaking at their home in Almocageme near Lisbon, Maria do Rosario Valente said that Wright suffers from glaucoma, 'very, very high' blood pressure caused by recent stress, and has complained of chest pains.

She said: 'We're having a bunch of tests done to see what's his current health condition.'

'Unwell': Fugitive George Wright looks at his wife Maria do Rosario Valente in their kitchen at home in Almocageme, near Lisbon, on Friday. She claims he suffers from various health problems and should not be extradited from Portugal to the U.S.

Wright's lawyer Manuel Luis Ferreira 
said he intends to include his client's poor health in his legal 
arguments against extradition.

Mr Ferreira said: 'I didn't initially realise how bad he was. Now I've got to know him, I know his problems.'

The U.S. wants Wright returned to serve the remainder of his 15- to 30-year sentence for a 1962 murder in New Jersey.

The 68-year-old was on the run for 41 years until his 
arrest in Portugal a month ago.

He was convicted of the murder of Walter
Patterson, a service station worker in Wall Township, New Jersey. He broke out of 
the Bayside State Prison in Leesburg, New Jersey, in 1970 after serving 
more than seven years.

The FBI says Wright also was part of a 
Black Liberation Army group that hijacked a U.S. plane from Detroit 
Metropolitan Airport to Algeria in 1972. After that, Wright went on the 
lam.

The couple married in 1991 and have two children. Wright is currently under house arrest and wears an electronic tag as legal proceedings about his extradition take place

Walter Patterson's daughter, Ann Patterson, now 63, said she wants Wright extradited to serve the rest of his sentence.

She said that recent weeks have caused her family sleepless nights. "Our world has been turned upside down," she said. "We've now had to grieve for our father for the second time when we never should have had to the first time."

She declined to comment on Wright's lawyer's plans to use his health condition as a reason to fight extradition.

Ms Valente said her husband, who she has lived with for 20 years, regrets his criminal past and has become a more peaceful man since his days in the Black Liberation Army.

As he was: Wright has been on the run 
since 1970. His wife (right) claims her husband regrets his criminal past

Hideout: The house where Wright has lived for more than 20 years

Wright was initially placed in a 
Lisbon jail pending the outcome of the court case, but two weeks ago the
judge allowed him to return home on condition he remains inside the 
house and wears an electronic tag that monitors his movements. Wright 
cannot stray beyond the front door into the garden.

Wright,
a tall, slim man with his head shaved and wearing glasses, is not 
allowed to discuss his extradition case due to Portugal's judicial 
secrecy laws.

'He regrets 
the choices he made,' Ms Valente said of her husband's past. 'If he 
could, probably he'd have made different choices.'

Many
locals in this hamlet near Lisbon describe Wright as a friendly, 
church-going family man. He has a grown daughter and son with Valente. 
Some assumed he was from Africa when he moved here.

Hijack: Dressed as a priest, Wright hijacked a plane bound for Detroit in 1972. FBI agents tried to negotiate with them before they escaped to Algeria with a $1million ransom

Wright joined the Black Liberation Army, above, who lived as a 'family' in New York

Ms Valente said: 'If the purpose of sending someone to jail is to rehabilitate them, then that job is done.'

Wright's
lawyer argues that Wright is now a Portuguese citizen and should be 
allowed to serve the remainder of his sentence in Portugal, where his 
wife and two grown children live.

Wright
got Portuguese citizenship through marriage in 1991 after 
Guinea-Bissau, a former Portuguese colony in West Africa, gave him the 
new name of 'Jose Luis Jorge dos Santos' - the one he uses in Portugal -
and made him a citizen.

The
identity from Guinea-Bissau was granted after the country gave Wright 
political asylum in the 1980s, and that was accepted by Portugal, 
according to the lawyer.
