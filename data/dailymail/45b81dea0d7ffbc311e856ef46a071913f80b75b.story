Nestle has sliced its Killer Python lolly in half in a bid to help Australians better manage their health.

The new 'treat size' Allen's Killer Python measures 21cm instead of 32.5cm and weighs 24g instead of 47g.

Nestle has also reduced the size of Smarties 'fun size' boxes from 20g to 16g.

The move is part of Nestle's efforts to help Australians improve their health by controlling the amount of food they eat - 'especially treats'.

The company said the Killer Pythons still have the same 'recipe, taste and stretchiness' but the new size cuts the lolly's kilojoules from 630 to 336, meaning a 10-year-old can run it off in 30 minutes instead of one hour.

Customers have expressed their outrage over the move but Nestle's General Manager of Confectionery, Martin Brown, said it was the 'right thing to do'.

'I think lollies are just such a fun part of growing up and people have got a lot of passion for them, I really understand that, l used to love eating Killer Pythons as a kid,' Mr Brown told Daily Mail Australia.

'I can understand why there will be some disappointed Python fans, it's a short term sacrifice because it will upset customers and we'll sell less Pythons but it's the right thing to do for ongoing trust.

'This is a really important initiative for a product primarily eaten by kids, getting it at the right portion.'

The company said the new treat size Killer Pythons bags are the same price as the old ones, but have gone up in weight, so customers will be getting more lolly snakes in smaller portion sizes.

The recommended retail price on individual Killer Pythons will be halved from $1 to 50 cents. 

Bags of fun size boxes of Smarties have not changed in price or weight.

Customers took to the Allen's Lollies Facebook page to express their outage and label the resized pythons 'just snakes'.

'Devastated that pythons are now 'treat size' …..WHAT???? Python's were pythons because they were BIG – very sad… Not fun for the kids at all any more,' Natika Mitselburg wrote.

'Not cool Allens... not cool... We don't eat them for their nutritional value, we eat them as a treat!! May as well eat snakes,' Claire Taylor wrote.

Meanwhile Jesinta McNaughton wrote: 'Allens lollies who are you to tell the public what and how much we should eat per serving - you don't think people will just eat extra rather than one? 

'Price difference or not - people EXPECT them to be a killer python, this they are not!'
