Leicester have confirmed that backs coach Paul Burke has left the club.

The 41-year-old former Ireland international fly-half linked up with Leicester as a player in 2006, and later joined the backroom team as kicking specialist and assistant backs coach.

He stepped up to become backs coach earlier this year following Matt O'Connor's departure to Leinster.

Leicester Tigers have confirmed that their backs coach Paul Burke has left the club

Leicester have experienced a testing opening two months of the season, losing three of their six Aviva Premiership games and being beaten by European Champions Cup opponents the Scarlets last weekend.

'Paul has been a good servant to the club and was very much liked by players and staff, first as an experienced member of the squad and then as part of the coaching team, initially under Heyneke Meyer and then Richard Cockerill,' Tigers executive chairman Peter Tom told the club's official website.

'We are grateful for Paul's hard work on behalf of the club over the last eight-and-a-half years, and we wish him well for the future.'
