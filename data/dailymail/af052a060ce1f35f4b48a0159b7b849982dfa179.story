Super rich Arabs are spending £4.5million a day in Britain - cementing London's position as the world's top playground for the rich.

Middle Eastern billionaires using the capital to spend their fortune have contributed to a boom in Arab cash pouring into the country.

In total last year £1.25billion was spent in the UK by families from the Middle East - amounting to some £25,000 for every holiday.

Visitors from the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and the the rest of the Middle East were by far the biggest spenders on their trips to Britain

Americans as a whole spend more in the UK than Arabs - but only because they far outnumber Middle Eastern tourists. On day-to-day spending, Arabs are the biggest overseas shoppers in the world

UAE visitors meanwhile lavished £156 a day, according to the Office for National Statistics. They are the biggest spenders of all foreign visitors to Britain. 

Only tourists under the title 'other middle east' spend more - at some £173 a day. Egyptians are the third biggest spenders, handing over £149 a day during their stay.

Only American tourists as a whole contribute more than Arabs to Britain's tourist industry - spending a total of £1.5billion last year.

But the number of visitors from the US far outstrips those from the Middle East - leaving the spending per person from the Arab world way ahead of that from the Americans.

Arabs now spend twice as much as Australians, Germans and French - and 50 per cent more than Americans.

Spending by overseas visitors last year soared by 12.7 per cent since 2012 to £21billion. More than half of this - some 53.6 per cent - was spent in London.

The amount spent by overseas visitors in the capital itself almost doubled between 2003 and 2013.

In total, overseas visitors spent more than £11billion in London last year - compared to under £6billion in 2003.

The tourist spending figures were buried in the latest Office for National Statistics visitor statistics released this month.

The figures showed the highest recorded number of overseas visits to the UK since 1961.

In total there were 32,813,000 visits to the UK in 2013 - a 5.6 per cent increase since 2012.

Over the same year, spending by overseas visitors increased by 12.7 per cent to £21billion overall.

The number of visits to London in 2013 was the highest since 1961, with half of all visitors to the UK visiting London.

Overall, there were 16.8million overseas visitors to the capital in 2013 - spending £11billion.

Two-thirds of visitors from North America and other countries outside of Europe visited London during their visit to the UK last year. This is compared to just under half of European tourists visited London.

Half of all foreign trips to London were for a holiday, instead of work.

Over the last ten years, the number of overseas visitors visiting London for a holiday has increased from 4.9million in 2003 to 8.5million in 2013.

Over the same period business visits have increased by 18.5% and visits to friends and family increased by 34.8%.
