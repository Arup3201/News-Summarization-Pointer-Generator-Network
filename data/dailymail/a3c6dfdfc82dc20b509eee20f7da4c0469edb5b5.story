The head of U.S. intelligence has warned Congress that not renewing the NSA's controversial phone snooping program will 'raise the risk' of another terror incident.

James Clapper claims failing to extend part of the Patriot Act, which allows the bulk collection of telephone records, will take away a vital tool in the kit of the intelligence agency.

Should Congress not renew Section 215 - due to expire on June 1 - then it must be prepared to shoulder the blame should an 'untoward incident' take place, the Director of National Intelligence added during a question and answer session in New York on Monday.

Warning: Clapper told a meeting in New York that failure to renew Section 215 of the Patriot Act - which allows mass collection of phone records - would effectively raise the risk of a terrorist incident

'In the end, Congress giveth and Congress taketh away,' Clapper told the group gathered at the Council on Foreign Relations. 

'If the congress in its wisdom decides the juice is not worth the squeeze that's fine: the intelligence community will do all it can within the law to do what it can to protect the country.

'But I have to say, every time we lose another tool in our tool kit, it raises the risk.

'If that tool is taken away from us, and some untoward incident happens which could have been thwarted if we had it, I just hope that everyone involved in that decision assumes responsibility.'  

'Insurance': Section 215 - revealed by Edward Snowden - has not prevented a single incident since it was brought in

Section 215 of the Patriot Act - which also allows the NSA to obtain surveillance warrants without naming the person being wiretapped, as well as allowing the surveillance of foreigners suspected of terrorist activity but not affiliated with a terrorist organisation - was one of the most controversial powers brought to light by former security contractor Edward Snowden.

It has since been claimed Section 215, set up in the wake of September 11, has failed to stop one terrorist incident, leading to calls for it being reformed, or dropped altogether.

Senator Patrick Leahy brought forward a bill last year, supported by Clapper, which  would have meant phone companies were in charge of keeping the records rather than the FBI or NSA.

But Republicans blocked the sweeping overhaul when it came before the Senate last November.

However, Clapper remains a defender of the program.

'Section 215, to me, is like my fire insurance policy,' he said on Monday. 'My house has not burned down, but every year I buy fire insurance just in case.'
