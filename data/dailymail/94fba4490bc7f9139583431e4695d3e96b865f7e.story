Bill Clinton and Sean Penn attended a hotel opening in Haiti on Tuesday during a charity trip to the impoverished country as the Hollywood actor remained silent on the row over his xenophobic Oscars remarks.

Penn was criticized after remarks he made about Mexican-born Alejandro Inarritu's 'green card' status as he presented the director's Academy Award on Sunday. Penn declined to speak to reporters in Haiti over the furor.

The actor attended the opening of a new 175-room, Marriott Hotel in the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince along with the former president in what backers and officials hope will spur further economic development in the impoverished country.

The ceremony to mark the opening of the hotel was also attended by Haitian President Michel Martelly and Prime Minister Evans Paul.

Penn left town the day after Sunday's glitzy ceremony to travel to the earthquake-ravaged Caribbean nation as part of a delegation led by the former U.S. President, who is also the UN Special Envoy for Haiti. 

The actor was a major player in efforts to rebuild Haiti after the January 2010 earthquake that devastated the country.

The actor was subsequently honored for his relief work with the 2012 Peace Summit Award at the 12th World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates in Chicago.

However a shadow was cast over this week's charity trip by his on-stage remarks on Sunday.

As Penn presented the Academy Award for Best Picture, he said of Inarritu: 'Who gave this son of a b**** his green card? Birdman.'

Twitter quickly went into meltdown with users denouncing Penn’s ill-judged ‘joke’ as 'insensitive' to the plight of many immigrants in the U.S. and 'racist.'

One of the first to call Penn out was filmmaker and immigration activist Jose Antonio Vargas.

'Mexican director = green card joke. Not funny, just plain xenophobic. Wtf, Sean Penn?!' he tweeted.

Others, including TV presenter Mario Lopez, pointed out that the comment was made about a Mexican director while no one questioned the immigration status of the countless British and Australian actors in attendance. 

The term 'green card' refers to a document that confers permanent residency to immigrants in the United States.

While the remark about Inarritu's immigration status struck many as an insult, the director insisted it was nothing more than a brutal joke between old friends.

'I found it hilarious,' Inarritu said after the ceremony. 'Sean and I have that kind of brutal (relationship) where only true friendship can survive.'

Inarritu directed Penn in his 2003 film, 21 Grams, and the pair remain friends. Penn posed for pictures with Inarritu after the ceremony.

The director, who won three Oscars on Sunday night, said he has told many similarly brutal jokes at Penn's expense. 'I make on him a lot of very tough jokes that I will not tell you,' Inarritu said.

Joke or not, the remark struck many as problematic for an awards ceremony that had been criticized for not having more nominees of color.

Inarritu joked that after his three wins on Sunday, the Academy might institute a residency requirement.

'Maybe next year, the government will inflict some immigration rules (on) the academy. Two Mexicans in a row, that's suspicious, I guess,' the director quipped.

His win in the best directing category marks back-to-back wins for Mexican-born directors; last year director Alfonso Cuaron received the Academy Award for Gravity.

It took some of the sting out of Penn's words, but Inarritu also used the opportunity to celebrate immigrants.  

The director called on his fellow Mexicans to build a better government, and said those who have come to the U.S.  should be afforded the respect that previous generations of immigrants have been given.

'I want to dedicate this award for my fellow Mexicans, the ones who live in Mexico,' Inarritu said.

'I pray that we can find and build the government that we deserve. And the ones that live in this country who are part of the latest generation of immigrants in this country, I just pray that they can be treated with the same dignity and the respect of the ones who came before and (built) this incredible immigrant nation.'

Penn's ill-judged attempt at humor was considered racially insensitive by a number of people on Twitter 

Other people commented that no one would make such a racial-charged 'joke' about the countless Brits and Australians present at the event
