Everton have rewarded Seamus Coleman’s outstanding progress and ended speculation about his future by handing him a new five-year contract.

The Republic of Ireland international has made giant strides since he moved to Goodison Park from Sligo Rovers for £60,000 in 2009 and the past 12 months have been his finest to date, as he was voted into the PFA’s team of the year, as well as being named Everton’s Player of the Season.

His performances had attracted the interest of Arsenal, who viewed Coleman as a potential replacement for Bacary Sagna, but Roberto Martinez first indicated on January 10 that the 25-year-old would be given improved terms.

Staying power: Coleman has penned a  new deal at Goodison Park, snubing a move south to Arsenal

Martinez, 
who is aiming to clinch the signing of Gareth Barry, wants other young 
players such as James McCarthy and Ross Barkley to get new deals, too, 
and Coleman has revealed that his manager’s influence was crucial to him
 re-committing to Everton.

Coleman,
 who last signed new terms as recently as January 2013, said: ‘I think a
 lot of people will realise that last year he had a big part to play.

'The
 previous manager was brilliant with me and Roberto’s come in and 
believed in me as well. He’s been brilliant for me and it was a big 
reason, how respected he is by all the players. 

‘You
 hear about speculation. Obviously your friends and so on read about it,
 but that’s the game we are in – it’s full of speculation.

Gunner stunner: Coleman - in action against Crystal Palace - was one of last season's major success stories

'I never thought about anything else but staying and I’m happy to sign the new contract. More than happy, really. 

‘I’ve
 been at Everton five years now and I love everything around the place. I
 love working with all the players, the staff, the coaching staff - 
everything. It was a very happy decision to make. I was delighted to get
 the chance to sign another contract.

‘With
 the manager and some of the players we have, we’re going to the right 
places. With the Europa League as well next season, I’m looking forward 
to it. 

'I’m
 not reflecting too much on last season. I’m more thinking about what is
 coming up, getting ready to go and try to do as well again.’ 

That
 is a challenging target. He scored seven times in 41 appearances and 
never looked back from the moment Martinez told him in the changing 
rooms at half-time during the opening day 2-2 draw at Norwich 'to keep 
getting forward', which resulted in his first goal.

Screamer: Coleman scored a stunner for the Toffees against Southampton last December

Coleman
 has trust that Martinez, who himself signed a new five-year contract at
 the beginning of June, can keep Everton’s momentum building and he says
 there is no reason why they can’t better their total of 72 points and 
qualify for the Champions League under him.

‘We
 just missed out on Champions League and I think every season you want 
to do a little bit better than you did in the previous one,’ said 
Coleman.

‘We’ve got Europa League now, which will be a good experience for the players, and hopefully we can do well in that.

‘Personally,
 if I can just keep my standards high, train hard and hopefully play on a
 matchday, then it will all be going to plan.’
