The next World Cup will have its very own version of the vuvuzela - a percussion instrument specifically designed to sound a lot less annoying than its predecessor.

The caxirola  will be a stark 
contrast to the brightly coloured 3ft long plastic trumpets that 
blighted the South African football World Cup three years ago.

Instead
of emitting an ear-piercing foghorn screech that led to streams of 
complaints and forced TV viewers to tune out, organisers say the caxirola will be less grating.

Unlike the vuvuzela, which has historical
cultural significance in South Africa, the caxirola has been designed 
especially for use in stadiums.

It makes a rattling sound when shaken and was created in a collaboration between the Brazilian musician Carlinhos Brown and the country's ministry of sports.

The yellow and green percussion instrument is made from recycled plastic and will be handed to fans attending the Confederations Cup in June, the country's unofficial dress rehearsal for the 2014 World Cup.

The President of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff, was quoted in The Independent saying: 'It is an object that has the ability to do two things: to combine the image with sound and take us to our goals.'

A FIFA spokesman promised the instrument would 'add to the fan experience' at the tournaments and help 'create a unique Brazilian atmosphere in the stadiums'.

The deafening sound of the vuvuzela is
etched in many a football fan's mind as the over-riding memory of the 
South African World Cup.

The controversial £2 trumpet produced an uncomfortable 127-decibels, providing a deafening background to the entire tournament.

Louder
than a chainsaw, noisier than a lawnmower and even more ear-splitting 
than a referee’s whistle – experts said it could damage fans' hearing in
as little as 15 minutes.

Their hum, which drowned out 
commentary on television coverage and made viewers feel they were in a 
room full of angry bees, led to the BBC cutting out the sound.

The
instrument also injured Cape Town insurance saleswoman Yvonne Mayer, 
29, who ripped her windpipe after she blew it during a street party.

She was unable to speak or eat for two days and was ordered to rest completely to allow it to heal.
