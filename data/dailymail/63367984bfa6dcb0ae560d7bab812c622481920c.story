They are moments that 'never existed' but the subjects are as real as it gets in the latest works from German photographer Wolfgang Hildebrand, who has merged cityscapes from around the world at different times of the day into single, deceptive images.

Hildebrand, 45, visited cities including Paris, Los Angeles, New York, Bangkok and his home town Hamburg for the project which aims to show them in a different light.

'I am always fascinated by urban landscapes, the temper, the hustle of them, the energy, and of course the constant transformation that takes place,' Hildebrand says.

'Not only the obvious transformations, such as new buildings, but the change that occurs within minutes in an urban surrounding.

'I have compressed the complex perception of urban existence into one single image.'

Wolfgang describes his composite images of the same frame at different times of the day, and even days apart, as a 'new moment'.

'This new moment never really existed, but it looks somehow familiar to the viewer,' he adds. 'Only at second glance do we realise that not all is as it seems, questioning our common photographic perception.'

Each image takes 15 to 20 hours to complete, with Wolfgang spending about three hours researching the location that will best show-off his technique.

Actual shooting time is about five hours across various periods of the day but he uses the photo editing software PanormaStitching and Photoshop.

Wolfgang says: 'People's reactions range from "I don't get it" to "brilliant" and "unbelievable". 

The Kwun Tong District in Hong Kong is captured in the work from Hildebrand which can take up to 20 hours to produce a single shot

Rather than shooting recognisable landmarks, Hildebrand is more fascinated by urban landscapes such as this in  Bangkok's Sathon district

'I have trained my skills for some years now, and after having figured how to use them for this project the work itself isn't difficult at all, it is actually fun!

'The difficulties are more in calculating how the course of time affects the final image.

'For example, a scene that looks nice during daytime may get very boring at dawn, because of closed shop-windows.

'So, most of the locations must be examined and scouted way before the shooting itself takes place.'

'People's reactions range from "I don't get it" to "brilliant" and "unbelievable",' says Hildebrand of works such as this in Bang Rak, Bangkok

Hildebrand included a host of works from his home city of Hamburg, Germany
