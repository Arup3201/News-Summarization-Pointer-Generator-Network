Former Liverpool striker Robbie Fowler is adamant Brendan Rodgers will guide his side into Champions League qualification this season despite a slow start to the campaign.

The reds narrowly missed out on the title last season, having briefly sat top of the table before a late slip-up handed Manchester City the crown.

However Liverpool drew 0-0 with Hull on Saturday which left Rodgers' side seventh in the Premier League and nine points adrift of leaders Chelsea.

'It's not quite clicked but I think we will do,' Fowler told Sky Sports News HQ.

'There is only Manchester City - maybe after a little bit of a blip at the weekend - and Chelsea who are on fire so it's not all bad.

'I think we are not a million miles away and I'm very confident in the squad that Brendan has put together and his ethos, and his mentality.

'I think he will get it right. I don't think he will - I know he will - he's such a good manager.'

Perhaps Fowler has reason to be so forthright as Liverpool staged a dramatic comeback to beat Swansea in the Capital One Cup at Anfield on Tuesday evening.

Former Liverpool midfielder Jan Molby doubts Rodgers can replicate the second-placed finish from last year

However former midfielder Jan Molby,who enjoyed a trophy laden spell at the club between 1984-96, doubts whether the club can match last season's second-placed finish but still expects Liverpool to start climbing the table soon.

'There is maybe four or five clubs certain to perform, which is the likes of Manchester United, Everton, Spurs.

'We are included in that and it's just a case of who finds their form first. I don't think we will ever see a Liverpool season like we saw last season, but I still think there is more to come from this squad.'
