This shocking video shows the extreme lengths impatient drivers will go to to avoid getting stuck behind bin lorries.  

Motorists were filmed mounting the pavement, swerving round lamp posts and careering into people's gardens to get around the vehicle as rubbish collectors made their rounds. 

The video, filmed on the Isle of Wight, has been released by Island Waste Management in a bid to encourage drivers to be more patient on the roads.

A driver drives into a front garden to get around bin collectors in the video which shames reckless driving 

The footage shows drivers mounting pavements and swerving round lamp posts and bollards to avoid getting stuck behind the lorry on the Isle of Wight 

A white van captured on the rubbish lorry's CCTV camera squeezes in between the vehicle and a shop to avoid waiting behind rubbish collectors 

Rubbish collectors have to jump out of the path of an oncoming car as it mounts the pavement to get around the lorry 

In one clip, a white van with a roof rack squeezes itself in between the lorry and a roadside shop, ploughing into its fabric canopy as it slowly pushes past. 

Dozens of other drivers mount the pavement on residential streets to get around the vehicle, forcing rubbish collectors to jump out of their path as they try to empty wheelie bins.

One driver, somewhat unnecessarily, even careers into a front garden to scoot around the lorry.  

A montage of the footage - taken between 2012 and 2013 - was presented to Hampshire Police by the waste management company. 

Twenty of the drivers received a fixed penalty notice between £50 - £100 and three points of their licence.

Around six others were taken to court for dangerous driving placing serious or imminent risk to life. 

All pleaded guilty once shown the video evidence and were given six points and a fine of approximately £600.

The municipal manager of Island Waste Services said the drivers' behaviour put bin collectors at risk

Rob Brooker, Island Waste Services municipal manager said: 'Refuse collections are a vital part of everyday life on the Isle of Wight and the vast majority of drivers are courteous and drive safely past our vehicles and staff. 

'However, there have been occasions where impatient drivers have not only risked their safety, but those of others and our staff. 

'Whilst residents are aware that the refuse collection vehicles will hold up the traffic not all are willing to wait patiently for our staff to go about their work.' 

Sergeant David Sanderson from the Isle of Wight's Roads Policing Unit said: 'I am astonished by the impatience of many drivers and the blatant disregard to their own safety and that of Island Waste Services staff. 

'The highest risk is drivers passing either side of the truck too fast and without due care and attention often being abusive and insulting.

‘Our Roads Policing Unit is committed to working with Island Waste Services to collect evidence and prosecute drivers. We have already issued a number of fixed penalty notices and several drivers are being taken to court.'
