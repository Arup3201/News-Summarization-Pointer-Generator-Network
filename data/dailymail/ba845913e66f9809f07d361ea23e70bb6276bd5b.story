Charged: Jamie Lynn Wilkinson, 34, pictured, from Bensalem in eastern Pennsylvania, is facing two counts of felony child endangerment following the crash on Saturday

A mother-of-four has been charged after she allegedly crashed while drunk driving then fled the scene leaving her two youngest children alone in the car.

Jamie Lynn Wilkinson, 34, from Bensalem in eastern Pennsylvania, is facing two counts of felony child endangerment following the crash on Saturday evening.

She has also been charged with driving under the influence, failure to stop and render aid and two summary counts of causing accident damage to unattended vehicle or property.

According to police, Wilkinson collided with multiple stationary vehicles at around 8 p.m. in Bristol Borough.

They said she then ran away, leaving the two babies - 18 months and six months - alone in the busted vehicle.

The older children, believed to be aged around 10 and 12, were not in the vehicle at the time.

Online court records don't list an attorney for Wilkinson, who was apprehended two blocks from the accident scene on Saturday evening.

Witnesses say that neighbors grabbed the children and cared for them until police arrived.

Both babies were taken to police headquarters, where they had to have their diapers changed because they were soaked with urine, according to police records.

Bucks County Children and Youth then took the children but later released them to Wilkinson's sister, according to the Bucks County Courier Times.

'You are in big trouble here,' Lower Southampton District Judge John Waltman told Wilkinson during her arraignment early Sunday.

Wilkinson told the judge at the hearing that she has four children.

She remained in the Bucks County prison Monday, in lieu of 10 percent of $500,000 bail. She awaits a preliminary hearing which has been scheduled for later this month.
