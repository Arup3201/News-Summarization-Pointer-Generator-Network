When renowned zoologist Dian Fossey, the inspiration behind the film Gorillas in the Mist, was murdered in 1985 there were just 250 mountain gorillas left in Africa’s Virunga mountains.

But 27 years on, numbers of the gentle giants have doubled, thanks to a group of doctors that her work inspired.

The Gorilla Doctors, formed as the 
Virunga Veterinary Center a year after Fossey's death, take care of 
injured and critically ill gorillas and provide medical treatment and 
quarantine of orphans, with as many as eight gorillas cared for 
at any one time.

Starting out with the first Gorilla Doctor - Dr James Foster - the group now employs 16 vets and operates across three countries - the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda and Uganda.

The group rescue gorillas from poacher's snares or when they have been exposed to potentially fatal human viruses, darting the animals with antibiotics or drugging them and operating on the jungle floor.

They have been led for the past 13 years by Dr Mike Cranfield, a faculty member of the Wildlife Health Centre of the University of California Davis and divides his time between Maryland Zoo in Baltimore and central Africa.

But he admits that there are dangers working with such large animals.

He said: 'If the gorilla screams when darted, there is usually chaos and the silverbacks rush in to protect them.'

His 'closest call' came after darting a mother with a sleeping drug so he could treat her sick infant.

He said: 'Because it was so young I tried to work on it without anaesthetising it but it kept screaming and screaming.'

'A silverback had circled by and here I was holding his screaming baby. This silverback was probably about 10 yards from me and was getting very, very close to charging.

'It was one of those moments when our eyes caught and it could have gone either way and it would have been pretty severe.

'So, I just quietly put the baby on the mother and backed off until the trackers and guides were able to come around in a circle to protect me.'

The Gorilla Doctors have carried out more than 150 medical interventions on wild gorillas and adopted more than 20 orphans, many of whom need 24-hour-care suffering from dehydration, mental distress and wounds

Dr Dawn Zimmerman and Dr Eddy Kambale are among the doctors who inspect these young mountain gorillas and Grauer’s gorilla at the Senkwekwe sanctuary in Congo.

The Gorilla Doctors’ outstanding work continues to see mountain gorilla populations rise, while other great apes, such as orangutans, decline.

The last four years have seen the vets and scientists employ increasingly advanced techniques, which they hope will help all critically endangered species, not just gorillas.

The regions the Gorilla Doctors operate in are also one of the most turbulent in the world and has been marred by genocide and war.

In the past six months the team have been unable to monitor the gorillas because M23 rebels, locked in a battle with Congolese government forces, have taken over much of the Virunga National Park.

They cannot say if any Gorillas have been killed in crossfire or hunted for meat during this period.

However, Dr Cranfield believes most of the fighters see the financial and altruistic benefits of protecting the gorillas, and will not harm them indiscriminately.

Aside from increasing the gorilla populations, his proudest achievement is seeing talented African vets ‘blossoming’ and becoming independent.

Dr Cranfield hopes they can eventually double the population of mountain gorillas to more than 1,500.

It is expensive work at an estimated cost of £600,000 per year but Dr Cranfield believes it is worth every penny.

He added: 'It is extremely important to safeguard the mountain gorillas, our close relatives, for so many reasons, if not just as a symbol that conservation can work and save a magnificent species but also as a financial treasure to the host countries.'
