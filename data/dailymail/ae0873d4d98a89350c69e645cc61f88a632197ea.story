The complex structure of transport networks across the world's major cities has been laid strikingly bare in a series of maps that plot taxi journeys. 

But in addition to unveiling how residents navigate their cities, the maps also highlight the contrast between rich, tech-savvy areas with the less affluent neighbourhoods.

The maps have been released by taxi firm Uber to celebrate the service launching in Beijing - bringing the total number of cities on the scheme to 100.

As part of the Uber 100 project, the San Francisco-based firm has plotted the major routes its drivers take across all of these cities, including London, New York, Sydney, Mumbai, Moscow, Tokyo, Barcelona, and more.

Taxi firm Uber has launched in Beijing, taking its total number of cities to 100. To celebrate, the firm has created the Uber 100 project and plotted the major routes from all of these cities on to maps. This includes Tokyo, pictured, which has a spider-like reach with legs reaching around the city centre, shown in bright blue

Uber is a smartphone taxi app that lets people hail a cab from their phone. It lets users compare rates and add credit cards to an account so they don't need cash.

The service launched in California in 2010 and has grown from 35 cities last summer to a century this month.

'In 2010, Uber started as simply a big idea for a better way to get around,' said Uber. 'With today's launch in Beijing - four years and millions of trips later -we're now moving people in 100 cities around the world.'

As a result, it is used by people who can afford smartphones in the first place, but also afford the taxi journeys, and this give a clear indication of economic differences. Uber's own stats also reveal the majority of its users are around 30.

London, pictured, has the most sprawling and far-reaching map in Uber's collection. The two black sections in among the complex blue lines is the pedestrianised Hyde Park. As expected, the centre of the city is shown in bright blue, but there is also a hub of activity to the east of the capital towards the O2 venue in Greenwich. The straggly lines to the west are the major routes to Heathrow airport. Lines are paler as they approach the suburbs, especially passed Bermondsey and towards Croydon

New York's distinctive shape is instantly recognisable in the Uber map of the U.S city, as is the economic split. The brightest, and therefore busiest, stretches of the city are in Manhattan, especially around Central Park. The lines become thinner towards Harlem, and the poorer neighbourhoods of the Bronx. Elsewhere, Newark's sparse lines almost fade into the background. There is additionally a hub on Brooklyn Bridge, and on Route 278 that surrounds the neighbourhood, but not in inner Brooklyn

Mumbai's map looks like an elongated face, with the Sanjay Gandhi National Park blocking out the eyes, Malabar Hill representing the nose and the Back Bay appearing to be an open mouth. Bright blue lines plot the popular port hotspots in the southeast of the city. The map also reveals the major routes into and out of the city and highlights the relatively few journeys made across the Vashi Bridge to the suburbs

The cities are marked as nodes and 
plotted on a larger map of the world. Clicking on a node lets you 
download the map for that city.

As expected, the busiest and most 
affluent locations within these major cities are typically in the 
centre, and around the airport.

The
 suburbs where house prices are typically cheaper, and residents are 
older - based on figures from the World Health Organisation - have much 
few journeys and appear pale in comparison to the bright blue centres.

London has the most sprawling and far-reaching map in Uber’s collection. The two black sections in among the complex blue lines is the pedestrianised area of Hyde Park, while Regent’s Park and Hampstead Heath are blacked out further north.

As expected, the centre of the city is shown in bright blue, but there is also a hub of activity to the east of the capital towards the O2 venue in Greenwich.

The straggly lines to the west are the major routes to Heathrow airport. Lines are paler as they approach the suburbs, especially passed Bermondsey and towards Croydon.

Elsewhere, roads around the Royal Botanic Gardens and Museum of Contemporary Art in the centre of the Sydney map, pictured, are a wave of bright blue, as is Sydney Harbour Bridge. It is particularly bright in the affluent regions of Neutral Bay above the harbour, and Double Bay to the east of the Opera House. The main routes of the M5 heading southwest and M4 trailing off to the northwest towards Penrith frame the relatively sparse, poorer districts to the west including Liverpool and Campbelltown

While the maps of New York and San Francisco show the regions as being very narrow, Los Angeles, pictured, is much more flat and square with popular destinations shown as Santa Monica and Manhattan Beach on the coast. Towards Anaheim and the southeast of the region, the lines fade. The map also highlights that Uber is mostly concentrated in the centre of L.A and is rarely used on further outside the area

New York’s distinctive shape is 
instantly recognisable in the Uber map of the U.S city, as is the economic split. The brightest, 
and therefore busiest, stretches of the city are in Manhattan, 
especially around Central Park.

As
 the Seattle map shows, the majority of Uber users in the area travel short 
distances around the downtown area – highlighted by the bright blue mass
 in the centre.

Other popular areas of the coastal seaport include the roads above and around Seattle-Tacoma International airport.

The hilly and green terrain of San Francisco's west coast makes the city's map, pictured, one of the most bare in the collection. Curved lines of Market Street and the Southern Freeway are in stark contrast to the grid system of the Pacific Heights and Mission District in the north. A faint blue line at the top left of the map represents the Golden Gate Bridge

Meanwhile, Moscow's map, pictured, appears as a bullseye with the various ring roads that surround the Russian capital. It stretches out to the west, towards the wealthy districts of Barvikha and Skolkovo but the lines fade to black as Uber journeys travel east, approaching the poorer region of Kapotnya, for example

Meanwhile the outer lying districts 
including Burien and Des Moines in the west, as well as Rainier Valley, 
and the whole of Northeast Seattle are practically desolate on the Uber 
maps.

The main routes of the M5 heading

Around Padstow and down towards Georges River the loops and bendy routes are also highlighted.

Mumbai’s
 map looks like an elongated face, with the Sanjay Gandhi National Park 
blocking out the eyes, Malabar Hill representing the nose and the Back 
Bay appearing to be an open mouth. Bright blue lines plot the popular port hotspots in the southeast of the city.

The map also reveals the major routes into

Meanwhile, Moscow's
 map appears as a bullseye with the various ring roads that 
surround the Russian capital.

It stretches out to the west, towards the wealthy districts of Barvikha and Skolkovo but the 
lines fade to black as Uber journeys travel east, approaching the poorer region of Kapotnya, for example. 

Can you guess which city is represented in this Uber map? It appears to be a rural location but is in fact the bustling city of Barcelona. It highlights the main coastal routes. The region is synonymous with one-way routes and congestion and as a result, many Spaniards use public transport rather than drive, or use the roads

The brightest points are seen at junctions on these ring roads, especially in the south of the city towards Vidnoye.

By highlighting the routes around U.S cities, it’s interesting to see how much they vary in landscape.

While New York and San Francisco for example, are narrow, Los Angeles is much more flat and square with popular destinations shown as Santa Monica and Manhattan Beach on the coast.

Towards Anaheim and the southeast of the region, the lines fade. The map also highlights that Uber is mostly concentrated in the centre of L.A and is rarely in outside, poorer or less populated neighbourhoods.

And back to Europe, what appears to be a rural location is in fact the bustling city of Barcelona. Its map highlights the main coastal routes.

The region is synonymous with one-way routes and congestion and as a result, many Spaniards use public transport rather than drive, or use the roads which may explain the pale blue lines.
