She has a brand new baby to contend with, but Alessandra Ambrosio is not using that as an excuse to slack off on modelling duties.

The Brazilian beauty - more usually seen stripping down to her lingerie as one of Victoria's Secret's Angels - has been cavorting about in the desert, modelling the new 2013 line for affordable Colombian clothing brand Arkitect by Exito.

Wearing floaty, flowery dresses, pretty paisley prints and casual summer frocks in bold block colours - all of which cost less than £30 - 31-year-old Ambrosia proves she has taken no time at all to get back to her stunning self after giving birth to her second child just a few months ago.

Ambrosio, who has been engaged to businessman Jamie Mazur since 2008, gave birth to their second child - a son Noah Phoenix to join four-year-old Anja Louise - in May.

She was today seen enjoying a day out in with her whole family (and wearing a denim outfit to match her daughter's) at the Malibu Chili-cook off Carnival and Fair.

The whole Arkitect catalogue can be viewed here.

Arkitect's new 2013 line includes pretty paisley-print dresses such as this green summer frock, just $79,900 Colombian pesos (£27.60)
