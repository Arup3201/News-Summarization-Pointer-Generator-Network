The Brut Nature Cuvée Grand Cru, produced by champagne maker Alexandre Penet, has just 60 calories in each glass

It is something for dieters to celebrate – and to celebrate with.

This champagne has just 60 calories in each glass, significantly fewer than the 100 calories per glass found in most sparkling wines.

The Brut Nature Cuvée Grand Cru, produced by champagne maker Alexandre Penet, was created by BBC broadcaster turned French wine expert Amanda Thomson.

Miss Thomson says she was inspired to create the low-calorie drink after her previous job as a showbiz reporter made her worry about gaining weight from attending VIP parties.

Miss Thomson said:'We know that the British have a history 
of loving champagne, but in today’s more calorie-conscious market, I’ve 
found a producer who delivers a deliciously dry champagne, but with no 
added sugar.

'The champagne making world is notoriously
difficult to penetrate but in Alexandre Penet I’ve found a French 
partner who is both world renowned yet also innovative.

‘The fashion crowd especially loves the idea of drinking fizz with less fat.’

Miss Thomson left her job as a journalist at BBC 
London and moved her family to Paris, where she studied at the elite 
Cordon Bleu cookery school.

She was then hired by the Penet family to
create a ‘zero dosage’ champagne at their vineyard in the Champagne 
region of north-east France.

Zero-dosage fizz does not  have sugar added during manufacturing, unlike traditional champagne.

It is no lower in alcohol content, but the lack of sugar means it has a dry taste.Skinny champagne is available online at skinnychampagne.com.

Amanda Thomson gave up her carrier as a TV journalist to study in Paris as a wine expert and has now launched a new sugar-free Champagne, 'Brut Nature'
