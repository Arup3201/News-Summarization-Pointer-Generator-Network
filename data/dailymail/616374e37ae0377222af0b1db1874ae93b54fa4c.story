A crack team of officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are working around-the-clock in Dallas to find and monitor every person who may have come in contact with Thomas Eric Duncan, the first person in the United States to be diagnosed with the deadly Ebola infection.

However the 10-person team are yet to track down all the people Duncan may have interacted with - either during his two visits to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital or elsewhere - and continue to monitor those they believe did to see whether they contracted the virus.

The operation is being led infectious disease expert David Kuhar and involves CDC investigators compiling a list of 'potential contacts' and going to their house to meet in-person.

'At each house we spend as much time as necessary with the potential contact,' pediatrician and epidemic intelligence officer Matt Karwowski told The Washington Post.

High alert: A hazmat team member arrives to clean a unit at the Ivy Apartments, where the first confirmed Ebola virus patient in the United States, Eric Thomas Duncan, had been staying with family. The CDC and Texas health officials are scrambling to find anyone who came in contact with Duncan

Arrival: Ebola victim Thomas Eric Duncan, 42 greets a woman and phones his family after landing at Dallas-Forth Worth International Airport on September 20. The CDC now says a list of people in Dallas most at-risk of contracting Ebola stands at about 50

'We're very careful to do education around Ebola — symptoms, how (Ebola) is spread.

'We review activities, contacts. Every little detail helps us pin down a person's risk level.'

Initially the investigators determine whether the contact did interact with Duncan and, if so, whether they are at risk for developing Ebola.

Then they need to assess the health of the individual and look for Ebola-like symptoms.

Karowski says the list of people who are considered at-risk now stands at about 50.

Nine of those are considered high-risk.

'By identifying contacts early on and following them for a 21-day period, we interrupt the chain of transmission, and that's the most effective strategy,' Karwowski told The Post.

On Thursday, the Dallas County's public health department said more than 80 people had been exposed to Ebola, via Duncan, in some way.

The department said 12 to 18 people came into direct contact with the Ebola patient and the rest came into contact with members of that group.

They are all being monitored and no one has shown any symptoms, said Erikka Neroes, a spokeswoman for the Dallas County Department of Health and Human Services.

The Texas Department of State Health Services said separately it was working from a list of about 100 potential or possible contacts and will soon have an official contact tracing number that will be lower.

'Out of an abundance of caution, we're starting with this very wide net, including people who have had even brief encounters with the patient or the patient's home,' said Carrie Williams, a spokeswoman with the Texas Department of State Health Services.
