Michael Dawson believes his former club Tottenham will reap the rewards for showing patience and sticking with beleaguered manager Maurico Pochettino, the man who sold Dawson to Hull in the summer.

Tottenham have shown little sign of shaking off what many perceived to be early season rustiness and a 2-1 home loss to Stoke before the international break has left fans wondering if there is a deep-rooted problem behind their five defeats in 11 league games.

But while Dawson will look to inflict further misery upon his former club when they meet on Sunday, he believes Pochettino will eventually propel Spurs up the table once the team is familiar with his high-intensity pressing style of play.

'They have to be patient,' Dawson told The Daily Express. 'It takes time when you bring in a manager and he brings different players in. He will have a different style of football.

'There are high expectations at Spurs and it comes with a lot of pressure. You have to be able to live that.' 

Dawson, who made over 300 appearances in almost ten years at White Hart Lane, said he accepts Pochettino's decision to sell him in the summer, and has enjoyed his time at Hull so far.

'It was made clear I would not play as much football as I would like under Pochettino,' Dawson explained. 

'When the chance came to come to Hull and I could see what they were building last year and with getting to the cup final, I was delighted.'
