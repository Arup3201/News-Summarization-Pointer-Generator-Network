Sleek, expensive and undoubtedly the apple of its owner's eye.

But this sports car, valued at around £300,000, could be smashed to smithereeens as it could be sent to the crusher after it was seized by police.

The Lamborghini Aventador was seized on Wilton Place in Knightsbridge for being driven illegally on London’s streets without insurance.

The purple high-performance machine is currently on display outside New Scotland Yard, with police considering whether charges will be brought against the driver.

And the car could yet find itself suffering a similar fate to the scores of old bangers already seized by police - crushed.

A Met Police spokesman said the Lamborghini was one a several supercars taken by officers as part of its Operation Cubo.

He said: 'We have been seizing many types of cars, but sports cars have been among them.

A total of 10,318 vehicles have been seized as part of Operation Cubo since October 2011

'We have had a few Porsaches, BMW X5s, and a Ferrari - that one got crushed and in fact the vast majority of them are.'

Operation Cubo has so far taken place on 20 separate days, with 656 vehicles seized one day last month.

The force said 135 arrests were made on this occasion for offences including robbery, drugs supply, metal theft, weapon-related offences and for being wanted offenders.

A total of 10,318 vehicles have been seized as part of Operation Cubo since October 2011.
