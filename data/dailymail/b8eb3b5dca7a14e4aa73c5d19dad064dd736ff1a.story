From two young boys posing with guns to a baby lying on an ISIS flag surrounded by weapons, these images show the children dubbed the jihadists of the future.

The shocking photos, which have been posted on social media sites accompanied by chilling messages, were taken by the youngsters' parents and other militants in Syria and Iraq.

They include children pointing assault rifles toward the sky, giving the Islamic State's one-finger salute and being indoctrinated in the ways of the extremist group.

Shocking: This photo, showing two young boys pointing assault rifles toward the sky, was posted on the social networking site Twitter. Its accompanying message reads 'Two young mujahideen for ISIS; not only than 14'

Salute: The photos were taken by the youngsters' parents and other militants in Syria and Iraq; a number of whom are believed to be British fighters. Above, another youngster gives the Islamic State's one-finger salute

Concerning: In this image (left), posted by Twitter user Abu Farris, a boy appears to operate a machine gun mounted on the back of a truck. Right, a younger child is held by a man with a weapon slung over his shoulder

Alarmingly, a number of the images appear to have been uploaded by British fighters who have travelled to the war-torn countries to wage jihad.

One Twitter user, who goes by the name Abu Farris, posted a picture of a child in a balaclava appearing to operate a machine gun mounted on the back of a truck.

The accompanying message reads: 'Abul Farooq 7 yr old kid with his dad in dawlah. He's soooo cute!!'

Meanwhile, another fighter Abu Turaab has uploaded a photo of a toddler being held by a man with a machine gun slung over his shoulder.

Innocent: Arguably the most shocking image is one of a baby - who appears to be less than six months old - lying on its on back on the black flag now associated with the group terrorising the Middle East

'Junior jihadi': This young boy, pictured holding a massive gun, has been dubbed a 'future lion' on Twitter

Indoctrinated: This image (left), uploaded by Twitter user Abu Layth, depicts a child giving the ISIS salute, while another child is captured donning red-and-white patterned headwear (right) with a huge gun in the background

The jihadist, a Canadian who is believed to be in Syria, wrote: 'Lil Mahmoud rockin the turban hard.'

Another user, Ali Al Farsi, who uses the handle @KafirsNightmare and lists his location as Al Sham, a term for Syria, tweeted a picture of a teenage boy.

He wrote: 'Abu Alaa, 14 years old, did martyrdom operation, May Allah accept his jihad & give him the highest rank of Al Firdaws.'

And another recent image on Twitter shows two young boys clutching assault rifles, with one also pointing to the sky.

Education: This image, showing children being indoctrinated by militants, was captioned: '"Brainwashing" the kids, these kids love us no lie 2am & they sit with us, the next generation to defend tawheed'

'Orphanage': These innocent youngsters are members of a so-called 'ISIS orphanage' based in Mosul, Iraq

A message underneath states: 'Syria: two young mujahideen for ISIS; not older than 14: lol these cats were with me in training camp.'

Among the most shocking of the images is one of a baby - who appears to be less than six months old - lying on its on back on the black flag now associated with the group terrorising the Middle East.

Where 
other babies its age might have soft toys scattered around them, the 
child has been cynically positioned next to a Kalashnikov rifle, a 
pistol and hand grenades.

The
 baby in the image - which was posted on Twitter beneath the hashtag #IS
 - is believed to be youngest child yet used as part of the group's 
social media campaign.

Militants: The Islamic State has already taken over swathes of Syria and Iraq. Above, militants march in Syria

The photo caused a furious backlash online, with one user accusing the organisation of using 'babies as weapons to kill the innocent'.

It comes as David Cameron has said the Britain will not pay ransom for hostage David Haines, who was seized by IS militants in northern Syria in May last year.

On Tuesday, the 44-year-old father of two was shown kneeling in the sand wearing an orange jumpsuit on a video of the beheading of a U.S. hostage.

The Prime Minister, who is coming under 
growing pressure to unleash a military response, said Britain would use 
'everything we have in our armoury' to squeeze ISIS out of existence.
