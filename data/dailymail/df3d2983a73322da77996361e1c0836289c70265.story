With her Made In Chelsea partying days behind her Millie Mackintosh has been embracing the seriously healthy lifestyle with gusto… and reaping the benefits.

The 24-year-old star is looking better than ever thanks to an intense workout regime and super lean and green diet with plenty of juices and supplements.

And it appears Millie credits one particular magical potion for her dewy complexion. She's recently tweeting and sharing pictures on her Instagram account of bottles of Skinade sitting beside her perfectly balanced meals. 

Millie posted this 'barefaced selfie' with her Twitter followers, claiming her glow stems from drinking Skinade

The former Made In Chelsea star, who is now a serious health fanatic, also shared this snap of her ultra healthy meal with a bottle of Skinade on the side

Millie is a fan of sharing her meals, and various juices and healthy drinks, with her fans

TV presenter Laura Whitmore and designer to the stars Melissa Odabash have similarly praised Skinade on their social media accounts.

So what distinguishes it from the plethora of other supplements and health drinks on the market?

The 150ml drink claims to provide everything your skin needs to remain healthy from the inside, rather than from a cream or moisturiser.

Each bottle contains skin boosting ingredients including collagen, omega 3 and 6, vitamin C, the amino acid l-lysine and B complex vitamins, said to be at the same level as 9 tablets would provide.

Laura Whitmore apparently used Skinade to her through a day of shooting, posting this snap of a bottle against a table of make up

Designer Melissa Odabash is another fan of Skinade, posting this snap of four bottles lined up

And ultra-fit Millie, who has previously confessed she is ‘obsessed’ with exercise and even wears her workout clothes on her ‘day off’ from the gym, is probably also won over by the minimal 35 calories in each bottle.

But at £90 for a 30 day supply it will certainly put a dent into your monthly budget, and some experts argue that it will do no more for you than eating a healthy well balanced diet will or drinking more water in terms of the appearance of your skin. 

Beauty
expert Elsa McAlonan says: "I am cynical - but then have seen friends who
swear by collagen drinks and supplements and
have amazing glowing skin. But it could be down to a
number of factors - for healthy skin you need plenty of sleep, exercise, a good
diet, regular facials - plus drink plenty of water  - and follow a good
skincare regime, of course.'

And plastic and
reconstructive surgeon and skin cancer expert  Dr Marko Lens added:  'There is no scientific evidence that collagen oral supplements have any
effects on skin health and appearance at all.

'Furthermore, there is no
guarantee that oral collagen would be any more effective than any diet rich in
proteins (such as meat, cheese, eggs or beans) at restoring the collagen in
your skin.'
