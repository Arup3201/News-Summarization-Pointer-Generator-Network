Wigan have been urged not to appoint Malky Mackay as their new manager by local MP Lisa Nandy.

The former Cardiff City boss has emerged as a front-runner to replace Uwe Rosler, who was sacked by Wigan owner Dave Whelan on Thursday.

Sportsmail’s exclusive revelations surrounding the exchange of racist, homophobic and sexist texts and email messages by Mackay and former head of recruitment Iain Moody while at Cardiff have left some Wigan supporters threatening to stop attending games if the Scot is appointed.

Disgruntled fans — including at least one shareholder and long-term season-ticket holders — have emailed and written to Wigan stating they plan to boycott matches.

Nandy — MP for Wigan — wrote to Whelan having been contacted by a number of concerned constituents and Wigan fans.

She wrote: ‘Whoever is appointed will be an ambassador for this town and based on the work your club has done to tackle discrimination over the years I am confident you would seek to ensure that they share these values.

‘I am sure that Wigan Athletic would not appoint anyone without ensuring first that they have respect for other people, regardless of gender, sexuality, ethnicity or religion.’

However, Wigan issued a statement insisting they were not close to making any decision. It read: ‘Since (announcing the decision to axe Rosler) we have not discussed any individual or drawn up a short list, never mind actually contacting any potential candidates or their agents.

‘As such, I can categorically deny that any one candidate is ahead of any other as regards being appointed as the next manager of Wigan Athletic.’

Mackay, 42, is still under investigation by the FA, with disciplinary chiefs struggling with the issue over what is deemed private and public communication.

Show Racism the Red Card patron and ambassador Leroy Rosenior said: ‘I don’t understand how Malky Mackay can be considered for the Wigan job while still under investigation for sending racist and offensive messages.

‘Sadly, I am not surprised, as it has long been my view that football as a whole does not seem to believe that racism is a problem and chairmen are always more concerned with issues on the pitch than anything that happens off it.’

The Scottish boss was sacked as Cardiff manager last season and has yet to return to football

May 2010: Vincent Tan is the new owner of Cardiff City.

June 2011: After Dave Jones is sacked following a Championship play-off semi-final defeat, Malky Mackay is appointed manager.

February 2012: Mackay leads Cardiff to their first League Cup final, which they lose to Liverpool on penalties following a 2-2 draw after extra time.

May 2012: Cardiff lose in the play-off semi-final again, but Mackay retains his post.

Tan controversially decides that the club’s shirts should be changed from blue to red and the traditional bluebird emblem swapped for a dragon — causing huge unrest among the Cardiff supporters.

September 2012: Tan replaces the club’s chief executive, Alan Whiteley (left), with associate Simon Lim.

April 2013: Cardiff secure promotion to the Premier League, finishing top of the Championship.

August 2013: After around £35million is spent in preparation for life in the top flight, Tan publicly tells Mackay to ensure there is a positive return on his investment.

October 2013: Mackay’s head of recruitment, Iain Moody, with whom he had worked at Watford, is replaced by 23-year-old Kazakh Alisher Apsalyamov (right), reportedly on work experience, although he is unable to take the job on visa grounds.

December 16: Cardiff beat West Brom in the Premier League and Mackay suggests to the Press that he will need three players in the January transfer window. Lim releases a statement on behalf of Tan that criticises Mackay for his comments and asserts that he will not be given ‘a single penny’ for transfers.

December 19: Mackay is emailed by Tan, informing him to either resign from his position or be sacked.

December 22: Cardiff release a club statement that Mackay will remain as manager ‘for the foreseeable future’.

December 26: Cardiff lose 3-0 at home to Southampton, as fans stage a protest against Tan.

December 27: Mackay is eventually dismissed as Cardiff manager.
