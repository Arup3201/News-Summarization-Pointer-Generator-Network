Former soldier Christian Lewis and his daughter Caitlin, 11, had to live in their car for a month

Benefits bosses have apologised to a war veteran and his 11-year-old daughter who were forced to live in his car for a month after a payments blunder.

Christian Lewis, 32, and his daughter Caitlin found themselves homeless after they were denied housing benefits and other allowances they were entitled to.

Mr Lewis, who served with 2nd Battalion The Parachute Regiment, said he was evicted from his flat in Swansea after he failed to get Jobseeker’s Allowance and housing benefits.

He then spent a month living in his Volkswagen Bora along with his daughter.

Mr Lewis, who had moved back to Swansea from Northampton to be closer to his family, said: 'I struggled getting work in Swansea and I fell behind with my rent and we got evicted.

'We moved to another place but we had to move out because someone bought it.

'We were homeless for four weeks. I’m a single parent and I lived with my daughter in a car. It was a dire situation.'

He added: 'Those four weeks were tough on me and my daughter. We would go around our friends’ houses for as long as we could in the day.

'We would park on the road we used to live on in Edgemoor Close, Upper Killay.

'It was really hideous - it was horrible.'

Mr Lewis, who served in Macedonia and spent three years in Northern Ireland between 1997 and 2004, said staff at Caitlin’s old school, Dunvant Primary School, picked up on their problems and a support worker stepped in to help.

Swansea Council said it was never informed that Christian was living in a car and understood he was staying with friends.

The council said it had offered him temporary and permanent accommodation which he had turned down.

Red-faced: Benefits bosses have apologised for 'a deeply regrettable situation'

The Department of Work and Pensions has promised to pay his arrears in what it described as a 'deeply regrettable situation'.

A spokeswoman said: 'We can only offer our sincere apologies to Mr Lewis. We have reviewed his claim and paid him all the arrears of benefit due. This is a deeply regrettable situation.

'We owe the men and women who serve this country a huge debt of gratitude and are committed to doing everything we can to help them find work and get the benefits they are entitled to.'
