A milk rota in a Whitehall office was marked ‘restricted’ by mandarins obsessed with security and playing James Bond.

An official also landed in hot water for leaving a document marked ‘restricted’ on a printer, even though it was the only thing written on the sheet of paper.

Cabinet office minister Francis Maude said the farce had to end because Whitehall had failed to move with the times.

Sensitive: A document on what days different milk was bought for civil servants to make tea and coffee was marked 'restricted' by over-zealous security officials

Now the Government's security classifications are to be dramatically streamlined in a bid to improve communication and save millions of pounds.

In future all documents will be either top secret, secret or official - after ministers condemned the old six-tier system as a Cold War relic.

Mr Maude ordered the shake-up after learning that a document detailing on what days full fat, semi-skimmed and skimmed milk was bought for civil servants to make tea and coffee was marked 'restricted' by over-zealous security officials

He also found emails could not be sent between the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defence because their servers worked on different security levels. Instead, staff had to run between the buildings with printouts.

The old markings of unclassified, protected, restricted and confidential are being merged into a new ‘official’ band.  Secret and top secret will remain in place.

Spooks: Ministers said the view of spies like James Bond, pictured, passing top secret documents around Whitehall had not moved with the times

Mr Maude said: ‘Most people’s image of government security classifications is of M sliding Bond a buff-coloured folder stamped TOP SECRET.

‘But where Bond’s cutting-edge gadgets and cars have moved with the times, our security processes are beginning to show their age.

‘The existing system is confusing and often misapplied.

‘When I heard that a milk rota had been marked as “Restricted” I knew things had to change,’ he wrote in The Independent.

‘One of my team even got in trouble for leaving a document marked “Restricted” on the printer – even though it was otherwise entirely blank.’

Farce: Cabinet Office Francis Maude said he was dismayed at the way blank or innocuous documents were treated as secret

Most staff will now be issued with ‘off the shelf’ computers and mobile devices - such as those used by hospitals - rather than more specialist kit.

A laptop with government encryption costs around £7,000 a year to run, whereas in future one to deal with ‘official’ documents could cost £1,000.

A Cabinet Office source said the reforms were expected to save ‘many millions of pounds’.

More than 700,000 civil servants and military personnel will begin using the new markings from April, with the rest of the public sector following  later.

Mr Maude is understood to have handed back his top-security government computer and mobile equipment, and now uses devices with lower encryption.

For documents that require a higher level of protection, he apparently only has paper copies.

Mr Maude added: ‘Whitehall uses a security classification system designed decades ago.

‘We are changing that and introducing a new system fit for the digital age. It will speed up decisions, make it easier to share information and save hard-working taxpayers' money.

‘There has been a tendency to over mark documents rather than to manage risk properly.

‘This can devalue the basic security principles.

‘We think the most important and sensitive materials should be protected as 'Top Secret' or 'Secret' but for other information the new 'Official' category, with its renewed emphasis upon personal responsibility and accountability, will be appropriate for most of what government does.’
