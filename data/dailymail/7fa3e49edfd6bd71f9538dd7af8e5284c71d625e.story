The mother who died, along with her three children after a fatal car crash,  may have been speeding at 160km/h while driving under the influence of drugs, an investigation has found.

Keisha Ann Jackson, from Wurtulla on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland, had been driving along Glenview Road with her four children on August 22 when her car slid off the wet road and slammed into a tree.

The results of the toxicology  show the 30-year-old had cannabis in her system, which police believe would have affected her ability to drive, according to the Courier Mail. 

The preliminary results estimated the mother had driven between 130km/h and 160km/h  in a 80km/h zone at night.

Krystal Percival may have been speeding at 160km/h while driving under the influence of drugs, an investigation has found

Four children, Matilda, Ethan, Ryan and Joan, were in the car when it crashed in Queensland on August 22. Ethan, 11, is the only child who has survived the accident

Acting Sergeant Duncan Hale, from the Sunshine Coast Forensic Crash Unit, told Courier Mail that Ms Jackson’s blood samples found cannabis in her system.

'Analysis results have shown that at the time of the crash she had cannabis in her blood at a level that would have had an affect on her ability to safely control a vehicle,' he said.

Sergeant Hale said an investigation of the road's sweeping curve and the wet conditions revealed the car was travelling at least 130km/h.

'It appears to have been a loss of control due to excessive speed,' he told the Courier Mail.

Ms Jackson died at the scene alongside her son Ryan Jackson-Cooke, 10, and her daughter Joan Jackson, seven, according to Queensland Police.

Matilda Jackson-Cooke, four, died overnight after being in a critical condition at Royal Brisbane Hospital since the accident. 

Ryan and four-year-old Matilda were found in the grass nearby and appeared to have been thrown from the vehicle upon impact.

Two of Ms Jackson's children died at the scene. Her oldest son Ethan, 11, managed to escape with only minor injuries while her youngest child, Matilda, 4, died in hospital

In the wake of the tragic incident, Ms Jackson's best friend, Krystal Percival, told the Sunday Mail that Ms Jackson had expressed grave concern about driving along the very road she died on.

'She told me "One of these days I’m going to die on this corner",' Ms Percival, 27, said.

Since news of the accident spread, family and friends have expressed their shock over the incident.

'I wished this has never happened to you I hope I will see you in the next life in the spirit world and your kids as well. You will always be in my heart for ever,' Amanda Lando wrote on Facebook.

Ms Jackson's eldest child, 11-year-old Ethan Jackson miraculously managed to survive the crash. He only sustained minor injuries according to police, and was discharged from hospital.

The 11-year-old managed to escape the wreck after the accident and flag down a car that was passing by, Verena Hart, an aged care nurse who had been passing by at the time, told the Northern Star.

'He was covered in blood and grass and mud, he was all dazed and confused,' she said.

Ms Hart, Ethan and a policeman that he’d managed to flag down, then went to find the wreckage together in the dark.

They discovered seven-year-old Joan, caught in her seat belt and barely breathing at the scene that Ms Hart described as appearing 'like a bomb had gone off'.

She was unable to be saved by paramedics and died at the scene.

Forensic investigators are still looking into the incident, and are considering the issues of speed and seatbelts.

Acting Superintendent John Boznjak said told Sunshine Coast Daily: 'It appears that speed might be a factor.

There are several factors we are looking at, particularly speed, they are awaiting toxicology reports which will take some time to establish if there is anything in that regard to look at.'
