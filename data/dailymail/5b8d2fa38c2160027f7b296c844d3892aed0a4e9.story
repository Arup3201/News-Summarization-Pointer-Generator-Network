Given that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge appeared a little fuzzy in their first official portraits with Prince George, you could have been forgiven for not noticing Kate’s outfit.

But it seems Michael Middleton’s less than professional photography skills didn’t stop plenty of women from admiring her dress - and rushing out to buy it.

Maternity brand Seraphine’s £46 Jolene knotted-front dress in fuchsia sold out just 48 hours after the photos were published - more than the brand would normally sell in two months.

It has sparked predictions that turnover at the small London-based company will soar by 50 per cent, from £5.2million in the year to the end of March to £8million in the current financial year.

Throughout her pregnancy, Kate has been seen in a number of Seraphine’s modestly priced maternity wear dresses, including the £50 Blossom knotted front lavender dress and the £39 black butterfly sleeve dress.

However, she is not alone among celebrity mothers to have worn the London firm’s range, for other fans include actresses Jessica Alba, Angelina Jolie, Kate Hudson, Halle Berry and Sienna Miller.

Such is the demand for the Jolene dress around the world that one US company has decided to feature it in a range of maternity clothes that are available to rent.

The Duchess’s liking for high street 
brands, such as Reiss, Zara and Whistles, have previously had a 
remarkable impact on sales, dubbed the ‘Kate effect’.

'The "Kate effect" has proved time and time again to be a powerful force in fashion'

Cecile Reinaud, Seraphine

For example, a £175 bandage dress from 
Reiss quickly sold out after she wore it for a first meeting with 
President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle.

Company founder Cecile Reinaud said: ‘The “Kate effect” has proved time and time again to be a powerful force in fashion.

‘Young women want to emulate her elegant style, and when she chooses pieces from accessible high street brands over expensive designer labels, this desire becomes attainable.’
