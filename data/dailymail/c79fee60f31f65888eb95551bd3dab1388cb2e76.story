Mauricio Pochettino has defended Christian Eriksen after Denmark manager Morten Olsen tore into the Tottenham midfielder for his contribution in their Euro 2016 qualifying defeat by Portugal.

Olsen singled out Eriksen for scathing criticism after Denmark’s 1-0 loss on Tuesday, claiming he failed to take control of the game and indicating that he has not developed since leaving Ajax 14 months ago.

But Tottenham manager Pochettino insisted Eriksen is still improving, saying: ‘It’s not my problem. It’s his (Olsen’s) problem. My problem is to look after my player Christian Eriksen. I am very happy with his performance and commitment.

‘I can only say we are happy with Christian. He is a very good professional and his commitment with the team and the club is good.’

Eriksen scored 10 goals in his first season at Spurs following an £11million move from Ajax in 2013 and netted the winner against Southampton before the international break.

Pochettino added: ‘He is a very good player, important for Tottenham. I am very happy for his performance and impact on the club and team.

‘He is still young. He knows he needs to improve but we are very happy with him. We expect that Christian is happy with us and can still improve.’

Olsen was furious with Eriksen after Cristiano Ronaldo’s stoppage time winner. He said: ‘It is a brutal world, otherwise you have to play at another level. It is not Ajax any more, this is not development. After so many matches he could pick up the ball and help to control the game. He has not been able to. Therefore, we blame him.’

Pochettino will find out on Friday whether Hugo Lloris will be fit for this weekend's clash against Manchester City — the side that put 11 goals past him last season.

The France goalkeeper pulled out of his country’s 3-0 friendly win over Armenia on Tuesday because of a thigh problem, with Michel Vorm primed to step in to face City.

Nacer Chadli is also a doubt after missing Belgium’s clash with Bosnia and Herzegovina on Monday with a hip problem.

The champions could also be depleted, with midfielder Yaya Toure a doubt for the Etihad Stadium clash.
