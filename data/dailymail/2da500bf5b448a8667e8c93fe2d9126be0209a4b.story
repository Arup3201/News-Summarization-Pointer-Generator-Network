A Ryanair flight to Dublin was diverted to Denmark after a ‘drunk’ man stripped semi-naked and had to be tackled by fellow passengers after he started throwing punches.

The flight was on its way to Ireland from Riga in Latvia on Tuesday night when the man removed his shirt and began flexing his muscles at the plane’s rear.

The plane was forced to make the unscheduled landing at Aarhus Airport in Tirstrup, Denmark and the man was arrested.

The Ryanair flight was diverted to Denmark after a drunk man removed his shirt and began throwing punches

The plane was on its way to Dublin from Latvian capital Riga on Tuesday when the man caused a disturbance

He was recorded causing a disturbance and was eventually ‘subdued and tied up’ by other passengers, the Copenhagen Post reported.

Peter Hallstrøm from East Jutland Police said: 'A plane was diverted because of a drunk person, so we had to arrest him.

‘He was uneasy on board the aircraft, and the staff could not handle him.’

He added the man was ‘outspoken and provocative’ on the flight but was not violent towards anyone.

Mr Hallstrøm added the man did not resist arrest and spent the night sobering up in a police cell. It is not known if he will face any charges.

He was recorded removing his shirt at the back of the plane and he then began throwing punches at the walls

A Ryanair spokesman told MailOnline: 'This flight from Riga to Dublin (10 Feb) diverted into Aarhus after a passenger became disruptive in-flight. 

'On arrival, police removed (and detained) this passenger before the aircraft departed to Dublin. 

'We are fully assisting the police with their investigations and the individual has been banned from travelling on our airline. 

'We will not tolerate unruly or disruptive behaviour at any time and we sincerely apologised to other customers for any inconvenience caused. 

'The safety and comfort of our customers, crew and aircraft is our number one priority.'
