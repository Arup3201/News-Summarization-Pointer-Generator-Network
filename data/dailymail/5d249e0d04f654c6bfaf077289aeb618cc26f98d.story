Dave Hockaday, the former manager of Forest Green Rovers, is poised to become the new head coach of Leeds United.

The 56-year-old was a right-back with Blackpool and Swindon and spent four years as boss of Conference side Forest Green before leaving by mutual consent last October after losing seven out of eight league games.

Owner Massimo Cellino faced an angry reaction from fans last night who were expecting a name such as Gary McAllister but Cellino is expected to confirm the appointment on Wednesday.

Shock: Hockoday is the former Forest Green manager, but has been handed a two-year deal at Elland Road

Hockaday was a right back for Blackpool, Hull City, Shrewsbury Town, Stoke City and Swindon Town.

His coaching credentials included working as Watfordâ€™s assistant manager as a coach for Southampton and Leicester.
