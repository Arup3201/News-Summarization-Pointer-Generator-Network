And so, at last, the voice of reason. Last week, researchers from Stanford University published the results of the most comprehensive study to date on organic and conventional foods.

Their conclusion? Organic foods have no more vitamins and nutrients than  traditionally grown produce.

I can’t say I’m surprised. Chicken is chicken, with the same nutritional content, whether it is organic, free range or mass-produced. But now  scientists have confirmed it, perhaps we can begin to have a proper conversation about the food we put on our table.

Marco Pierre-White expresses his relief that scientific evidence has revealed no nutritional or safety benefits of organic food over non-organic

The Stanford University team reviewed more than 200 studies which compared either the health of those who ate organic and conventional foods, or, more commonly, nutrient and contaminant levels in the foods themselves.

It included organic and non-organic fruits, vegetables, grains, meat, poultry, eggs and milk.

Not only did the researchers discover organic food is not more nutritious, they also found that, although conventional foods contained more  pesticides, these chemicals were well within permitted limits and not harmful in any way.

In one fell swoop they have demolished the two supposedly incontrovertible arguments of the organic lobby – that their produce has more nutrients and is much safer.

Whether this will be enough to stop the juggernaut remains to be seen but it’s a start. For too long there has been an unbearable smugness about the ‘organic’ mob – for that is what it is. 

In certain sections of society, mothers who fail to feed their young organic baby food are looked on with horror. Then there are the chefs who tell us that eating anything less than organic is somehow immoral.

I’m sorry but I don’t buy into the Jamie Olivers and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstalls of this world. Sometimes I wonder is there no escape from this pair of over-seasoned, organically correct pancake-tossers. We’d prefer it if their appearances on TV and in our bookshops were medium rare, but they’re not. They are distinctly over-done.

For imagine if the entire industry 
were to go organic or free range? We’d never be able to feed ourselves. 
What would the price of bread be? Of eggs? And if all eggs were free 
range what would happen to the price of biscuits or Hellmann’s 
mayonnaise?

Don’t tell me these people haven’t all sat around the 
business table and eaten those very same biscuits with a cup of tea. 

It’s
all well and good these campaigners getting on their high horse with 
all their ideals but it has absolutely nothing to do with reality. I 
don’t like to preach to people.

Marco Pierre White defends his backing of food producer Bernard Matthews, which sells wafer thin, value-for-money, Turkey ham slices

Take McDonald’s. If I’m driving down the road and my daughter is tired and hungry,  and it’s gridlocked, what’s wrong with pulling into the forecourt and buying her a box of six chicken McNuggets and a milkshake?

If my industry wants to attack me for my views then so be it but I’d rather go into a McDonald’s, pay my money and know what I’m getting than go to a lot of fancy restaurants that all too often offer so much and deliver too little.

I’d rather spend 99p on a cheeseburger than £20 on some main course that doesn’t deliver. It’s all about value for money.

And how many restaurants serve organic or free range? Are the bones they use for their stock from animals raised on organic farms? Are their sauces made from organic tomatoes?

Of course not. Restaurants simply don’t do organic because they can’t justify the price. 

That is the point. If they banned industrial farming, chicken would become a luxury item. The idea that something as simple – and nutritious – as a chicken should be denied to families on a lower income is frankly appalling. If it wasn’t for commercial farming there wouldn’t be Sunday lunch for millions of families.

If you go down to the supermarket and go to the fish counter, how often is the sea bass farmed, the prawns, the salmon, the trout? And there is nothing wrong with that if it is done well. 

The same goes for meat. It takes the pressure off the wild stock and means the average person can eat well.

Marco has little time for 'snobs' who only buy organic food and those who only shop at more pricey stores such as Waitrose

That’s what farming does – it makes food available to everyone.

I come from humble beginnings, growing up, one of four boys, on a Leeds council estate. We always ate well because my grandfather and father were both chefs.

A journalist once asked me, ‘What was it like growing up poor on tinned food?’ We couldn’t afford tinned food, I hankered after it. When I endorsed Bernard Matthews I was castigated by all and sundry but if it wasn’t for him, we wouldn’t have had turkey on the table at Christmas.

A proper meal enriches family life. I would rather have dinner cooked with love – preferably by someone who can cook – than some dried-up old piece of organic chicken.

There are certain people who wouldn’t be seen dead in any other supermarket than Waitrose. I abhor that kind of snobbery. Not everyone can afford organic so stop bullying them, stop patronising them, stop dictating to them. And as we now know, it’s not even worth the extra cost.

I’ll go further. In some instances, I would argue that non-organic food can be better for you. For example, regular pork loin steak has 6.2g of fat per 80g, while the organic equivalent has 21.4g. Yet we all know that too much fat is bad for us.

What’s important is that rich or poor, organic or mass-produced, you are getting the same vitamins.

In a strange way, I am more in favour of mass-produced farming than the organic movement. I look at organic as a label, nothing more. And a very expensive one at that.

Three out of four households buy organic food, with the market worth more than £1 billion a year. I have a theory that people who aren’t very good cooks buy organic to compensate.

Sales of organic food in the UK are the second highest in Europe and at a time when food prices are sky-rocketing. Consumers have seen the price of their weekly food shop increase by 6.4 per cent over the past year, double the EU average.

The only thing that should dictate your choice is your palate and your pocket. When I go to the butcher or the grocer I buy what looks good.

Provenance is important to me. Would I prefer to have my pork chop locally sourced from a small farmer? Yes. If you can afford to buy pork or beef or lamb reared by an independent farmer, that’s great. You are lucky.

But don’t criticise and patronise the people who can’t. Thanks to this report all those, like me, who have never believed the organic hype, don’t have to listen to their dogma any longer.
