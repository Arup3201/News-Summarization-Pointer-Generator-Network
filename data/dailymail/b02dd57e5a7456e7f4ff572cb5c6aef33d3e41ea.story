Sydney siege gunman Man Haron Monis became more frightening and violent as he got deeper into 'his Islamic studies' and at one point displayed such scary behaviour that his mother-in-law realised for the first time just how 'dangerous' he was.

In a court appearance just over a year before she was murdered in a brutal killing which Monis was alleged to have plotted, his late wife Noleen Hayson Pal revealed how he became more and more paranoid as his Islamic activities increased.

Court documents reveal Monis, who was practising as a 'psychic ... [who] could predict the future' and was unable to control his anger.

Sydney siege gunman Man Haron Monis became more frightening and violent as he got deeper into 'his Islamic studies' and at one point displayed such scary behaviour that his mother-in-law realised for the first time just how 'dangerous' he was

It was 11am on August 22, 2009, the Saturday of the Ramadan religious festival and Monis, who went by the name of Michael Hayson at the time, was in the backyard of locksmith Ashouk and his wife Marian Pal's Green Valley home in south-western Sydney.

The Pal family are Muslims.

He was 45 years old and had been in a de facto relationship with Noleen Hayson Pal, 26.

The Pal family was preparing to visit family and friends as is customary at Ramadan, but Monis did not want Ms Pal to go out.

The couple lived in a granny flat in he garden of the Green Valley home and Mrs Pal had already noticed how he often argued with her daughter.

On Ramadan Saturday 2009, Hayson 'started to argue [with my daughter]'.

'She wanted to go out with me to visit our relatives. You know we go places during Ramadan,' Mrs Pal told Downing Centre Court during an domestic violence order application and hearing for a charge against Monis of intimidation and stalking in January 2012.

'He liked to cause trouble between our friends and family, like telling us to stay away from these people, they're not good enough.

In 2009 Monis was in a defacto relationship with Noleen Hayson Pal

In a court appearance just over a year before she was murdered in a brutal killing which Monis was alleged to have plotted, his late wife Ms Pal revealed how he became more and more paranoid as his Islamic activities increased

'That day he created so much problem... He was showing his true colours.

'He started to argue and then ... he was out of his sense ... like he was banging his head with his hand.

'He was very angry and my daughter was pleading with him "I want to go and visit Mum's friends".'

Mrs Pal said Monis was banging his head forcibly and 'that day I really saw him how ... arrogant and dangerous he was'.

But it would be another two years before Noleen Pal threw Monis out of the granny flat, an act which would unleash a violent tirade of death threats and revenge.

Ms Pal told Campbelltown Court she had met Monis as Michael Hayson in early 2003 when she answered his newspaper advertisement as a 'psychic' and she made an appointment.

She said Monis was selling his services for 'like where he can tell the future and stuff'.

They began a relationship which she said the began to break down in 2006 because he was 'too busy doing his own stuff ... he was taking a lot more time out for his Islamic activities.

In October last year, Man Haron Monis was charged with accessory before and after the fact of Ms Pal's murder and his girlfriend, Amirah Droudis (pictured) was charged with murder

Ms Pal told a court he tried to hit her, but her mother Mrs Pal intervened

'He wasn't hardly coming home ... financially he wasn't supporting me, as well. He wasn't supportive. He didn't care. 

She said she didn't report it to police because 'I was scared ... that if I did ... he would do something even worse'.

She said Monis had also tried to hit her, but her mother had intervened.

Despite the deterioration of their relationship, Monis continued to visit Ms Pal and stay in the granny flat two days a week.

She said during this time he became more and more paranoid as he got into his Islamic activities 'Every time he's come to my house, he's been very paranoid,' she told the court.

'As soon as he walks into the house, the doors have to be closed, the blinds have to be drawn, we can't go outside.

Monis reportedly became very paranoid as he got deeper into his Islamic studies and Ms Pal feared if she moved out with him he would control her

'He's always saying to me that people are watching, people are hearing our conversations, especially when he started getting more into his Islamic activities, running the websites.'

She said he came and went 'randomly, whenever he pleased' until finally, on June 18, 2011, she told him to take all his things and not come over again.

'He was shocked, surprised and said "Are you sure?". I did see his face change. He became, like angry.

'I was worried he could just attack me, like become violent in that moment.' 

She said she was frightened and over the next week when he came back almost every day to collect his belongings, she 'avoided talking to him ... because I didn't want to start any more arguments or get him angry towards me.

'Like when I do start up with conversations he, instead of talking calmly, he starts getting angry.' 

Monis then started pleading with Ms Pal to move out of her parents' property and to go and live with him, which she resisted.

Mrs Pal told the court of many instances where she realised just how dangerous Monis was, fearing for the wellbeing of her daughter

'I knew if I move out with him he'll start controlling me. He'll start doing you know whatever he wanted with me.' 

At around 9pm on July 20, 2011 he demanded an 'urgent' meeting in person with her at McDonalds in Hinchinbrook, near her parents' home.

Ms Pal's parents would not let her go alone and drove her in her car  to the fast food outlet, and waited in the car as Monis tried to draw Ms Pal into the darkest area of the McDonalds car park.

Mrs and Mrs Pal watched their daughter arguing with Monis, noting his 'angry face'.

Ms Pal said after several minutes of talking, he said to her in a loud angry voice, '... you're going to pay, even if I have to shoot you.'

Ms Pal returned shaking and terrified to her family in the car and drove home.

Her mother told the court that following the encounter her daughter had been 'very upset, nervous ... frightened at the same time ... because I think she knows how dangerous Michael is.'

Monis' ex-wife told of her fear of going to police worried that her husband would commit more serious violence against her

Monis was arrested a week later and in a long, rambling interview he gave at St Mary's Police station, he flatly denied the threat saying 'I swear to God, I swear to God is lie, absolutely a lie. I swear to God it's a lie.'

The court hearing was adjourned twice and on May 30, 2012, Man Haron Monis aka Mohammad Hassan Mengheti was found not guilty of stalking and intimidation of Noleen Hayson Pal.

Just under 12 months later Ms Pal was dead, following a brutal attack after she was lured to the Werrington apartment where Monis was living in western Sydney on a Sunday afternoon, April 2, 2013.

Attacked in the stairwell by a 'woman in a black cape', Ms Pal was stabbed 18 times, doused with accelerant and then set alight as horrified neighbours watched on.

In October last year, Man Haron Monis was charged with accessory before and after the fact of Ms Pal's murder and his girlfriend, Amirah Droudis was charged with murder.

On December 12, both were released on bail to await trial.
