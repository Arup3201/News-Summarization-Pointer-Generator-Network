A killer posted an RIP message about her victim on facebook just days after she and her gang tortured him to death.

Georgina Smith, 22, pretended to be in mourning for 30-year-old Scott Blackwood, writing that he had 'always been a good mate' and even vowing to make sure his killers went to jail.

In fact she and two others, Allan Nicol, 36, and Thomas Moore, 26, had killed Mr Blackwood just four days before by kicking, punching, biting and stabbing him to death.

Jailed: Georgina Smith, 22, posted an RIP message on Scott Blackwood's Facebook page just four days after helping to torture the vulnerable man to death

Fake condolence: In the message she posted on Facebook, Georgina Smith called Mr Blackwood her 'best mate' and even vowed to see his killers jailed

He suffered 72 separate injuries including scalds and chemical burns. He
 had 13 stabs wounds, three broken ribs, smashed eye socket and 
cheekbones and he was strangled.

Pathologist Dr Julie McAdam said the head injuries found on Mr Blackwood were like those suffered by car crash victims.

Yesterday Nicol and Moore were found guilty of murdering Mr Blackwood in Saltcoats, Ayrshire, on July 3 or 4 last year. Both were sentenced to life imprisonment and ordered to serve at least 20 years each.

Judge Lord McEwan said: ‘This was a scandalous, disgraceful and horrific attack on a young man, including what amounted to torture.’

Smith, 22, was convicted of the lesser charge of culpable homicide following a five-week trial at the High Court in Glasgow.

Witness Sean Sinclair, 21, said he went to Nicol’s home on the night of the horror and discovered a badly beaten Mr Blackwood. He said Moore stood over Scott armed with metal pole covered in blood.

In a police interview he added: ‘Tommy hit Scott with the barbell. Alan started laying into Scott on the side of the legs. Georgie was shouting “finish him, finish him”.’

Nicol then began 'panicking' about the amount of blood in his house, so the attackers decided to drag Mr Blackwood two doors down the street to his own home where they continued the attack.

Sinclair added in the interview: 'Scott could not stand, so he could have already been dead.'

Sinclair recalled Scott falling down stairs and Nicol claiming he 'deserved' it.

Scott was then hauled back upstairs before being tied to a bath and his ankles bound together with a dog lead.

In the interview, Sinclair told police: 'Georgie then got a bottle of turps [solvent] and when she came back, she poured it all over him.

'She tried to set him on fire using a lighter - but I stopped her because it was not happening.'

The jury heard Moore again yelled that Scott 'f****** deserved it' and that Smith 'was agreeing'.

Moore claimed he would take the rap as Smith was pregnant - though this turned out to be a lie.

In a police interview Smith said the incident was sparked by Moore hitting Scott on the nose with a metal bar.

She said: 'I could hear the sound of bone crunching and Allan was shouting at Scott: "Lick your blood..."

'Scott was shaking and crying. Allan stamped on his face. Part of his ear was bitten off.'

After Blackwood was dead, his killers went back to Nicol's house and washed their blood-stained clothes in a bid to escape justice.

Nicol and Moore showed no emotion as they was lead away to the cells. Smith will be sentenced next month.
