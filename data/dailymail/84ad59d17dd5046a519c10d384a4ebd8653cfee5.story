Plans for a national flagship were hailed yesterday as a demonstration that Britain still has a ‘lust for adventure’, as they gathered growing support from senior ministers.

The proposal for a privately-funded vessel to represent the nation around the world won the backing of Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, Education Secretary Michael Gove and Business Secretary Vince Cable.

The Daily Mail revealed yesterday that David Cameron and Ed Miliband were supporting a fundraising campaign for a ship that will act as both an ambassador for UK trade and a ‘university of the seas’, providing maritime education opportunities for young people.

Crucially, the 650ft, four-masted UK 
Flagship will not be funded by taxpayers’ money, instead drawing on 
donations from businesses, philanthropists and the public.

Mr Clegg said: ‘This is directly in line with Britain’s proud naval tradition which stretches back hundreds of years. Our country has always been at the 
forefront of trade, exploration and scientific research and the UK 
Flagship can help us to continue to be so.

‘I am particularly pleased that the 
vessel will provide such brilliant opportunities for our young people. 
Lots of youngsters will be given a unique chance to learn first-hand 
about both the marine world and life on the ocean waves. The UK Flagship
will also be riding the waves for British business, travelling the 
globe promoting the best of UK PLC and creating jobs back here.

‘The UK Flagship is not going to be 
paid for by the taxpayer but by the generosity of those contributing to a
charitable trust, which will also operate it. It is fantastic that the 
country will be able to enjoy such a magnificent ship without spending 
public money.’

Education Secretary Mr Gove said: ‘The
idea of a national flagship, designed to showcase the best of British 
innovation, support scientific exploration and give young people a 
wonderful training opportunity is more than inspired – it’s 
inspirational.

‘Instead of national hand-wringing and
negativity, we need to remind ourselves that our nation, our engineers,
our scientists and above all our young people are worth boasting about.

‘This ship will embody the spirit of 
unapologetic national pride which characterised our Jubilee celebrations
and demonstrate that Britons still have hearts of oak and a lust for 
adventure.’

Mr Cable said the UK Flagship would 
help fly the flag for British business around the world. The Royal Yacht
Britannia, decommissioned in 1997, was used for many trade deals. For 
example contracts worth in excess of £1billion were signed on board 
during a visit to India in 1993.

‘This builds on our country’s great 
maritime tradition and will be a fantastic way for young people to 
develop skills at sea,’ the Business Secretary said.

‘It’s also a great platform for export
promotion which is so vital in continuing to lift the UK out of the 
deep economic troubles it has suffered.

‘Great credit is due to the Daily Mail
for supporting this campaign, as well as those who have so generously 
donated to make this fantastic project possible.’

Organisers hope the vessel, to be 
constructed in Britain, will take to the seas in 2016. It will 
accommodate up to 200 youngsters engaged in maritime training and 
science projects, and will also have apartments for use by VIPs on 
official occasions.

Despite comparisons with Britannia, 
the new vessel will have no royal designation and will not be crewed by 
the armed forces or draw on taxpayers’ money for its running costs.

Conservative peer Lord Ashcroft, who 
has pledged up to £5million to the charitable trust behind the project, 
said: ‘The possibilities open to us are hugely exciting and they can 
prepare people – particularly the young –for the future challenges they 
will face in society.’

Donations to The UK Flagship can be made through www.ukflagship.com or via HSBC, 69 Pall Mall, London, SW1Y 5EY.
