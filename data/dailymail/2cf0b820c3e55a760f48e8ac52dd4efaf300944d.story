It is the time of year again when the already toned Victoria's Secret Angels begin to fine tune their near flawless physiques in the run up to the brand's highly anticipated catwalk show.

And, just like the previous two years, they have released a series of workout videos, aptly called 'Train like an Angel', revealing their fitness secrets.

In the trailer for this years set of short films, released today on the Victoria's Secret YouTube channel, we get a sneak peek of the workouts used by Adrina Lima, Alessandra Ambrosio and Candice Swanepoel.

From boxing to ballet, the exercises used by the Amazonian models are flashed before us in quick succession, giving us just a glimpse of their impeccable bodies in the latest season of Victoria's Secret sportswear.

In the two videos already released by the American lingerie brand on their website, we see Angel Adriana Lima with trainer Michael Olajide demonstrating her core workout and Candice Swanepoel showing her full-body workout with Ballet Beautiful’s Mary Helen Bowers.

Adriana, in matching leggings and crop top, shows how she uses a simple bar to work out her core muscles alongside circuits involving moving between a plank and crunch position and 'V' crunches. 

Candice's all-over workout is based on ballet moves.

Candice's all-over workout is based on ballet moves that aim to achieve a lean dancers' body 

Looking tanned and without an ounce of fat in a cropped yellow workout bra, patterned leggings and black ballet shoes, Candice is led through a series of movements using ballet arm positions to achieve a lean dancers' body. 

Her workout also includes arabesque-type leg extensions which involve lifting one leg behind and the opposite arm out in front in a balance that engages the core as well as the limbs.

Although the final 'Train like an Angel' video, staring Alessandra Ambrosio, has yet to be released, the teaser suggests it will involve moves such as lunges and toning stretches

Set in a slightly grimy and old looking warehouse, the videos show how the Angel's perfect their bodies 

The already toned Victoria's Secret Angles, like Adriana Lima, are beginning to fine tune their near flawless physiques in the run up to the highly anticipated catwalk show

The South African stunner recently opened up about how she achieves and maintains her incredible figure, admitting she’s been blessed with a fast metabolism but still strives to eat well and work out.

‘Food-wise, I'm very, very lucky that I can eat whatever I want. For me, I've always had a healthy lifestyle. If I eat something that’s not fresh, I feel it immediately, so I crave good food,’ she told OK! Magazine.

‘I crave meat. I grew up on a dairy and beef farm, so I crave that. I don’t cut anything out, and I just work out more,’ she explained. 

Although the final 'Train like an Angel' video, staring Alessandra Ambrosio, has yet to be released, the teaser suggests it will involve moves such as lunges and toning stretches.

With the brand due to host its first ever London fashion extravaganza on the 9th December the pressure is on for the models to make sure every inch looks perfect. 

While Justin Bieber, who famously appeared on the catwalk in 2012, and last year's musical model Rihanna, are unlikely to appear, big name singers and bigger name guests are expected to attend and the eyes of the world's media will be focused on the famous catwalk - and the bodies strutting down it.
