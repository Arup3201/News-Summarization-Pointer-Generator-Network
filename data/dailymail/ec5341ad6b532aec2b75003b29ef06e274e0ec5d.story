A nine-month-old northwest Missouri boy has died after being accidentally shot in the head by his five-year-old brother.

Emergency responders were called to a home in Elmo just before 9am on Monday after receiving a frantic call from the children's mother, Alexis Wiederholt.

She told emergency services that she needed an ambulance at her home as her five-year-old had shot her infant son Corbin in the head with a paintball gun, news she found out when the young boy ran to tell her; 'I'm sorry, Mom. I shot Corbin.'

She later found out it was in fact a revolver, and not a paintball gun, that had been fired.

'I walked in and there was my baby, lying there, bleeding," the young mother told NBC News.

'I had just hugged him in my arms five minutes before that.'

Alexis also revealed that she had no idea her father, William Porter, even kept a loaded gun in the home she and her children were visiting.

'I didn't know it was there until I turned around and saw it laying on the bed,' she said. 

'I don't know why someone would have a loaded gun in the house while kids were around.'

Porter said of the tragedy; 'I told the boys they weren't supposed to be in my bedroom where I keep the gun cabinet and they knew it — but like I said, boys will be boys.' 

When police arrived they discovered that the older boy had apparently found a loaded .22 caliber Magnum revolver which he was holding when it fired, injuring his younger brother, the Kansas City Star reported.

The loaded gun belonged to a family member and was kept on a shelf built into the headboard of the master bed, Sheriff White told Fox4. The playpen was in the same room.

The baby was taken by air ambulance to the hospital but was pronounced dead at Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City just before noon yesterday.

Authorities say their is no reason to believe the incident was anything other than a tragic accident, as Corbin's three older brothers (above with their mother) are now in the custody of a family relative

Nodaway County Sheriff Darren White said the baby was pronounced dead at Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City just before noon yesterday

White said there was no reason to believe the incident was anything other than a tragic accident.

Neighbor Jessica Hutchison, said: 'I think that gun safety could have come into play and would have maybe prevented the situation. It's just really sad altogether.'

The five-year-old boy along with two other siblings are in the custody of relatives. 

Amid increasing public concern about possession of guns, The Washington Post recently reported that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention (CDC) has not conducted research on gun control since 1996 despite President Barack Obama ordering the organization to resume studies two years ago.
