One was a rugby-loving university student, his father was a wealthy businessman and the mother a committed stay-at-home mum who was at the heart of a 'very happy' family. 

Devastated friends from Australia have paid tribute to axe attack victims Martin van Breda, 55, his wife Teresa, 54, and their son Rudi, 22, whose bodies were discovered in their exclusive golf-course estate home ​at Stellenbosch, about 50km east of Cape Town on Tuesday morning.

The tributes poured in this morning as Marli, 16, remains in a critical but stable condition in hospital with serious head injuries, and surviving brother Henri, 20, was questioned by police.

'You are a true blue genuine mate my friend,' said Rudi's university friend Afif Norzal, 22, who was in all of Rudi's classes at the University of Melbourne, in an online tribute. 

'At times when I didn't have anyone to talk to, you would definitely make me feel the most welcome... I will always love you.'

Marli's headmistress described her as a 'lovely, popular, clever girl' whose parents were involved in the school. The 16-year-old is in a critical condition with severe head injuries and a severed jugular 

It has been reported that a 'blood-spattered axe' was found at the home where there was no sign of a break-in

The family lived in Perth and on the Sunshine Coast before returning to South Africa in mid-2014.

Family friend Retha Dutton said Rudi was visiting his parents and siblings before he was set to return to university for his final year of his Masters of Engineering.

'He was one of those guys - me being from a different culture - he was one of the first friends who genuinely connected with me,' Mr Norzal told Daily Mail Australia in an interview. 

'He was one of those people when he talked to you, you genuinely knew this guy wanted to be your mate.'

'He was a really chilled and laidback person. He never stressed about anything.' Mr Norzal, from Malaysia, described the family as 'loving'. 

He graduated from Trinity College in 2011 and completed a Bachelor of Science at the university in 2013.

In a statement, a spokesman for the University of Melbourne told Daily Mail Australia: 'A Dean’s honors list member for Science in 2011, Rudi was a keen sportsman and was highly regarded amongst his peers as a good-natured and friendly person, someone who was always willing to lend a hand and help out younger students.' 

Henri returned to South Africa with his parents in mid-214. He had been living with his brother at Trinity College while studying at the University of Melbourne in 2013. Both attended Scotch College in Perth. 

'Teresa was a lovely mother,' Ms Dutton told Daily Mail Australia. 'She was so happy all her children were with her, the boys had came from Australia (to visit).

'Henri moved back to South Africa in the middle of last year and he stayed with his family. She loved having him with her. She always used to tell me how wonderful it was.' 

Family patriarch Martin was the managing director of Engel and Voelkers Australia, an international property firm which has offices in Perth and Queensland. Friends described him as a 'great man' with a bright future ahead of him. 

'(He) was going to change SA (South Africa),' Peter Armitage tweeted. 'Folks, live for today. Tell people you love them today.' 

Mr Armitage said Martin was the founder of Netstar and Woodhill College. Martin's golf club paid their 'deepest condolences' to the family on Twitter.

A friend and colleague at Engel and Voelker, Paul Freney, told Daily Mail Australia he and his wife Teresa, who was a stay and home mum, were committed parents to their three children.

Tragedy: The van Breda family had just moved back to South Africa in June after six years in Perth, Western Australia

Popular: Rudi Van Breda was popular with his friends at Trinity College and the University of Melbourne

'I heard about it yesterday. A mate of mine rang me up and I nearly fell off my chair,' Mr Freney said. 

'They were very nice people. Martin loved his rugby. He was an avid Force supporter from Western Australia.

'We used to go to the rugby together, he loved his golf.'

'Teresa... looked after the business of running the home and all that sort of stuff, and I imagine had a fair bit to do.'

'He was a very intelligent man and he was obviously very wealthy, had a lot of money, but it was all earned through his own endeavours.'   

The van Bredas had spent several years living in the Perth suburb of Claremont. Around 2012 they moved to the Sunshine Coast, where Engels and Volker had an office. 

Ms Dutton, whose daughter is close friends with Marli, said she last saw the family on January 2 in South Africa. She said they were a 'very, very happy family'. 

Marli was enrolled at Matthew Flinders Anglican College at Buderim while she was in Year 9. A school spokesman said the community was 'very sad to hear the tragic news'.

'Our thoughts and prayers are with Marli, her family and those who love her,' the spokesman said.  

She is currently a student Somerset College in South Africa.  

A close family friend described the van Breda's as 'like a perfect family'

The school's headmistress Meg Fargher, described the Year 11 student as a  'lovely, popular, clever girl' whose parents were very involved in the school, news24 reported. 

Both schools are providing access to counsellors for students.  

Emergency medical services spokesman Robert Daniels told reporters it was obvious that the victims were attacked with an axe.

'What I can say is they were not shot, the patients were axed,' Mr Daniels told the Cape Times. 'The daughter was rushed to hospital with severe head trauma and a severed jugular.

He said Henri was treated at the scene for minor bruises on his arms. 

Family friend Alexander Boshoff, 19, described the Van Bredas' as a 'typical happy family', according to South African news reports. 'Our families often spent holidays together. We have known each other for years,' he said.

Mr Boshoff said the family moved around a lot due to Martin's work but the boys never complained and then added that they were 'like a perfect family'.
