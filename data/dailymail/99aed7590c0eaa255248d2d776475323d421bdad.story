The crisis in A&E departments is being fuelled by a shocking rise in the elderly and frail being rushed to hospital in ambulances because there is no-where else for them to go.

Shocking new figures reveal that more than two thirds of the extra 330,000 patients admitted taken to casualty by ambulance are aged 80 or over.

And among the over-90s, there was a 66 per cent increase from 2009-10 to 2011-12, sparking claims that deep cuts in social care totalling £1.7billion were piling pressure on emergency departments.

Rise: In two years the number of people aged over 90 take to hospital by ambulance rose from 165,910 to 275,883

Row: Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham who unearthed the figures, called on Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to take urgent action to address the problem

Health ministers were challenged over the statistics from the Health and Social Care Information Centre in the Commons yesterday.

Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham claimed they ‘put a human face on the A&E crisis and paint a very sad picture indeed’.

He added: 'I am today calling on Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to take decisive action to improve care for the most elderly people in our society.'

Cuts to social care budgets across England mean elderly people and their relatives have little choice but to dial 999 to call an ambulance for help.

There are also warnings that once older people are admitted to hospital they cannot be discharged because of a lack of care available in communities.

Jeremy Hunt did not visit an A&E department until seven months after becoming Health Secretary, it has emerged.

He took up the post on September 4 last year but only went to St Thomas’ Hospital - opposite Parliament across the River Thames - on April 3 this year.

In the Commons today shadow health minister Jamie Reed said that hospital waiting times in England were at the worst levels seen for a decade.

He asked Mr Hunt: 'Do you actually regret waiting for six months before visiting an A&E unit and finding for yourself what damage your policies were doing to the frontline of the NHS?'

But Mr Hunt hit back at Labour’s own health failures, pointing out that the Mid Staffordshire Hospital scandal, which witnessed unusually high mortality rates, took place on their watch.

He added: 'We’ll take no lessons on being connected with the frontline from the party that missed 50 warning signs about what was happening in Mid Staffs.'

This so-called bed-blocking creates a backlog which means A&E departments cannot admit new people.

The chaos in A&E this year has been blamed on patients struggling to access out-of-hours care and the bungled introduction of the new 111 NHS advice line.

But official statistics reveal the dramatic increase in the elderly and their relatives dialling 999 has been building for the last three years.

In 2009-10 there were 165,910 people aged over 90 taken to A&E by an ambulance.

Two years later the number had rocketed by 66 per cent to 275,883.

Over the same period, the number of patients aged 80-89 rose by 19 per cent from 635,834 to 757,555 in 2011-12.

The rises were in stark contrast to other age groups, notably among children where the numbers fell by four per cent among the under-10s and almost 20 per cent for 10-19-year-olds.

Mr Burnham, who unearthed the ‘deeply 
troubling’ figures, said they show how ‘that something has gone 
seriously amiss with the way we care for very frail and very elderly 
people’.

He told MailOnline: ‘The question we have to ask is why are 100,000 more over-90s coming into A&E by ambulance.

‘In
many of these cases older people end up in ambulances simply because 
there isn’t better or more appropriate care available at home.The 
thought of someone over 90 coming into hospital via ambulance and what 
that must entail should make any politician pause for thought.

‘The
sheer disorientation of the whole experience of going to A&E, it is
the worse place really for them to be yet they are ending up there in 
ever greater numbers.’

Crisis: The government has been urged to act over the crisis in A&E, triggered by delays in out-of-hours care, the 111 NHS advice line and cuts to social care

Among all people turning up at A&E, the increase in attendance was also highest amongst the over 90s

Mr Burnham pointed to figures showing how the total social care budget had fallen by £1.7billion from 2009-10 to 2011-12.

‘Further cuts are planned this year and this problem will only get worse if no action is taken,’ Mr Burnham added.

In the Commons he  urged ministers to investigate the dramatic increases urgently and work to 'prevent the collapse of social care'.

Health minister Dan Poulter said both parties 'recognise quite rightly that there is a long-term challenge in providing more integrated joined up care to look after older people'.

But he claimed that Labour had 'failed to adequately invest in this area throughout its time in government'.

Last week a damning report revealed waiting times for A&E patients are at their highest point for nearly a decade.

The influential King’s Fund think tank said more than 300,000 patients waited for four hours or longer during the first three months of this year – nearly 6 per cent of all patients.

Chaos in out-of-hours care and the botched launch of the Government’s 111 non-emergency number have been accused of pushing many hospitals to breaking point, with senior A&E doctors warning they can no longer guarantee safe care for patients.
