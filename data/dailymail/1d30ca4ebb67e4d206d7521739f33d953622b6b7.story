It's September, 
Colorado bow hunting is underway, and rifle hunters are lining up for a 
hot new license: $25 to shoot down a government drone over the village 
of Deer Trail.

In fact, Deer Trail can't keep up with the demand for new licenses, even as the town yet to approve a new ordinance that would allow them to be issued.

Supporters acknowledge the 
licenses would be only symbolic - a gesture in protest of the use of drones domestically - and a town election authorizing them is
more than a month away.

Still, The Denver Post reported Thursday, about 1,000 people have applied for one.

Town clerk Kim Oldfield told the paper that she stopped counting the applications two weeks ago, after the number 
of personal checks made out to the town of Deer Trail was up to 983 - and for a staggering total of 
$19,006.

According to Oldfield, the checks came from all over the country.

'I'm still getting the letters,' she said. 'I'm just throwing them in a big pile.'

Residents of the tiny plains town an hour east of Denver are still split on the proposal.

In the crosshairs: It could soon be open-season for drones in one small Colorado town (symbolically, anyway)

The
scheme is part protest against government surveillance and part 
promotion to get Deer Trail some attention. It's working, at least on 
the second point. The federal government issued a warning against 
shooting at drones.

Phil Steel, a town resident who proposed the licenses, currently is selling novelty versions.

Earlier this week, Steel said he'd already sold 100 novelty licenses, and that he's given a portion of the $2,500 he's earned to the town.

Under Steel's proposal,license holders would be permitted to shoot down drones that are flying lower than 1,000 feet above private property.

The town's board could have approved the symbolic measure last month but deadlocked 3-3.

After the vote, the board opted to put the proposed ordinance to a vote with the plan of donating money made from the licensing fees to a local community center.

Residents of Deer Trail will have a chance to vote on the ordinance in a special election scheduled for October 8.
