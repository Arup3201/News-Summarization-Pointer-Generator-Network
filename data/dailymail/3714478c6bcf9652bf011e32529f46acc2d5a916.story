Incredible images have been released by the Department of Defence which captures Australian military aircraft during some recent aerial refueling operations.

Some of them include hornets flying in a formation over Australia's Northern Territory while another shows a Seahawk helicopter on the deck of HMAS Melbourne in Jervis Bay, south of Sydney.

There's also special insight into a combat mission in the Middle East as a photograph shows a Royal Australian Air Force aircraft refueling from a United States Air Force plane over international waters of Basra in southern Iraq. The deployment is part of the Australian contribution to enforce the elimination of weapons of mass destruction.
