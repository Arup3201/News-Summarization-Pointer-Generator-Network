Giving pledge: Groupon co-founder Eric Lefkofsky and his wife Liz are the latest to join billionaire club The Giving Pledge, which earmarks half their fortune for charitable causes

The CEO of Chicago-based discount deal website Groupon has become the latest billionaire to sign away half his fortune to charity.

Eric Lefkofsky and his wife Liz have glommed onto the elite billionaire’s club The Giving Pledge, which means they’ve earmarked at least half their $1.75 billion for philanthropic causes either over a lifetime or in their will.

The brainchild of Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, the group counts such wealthy notables as Mark Zuckerberg, Michael Bloomberg and Richard Branson.

‘Today Liz and I find ourselves in 
the rare position to be able to help so many people,’ Eric wrote in a 
letter on givingpledge.org. ‘We recognize that perhaps our greatest 
accomplishment — with the exception of the kids we raise — will come not
from businesses we started, but from the help we provide to people and 
causes around the world.’

The
couple also run their own charity called The Lefkofsky Family 
Foundation. The group’s global aims are to improve access to education, 
improve fundamental human  rights, catalyze medical innovation, and 
support cultural initiatives.

The
couple’s commitment was announced by the Giving Pledge along with 
Morningstar founder Joe Mansueto, Groupon investor Yuri Milner, AOL 
founder Steve Case, filmmaker George Lucas, venture capitalist John 
Doerr, as well as Zuckerberg.

The elite group, branded as ‘a 
commitment by the world's wealthiest individuals and families to 
dedicate the majority of their wealth to philanthropy,’ now numbers over
100.

‘In this season 
of giving, we are inspired by the millions of people across the globe 
who give what they can in meaningful and significant ways,’ Melinda 
Gates said.

‘The Giving Pledge is rooted in this spirit and hopes to inspire people to tackle problems that are inherently difficult and diverse in an effort to address the pressing social issues they care about most.’

While admirable, these billionaires’ commitments don’t necessarily represent anything new.

The Lefkofskys’ charity was established back in 2006 and fellow pledger Bob Parsons, founder of GoDaddy.com, made that clear to Forbes.

‘For me to do the pledge is no change,’ Parsons said. ‘It’s not like I am joining and going to start giving. I’ve already been giving.’
