Rachael Cordingley has learned that good things come to those who wait. 

Nearly 10 months since she was proposed to by partner Carl Froch, the glamour model has finally received her engagement ring. 

It seems Froch was simply waiting for the right moment and Cordingley revealed the glittery band with a special Valentines Day tweet on her official account.

Carl Froch had initially asked Cordingley marry him in May last year after his fight with George Groves

Froch initially popped the question after Cordingley rushed over to him to congratulate him on the eight-round stoppage in his rematch with George Groves in May last year.

He did not let the watching 80,000 crowd at Wembley, going crazy after witnessing Froch's unstoppable right hand which ended the fight, put him off. 

At the time, though, Froch didn't have a ring, so making the engagement official had to be delayed. 

The couple already have two children together, a son named Rocco and a daughter, Natalia.
