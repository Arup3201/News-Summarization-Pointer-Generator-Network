Sir John Major has revealed how he was left ‘seething’ by Margaret Thatcher when she made a ‘wildly over the top’ personal attack on him.

The former Prime Minister said the ‘soup went cold’ when she turned on him at a dinner with Tory MPs.

Sir John lifts the lid on his stormy relations with Lady Thatcher in a new book, The Real Iron Lady, extracts from which are published today in The Mail on Sunday.

Baroness Gillian Shephard's book 'The Real Iron Lady' contains revelations that Margaret Thatcher flirted with leaders

Written by Gillian Shephard, a Cabinet Minister under Thatcher and Major, it reveals:

It is well known that, though Sir John succeeded Lady Thatcher in Downing Street with her support in 1990, they later fell out. Until now, he has never spoken about their behind-closed-doors quarrels.

But in Baroness Shephard’s book, he gives a dramatic blow-by-blow account of how she was capable of ‘great intimidation’. Sir John recalls a private dinner with Margaret Thatcher when she was in No 10 and he was a Treasury Whip. He had been asked to spell out Tory MPs’ concerns about her policies.

Baroness Gillian Shepherd says there was a 'sexual' spark between former French president Francois Mitterrand and Margaret Thatcher

Cabinet ministers mocked Margaret Thatcher for her habit of breaking off meetings to make tea for everyone

‘I said the party was not enamoured of our policy. We were close to facing a rebellion. “What exactly are they concerned about?” came an icy voice from across the table, as her soup went cold.

Margaret Thatcher was married to Denis Thatcher but is said to have flirted with Francois Mitterrand

'Margaret was livid and began attacking me .  .  . her reaction was wildly over the top. Infuriated by the injustice of her behaviour, I said it was my job to report the party view whether the PM liked it or not.

‘At the end of the evening, the Deputy Chief Whip whispered in my ear that I “might care to make peace with the Prime Minister”. I did not. I was still seething at the injustice of  her attack.’

In sharp contrast, the book says that Lady Thatcher ‘flirted’ with political leaders such as Mitterrand and President Ronald Reagan.

Baroness Shephard told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Mitterrand thought she was very attractive and there  was definitely an electric current –  a sexual spark – between them.

‘He was a renowned ladies’ man and regarded her as a challenge.’

Lady Thatcher’s Chief Whip, Lord Jopling, praises her ‘caring’ treatment of Tory MPs brought down in sex scandals.

As
a barrister she had learnt that some men could not resist ‘feasting 
with leopards’ and adulterous male MPs kicked out by their wives were 
invited to join the Thatchers for Christmas lunch at Chequers.

The
book says grammar school-educated Thatcher’s privileged male Cabinet 
Ministers mocked her behind her back. Diplomat Sir Richard  Parsons, 
former envoy to Spain, was ‘shocked by their distinctly satirical 
attitude’ towards her.

He reveals that she was ridiculed for ‘her amiable habit of breaking off long meetings at No 10 to go upstairs and personally brew tea and coffee for all concerned’.

Former aide Harvey Thomas recalls that Lady Thatcher wept uncontrollably when told of the  sinking of the Atlantic Conveyor in the Falklands War, which resulted  in the deaths of 12 British sailors.

He says: ‘Margaret’s tears flowed for almost 40 minutes as she felt the burden of being, as she put it, “the first Prime Minister in decades to have to send young British soldiers to their death in conflict”.’

The Real Iron Lady is published by Biteback on March 24.
