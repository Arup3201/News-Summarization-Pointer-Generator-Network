Australian F1 driver Daniel Ricciardo has topped the leaderboard as the fastest driver in Top Gear's 'Star in a Reasonably Priced Car' challenge.

Dethroning Britain's Lewis Hamilton in the latest episode of the show, host Jeremy Clarkson said Ricciardo made the best time he's ever seen.

'That’s the fastest anybody’s ever gone around our track,' Clarkson declared during the episode.

Ricciardo's time has overtaken reigning F1 world champion Lewis Hamilton previous best set two years ago

Earlier in the week Ricciardo had already set his sights on toppling Hamilton and his attempt at the famous Dunsfold Aerodrome site in Surrey was screened on February 8. 

Hamilton's time took some beating as he is the fastest of all the F1 drivers to have raced on the makeshift circuit. He is ahead of the likes of Sebastian Vettel, Damon Hill, Nigel Mansell and Rubens Barrichello.

The 30-year-old Mercedes driver, who clinched his second Formula One world title last year, set his time two years ago in a Suzuki Liana - a car reserved for the F1 stars.

Ahead of his crack at Hamilton's time, 25-year-old Ricciardo said: 'It's been a while since I heard people asking "When are you going to go on Top Gear?", so the time has come.'

The Red Bull driver, who won three grands prix last season, added: 'I hope it's cold so the engine is crisp, but I also hope it's dry so I can actually have a good crack.

'We'll see how we go. I believe Lewis has the crown at the moment, so it would be nice to take at least one title off him.'

Ricciardo recently took a classic Alfa Romeo for a spin on the route of one of Targa Florio, the legendary endurance sportscar race that was held on the roads of Sicily from 1906 to 1977.

In an exclusive for The Red Bulletin, the driver relished the opportunity to race 70 Alfa T33 to be a good mover.

'It does what you expect it to: it’s a proper racing car!' he said of the 700kg motor that generates more than 400bhp.

Swapping the track for the slopes; Ricciardo and fellow Red Bull man Daniil Kvyat appeared at Milton Keynes' SnoZone last month, for a 'Meet the Drivers' event alongside team principal Christian Horner.

Former driver turned pundit David Coulthard was also present, as the team enjoyed the slopes on skis and sledges. 

The latest episode of Top Gear featuring Daniel Ricciardo will air on Monday at 7.30pm on BBC Knowledge.
