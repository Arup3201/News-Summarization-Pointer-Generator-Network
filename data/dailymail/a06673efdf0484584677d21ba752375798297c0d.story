Passengers have been struck down by an outbreak of gastric illness and confined to their cabins for the second time this month on a luxury ship operated by Fred Olsen Cruise Lines.

It is not known how many passengers have been hit by the vomiting bug on the MV Balmoral, which is sailing to its home port in Southampton.

Fred Olsen Cruise Lines confirmed staff are attempting to contain an ‘extremely contagious gastric illness’, just days after the ship underwent a ‘deep clean’ in response to an earlier outbreak.

A relative of a passenger who is currently on board the Balmoral said quarantine restrictions have been imposed at least twice during the 13-night return journey from Southampton to the Azores and Madeira.

The relative told MailOnline Travel at least one swimming pool and casino tables were made off-limits to those on the vessel.

It left the UK on May 11 and is scheduled to return on Sunday on a voyage priced from approximately £1,000 per person.

The ship, which has a capacity of 1,350, is scheduled to depart the same day on a seven-night cruise to Amsterdam and Antwerp.

A spokeswoman for Fred Olsen Cruise Lines told MailOnline Travel: ‘It is very frustrating that, even though we went to great lengths to “deep clean” and sanitise the ship before this cruise set sail, a number of guests have been affected by gastric illness.

‘The number of guests affected is smaller than on the previous sailing, but it is very disappointing that any guests should have their cruise holiday impacted in this unfortunate way.

‘As always, we are doing all that we can to contain the spread of this extremely contagious gastric illness, in line with Fred Olsen's approved prevention and control plan.

The spokeswoman said guests who are ill are required to remain in their cabins, with complimentary room service and entertainment, to minimise contact with other guests.

It is not the first time Fred Olsen cruise passengers have been hit by gastric illnesses.

Between October 2009 and May 2010, 130 passengers fell ill on its cruise liner Boudicca, a sister ship of that involved in the latest incident. In 2014, the company paid out £280,000 compensation to those affected.

In March and April 2011, 12 passengers sailing around the Mediterranean became ill, again on Boudicca, with some later given £10,000 payouts.

Then in 2013, the company reported an outbreak of 'a gastroenteritis-type illness' on Boudicca after it left Belfast for a 10-night 'Scandinavian Cities Cruise'. In that case, 72 passengers were affected.

This was followed by an outbreak on the Balmoral earlier this month as it sailed to the Norwegian fjords. A law firm said it has been contacted by passengers to investigate the cause of their illness.

She added: ‘The gastro-enteritis virus is spread very easily by contact with surfaces and from person-to-person, and all Fred Olsen guests are made aware of the importance of meticulous hygiene at all times.’

Earlier this month it was estimated hundreds of passengers were hit by a vomiting bug – believed to be norovirus – that forced Fred Olsen to cut short an eight-day cruise to the Norwegian fjords.

The earlier outbreak on the ship – which was carrying 1,163 passengers at the time – was so bad it returned to its home port a day early to be ‘systematically sanitised’ ahead of its trip to the Azores and Madeira.

Some of those who fell ill with diarrhoea, stomach cramps and fever have instructed a law firm to investigate the cause of their illness.

Fred Olsen Cruise Lines believed the illness was brought onto the ship, as the first case was reported within hours of its departure from Southampton on May 3, and it takes 12 to 48 hours for norovirus symptoms to appear.

The company said it asks guests complete a medical questionnaire before each voyage, and reminds them to use sanitising hand gel and take other precautions on board.

It also said frequent cleaning of all areas of the ship is carried out.

The spokeswoman said: ‘At Fred Olsen Cruise Lines, the health, safety and well-being of all our guests and crew is paramount, and we believe that our systems for preventing the spread of illness on board our ships are amongst the best within the industry.’
