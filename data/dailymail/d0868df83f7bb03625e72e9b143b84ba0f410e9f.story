Mission: Mira Sorvino works with the United Nations to stamp out human trafficking

She is a glamorous Hollywood star who has graced hundreds of red carpets.

But the cause closest to Mira Sorvino's heart is a long journey from the bright lights of Tinseltown and into the dark world of human trafficking.

In a moving interview with Mail Online, she told how one heartrending meeting with an imprisoned sex slave had changed her life and made her even more determined to end the trade she branded a 'hideous scourge'.

The 45-year-old described coming face-to-face with the woman, who was wrongly locked-up for killing the man who had taken her captive when she was 16.

Despite the real murderer confessing to the crime, she had still spent much of her youth in a jail cell.

She had also endured years of horrific abuse at the hands of the human trafficker. He would routinely threaten her with black magic and say he would murder members of her family.

‘Although she had wanted to commit suicide, she did not,’ Mira said. ‘She told me “I have nothing left to give on this earth, beside staying on and enduring to keep my brother alive.’

‘To see in her eyes deep, excoriating pain and yet to hear no bitterness in her words, after spending her entire youth incarcerated for a crime someone else ultimately confessed to, was extraordinary.’

‘More extraordinary still was her commitment to help others and become a fighter of this hideous scourge.’

Mira’s latest project is CNN documentary Mozambique or Bust which features the pioneering work of a small American charity Free The Girls.

The project was set up to help 
victims of human trafficking in an innovative and highly unusual way – 
by sending bras to Mozambique where they can be sold by freed sex 
slaves.

Set up by Denver housewife Kimba Langas, who thought her appeal for unwanted lingerie would only have moderate success.

But she was completely overwhelmed when women sent her 20,000 bras but was then faced with the fresh challenge of getting them shipped to Africa.

The problem was when Paul Jarzombek, the CEO of shipping company LR International stepped in and offered free transportation from Chicago to Maputo.

‘Kimba is an amazing person, a stay-at-home mom with a dream and gumption as big as the sky’, Mira said.

‘She proves that there are no limitations to what we can do to fight slavery if we put our minds and hearts to it.’

The actress said that the idea of selling bras was both surprising and inspirational.

‘I
like the idea that these are items that would exclusively be bought by 
women, so that the women and girls selling them wouldn’t have to sell 
them to me, and possibly be intimidated or retrafficked by them.

‘They
are being set up to succeed, in a safe zone. I think it was a great, 
genius idea and proves that you don’t need money to fight human 
trafficking.

‘Kimba’s story shows that you do not need special expertise. Everyone has something that they can do.’

The
documentary features the stories of two women, Tashina, who was 
trafficked when she was 15, and Ofelia who became a sex slave when she 
was 12.

Both are now selling
Free The Girls bras and supporting themselves. ‘We lived in darkness,’ 
Tashina said before talking optimistically about the future.

For
the women of Mozambique, bras are a difficult item to acquire and 
highly-coveted. The people  who sell them make about three time the 
living wage.

Mira, 45, said she was particularly moved by Tashina’s devotion to her child.

‘As
a mom of four, I relate to her quest to make sure her daughter’s life 
does not follow the same terrible road hers did,’ she said.

‘She is an incredibly brave and beautiful person’.

The
Mighty Aphrodite actress was first exposed to the issue of modern-day 
slavery as a spokesman for Amnesty International’s campaign Stop 
Violence Against Women three years ago.

But
she says it was meeting survivors of modern day slavery and human 
trafficking that really spurred her to take up the cause.  

She
was asked to become a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Office
on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), something she considers a great honour.

‘I
was thrilled with the reach and gravitas of the position,’ she said. 
‘It has been one of the most challenging and rewarding things I have 
ever undertaken.’

Mira said 
that she would encourage people to get involved in grassroots projects 
like Free The Girls and urged people to get in touch with organisations 
battling to end sex trafficking.

‘She
said: 'A first step could be a call to the National Human Trafficking 
Resource Center, a 24/7 hotline that not only is a highly effective 
tipline that leads to the rescue of thousands of trafficking victims, 
but an informational hub for those who want to get involved in the fight
to end slavery. 

'They 
have a grid of nationwide abolitionist groups, so you can find one in 
your area that will appreciate your specific skill set.

'If
people would like to donate funds, no sum is too small to begin helping
victims across the globe; the UN's Voluntary Trust Fund for the Victims
of Human Trafficking gives grants to meticulously vetted NGOs that work
directly with victims, providing them with rescue and rehabilitation to
reclaim their lives; as we see with Free the Girls does, these 
non-governmental organisations that can do truly miraculous things.'
