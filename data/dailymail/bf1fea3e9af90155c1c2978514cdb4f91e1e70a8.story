Forget Cara Delevingne and Karlie Kloss, there are a whole host of fresh new fashion faces on the scene who are quickly becoming the toast of the modeling industry - before they've even reached their twelfth birthdays.

According to an article by Jane Ridley at the New York Post, these mini models are now among some of fashion's highest-earning stars, with many commanding six-figure sums for one television commercial and up to $1,500 per day for editorial work.

Take 11-year-old Ekaterina Samsonov. Despite her young age, Ekat - as she is known to her friends - has already appeared in campaigns for the likes of J Crew, DKNY, Macy's and JC Penney, earning a reported $50,000 in the last year alone.

And as if that wasn't enough, the pint-sized fashion star has also landed herself roles in two upcoming movies. The first, Anesthesia, which also stars Kristen Stewart, is due out later this year, while indie drama The Ticket is set to hit screens some time in 2015.

Then there's Hudson Kroenig, the six-year-old son of Chanel model and muse Brad Kroenig and his wife Nicole. 

Hudson made his catwalk debut alongside his famous father in the Chanel S/S ’11 show and since then has gone on to appear in campaigns for Fendi and Dolce & Gabbana. He has also appeared in the pages of Harper's Bazaar and W Magazine.

While Hudson's annual earnings are kept a closely-guarded secret by his parents, it's thought that he is most likely to be one of the world's top-earning child models, thanks in large part, no doubt, to his impressive fashion heritage.

1. Ekaterina Samsonov, $50k

The 11-year-old had a bumper year thanks to campaigns for J Crew, Macy's and JC Penney - to name but a few. She also earned an unspecified five-figure sum for her work on a Nutella commercial for network TV that took a day to film.

2. Baylor and Hudson Cryder, $45k each

Both Baylor, 10, and Hudson, 7, have well and truly earned their place among fashion's elite, after landing jobs with the likes of Ralph Lauren Children, J.Crew and Oscar de la Renta Kids.

3. Lily Chee, $22k

After being discovered by a Whilemena Models scout while shopping with her dad, 11-year-old Lily has worked with Nike, Levi's, Kohls, Uniqlo and Ralph Lauren. 

4. Julian O’Neill, $12,500

Despite his young age, seven-year-old Julian has already worked with a huge number of high-profile brands, including Hanna Andersson, Euroclub Kids, Roberto Cavalli Kids, Vogue Bambini and Toys R Us.

5. Hudson Kroenig, unknown

While six-year-old Hudson's exact earnings have not been revealed, insiders believe that the Chanel campaign star is likely to be one of the highest-earning mini models around.

And while Ralph Lauren model Lily Chee took a slightly different route into the industry - she was discovered by a Whilemina Models scout while shopping with her dad Max two years ago - that hasn't stopped her from amassing an extensive portfolio of editorial work which includes campaigns for Nike, Levi’s, Kohls and Uniqlo.

The 11-year-old's modeling  has earned her $22,000 in the last year - a figure which looks set to keep rising if her popularity continues.

There are also a number of sibling mini models currently scaling the fashion ladder.  

Baylor and Hudson Cryder are two of the most popular child models currently working in the industry and the pair have achieved the type of success that many adult models can only dream of.

Baylor, 10, recently appeared on the front cover of Vogue Bambino, while Hudson, 7, was flown out to the Bahamas in order to appear alongside British socialite India Hicks in a Ralph Lauren shoot.

'It was crazy,' mother Mary said of the whirlwind trip during an interview with the New York Post. 'But most of the work is in and around New York City.'

Sisters Emilie and Alexandra Su lead a similarly jet-set lifestyle. The duo regularly appear alongside each other on high-profile campaigns around the world and have recently worked with the likes of Saks Fifth Avenue, Target, Uniqlo, H&M, GlaxoSmithKline and Nickelodeon.

Thankfully for the pair, their mother, Jayne Choi, is incredibly supportive of their early career path. 

'I love the confidence [that] modeling has brought my daughters,' she told the New York Post. 'They have good manners and the poise and focus [that] you need in this industry.'

According to renowned children's photographer Lee Clower, it's not the parents' opinions who matter when it comes to child modeling - but rather the young fashionistas who are doing the work. 

The New-York based snapper's work is regularly featured in Vogue Bambino and PetitePARADE magazines and he has worked on numerous occasions with many of the world's leading young models.

He told MailOnline: 'The most important element of a star kid is that the kid wants to be there at the shoot, not that the mom wants the kid there.'
