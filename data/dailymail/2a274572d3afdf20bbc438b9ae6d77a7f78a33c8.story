Two teenage boys from Wyoming have been charged in a triple homicide targeting
a 40-year-old woman and her elderly parents after the suspects told police their
goal was to steal the family’s Audi and flee to Denver.

Stephen Hammer, 19, and Tanner Vanpelt, 18, both of Cody, made their first
court appearance Tuesday morning in a case that has rattled residents of the
small town of Clark near the Wyoming-Montana border.

Each is charged with 11 felony counts, including premeditated murder, use of
a deadly weapon and robbery. Some of the charges could carry the death penalty.

Accused killers: Tanner Vanpelt, 18, left, and Stephen Hammer, 19, right, have been charged with 11 felony counts each in connection to a triple homicide, which took place during an alleged car theft

Innocent victim: Ildiko Freitas, 40, was found shot dead inside the Clark, Wyoming, home alongside her parents

They were arrested after neighbors described two young men entering the
house Saturday where the victim's bodies were found at around 11.15am.

The neighbors saw two vehicles speeding away, including a black Audi
belonging to Ildiko Freitas, 40, who owned the house with her husband, John.
Freitas and her parents, Janos Volgyesi, 69, and Hildegard Volgyesi, 70, were
found dead inside the house.

John Freitas, who works in the oil industry, was away on business
at the time of the murders, Powell Tribune reported.

Family torn apart: Freitas, pictured left with her father, Janos Volgyesi, and right with her mother, Hildegard, emigrated from Germany and spent years in California until the elderly couple retired and moved to Wyoming

Police tracked down the vehicles several miles from the crime scene and
arrested Vanpelt and Hammer without incident.

According to court documents filed Tuesday, after being arrested, Hammer
told investigators they used two 9 mm handguns the pair stole along with eight
other weapons last week from a Cody gun store and went to the house to steal
the Audi and leave the state.

Vanpelt got into an argument with Freitas over the car and that's when he
pulled out a gun and shot her, according to the documents.

Remote locale: Freitas, her husband and the woman's parents shared a home on Big View Road in the small community of Clarke, where they had moved six years prior from California

Hammer then went into the basement after hearing something there and shot a
woman he encountered, Freitas' mother, Hildegard Volgyesi. Vanpelt told authorities
he also went downstairs and shot the woman twice because it appeared she wasn't
dead.

When Vanpelt was taking the Audi, the two young men encountered Freitas'
father, Janos Volgyesi, in the garage and Vanpelt shot him twice in the back,
the documents state.

After their arrest, Hammer and Vanpelt led investigators to an irrigation
pipe several miles from the shooting scene where they had hidden the two 9 mm
handguns.

It's unclear how the teens knew about the Audi. Residents of Clark said
Hammer used to live with his family in town but had moved away several years
ago.

Hammer told investigators he was ‘sorry for shooting “that lady,”’ according
to the documents. Vanpelt said ‘they had not planned it to go down this way.’

Neighbors on Big View Road where the slain family had lived said that they
noticed a suspicious white sedan pull up to the Freitas' house around 11am
Saturday. Two young men went in the front door.

Life cut short: Freitas worked as a registered nurse until last year, and she and her husband were planing to move to Colorado, where they had bought a second home

About 20 minutes later, the white Ford Taurus sedan and Freitas’ black Audi A4
were seen speeding away, with the family’s dogs in pursuit, according to neighbors.

Local residents went to check up on the homeowners and return their pets,
only to discover  Ildiko Freitas and her
father Janos Volgyesi shot dead. Hildegard Volgyesi’s body was found in the
basement by police who responded to a 911 call.

Clark volunteer firefighter and retired Baltimore cop Jerry Ruth was one of
the first on the scene. He gathered some information and spoke to witnesses,
but left after local police arrived.

As Ruth was driving away from the Freitas' home en route to a baby shower,
he spotted the white Ford and Audi on the road ahead of him and called 911,
leading to the arrest of the two suspects.

Freitas grew up in Bakersfield, California, and attended the University of
Wyoming before moving to Clark with her husband six or seven years ago.

Last year, the couple bought another house in Loveland, Colorado, that they
had been renovating and were planning to move into sometime soon, said neighbor
David Mathiesen.

Freitas' brother, Thomas Volgyesi, told The Associated Press
Monday that he knew of no connection between the suspects and his family.

Volgyesi said his parents retired and moved from Sothern
California to Wyoming four years ago for its more relaxed lifestyle.

Average Joe: Vanpelt graduated in December 2011 from Cody High School, where the principal recalled that the teen wasn't involved in sports or clubs, but also never had serious discipline issues

Drastic change: Shocked neighbors described Hammer as a likable and well-mannered boy

‘They were the only family I have and I'm left with nothing
now,’ Volgyesi said. ‘To have them taken away from me like this, I'm not
registering it yet.’

The Volgyesis and their children, Ildiko and Thomas,
immigrated to the United States from Germany decades ago.

‘They were a fantastic family,’ said friend Teri Taylor
Thompson of Bakersfield, California.

The woman described Mrs Volgyesi as a kind woman, and said
that her daughter was very devoted to her parents.

Ildiko Freitas worked as a registered nurse at West Park
Hospital from September 2008 until September 2012, according to hospital
spokesman Joel Hunt. On her Facebook page, the woman wrote that she was unemployed.

Vanpelt's father, Robb Vanpelt, said Monday that his son was not living with
him and had not been in serious trouble before his arrest, which was ‘pretty
much totally out of the blue.’

Tanner Vanpelt graduated in December 2011 from Cody High School, where
principal Brandon Jensen recalled that the teenager wasn't involved in
athletics or after-school clubs, but also never had serious discipline issues.

Hammer attended the school only a year before transferring during his
freshman year, Jensen said.

A former neighbor to the Hammer family, Jennifer Bays,
recalled Stephen as a likable and well-mannered boy.

‘I can’t understand what happened to him,’ Bays wrote in a
comment on the Tribune’s website. ‘It has shown me that you REALLY never know
someone.’

Residents of Clark said it's the first murders they can recall in decades in
the rural community dominated by agriculture that sits near the Clarks Fork of
the Yellowstone River.
