The boss of a crisis-hit hospital says she fears it is in a ‘downward spiral’ and that patients are ‘scared’ to go there after alleged blunders were exposed.

A leaked email from Philippa Slinger, chief executive of Wexham Park Hospital, near Slough, reveals she fears there will be a boycott by local GPs frightened to refer patients.

And she says that could force her to axe services, with the risk of the hospital’s collapse.

The chief executive of Wexham Park Hospital fears GPs will boycott the hospital after alleged blunders were exposed

The warning comes after The Mail on Sunday published details two weeks ago of a secret official report into claims that blunders at Wexham Park have been covered up for 14 years.

A whistleblower heard by the InPractice investigation into Wexham, which serves half a million people in the Thames Valley, said that up to 50 patients may have died needlessly.

In the email sent last week, Ms Slinger says the disclosures have made patients ‘scared to come here’.

She adds: ‘We can all imagine how anxious relatives might be as they know the ambulance is bringing their loved one to us.

‘Local GPs and referrers will start to be very worried about us and the quality of medical staff. How much longer will they continue to refer? If they stop, we will have to trim back departments and services.’

The crisis has been fuelled by a dispute among doctors – 24 ethnic minority consultants wrote to the Care Quality Commission health watchdog to claim there had been ‘harassment’ over blunders, and that their white colleagues were let off.

That conflict escalated last night after another leaked email from the head of surgery, Dr Emmanuel Umerah, claimed the protest had been signed by ‘every person of colour’ accused of a medical blunder.

However, a well-placed source said last night that not all of the seven ethnic minority doctors accused of mistakes had signed the letter.
