Police have released a hilarious dashboard camera video showing a woman wearing 'zombie' contact lenses and dressed as a pig as she is arrested for DUI.

Kristine Gagnier from Orlando, Florida, 
was pulled over just before 2am on November 1 after she was 
spotted driving her Chevy Cavalier erratically following a Halloween party.

While her mug shot - showing her white, zombie-like eyes - was released after the incident back in November, this is the first time the police have released the video.

The video shows Gagnier wearing a skimpy flesh-colored leotard lined with markings for different cuts of meat, such as 'ribs', 'belly' and 'shoulder'.

Busted: Kristine Gagnier is pictured in handcuffs wearing a pig suit that is marked with meat cutlets after she was stopped for driving erratically in November. She was charged with a DUI

Making a pig's ear of it: She failed a sobriety test even though she claimed she had only had two beers

As she is led from her car, she apologizes for her appearance, adding: 'I'm a pig.'

In the footage, the officer asks Gagnier, a wakeboarder from Orlando, if she is drunk, but she insists she has only had two beers.

He then asks her to take a sobriety test, but she can be seen wobbling as she steps along a line. She was arrested and was taken to the Orange County DUI Center by Deputy Jeff Lotter.

'While behind the vehicle I observed 
it leave the travel lane to the right, crossing over the fog line, and 
then over the lane divider line to the left, and then over the lane 
divider line to the right,' said Deputy Lotter in his report.

Spooky: Gagnier was also wearing zombie-like contact lenses when she was arrested. After tests, she was found to have a blood-alcohol level of .120, while the limit for drivers in Florida is .08

Shortly after 3am, Gagnier had a breath test and her blood-alcohol level was found to be 15 times the state limit.

Gagnier had a blood-alcohol level of .120, while the limit for Florida drivers is .08, reports the Orlando Sentinel.

The
 deputy noted 'several indicators that lead me to believe that Gagnier 
was impaired,' including an alcohol odor, red eyes, slurred speech and 
an 'admittance to drinking,' the report said.

Gagnier is now working towards completing a pretrial-diversion program in her case.
