Fury: Bill de Blasio (pictured) went to lengths to praise the protesters' 'peaceful' behaviour despite such chants as, 'What do we want? Dead cops! When do we want it? Now!'

New York's mayor, Bill de Blasio, has been branded a 'total nicompoop' after he used the word 'allegedly' to describe a mob assault by protesters on two police lieutenants.

NYPD top brass are furious at de Blasio's implication that the beating may not have happened, claiming no such skepticism is ever shown when officers are accused of violence against civilians.

He made the remarks after the two officers were set upon by protesters during a demonstration on Brooklyn Bridge against recent police killings, including the 'chokehold' death of Eric Garner in July.

He went to lengths to praise the protesters' 'peaceful' behaviour despite such chants as, 'What do we want? Dead cops! When do we want it? Now!'

He went on to dismiss the assault as 'an incident ... in which a small group of protesters allegedly assaulted some members of the NYPD,' the New York Post reported.

'When cops are the accused, the word 'alleged' never enters into the discussion,' Michael Palladino, president of the NYPD Detectives' Endowment Association, told the paper.

Ed Mullins of the Sergeants Benevolent Association, called de Blasio a 'total nincompoop' for his handling of the affair, adding: 'His actions are contributing to the injuries that are being received by the NYPD.

'Maybe he should be out there to take the broken nose for the lieutenant. Ask him if he'd be willing to stand out there and take the punches for the cops.' 

The incident began when the two officers arrested a City University of New York professor, Eric Linsker, 29, as he tried to pour a rubbish bin onto other cops from a pedestrian overpass.

They were punched and kicked in the heads, leaving them needing instant medical attention. 

Ironically, the officers were from the department's Legal Bureau and were only present at the protest to ensure that demonstrators' civil rights were respected by police. 

It is the latest controversy in a long-running stand off between New Yorkers and police following a spate of deaths in custody.

'Don't insult my sacrifice': De Blasio's comments came days after the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association told him to stay away from funerals of cops killed in the line of duty, posting a form (above) on its website that members could download and sign

 They include the death of Eric Garner, a 43-year-old black man who died when officer Daniel Pantaleo attempted to subdue him in Tompkinsville, Staten Island, on July 17, with 'chokehold' restraining technique that is banned under NYPD protocol.

Thousands of
demonstrators marched in Washington, New York, Boston, Chicago and Oakland on
Saturday to protest against killings of unarmed black men by
police officers.

Organizers said the marches were among the largest in a
recent wave of protests against the deaths that have cast a
global spotlight on race relations in the United States.

The rallies were mainly peaceful, though police in Boston
said they arrested 23 people who tried to block a highway.

Officers in Oakland, California said they detained about 45
people for vandalism, failure to disperse, resisting arrest and
other charges after thousands took to the
streets.

Decisions by grand juries to return no indictments against
the officers involved in the deaths of Michael Brown in Missouri
and Eric Garner in New York have put police treatment of
minorities back on the national agenda.

'We're going to keep the light on Mike Brown ... on all of
the victims. The only way you make roaches run is to keep the
light on,' said civil rights leader the Rev. Al Sharpton, whose
National Action Network organized the Washington rally. 

Marchers, including many parents with children, chanted 'No
justice, no peace, no racist police' and 'Hands up, don't
shoot.' Protesters carried signs that said 'All men are created
equal' and 'Black lives matter.'

Relatives of Eric Garner and Akai Gurley, who were killed by
New York police, Brown and Trayvon Martin, slain by a Florida
neighborhood watchman in 2012, all took part in the Washington
rally

Then, last week, a grand jury in Staten Island sparked global outrage after it refused to indict Pantaleo over the chokehold that killed the father-of-six.

The confrontation began when Pantaleo arrested him for illegally selling cigarettes on the street.

In the ensuing tussle, the officer put Garner in the controversial headlock moments before Garner was heard saying: 'I can't breathe.'

They turned out to be the last words he ever spoke. He passed out and later died in hospital.

His final words became a rallying cry for thousands of protesters who took to the streets in New York and other cities after Pantaleo escaped indictment.

A de Blasio spokesman refused to comment on why the mayor chose to include the word 'allegedly' while describing the Brooklyn Bridge attack.

'Last night, the mayor could not have been more clear that violence in protests will not be tolerated and that our police should be commended for the professionalism and service they have displayed throughout these marches,' spokesman Phil Walzak said.

The fallout couldn't come at a worse time for de Blasio, whose relationship with the NYPD has soured in recent months.

It comes two days after the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association told de Blasio to stay away from funerals of cops killed in the line of duty for his 'consistent refusal to show police officers the support and respect they deserve.'

The union posted a form on its website that members could download and sign, barring the mayor and City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito from their service.

It read: 'I, as a New York City police officer, request that Mayor Bill de Blasio and City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito refrain from attending my funeral services in the event that I am killed in the line of duty,' the waiver states.

'Due to Mayor de Blasio and Speaker Mark-Viverito's consistent refusal to show police officers the support and respect they deserve, I believe that their attendance at the funeral of a fallen New York City police officer is an insult to that officer's memory and sacrifice.'

In a joint statement, de Blasio and Mark-Viverito described the snub as 'deeply disappointing'.
