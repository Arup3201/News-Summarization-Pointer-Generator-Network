It has emerged that procedures used by Hollywood actress Gwyneth Paltrow could easily cost around £14,000 a month

Her fresh-faced looks have earned her a multi-million pound fortune. And it appears Gwyneth Paltrow ensures no expense is spared when it comes to maintaining them.

It has emerged that the procedures used by the Hollywood actress could easily cost around £14,000 a month.

From holistic treatments to weekly facials, not to mention the services of a hair stylist and make-up artist for personal appearances, Miss Paltrow’s regime does not come cheap.

The 42-year-old mother of two is said to enjoy Reiki stress reduction massage on a monthly basis, which typically costs £185 for 90 minutes resulting in an annual spend of as much as £2,220.

The Oscar-winning actress is also said to be a fan of the intravenous vitamin therapy at the Be Hive of Healing centre in Los Angeles. Costing up to £289 per session, it is estimated Miss Paltrow has at least one a month and could easily hand over as much as £3,500 a year.

The lymphatic massage at Be Hive is also a must-have for the star. Costing around £130, the 90-minute procedure allows toxins to be released and the benefits no doubt outweigh the £1,600 she could spend in a year

The Iron Man star, whose net worth is estimated at £40million, is also believed to indulge twice a year in Thermage laser treatment on her face, brows and neck, thought to cost almost £17,000.

In between these sessions, Miss Paltrow – who split from Coldplay’s Chris Martin earlier this year – heads to Tracie Martyn for facials when she is in New York. She thinks nothing of paying almost £1,500 a year for microdermabrasion, electronic muscle stimulation and oxygen-mist treatment.

When Miss Paltrow is back in Los Angeles, she reportedly visits Sonya Dakar once a week, and is believed to enjoy her apple stem cell facial – at around £300 a session or £12,000 a year.

Hair salon treatments and trims are estimated to cost Miss Paltrow around £6,000 a year. Before she invested in a chain of blow-dry bars this year, she was also paying for weekly blow drys, which were thought to cost her almost £100 each – or around £5,000 a year. For personal appearances, Miss Paltrow will often have her own hairstylist and make-up artist. The annual bill for both is estimated at £120,000 – although their services will often be paid for by film companies if she is promoting a movie.

There is one area, however, where Miss Paltrow saves money – she part-owns the Tracy Anderson gym chain so can do her five two-hour workouts for free every week. Last night a source said: ‘In the past few years Gwyneth Paltrow created a career based on being an inspiration through her GOOP website – she’s not just an actress any more.

‘Part of what’s on her shoulders now is added pressure to look good. After all, who’s going to take advice from her if she doesn’t. Looking good is part of her business plan.’ A spokesman for Miss Paltrow declined to comment.
