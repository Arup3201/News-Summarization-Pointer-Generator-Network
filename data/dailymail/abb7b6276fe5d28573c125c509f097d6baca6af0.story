England football fans are clamouring to book a break in Kiev this weekend after the national team secured a place in the Euro 2012 quarter-finals.

Interest in flights to the Ukraine capital surged yesterday as fans' low expectations were turned around after England won its group stage of the tournament.

Fans swamped travel websites to secure their place in the Olympic Stadium when England take on Italy on Sunday.

Website CheapFlights reported an 800 per cent increase in inquiries for flights in the three hours before, during and after England's win over Ukraine on Tuesday.

Some optimistic fans are already looking
ahead to a possible showdown with Germany, assuming that team beats 
Greece in the quarter-finals, in Warsaw next Thursday.

Those that are already in the host nations, meanwhile, are making last minute plans to remain in the countries for 
at least another six days.

The cheapest flights available from London to Kiev - for 
just under £400 - were those going via other 
European cities with a stopover.

England's victory over Ukraine on Tuesday was watched by 18.5million people on ITV1, the biggest viewing figure of the year so far.

The final match of the group stage of Euro 2012 eclipsed the 17million who tuned in to watch the Diamond Jubilee concert earlier this month.

The BBC will now be hoping to set a new 2012 record when it airs England's quarter-final match against Italy on Sunday.

The cheapest direct London-Kiev 
flight was £577, going out with Alitalia on June 23, the day before the 
game, and returning with KLM on June 25, the day after the game.

Other direct flights available on the same dates were £590 with Luthansa and Austrian Airlines.

The cheapest direct flight landing on the day of the game, June 24, was £540 with Swissair.

But for those fans willing to spend 
up to 18 hours travelling, a £394 flight with a stopover and long wait in
the airport lounge at Paris was available via flight comparison website Skyscanner.

And the Football 
Association's official licensed tour operator Thomson Sport yesterday 
chartered an extra plane for its £649 per person 24-hour trip for the 
quarter-final after the package sold out.

Football's most powerful man Sepp Blatter has demanded goal-line technology be introduced after Ukraine's heartache against England.

The co-hosts were denied an equaliser in Tuesday's crunch Group D decider that ultimately saw them crash out of Euro 2012.

Ghost goal: John Terry kicks away a ball destined for the back of the net during England's game against Ukraine on Tuesday. Replays proved Marko Devic's shot crossed the line

John Terry hooked clear a shot from Marko Devic, who was in an offside position when he received the ball, in the 62nd minute but replays showed the ball was clearly over the line.

Fifa president Blatter tweeted yesterday: 'After last night’s match #GLT is no longer an alternative but a necessity.'

Blatter hopes to convince the game's rule-makers - the International Football Association Board - to give technology the green light.

He became a convert to goal-line technology after Frank Lampard was denied a legitimate goal in England's 2010 World Cup defeat to Germany.

That failed to convince Uefa president Michel Platini - the favourite to succeed Blatter as the most powerful man in world football - who remained wedded to his belief additional assistant referees behind each goal was the best way forward.

But this package did not come with a match ticket, so fans had to find one of those on their own. It did include the cost of return flights and transfers between the airport and stadium/

Skyscanner reported a massive surge in flight searches to Ukraine 
late on Tuesday night as Wayne Rooney fired England into the quarter-finals.

Overall searches on the day of the big
match against Poland were yesterday up 120 per cent compared to the day before, with 
flight searches doubling between 8pm and 10pm as expectation levels 
soared.

England fans yesterday swamped Uefa's official website to buy tickets for the quarter-final for as little as £33.

Category 3 and restricted view 
tickets for the Olympic Stadium in Kiev were available for 40 euros, 
with the superior category 2 seats selling for 80 Euros. There are no 
category one tickets available for sale.

He's back! The moment Wayne Rooney scored the only goal during England's last group match against Ukraine

A bottle of hair gel spray was today revealed to be England's secret good luck charm.

Wayne Rooney was apparently wearing the 'Ultra Strong Rock & Hold' Shockwaves product when he scored the winner against Ukraine on Tuesday.

And, according to The Sun, at least two other England players -  Andy Carroll and Jordan Henderson - are now using the gel in a bid to give their performances, and hair, some edge.

After scoring Tuesday's header against Ukraine, Rooney 'air-sprayed' his head during his celebrations.

The balding striker, of course, recently underwent a £30,000 hair transplant operation.

Fans had to register personal details
to open a personal account on the Uefa site to buy the tickets for the 
England v Italy game on Sunday.

At some stages the website became so 
heavy with online 'traffic' that the purchasing process froze as fans 
tried to buy the tickets.

One desperate England fan messaged 
online: 'Hi - has anyone been successful in buying tickets for the Italy
game via the UEFA Euro 2012 Ticket Portal? I can't get past the checkout stage.'

The tickets can only be collected in person in Kiev.

The England team yesterday enjoyed a day-off following their victory over Ukraine.

Many of the players handed out goodie bags to fans waiting outside their hotel in Krakow, Poland.

Jermain Defoe, 29, flew home to carry the coffin of his father Jimmy, 47, who died last week from throat cancer. He is expected to return to the squad today.
