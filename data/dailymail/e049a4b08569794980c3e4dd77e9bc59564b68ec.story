One of the British twin sisters who have travelled to Syria to become jihadi brides was caught looking at an extremist-linked image on her school computer six months before she fled the country, it has emerged.

Salma Halane, 17, downloaded a photograph of ISIS fighters in December 2013, using a computer at Connell Sixth Form College in Manchester.

When teachers found out, she told them she was trying to find her brother who had gone to Syria.

Six months later, Salma and her twin sister Zahra fled to the war-torn country, where they are believed to have married jihadist fighters from the bloodthirsty terror group.

The ISIS-related photograph which Salma viewed online was spotted by teachers when they were reviewing pupils' internet usage.

The school says that she was twice spoken to by staff about the picture, and advised to talk to her family about her worries over her brother, while teachers subsequently discussed the issue with her parents.

However, staff did not  tell the police of any concerns about the girl.

After the twins disappeared in June last year, the school handed all their internet browsing records over to anti-terrorism investigators to help them track Salma and Zahra down.

A spokesman for Bright Futures Educational Trust, which runs the college, said there was no reason not to believe Salma's explanation for why she was viewing the image.

She added: 'As part of the college's daily routine we review all internet browsing records. We promptly challenge students on anything that stands out during that review.

'In December 2013 we discovered that Salma Halane had viewed an image on a mainstream news website in the hope of spotting her missing brother. Our priority was her emotional wellbeing, and we recommended she speak to her mother about her concern for her brother and the college followed this up.

'Once it became clear that the girls had travelled to Syria, we handed over all computer records to the Counter Terrorism Unit (CTU). These were reviewed and nothing was discovered that caused them concern.'

An education source told the Manchester Evening News that the school should have done more to intervene after they saw that Salma had been looking at terror-related content online.

'I have no doubt whatsoever that if someone at the college had followed this up with Salma, she would still be in this country,' the source said. 'I think there should have been a real concern that she was becoming radicalised.'

Salma and Zahra were among the first pupils at Connell Sixth Form College, which opened as a State-funded free school in September 2013.

The twin girls, from the Manchester suburb of Chorlton, had 28 GCSEs between them and were hoping to become doctors before they ran away to join ISIS.

Their parents tried to travel to Syria to bring the girls back home, but were unable to persuade them to leave the war zone.

A number of British schoolgirls are believed to have left the country to become jihadi brides - last month, three teenagers from East London abandoned their families and travelled to Syria.
