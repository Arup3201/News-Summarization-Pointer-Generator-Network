Blunder: The charity have come under fire for handing out free cigarettes

A taxpayer-funded charity has sparked outrage by giving away free cigarettes as part of an anti-smoking campaign.

Tobacco Free Futures sent out packs to highlight how cigarette packaging can lead children to become addicted to smoking.

The Merseyside-based charity’s strategy has been blasted by politicians for being 'irresponsible'.

Councillor Rosie Jolly, Liverpool council Liberal Democrat shadow cabinet member for children’s services, said: 'I think this sends out mixed messages, and it’s completely contradictory to what is supposed to be being achieved.

'The whole point is to make cigarettes less visible and attractive to children, and here we are doing something that completely contradicts that.'

The charity defended its decision, saying they had only sent packs out to a few people in the North West media to draw attention to the dangers of smoking to influential people, including MPs.

Each pack costs £20 to send out - and they were sent to around 20 media outlets.

In
a statement, a Tobacco Free Futures spokesperson said: 'It is important
to Tobacco Free Futures that people with influence, such as journalists
and MPs, have the opportunity to see how brightly coloured and super 
slim cigarettes are being used alongside packaging to hook young women 
into a deadly addiction that kills one in two lifelong customers.'

Free cigarettes: Andrea Crossfield, Director of Tobacco Free Futures

Andrea Crossfield, Director of Tobacco Free Futures said: 'The tobacco industry spends a lot of time and money targeting young people because they have potential to be customers for life.

'The introduction of plain, standardised packaging would mean a victory for our children and a defeat for the tobacco industry, who have described the pack as their ‘silent salesman’.

'We want people to support the 
introduction of plain, standardised packaging for tobacco products as a 
measure to prevent children and young people from taking up smoking, and
a lifetime of addiction.'

They denied that they were giving out free cigarettes as part of the campaign.

A
spokesperson added: 'They were sent purely to help inform approximately
20 adult health journalists in the North West about how the tobacco 
industry targets young people through packaging, cigarette shape and 
colour.

'We also sent a plain, standardised pack as well as key facts about the recent government consultation.

Campaign: Tobacco Free Futures are leading a drive to remove the branding from cigarette packets in an attempt to make them less desirable

'We clearly stated in our letter that accompanied these cigarettes they were not for consumption.'

The article sparked outrage with Liberal Democrat shadow cabinet member for children’s services who claimed the campaigners actions were 'irresponsible'.

But Tobacco Free Futures insists that no packets were sent to children and their bid raise awareness of the dangers of smoking and advertising has been successful.

The spokesman added: 'Sending packets cost us about £360 yet has helped secure thousands of pounds worth of positive media coverage for the campaign to introduce plain, standardised packaging.

'Of course we don’t usually condone spending money on tobacco but in this unique instance the end justified the means.'
