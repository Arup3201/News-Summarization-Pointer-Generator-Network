They may look like the creations of an abstract artist - but these intricate paintings are in fact the work of elephants.

Using just their trunks, the pachyderm Picassos, based at Maesa Elephant Camp in the North of Thailand, craft artworks depicting trees and landscapes.

The intelligent creatures wow tourists who flock to watch them paint each week, with the paintings then being sold for up to 3,000baht (£58).

Artistic sensibilities: While some of the elephants paint dots, other prefer to draw lines 

Ten elephants produce the stunning floral and tree-inspired artworks unaided, with the only human influence being when the mahouts replenish the paint.

The sanctuary's website states: 'Initially, the calves were reluctant to pick up a paint brush and it took more than a month of persistence before the would-be artists became adept at simply holding the brush in their trunks.

'The next step for the mahouts was to train them to actually put paint onto paper. 

'One of our pachyderm prodigies successfully painted dots, while the other three chose to paint beautiful lines.'

When completed, the paintings often have a floral motif or depict a colourful tree 

It may be hard to believe, but these paintings sell for an average of £58 per piece

These paintings are created without any human help, aside from the keepers replenishing the paints
