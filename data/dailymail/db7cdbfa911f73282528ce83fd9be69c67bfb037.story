NYPD officers have been warned to 'use common sense' when posting on Twitter during their first class on using social media

New York police officers are being sent to classes on how to use social media after a series of high-profile Twitter gaffes.

NYPD officers were handed a memo which read 'USE COMMON SENSE' on their first day of classes at John Jay College in Manhattan, according to a source.

The move comes after Captain Thomas Harnisch was reprimanded for insensitive tweets about a woman who was hit by a train, and a publicity campaign using the hashtag 'myNYPD' was mocked.

Cops are being warned not to write off-the-cuff remarks and instead stick to posting wanted posters, along with information on crime stats and road closures.

Other safe topics include praising community groups, warning of an accident-prone section of road, or posting images of 'cop of the month', according to the New York Post.

The training comes after Harlem cop Capt. Thomas Harnisch was forced to apologise after tweeting about a woman who fell on to subway tracks while using her iPad.

Writing to Transport Alternatives, a safe-streets advocacy group, using the official precinct account, Capt. Harnisch said: 'Let me guess, driver's fault right?'

After being criticised for his message, Harnish responded: 'Isn’t that exactly what you do? Seize on a tragedy and assign culpability having no facts?'

He was later forced to apologise on the same account, saying his messages had been 'unprofessional and insensitive'. 

A publicity campaign for the police department, in which Twitter users were encouraged to post positive images of the police along with the tag 'myNYPD', also went badly wrong.

The feed was instead bombarded with images of alleged police brutality, violent protests and controversial arrests.

Recent tweets on the NYPD page include an announcement about a free schools programme, and a picture of a gun confiscated from a shooting suspect.
