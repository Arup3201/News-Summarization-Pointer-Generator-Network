In ZombiU, it's not about if you die, but when.

Against the odds and hounded by hordes of the undead, you're thrown into a zombie-infested London, and must do anything you can to escape in one piece.

Along the way you're helped by a man called the Prepper, who sends you on various skirmishes from hacking CCTV cameras to retrieving essential survival kit.

Running rampant: Some of London's most iconic landmarks have been infested by the undead

Thankfully, this rather unoriginal plot is made all the more unique by its masterful execution.Once your character is killed, for example, they are no longer playable and you take control of another survivor. 

Locked up in a safe room, you then have to run back to the spot and finish off your former character (who is now a zombie) to retrieve all your gear.

The mechanic works brilliantly. You're responsible for a life, rather than just a generic bot. While the lack of dialogue is perhaps a missed opportunity in a game of this nature, you still become incredibly attached to your character.

There's a sense of complete isolation and vulnerability throughout. Whether that's walking through the ghostly corridors of a once thriving school, or curling up in your safe house's bed as the cries of the undead echo through the tunnels.

It's a shame, then, that there's not as much freedom in the level design as there should be. They often involve walking through samey, claustrophobic corridors while the more open areas have clear boundaries - defined by a vehicle pile-up or a fence.

Watch your step: Often, the Underground provides a safe haven. But getting there is another problem

That being said, there are still plenty of areas to unlock and explore, so you can get a sense of your surroundings and find quick exit points to safe areas.

The zombies themselves are wonderfully realised, too. They pose no threat by themselves, but in a pack, they're deadly - placing a huge emphasis on tactics.

Often running in all guns blazing results in a quick, and brutal death. But throwing a flare, instead, can create a brief distraction, long enough to run past a horde unscathed.

It's these kind of decisions that make ZombiU such a tense experience, made more so by the intuitive controls.

The WiiU GamePad has a number of functions, serving as a backpack, map and scanner. At any time during the game you can access your backpack and equip supplies you've amassed from your travels.

Gruesome: The Wii U is capable of brilliant detail. Zombies rarely look the same and boast hauntingly realistic tissue damage. They are also drawn to sound and light, so you may want to keep your pistol holstered

When you use it, you're forced to take your eyes away from the main screen (which shifts into a third-person perspective) - leaving you vulnerable to attacks.

This instills a sense of urgency which is lacking in many horror games - often choosing to pause the action and provide a brief safe haven.

To use the scanner, simply go into a room and tag items of interest. These then appear on the map. There's even a button that lets out a brief pulse, showing you where there are moving objects - reminiscent of the motion tracker in the Aliens films.

This is crucial given the fact that enemies are randomly placed. You'll never go into an area and find zombies lurking in exactly the same areas.

Combat is hauntingly realistic. Ammo is sparse, so missing the target has serious consequences. But most of the time, you'll stick with melee weapons, such as the baseball bat.

Too close for comfort: On their own, zombies are easy to kill (again). In a pack, though, it's a different story

Although suffering from minor (and expected) launch title hiccups, such as clipping and bland textures, ZombiU is a remarkable artistic achievement.

Amidst the death are cues of the living world that existed before it. Venture through apartments and you'll see photos, newspapers - intricate details that hammer home the situation, and adding a further emotive incentive to escape alive.

But this is adventure you won't want to leave behind, and one that deserves its place among the best horror games ever made.
