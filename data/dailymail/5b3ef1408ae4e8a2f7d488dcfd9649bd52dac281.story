The husband of Alice Gruppioni, the Italian newlywed killed on the boardwalk at Venice Beach, kissed her coffin one final time as she was taken away to be laid to rest in her hometown of Bologna, Italy, on Thursday.

Gruppioni, 32, was killed when a crazed driver mowed down dozens of pedestrians in Los Angeles last Saturday.

She and husband Christian Casadei were in L.A. as part of their honeymoon after only getting married on July 20.

Suspect Nathan Campbell, 38, pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to one count of murder, 16 counts of assault with a deadly weapon and 17 counts of hit-and-run.

He could face life in prison if convicted and remains jailed on $1.48 million bail.

Gruppioni was rushed to hospital after the 6pm crash but died a few hours later of her injuries, with her husband by her side.

The daughter of a prominent Italian businessman, she was buried on Thursday in the same church in the northern town of Bologna where she was married last month.

Father Paolo Rubbi, the priest who conducted ceremony at the local church two blocks from the family home, said the whole town was devastated.

‘She was the image of joy and enthusiasm and was very unpretentious. She had an immediate rapport with everyone, today everyone is in tears. Her marriage was too brief on this earth.’

The victim’s younger sister Carlotta described Alice - the middle one of three girls - as ‘the diamond of our lives.’

‘Everybody loved her and she loved everybody. When you lose a diamond, you lose everything,’ she told The Telegraph.

A family friend described Alice as a very generous person.

‘Alice was really special. She was 
always helping her neighbors and she invited everyone to her wedding, 
even the shopkeepers of the town. Rich and poor, for her it made no 
difference,’ said Silvano Scandellari.

The victim's husband Casadei, who received minor injuries, kissed his wife’s coffin on Thursday as it was led away to be buried.

In
the aftermath of Saturday’s crash he had talked with disbelief about 
how the couple's happiness had been so suddenly shattered.

'We
were walking, we were happy, we were on our honeymoon and everything, 
and suddenly everything changed,' Casadei said, according to Giuseppe 
Perrone, the Italian consul general in L.A., who accompanied Casadei to 
the hospital.

'I still can't believe it, and I don't even remember exactly what happened. It's all very confusing.'

Perrone described Casadei as 'destroyed and in disbelief'.

Gruppioni
and Casadei were in California for their honeymoon, which was to be a trip 
across the U.S.

'It's a tragedy. There's nothing more to say,' Casadei told the Italian news agency ANSA.

Prosecutors
contend that Campbell deliberately maneuvered around a barrier and 
drove though the crowds. His attorney Philip Dube called it "a horrible 
accident."

On Saturday 
morning, Campbell - who struggled with alcohol abuse in the past - had 
an appointment at the day-labor center 15 miles away in Malibu.

He told the manager of the Malibu Community Labor Exchange that he had purchased a car in Colorado and was living in it.

Campbell
has a history of run-ins with the law in several states in including a 
conviction for driving with alcohol, although Dube told reporters there 
was no indication that drugs or alcohol were involved in the weekend 
incident.
