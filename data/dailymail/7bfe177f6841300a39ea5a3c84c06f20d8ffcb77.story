Arrested: Claude Alexander Allen III, 20, has admitted to a disagreement with Michael Phillip Harvey, 25, over 'controlled dangerous substances sales'

The son of a former aide to President
George W. Bush killed his friend with a hatchet due to a drug dispute, 
according to police documents released on Tuesday.

Claude Alexander Allen III, 20, was arrested last Friday by police after they found the body of Michael Phillip Harvey, 25, in the woods near the Allen family home in Gaithersburg, Maryland.

The
student called 911 around midnight and told police that he killed an 
intruder after he tried to break in. But authorities determined it 
wasn't a break-in and that the younger Allen knew Harvey.

According to documents made public when Allen went before the Montgomery County District 
Court 
for a bond review, he admitted to having a disagreement with Harvey 
over 'controlled dangerous substances sales,' reports the Washington 
Post.

A District Court judge has ordered that Allen be held without bond.

Harvey's body was found around 75 yards behind the house but police believe an altercation occurred and the attack started in a two-car garage.

Montgomery County Police Capt. Jim Daly told the Post it was not clear if the argument moved to the woods or if the man's 
body was dragged there after he died.

When
police arrived at the large white-brick home, Allen was waiting for 
them but that his parents were not home at the time of the attack. They 
found the hatchet in a garbage can.

Another man had been there, but left 
by the time police arrived. They tracked him down and questioned him but
he is not a suspect, Daly told the Post.

The witness said that he saw Allen emerge from the garage of the home with blood on his hands.Â 

Allen told his friend he 'got the person' who was robbing his home and asked for help moving the body out of the house.

Fearing for his own safety, the 
witness helped Allen move the body of his friend to a trash can and then
fled when Allen went to another area of the home.

Two years ago, Mr. Allen was placed on probation after he pleaded guilty to possession of drug paraphernalia.

A neighbor told the Post that Allen, a star soccer and rugby player, had just returned home from college in the state.

Legal issues: The alleged murderer's father (seen left of then-President Bush in 2005) left the administration when he was caught shoplifting $5,000-worth of merchandise

It is not the family's first brush with the law; Claude Alexander Allen, now 52, was arrested in 2006 for allegedly claiming refunds for more than $5,000 worth of merchandise he did not buy.

The thefts occurred at 25 stores from 2005 until 2006 even though his annual salary as an adviser was $160,000

'I was shocked and my first reaction was one of disappointment, deep disappointment - if it's true - that we were not fully informed,' Bush said at the time.

Allen pleaded guilty to theft on August 4, 2006.

He claimed that in the months leading up to the thefts, he had suffered huge stress and sleep deprivation. His wife cited Hurricane Katrina and his subsequent work as one of the causes of stress.

Allen was ordered to reimburse Target 
for the $850 of stolen merchandise. He also paid a $500 fine and agreed 
to perform 40 hours of community service.

A trained lawyer, he was a deputy secretary in the Department of Health and Human Services and nominated to a federal appeals court seat in 2003.

He joined the White House during Bush's second term but abruptly resigned from the role shortly after being charged with misdemeanor theft.

In September 2011, the D.C. Court of Appeals suspended his license to practice law in D.C. fora year, following suspensions in Virginia and Pennsylvania.

His son is one of four children with his wife, Jannese.
