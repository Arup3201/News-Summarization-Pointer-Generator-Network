A shark has been spotted swimming near a dead 10-metre whale carcass which washed up on a West Australian beach.

The dead humpback was spotted by a member of the public at the remote Buffalo Beach near Australind on Saturday.

The Department of Fisheries confirmed that at least one shark had been sighted swimming near it on Wednesday, and are urging people to steer clear of the back beach which is only accessible by four-wheel drive.

Stay clear: A shark has been spotted swimming in the shallows of Buffalo Beach, WA, where a dead whale washed up on Saturday

The dead carcass had a number of shark-bite marks on its body and people are being warned not to go anywhere near it

Rotting whale carcasses, apart from attracting deadly sharks, also pose a significant health risk to humans. Authorities are still trying to figure out the best method for its removal. 

A Parks and Wildlife spokeswoman said the carcass has several bite marks, possibly from a shark, and requested people not to access the beach while the whale is still there.

Signs warning people to stay out of the water and away from the whale have been placed on the beach. In April, a humpback whale carcass that washed up on an Albany beach, WA attracted several sharks, and last month another young humpback carcass was discovered at a beach on Perth's northern fringe.
