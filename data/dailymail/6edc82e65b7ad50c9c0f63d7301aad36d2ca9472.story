This is the moment a bargain hunting couple discovered their £2 figurine sold for £4,250 at auction on the television programme Flog It.

Their shocked faces, captured on camera in the BBC programme, show their joy and disbelief as the figurine goes under the hammer to make them a £4,248 profit.

David and Helen Lambert paid for the unusual blue Royal Doulton figurine they spotted at a car boot sale in Stockport with a £2 coin.

They took it to valuers from BBC's Flog It programme and were thrilled to discover they had bought a 1922 'Spook' figure believed to be worth around £300.

The base reveals the Royal Doulton stamp with the date 1922.

Flog It returns to televisions this week and is in its twelfth series starting at 4.30pm on BBC1.

Auctioneer, John Cook, who sold the ornament at Gerrard's Auctions, Lytham St Anne's, was surprised to see its blue colour and believes it is a prototype glaze.

He thinks the figure could be the only one in this colour and this is why the hammer fell much higher than expected.

The lucky couple from Colne, Lancashire, head to car boot sales in search of a bargain most weekends but have decided to save the cash they raised from selling the ornament.

Helen said: "When David first came home with the piece I really didn't like it.

'The auction was just unbelievable and I was shocked at the starting price let alone what it actually sold for.

'After the sale I rang David to tell him what had happened. He couldn't believe it and I was shaking when I was telling him so I had to get the lady from the auction room to confirm the news for him.

'I think this sort of thing is a only once in a lifetime thing to happen to people and we don't expect it to happen again.'
