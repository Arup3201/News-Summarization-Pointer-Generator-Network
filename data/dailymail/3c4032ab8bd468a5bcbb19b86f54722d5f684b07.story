The art teacher, Lei Mingxing, beat one child so badly he fractured his skull. 

Four pupils all aged under seven were found crying and covered in blood after being beaten by the cruel art teacher at their school in Ankanh, Shaanxi Province 

One of the children was beaten so horrifically the teacher fractured his skull. The school's head teacher described the event as 'totally shocking' 

Head teacher Wang Qin said: 'I walked past his office and heard crying. 

'As I went in I saw the pupils on the floor, very distressed and covered in blood.'

'We've no idea what's behind this. He has always been a very good teacher. We are a very small school, only 22 pupils, so this is totally shocking.

'He has been a good teacher for many years and has never shown any sign of violence before.

'We are very concerned for the children and will be talking to all of them to see what was behind this.'
