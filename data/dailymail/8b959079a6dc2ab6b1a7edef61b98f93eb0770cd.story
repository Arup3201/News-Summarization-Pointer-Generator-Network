Pele remains in intensive care after undergoing an operation on his kidney but his condition has improved, say doctors treating the football legend.

The 74-year-old has stopped dialysis in the Albert Einstein Hospital in Sao Paolo and is now 'lucid and stable', according to medics. 

The former footballer was hospitalised on Monday after being diagnosed with a urinary tract infection following a surgery to remove kidney stones earlier this month. 

Pele remains in intensive care but is said to be showing signs of a good recovery after being admitted to hospital with a urinary tract infection having undergone surgery on his kidney earlier this month

Last week the hospital sparked concern for the athlete's health after revealing he had been admitted to an intensive care unit. 

But he has since said to have shown good signs of recovery and is responding well to antibiotics.

Yesterday, his son Edinho said his father was 'very upbeat' and that he expected to be released from hospital by the end of next week. 

While doctors have stopped administering dialysis, they have not ruled out starting the treatment again if Pele's necessary.

'The renal support treatment was suspended until tomorrow, when its necessity will be re-evaluated,' Albert Einstein Hospital said in a statement. 

At one point in his sporting career the footballer had to have a kidney removed after breaking a rib during a match, though this is not thought to be affecting his health today.  

Brazilian and international media have been closely monitoring Pele’s condition since last week, when the hospital said he became unstable and was transferred to an intensive care unit.

On Friday the former footballer thanked his 1.93million Twitter followers for their support in his health battle

Earlier this week, the 74-year-old took to Twitter to share his gratitude for fans' well wishes and put an end to speculation on his health. 

'I am blessed to receive your love and support, and thank God this is nothing serious,' he told 1.93million followers. 

'I am looking forward to spending the upcoming holidays with my family, and will start the new year with renewed health, with many international trips already planned! Thank you!' he said. 

In the days beforehand, he dismissed rumours of his condition worsening, adding he needed to recover 'in peace'. 

After being released from hospital having undergone surgery for kidney stones on November 13, he thanked his followers for their support.  

'Thank you to all of my fans, who sent in their concerns and well wishes to me from around the world. 

'I dedicate everything I have to you! I am doing well, I will recover just fine.' 

The football legend led Brazil to World Cup victory more than once throughout his long sporting career
