Robbie Fowler has questioned whether Louis van Gaal is the right man to lead Manchester United, saying that he believes he is 'too old' for the job.

The former striker, who scored six goals for Liverpool against United during his Anfield career, believes that Ryan Giggs should be given the job instead.

But it does seem likely that Van Gaal will be bringing in the Welshman, who took charge of their final four games of the season, as his assistant.VIDEO: Scroll down for Ferdinand: Van Gaal's strong personality a good fit for United

Help the aged: Robbie Fowler believes that Louis van Gaal is too old to manage Manchester United

Rival: Fowler is a Liverpool legend, scoring six goals for them against United during his career

'I don’t know if Louis van Gaal is the right man for Manchester United,' he told the Alan Brazil Sports Breakfast show.

'He’s had his time. It might sound silly, but he’s too old.

'You can’t argue with his credentials and what he’s achieved, but Man United should have gone for a young, vibrant manager.

'The board might have said to Van Gaal he needs to get Giggs ready to take over in a few years. That was one of the stumbling blocks early on. Whoever came in would have to take him on to the staff.

'But they should have just given the job to Ryan. It’s one of the biggest jobs in football but Giggs knows the club, he knows what’s expected and everything about the club.

'They should have appointed him and brought in a superb number two to help him along the way.

'I’m not saying that as a Liverpool fan who thinks, ‘let’s get the young manager in and hope that he fails’. I want young British managers to do very well because it’s good for British football as a whole.

'You don’t have the career he’s had at Manchester United if you’re a bit of a wimp. He knows what he’s doing and they should have gone done that route.'
