A burglar returned money he stole from a children's fundraising cup to the football academy he took it from - with added interest.

Darren Green, 30, went to Top Corner Sports in Middlesbrough, which is owned and managed by retired footballer Jamie Pollock, to watch his nephew play football when he took the cash.

A court heard Green, who has committed 41 offences, seized his chance to steal in a 'moment of madness' after the building was made accessible to the public during the football tournament.

Darren Green, 30, admitted stealing the cash from Top Corner Sports in Middlesbrough when he went to watch his nephew play football

He went into the closed bar area and stole a black cash box and a cup full of money for children's fundraising, according to the Evening Gazette.

Teeside Magistrates' Court heard that when he was challenged by a suspicious witness on the evening of November 11, he said he worked at a nearby office. 

But he later confessed he had taken the money to his manager and police and paid back £150 to the football academy, which is home to five children's football teams.

Green, from Teesville in Middlesbrough, admitted the burglary - his 41st crime on record and his first since 2011.

Dominic Tate, defending, said: 'Clearly he's made a massive mistake. He recognises the error of his ways. He realised that almost immediately.

'He went back later that night to try and rectify things. However it was the following day he then returned and repaid the money, with additional money also.

'He understands that he shouldn't have done this. Essentially it was a moment of madness.

'His original intention was to see his nephew play football. He saw the cash and unfortunately took the incorrect decision to take that money.'

Mr Tate told the court that Green, whose pregnant girlfriend sat in the public gallery, was currently working as an Avon representative and a volunteer for a local garage.

He explained that the 30-year-old had made efforts to turn his life around and had shown extreme remorse.

Robert Birch, chairing a bench of three magistrates, told Green that while he accepts his deep regret and the fact he has repaid the money, he had committed a 'crime against the community'. 

Green was given a one-year community order with supervision and must carry out 60 hours of unpaid work, and ordered to pay £100 costs.

Following the sentencing, Top Corner Sports said it was delighted the money had been returned.

A spokesman said: 'We're really pleased that the money was returned.

'All money raised by the children of Top Corner Sports is re-invested and put back into this community initiative and used to support local children of all ages and abilities to improve their football skills, but more so to build friendships for the future.

'We would like to thank those involved in bringing this sad incident to a closure and the monies can now be returned and used by the children.'
