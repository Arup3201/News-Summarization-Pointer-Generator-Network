A real estate businessman was arrested and charged with the murder of his wife, who has been missing since Wednesday.

Peter Gregory Chadwick, 48, is now being held on $1.5million bond for the alleged death of his 46-year-old wife, Quee Chadwick.

Police found signs of foul play at the couple’s house within a gated community in Newport Beach, but have not yet found the body. They also declined to say how they knew the stay-at-home mother was dead.

Officers first visited the couple’s multimillion-dollar home after Quee, known as QC, had failed to pick up their three children from school Wednesday afternoon.

According to the Daily Pilot, next-door-neighbour Yulianna Nikulina told authorities that she heard Quee screaming around 7am on Monday, but said that was the only altercation she ever heard coming from the family’s expansive home.

She told the paper that Chadwick was a ‘nice man’ with ‘nothing wrong.’ She added: ‘I can only tell you good things about this couple.’

Ms Nikulina said that the couple’s children – all boys – aged 8, 10, and 14, were also well-behaved.

She said that Chadwick worked on his real estate businesses from home, and that Quee was a stay-at-home mother who had emigrated to California from China.

Real estate site Trulia values homes in the exclusive community priced from $1.8million to $2.8million.

Foul play? Police said they found signs of distress within the home and are currently searching for the body of Quee

Newport Beach police spokeswoman Kathy Lowe said in a statement that on Thursday at around 5:30am, Chadwick called the San Diego police near the Mexican border at Tijuana.

He was driving his 2003 champagne-coloured Lexus SUV.

Ms Lowe said that police declined to specify why he called for help.

But it was at that point, Ms Lowe said, that police in Newport Beach took him into custody and charged him with suspicion of homicide.

Police in Newport Beach are now meticulously combing the areas Chadwick could have visited between his home and San Diego for his wife’s body.

They said that the couple’s children are in good care, but did not elaborate.

Neighbours of the Chadwicks did not immediately responded to MailOnline’s request for comment.
