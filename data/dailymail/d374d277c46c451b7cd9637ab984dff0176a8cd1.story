Experts have warned production in the world's best wine regions could fall by two thirds because of climate change.

There will be a sharp decline in wine production from Bordeaux, in France, Tuscany, Italy, and Napa Valley in California, by 2050, a study has said.

But the change will see a 'big push' into areas which had previously been thought of as unsuitable - such as Tasmania and China.

Wine grapes are known to be sensitive to changes in temperature, rain and sunshine.

Lee Hannah, a senior scientist at Conservation International and an author of the study said climate change will lead to a 'huge shakeup in the geographic distribution of wine production' because of big changes in regions enjoying the cool winters and hot dry summers that produce good grapes.

He told the Guardian: 'It will be harder and harder to grow those varieties that are currently growing in places in Europe.'

The findings are published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

The researchers used 17 different climate
models to ascertain the effects on nine major wine-producing areas.

Changing face of wine production: Map shows the change in suitability for wine production between now and 2050. Areas that are currently suitable for wine production but won't be in 2050 are red. Areas that are suitable at present and are still suitable in 2050 are green. Areas which will become suitable are light blue and dark blue

They used two different climate futures for 2050.

One assumed a 4.7C (8.5F) warming, the other a 2.5C increase.

The most drastic 
decline was predicted in Europe, where the scientists found a 85 per cent 
decrease in production in Bordeaux, Rhone and Tuscany.

In wine growing areas of Australia, there was a forecast 74 per cent drop, and California, a 70 per cent fall.

The scientists also predicted a sharp decline for wine growers in the Cape area of South Africa with falls of 55 per cent, and Chile's wine producers would expect losses of about 
40 per cent.

But the change in climate could see a boom in new world wine in new territory such as 
Tasmania and the 
hills of central China. 

However, Rebecca Shaw, a scientist for the Environmental Defence Fund and an author of the paper, warned the search for new wine country could unearth a host of new potential problems, as many of the areas being touted for production are home to endangered wildlife.

She said: 'Wine is going to be on the move in the future as will wildlife. This adaptation has the potential to threaten the survival of wildlife.'
