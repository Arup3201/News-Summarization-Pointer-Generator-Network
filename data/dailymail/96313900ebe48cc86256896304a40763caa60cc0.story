If you’re already struggling with your New Year plans to get fit, it may be because you’re listening to the wrong kind of music during your workout.

Sports psychologists from London have discovered that specific genres of music are best suited to specific types of exercise, and listening to the wrong kind of track could hinder your performance. 

They found that rap music provides the best beats per minute for stretching and running, while dance music is more suited to strength training.

Sports psychologists from London have discovered that specific genres of music are best suited to specific types of exercise, and listening to the wrong kind of track could hinder your performance.  They found that rap music provides the best beats per minute for running, pictured, for example

The team analysed 6.7 million Spotify
 playlists containing the word ‘workout’ in the title to compare the 
different beats per minute (bpm) and compile the ultimate playlist. 

A person’s typical stride rate while jogging or running is 150 to 190 strides per minute.

If these figures are halved it gives a
 range of 75 to 95 bpm – the beat range most commonly used in urban 
music, particularly rap.

Whereas pop is perfect for slower, 
more repetitive-type tasks, including aerobic warm up and cool down 
because many pop songs 'have regular rhythmic patterns.'

Dance music is best suited to 
strength and weight training because of its ‘fast, rhythmical, bass’.

Whereas rock music should be avoid 
during cardio and high-intensity workouts because the different changes 
in tempo can affect a person’s rhythm.

Pop music is best used during warm up and cool down, but rock music should be avoided during exercise due to frequent changes in tempo that can affect your rhythm.

The research was carried out by sports psychologist Dr Costas Karageorghis, the Music in Exercise and Sport Group at Brunel University in London and Spotify.

The team analysed 6.7 million Spotify playlists containing the word ‘workout’ in the title and compared the different beats per minute (bpm) to those used in certain workouts.

For example, a person’s typical stride rate while jogging or running is 150 to 190 strides per minute.  

If these figures are halved it gives a range of 75 to 95 bpm - the beat range found most commonly in urban music, particularly rap. 

Many of the lyrics in rap music also 'imbue the physical energy' best suited to running, explained the researchers.

Dance music is best suited to strength and weight training because its ‘fast, rhythmical, bass psyches people up before weight training sessions. 

Elsewhere, Dr Karageorghis said that for maximum effect, people should use songs that remind them of their adolescence and early adulthood to make them feel youthful and fit.

He said: ‘A suitably motivational playlist can help to 'colour' the symptoms of exercise-related fatigue, like breathlessness and a beating heart, in such a way that they are interpreted in a more positive manner. 

‘This means that at the point when your body is shouting stop, the music has the power to lift your mood and beckon you on.'

Celebrity trainer Joey Gonzalez added: 'During workouts, an hour-long mix of strength training and treadmill-based cardio intervals, we try to match our runs and exercises to the beat of our music. 

‘For example, timing the treadmill sprints to the chorus of a track with a great hook, or playing a slower song with bass for incline jogs, and even matching steady consistent beats for long endurance runs are all part of our strategy.’

Whereas rock music should be avoid during cardio and high-intensity workouts because the different changes in tempo can affect a person’s rhythm. 

Based on the findings, the researchers have compiled a playlist with song suggestions for cool down, aerobic warm up, varying levels of cardio intensity, strength training and cool down.
