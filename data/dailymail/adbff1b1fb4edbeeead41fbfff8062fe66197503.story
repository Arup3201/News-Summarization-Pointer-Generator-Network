An immigrant woman has captured the privileged life of her child, and the children of friends, in a new photo series. 

Eri Morita now lives in a safe and idyllic neighborhood in California, a far cry from her days roaming the industrial town in Tokyo she grew up in. 

And with her new series In the Beautiful Bubble, she captures just how picturesque and perfect suburban life is for children.

After growing up in Tokyo, Morita moved to New York City to study photography at International Center of Photography. 

From there she went on to shoot for the likes of Vogue, W, Seventeen, and Der Spiegel.

She traveled around the country before settling down, getting married, and having a daughter, who is featured in this new project.

The photos show the giant toys, the pools and Jacuzzi, the beautiful beach and even a hamster funeral.

They also show the children, often looking aloof and disinterested as they stare at the camera. 

The series was recently awarded the 6th JGS Annual Artist Award.

'As I raise my daughter in Southern California, I realized the environment she is growing up is nothing similar to my own childhood,' explains Morita.

'On the other hand, I see rows and rows of beautiful homes in Southern California. Nature here is serene and tranquil. 

'Children live in well protected environment. They are given almost anything they can think of. The housing boom made it possible for anyone to have a big home. Parents drive SUVs to drop kids off at school. 

'There are always houses being built on the land where there used to be coyotes and bobcats. 

'Where you live is who you are. I never believed this before I lived here but now I understand it.'
