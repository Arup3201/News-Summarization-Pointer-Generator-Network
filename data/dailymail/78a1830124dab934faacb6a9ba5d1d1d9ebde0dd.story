Lewis Hamilton has been warned that he could be sacked by Mercedes if his bitter feud with Nico Rosberg flares out of control again.

Speaking ahead of Sunday's Italian Grand Prix, Mercedes boss Toto Wolff said: ‘We would have to take decisions and take the consequences of having a different line-up.

‘If we are not able to manage the two of them following the Mercedes-Benz spirit then we need to admit that.’

Although Wolff did not name Hamilton, his position appears to be more vulnerable because Rosberg has already agreed a new contract with the team.

There is growing speculation that Hamilton has called off his contract talks while he sees how the season pans out. Mercedes have bent over backwards to support Hamilton, but Wolff’s comments show they are prepared to accept a breaking point in their relations with the British driver.

McLaren are willing to tempt Hamilton back to their fold, and await developments with an open cheque book at the ready. Sportsmail understands tentative talks have started between the two parties.

With Fernando Alonso having stated this week that he wants to see out his Ferrari contract, Hamilton is even more firmly in the thoughts of McLaren.

Fury: Toto Wolff was incandescent after Rosberg's collision with Hamilton. He described it as 'unacceptable'
