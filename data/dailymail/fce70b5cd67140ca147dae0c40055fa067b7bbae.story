Sunderland have re-signed Argentinian defender Santiago Vergini on a season-long loan deal.

The 26-year-old spent the second half of last season on loan at the Stadium of Light.

And the once-capped centre-back said: 'Firstly I'm very thankful to the club for giving me this opportunity. I am very happy to be here once again.

'I'm also very happy to see so many recognisable faces. 

'The challenge for me is to become part of this team, and offer all I can so we have a good season. 

'The feeling that I've had here at this club has been very good. It’s a big club.'

Vergini is Gus Poyet's sixth signing of the summer following the arrival of Jack Rodwell and Costel Pantilimon from champions Manchester City, Jordi Gomez, Billy Jones and Patrick van Aanholt.
