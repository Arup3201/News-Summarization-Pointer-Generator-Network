Roma want to agree a permanent deal in January for Newcastle United defender Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa after his impressive start to the season.

The 25-year-old failed to convince during his time at Newcastle where he often played at full-back but has been earning rave reviews at Roma and was man of the match in last weekend’s game against verona.

Manager Rudi Garcia has been playing Yanga-Mwiba in his preferred position of central defence and is keen to bring forward the original option which was to buy the France international at the end of the season.

Newcastle paid around £6.7million to Montpellier in January 2013 but may sell for £4million.

Yanga-Mbiwa has made 46 appearances in all competitions for the Magpies and has been capped three times by France.
