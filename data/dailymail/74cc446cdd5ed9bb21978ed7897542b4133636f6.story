A heavily-pregnant teenager on trial for the murder of her socialite mother claims she has no-one to defend her as her trial gets underway on the resort island of Bali.

Heather Mack, who is seven months' pregnant, and her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer, 21, are accused of killing Sheila von Wiese-Mack and then stuffing her body inside a suitcase. If convicted the pair could be killed by firing squad.

The 19-year-old reportedly made a desperate phone call to a US judge  because she had no Indonesian attorney to represent her.

In addition her US lawyer withdrew from the case over a 'breakdown in communication,' according to the Chicago Tribune.

Showing the strain: Pregnant Heather Mack, 19, reportedly made a desperate call to a US judge claiming she has no one to defend her

Co-defendent: Her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer is jointly charged with the murder of Sheila von Wiese-Mack

The pair have pleaded not guilty to premeditated murder and their cases are being tried separately in the Denpasar District Court in Bali.

As Mack's trial got underway, the strain was visible on her face as she followed proceedings through an Indonesian interpreter.

When the silver-coloured suitcase in which the folded body of Sheila Von-Wiese Mack is alleged to have been placed was shown to the three judges, it was revealed that her Indonesian lawyer had received only a part-payment from the trust fund.

Within hours, Mack's US civil attorney Anthony Scifo, filed a motion to voluntarily withdraw from her case, citing a 'substantial breakdown in communication,' the Tribune reported.

The court was shown the suitcase that Sheila von Wiese-Mack's body was allegedly found stuffed inside, along with a set of blood stained sheets

The paper said that in three phone calls, a woman claiming to be Mack, told a law clerk in the office of Cook County judge Neil Cohen she needed help. 

The judge had previously said she could use some of the money her murdered mother has left in a trust fund for her.

Mack reportedly said she had fired her attorneys and explained that she currently has no attorneys and doesn't know how to speak to the judge, the law clerk said in a written statement read to the Cook County court.

'She asked how she could get another attorney to represent her or to speak to the (Cook County) judge,' the Tribune reported the clerk as telling the court.

'I told her that I could not give her legal advice and the conversation ended.'

But in a third call, the woman claiming to be Mack 'mentioned that she was in Indonesia and has no money, no-one to call and no attorneys and doesn't know what to do.'

Bali lawyer Ary Soenardi said that he was still acting for her and was continuing to work on her defence.

A court spokesman in Bali said no notification had been given that he had removed himself from the case, which has been adjourned until next week.

It is then that the first of the prosecution witnesses will be called.

Among the witness will be staff from the St Regis Hotel - where the murder occurred - police and forensic experts.

Ahead of the start of the trial against her Mack revealed that she misses her socialite mother  'everyday' and loved her 'with all my heart.' 

She said she was petrified ahead of her trial, but that her fears were ‘more for my daughter than me,’ according to the Chicago Tribune.

If the young lovers are found guilty they will face a firing squad. 

'I loved my mom with all my heart and miss her every day,’ the newspaper reported Mack as saying.

She reportedly added that ‘If I allow myself to grieve whatsoever I’m in a complete state of depression.

‘The smile (seen in photos of her arriving at court) is actually a disguise I wear to survive here.’

But she said she was receiving help from ‘good Samaritans who helped to get her food and vitamins and her baby, Stella, named after Schaefer’s great-grandmother, was healthy.

Referring to the baby, she told the paper: ‘She’s healthy and it is completely safe here and (a) completely fair country.’ 

Mack also revealed that she believed her lawyer would prove her innocence and asked ‘that the public reserve judgment on my case until the judges passes his verdict.’

Earlier this week three judges rejected a last-ditch attempt by the Chicago couple's defence teams to have the case thrown out.

They had  claimed that there were 'inaccuracies' on the indictment and it should be annulled at the hearing in Denpasar. 

The pair were sent to the island's notorious Kerobokan Prison in December ahead of their trials.

They were arrested in August following the gruesome discovery of the badly beaten body of Mack's 62-year-old mother stuffed inside a suitcase that had been loaded into a taxi outside the luxury St Regis Hotel in Nusa Dua.

They were charged with premeditated murder, which carries the death penalty. 

Prosecutors have alleged that the couple sent text messages about their initial plan to disguise a murder as suicide on the beach. 

In their indictment, prosecutors alleged that the couple plotted the murder because von Wiese-Mack did not approve of their relationship and that Mack had once suggested that Schaefer hire someone to kill her mother for $50,000.

They further alleged that an argument over the hotel bill made Mack's mother angry and she scolded Schaefer, using a racial slur, and Schaefer then battered her with a fruit bowl handle.

Mack, who is seven months' pregnant, helped stuff her mother's body in the suitcase by sitting on it to enable Schaefer to close it, according to the indictment. 

They then hired a taxi and placed the suitcase in the trunk and told the driver they were going to check out of the hotel and would return, but never did, it was alleged.
