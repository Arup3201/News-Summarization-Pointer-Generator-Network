A Pakistani cricketer has missed a World Cup warm-up match after claiming he was woken up in his New Zealand hotel room by a ghost shaking his bed.

Haris Sohail was forced to move rooms after becoming convinced that a 'supernatural' presence was haunting him when he found his bed moving on Saturday night.

The cricketer, who is on tour with his national side in New Zealand, then spent the rest of the night in a coach's room at the Rydges Latimer hotel in Christchurch.

The next day, the 26-year-old all rounder was left out of the Pakistan team, who lost to a New Zealand President XI.

According to Pakistan team manager Naveed Akrama Cheema, Mr Sohail was 'visibly shaken' after the incident and called a member of the coaching staff.

However, he added that the player had been suffering from a fever at the time.

He explained: 'We think it was the fever that caused it (but) the player still believes his bed was shaken by something and it was a supernatural something.'

It comes after the cricketer tweeted on Sunday:'Allah always answers your duas'. A dua is a form of Muslim prayer.

One of his followers tweeted back: 'It's nice to hear that you recovered from that incident in New Zealand. May Allah protect you.'

While another replied: 'You've faced down Shaitaan (the devil), the Kiwis should be easy. Best wishes.'

Mr Sohail was reportedly unable to train for two days after the incident and only scored six when he returned for another warm up game today.

The hotel's management declined to comment on the incident, referring enquiries to Pakistan team officials.

But one member of staff told the New Zealand Herald: 'It's hard to believe. They [Pakistan management] told me it was only a nightmare.

'I spoke with a team physiotherapist and other people on the team.He [Sohail] didn't come to me but they wanted him to move rooms.

'He's been sleeping in another room for about two nights now.' 

The 4.5-star Rydges Latimer has been rebuilt since the 2011 earthquake that devastated Christchurch and claimed 185 lives.

There have been no overnight earthquakes recorded in Christchurch since the Pakistan team arrived.

But it is not the first time an international cricketer has complained of ghostly goings-on in the night.

Lumley Castle, pictured, looms in the background of Durham County Cricket Club's Riverside ground during last year's 4th Ashes test. In 2005 several members of the Australian cricket team complained of paranormal activity while staying at the hotel 

In 2005, several members of the Australian cricket team, including Shane Watson complained of paranormal activity at Lumley Castle hotel, which looms over Durham County Cricket Club's Riverside ground.

The 600-year-old castle is rumoured to be haunted by Lily, an aristocratic lady murdered in the 14th century.

While last year, England player Stuart Broad requested to move rooms at the Langham hotel in London after having trouble sleeping due to claims the the hotel was haunted.
