The father charged with murder after his toddler son died after he left him in his scorching hot car has been barred from attending his son’s funeral, it was revealed today.

Justin Ross Harris, 33, won’t be allowed to attend a planned service for 22-month-old Cooper in his home town of Tuscaloosa, Alabama on Saturday.

In many states, inmates are granted a temporary leave of absence – or furlough – on compassionate grounds to attend funerals.

Barred: Justin Harris - pictured with wife Leanna and son Cooper -  won't be able to attend the church service for his dead son on Saturday as he is in custody on a felony murder charge

Anger: The news will come as a blow to the 11,000 people who have signed a petition for the charges to be dropped against Harris, who they claim the grief of losing Cooper is punishment enough

Pre-trial inmates - such as Harris - can request permission under a special court order but Cobb County in Georgia where the death occurred does not grant them under any circumstances.

Cobb County Sheriff’s Department, which is in charge of Harris’ detention, told MailOnline: ‘We do not transport inmates to funeral services, that’s it, that’s our policy.’

The news will come as a blow to Harris who is awaiting trial accused of felony murder and second degree child cruelty.

It will also anger more than 11,000 people who have signed a petition pleading with the Cobb County District Attorney’s office to 'drop the murder charges,' believing they are too harsh for a caring father who has been punished enough with the loss of his child.

The funeral is to be held on Saturday at 1pm at the University Church of Christ in Tuscaloosa.

A private family burial is also being planned in Tuscaloosa after the service.

Yesterday when approached by the MailOnline, baby Cooper’s grandmother – the mother of Harris’ wife Leanna – said the family was still ‘grieving’.

She simply said: ‘Sorry we have been told not to say anything, we are still grieving’.

Supporters: Friends released this picture of the 'caring father' on Facebook on Wednesday night - but police countered with a statement saying it was not a case of 'simple negligence'

Cause of death: Police announced on Wednesday that Cooper's cause of death was hyperthermia and the result of homicide

Harris’ father Kermit Harris also refused to comment, only saying: ‘We’re all supporting him.’

The news comes as more disturbing details have emerged about the death after police said that there was much more to the case than simple negligence.

Cobb County Medical Examiner's office announced on Wednesday night that little Cooper Harris' cause of death was hyperthermia - or intense heat exhaustion - and confirmed the manner of his death was a homicide.

It has also been alleged Harris had used his office computer to search how long it would take for an animal to die trapped in the back of a hot car.

A law enforcement source in the Georgia county reportedly told Fox 5 News that investigators seized Justin Ross Harris' work computer at Home Depot after his arrest last week and that an internet search suggested the child's death was premeditated.

A police warrant revealed Wednesday that Harris took his son for breakfast at the Vinings Chick-fil-A before driving to work.

He then returned to the car at lunch time to place an object in the car before leaving the child again.

Earlier this week the MailOnline revealed the father was 'acting oddly' and told bystanders who tried to save the child that he had been 'choking' minutes earlier.

Suspicion: Police have alleged that Harris checked on the car which Cooper was in at lunchtime. Witnesses allege he pretended Cooper was choking when he stopped the car after leaving work in a parking lot that is a ten minute drive away. Lastly, cops believe he searched the internet for information on how long an animal can survive in a hot car in the days before Cooper's death

Harris was supposed to drop Cooper to daycare around 9 a.m. last Wednesday but instead went straight to work, allegedly forgetting the boy was strapped in his car seat in the back of the vehicle for seven hours.

But instead of confessing to the tragic blunder – and admitting his baby had been dead for hours – it has been claimed Harris tried to cover his tracks by driving to a nearby shopping center with the dead child and telling onlookers the child had just been choking.

The Cobb County Police Department called for the public's patience in the case in a statement released Wednesday.

They said that during their initial probe, detectives began to obtain physical evidence and testimonial evidence that lead them to believe a more serious crime had been committed that first thought.

Chief of police John R. Houser said, 'I 
understand that tragic accidents similar to this one do occur... (but) 
this investigation must be weighed on its own merit and the facts that 
lead our detectives to charge the father must be presented at the 
appropriate time during the judicial process.

Heartbreaking: Leanna Harris is yet to make a public statement about the loss of her son and husband's arrest

'The chain of events that occurred in this case does not point towards simple negligence and evidence will be presented to support this allegation.'

He added finally: 'In fairness to everyone involved in this emotional case, I would ask that you not make conclusions based on rumor or suspicions and let our judicial system work as it is designed.'
