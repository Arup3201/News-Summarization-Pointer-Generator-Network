Days of our Lives star Bryan Dattilo, who plays Lucas Horton, is a dad again!

Dattilo and his wife of three years, Liz Cameron, welcomed their first child together on June 11. Little Delila Cameron Dattilo arrived just before 3 am., with Bryan having to report to work on the set of Days just 4 hours later!

'Luckily my baby daughter was born at a hospital very close to work so all I had to do was show up with a smile on my face, and the make - up people took care of the circles under my eyes,' he tells MailOnline in an exclusive interview.

Oh baby! DOOL star Bryan Dattilo and his wife Liz Cameron are the proud parents of Delila, who weighed in at 6lbs 13oz

Dattilo, 42, says it’s been an adjustment being a dad again 14 years after his son Gabriel was born.

'First I think it’s going to be different parenting a little girl compared to being the father of a boy,' Dattilo tells MailOnline. 'I want Gabe to grow up to be a strong man, so sometimes I think I am a bit hard on him.  But I’m afraid I’m going to be putty in the hands of a little girl.

'When I first looked into Delila’s little face, I saw a lot of myself. She has my mouth and eyes, and there is something very familiar about her.'

Dattilo, whose son from his first marriage lives with him and his wife, says some of the best times he shares with Gabe are watching and participating in sports, and he can’t help but wonder if Delila will chose shopping trips with mom or curling up on the couch with the boys to watch.

'I coach Gabe’s basketball, football and baseball teams,' says Bryan.'And it’s been a great bonding time for us. I’d love to coach Delila too, and am hoping she will be interested in tennis, soccer or softball. But I will be just as happy sitting in the front row watching her first dance recital. Whatever makes her happy will make me happy too!'

Bryan and Liz also chose to bank the baby’s cord blood with a company called Cryo-cell.

'We did a lot of research into banking cord blood,' says Dattilo. 'And one of the prime uses for stem cells is to help treat Lymphoma or Leukemia. And Delila has grandfathers on both sides who have those illnesses.  

'So who knows, maybe someday the blood we banked will benefit one of them.' 

Banking cord blood taken from a newborn’s umbilical cord is becoming very popular practice because the stem cells found in the cord are younger and more flexible than those found in adults. The stem cells also know how to ‘find,’ injured cells and repair them.

Currently the stem cells are being used in transplants and for the treatment of more than 80 diseases including certain cancers, anemia, and Leukemia. The cells are also a perfect match for baby should she need it sometime in the future.

And when it comes to the kids wanting to follow in their famous father’s footsteps Dattilo admits he’s not sure.

'Of course I want both of them to do whatever makes them happy,' he says. 'But I will explain that being an actor isn’t as easy as it looks. There are a nights where I have to memorize 20 pages of dialogue only to turn around and do the same thing the following day.  

'And the audition process, with its high rate of rejection, is really hard on a person. It’s one of the only careers where you can work hard and do your very best and still not book the job.'

Bryan has been starring in DOOL for 20 years.
