Everton quartet Romelu Lukaku, Kevin Mirallas, Bryan Oviedo and Samuel Eto'o looked in high spirits as they made their way to Wales to face Swansea in the Capital One Cup.

The Toffees take on Garry Monk's side at the Liberty Stadium on Tuesday night in hope of progressing to the fourth round of the competition.

Lukaku and Co. will be hoping to bounce back from their surprise 3-2 home defeat against Crystal Palace on Sunday.

Everton boss Roberto Martinez has seen his side claim just five points from their opening five league games so far this season.

The former Swansea boss knows what it takes to win a domestic cup competition - having guided Wigan Athletic to a famous FA Cup win in 2013.

Martinez could welcome back long-term absentees Oviedo and Arouna Kone for his side's cup tie against the South Wales outfit.
