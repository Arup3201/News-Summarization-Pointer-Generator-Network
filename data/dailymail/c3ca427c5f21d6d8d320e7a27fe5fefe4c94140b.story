Dead: Dejuan Gladney, 18, was killed in the shootout on Saturday night at a biker annual dance party in Fresno, California

Authorities Sunday were investigating what touched off a wild ‘running gun battle’ inside and outside a Fresno motorcycle club's annual dance, leaving one man dead and at least a dozen other wounded.

Shots were still being fired at 2 a.m. Saturday when the first of more than 100 law enforcement officers arrived at the Soul Brothers clubhouse near Fresno, the Fresno County Sheriff's Office said.

The Fresno County coroner identified the dead man Sunday as Dejuan Gladney, 18. The coroner didn't list a hometown.

The gunfire erupted during the Soul Brothers' annual dance, which draws bikers and other motorcycle clubs from all over the state.

About 500 people were inside the warehouse-like clubhouse when the shooting started.

The
shooting quickly tuned into ‘a running gun battle’ in the street 
outside the club, and hundreds of partygoers were running for cover when
the first officers arrived, sheriff's spokesman Chris Curtice said.

Annual dance: The incident happened at the Soul Brothers yearly party which is held at their warehouse-style clubhouse outside of Fresno, California. Around 500 people were there when shots rang out

Victim: Teenager, Gladney, was found dead inside the clubhouse by officers

Despite briefly detaining and questioning about 100 people, authorities have yet to make an arrest.

Gladney and several injured people were found in the clubhouse, which is in an unincorporated neighborhood of Fresno County called Calwa. Another victim was on a nearby street.

Curtice said the injuries ranged from minor to ‘extremely serious’. Authorities have not released the names of the people who were wounded.

Large gatherings of bikers descend on Fresno twice a year, once in the spring and then again in fall, the Fresno Bee reported.

The gatherings frequently turn violent, the newspaper said, but police blame gangs for starting some of the violence rather than the bikers themselves.

'Stay positive': One biker from the Eastside Dragons Motorcycle Club, Kim Cloud, says the shooting had nothing to do with them

'Not us': This biker says incidents like Saturday's shooting as sometimes caused by 'people who linger on and mess it up for everybody'

According to one biker from the Eastside Dragons Motorcycle Club, Kim Cloud, being in a biker gang is a ‘family thing’.

He says they do their best to 'stay positive in the community’.

The shootout started inside and continued outside down the street, according to police.

‘Most
likely it’s not biker involvement, it is sometimes people who linger on
and mess it up for everybody,’ said another biker to ABC30, who wasn’t named.

The club's website was inoperable Sunday and no representative could be reached at the clubhouse.

Old newspaper reports say Soul 
Brothers was formed in 1967 in East Palo Alto as a multi-racial club 
before moving to Stockton then Fresno.

The club also has a Las Vegas chapter, whose phone rang unanswered Sunday.

The incident comes just days after a man was viciously beaten by a group of bikers in New York City.

Three men have been arrested and charged in the vicious beating of Alexian Lien, while another is being sought by police.

NYPD is looking for up to six suspects in the beating, including investgating whether off-duty police officers were present at the incident on September 29.
