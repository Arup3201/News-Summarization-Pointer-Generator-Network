Sergio Aguero produced a magnificent performance, scoring four times as Manchester City demolished a 10-man Tottenham 4-1.The 26-year-old could even have scored more, but missed a first-half penalty. 

Here, Sportsmail's Ian Ladyman gives you his verdict on how the players performed in Saturday's early Premier League kick-off at the Etihad.

MANCHESTER CITY 

JOE HART 9

Aguero will get the headlines for his hat-trick but the England goalkeeper was exceptional and made two or three crucial saves.

BACARY SAGNA 6

The former Arsenal full-back didn’t manage to get forward as much as he would like and had his hands full with Christian Eriksen.

VINCENT KOMPANY 7

Not quite at his inspirational best at the moment but City are still a better side when he is in it.

MARTIN DEMICHELIS 6

Much better so far this campaign than in his debut season, but was off the pace at times here. Got himself in a right mix-up to concede a second-half penalty, even if contact was made outside the box.

GAEL CLICHY 6.5

Did better down his side than Sagna did down, linking up well with James Milner to trouble Eric Dier.

JAMES MILNER 7.5

Increasingly one of the stars of City’s season, Milner is worth his place at the moment. Terrific again here. 

Frank lampard began the game brightly, and won his team's first penalty, but soon had to go off injured

FERNANDO 6

Didn’t really control the centre of the pitch as much as Manuel Pellegrini would have liked. Lost the ball clumsily for Tottenham’s goal.

FRANK LAMPARD 8

Only lasted half an hour but was exceptional, playing a part in City’s first two goals.

JESUS NAVAS 6.5

Needs a run of games to really find his best form but was sporadically dangerous on Saturday. His first thought is always a positive one.

DAVID SILVA 7.5

Playing just behind a centre forward suits the Spaniard, allowing him to find pockets of space. Spurs never controlled him.

SERGIO AGUERO 9.5

What more can we say about this guy? Full of confidence and rightly so. Would have been perfect apart from the penalty miss.

SUBS: Fernandinho (Lampard 27) 6, Jovetic (Silva 69) 6, Toure (Fernando 77) 6.

TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR

HUGO LLORIS 8

Not much the Frenchman could do  really. Made a penalty save and several other good stops but still conceded four.

ERIC DIER 6.5

One of Tottenham’s better defenders, still found it hard to cope with the threat of Milner and Clichy.

YOUNES KABOUL 5.5

The team’s captain but he didn’t really play like it. Spent too much of his time diving in early in dangerous situations.

FEDERICO FAZIO 6

Sent off in the second half for a tug on Aguero, he must have been feeling dizzy by then. Never coped with Aguero and City’s runners.

DANNY ROSE 6

Looked uncomfortable whenever Navas stood up to him. A long afternoon for the full-back.

ETIENNE CAPOUE 6

Told to do an enforcing job in the centre. He did to an extent and managed to disrupt some of City’s rhythm. Faded in the second half though.

RYAN MASON 6

Another Spurs player who had a long afternoon. Again was sporadically effective but couldn’t maintain it. 

Within minutes of City's opener Tottenham grabbed an equaliser courtesy of Christian Eriksen

ERIK LAMELA 5

A day to forget for the Spurs midfielder. Lost the ball in the build-up for City’s first goal and things only got worse.

CHRISTIAN ERIKSEN 7.5

Tottenham’s best outfield player, Eriksen troubled City throughout. Needs to make slightly better decisions with his final pass at times.

NACER CHADLI 7

Looks to be a stayer for Tottenham. Neat and tidy and possesses a killer final pass.

ROBERTO SOLDADO 6

Looked low on confidence, as his penalty miss showed. Was unlucky shortly after that when Hart denied him with his legs.  

SUBS: Dembele (Capoue 59) 6, Townsend (Lamela 59) 6,  Vertonghen (Mason 69) 6.
