Taco Bell has announced plans to beef up its menu - literally - with a whole new variety of high-protein items based on the on-trend Paleo diet.

Each of the burritos and bowls on the new Cantina Power Menu will contain more than 20 grams of protein, double the serving of meat and less than 500 calories altogether, appealing to diners who swear by low-carb dieting.

The change, according to Taco Bell president Brian Niccol, is in keeping with current food trends in the U.S. 'People are not looking for diet food,' he said in a statement. 'They want food that gives them energy.'

Packing a punch: Taco Bell has announced plans to launch a new high-protein Cantina Power Menu based on the Paleo diet, with burritos and bowls packing twice the amount of steak and chicken

The new Cantina Power Menu, which will include a $5.19 steak Power Bowl and a $4.99 chicken bowl, will be introduced to Taco Bell restaurants across the country on July 17.

Not only will the menu items contain more protein - with 29 grams in burritos and 28 grams in bowls - but high-calorie toppings like creamy dressing and rice and beans will be replaced with low-fat options, like cheese and sour cream.

The choices will also be loaded with guacamole, Pico de Gallo and lettuce.

And the fast food chain is even getting in on the Greek yogurt trend; with the new menu, customers will be able to order yogurts from boutique supplier Three Happy Cows, for $2.49 each.

'There are 
lots of yogurt parfaits out there, so we asked ourselves what would get 
people excited about yogurt at Taco Bell,' said Mr Niccol. 'And the 
answer is Greek yogurt.'

Judging
 by current eating trends, Taco Bell can expect the new menu to be 
popular; a recent report from the NPD group found that 42per cent of 
millenials say that eating more protein is somewhat or very important.

And 
according to Euromonitor, sales of protein supplements have grown more 
than 40per cent in the past six years, with experts predicting that they
 will grow another 40per cent by 2018.

New meals: High-calorie toppings like creamy dressing and rice and beans will be replaced with low-fat options, like cheese and sour cream. Each item will be under 500 calories (pictured, the Doritos Locos tacos)

The Paleo 
or Paleolithic diet, which has been lauded by celebrities including Uma 
Therman, Jessica Biel and Megan Fox, is focused on only eating foods 
that were available to cavemen 10,000 years ago.

This means cutting out refined foods, trans fat and dairy, with an emphasis on lean fats, fresh vegetables and nuts and seeds.

Chicken Power Burrito: 29g protein, 460 calories ($3.79)

Steak Power Burrito: 29g protein, 470 calories ($3.99)

Chicken Power Bowl: 28g protein, 490 calories ($4.99)

Steak Power Bowl: 28g protein, 500 calories ($5.19)

Power Greek Yogurt: 17g protein, 240 calories ($2.49)

Recent research has indicated that people who follow a low-carb diet burn 300 calories more per day than those on low-fat plans.

And a high-protein diet also been 
found to have other health benefits, too. Last month, Chinese scientists 
determined that eating as little as one chicken breast or salmon fillet every
 day can reduce the risk of stroke by 20per cent.

'An 
estimated 1.4million stroke deaths could be prevented worldwide each 
year by higher protein consumption,' explained lead researcher Dr 
Xinfeng Liu, from Nanjing University School of Medicine.

To appeal to the country's current protein craze, other chains and brands have amended their ingredients - including Panera, Cheerios and Kashi.

But some 
experts have warned that we may have taken it to the extreme; according 
to the Institute of Medicine, women should consume about 46 grams of 
protein a day, and men should consume 56.

But a recent report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture found that men over 20 get an average of 98.9 grams of protein a day, and women eat about 68 grams.
