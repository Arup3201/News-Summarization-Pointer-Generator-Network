A man who was brutally beaten and left for dead after witnessing his mother's murder is still fighting for justice 36 years on - and says he knows who is responsible for her death.

Eric Garrett, from Muncie, Indiana, was just four when a man entered the home he shared with his mother, 22-year-old Paula Garrett, on March 25, 1979 and savagely beat them with a blunt object - killing her and fracturing the little boy's skull.

A few weeks later, when he was finally well enough to speak with police, he named the attacker as Richard Green, his mother's on-off boyfriend and a married father-of-four.

Even though prosecutors concluded Green was not responsible for the attack, Garrett continues to stand by his childhood claim, while neighbors have also recounted the couple's troubled relationship.

Witness: Eric Garrett, pictured left, is calling for a new investigation into the 1979 murder of his mother, 22-year-old Paula Garrett, right. He says he saw her boyfriend in their apartment before the attack

'This case isn't unsolved, it's just unprosecuted,' Garrett, now 40, told NBC News.

Paula Garrett and Green had met at the restaurant where Paula worked as a waitress and the night before her death, he was at her apartment, investigators told NBC's Dan Slepian.

Green told police that he left late that night and then visited her apartment the following afternoon, where he came across her body. He then alerted neighbors.

But family members told NBC's Dan Slepian that Green had been possessive and abusive, and that Paula had been trying to break up with him at the time of her death.

A neighbor, Larry Smith, added to NBC that he often heard the couple fighting and the night she was killed, he heard Green shout: 'You think you're going to get away with this?' 

The following day, Green barged into Smith's apartment and told the neighbor that Paula had killed herself, he said.

When Smith rushed into the apartment with Green, 'I immediately realized this was no suicide', he said. 'Blood was everywhere.'

He also noticed that her son was covered in blood on the ground but was opening his eyes. He picked up the boy's limp body - all while Green did nothing, Smith said.

When Eric was well enough to speak to police, he named the man and picked his photo from a lineup. He told NBC that he had been sleeping when Green walked in and switched on the light, giving him a good view of his mother's killer.

But a defense team today would raise issues with Garrett's claims, considering his age, the passage of time and the injuries he sustained in the attack, experts told NBC.

Questions: No one has ever been charged in the murder of Paula Garrett, left, or the attack on her son Eric, when he was four. Her boyfriend was initially arrested but was freed after passing a lie detector test

Two months after the death, Green was arrested and charged with his girlfriend's murder, although he protested his innocence. His wife and children also stood by him.

During a bond hearing, a neighbor testified that they saw Green rushing away from the home around 3am on the night of the murder. 

He underwent two polygraph tests, both of which he failed. But there were questions over how the tests were carried out so police took him to Chicago for a further test. After taking it, Green went to the restroom and escaped police custody.

The next day, after it emerged he had passed the third test, police spoke to him on the phone and convinced him to turn himself in.

He was taken back to Indiana where prosecutors dropped the charges - to the anger of police, The Star Press reported.

Despite the decision, Eric's father, Robbie Garrett, said that his son maintained Green 'sent my mommy to heaven'.

In 1981, the case was turned over to a countywide homicide investigation team after a grand jury decided the original probe was 'incomplete and one-sided'. The city later withdrew this decision.

Prosecutor Michael Alexander told NBC that there was no specific evidence indicating Green was the killer. He suggested that the killing could have been motivated by a robbery or a sexual assault.

Testimony: Neighbors said they often heard the young single mother, pictured with her son, arguing with her boyfriend, while one testified that he saw the boyfriend, Richard Green, near her apartment that night

'I was pretty well convinced he didn't commit the crime based on evidence at the scene,' he said. 'I didn't like the idea of charging someone on phony evidence.' 

Police officers from the original case and members of Eric's family have since called for officials to reopen the case, and Delaware County Prosecutor Jeff Arnold said that he has met with Eric and has asked police to look for further leads.

But right now there is no new evidence to bring charges, he said.

After the attack, Eric, who was struck as many as 15 times with the blunt object, was left with partial paralysis on his right side and still has nine dimples on his head where his skull was fractured.

He was raised by relatives and graduated high school. He still lives in the area with his dog.

Green refused to speak with NBC and his daughter told reporters to stop contacting them.
