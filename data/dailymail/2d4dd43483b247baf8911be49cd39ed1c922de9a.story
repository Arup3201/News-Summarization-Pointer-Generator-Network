The toyboy lover of a married secretary jailed after conning her bosses out of hundreds of thousands of pounds has told how she showered him with designer clothes and promised him a Lamborghini for his 21st birthday.

Helen Hart, 46, who swindled more than £300,000 from the firm in Cornwall to fund a lavish lifestyle of five star hotels and private jets, 'dazzled' student Adam Cope, then 20, with shopping sprees in Harrods and tickets to international rugby games.

After spotting the sports student in a gym in Truro and contacting him on Facebook, the conwoman told Mr Cope she was the heir to a multi-million pound gangland fortune, and showed up to their first date driving a Porsche.

'I was just dazzled,' he told the Sun.

'It was private planes, posh hotels, mansions and shopping, like the £3,000 she spent on clothes for me in Harrods.

'Who at my age wouldn't hook up with a rich, gorgeous older woman?'

Mr Cope said Hart bought him expensive gifts including a £1,400 Breitling watch, an iPad, an iMac computer and a £700 iguana skin belt, and that the couple spent the night together for the first time at London's opulent Dorchester Hotel.

Hart, who earned a modest £20,000 a year in her role as company secretary at PDP Green Consulting Ltd in Truro, even whisked the student and his friends to see a rugby international in Cardiff on a private jet - all funded by her fraud.

But Mr Cope grew suspicious when some of Hart's promised gifts - including a Lamborghini sports car - failed to materialise.

He had begun to distance himself from his older lover when police arrested him in September 2011, before releasing him when they realised he too had been taken in by Hart's scam.

Mr Cope returned the gifts to police and jetted to Australia to work in a copper mine, and has said he now wants to forget about his 'fantasist' ex.

Guilty: Helen Hart, pictured left, admitted used money from the company owned by Philip Desmonde, pictured right with his wife Susanne, to pay her rent, water and Marks & Spencer shopping bills, as well as £2,000 on a kitchen and £5,000 on 48 bottles of wine

Offices: The money was taken from PDP Green Consulting (pictured), an architecture and civil engineering firm run based in Truro, Cornwall, where Hart worked as company secretary, the court heard

The missing money was first discovered when 
the accounts of Cornish engineering firm PDP Green Consulting were wiped out - leaving 
it facing an unpaid £271,000 tax bill in May 2011.

Hart was accused of stealing more than £380,000 from the firm between October 2005 and May 2011, but she disputed the amount of money stolen - claiming she had merely embezzled £190,000.

But a court heard on Friday that there was a financial loss to the firm of £325,000 through Hart's fraud, deception and theft.

The 46-year-old forged official court documents, solicitors' letters and the signature of the firm's company director Philip Desmonde in an effort to secure finance and back up claims of her wealth.

The secretary ran up astonishing bills 
including £5,990 for a return trip to Paris, £7,816 on a hotel stay in 
Devon, and £4,752 on tickets and hospitality for a Premier League 
football match.

She also spent £31,368 on renovation work at her home.

She was sentenced to four years in prison on Friday after previously admitting 25 separate charges spanning the period between October 2005 and May 2012.

Passing sentence, Judge
John Neligan told Hart: 'These 
frauds - that is what they are - were committed over six and a half 
years, while you were an employee in a senior and trusted position.

'You used the company money to fund a 
lavish lifestyle, you used the company money to fund expensive luxurious
cars, in all about £65,000 one way or another was spent on cars.'

Hart admitted using the company’s
cash to pay her rent and water bills, as well as spending £2,000 on a 
kitchen, £4,985 on 48 bottles of wine and an undisclosed sum on shopping
at Marks and Spencer.

She also confessed to spending the firm’s money on luxury cars including a Porsche Boxster and a Range Rover.  Hart spent another £46,500 on a Mercedes, using money kept in her Coutts bank account.

Luxurious location: Hart spent £7,800 on staying at the posh Bovey Castle hotel in Dartmoor, Devon

PDP Green Consulting Ltd boss Mr Desmonde and his family have claimed Hart spent much of the money trying to look and dress like his wife Susanne 'to push her out of his life'.

Hart is accused of visiting the same hair salon, wearing the same clothes and even hiring the same fitness instructor as Susanne - echoing the plot of the 1992 movie Single White Female.

She told her boss she inherited the fortune from a gangland uncle who was pals with the Kray Twins.

At an earlier hearing Hart, of Illogan, Cornwall, admitted siphoning off cash to pay her £600-a-month rent and bills for four years.

Jailed: Hart, 46, was sentenced to four years in jail for the scam

In March 2007 she ran up a hotel bill of £8,000 at Bovey Castle, a luxury hotel and golf course in Dartmoor National Park where rooms cost up to £689 a night.

Roger Green, managing director of PDP Green, has said the firm was left disappointed by Hart's sentence.

He said at the time: 'We are of course very pleased with the outcome of this case, although we feel the severity of Mrs Hart's crimes warranted a longer sentence.

'She has defrauded the company over a long period of time, abusing the trust placed in her by the directors of the company and her work colleagues and has shown no remorse for her actions.'

Another victim was the charity Ella's Memory - founded by Martyn and Emmillie Selley in honour of their second child, who was stillborn in December 2009.

Married Hart offered the charity £10,000 in November 2010, claiming to have had a child who suffered a cot death, but the cheque bounced.

She also promised to sponsor Truro Rugby Club after meeting one of its players, claiming she was a multi-millionairess with £10 million inheritance to spend.

Detective Constable Nick Stidwill said: 'She drove luxury cars and dressed well giving the appearance of having money, all based on a fantasy that she had inherited enormous wealth. But the reality was PDP Green was funding it.'
