Looking uncannily like a giant eye in the sky, the Helix Nebula has been captured in stunning new detail by a Nasa space telescope.

The breathtaking image shows a dying star is throwing a 'cosmic tantrum'.

It shows the star's dusty outer layers unraveling into space, glowing from 
the intense ultraviolet radiation being pumped out by the hot stellar 
core.

Looking uncannily like a giant eye in the sky, the Helix nebula lies 650 light-years away, in the constellation of Aquarius.

The image shows the death of a star in the Helix nebula 650 light years from earth.

It is made from images from three telescopes.

GALEX has 
picked out the ultraviolet light pouring out of this system, shown 
throughout the nebula in blue, while Spitzer has snagged the detailed 
infrared signature of the dust and gas in yellow.

A portion of the 
extended field beyond the nebula, which was not observed by Spitzer, is 
from NASA's all-sky Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE).

The brighter purple circle in the very center is the combined 
ultraviolet and infrared glow of a dusty disk circling the white dwarf.

The combined image was taken by NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope and the 
Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX), which NASA has lent to the California
 Institute of Technology in Pasadena.

This object, called the Helix nebula, lies 650 light-years away, in the 
constellation of Aquarius.

Also known by the catalog number NGC 7293, it
 is a typical example of a class of objects called planetary nebulae.

Discovered in the 18th century, these cosmic works of art were 
erroneously named for their resemblance to gas-giant planets.

Planetary nebulae are actually the remains of stars that once looked a 
lot like our sun.

These stars spend most of their lives turning hydrogen
 into helium in massive runaway nuclear fusion reactions in their cores.

In fact, this process of fusion provides all the light and heat that we
 get from our sun.

Our sun will blossom into a planetary nebula when it 
dies in about five billion years.

When the hydrogen fuel for the fusion reaction runs out, the star turns 
to helium for a fuel source, burning it into an even heavier mix of 
carbon, nitrogen and oxygen.Â 

Eventually, the helium will also be 
exhausted, and the star dies, puffing off its outer gaseous layers and 
leaving behind the tiny, hot, dense core, called a white dwarf.

The 
white dwarf is about the size of Earth, but has a mass very close to 
that of the original star; in fact, a teaspoon of a white dwarf would 
weigh as much as several elephants.

The glow from planetary nebulae is particularly intriguing as it appears
 surprisingly similar across a broad swath of the spectrum, from 
ultraviolet to infrared.

The Helix remains recognizable at any of these 
wavelengths, but the combination shown here highlights some subtle 
differences.

The image is eerily reminiscent of the Eye of Sauron from the Lord of the Rings films.

The intense ultraviolet radiation from the white dwarf heats up the 
expelled layers of gas, which shine brightly in the infrared.

GALEX has 
picked out the ultraviolet light pouring out of this system, shown 
throughout the nebula in blue, while Spitzer has snagged the detailed 
infrared signature of the dust and gas in yellow.

A portion of the 
extended field beyond the nebula, which was not observed by Spitzer, is 
from NASA's all-sky Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). The 
white dwarf star itself is a tiny white pinprick right at the center of 
the nebula.

The brighter purple circle in the very center is the combined 
ultraviolet and infrared glow of a dusty disk circling the white dwarf 
(the disk itself is too small to be resolved). This dust was most likely
 kicked up by comets that survived the death of their star.

Before the star died, its comets, and possibly planets, would have 
orbited the star in an orderly fashion.

When the star ran out of 
hydrogen to burn, and blew off its outer layers, the icy bodies and 
outer planets would have been tossed about and into each other, kicking 
up an ongoing cosmic dust storm.

Any inner planets in the system would 
have burned up or been swallowed as their dying star expanded.

Infrared data from Spitzer for the central nebula is rendered in green 
(wavelengths of 3.6 to 4.5 microns) and red (8 to 24 microns), with WISE
 data covering the outer areas in green (3.4 to 4.5 microns) and red (12
 to 22 microns).

Ultraviolet data from GALEX appears as blue (0.15 to 
2.3 microns).

Nasa has previously released this image, dubbed the 'eye of sauron' which also appears to be an eye, showing the spiral galaxy NGC 4151,
