LeSean McCoy's acrimony with Chip Kelly continues to rumble on, with the Buffalo Bills running back taking another swipe at the Eagles head coach.

McCoy was shipped to the Bills in exchange for linebacker Kiko Alonso and says Kelly's team has a college feel and that he doesn't like star talent.

'I don’t think he likes or respects the stars. I’m being honest. I think he likes the fact that it’s "Chip Kelly and the Eagles",' he told the Philadephia Enquirer.

McCoy clearly has a chip on his shoulder about the trade, but slated Philadelphia's 'college feel'

'It was "DeSean Jackson – a high-flying, take-off-the-top-of-the-defense receiver". Or "the quick, elusive LeSean McCoy". I don’t think [Kelly] likes that.'

Since arriving at Rex Ryan's Bills last month, McCoy says he's already at ease with his surroundings before launching another swipe at Kelly.

'Here is more of a NFL type of feel,' McCoy told NFL's Total Access.

'Being with Coach [Andy] Reid for so long... you get used to that. A player's coach. An NFL type of atmosphere in the locker room and around the facility. And for two years in Philly it wasn't like that as much. Not in a negative way, but it was different. It was more like a college feel.'

McCoy ran for 1,000 yards in four of six seasons with the Eagles and still spoke of his surprise at the move.

'Now you put my numbers up. You put my [numbers] up and you’ll see it. It tells you it. In any system – Andy [Reid] or Chip. So I’m not going to go there, back and forth with that. I just feel like the only thing I didn’t like was the respect. For so many years I gave you all what you wanted. You know? And then for how it went down, it was like a surprise. I’m thinking, "Does everybody look at it how I look at it?".'

As well as their trip to Wembley this year to face the Jaguars, Buffalo also travel to Philadelphia in what already promises to be something of a grudge match.
