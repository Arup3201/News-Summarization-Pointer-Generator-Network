In far-from-surprising news, a celebrity boxing match announced earlier this week - set to pit George Zimmerman against rapper DMX 'for charity' - has been called off, with the promoter saying he would rather make people happy than make money from the fight.

In a series of Tweets on Saturday, which have now been deleted, Damon Feldman, who has been orchestrating the fight, said the decision to cancel was based on the public backlash he received for working with Zimmerman.

'This was the wrong person to put in the ring and define celebrity boxing thank you," Feldman Tweeted from his handle, @hollywoodbox11.

'I walked away from av [sic] million dollar payday with this fight but to be honest I'd rather be happy and make people happy thank you.'

'I am breaking every rule in boxing': Rapper DMX, 43, has confirmed he will fight George Zimmerman in a 'celebrity boxing match'

George Zimmerman, 30, was found not guilty of all charges levied against him after he fatally shot 17-year-old Trayvon Martin during a fight in February 2012 inside a gated community in Sanford, Florida

DMX - real name Earl Simmons - was arrested on August 20, 2013, in South Carolina for driving under a suspended license and marijuana possession

Feldman told TMZ earlier in the week that DMZ had been selected out of a pool of more than 15,000 willing fighters to get in the ring with the infamous killer of unarmed black teen Trayvon Martin.

In January Zimmerman, 30, said he has been training for months for a boxing match and that it was his idea to organize a fight.

But due to concerns from the public Feldman, apologized Saturday and said he did not wish to go through with it, The NY Daily News reported.

'I wasn't being disrespected [sic] to anyone I had a plan here with this fight I'll let you know soon hope everyone is happy I'm very sorry,' he tweeted.

'I want to thank everyone for the good n [sic] bad comments I've made the choice to cancel the fight w George Zimmermann [sic] more to life then [sic] money.'

He also tweeted he wanted nothing to do with a Zimmerman fight.

DMX, 43, promised to break every rule in boxing 'to make sure I f--k him right up'.

He also threatened to urinate in his opponent’s face if he won.

'I will beat the living f--k out of him,' DMX told TMZ.

Trayvon Martin, 17, was fatally shot by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, in Sanford, Florida, on February 26, 2012. Zimmerman is now taking part in a 'celebrity boxing match'

'It was my idea,' Zimmerman said in an interview with Radar Online about the fight in January.

'Prior to the incident I was actually going to the gym for weight loss and doing boxing-type training for weight loss and a mutual friend put me in contact with Damon and provided me with an opportunity and motivation to get back in shape and continue with my weight loss goals and also be able to help a charity out,' he said.

'Boxing isn’t new to me.

'It’s something I had picked up well before the incident and it’s something that I liked, I enjoyed, and I kept up with it and I was able to lose a tremendous amount of weight and get a healthy lifestyle.'

'So it’s not a new hobby, it’s something I have been doing and wanting to pursue to maintain a healthy lifestyle.'

In a strange coincidence, today would have been Trayvon Martin's 19th birthday.

Zimmerman was found not guilty of all charges levied against him, after he fatally shot the teen during a fight in February 2012 inside a gated community in Sanford, Florida.

The Hispanic man claimed that he had killed Martin with a weapon in an act of self-defence.

George Zimmerman initially set his aim for Kanye West, saying he should take part in a fight because he constantly attacks people

Zimmerman remained without charge for 44 days after the shooting occurred, which led to nationwide protests and sparked furious debate over racial profiling and the right to use weapons in self-defence.

Further demonstrations broke out after Zimmerman was acquitted in 2013.

Federal authorities are currently reviewing the entire case to decide whether Martin’s civil rights were violated.

Rapper The Game, who has a tattoo of Trayvon Martin on his leg, had previously registered his interest to challenge Zimmerman in a fight.

'I would not be boxing for me,' The Game told TMZ. 

'I'd be boxing for the legacy of Trayvon Martin and for his family.

'I would box him to knock him out.

'I would definitely take pleasure in it. 

'It's legal, and I want to show him you can solve your disputes without a weapon.'
