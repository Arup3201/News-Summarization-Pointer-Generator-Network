Dwain Chambers was ‘running for everything’ as he settled into his blocks for the start of the men’s 100 metres at Birmingham’s Alexander Stadium just before 4.20pm on Sunday

He was running for his fifth consecutive British title and the chance to represent his country at August’s European Championships in Zurich but, at 36, he was also running for his career. And, despite the country’s rich seam of young sprinting talent, it was the veteran performer who claimed victory — yet again.

Chambers powered out of his blocks in lane four, surging past new sub-10-seconds man Chijindu Ujah to his right, and held off a late push from Harry Aikines-Aryeetey to become British champion for the eighth time, in 10.12sec.

Experience beats youth: Dwain Chambers won his fifth straight British Championships 100m title

It was a display of pure guts and sheer determination from a sprinter who has long thrived on proving people wrong.

There
 are those — and plenty of them — who still point to Chambers’ chequered
 past and the two-year ban he served for doping but, although you may 
still wish to deride him, you must never discount him.

He
 drew barely a mention in the build-up to Sunday’s final and he used it 
to his advantage, quietly ticking off the rounds with wins in 10.34 and 
10.12, then reproducing a season’s best when it mattered most.

Surely
 now, nearly 11 years after he gave the urine test that has defined his 
career, it is finally time to celebrate an experienced, wily 
championship performer who simply refuses to go away.

Chambers climbed Mont Blanc for charity last year and continues to scale improbable peaks time and again.

His
 victory guarantees him a place at the European Championships, where he 
first won a 100m silver in 1998, and now he wants to bow out with one 
more individual medal after only being selected to represent England in 
the 4 x 100m relay at the Commonwealth Games. It could prove to be quite
 an emotional swansong of a summer.

Training partners: Chambers and Ujah know each other well but as Ujah said, 'experience won'

Chambers
 said: ‘It did cross my mind (that this could be it). You could say I 
was running for my career. I was running for everything. Doubts do cross
 your mind but you have to learn to just remove them. When that gun went
 “bang” everything disappeared.

‘I
 thought: “Just get out of the blocks. If I get out, the pressure is on 
them, then all I’ve got to do is run in a straight line”. That’s what I 
did. I ran as fast and as hard as I could.

‘I’ve
 climbed many mountains, haven’t I? And fallen down a few. But I still 
keep standing. I’m the Benjamin Button of track and field.’

Chambers
 has been training with Ujah, already the third quickest Briton in 
history at 20 years old, but the veteran’s victory leaves the 
youngster’s participation in the European Championships up in the air.

Chambers’
 and Aikines-Aryeetey’s places are assured after they finished first  
and second on Sunday and ran inside the qualifying time of 10.20, but 
Ujah must trust the selectors’ discretion when they meet on July 14.

Over the top: Chambers kept his composure to clock 10.12 seconds as favourite Ujah finished third

The
 9.96 man has already missed out on a place at the Commonwealths and 
must hope James Dasaolu cannot repeat his 9.91 form of last year in a 
‘B’ race in Lausanne on Thursday, then at the Diamond League meeting in 
Glasgow on July 11.

Dasaolu suffered a hamstring injury in February and is yet to open his outdoor season.

Ujah
 said: ‘I would have loved to win it but experience came through in the 
end. I adapted to someone else’s rhythm. I didn’t feel the pressure at 
all, but I got a bit of cramp in my hip flexor and I was kind of 
panicking a bit. It happens. The Europeans are out of my hands now, so I
 will just have to wait and see. I would love to be selected.’

Earlier
 at the Sainsbury’s British Championships on Sunday, Asha Philip, 23, 
ran 11.11 to win the women’s 100m, with Ashleigh Nelson and 200m 
champion Jodie Williams recording the same time — 11.15 — in second and 
third respectively.

The 3.6 
metres per second illegal wind, however, meant their personal best times
 will not count, but Philip and Nelson are guaranteed their places in 
Zurich, with Williams assured of at least a 200m berth.

Representing: Chambers now qualifies for the European Championships in Zurich in August

Katarina
 Johnson-Thompson, 21, also has the option to contest the long jump, 
high jump or both at the European Championships — which take place less 
than two weeks after she goes for heptathlon gold at the Commonwealth 
Games.

Johnson-Thompson 
finished second in the high jump on Saturday and then won the long jump 
on Sunday, leaping an outdoor personal best of 6.81 metres to add the 
British outdoor title to the European indoor silver she won in March.

A
 huge leap — potentially breaking Shara Proctor’s British record of 
6.95m — remains a distinct possibility this season if the  Liverpool 
athlete can bring her right leg in line with her left after take-off.

‘It’s trailing a lot,’ she said. ‘It’s about 20cm, which I was trying to work on throughout.

‘I’m happy with the distance but there’s definitely more to come. I’ll make a  decision on the Europeans after Glasgow, I think.

‘I
 am fortunate enough to be in the good position that I can pick and 
choose what event to do, but I am leaning towards the long jump because I
 feel a lot more confident in that.’

Versatile: Katarina Johnson-Thompson set an outdoor PB on her way to winning the British long jump title

Setting the bar: The heptathlete can now choose between long jump, high jump and the multi-event for the European Championships
