What next for Javier Hernandez?

Unwanted by Manchester United last summer, Real Madrid softened the blow by bringing the Mexican to the Bernabeu in an unlikely move that raised eyebrows across the football world.

Could the Spanish giants see something that David Moyes, who had no appetite for Little Pea, could not? Apparently not.

Javier Hernandez hasn't been able to make the most of his loan spell at Real Madrid

Hernandez has scored three times in 13 league appearances, coming off the bench on 12 occasions

The 26-year-old was back in the goals for Mexico during their 1-0 victory against Ecuador on Saturday 

Hernandez has started just one league match for Carlo Ancelotti's side this season and on Monday night told Fox Sports that he, like fellow Old Trafford outcast Radamel Falcao, had cried at his situation.

Still only 26, Hernandez is set to return to Manchester following the expiration of his year-long loan where he will face an uncertain future.

The striker's contract with United expires in 2016 and the club will no doubt be looking to cash in.

Hernandez made the revelation while on international duty.

'I've cried,' he said.

'I've been through everything. The feeling I have most of all over the last couple of years is one of frustration.'

He added: 'You feel frustrated when you're part of a team, you do everything you can in training, collaborating and helping, then at the weekend the opportunities to play are minimal.

'I'm in a team but left out of what is important, which are the games.'

Hernandez joined United from Guadalajara in 2010.

He made 154 appearances in four years at the club, scoring 59 goals and rapidly became a cult hero among fans. But after falling out of favour under Moyes, he moved on when Louis van Gaal arrived.

Things have not gone any better in Spain, where Hernandez has scored three times in 13 league appearances, coming off the bench on 12 occasions.

While suffering under Moyes the player's agent, Eduardo Hernandez, claimed that six clubs were interested in securing his services, including one global superpower.

That was borne out when Madrid swooped - although his stock will have fallen in a miserable 12 months.

Will he get another chance at Old Trafford? That is unclear. While Hernandez's cause will no doubt have been helped by a poor season from Falcao, Van Gaal is understood to have lined up replacements and is set for another big-spending summer.

Eduardo, if he has not already, might want to start ringing around those other six clubs.
