From the terrors of the Tower to witch hunts, Jack the Ripper and endless reports of hauntings, the macabre has long had a hold on the popular imagination.

Now ghouls, ghosts, vampires - and a group of Whitby Goths - are the subject of a new exhibition at the British Library.

Called Terror and Wonder: The Gothic Imagination, it charts the evolution of Gothic literature, as well as delving into its real life inspiration.

Original manuscripts by Mary Shelley and Bram Stoker are among the highlights, as is an antique vampire slaying kit from the Royal Armoury and a selection of glamorously Gothic Alexander McQueen frocks.

But fascinating though they are, the real stars of the show are a series of photographs taken by award-winning photographer Martin Parr of the biannual Whitby Goth Weekend.

The event, which has been taking place twice a year since 1997, is one of the most unusual on the national calendar and sees hordes of Goths descend on the sleepy Yorkshire fishing village to enjoy club nights, a market and, of course, group readings of Dracula.

Indeed, the Romanian count, who in the book came ashore in the town, is one of the main reasons behind the choice of location, although Whitby's dramatic ruined abbey also plays a part.

The town was also once one of the main sources of jet, a polished black stone that became an enormously popular part of mourning dress during the Victorian period, thanks, in no small part, to Queen Victoria herself.

Modern Goths, however, are just a part of a story that began in pre-history, when people attributed unusual events to the machinations of ghosts, witches and even angry ancestors.

By the end of the Dark Ages, the British belief in the paranormal was well-established, with those who wanted to avoid a haunting calling on the church to help.

Many did so by purchasing reliquaries such as the elaborate gold and turquoise example from the 12th century that appears in the exhibition.

More still took action using more formidable tools, with vampire hunting kits - complete with mini stakes and holy water - becoming popular in the 15th century.

Not even the royal family were immune from fears about vampires, with one antique example in the exhibition taken from the Royal Armouries.

Despite their fears, however, vampires, ghosts and witches also became popular as literary and theatrical characters, most famously in Shakespeare's Macbeth.

The Victorian period, with its love of all things macabre and elaborate mourning rituals, proved a fertile time for writers with a Gothic bent, with the era producing, among others, Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, Frankenstein and Dorian Grey.

So passionate were the Victorians about Gothic literature, the craze even sparked style and decorating trends, with skeleton-adorned clocks and sombre jet jewellery becoming the height of fashion.

And the penchant for macabre reading material didn't stop with the Victorians, with the success of Bram Stoker's Dracula triggering the Edwardian fascination with vampires, as well as a boost to Whitby's fledgling tourism industry.

Indeed, so successful did Dracula prove, the fanged count still exerts a dark hold on the popular imagination today, with True Blood and Dracula Untold the latest manifestations of the fatal allure of the vampire.

More modern ghost stories include Kate Mosse's The Mistletoe Bride, while others, such as Susan Hill's 1983 novel, The Woman In Black, have been reworked into films for a modern audience.

Older, more occult strands of the Gothic imagination also feature, not least in the 1973 British film, The Wicker Man, which plays on the fear of the occult and the far-older Roman horror of the Druids, whom they accused of using dark magic. 

Musicians too are far from immune to the lure of the supernatural, as a BBC Four spin-off from the exhibition makes plain.

Siouxie and the Banshies and The Cure are just two of the bands to take their inspiration from the macabre, aided and abetted by the world of fashion for whom glamorous Goths remain a perennial source of ideas.

'The exhibition features an amazingly wide range of material, from stunningly beautiful medieval artifacts to vinyl records from the early Goth music scene,' explains curator Tim Pye. 'There is truly something for everyone.'
