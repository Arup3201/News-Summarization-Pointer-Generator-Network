Nigel Clough has promised his Sheffield United side will be every bit as committed to the FA Cup as they were against Premier League Tottenham in midweek. 

Clough heads to face fellow League One side Preston at Deepdale determined to make sure his players don’t drop the standards they produced in the Capital One Cup semi-final first leg. 

He said: ‘It might seem a little subdued after playing in front of 35,000 at White Hart Lane, but it will be business as usual for us. 

Nigel Clough has warned his players they must not drop their standards against Preston

Sheffield United were narrowly beaten in midweek thanks to a penalty by Andros Townsend 

‘We are still very much in the tie against Tottenham and we hope to continue to fight on in all three competitions. 

‘It will be a balancing act in terms of what team I pick — do I name a tired team from Wednesday or introduce some of the lads who didn’t start with fresher legs. 

‘But we will weigh that up and make sure whatever side we start with can produce the performance that a fourth round tie deserves.’ 

Clough signed two of his former Derby players  Paul Coutts and  Kieron Freeman on Friday, but both deals were completed too late for them to play at Preston.
