One of Britain's top generals was the subject of a misconduct inquiry just months before he retired, The Mail on Sunday can reveal.

Lieutenant General Jonathan 'Jacko' Page, 56, a former chief of Special Forces, was accused of inappropriate behaviour by a member of staff.

Last night the Army was accused of a cover-up after refusing to disclose details of the complaint, such as whether it was upheld or if it was made by a female – as military sources have indicated to this newspaper.

Complaint: Lieutenant General Jonathan 'Jacko' Page (pictured), 56, a former chief of Special Forces, was accused of inappropriate behaviour by a member of staff

In February 2012, Lieut Gen Page was made Commander of Force Development and Training (CFDT) – a two-year desk job based at Army headquarters in Andover, Hampshire.

In May the following year he was notified in writing by the Ministry of Defence that he would not receive another job offer once his term as Commander came to an end in February 2014, a decision that effectively terminated his military career.

At some point between Lieut Gen Page receiving the MoD letter and his appointment coming to an end, a formal complaint against him was submitted to Army bosses.

But the MoD insisted last night it could not provide further information about the case, a stance that has infuriated the Shadow Minister for the Armed Forces, Kevan Jones.

He said: 'This case highlights the Army's determination to keep delicate matters in house. There should be greater clarity and the Lieutenant General should be as responsible for his actions as the most junior private soldier, even if at the time the complaint was made he was about to retire.

'At times like these the wagons tend to circle around senior officers, while the Army as an institution has been reluctant for years to have any independent scrutiny, the like of which is standard for any modern organisation or public body.'

When Lieut Gen Page was approached at his home, in Norfolk, he refused to answer any questions.

He said: 'I finished my time. I was appointed for two years [to the CFDT role].

'I was told when I was appointed that I would do two years.' Asked whether the misconduct allegation was made by a female colleague, he replied: 'I have nothing to say, thank you.'

Lieut Gen Page served with the Parachute Regiment during the Falklands War. He later commanded the SAS before leading the Joint Force Headquarters.
