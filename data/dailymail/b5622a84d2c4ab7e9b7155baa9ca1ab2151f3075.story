Do any of these sentences sound remotely like anything related to the Nani who left Manchester United on loan in August?

'Nani has had a very good attitude to his training,' his manager at Sporting Lisbon Marco Silva is quoted as saying in Portuguese newspaper Record.

In a poll run by the popular publication last month, 71 per cent voted the winger as the best player in Portugal's top-flight so far this season.

'I hope to continue giving joy to my colleagues,' Nani, 28, said after starring in their 4-2 Champions League win against Schalke.

Is this the same man who left Old Trafford in the summer? Who made just 22 Premier League appearances and struggled with injury in the last two seasons? Have United actually sent some eager, motivated, determined teenage hopeful over in a Nani body suit instead?

United are still paying his £120,000 per week wages in full and received no loan fee, although it is understood the move was integral to the signing of Marcos Rojo.

Cristiano Ronaldo versus Lionel Messi will be the main event when Portugal face Argentina at Old Trafford on Tuesday night, but Nani's appearance on the undercard will be equally as interesting for United fans.

Even if he impresses yet again, they will have to wait until the end of the season to see him back there permanently. According to another Portuguese paper O Jogo, Nani has rejected the chance to return to Manchester in January and wants to continue the rebuilding job on his reputation in Portugal. He has already scored five goals in 13 matches.

They haven't just been any old goals, either. Against Gil Vicente, he flicked the ball over his head, nodded it to an opponent then hit the return pass first-time into the bottom left corner from 25 yards.

Nani has been gearing up for Portugal's upcoming friendly match against Argentina at Old Trafford 

Cristiano Ronaldo will also return to his former stomping ground for his side's friendly against Argentina 

Versus Penafiel he passed out wide, continued his run into the box then flicked the ball first-time over the opponents' goalkeeper from a tight angle. His first for the club, against Maribor, was a wonderful left-footed effort which curled powerfully into the bottom left corner from the edge of the box.

The 28-year-old is becoming a match-winner for them, scoring and starring in their 4-2 Champions League victory against Schalke. He scored the third goal to swing the tie in their favour, also got an assist and won the free-kick for another with a cheeky step-over. Confidence was spilling out of his boots as he juggled the ball shortly before being substituted at the end to a standing ovation.

This isn't necessarily the Nani of old. In England he has never performed like this. It's more the Nani that Nani has been telling everyone about since Nani moved over in 2007.

It is the Nani that Sir Alex Ferguson envisaged when he signed him for £25.5million from Sporting Lisbon seven years ago.

'With Nani we were buying pure raw material,' Ferguson wrote in his latest autobiography. 'He was immature, inconsistent, but with a wonderful instinct for football.

'When you buy a player with all those talents, the trick is to put them in order. He was a bit disorganised and needed to be more consistent.

'What attracted me to Nani was his pace, strength and aerial ability. He had two fine feet. Gymnastic, too. His athletic read-outs were always first-class. So the foundations were there.'

Silva is confident he will be able to carry this current form into any club, even one as big as Manchester United. 'Good players always have a big influence,' he added. 'Nani, big player that he is, has a major influence, as he would in any team. At the level he is now, he has a huge influence.'

This could just be a case of a big fish in a small pond, but Nani only signed a new five-year deal last year so he is contracted to United until 2018 and has plenty of time to become a Premier League shark.
