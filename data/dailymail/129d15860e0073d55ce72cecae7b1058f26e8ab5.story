Slain: Charles G. Gholdoian was murdered Tuesday when a suicidal gunman police now say was on a mission of violence entered the Reno hospital where he worked and opened fire

Police think a suicidal gunman was also on a mission of violence when he calmly entered a third-floor urology office and opened fire with a 12-gauge shotgun, killing one doctor, critically wounding another and shooting a third victim after warning patients and their children in a waiting area to ‘get out.’

Charles G. Gholdoian, 46, was shot and killed at the scene. His colleague Dr. Christine Lajeunesse and a visitor to the hospital, Shawntae Spears, 20, were each shot once, but survived.

As Spears and Lajeunesse try to recover in the very hospital where they were shot, police have undertaken an investigation of the unnamed gunman, who motive eludes them thus far.

‘But the fact the shooter went through
 the first and second floor, made his way to the third floor of the 
building, would indicate to me it is not a random event,’ said Reno 
Deputy Police Chief Mac Venzo.

A
 witness who was among those the shooter passed in the waiting room said
 Wednesday that the Northern California man could have killed many more 
people at the Reno medical complex if that was his intent.

Holding on: Dr. Christine Lajeunesse, left, was a colleague of the slain Dr. Gholdoian's and was critical condition but conscious on Wednesday. Shawntae Spears, 20, (right) was shot by the 12-guage shotgun as well. Her condition was upgraded from critical to serious on Wednesday

Detectives
 have not been able to establish any relationship the man may have had 
with the two doctors and the relative of a patient who were shot Tuesday
 before the gunman killed himself.

‘While
 we piece this thing together, we are trying to figure out what that 
relationship is, if there is a relationship at all,’ said Chief Mac 
Venzo.

Innocent victim? Lajeunesse is a urologist at Urology Nevada and remained listed in critical condition on Wednesday as police struggled to determine why a still unnamed Northern California man burst into her department and shot up the place before killing himself

Gholdoian, a 
urologist at Urology Nevada within the Center for Advanced Medicine on 
the campus of the Renown Regional Medical Center was killed at the 
scene.

‘Urology Nevada 
is shocked and saddened by the events that occurred,’ the medical center
 said in a statement. ‘At this time we have no information as to why 
these terrible events occurred, and we are cooperating with the 
authorities in every way possible to learn more.’

Dr.
 Michael Morkin, an emergency room surgeon and the incoming chief of 
staff at Renown, where the victims were taken, said both doctors were 
his friends. He described them as ‘exceptional physicians.’

‘It is a very difficult time for the medical community,’ he told reporters.

Spears' condition improved Wednesday from critical to serious, the hospital said.

Friends told Reno Gazette Journal the mother of two was in good spirits Wednesday and wrote on Facebook, ‘I am OK. Message me if you want to visit.’

‘She has two little boys and she so enjoys being a mom,’ said Spears' friend Denna Tinnin Klink.

Lajeunesse was conscious Wednesday but remained in critical condition at Renown, hospital officials said.

Police were withholding the name of the killer because they said they still have not been able to reach his next of kin.

'I am OK': Spears has two sons and friends say she is a deeply devoted mother. Thankfully, it appears she'll be reunited with her boys very soon

No connection? Police had yet to find a connection between the victims including Spears (left) and the unnamed shooter, who was a resident of the Northern California town of Lake Almanor

But
 Plumas County Sheriff Greg Hagwood confirmed in neighboring Northern 
California on Wednesday that Reno police searched the gunman's home 
Tuesday night in Lake Almanor, a small community about 130 miles north 
of Reno. The search was first reported by the Reno Gazette-Journal.

Hagwood said the man was a long-time resident of the community and lived alone.

‘Part
 of the investigation and service of the search warrant was to help 
identify next of kin,’ Hagwood told AP, adding that authorities have 
established he has California relatives outside of Plumas County. He 
said investigators were ‘taking every measure possible to make 
notification of family as quickly as they can so they're not watching 
the news and having the unsettling experience of finding out that way.’

City of Reno spokeswoman Sharon Spangler said her office could not confirm or comment on the developments.

She said Wednesday night she did not anticipate any additional information would be released before Thursday.

Crime scene: The shooting happened inside Centers for Advanced Medicine B on East 2nd Street, but the shooter confusingly lived 120 miles from Reno, in Lake Almanor

Police said there were about 100 people in the office building when authorities were alerted at 2:05 p.m. Tuesday about an ‘active shooter.’

Venzo said investigators have talked to 29 witnesses so far, with more interviews pending.

Vitalis Ozoude, a state auditor, was in the reception area of Urology Nevada with his wife and 3-year-old son waiting for his child's appointment when the gunman walked in and eventually told them and others to leave.

‘I don't think he meant to kill everybody because if he did he had ample opportunity to do that,’ Ozoude told AP. He said the dozen or so people in the waiting room didn't immediately react to the sight of a man carrying the gun because he seemed calm.

‘He looked like he belonged. I thought he worked there, and he was just getting a gun from his car or taking it to his office,’ he said.

Lockdown: Police swarmed the hospital following the deadly incident

Vicki Green, another patient who said she was standing within an arm's length of the shooter at one time, said he ‘seemed calm, yet agitated at the same time.’

‘He started swinging the gun and telling everybody in the waiting room, `You need to get out, you better get out, you should get out,'‘ Green told KRNV-TV. ‘People started picking up their stuff and their kids and running.’

Venzo said the gunman went past the front desk at the urologist's office and entered the patient examination rooms.

Moving through the exam area, he fired at least four rounds from the shotgun, striking the three victims, before making his way back to the office's waiting area and turning the gun on himself, police said.

The shooting comes nearly two months after a 12-year-old boy opened fire at an area middle school, killing a math teacher before killing himself. Two victims from that attack were treated at Renown Regional.

The medical center also has treated 
victims of other recent tragedies, including a crash at a Reno air race 
in 2011 that killed 11 people and a shooting rampage at a Carson City 
restaurant the same year that killed three uniformed Nevada National 
Guard members.
