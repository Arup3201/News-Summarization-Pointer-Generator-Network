A group of nuns from an enclosed community in Ireland have gained worldwide fame after producing a hilarious ice bucket challenge video.

Members of the Redemptoristine Order, based in Dublin, usually spend their days in prayer, meditation and studying the Bible.

But after hearing of the ice bucket challenge craze that is sweeping the globe, the sisters couldn't help but get involved.

Members of the Redemptoristine Order, based in Dublin,  filmed themselves doing the ice bucket challenge

The video of the sisters taking part in the craze has received a warm response, with 3,000 likes on Facebook

A video posted on Facebook shows three of the nuns, dressed in their traditional red robes and black and white habits, lining up to be soaked with ice-cold water.

Another trio, one walking with a Zimmer frame, then take turns at dousing them with water from a huge container.

Giggling like school girls, the nuns assure viewers that 'our nominations will come soon', before they are covered in freezing water.

One of the three screams 'oh Lord' as water pours down on her, while others run out of camera shot in their wet robes.

The film has already been liked by more than 3,000 of the website's users and more than 6,000 people have shared it with their friends.

Among the hundreds of comments left below the video, one viewer wrote: 'Well done sisters.. best video I've seen on Facebook and all for a great cause.'

As well as using small buckets and bowls, the sisters use a huge blue water butt to pour water on one nun

The video ends with the sisters waving goodbye and promising to nominate others to undertake the challenge

Another fan wrote: 'My favourite ice bucket challenge so far. Well done Sisters. Good sports and all for a great cause'

The Redemptoristine Order, which dates back to the 17th century, describe themselves as 'an enclosed contemplative community of religious women'.

The group's website states that they rise at 6.30am for meditation and morning prayer, eat in silence and only watch the news 'a couple of evenings a week'.

They have declined to comment on the success of the video, but say in the film that they will contact those they choose to nominate personally.

The ice bucket challenge has spread across the globe this summer as a way of raising awareness of and money for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis charity, the ALS Association.

The association said on its website this week that it has received more than £80million in donations from the challenge.
