Police in Queensland are being given three years to get their fitness up to scratch plus free doctors trips in a bid to combat the rise of overweight officers.

Queensland Police Commissioner Ian Stewart has promised to help his staff get into shape so that they can pass the new Fit For Duty tests every two years from 2017.

In a bid to battle the bulge amongst the ranks, any officer that is found to be unfit after the fitness test will be sent to see dieticians, sport psychologists and health counsellors – for free.

Fit for duty: Every Queensland police officer will have to undergo a new fitness test, seen here, from 2017

'By paying for them to go to the doctor, it perhaps helps identify issues that they need to take responsibility about themselves,' Commissioner Stewart told the Courier Mail.

But the Queensland Police Union says free doctors' trips are not enough – they also want tax deductions on gym memberships and rostered exercise time for their staff.

Previously, Queensland officers have only had to pass a fitness test while training at police academy.

However, in three-years' time 'everyone from the most junior constable to the Commissioner of Police’, will have to prove their health, Commissioner Stewart said.

Fighting the flab: Queensland Police Commissioner Ian Stewart has promised to improve the fitness in his force

Under control: The Control the Problem station simulates a physical take down and subsequent cuffing procedure

The tests will involve all the normal things you would imagine police should already be able to do, including tasks such as climbing over and crawling under fences.

Plus, a 200m foot chase and cuffing a 'violent offender'.

The Queensland Police Union has raised concerns about 'what processes will be put in place to assist police to get to and maintain the required fitness level'.

They want to know whether police will be given rostered time to achieve the fitness goals and if there will be any 'financial incentives for members to pass the test'.

In an article in the June Police Journal they explained that they want to know 'what officers may be able to claim as a tax deduction (such as gym membership and sporting equipment), and the specifics of the exemption policy and how it will be handled'.

On top of it: Participants bring the takedown dummy to the ground twice on each side of the body, then safely cuff the Cuffman ensuring the handcuffs are double locked. Timing stops once the Cuffman is rolled into the recovery position

Get to the problem: This test station simulates a 200m foot chase. It includes changing direction, jumping a 1.5 metre ditch, negotiating a doorway, climbing and descending stairs, negotiating knee high (50 centimetre) hurdles, clearing a fence, and crawling through a narrow space. Participants complete four laps of the course in a 'figure 8' pattern. On the first two laps, participants climb over a 1.5 metre fence, and on laps three and four crawl through a crawl space

They said these issues have not been addressed yet so no policy has been implemented.

The article goes on to explain how Victoria was the first state to bring in a fitness test.

'Their test includes a beep test, push ups, a swim, and a speed and agility test... and a lot of people were failing it,' they wrote.

Queensland Police will introduce a test that is specific to their duties.

'We obviously don’t expect our police to chase people for kilometre after kilometre; I suppose having that level of endurance and fitness is just not reflective of the genuine occupational requirements of the job,' the journal said.

The challenge: Any officer that is found to be unfit after the fitness test will be sent to see dieticians, sport psychologists and health counsellors - for free

But they highlighted the need for upper body strength and being nimble enough to crawl and climb.

The first fitness tests will begin from 31 December 2017.

Commissioner Stewart was unavailable for comment when contacted by MailOnline on Monday.

The proposed 'deployment readiness test' is completed in three distinct stations:

Anyone with police powers will have to pass the test.
