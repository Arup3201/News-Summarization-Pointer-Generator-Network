An independent report released Friday says the University of Missouri failed to follow parts of the federal law that governs sexual harassment on campus when handling the case of a former swimmer's suicide.

The report concludes administrators on the Columbia campus should have investigated 20-year-old Sasha Menu Courey's 2011 death after her parents raised questions about the events leading to her suicide. Menu Courey alleged she was sexually assaulted during her freshman year by as many as three football players, 16 months before she died.

The school previously said it didn't act sooner under the 40-year-old Title IX law or more recent U.S. Department of Education instructions because neither Menu Courey nor her parents sought a police investigation and didn't respond to a later request for information.

The case was referred to Columbia police in late January after ESPN's 'Outside the Lines' raised numerous questions about the university's response.

The
 report makes no specific recommendations for possible changes but 
instead provides a detailed accounting of the university's response. 
Among its primary findings: The university lacked a policy advising 
employees of their obligations to report suspected sexual assault and 
harassment, which federal law suggested.

University
 President Tim Wolfe took action on that very issue Tuesday with an 
executive order that requires all university employees other than those 
legally bound by confidentiality to report such claims to the 
university's Title IX coordinator.

'It became clear to us that we needed a stronger, more transparent policy,' he said at a news conference Friday.

The
 Title IX coordinator and local police should have been alerted to Menu 
Courey's claims in November 2012 after a public records request by her 
parents produced documents alluding to a possible attack, the report 
determined. The Title IX coordinator also should have been told about 
the possible assault nine months earlier when athletics department 
employees learned about it in a local news story, the law firm 
concluded.

University 
curators received the report, by the Dowd Bennett law firm of suburban 
St. Louis, during a closed-door session in Rolla on Friday. After the 
meeting, Wolfe apologized to Menu Courey's 'family, friends and 
teammates.'

'We're 
truly sorry for this heartbreaking tragedy and apologize for whatever 
shortcomings may have occurred on our part, and our treatment of her 
while she was one of our students,' he said. 'You remain in our thoughts
 and prayers as a university community.'

Wolfe
 also said the report shows that 'our university employees acted in good
 faith with the best interests of Sasha Menu Courey and her family in 
this matter. There was no attempt to cover anything up.'

Other
 sexual assault cases have been linked to Missouri's athletic 
department, including former running back Derrick Washington's 2010 
conviction for sexually assaulting a tutor in her sleep. Basketball 
player Michael Dixon transferred in 2012 after two sex assault claims 
against him went public, though he was never charged.

The
 report's release also follows a turbulent week for Missouri athletics, 
in which transfer Zach Price was kicked off the men's basketball team 
Thursday after two arrests and star receiver Dorial Green Beckham was 
dismissed from the football team moments after the curators' meeting 
Friday following an investigation into a suspected burglary. No charges 
were filed against either man.

Menu
 Courey, who grew up outside Toronto, killed herself at a Boston 
psychiatric hospital after withdrawing from classes midsemester and 
being diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, a disease her 
family said she struggled with before college but which went 
undiagnosed.

The 
Associated Press normally doesn't name alleged victims of sexual 
assault, but Menu Courey's parents have publicly discussed the case at 
length, as has the university.

In
 a diary entry found by her family after her death, Menu Courey wrote 
she had told an academic counselor in Missouri's athletic department 
about the rape while hospitalized in Boston. The report's five-lawyer 
investigative team interviewed the counselor, who longer works for the 
school, and determined that 'it cannot be definitively concluded that a 
report of sexual assault ... was made to any employee or official of the
 university while Sasha was alive, other than medical personnel.'

The
 ex-counselor told investigators Menu Courey didn't mention a rape, and 
that the counselors spoke to her while in a noisy restaurant.

'It
 is possible that either because of a miscommunication or an inability 
to hear everything, there was an unintentional disconnect' between the two women, the report said.
