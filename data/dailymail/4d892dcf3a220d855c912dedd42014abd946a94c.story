A Texas teenager has been fired from her job at a pizza parlor before she even started after she sent out a tweet complaining about the gig and her new boss saw it. 

In a hilarious Twitter exchange, a twitter user who goes by 'Cella' wrote: 'Ew I start this f*** a** job tomorrow.'

The next morning, Robert Waple - the owner of Jet's Pizza in Mansfield, Texas - tweeted at her: 'And....no you don't start that FA job today! I just fired you! Good luck with your no money, no job life!' 

He was moved to tweet for only the second time since he started the account in 2009.  

Twitter user Cella sent out this tweet on Friday night before she was due to start a new job

Justice: Robert Waple - the owner of Jet's Pizza, who hired Cella - fired back and sacked her after seeing the dismissive, vulgar tweet

The exchange became an instant hit online. Mr Waple's tweet has been retweeted 3,800 times and favorited more than 4,200. 

Mr Waple said that one of Cella's future co-workers told him about the tweet and he had to log on to check it out himself. 

After firing Cella, several former employees chimed in to comfort her to say that working at Jet's Pizza wasn't all that great, anyway. One said it was the worst job he ever had. 

One Twitter user told Mr Waple: 'Just thought you should know I was stoned out of my mind every time I went into work, and your pizza sucks.'

He replied: 'Being high would only partly explain how you could deliver a pizza to the wrong house...multiple times. You have no hockey skills.'

Cella didn't seem too broken up about getting fired - but was relishing her new-found internet fame after the Twitter exchange went worldwide 

Riding off into the sunset: Mr Waple, who hadn't tweeted since setting up his account in 2009, seemed satisfied with his online work

Jet's Pizza in Mansfield, Texas, was where Cella was supposed to start her job on Saturday

Another Twitter user rose to Cella's defense, saying that the firing was unjustified: '@Cellla_ you were exercising your freedom of speech and never mentioned the company name so you got fired for no reason, contact HR asap.' 

Cella, who today tweeted about having to go to a court date, seemed to take it all in stride. 

She tweeted: 'That moment when someone snitched on you trying to get you in trouble but instead accidentally gets you famous.' 

As for Mr Waple - who joined Twitter in 2009 and hadn't tweeted before the Cella incident - he gracefully excited Twitter.

'Made my point today. I'll check in again in 6 years,' he wrote.
