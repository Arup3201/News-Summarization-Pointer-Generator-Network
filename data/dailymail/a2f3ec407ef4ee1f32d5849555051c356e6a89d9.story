A father who saw his son fatally shot by Los Angeles police on live television has filed a $20 million wrongful death lawsuit in federal court against the city.

The suit filed on behalf of parents Billy Beaird and Christal Benjamin on Thursday alleges officers violated the Constitution and state law when they fatally shot Brian Beaird, 51, who was unarmed.

Beaird, an injured veteran, was shot on December 13 after police officers pursued him for nearly an hour for allegedly reckless driving.

The chase ended when his Corvette hit a car in an intersection, seriously injuring the other driver, and then spun onto a downtown sidewalk.

Beaird's father watched live as his son, a disabled veteran, staggered out of the Corvette, briefly raised his hands, was fatally shot multiple times in the front and back, and fell to the ground.

The lawsuit alleges that officers were inadequately trained, used excessive force and committed battery and negligence.

It states that the shooting is the 'fruit of the LAPD's longstanding unconstitutional customs and practices with respect to the use of deadly force' and criticized the department for a rising number of police shootings recently with little consequence for most officers.

'This has contributed to a culture of impunity, subject to which officers believe that they can open fire without consequences,' it states.

Los Angeles police Cmdr. Andrew Smith said the department doesn't comment on pending litigation.

Chief Charlie Beck said in a statement in December that he was 'very concerned' after reading a preliminary report on the shooting.

Beck has placed three officers on leave until the investigation ends, when they may receive discipline or further training.

After the shooting last year, Bill Beaird said that he had turned on the TV after his panicked son called him while on the case. He insisted he had done nothing wrong.

'Pull over,' Bill Beaird told his son, 'he said he was going to do it, but he didn't do it.'

He then watched in horror as the crash and shooting unfolded - initially thinking he son has only been hit by a Taser gun.

'I just canâ€™t seem to get over this,' he said.

He added that his son suffered from severe paranoia after brain tumor surgery that caused him to be discharged from the military - a condition that fueled his impulse to speed away.

Attorney Dale Galipo, who is representing Beaird's parents, said the shooting is indicative of a larger problem nationally that needs to be addressed.

Galipo said there have been more than 10,000 police shootings in Los Angeles County over the last 30 years but 'not one criminal prosecution of a police officer for a shooting. And that is why many members of the public think the system is unfair.'

He added: 'If anyone other than a police officer had done that shooting (of Beaird) that would be first-degree murder. They would be in jail without bail.'
