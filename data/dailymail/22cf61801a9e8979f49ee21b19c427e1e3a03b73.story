Australia have ruled paceman Mitchell Johnson out of their plans for the fourth Test against India.

Johnson is struggling with a hamstring problem and is effectively being rested by Australia, who carry a 2-0 winning lead into the final match of the series.

With one-day matches against England and India to come, followed by the World Cup, Australia are determined to protect the 33-year-old Johnson to ensure he is available for the key matches that lie ahead.

Australia head coach Darren Lehmann said in a statement from Cricket Australia: 'Mitchell is an important part of our plans for the remainder of our summer and we want him 100 per cent right so won't be taking any risks with him. We believe it is best for Mitchell to take this opportunity to freshen up and get his body fully fit ahead of the Tri Series.'

The fourth Test takes place in Sydney from 10.30am on Tuesday .

Australia physiotherapist Alex Kountouris said: 'Mitchell had some right hamstring soreness during the Boxing Day Test and we have been closely monitoring his recovery since that match but feel he has not fully recovered.

'As such, he will not play in the upcoming Sydney Test match.

'We expect him to recover in time to play a part in the upcoming Tri Series against England and India.'

Meanwhile, Australia captain Michael Clarke remains hopeful of playing in next month's World Cup after revealing he is ahead of schedule in his recovery from injury.

A hamstring injury forced Clarke out of the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Test series against India after the opening game in Adelaide in mid-December, allowing Steve Smith to lead the team to a series win with one left to play.

The 33-year-old Clarke had initially revealed fears of never playing again, but is now well into the rehabilitation process following surgery, with Australia set to open their World Cup campaign against England on February 14.

In his column for Australia's Daily Telegraph, Clarke wrote: 'I'm a week ahead of schedule in my rehab from hamstring surgery. I've already completed three running sessions and am back riding the bike.

'I'm still looking at being fit by the early stages of the World Cup but I'll ultimately be guided by our medical team.'

Clarke has also been enjoying the commentary box vantage point for the series, as Australia drew the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne to clinch the series ahead of this week's final game in Sydney.

Arguably the biggest fallout from the third Test was the retirement of Clarke's India counterpart Mahendra Singh Dhoni from the five-day game.

Clarke paid tribute to the Ranchi-born wicketkeeper batsman, saying: 'I can't imagine there would be many jobs in international sport tougher than being the captain of India's cricket team.

'I doubt many have dealt with the expectation, scrutiny, pressure and extreme adoration better than MS Dhoni.

'How Dhoni has managed to hold down the captaincy while playing all three forms of the game and wicketkeeping is beyond me. He's done a wonderful job and I think the hole he has left in the Test team will be hard to fill.'
