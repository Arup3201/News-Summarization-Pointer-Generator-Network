Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan says he is sorry for the conduct of his employees tied up in the embarrassing Colombia prostitution scandal.

At a Senate hearing on the scandal Wednesday, Sullivan apologised 'for the conduct of these employees and the distraction it has caused.'

Sullivan testified before Congress for the first time since the scandal erupted in Cartagena, Colombia, in advance of President Barack Obama's arrival for a South American summit in April.

Sen Joseph Lieberman said there have been 64 instances of allegations or complaints of sexual misconduct made against Secret Service employees in the last five years.

Many of the instances involved employees sending sexually suggestive emails.

Three involved charges of inappropriate relationships with a foreign national and one was a complaint of 'non-consensual intercourse,' Sen Lieberman said during his opening statement at the Senate hearing.

Lieberman said the allegations were troubling and raised questions about the culture of the agency but the reports did not necessarily show a pattern of wrongdoing by employees.

By the end, Sullivan's job appeared secure even as new details emerged that left little doubt, senators said, that a pattern of sexual misbehavior had taken root in the agency.

Sen Susan Collins of Maine, the senior Republican on the Homeland Security panel that heard Sullivan's first public accounting of the episode, said Sullivan 'kept saying over and over again that he basically does think this was an isolated incident and I don't think he has any basis for that conclusion.'

Sen Lieberman added: 'For the good of the Secret Service, he's got to assume that what happened in Cartagena was not an isolated incident or else it will happen again.'

Still, Sullivan insisted repeatedly that in his 29-year Secret Service career he had never heard anyone say that misconduct was condoned, implicitly or otherwise.

'I just do not think that this is something that is systemic within this organization,' Sullivan said.

Investigators have already interviewed the Colombian prostitute at the centre of the affair, Dania Londono Suarez.

She said a dispute over payment at the Hotel Caribe in Cartagena led to the April 12 incident becoming public.

One man, identified as Arthur Huntington, allegedly agreed on a price of $800 to have sex with Miss Suarez, she said in a recent interview.

She explained that during the transaction she gestured the amount with hand signals and using the words 'sex', 'sexo', 'cash' and dinero' to get the point across.

She said the pair had 'normal' sex and then the agent fell asleep, giving her ample opportunity to steal whatever she wanted from his hotel room - which she did not do.

The 24-year-old said the next morning, although the man wanted her to stay, she asked for the money they had agreed upon the previous evening - which was when he became 'very angry'.Â 

The agent then gave her $50 and closed the door on her.

Then police got involved, sparking a Secret Service investigation.

A dozen Secret Service officers and supervisors and 12 other U.S. military personnel have been implicated in the incident, which took place before President Obama's visit to the Summit of the Americas.

Eight people with the Secret Service, including two supervisors, have been axed from their posts as a result of their involvement.

The Secret Service is moving to permanently revoke the security clearance for one other employee, and three others have been cleared of serious wrongdoing.

Prostitution is legal in Colombia.
