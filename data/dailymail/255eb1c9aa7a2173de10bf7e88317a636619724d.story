Twenty-two people were killed after a tugboat on a test voyage overturned in the Yangtze River, Chinese state media have confirmed.

Four Singaporeans, an Indian, an Indonesian, a Japanese and a Malaysian were among the men who died in the accident, while the 14 other victims were Chinese, the state-run Xinhua News Agency said.

Just three people, all Chinese, were pulled alive from the water after the 368-ton ship capsized on Thursday.

Among the rescued was one man, identified as an interpreter, who was freed when rescuers cut through the bottom of the boat's hull early Friday -  a full 14 hours after it went down.

Just three people were rescued, including an interpreter who was cut from the ship's hull 14 hours after the ship sank

Rescue crews were only able to conduct a thorough search of the tug boat on Saturday morning, then it was pulled into shallow waters

Survivor Wang Zhenkai, who spoke to state television from his hospital bed, said: 'Water entered the boat cabin very quickly, in less than 20 seconds it was completely filled with water.'

Wang was accompanying a Japanese technician who was testing the engine of the ship.

He survived by clinging to a hydraulic pump and said he had grabbed the Japanese engineer, but their grasp was broken as the boat began to sink.

Rescuers, who had been hampered by swift currents, finally managed to pull the 98-foot long Wanshenzhou 67 into shallow waters this morning, allowing them to search inside.

The ship had been on a test voyage in the river's Fubei Channel, in Jiangsu province, and it is understood the ship's owner, parts supplier and engineer were among the 25 people aboard when it went under. 

An official at the Jiangsu maritime search and rescue center, who declined to give his name, confirmed that 22 people were dead. 

The ship was built by Anhui Bengbu Shenzhou Machinery Co. Ltd in October.

Distraught relatives gathered at the banks of the river, in Jiangsu province, to wait for news of their missing loved ones

Emergency services took 40 hours to get the ship into shallow water after it overturned in river's Fubei Channel

Survivor Wang Zhenkai revealed it took less than 20 seconds for the water to fill the boat cabin 

 The final body was retrieved on Saturday afternoon, maritime officials said.

A Singapore foreign ministry spokesman said Friday that the vessel was registered in the city-state and four of its nationals were on board.

The accident occurred on a stretch of the river that experiences extremely strong currents, between the cities of Jingjiang and Zhangjiagang, which is close to the Yangtze's mouth near the commercial hub Shanghai.

The provincial government said the boat was undergoing trials without properly completing the required procedures and without first reporting the condition of the ship, as required by regulations.
