No one wants to be alone at Christmas and Debenhams customers are no exception, as the department store's heartwarming new festive ad makes clear.

Filmed in Budapest, the short film shows
 off Debenhams' Christmas offering in a series of festive scenes set in different parts of the Hungarian capital.

The stars of the ad, which premieres on Wednesday, are a young couple kept apart during the festive period who eventually manage to come together for a spectacular finale set in an ice rink.

Festive romance: Debenhams customers won't be lonely this Christmas if the ads are to be believed

Apart: The starring couple are followed through a succession of festive scenarios ahead of the finale

The new ad is the latest in a series of high profile TV campaigns aimed at promoting the store's stable of big name fashion designers.

Among those whose clothes appear in the ad are Jonathan Saunders, Aliza Reger and Henry Holland, with the latter declaring himself 'delighted' with the new campaign.

'I'm so excited to be included in the new Christmas campaign,' said Holland. 'I was delighted to see the product showcased so beautifully in the stunning ice rink scene outside the Budapest castle – bring on Christmas!'

Debenhams' festive advertising campaigns have become a key part of its year, with the 2012 effort helping to make its 'hero piece' - a Jonathan Saunders Edition red coat - become the department store's fastest selling outerwear ever, courtesy of a 400 per cent rise in sales.

Stylish: The campaign focuses on Designers at Debenhams and includes everything from coats to party wear

This year, it hopes to repeat the trick with a £160 Hammond & Co Nelson 
coat from Patrick Grant for him  and a Jonathan Saunders Edition 
Crombie coat, £159, for her.

'These two coats are ones to watch,' says Debenhams marketing director Richard Cristofoli.

'Beautifully designed, they
 are the consistent thread throughout the journey. Based on the success 
of our hero red coat from last Christmas, our merchandising teams have 
been working hard to guarantee good stock levels in preparation.'

'It’s a real thrill to see the Hammond 
& Co clothes come to life in the Christmas advert,' adds designer Patrick Grant.

'The Nelson coat 
epitomises everything that’s great about classic English style and it 
seems the perfect fit for our young screen hero.'
