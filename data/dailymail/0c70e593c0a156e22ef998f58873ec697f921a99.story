At the 20-mile mark of a gruelling, rain-soaked marathon, other runners must have been tempted. But only one succumbed.

Rob Sloan flagged down a bus and was driven the six miles to the race’s closing stages.

Then he jumped off, hid behind a tree until other competitors came into view and rejoined the race, crossing the finishing line in two hours, 51 minutes and one second to secure third place.

He went on to tell a TV crew that he had given the race everything he could.

Genuine joy: Rob Sloan shows off his winner's medal in the Kielder 10km the day before illegitimately taking the bronze in the Kielder Marathon thanks to a little help from a bus

Perhaps his thinking was clouded from his earlier exertions, but Mr Sloan failed to spot a very large problem with his plan.

Well, three actually.

First, the bus he caught was for 
spectators following the Kielder Marathon in Northumberland and it was 
likely that several of them might just notice a sweat-soaked runner 
getting on.

Second, the runner who had been in 
third place for the whole race smelt a rat when he crossed the finish 
line and was told he had come fourth.

And third, as race organiser and 
Olympic star Steve Cram put it: ‘He was the only runner in the whole of 
the race who ran the second half of the race quicker than the first 
half.’

Running into trouble: Rob Sloan (pictured in the Blue top, number 1883) appears to be making good progress in the Kielder Marathon, but he later opted to take a bus to the finish line because he was so tired

Inevitably, the truth came out and 
now Mr Sloan has been stripped of his medal, disqualified from the race 
and told he will have to answer questions from a probe by his 
embarrassed running club and UK Athletics.

Race officials said Mr Sloan, who was keeping a low profile last night, had admitted cheating.

The former Army mechanic, who runs 
for Sunderland Harriers, had joined 1,700 other runners at the start for
 the   Kielder Marathon at 10am on Sunday.

Unable to carry on after 20 
miles, Mr Sloan, who had won the Kielder 10km run the previous day, took
 a spectator bus to near the finishing line at Leaplish Waterside Park 
and rejoined the race ahead of Steven Cairns, 43.

Suspicious: Race organiser Steve Cram was baffled by Mr Sloan's remarkably fast finish to the marathon

Mr Cairns, a policeman from 
Edinburgh, instantly suspected foul play. ‘I was in third place right 
from the start so I was stunned when I crossed the finishing line and 
the commentator said, “Here comes the fourth place runner”.

‘I approached a race marshal and 
said, “Fourth? Who was third?” He pointed to this guy Rob Sloan who was 
being interviewed by ITV local news. I listened to the interview. He was
 saying how good a race he had run and how he couldn’t have given any 
more. When the interview was over I asked him if he had finished third 
and he said “yes”.

‘I then asked him where he had passed
 me and he said he’d done so after the 15-mile mark, which was 
impossible because at the point I had opened up a five minute gap.

‘He didn’t say anything. He just 
turned away and walked off. I informed race organisers of my suspicions 
and they said that a couple of other people had seen this guy get on a 
bus, get off a bus and run down towards the finish. He was then seen 
hiding behind a tree before rejoining the race.’

He added: ‘At the end of the day, as 
funny as it seems, he’s stolen my spot on the podium, my TV interview 
and my third place medal.’

Mr Sloan, who is married, initially 
called the accusations ‘laughable’. ‘I’m upset and angry that someone 
wants to cast these aspersions,’ he said.

But Kevin Carr, the chairman of 
Sunderland Harriers, said: ‘It’s blatant cheating as far as I’m 
concerned and as a club we’re going to come down really hard on him.’
