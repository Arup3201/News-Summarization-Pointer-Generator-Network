Her creations became a hit with 
A-listers, including Victoria Beckham and Princess Diana, and in 1998 a 
pair made their way into the script of Sex And The City - turning Jimmy 
Choo into a household name overnight.

After leaving the luxury label that she founded and managed between 1996 and 2011 - she sold her shares for £82.5 million - Ms Mellon has unveiled her very own collection of totes, ready-to-wear and, of course, shoes.

And there's a certain piece in her collection that is really causing a stir: her £1,595 'Sweet Revenge' leather legging boots - which have been worn by none other than Kim Kardashian, teamed with a Givenchy leather ruffled skirt.

Would YOU dare to wear them? The legging boots are being sold on high-end fashion site, Net-a-porter, and Mellon says they're 'flying off the shelves'

The 
£1,595 leather legging boots are a far cry from a dainty pair of Choos.

Mellon describes her leather creation as 'a thigh boot that pulls right up into a legging. You can wear a sweater over it or a big man's shirt and there's no gap.'

Net-a-porter, which is selling the shoe/legging hybrid, writes: 'Designed for a flawless, all-in-one silhouette, each size of this unique style is constructed with either a XS/S or M/L pant - wear yours with a fitted tunic for the slickest take.' 

In an interview with Times2 yesterday, Mellon says the boots are flying off the shelves and while the buyers are mostly young women, one lady in her late sixties snapped up a pair.

The capsule collection also includes a
 £725 leather tote, £550 stretch-wool piqué straight-leg pants and £830 
fringed wrap-effect leather skirt.

And her designs are winning over the fashion world: she's set to open her 
online shop in Britain and she's planning on opening outlets in London 
and New York next year before expanding into Europe and the Middle East -
 Cheryl Cole even wore a pair of her snakeskin metallic blue sandals at 
the X Factor auditions in Manchester.

Her debut range comes soon after Mellon told how her business 
partner did not design a single shoe for the multi-million 
dollar brand named after him.

The businesswoman has re-released her memoir, In Her Shoes, in a paperback version. In it, Mellon opens up about her life in the fast lane and reveals the business and life
 lessons she will pass onto her daughter.

During an interview last year on the Today
 show, the 46-year-old revealed that she never received a sketch from 
him during the years they worked together; 'Not one', she clarified. 

Of course she's wearing them! Kim Kardashian, who has a penchant for leather, has been spotted wearing the quirky design

Unaware
 of Mr Choo's lack of design nous when they joined forces, she said that
 she had to quickly hone her skills and use experience from her fashion 
writing days as accessories editor at Vogue to guide her.

Noting her increasing bitterness about the situation, she writes in her memoirs: 'By the end of 2000, Jimmy Choo was turning a profit of around £3 million a year.

'We had our own London boutique and were represented at 450 more stores, including Harrods and Selfridges.

'To top it off, we'd won a British Fashion Council Award, which Jimmy insisted on accepting on our behalf, even though his design contribution had been nil'

Work the look: Net-a-porter, who are selling the shoe, write: 'Designed for a flawless, all-in-one silhouette - wear yours with a fitted tunic for the slickest take'

Not a design man: Ms Mellon said that Mr Choo, seen with a fashion student, was a skilled cobbler but lacked creative spark

Design process: Ms Mellon said that she would 
come up with ideas and Mr Choo's niece, Ms Choi would sketch them out 
and the two of them would go to vintage stores to look for inspiration

Ms Mellon said from 
there her relationship with Mr Choo deteriorated to the point that any  
conversation was 'out of the question'.

In my shoes: Ms Mellon offers a glimpse into her eventful life in her re-leased memoir, In Her Shoes

In 2001, after much confrontation, Mr Choo sold his share in the company in 2001. 

Ms
 Mellon, who remained with the firm until 2011, said the years that 
followed were tough as she dealt with the death of her father in 2004 
and a divorce from her 'playboy' husband in 2005.

While
 it might have been more sensible for Ms Mellon to have gone into 
business alone, she admits that she met Mr Choo after going through a 
rough period in her life.

'One glass of wine for me turned into 6 o’clock in the morning and calling the coke dealer and then realizing, "Oh my God, I've got to be at work in three hours,'" she recalled.

After losing her job at Vogue at the age 27, Ms Mellon entered rehab. The experience marked a turning point for her. She emerged determined to pursue her dream of starting her own shoe business.

That’s when she reached out to Mr Choo, a cobbler from London’s East End whom she knew from her Vogue days.

Today, armed with a wealth of business experience, she has finally unveiled her own namesake label - and Tamara says she’s the happiest she has ever been, and credits much of it to her daughter Araminta, 12.

Despite
 not even reaching her teenage years yet, Araminta - known more fondly as 'Minty' - is wasting no time 
learning the ropes so that she can one day follow in her mother’s own 
fabulous footsteps.

‘She travels everywhere with me and sits in on all my meetings,’ Mellon tells MailOnline.

‘She’s learning about what I do from osmosis, from actually doing it. And I think that’s the best education. It’s giving her confidence and experience. She’s very smart. If she has an idea, she contributes.’

She continues: ‘My daughter and I bond over the business and decided, together, she’s going to travel with me and be in on my meetings.

‘It’s such a great way for us to bond. I love having her with me, I hate leaving her behind.’

Whether Minty will take over the reigns from her mother one day is still to be decided, however. ‘It’s a little early still,’ laughs Mellon. ‘But she loves fashion. She’s got strong opinions, which I like.

'It’s very good, though I don’t get a say in what she wears. Unless she asks for my advice, I stay out of it!

‘If there was a stage that she was wearing really inappropriate clothing then I would put my foot down, thankfully we haven’t hit that bridge yet!’
