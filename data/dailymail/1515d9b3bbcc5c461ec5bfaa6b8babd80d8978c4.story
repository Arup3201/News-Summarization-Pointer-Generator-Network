Chemist chain Boots is to remove in-store signs advertising science toys for boys after complaints from customers over gender stereotyping on Twitter and Facebook.

Shoppers complained about the high street chain suggesting toys from the Science Museum were for boys.

Yesterday the high street pharmacist said it was wrong to have labelled the toys according to gender, in a statement posted on its Facebook page.

The statement said: 'Thank you to all our customers who have taken the time to share their thoughts with us on the signs we use in the toys and games area of our stores.

'We've always been proud of supporting women in science and in particular in their careers in pharmacy, and we were dismayed that our attempts to help customers shop our store hasn't worked in the way we wanted it to.

'It was never our intention to stereotype certain toys. It's clear we have got this signage wrong, and we're taking immediate steps to remove it from store.'

The campaign to stop the gender stereotyping began after Twitter user Sean E Gray noticed Science Museum toys being labelled for boys and toy tea sets for girls in a Boots store.

Under a sign saying 'boys' toys' were kits from the Science Museum involving magnets, rockets and clocks.  On the next shelf, under the sign 'girls' toys' were mini tea-sets and doll-making kits.

He took a photograph and put it on Twitter, saying 'Not impressed'.  The campaign was taken up by Twitter account @LetToysBeToys, and within hours, the Science Museum had joined the campaign too.

They tweeted: 'We would love for @Bootsofficial to sell our products to girls as well as boys but they need you to tell them'.

The museum added: 'We think science is for both boys and girls but the retailers decide what products they sell.'

Sean E Gray, whose photograph of the toys sparked the campaign that led to Boots changing its signage, told MailOnline: 'I thought I might annoy a manager somewhere enough to change something but I had no idea that there'd be this much support.

'It's fantastic.'

Megan Perryman, of the @LetToysBeToys campaign, said children were interested in a wide range of toys, and it was limiting to both sexes to label toys as for one or the other.

She said: 'We are campaigning about gender signage in toy shops as we know that girls are interested in science and boys are interested in toys that are often labelled 'for girls'.

'It is wrong to deny children access to toys because of their gender.'

Earlier this year Harrods had to apologise after stocking books entitled 'How To Be Gorgeous' with a picture of a pouting girl on the cover and 'How To Be Clever' with a picture of a boy on the cover.

It followed a Twitter storm after the Knightsbridge department store, which had recently redesigned its toy department as 'gender-neutral' sold the books which apparently encouraged girls to 'look stylish' and boys to learn 'incredible ways to remember things'.

Last year the company that makes Lego toy construction bricks was criticised for sexism after producing a line of female figurines that loved parties and animals.

Critics said the purple and pink-packaged Lego Friends range, which had five female characters and sets including a bakery and pet shop, was reinforcing gender stereotypes.

But the Danish firm said its feminine range was hugely popular, and resulted in a 35 per cent profit hike.

Gender-neutral toys such as white, rather than pink, dolls' houses with male as well as female figurines, have become increasingly popular as parents become more concerned about the effects gender specific toys have on their offspring.

Traditionally, little girls have been given tea-sets, toy cookers, and nurses' uniforms, which encourage them to learn that their place is in the home or looking after others, while boys are given tools, vehicles, soldiers and farms.

Researchers say that girls can learn through toy make-up sets and junior hair kits that their value in society depends upon their appearance, while boys are taught to aspire to white-collar occupations when they are given play sets featuring doctors, lawyers and policemen.
