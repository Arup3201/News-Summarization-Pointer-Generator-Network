This new range of footwear brings fresh meaning to choux pastry - fancy high heels made to look like cake.

Designer Chris Campbell has expertly painted dozens of pairs of shoes so they appear to be decorated with buttercream, sprinkles, chocolate and very realistic looking cherries.

The three dimensional aspect to th decoration makes it seem as if you could just pick a cherry, or lick a dollop of ice cream straight from the tasty sculptures.

Every girl's dream: A fashion designer has come up with the perfect footwear for women - heels that look like they are made of cake and icing

Chris has now set up his own shop, The Shoe Bakery, selling the mouthwatering-looking heels and ballet pumps.

Some of his designs include cookies, chocolate and sponge cakes, ice-cream sundaes, red velvet cake, and even gingerbread.

The shoes are so realistic that Chris has been inundated with messages from people asking if they are edible.

And no wonder they look so good, the creations are applied to the shoes with the actual tools used by bakers such as a piping bag and each pair can take between two and four weeks to complete.

Chris, 29, from Orlando in Florida, US, said: 'The idea for cake-themed shoes came from my love for cake and the creativity, and thought that is put into women's shoes.

'One day I thought why not combine those loves together and bring something new into women's fashion and that's how the Shoe Bakery was born.

Personalised: Chris offers a service whereby heel aficionados can order their own shoes from £30

Intricate: The creations are applied to the shoes with the actual tools used by bakers such as a piping bags

'When starting a design we try and think of common desserts and think about how we can transform them into a shoe.

'We then sketch out our idea, get the materials we need together then make the magic happen using an acrylic medium.

'In order to make it look like frosting, we use the same tools that bakers use such as the icing bags and tips.

Carefully planned: He says: 'When starting a design we try and think of common desserts and think about how we can transform them into a shoe'

'People think they are edible all the time. When we first came out with our shoes, most of our time was spent explaining to people that they are not edible.'

A pair of shoes costs between £60 and £200 pounds with custom orders starting from £30.

Perfecting: 'In order to make it look like frosting, we use the same tools that bakers use such as the icing bags and tips,' he explains
