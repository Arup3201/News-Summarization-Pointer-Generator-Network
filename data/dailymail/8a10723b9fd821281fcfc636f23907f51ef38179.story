Click here to read Neil Ashton's interview with QPR midfielder Adel Taarabt

Adel Taarabt's explosive interview with Neil Ashton yielded plenty of memorable lines.

Everything from AC Milan, the midfielder's shirt number and training under manager Harry Redknapp was discussed just hours after the 67-year-old claimed Taarabt was 'three stone overweight'.

Here's 10 of the best quotes...

In a revealing interview, Adel Taarabt said 67-year-old Harry Redknapp spends most of his time in his office

QPR midfielder Taarabt hits back at manager Redknapp's claim that he is 'three stone overweight'

On Harry Redknapp: ‘He spends most of the time in his office but when he gets off the phone he comes down to watch for five or 10 minutes — he never takes a session' ... ‘That’s when he said he had it in mind to start me against Liverpool.’ 

Adel Taarabt's work ethic was challenged by Redknapp, who alluded to the Moroccan having a bad attitude

On 'that' reserve game against Wolves: ‘I played in that reserve game for 90 minutes and if he didn’t think I was running he could have taken me off. Maybe I didn’t perform like I could because it was a reserve team game and I was protecting myself.'

On fitness: 'Maybe he expects me to make more tackles. I am not this type of player. I can only get fitness playing Premier League. You can train six or seven hours, but you won’t be fit.’

Redknapp shakes hands with Taarabt in training in July of last year, after the club had been relegated

On training under Redknapp: ‘The training sessions aren’t the same standard as Milan, or what I would expect under another manager. They are not as intense, the players aren’t as motivated. It is the same as we used to do at Tottenham years ago.

On QPR: 'The problem is we don’t have any plan in the game, we don’t know how to press as a team. It’s not about just running around, you need to play with your brain.'

On Glenn Hoddle: ‘[He] loves me, but I don’t know if Harry listens to him.'

On Les Ferdinand: ‘I spoke with Les Ferdinand and he told me “what a player you are — you should be in the team every time. I followed you at Milan and you were fantastic”.

‘Les doesn’t speak to us in training, but he watches us and then goes to watch the kids as well. He knows me from my days at Tottenham so we have a good relationship.’

Taarabt also says new head of football operations Les Ferdinand regularly praises him

On AC Milan: ‘When I was playing at Milan, sometimes Kaka or Robinho weren’t getting in the team. Then I come to QPR, and that’s not to disrespect my team-mates because I have a good relationship with them, but I was surprised I was not in the squad.'

Taarabt claimed that he kept Brazilian stars Robinho (left) and Kaka out of the AC Milan team last year

On his shirt number: ‘When I came back from Milan, the QPR kitman said “you are no more No 10”. I never wanted to be No 10 but the fans asked the chairman for Adel to be 10 not 7 because of the legend Stan Bowles — they wanted me to have the 10 shirt.

‘They said they had never seen an exciting player like this for 20 or 25 years, so I said to Tony Fernandes I will take it. Then this summer I was told I would be 27 so I said “OK, no problem”. I said nothing.’

On his weight: ‘My heaviest weight at Milan was 86kg (13st 8lb), my lightest 84kg — now I’m 85kg. It’s not true to say I’m not fit. He tried to give an excuse.'
