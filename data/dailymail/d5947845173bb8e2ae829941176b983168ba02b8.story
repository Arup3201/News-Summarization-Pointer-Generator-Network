Graffiti walls and a caravan are just some of the quirky design features in Google Amsterdam's newly renovated office.

The extensive refurbishment used the garage where founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin started Google as inspiration.

The designers have put cardboard box lights on the exposed ceilings and a real-life sixties caravan to spice up meetings, with comfy cushions and vintage furniture.

Graffiti walls and a caravan are just some of the interesting design features in Google Amsterdam's newly renovated office

The extensive refurbishment, by design studio D/DOCK, details quirky elements throughout the work place after using the inspiration of the garage where founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin started Google

Situated in the southern part of Amsterdam, each floor of the office has typically Dutch elements - whether it is the carrier cycle reception desk, the Stroopwafel (waffle made from two thin layers of baked batter with a caramel-like syrup filling) ceiling panels, Gingerbread wall covering or the Delft Blue graphics in the restaurant.

Design studio D/DOCK adhered to Google's healthy material list by using non-toxic materials only and designed with a focus on energy and water consumption.

Google's Healthy Food programme ensures well-balanced menus in the restaurant, seating up to 80 Googlers.

Every work station is adjacent to the window affording all employees a 180Â° view overlooking the city while working

The gym, meditation room and the 
desk bikes all offer the opportunity to their employees to stay in 
shape, both physically and mentally.

According
 to D/DOCK's partner Coen van Dijck, the Amsterdam office is a feel good
 office, he said: 'It is a place that makes the employee perform better 
by offering a work environment that meets their needs.

'Happiness,
 comfort, flexibility, relaxation, well balanced nutrition, exercise, 
daylight, fresh air and visual stimulation are some of the fundamentals 
that makes this office a healthy one.'
