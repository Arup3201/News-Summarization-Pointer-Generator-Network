A family cheated death after their VW Golf convertible burst into flames on the school run - just a day after they bought it on eBay for £800.

Nicky Keefe had driven her partner and three children a quarter of a mile from their home in Cheam, Surrey yesterday when the car started smoking.

But the problem wasn't spotted until her son James, 14, noticed his trainers were melting - and shouted: 'Mum, my feet are on fire!'

The family collected the 19-year-old car from a private seller in Hampshire on Sunday. 

Yesterday morning, Mrs Keefe saw the smoke coming from the grills but assumed it might be normal for an old car so she turned on the heater to clear the windscreen. 

Then James, who was sitting in the passenger seat, noticed his Vans shoes were beginning to melt.

Mrs Keefe's partner, Kevin Keogh, was in the back with James' two younger siblings, Mia, 10 and Harry, 12. 

Fortunately, no-one was injured. 

Mrs Keefe, a primary school teacher, said: 'We got out of the car and told the people behind us our car was on fire. Then suddenly it was engulfed in flames.' 

She said: 'We are in shock but we are all safe. That's the main thing.

'They were quite a nice, normal couple. I think they are going to be quite shocked that this has happened.'

The 19-year-old Golf Cabriolet was listed on the auction site with a starting price of £500 but sold for £810 

The former owner described it on eBay as having a 'few dings' but added 'it has lots of years left in it'

A selling point of the four-seat convertible was that it had less than 95,000 miles on it and MOT until next year

The former owner added the car is 'great fun to drive in the summer or winter with the heated seats'

She added her partner was checking their insurance to see if they were covered, and would also contact eBay about the incident.

The MK3 Golf Cabriolet, which has 95,000 miles on it, was listed on the auction site with a starting price of £500 - but sold for £810.

The former owner described the car as having 'a few dings here and there' but claimed 'it has lots of years left in it'.

The description reads: 'Please don't expect a new car because it's not, but it has lots of years left in it and great fun to drive in the summer or winter with the heated seats.'

Firefighters were called to the scene just after 8.20am. Police closed Lower Morden Lane in Surrey while officers removed the car.
