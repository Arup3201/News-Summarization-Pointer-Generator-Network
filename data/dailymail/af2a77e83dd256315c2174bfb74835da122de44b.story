The suspect has been identified as 31-year-old Eric Matthew Frein, of Canadensis, Pennsylvania

The suspect who shot two troopers outside a rural barracks is a survivalist who has expressed a desire to kill law enforcement officers and commit mass murder, according to Pennsylvania State Police.

Matthew Frein, 31, of Canadensis, Pennsylvania was identified as the suspect by State Police Commissioner Frank Noonan.

He lives about 20 miles from Blooming Grove Barracks in Pike County that were attacked on Friday, leaving one trooper dead and another wounded.

Noonan says about 200 law enforcement officials are looking for Frein, but his whereabouts are unknown.

He said Frein is considered armed and 'extremely dangerous.'

'He has made statements about wanting to kill law enforcement officers and also to commit mass acts of murder,' Noonan said. 

'What his reasons are, we don't know. But he has very strong feelings about law enforcement and seems to be very angry with a lot of things that go on in our society.'

Frein was charged Tuesday with first-degree murder, homicide of a law enforcement officer and other offenses.

About 200 law enforcement officials are combing the rural area of northeastern Pennsylvania marked by dense forest, but 'we have no idea where he is,' Noonan said.

A gunman killed Cpl. Bryon Dickson, 38, and critically wounded Trooper Alex Douglass outside the barracks during a late-night shift change, then slipped away.

Authorities were led to Frein after a resident who was walking his dog in a wooded area two miles from the barracks spotted a vehicle slightly submerged in a pond and called 911. 

In the vehicle, police found shell casings that matched those found at the shooting scene, Noonan said.

Investigators also found Frein's Social Security card, a Pennsylvania Game Commission range permit, camouflage face paint, a black hooded sweatshirt, two empty rifle cases and military gear, Noonan said.

The developments come as a nonprofit group offered a $50,000 reward for tips about Friday's deadly assault at the remote post in northeast Pennsylvania. 

Dickson, a seven-year veteran, had transferred to the region from the Philadelphia barracks several months ago.

Pennsylvania State Police Commissioner Frank Noonan said the 'cowardly attack' was directed at state police and a 'very dangerous, armed criminal' eluded quick capture.

'Our troopers were ... shot without warning and really had no chance to defend themselves,' Noonan told reporters Saturday afternoon. 'It has touched us to the core that such a thing could happen'

'Our troopers were ... shot without warning and really had no chance to defend themselves,' Noonan told reporters Saturday afternoon. 'It has touched us to the core that such a thing could happen.'  

Law enforcement officers from at least three states on Saturday searched state game lands surrounding the barracks in Pike County and beyond.

'There has been an exhaustive search conducted by hundreds of members of law enforcement,' said Lt. Colonel George Bivens.

'We have canvassed the wooded areas, neighborhoods. We are convinced this individual is no longer in that immediate area.' The slain trooper was married with two young sons. 

He was described by friends as devoted to work and family. 

They were a committed couple,' Melissa Contorno, a friend of Dickson's wife, told The Times-Tribune. 

'They were raising a beautiful young family. It's not fair.'
