Britain and its allies were accused by Russia today of using blackmail in a bid to secure a new UN resolution that would authorise the use of force in Syria.

The extraordinary allegation by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov came as Syrian troops and rebels clashed repeatedly inside the tightly controlled capital Damascus in what activists called some of the worst fighting since the country's crisis began 16 months ago.

In a major boost for the new emboldened rebels, Major-General Adnan Sillu, the former head of Syria's chemical weapons programme, was reported to have defected and taken up a post as head of the joint military leadership of the Free Syrian Army.

The defection would be a boost too for western intelligence as Sillu could have crucial details of the nuclear and chemical weapons programme of Iran, a key Syrian ally.

Russia warned today it would block 
moves to extend a UN monitoring mission in Syria due to expire on Friday
 if Western powers did not stop resorting to 'blackmail' by threatening 
sanctions against Damascus.

Mr Lavrov staked out a tough position
 before talks in Moscow with UN envoy Kofi Annan, dismissing 
international pressure on Russia and China to stop propping up Syrian 
President Bashar al-Assad.

His comments are likely to dash the 
hopes of Western diplomats that Russia is trying to find a face-saving 
way to drop its support for Assad and accept that he should have no role
 in a transition.

The Western-backed British draft 
threatens non-military sanctions against Assad's government if it 
doesn't withdraw troops and heavy weapons from population centres within
 ten days.

'To our great regret, we are seeing 
elements of blackmail,' Mr Lavrov said, 'This is a counter-productive 
and a dangerous approach.'

He said any deal must follow the 
principles outlined at talks between Annan and veto-holding members of 
the Security Council in Geneva on June 30, which Russia takes to mean it
 must not specifically exclude Assad.

'If our partners decide to block our 
resolution no matter what, then the U.N. mission will not have a mandate
 and will have to leave Syria. That would be a pity,' said Mr Lavrov, 
whose country is one of Syria's main arms suppliers.

Diplomats say the intensity of the 
fighting around Damascus and in four other cities underlines the urgent 
need for a diplomatic breakthrough and the continued presence of UN 
monitors.

Fighting in and around Damascus 
briefly closed the highway linking the capital with Damascus 
International Airport to the city's south - an unprecedented 
development, said Mustafa Osso, an activist based in Syria.

'It seems there is a new strategy to 
bring the fighting into the center of the capital,' Osso said, adding: 
'The capital used to be safe. This will trouble the regime.'

An amateur video posted online showed
 the embattled suburb of Kfar Souseh as the sound of intense gunfire 
could be head in the distance. The presidential palace, on a mountain 
overlooking the capital, could be seen in the background. The 
authenticity of the video could not be independently confirmed.

There have been sporadic clashes in Damascus in recent months, although Assad's forces remain firmly in control of the capital.

Many of the Damascus suburbs, 
however, have risen up against the regime, prompting a ferocious 
response from the military in an attempt to clear out rebel fighters 
from the towns that ring the capital.

A Damascus resident said black smoke 
could be seen all over capital since Sunday. The resident added that 
shooting and bombing can be heard and that security forces deployed 
along with the army all areas in the city.

On Sunday, United Nations observers 
gathered new details on what happened in a village where dozens were 
reported killed in a regime assault.

After a second visit to Tremseh on 
Sunday, the team said Syrian troops went door-to-door in the small 
farming community, checking residents' IDs and then killing some and 
hauling others away.

According to the U.N., the attack appeared to target army defectors and activists.

'Pools of blood and brain matter were observed in a number of homes,' a UN statement said.

Meanwhile, the UN humanitarian 
office's operations director John Ging said the Syrian president's 
regime has refused entrance visas to aid workers from Britain, Canada, 
France and the United States.

He said 'tremendous political 
obstruction' by Assad's government has hindered the United Nations' and 
other international organizations' aid efforts.
