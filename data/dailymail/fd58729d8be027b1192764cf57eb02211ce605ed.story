With strong walls and heavy artillery, it was New York's last line of defence against the Germans during two world wars.

But nearly 100 years after it was built, Fort Tilden has been transformed into a graffiti-plastered wildlife sanctuary.

The fort, situated in Gateway National Park on the Rockaway Peninsula, now features an array of brightly-coloured phrases and drawings on its walls, ceilings and floors.

Abandoned base: Established in 1917, Fort Tilden was New York's last line of defence against the Germans during two world wars. Above, the fort's infrastructure

Military history: Built as a U.S. Army Coast Artillery Post, the fort protected the American military against the German Navy during the wars. It later became a Nike Hercules and Nike Ajax missile site (as pictured in 1969) and remained under military control until 1974, when it was taken over by the National Park Service

Once home to armour, artillery and American soldiers, its abandoned military buildings have become havens for local graffiti artists and art groups.

Meanwhile, its surrounding beaches, sand dunes and maritime forest have become immensely popular with New York bird-watchers and fishermen.

Karen Johnson, 56, who spent the weekend photographing the abandoned military base, deemed its transformation a striking tribute to U.S. servicemen.

'I can't speak for all New Yorkers, but this New Yorker loves Fort Tilden,' she said. 'I’m fascinated with the graffiti within the buildings 
and the contrast of bright graphic colours with decaying architecture.

'Fort Tilden stood guard, protecting New York harbour and the people of New York City during World War I and World War II.

'The fort, as well as the men and women that served there, have a special place in my heart because of this.'

Bursts of colour: 'I’m fascinated with the graffiti within the buildings and the contrast of bright graphic colours with decaying architecture,' added the photographer

Ms Johnson, who works as an attorney during the week and photographs derelict buildings at weekends, described Fort Tilden's coastal location in the New York borough of Queens as 'beautiful'.

'People don't realise how vulnerable 
our harbour and coastline was during both wars, until you see the size 
of the housing they kept these huge guns in,' she said.

'Fort Tilden sits on one of the most pristine beaches in New York and is home now to a wildlife sanctuary. I see beauty in it and I'm never scared.'
