It was a case of third time unlucky for Brendan Rodgers as the Liverpool boss once again failed to get the better of Jose Mourinho – the man who once mentored him in his roles as academy and reserve-team coach at Chelsea.

Liverpool took the lead after Emre Can’s strike deflected in off Gary Cahill with nine minutes gone but Cahill then struck at the opposite end five minutes later before Diego Costa scored the decisive goal midway through the second half.

Rodgers lost both outings against Mourinho last term, and the Liverpool boss would have been desperate to avenge the 2-0 defeat they suffered at the hands of the Blues which ultimately cost his side their first title in more than two decades.

He made seven changes from the side that lost against Real Madrid in the week with captain Steven Gerrard, £16million Mario Balotelli and England international Raheem Sterling among those recalled.

And the home side certainly had the better of the opening exchanges before Mourinho, who drafted in Ramires to provide Chelsea with a steelier feel, saw his side settle into the match.

Costa’s strike with 66 minutes gone was no more than the visiting side, who are unbeaten in their opening 11 matches of the Premier League campaign, deserved.

Rodgers threw on Rickie Lambert for the ineffectual Mario Balotelli in the closing stages, but the former Southampton man was unable to have any impact on a resolute Chelsea defence, led by captain John Terry.

The hosts were unfortunate not to be given a late penalty when Steven Gerrard’s left-footed strike appeared to hit Cahill’s arm.

But in truth Liverpool didn’t do enough to really test the league leaders and are now already 15 points adrift of Mourinho’s side.

In an interview with Sportsmail during his time at Swansea, Rodgers said: ‘Jose was simply a wonderful influence on my career. He couldn’t do enough to help a hungry young coach.

‘He was always interested to hear my opinions and to share his. As a young coach, you are forever indebted to people like that, who become such an influence on you.’

Rodgers and Mourinho shared a joke and an embrace in the build-up to the lunchtime kick-off; their respect for one another still clear.

But their handshake at the final whistle was less amorous. It’s three games and three defeats for Rodgers and his mentor certainly holds the upper hand.
