She has been immortalised in everything from paint to plasticine and bronze.

Now the Queen is set to make a guest appearance as a cartoon character in the phenomenally successful children’s show Peppa Pig.

The royal guest star is even seen joining in Peppa's favourite activity,
donning her wellies and jumping in muddy puddles – with a tiara on her 
head.

Making a splash: The Queen appears in a Jubilee special of Peppa Pig wearing wellies and playing in the mud

The show - to be screened on television next month - is designed to get 
young viewers involved in Diamond Jubilee activities and Buckingham 
Palace say they are ‘aware’ of the programme.

The Queen's appearance marks the first time a human character has featured in the series.

In the episode, Peppa's friend, Miss Rabbit, is selected to receive an 
award for her hard work and brings along her friends to Buckingham 
Palace for her once-in-a-lifetime experience.

Cartoon fan: Buckingham Palace sources say the Queen is 'aware' of the sketch. It has also been revealed that the Monarch regularly sits down with her grand-children to watch CBeebies

The edition will be screened on Channel 5's Milkshake! on June 4 and released on DVD.

A book based on the episode, entitled Peppa Meets The Queen, is also being published by Ladybird.

Peppa Pig producer Phil Davies said: ‘As a British production, it's only
fitting that Peppa Pig pays tribute to the Queen and we couldn't resist
the opportunity to put her into the show.

‘We hope that everyone enjoys watching the episode as much as we enjoyed
making it and that it gets children into the Jubilee party spirit.’

Buckingham Palace sources told the Mail that the Queen was ‘aware’ of 
the cartoon and had been sent an advance copy of the show in which she 
stars.

Remarkably the 86-year-old monarch is surprisingly clued up on 
children’s television as she frequently watches it when she goes to 
visit her grand-children, Lady Louise, eight, and four-year-old James, 
Viscount Severn, whose parents are Prince Edward and the Countess of 
Wessex.

It is understood that she frequently sits down with them to watch 
CBeebies favourite Justin Fletcher aka Mr Tumble – known to millions of 
parents up and down the country.

‘I have no doubt that the Queen is aware of Peppa Pig through her grand-children,’ a well-placed source said.And the royal guest star is even seen joining in Peppa’s favourite activity, donning her wellies and jumping in muddy puddles.

The show - to be screened next month - is designed to get young viewers involved in Jubilee activities.
