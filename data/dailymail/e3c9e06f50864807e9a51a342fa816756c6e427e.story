Stepping out for the first time since Cleveland kidnapper Ariel Castro's suicide last week, victim Michelle Knight beamed broadly for the cameras as she attended at Cleveland Browns football game today.

Attending the opening game of the NFL season with family and friends, Knight, 32, has so far declined to comment on the death of her captor one month into his 1,000-year prison sentence for holding her, Gina DeJesus and Amanda Berry as sex slaves for almost a decade.

While Knight did not change that stance, her appearance at the game along with her family indicated her recovery is coming along, despite reports that all three girls have mixed feelings about Castro's death.

Stepping out for the first time since Cleveland kidnapper Ariel Castro's suicide last week, victim Michelle Knight beamed broadly for the cameras as she attended at Cleveland Browns football game today.

Dead: Ariel Castro's body is set to be claimed by his family today after he hanged himself in his prison cell on Tuesday

The women have made a handful of public appearances since they were freed and Miss Knight spoke at Castro's sentencing last month.

MailOnline revealed on Tuesday has Castro's 
victims have mixed feelings about the suicide of the man they spent ten 
years of their life with due to the warped bond they shared with him.

Relatives
 of Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight said the girls are happy they can 
finally put the traumatic episode beside them but also experienced some 
confusion when they heard the news.

Jackie Figaro Roman, an aunt of Gina DeJesus, told MailOnline that both girls were going through a ‘mixture of emotions’.

She
 said: ‘There’s so many mixed feelings about it. Gina is a little 
confused. We are trying to protect her because we have to remember, she 
was a 14-year-old girl (when she was kidnapped).

'But Gina and Michelle won’t have to think about him because he’s not around any more.’

Freed: Amanda Berry, left, Gina DeJesus, center, and Michelle Knight, 
right, have all spoken out about recovering from their horrific ordeal 
being kidnapped, raped and tortured by Castro. They have declined to comment on his suicide

She also revealed that Gina’s mother Nancy has been able to move beyond her anger and is already pitying Castro.

'Nancy probably feels bad for him. We
 have a very strong, spiritual family and so does Ariel Castro. She 
doesn’t care about him, she’s just happy her daughter is home. She 
doesn’t feel any anger.'

Amanda Berry - whose daughter is fathered by Castro - has also not commented on his death.

Though
 Castro serially abused the women physically, emotionally, and sexually 
on a daily basis, they were also so badly manipulated they developed 
'Stockholm syndrome' - slowly 'bonding' with their captor in gratitude 
for rare small favors he would grant them.

His suicide will have come as a slap in 
the face to his victims and their families, robbing them of 
the justice that had brought some form of closure to their ten-year 
nightmare.

Lonely death: This is an isolation cell at Correctional Reception Center in Orient, Ohio, like the one where Castro hanged himself on September 3

Castro
 was being housed alone in an isolation unit for his protection, where 
he would be checked every 30 minutes.  Prison officials said he hanged 
himself with a sheet during a break between inspections.

Initially,
 Castro was being checked on every ten minutes, but this stopped in June
 after he was deemed not to be a risk to himself and taken off suicide 
watch. An autopsy confirmed his death was suicide by hanging.

Castro's attorneys tried 
unsuccessfully to have an independent psychological examination of the 53-year-old 
done at the Cuyahoga County Jail before he was turned over to state 
authorities following his conviction.

A full investigation is underway as 
to how he was able to take his own life while under the watchful eye of 
prison guards - who said he was always calm and cooperative with them.

While
 his defense attorneys said they are suspicious as to why their client 
would have committed suicide just one month into his prison term, 
Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Timothy J. McGinty issued a scathing 
statement.

'These degenerate molesters are cowards. They con and capture vulnerable
children,' he said.

'This man couldn't take, for even a month, a small portion of 
what he had dished out for more than a decade.

'Let
 this be a message to other child kidnappers: There will be a heavy 
price to pay when you are caught. You won't enjoy the captive side of 
the bars.'

House of horrors: This is the four-bedroom home where Castro kept his victims for a decade - unbeknown to his family or his neighbors

Restraints: A rusty chain can be seen over a dirty mattress on the floor of the room Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight shared

Basement: The pole the girls were all chained to and raped many times throughout their time in captivity is pictured

As well as his four elder children, 
Castro fathered a young girl to victim Amanda Berry. It is unclear if 
the child knows her father is dead.

Castro
 was jailed after keeping Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight
 captive in unimaginable conditions in his house for ten years.

When prison guards found Castro hanging in his 8x12 foot cell on Tuesday, they immediately began trying to resuscitate him.  

He
 was taken to Ohio State University Medical Center, where he was 
pronounced dead about an hour and a half later - shortly before 11pm.

It
 costs nearly $25,000 a year on average to house a prison inmate in 
Ohio.

The cost to house Castro, who was kept in high security, would 
likely have been much higher.

Castro's family - he has a son and three daughters by his ex-wife - were informed of his suicide about 1am.

A
 spokeswoman for the the Ohio Department of Corrections said the agency 
will make a full investigation of Castro's suicide to determine whether 
regulations were followed and if anything could have been done to 
prevent his death.
