Virginia senator Steve Martin has described women as being merely 'hosts' for their unborn babies, in an anti-abortion Facebook rant that will do little to court his female fan base.

The Republican went on to claim women should not have the right to end their pregnancies in an angry response to a note from pro-choice advocates on Valentine's Day.

'I don't expect to be in the room or will I do anything to prevent you from obtaining a contraceptive,' Martin wrote. 'However, once a child does exist in your womb, I'm not going to assume a right to kill it just because the child's host (some refer to them as mothers) doesn't want it.'

Martin, the former chairman of the Senate Education and Health Committee, voted for Virginia's mandatory ultrasound bill and supported a fetal personhood bill, which would ban all abortions and could affect the legality of some forms of contraception.

His state's Pro-Choice Coalition wrote in the generic card that they were disappointed, on behalf of women's health advocates across Virginia, with his choice to vote for such bills.

'All women deserve access to their full range of reproductive health options - including preventing unintentional pregnancies, raising healthy children, and choosing safe, legal abortion - and your votes only make it more difficult for Virginians to plan and provide for their families,' the note went on.

Offensive: The degrading reference to pregnant women as hosts sparked outrage and he later changed it to the not much better phrase, 'bearer of the child'

It then concluded: 'Please don't break our hearts.'

But Martin snapped back, with a lengthy post on the social media website about where women could stick their reproductive health options.

'If it's your expectation that I should support such nonsense, I will be breaking your heart,' he wrote before referring to the pro-choice group as 'really sick people.'

The post, originally shared on February 17, received nearly 100 likes.

However, the degrading reference to pregnant women as hosts sparked outrage on Twitter, with many accusing Martin of waging war on women and some women posting pictures of themselves with signs stating 'I am a person.'

In response, Martin changed the word 'host' to the not much better 'bearer of the child' though he retained the charming '(some refer to them as mothers)' for good measure.
