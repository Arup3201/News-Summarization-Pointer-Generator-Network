One of two young Australians on death row in Bali has lost his final bid for clemency and is now likely to face death by a firing squad. 

Myuran Sukumaran, 33, was informed his plea for clemency had been rejected after a letter was hand-delivered to Bali's Kerobokan prison by an Indonesian government official on Wednesday, News Corp reports. 

A prisoner in Indonesia typically only learns of their impending execution 72 hours in advance, according to a report submitted to the United Nations Human Rights committee.

Myuran Sukumaran, 33, was informed his plea for clemency had been rejected after a letter was hand-delivered to Bali's Kerobokan prison by an Indonesian government official on Wednesday 

The letter, which was dated December 30, 2014 and has Indonesian president Joko Widodo's name printed underneath, claimed there was not enough reason for Sukumaran's clemency bid to be granted. 

The rejection letter eliminates almost all legal options to stop convicted the Bali Nine heroin smuggler's execution.

Sukumaran and fellow Australian Andrew Chan have been on death row since they were convicted for their involvement in a plan to smuggle 8.2 kg of heroin from Bali to Sydney in 2002.

Chan has yet to receive a decision on his clemency plea.

'My mum's on the floor, tears, crying and can't talk. My sister is in tears and can't talk. My brother's so shocked he didn't even know what to say. I've been walking around feeling like someone's punched me in the stomach,' Sukumaran told Fairfax Media via an intermediary.

'What use will executing us be? We don't deserve to be executed. Our families shouldn't have to suffer like this,' he said. 'Is there no such thing as rehabilitation??? Can't someone change????' 

The two men have lost all their appeals against the death sentence and were relying on the presidential clemency to protect them from facing the firing squad.

It comes as President Widodo made it clear he wanted all 64 drug smugglers on death row to be executed and has ordered a number of them to take place this year.

Inmates on death row in Indonesia are executed by firing squad.

A prisoner has the choice of standing or sitting. They also can decide whether to have their eyes covered.

Firing squads are made up of 12 people: three have rifles loaded with live ammunition, while the other nine are loaded with blanks. 

The squad shoots from a distance  between five and 10 meters. 

A prisoner only learns of his impending execution 72 hours in advance.

Sukumaran launched an art workshop so they could auction prisoner art behind bars to raise money for the prison. He also entered a self-portrait in the Archibald Prize last year.

The 33-year-old was instrumental in setting up graphic art, English and computer courses at the prison.

It is not clear how Sukumaran's recent clemency rejection will affect plans to lodge an application for judicial review.

This appeal can be lodged when there is new evidence, but according to Fairfax Media lawyers are unsure if this can go ahead after a clemency bid has been rejected.  

Sukumaran’s Melbourne-based lawyer Julian McMahon has not ruled out going back to court saying the merits of his case needed proper consideration.

He said the Indonesian Constitutional Court stated during Sukumaran's case on October 30, 2007 that a rehabilitated prisoner should be re-sentenced rather than be executed.  

'Successive prison governors have said that Myuran and Andrew have done such good work in prison, so much rehabilitation work of themselves and others, that they should not be executed,' Mr McMahon told News Corp.

'What does it say about a system of clemency where the most rehabilitated prisoners who do the most good in prison face execution? Does anyone seriously think that Indonesia’s serious criminals are on death row?' 

Sukumaran himself questioned the Indonesian justice system, arguing that serious drug dealers are able to walk free through bribery.

'All the big drug dealers are free and clear to do what they want cause they pay people off big time! That is the only thing me and Andrew can't do, is to pay big money,' he told Fairfax Media.

The Indonesian Government is currently debating a law that will determine how many times prisoners can apply for judicial reviews.

Chan, who has also appealed for clemency, is studying to be a pastor and runs the jail's church.

Daily Mail Australia revealed last month Chan had masterminded another international heroin smuggling attempt out of Hong Kong, which was to run at the same time as the Bali Nine drug operation. 

Chan enlisted Sydney teenager Rachel Diaz, 17, and Chris Vo, 15, as drug couriers to smuggle $1 million worth of heroin in condoms, which they were to swallow in Hong Kong and bring back to Australia.

After his own arrest in Bali, Chan wrote a letter to Diaz in Hong Kong ordering her to keep her mouth shut.

Diaz, Vo and their minder Hutchinson Tran, 22, were arrested in a low budget Hong Kong hotel room on April 12, 2005.

They were found with 114 condoms filled with up to 1kg of heroin - but Diaz had had second thoughts about taking part in the operation, for which they were to be paid $200 for each 5cm-long condom they injested.

Diaz's father Ferdinand failed to get his daughter released on bail and 12 months after her arrest, she was sentenced to 10 years and eight months. Vo, by then 16, received nine years, and Tran got 13 years and four months.

All have since been released, with Diaz serving out the majority of her sentence in a NSW women's prison after being transferred in February 2009 under the International Transfer of Prisoners' Act. 

Five days after her arrest, Bali police arrested Chan, Sukumaran and their mules Renae Lawrence, Martin Stephens, Scott Rush, Si Yi Chen, Matthew Norman, Michael Czugaj and Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen. 

The seven couriers recruited by Chan and Sukumaran received sentences ranging from 18 years to life.
