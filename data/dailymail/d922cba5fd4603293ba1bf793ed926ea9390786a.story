Two former schoolgirl friends are getting married after one of them had a sex change to become a man - and they are now expecting a child.

Toni Harper, 22, met Sean Horton, 25, through friends when they were aged 12 and 15 and he was a blonde girl called Sian.

They became good friends and Sean 'came out' to Toni after years of torment about his gender and sexuality.

Sean started hormone treatment and the pair fell in love  as his voice lowered and he grew facial hair.

Trainee mechanic Sean is just one operation away from the end of his treatment and the couple will tie the knot next month after winning a wedding in a competition.

Childhood sweethearts: Toni Harper and Sean Horton became friends at school when Sean was a blonde-haired girl called Sian - they are now set to be married after Sean underwent a sex change

First meeting: Toni was 12 years old (pictured) when she met Sean, who was then a blonde 15-year-old called Sian

The pair are also about to start a family thanks to a sperm donor and Toni is due to give birth four weeks after their wedding.

Sean, from Knowle, Bristol, said: 'When I was younger I always wanted to wear boys' clothes. My mum just thought I was a Tomboy until I told her the truth.

'Now I just can't wait to be a dad. I can't wait to hear him call me "daddy".'

The couple became friends while at school and grew so close that Toni was the first person Sean told that he wanted to be a man.

He then later revealed his feelings to his mother Heather, 51, who fully supported her son.

She said: 'He came back with a new short haircut - it was around his 16th birthday - and he ran in with a hat on and buried his head in his pillow.

'He poked his head out from under his hat and just said "this is me". It was breaking his heart, I could tell.

'I cuddled him and he said to me "you don't understand, I'm a man".

'Later he just came out and said it - he wanted a sex change. I said "whatever you want, we will be there for you".'

The family approached their GP to find out about having a sex change and he was referred to London's Gender Identity Clinic.

Sean said: 'I had to prove to [doctors] I was living as a man and my college, where I was studying mechanics, even wrote a letter to say I was considered Sean, not Sian.'

After months of meeting a psychiatrist to confirm he was making the right decision, he began hormone treatment, aged 20, and met up with Toni for the first time in two years.

Engaged Toni, a worker at Marks and Spencer, said: 'He suddenly had facial hair and his voice had dropped down really low - I couldn't believe it was him.

'It felt weird at first, but we started seeing each other more and more until we started going out and growing closer and closer.

'When Sean first told me, I asked him how that could be possible. It was so difficult, but I knew what was going on deep inside.'

Sean had a full mastectomy and then a year later he began genital surgery - a series of four operations including one where medics took skin from his arm.

'After the first surgery I was in shock,' he said, 'But now I couldn't be happier.

'I used to dread getting dressed and seeing myself in the shower when I was a woman but now I have never felt more comfortable in my own body.'

The engaged couple had artificial insemination treatment with donor sperm in a bid to get pregnant, spending £8,000 at a private clinic on three unsuccessful attempts.

Future dreams: Sean says he always knew he was a man and is now eagerly looking forward to becoming a father

The pair also planned a wedding but put it on hold after Sean's father Martin was diagnosed with cancer.

In a cruel twist of fate they got the news they could have further insemination treatment on the NHS the day Mr Horton passed away from cancer.

Toni then became pregnant with the baby boy, which due on Mr and Mrs Horton's wedding anniversary.

The couple are getting married next month after they won a £12,000 wedding through local paper, The Bristol Post.

Excited groom Sean said: 'I believe this is fate falling on us. He wanted his first grandson as bad as we did, but when he was here we had three failed attempts.

'Then, after he passed away, we managed to get pregnant on the first attempt. We couldn't believe it. Toni said she will never forget my face when I found out.'

Toni added: 'It was the longest two weeks of our life after the insemination.

'We had tried before. It had been so hard and so disappointing. But we were so relieved in the end.'
