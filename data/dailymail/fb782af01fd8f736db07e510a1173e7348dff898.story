I am lying in a crisp white bathrobe on a vast and comfortable bed, channel flicking through the flat-screen television and nibbling on a bowl of nuts and olives while awaiting my dinner.

A glass of chilled white wine is on its way, along with a beer for my husband Duncan. 

The environment screams chic boutique hotel, right down to the feature wallpaper and expensive toiletries in the bathroom - except, that is, for the custom-made crib and changing station parked beside my bed. They're for our three-month-old baby Connie - not that she's with us at the moment: instead she is on the other side of the robustly soundproofed door, being looked after by a calm and cheerful nanny.

With a 'sun room', yoga studio and airy dining room served by a top-notch chef, I feel like I'm on a baby-free spa minibreak, and in some ways I am, were it not for the fact that my daughter is kicking away in her cot just down the hall. Then again, it would be hard to put an exact label on this experience: the Mermaid Maternity Retreat is such a new concept that it doesn't really fall into any obvious category.

One part hotel spa and two parts nursery and clinic, the Mermaid bills itself as a unique new service aiming to bridge the gap between hospital and home for bewildered new mums, as well as offering on-going services for the first few months of your baby's life. It's the first of its kind in the UK, and if it's a success the owners hope to roll the model out nationwide.

The idea is the brainchild of Nick Balfour, a London businessman and father of four  - who also happens to be the son of Princess Elizabeth of Yugoslavia, which in turn makes him second cousin once removed to Prince Charles.

He came up with the idea six years ago following the birth of his third daughter at The Portland, the private maternity hospital in London beloved of celebrities and high rollers  - and where a standard birth package costs around £15,000, with extra nights coming in at £1,000-plus.

'The figures didn't add up,' Nick recalls now. 'It's a great hospital, but what you get for your thousand pounds a night is just a hospital room – with everything else costing extra.

'I realised that once the professionals have done their job and helped you bring your baby into the world there was nothing between hospital and home, a place where new mums could be nurtured in an environment by qualified people who understood their needs.' 

The result, four years in the planning, is a fourteen-bedroom venue, complete with nursery, yoga studio and treatment rooms situated in the heart of London, above a department store on Chelsea's Kings Road. 

If you sign up for the Mermaid package, you get a private transfer from hospital, all meals in your heavily fortified room, breastfeeding support, a daily midwife visit and babysitting facilities, should you fancy popping to the spa room for a pedicure. Husbands are welcome too.

There's also a blue-chip support team onside, some with royal links of their own. Among them are Vicki Edgson, one of the country's foremost nutritional therapists who has worked with Sarah Ferguson, who offers pre and post birth nutrition advice, and Maggie Howell, who is rumoured to have provided the hypnotherapy birthing CDs used by the Duchess of Cambridge to prepare for the birth of baby George (not, of course, that she will possibly comment on this).

Of course, none of this comes cheap. A night here costs from £595 -  a lot of money for the average new mum who is eking out maternity pay, furnishing the nursery through Ebay and buying budget moisturiser to save money for nappies.

For these women, I suggest, the idea of spending nearly two thousand pounds on a three-night maternity minibreak seems about as likely as doing fifty star jumps moments after giving birth - especially when most have such a strong nesting urge that they want nothing more than to go home, pull the duvet over their head and summon their mums. The women who can afford it meanwhile, are already staffed up the eyeballs.

That, Nick tells me, is missing the point.  'Of course some women want to go home, wherever home is  - but we are here for the ones who don't.  The reality is that NHS discharges women routinely six hours after a normal birth and one or two nights following a caesarean.

'It's medically safe to do so but that doesn't mean that a woman doesn't need to be supported rather than just sent home and left to her own devices. We're here to offer that support in a peaceful and calm environment, to allow you to recover,' he says.

'The reality is that a room here is cheaper than the cheapest room at a private maternity hospital in London and far nicer than a private hospital room in an NHS hospital, which can also cost hundreds of pounds.'

I find it hard to argue with that. Knowing I was to give birth by elective caesarean I had enquired about a private room at my hospital, London's St Thomas, because it would have enabled my husband to stay the night, something that isn't allowed on the general maternity ward.  One was indeed available -  but only if I was prepared to stump up an eye-popping  £900 a night.

Many hospitals do offer cheaper private rooms, but most come in around £200-£300 a night – and for that you get little more than a room with a hospital bed and functional bathroom. 

Against that backdrop the Mermaid costings feel more palatable, although there will of course still be many women who think that if you have that kind of money to spend you would be better of hiring a maternity nurse who can look after you in your own bedroom.

Then there's the singularly emotional business of having a baby itself. While any new mum is welcome the Mermaid is, largely, aimed at us first-timers – and the fact is that no-one really knows how they will feel after they've had a baby until - well, they've had a baby. I had a lovely time during my two-night stay, catching a snooze in my pristine white room  while the mother and baby team fussed over Connie and indulging in the food from their undeniably delicious menu. 

Duncan and I even hoofed off to the pub one evening leaving Connie in the capable hands of the night nanny - but then I was three months into motherhood and not as emotional and fearful as I was after I had just given birth. For the same reasons I was able to fully benefit from all the other services on offer, from an indulgent pedicure to a nutrition consultation and a cranial osteopathy session with the Mermaid's team of experts.

Winding the clock back to when I had given birth, it's hard to know whether I would have been able to fully appreciate everything on offer – and whether I might  have found myself yearning for my own bed, even if the sheets don't come with a thousand thread count.

Still, it seems plenty are willing to give it a try:  as I leave, the Mermaid team are preparing for the imminent arrival of four new mums with their tiny charges. And Nick, as ever, is ready with an answer.

'We're here for whatever stage you are at, whether it is total newborn or a few weeks down the road. Your needs change of course but we are there for every bit of it. If you just want to sleep you can do so knowing someone is looking after your baby if that is what you would like. If you want support with breastfeeding then we can help you with that too. New mums can have very different needs but we like to think we have thought of them all.'
