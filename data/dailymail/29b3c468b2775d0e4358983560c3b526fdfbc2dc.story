Charged: Robert Gladden Jr., 15, faces 29 charges stemming from his shotgun attack at his Maryland high school

The 15-year-old student who walked into his Maryland high school and opened fire critically injuring a fellow student with Downs syndrome has been indicted on 29 different charges.

Baltimore County prosecutors announced today that a grand jury has indicted Robert Wayne Gladden Jr. on nine counts of attempted murder, nine counts of first-degree assault and nine counts of reckless endangerment. He also faces two handgun charges.

Police say Gladden fired two rounds from an antique shotgun at Perry Hall High School on first day of classes on August 27.

One classmate, 17-year-old Daniel Borowy, was critically wounded after being shot in the back, and police believe that the boy was shot at random unrelated to his disability.

The indictment names eight other potential victims, including guidance counselor Jesse Wasmer who tackled the shooter to the floor moments after he opened fire. Police and school officials called Wasmer a hero for wrestling the gun away from Gladden.

The suspect posted to his Facebook profile before last Monday’s shooting, ‘First day of school, last day of my life. F*** the world.’

Gladden allegedly came to school that morning with a bottle of vodka, a disassembled shotgun and 21 rounds of ammunition.

Gladden, who was charged with first degree attempted murder the day after the incident, has a Facebook page littered with chilling references to killing.

He lists Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, the students who carried out the 1999 Columbine High School massacre where 13 people died, as ‘inspirational people.'

Gladden also has a title of ‘Murder Suicide’ next to his name and has listed notorious murderers -The Manson Family - under his ‘Work and Education’ section.

The student, who is being charged as an adult and also faces a second charge of first-degree assault, describes himself on Facebook as a 'metalhead.'

‘I’m a metalhead and that’s about it,' he has written in the 'Information' section. He lists heavy metal bands and musicians, including Marilyn Manson and Slipknot, as his favourite artists. Gladden's father has said that his son was bullied at school.

Police have said Gladden took a shotgun, which was over 40 years old, and a bottle of vodka into the school.

Gladden, who is being held without bail, has a preliminary hearing has been scheduled for September 7.

After police searched Gladden's home yesterday, the student's stepfather, Andrew Piper, was arrested on charges unrelated to the shooting.

Piper was charged with illegal possession of weapons and drugs at his home in the 8500-block of Bradshaw Road.

Meanwhile, students and parents in the Maryland community are crediting a high school guidance counselor with saving the school after he heroically restrained the gunman before he could fire any fatal shots.

Baltimore County Police Chief James Johnson said the gunman fired once before he was grabbed by Guidance 
counselor Jesse Wasmer, and then another shot went off and hit the ceiling as he struggled with Wasmer and other teachers.

Shooting: A 17-year-old male student was shot in the back by another student at Perry Hall High School in Baltimore on Monday morning; it was the students' first day back

Jordan Coates, a 17-year-old student who was in the cafeteria at the time of the shooting, said the student used a shotgun.

Coates said he watched teachers, including Wasmer, pin the shooter against a vending machine.

'My back was to the door. I heard a 
pop and thought it was a bag because people do that, but then I heard 
another one,' Coates told The Associated Press.

Savior: Wasmer, pictured with his wife Elizabeth, grabbed the gun from the student and held him until other teachers came over

'And I turned around and
a teacher had a kid pinned up against the vending machine, and I saw 
the barrel, and another shot goes off and people just start running.'

Coates added that Wasmer 'grabbed the gun from the kid and got him' until other teachers came over.

Wasmer, 31, a graduate of Perry Hall who also coaches lacrosse, was married over the summer.

Later on Monday, Twitter erupted with tributes and messages of thanks for the guidance counselor.

One tweet read: 'Mr Wasmer is the man!!!! Never take him for granted bcuz (sic) he risked his life for over 2,000 of us.'

Another said: 'If Wasmer wasn't there, imagine what would have happened. Thank God for him.'

A Facebook page called 'Thanks Mr 
Wasmer' has nearly 10,000 'likes' and is full of messages of support and
thanks for the heroic guidance counselor.

Some students, who witnessed the chaos, said that there was a scuffle right before the shooting.

'I
heard two large bangs and I saw people running and it was chaos and 
everybody ran outside, and the principal told us to stay in the grass 
area and away from the cafeteria,' a student told WJZ.

Miranda Wienecke, a junior, told the Baltimore Sun that she saw the suspect with a 'huge black thing' that she suddenly realised was a gun.

'I
saw people getting under the table,' Wienecke said.'Then I saw people 
running. We heard this huge boom, then there was another one, everything
happened very fast.'

Random attack: Officers believe that the shooter, who was also a student at Perry Hall High School, fired at random and struck the teen

Facebook threat: Parents have said that there may have been a threat on Facebook which referenced the school. It reportedly said, 'First Day of School, Last Day of Life'

A woman who was speaking from Gladden's home and 
said she was related to the father, gave the following statement on the 
family's behalf: 'We are horrified. We did not see this coming and our 
thoughts and prayers are with the victim and the victim's family.'

When asked about a motive for the shooting, Gladden's father indicated his son had been bullied. He gave no further details.

The victim remained in critical condition at Maryland Shock Trauma Center and when the school reopened, a brief prayer vigil was held for him.

Detectives were interviewing the suspected shooter Monday afternoon, Baltimore County police spokeswoman Elise Armacost said.

Investigators were also searching Gladden's home for an hour and a half yesterday and were seen carrying out some guns, reported the Baltimore Sun.

Gladden's stepfather, Andrew Piper was arrested on charges unrelated to the shooting. He was charged with illegal possession of weapons and drugs at his home in the 8500-block of Bradshaw Road.
