After years of speculation, streaming service Netflix will officially launch in Australia on March 31 with unlimited movies and TV on offer starting from as little as $9.99 a month, new leak reveals.

Tech Guide reports that the date and pricing were confirmed by a source during the International Consumer Electronic Show in Last Vegas this week.

'We attended a briefing with Netflix yesterday and they refused to answer any specific questions about the Australian service including the launch date and pricing structure,' the report said.

'Our information was confirmed by another source.'

But a Netflix spokesperson has told Daily Mail Australia that they could not comment on the 'rumour or speculation'.

'Details of the local Australian launch have yet to be announced,' a Netflix spokesperson said. 

While the launch date and price  is yet to be confirmed in Australia and New Zealand by the on-demand giant, it is understood that some popular TV series such as Orange is the New Black will not be available to stream on Netflix when it launches in Australia due to agreement in place.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Netflix and Foxtel but neither are willing to confirm about the future of Netflix's original programming in Australia.

Netflix has already triggered thousands of Australians, who are reportedly accessing foreign versions of Netflix via virtual private network technology, which alters their IP address.
