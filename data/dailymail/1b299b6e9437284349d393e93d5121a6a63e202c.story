The NYPD released Sunday a shocking new video showing a shooting in broad daylight on a busy New York City street.

In the surveillance footage released to Gothamist, a man in his twenties is seen walking along the sidewalk about 6:30pm Friday in Brooklyn's crime-ridden Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood.

The man walks down Nostrand Avenue casually â€” and then steps off the sidewalk, pivots to face an unseen target off camera and reaches into his pocket.

That's when it happens: the suspect brazenly fires at least once from the street onto the sidewalk.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

He quickly walks away and crosses the street, his body jerking momentarily as he appears to either be struck by something or to have been surprised by his gun's recoil.

Off camera, police say, the suspect shot a 20-year-old man who had been standing near 263 Nostrand Ave. on the leg.

It is unclear if the men knew each other.

NYPD has not released a motive for the crime.

The suspect is described as a clean-shaven twentysomething with medium build and a short haircut.

Police asks any information relating to the crime be sent to Crime Stoppers at 800-577-TIPS.
