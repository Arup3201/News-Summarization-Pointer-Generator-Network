A Polish toy manufacturer has declared that it will continue to sell its line of Nazi-themed toys despite public backlash.

Speaking from Warsaw, Cobi Toys CEO Robert Podles insisted that keeping such dolls and games on shelves offered a 'fun' way for children to be taught history.

'We believe that through good fun we can teach history and we will continue this line in the future, Podles says in the video.

'We cannot separate this from history,' he continued.

'Our history, our whole European history, unfortunately has imbibed this Nazism from the Second World War and we cannot escape from that.’

The toys sold by the company involved Nazi tanks, soldiers and other military items, as well as Soviet, American and British toys. 

The statement from Cobi comes on the heels of a recent decision from Swedish department store, Gekås in Ullared, to cease stocking the Nazi-inspired toys.

Gekås CEO Boris Lennerhov explained: 'This is not something we want to promote as form of ideal.'

This isn't the first time that a store has been faced with such a decision over Nazi-emblazoned products.

Spanish clothing retailer Mango issued an apology in October over a shirt with small lightning symbols, which customers believed looked similar to the symbol used by the Waffen SS.

Clothing chain Zara was likewise forced to pull a sheriff jersey in August, following complaints that it closely resembled concentration camp attire.  

In the video, Podles also points out that the company manufactures Soviet, America and British WWII toys

'Our whole European history has imbibed this Nazism from the Second World War,' Podles said
