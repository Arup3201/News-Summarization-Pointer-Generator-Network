Jose Mourinho has responded to a six-year-old Aston Villa fan's written request to manage his struggling side.

Young Villa fan Jude Branson took pen to paper to make the plea last week, before Paul Lambert was sacked following Tuesday's 2-0 defeat by Hull City, and the Chelsea manager has now replied by sending him an autograph.

Sadly for the youngster (and Aston Villa fans in general), the Special One's signature was written on a photograph of himself and not a contract to become the next manager at Villa Park.

Who will replace Paul Lambert as Aston Villa manager? 

In his message, Jude wrote: 'Dear Mr Mourinho, My name is Jude. I am 6 years old and I support Aston Villa. You are my favourite manager. Please could you manage Villa and bring Costa with you? We need help. Thank you Jude Branson.'

'Jude had a nice surprise today when he came back home from school to find that Jose had sent him a signed picture addressed to himself,' his father Phil told the Birmingham Mail.

'The only thing he wanted from his letter was Mourinho to take over at Villa.

'He he didn't get that! So the next best thing for him is definitely this acknowledgement from the man himself.

Paul Lambert's reign as Aston Villa manager finally came to an end following a 2-0 defeat by Hull City

Tim Sherwood is the front-runner to replace Lambert and was also favourite for the QPR  job

'It'll be framed and put on his bedroom wall. It's good to know that his letter was read and maybe even planted the seed in his head which will lead him to the Villa job one day. This is an excellent way to end a brilliant few days for Jude.'

Defeat against Hull has left Villa in the relegation zone without a Premier League win in 10 games dating back to December 7.

The search for Villa's next 'available' manager has began with Tim Sherwood the bookies' favourite while Jurgen Klinsmann, Steve McClaren and Glenn Hoddle are also being mentioned as potential candidates.
