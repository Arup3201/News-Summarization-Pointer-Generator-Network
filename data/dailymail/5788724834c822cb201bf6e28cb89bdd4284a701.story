A nine-year-old Ohio girl has been found dead in a dumpster near her home and a neighbor has been arrested in connection with her murder.

Reann Murphy's body was found just hours after her family reported her missing at 8:30 p.m. Saturday.

Police arrested Jerrod Metsker, described as a neighbor and family friend, for Reann Murphy's murder.

Reann Murphy was last seen around 
5:30 p.m. Saturday playing outdoors at the mobile home park where she 
lived in Smithville, about 30 miles southwest of Akron. Her family 
called Wayne County Sheriff's Office to report her missing around 8:30 
p.m. and officers reported to the girl's home.

Sheriff's deputies, firefighters and 
residents began a frantic search for her. But the hunt ended in tragedy 
when deputies found her body in a dumpster at 1:30 a.m. Sunday, about 
five hours after she was reported missing.

Sheriff Travis Hutchinson said in a 
press conference Sunday afternoon that his office arrested 24-year-old 
Jerrod Metsker at around 1 p.m. and plans to charge him with aggravated 
murder first thing Monday.

He is a neighbor in the 
trailer park and an acquaintance and friend of the girl and her family, 
Hutchinson said, adding that a witness spotted Metsker with the child.

Metsker
was arrested at his home after he ignored knocks on his front door and 
deputies obtained a key from a family member, Hutchinson said.

Police have given limited details about
the evidence that led them to the man and say they haven't yet 
uncovered a motive. Metsker is being held in police custody.

Metsker lived in a trailer about 50 yards from where Reann Murphy lived with her family.

His
Facebook page reveals little about what could have prompted him to kill
a child, but his garbled and misspelt status updates indicate someone 
with a poor education and a love of video games.

'i feel like that people need to be nice to people even know if thay are rich or pore if you are mean were dose that get you know were if you are nice you get a lot moor in life,' reads one.

According
to Fox 8, there are between 15 and 20 trailers inside the park and the 
dumpster where Reann was found was in the middle of the courtyard near 
the trailers.

He said 
Reann's 'violent death' was 'troublesome' and that investigators would 
leave no stone unturned in the case. Agents with the Ohio Bureau of 
Criminal Investigation have been called in to help.

'Any violent death is troubling but the death of a child is much more so. We will leave no stone unturned as this investigation continues,' he said.

The department didn't immediately respond to requests for further information, including how Reann was killed.

Wayne County deputies along with 
members of the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation Unit have been on the 
scene since early Sunday.

BCI Special Agent Supervisor Dan Winterich told FOX 8 that 
detectives are interviewing the girl's neighbors to see if they saw or 
heard anything Saturday night.

Reann's body has been removed from the scene and an autopsy will be conducted to find out how she died.

'All she did was love people,' Reann's father, Richard Murphy, told The Daily Record in Wooster. He said that he wanted the 'worst for the guy' who killed his daughter and declined to comment further.

Wayne County prosecutor Dan Lutz said: 'Obviously, all of our thoughts and prayers go to the family. It's a horrific thing to take place at any time but especially before the holidays.'

Marilyn Briggs, who lives in a house next to the mobile home park, said she didn't know Reann or her family but was shaken by the girl's killing.

'It sickens me and I'm so sad for the family, and this close to Christmas,' Briggs said. 'It's just awful. You never think something like that is going to happen in your area.'

Briggs described the park as a bit run-down but generally safe and added that she wasn't aware of any serious crimes in the area in the eight years she's lived there.

A candlelight vigil has been scheduled for 6 p.m. at Smithville park Sunday evening in Reann Murphy's memory.

A grief counselor will be available at the little girl's school Smithfield Elementary for staff and students.
