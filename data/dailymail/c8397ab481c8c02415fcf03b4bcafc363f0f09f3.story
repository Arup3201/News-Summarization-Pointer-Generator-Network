A woman and her boyfriend have been charged with beating to death a 15-month-old girl they were babysitting.

North Carolina's Malaya Faith Heun died on January 22, two days after a brutal assault which left her unconscious with ruptured intestines, broken collarbone, fractured ribs and brain bleeding.

Malaya's aunt Alisha Nicole Carlisle, 20, and Carlisle's boyfriend, 30-year-old John Travis Turner, who were caring for the toddler, were charged with first-degree murder on Monday.

'Just seeing their faces makes me angry,
 to know that they would do something like that to my daughter,' Jamie Heun, Malaya's grief-stricken father, told Independent Tribune.

'My daughter’s gone. I’m always going to have to deal with that fact.'

Malaya was unresponsive when she was rushed to hospital on January 19 after, police say, she was beaten by Carlisle and Turner.

The couple were babysitting the toddler while her mother Christy Heun, Carlisle's sister, was at work.  They had moved in with the Heun family in December last year, according to WCNC.

Malaya underwent emergency surgery, but her mother took her off life support on January 22 when the infant's condition worsened.

An autopsy finalized last month revealed Malaya suffered 'repeated inflicted
 trauma consistent with Battered Child Syndrome'.

The cause of the innocent girl's death was listed as 'septic shock due to
 complications of inflicted blunt force trauma to the abdomen'. Her colon was perforated and surgeons had to remove multiple portions of her bowel.

In addition to fresh fractures, the child had numerous broken ribs and bruises in
 various stages of healing, indicating she had been abused over an extended period.

'The brutal murder of Malaya Heun
 … was one of the worst cases of child abuse I have seen in over 30 
years being a police officer,' Kannapolis Police Chief Woody Chavis said
 in a statement released Monday.

'I have seen many abused and battered 
children during my career but this one was extremely disturbing knowing 
how much this baby must have suffered before she died.'

Malaya's devastated mother, Christy Heun, has come under fire by observers questioning how she failed to notice her sister was allegedly abusing Malaya.

Christy Heun, a mother-of-four, said he was at work, trying to support her family, when the attack happened, and that she typically worked 18 hour days up to six days a week.

'That was my sister. I left her with people I thought I could trust,' she told WCNC. 'He (Turner) is the reason she (Carlisle) didn't protect my baby.'

Tragic: The family of Malaya Faith Heun, who died on January 22 after being savagely beaten, are 'ecstatic' that her alleged attackers have been arrested and charged

Police on Monday charged Turner and Carlisle with first-degree murder, felony child abuse and assault with a deadly 
weapon inflicting serious injury.

The pair are being held without bond in the Cabarrus and Rowan County Jails, respectively.

Turner was already in jail on unrelated charges, according to Independent Tribune.

The duo are scheduled to appear in Rowan County Court on Wednesday.
