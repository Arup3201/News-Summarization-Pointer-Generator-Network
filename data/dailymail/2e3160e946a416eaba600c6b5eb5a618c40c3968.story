DeAndre Yedlin insists he is ready to return to Tottenham and challenge for a place in the first team to help turn around the disastrous start to their season.

The 21-year-old right-back agreed a deal to join Spurs from Seattle Sounders in the summer then was loaned back to the MLS side.

But Tottenham have an agreement that they can recall the player in January and with the club 12th in the Barclays Premier League and struggling with life under new manager Mauricio Pochettino that is looking increasingly likely.

Yedlin is seeking talks with Pochettino while he is in London, having travelled here to play in USA's friendly against Colombia being held at Fulham's Craven Cottage on Friday night.

'I've been trying to keep up with what's happening,' Yedlin said. 'I'm focussing on my season and what I'm doing, but I have been keeping up with them as well. Trying to keep in touch.

'I feel I'm ready wherever I'm put, I'm ready to step in, whether that's coming in and playing and challenging for a spot or coming in and having to work a little bit until I get a chance. I haven't spoken to Mauricio Pochettino but while I'm here I'll look to do that.'

Although he is yet to speak to the Argentine, he has, however, spoken to his national team boss Jurgen Klinsmann, a Spurs legend, about what he can expect when he properly moves to White Hart Lane.

'He played at Tottenham and told me it's a great club with great tradition,' Yedlin said. 'I'm excited to get over here. I just need to keep progressing in what I'm doing.'

Yedlin is expected to play in USA's friendly. By Thursday afternoon 23,500 tickets had been sold for the match, equalling the record for an international at Craven Cottage set by the Brazil versus Ghana friendly in 2011.

Yedlin believes that will be the perfect opportunity to show off his ability to English fans, adding: 'I think so, people will be watching. I'm looking to have a good performance.'
