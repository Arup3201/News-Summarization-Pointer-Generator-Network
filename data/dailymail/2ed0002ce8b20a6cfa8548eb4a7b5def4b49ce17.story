Brutal: Human rights lawyer Samira Salih al-Nuaimi (pictured) was publicly executed in the Iraqi city of Mosul after she criticised ISIS on Facebook

ISIS terrorists have publicly executed a human rights lawyer in the Iraqi city of Mosul after she criticised the group on Facebook for destroying religious monuments.

Samira Salih al-Nuaimi was seized from her home on September 17 shortly after she allegedly posted messages on Facebook that were critical of the militants' destruction of religious sites in the city.

According to the United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq, al-Nuaimi was tried in a Sharia law court for apostasy, before being tortured for five days and eventually being sentenced to public execution.

News of al-Nuaimi's shocking death emerged after a coalition of American and Arab forces carried out a third night of deadly airstrikes against ISIS targets which have already killed scores of militants.

Al-Nuaimi was killed on Monday, according to a statement released by the UN mission today. Her Facebook page appears to have been deleted since her death.

'By torturing and executing a female human rights' lawyer and activist, defending in particular the civil and human rights of her fellow citizens in Mosul, ISIL continues to attest to its infamous nature, combining hatred, nihilism and savagery, as well as its total disregard of human decency,' Nickolay Mladenov, the UN envoy to Iraq, said in a statement, referring to the group by an alternative name.

The militant group captured Iraq's second largest city Mosul during its rapid advance across the country's north and west in June, as Iraqi security forces melted away. 

The extremists now rule a vast, self-declared caliphate straddling the Syria-Iraq border in which they have imposed a strict interpretation of Sharia law which they claim justifies massacring opponents.

In the once-diverse city of Mosul, the group has forced non-Muslims to convert to Islam, pay special religious taxes or face execution -  a policy that has caused tens of thousands to flee.

The militants have also enforced a strict dress code on women, going so far as to veil the faces of female mannequins in store fronts.

In August, the group destroyed a number of historic landmarks in the town, including several lavish mosques and shrines, claiming the locations promoted idolatry - the practice of worshiping objects or icons  instead of God.

It appears to have been this campaign of destruction that led al-Nuaimi to post the critical Facebook messages that ultimately resulted in her death.

The Gulf Center for Human Rights yesterday said that al-Nuaimi had worked on issues relating to poverty and the rights of detainees while living and working in Mosul.

The Bahrain-based rights group said her death 'is solely motivated by her peaceful and legitimate human rights work, in particular defending the civil and human rights of her fellow citizens in Mosul.'

Extreme violence against women who do not conform to the group's primitive ideals is a hallmark of ISIS' approach to governance.  

In the nearby town of Sderat, militants broke into the house of a female candidate in the last provincial council elections, killed her and abducted her husband, according to the UN. On the same day, another female politician was abducted from her home in eastern Mosul and remains missing.

ISIS' brutally oppressive treatment of its four million citizens, as well as the sickening filmed murders of two American journalists and a British aid worker, eventually prompted the US to launch airstrikes against the group in western Iraq last month, and in its Syrian stronghold earlier this week.

The U.S. Air Force has worked alongside a coalition of five Arab nations - Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, Qatar and Jordan - in an effort to degrade and eventually destroy the Islamist terror group.

Desperate militants are believed to have freed 150 prisoners in the group's de facto capital Raqqa overnight, in the hope it will convince America and its Arab allies to end the airstrikes.

The militant stronghold is widely thought to be a base for the group's senior figures - including leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi - and where British hostages Alan Henning and John Cantlie are being held.

The news came as a fresh wave of airstrikes from the United States and its Arab allies hit ISIS oil refineries overnight, killing at least 14 militants and striking at the heart of the terror group's funding.

ISIS generates up to $2million a day from the sale of oil, employing highly trained engineers to extract thousands of barrels a day from the vast swaths of Syria and Iraq under the terror group's control.

Nearly a dozen countries have also provided weapons and training to Kurdish peshmerga fighters, who were strained after months of battling the jihadi group.

In other developments Thursday, German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen visited northern Iraq for talks with Kurdish leaders about the fight against Islamic State extremists and Berlin's efforts to help with arms deliveries.

Thursday also marked the start of German arms deliveries to the semi-autonomous Kurdish region, with the ultimate goal of supplying 10,000 Kurdish fighters with some 70 million euros ($90 million) worth of equipment.
