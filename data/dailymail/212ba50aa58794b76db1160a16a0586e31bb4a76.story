A 73-year-old who killed a cyclist when she accidentally hit the accelerator instead of the brake at a junction has been spared jail.

Marjorie Tappenden admitted causing death by dangerous driving after mowing down former semi-professional cyclist Kevin Lane, 52, who had been on a 70-mile training ride.

The pensioner 'panicked' and hit Mr Lane from behind before sliding into a U-turn with the victim caught beneath the car in Woodford Green, east London.

Her Nissan Pixo  came to a halt on the grassy verge  when it hit a bollard and Mr Lane was pronounced dead at the scene in February last year, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard. 

Young mother Rachel Cochran who witnessed the crash, said she heard Tappenden crying 'I meant to press the brake, I pressed the wrong pedal,' and said it was clear she was in some distress.

She said the car suddenly leapt forward and changed from a normal sound to a heavy revving as if someone had accelerated very hard. 

Tappenden was given a 12-month supervision order, banned from driving for three years and ordered to pay a victim surcharge of £80.

Mr Lane's partner Angela Cook said: 'Kevin was my best friend and my life partner and he was taken away without me even having a chance to say goodbye.

'He wasn't someone who just commuted to work by cycling, he loved cycling, he used to be semi-professional and knew everything about cycling.

'He would often chase after drivers and tap on the window and warn them to look after cyclists on the road, he was a very careful cyclist.'

Mrs Tappenden and her husband, who suffers from advanced Parkinson's disease, had been on their way to visit their daughter in Harlow at the time of the crash.

Karen Robinson, prosecuting, said: 'Mr Lane, as a cyclist, was a vulnerable road user and he had the right of way at the time.

'He was an experienced cyclist, he was riding a well maintained bike and he was training for an upcoming cycling event and he was wearing bright clothing. 

Tappenden, who was interviewed under caution shortly after the crash, told police she must have pressed the accelerator rather than the brake, and had swerved to try and avoid Mr Lane.

Ms Robinson said: 'The pressing of the wrong pedal continued for a long period of time and carried on even after her husband had told her to remove her foot.'

Defence attorney Brenda St Prix told the court that Tappenden is a full-time carer for her husband who is almost bedbound, and that she has vowed never to get behind the wheel of a car again. 

'She's still having difficulty sleeping since the incident, her doctor has asked her to go on a stronger dose of anti-depressants but as sole carer for her husband she doesn't feel she would be able to do that as it would have an effect on her ability to look after him,' she said.

'She's shown remorse and you have seen a copy of the pre-sentence report, so we say that the only aggravating feature was that the cyclist was vulnerable - it was pedal confusion and a momentary lapse.'

Judge William Kennedy said: 'There's nothing I can say to make things better - this is a tragedy for both sides and I am desperately sorry for the situation you all find yourselves in.

'For reasons she can't explain, when she got to the junction she quite simply pushed the wrong pedal, instead of coming to a halt the car shot across the junction and collided with Mr Lane.

'Of course it took a few moments for the car to stop and these moments took Mr Lane's life.

'The whole thing was a single error with these dreadful results and Mrs Tappenden is certain that she will never drive again.

'There are no winners here, there are only losers in this room, motor vehicles are lethal instruments and those who drive them are expected to do so with skill and care and so far as is possible that maintains the safety of those on the road.

Tappenden is a full-time carer for her husband who suffers from advanced Parkinson's disease and is almost bedbound 

'This wasn't a question of someone who drove over a long period carelessly, unaware or uncaring of other people on the road - it was a few seconds that had desperate consequences.'

'The probation service have heard her remorse and whilst she says this whole thing is a blur blotted out in her mind she will think about this incident every day for the rest of her life.

'From the very first moment she has admitted that she was responsible for this death and I don't think I could say or do anything to this elderly lady more eloquently than she says to herself.

'All of us that drive a car have at one point or another suddenly realised that for a second or two we have not concentrated as much as we might.'

'I am not sending this 74-year-old woman to prison and it's not within my power to do so, it would not be just to do so.

'I order supervision for 12 months because this woman is going to need the support of someone else to deal with that which has happened to her.'
