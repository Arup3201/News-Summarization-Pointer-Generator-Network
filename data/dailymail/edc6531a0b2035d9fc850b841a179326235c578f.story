Shady: Tony Caplin was made chairman of the Public Works Loan Board by David Cameron

A vineyard owner cheated out of £100,000 by the Tory crony put in charge of billions of pounds of public money has denounced the bankrupt businessman as a  ‘devious b******’.

Bill Hulme, who owns the Fleur Fields vineyard in Northamptonshire, backed calls for an inquiry into disgraced ex-Tory chief Tony Caplin, who was put in charge of Public Works Loan Board by David Cameron.

‘There is something wrong with the judgment of a Government that puts a bad man like that in charge of public money when he has duped innocent people like me and others out of enormous sums,’ said 71-year-old Mr Hulme.

‘The man is a devious b****** and had all the hallmarks of a conman. There should be an inquiry to establish the truth.’

Meanwhile, another businessman today speaks of how Caplin conned him out of another £250,000.

The Mail on Sunday revealed last week how Caplin, who ran the Cameron family stockbroking firm, was made chairman of the £60 billion quango despite being declared bankrupt. Mr Cameron claimed he had no idea the ‘quango king’, who owed more than £3 million, including £200,000 to the taxman, had been made bankrupt – and fired him immediately.

We also revealed Caplin’s link to disgraced Iain Corby, former boss of a publicly funded Conservative MPs’ research group. Corby, who was sacked on Mr Cameron’s orders over sex texts and boozing claims, secretly emailed Caplin from his Commons office in an apparent bid to profit from a £5 billion deal.

The Prime Minister hoped his instant dismissal of Caplin – who was also the Conservatives’ chief operating officer when Mr Cameron became party leader – would end the row, but The Mail on Sunday has established the scandal is much deeper.

The picture now is of an unscrupulous man in cahoots with shady  figures who cheated innocent people out of vast sums – and tried to lie his way out of it. It raises key questions: why did Cameron trust Caplin with such a vast amount of public money? Did Caplin use his privileged Treasury role to abuse taxpayers’ money? And did friends in high places cover up his activities?

The pressure for an inquiry into Caplin grew after new details emerged of how he:

A vivid account of the misery caused by Caplin is provided by Bill Hulme and wife Flora. They set up their vineyard 14 years ago, which has become one of England’s most successful winemakers – but they were rocked when Caplin cheated them out of £100,000.

They say they were persuaded to lend him the money in 2010 by their financial adviser. What they didn’t know was that the adviser was, like Caplin, soon to be embroiled in a separate financial scandal. Mr Hulme recalls: ‘He said Caplin was worth about £2 million, had deals going through and would soon pay me back, so I agreed.’

The couple say their adviser played up Caplin’s role as former head of Panmure Gordon stockbrokers, which employed three generations of Camerons, including the Prime Minister’s father Ian. ‘It sounded impressive.’ So they lent Caplin the money – but ‘then he stopped paying interest.

‘Another man told me Caplin did the same to him. We were told he was paying cheques into his wife’s account. They are both “A Caplin.”

‘It turned out he already had huge debts when I lent him money. If I’d known I wouldn’t have gone near him.’

Vineyard owners: Flora and Bill Hulme lost out when they lent Caplin £100,000

When Caplin was quizzed at a bankruptcy hearing in February 2012, it seemed he could not even remember Bill Hulme’s name. He said he owed ‘someone called Bill’ £100,000.

The Hulmes’ story was echoed by the boss of a high-tech firm who said he was cheated out of £250,000 by Caplin. The entrepreneur, who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity, told how Caplin boasted of his Tory links.

‘He would say things like, “I had lunch with George the other day.” He was definitely close to Osborne. He said “Theresa [Villiers] told me she wants one of your computers, but can she have it in pink?” Or he’d say, “I saw Oliver [Letwin] at the weekend.” He mentioned Cameron a couple of times.’

The businessman described how Caplin persuaded him to lend him £250,000 – which he is still waiting to get back. ‘I knew he had a senior job at the Tory Party and he was very plausible. He rang me in summer 2010 and asked to borrow £250,000 for a deal. I said, “No problem.”

‘A few weeks after that, he came to France with me. He phoned from Nice airport to say thanks. That was the last I heard from him.

‘When he was taken to court, he said he had money coming in, but he never did. He produced a cheque for £200,000 from a company in Northern Ireland. It was fake. He said he couldn’t attend court because he had a boil on his bum. It was ridiculous.

‘He is a Walter Mitty. He said he had a collection of vintage Fiat cars, but there is no trace of it. He is intelligent, but has a fatal flaw. Perhaps being too close to political power, and the need for money to maintain his position, affected his judgment.

‘Maybe he thought he could go bankrupt, conceal it, reinvent himself and get away with it. He nearly did – until you caught him out.’

When he appeared at the bankruptcy court, Caplin admitted that he paid money earned from his quango work into wife Angela’s bank account, which is also in the name  ‘A Caplin’. Asked why, he said it was ‘easier’ than using his account.

This included his £6,000-a-year payment from the Medical Research Council. Last year he was reappointed as chairman of its finance committee by another Tory friend, Business Minister David Willetts, but he was sacked last week.

Also paid into Mrs A Caplin’s account was the £20,000 a year he received as chairman of the North West London Hospitals NHS Trust.

As he fought a losing battle to avoid bankruptcy, Caplin told the court that he was due to receive £63,000 in weeks from two US clients and $600,000 (£350,000) in two months from US firm Americana Investments.

The money never materialised. He said he had been wealthy before the banking crash, but now had no stocks, shares or savings. His £1 million Cotswolds home had been repossessed by Barclays Bank, he said – and he still owed them £500,000.

Prominent: Caplin at a previous event

Caplin’s current home is a penthouse apartment near the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s Kensington Palace in London. He told friends he bought it last year after selling the Cotswolds home and his £1.85 million home in Fulham. In fact, both were sold to pay off debts.

And he does not own the apartment in Queen’s Gate. Land Registry records show it was purchased last July for £2.4 million by Raj Bansal and wife Urmila Mistry, British doctors practising in Florida. Caplin rents it for an estimated £7,000 a month – and is thought to be facing eviction for rent arrears.

Seven years before his bankruptcy case, the London Stock Exchange publicly reprimanded an investment bank that Caplin chaired for breaking strict City rules.

Durlacher bank and Prestbury Holdings, a ‘boutique bank’ chaired by Tory grandee Francis Maude, were both rapped after Durlacher advised Prestbury to delay announcing a profits warning. When it was finally issued, Prestbury’s shares fell nearly 75 per cent.

Soon afterwards, Caplin contributed to the 2005 Conservative manifesto along with Mr Letwin.

When Mr Maude became party chairman after the Election, he appointed Caplin as the Tories’ chief operating officer at Central Office.

A spokesman for Mr Maude said: ‘Francis Maude did not meet Caplin until later, after the 2005 Election.’

Another of Caplin’s business associates is Ulster property developer Glenn Boyd who, in 2007, faced charges relating to a £1.2 million land deal, including transferring the proceeds of crime and possessing property as the proceeds of crime. Charges were dismissed, but he was struck off as a director until 2022.

Caplin told his bankruptcy court in 2012 that Boyd was due to pay him £250,000 ‘later that day’ – and hoped to earn another £250,000 from him. It never arrived.

Boyd confirmed that he has business links with Caplin, but refused to comment further. Caplin is one of two directors of HFX Globex Realisations, set up last October with Yvonne Anderson – Boyd’s wife – and registered to the couple’s former home in Londonderry. 

Questions to answer: It was Prime Minister David Cameron who made Caplin chairman of the major quango

Caplin is believed to have had the tables turned on him by falling  victim of a $2 billion Venezuelan bond fraud. He set up a company in the tax haven of the Isle of Man to receive millions of pounds in expected interest from investments, but Caplin told his bankruptcy hearing he ‘never received a penny and no bond was ever issued’.

Caplin was discharged from bankruptcy just weeks before his appointment to the quango, but still owes money.

Labour’s Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, said: ‘The more we learn about this man, the more questions need to be answered.’

A Treasury spokesman said: ‘Mr Caplin has not been a member of any donor club and we have no record of him attending any lunches with George Osborne.’

A Government spokesman said Caplin was made commissioner of the Public Works Loan Board after being nominated by the outgoing chairman of the independent board. Caplin was unavailable for comment.
