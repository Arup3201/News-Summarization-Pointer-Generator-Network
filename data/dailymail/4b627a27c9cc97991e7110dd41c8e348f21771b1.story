Christmas is normally a happy time when families enjoy spending the festive season together, while children impatiently await a visit from Santa Claus and the presents he brings.

But these online pictures show that not all children share a love of jolly old St Nick.

In fact, some are actively terrified of him, as demonstrated by these funny snaps posted by parents, presumably seeking to share their pain and get a modicum of revenge on their miserable offspring.

Hat's off: Santa gamely grins for the camera despite the utterly miserable pair's vocal protestations

Santa's grottoes around the world are springing up and most children are happy to sit on Santa's knee and let him know if they've been naughty or nice and what presents they want under their Christmas tree.

But not these sobbing youngsters, who were driven to rivers of tears, clenched fists and ear-splitting screeching as they meet the kindly old Father Christmas.

In most of the pictures Santa gamely smiles for the camera despite the squirming, scared youngster, but in many the viewer will see a resigned hint of the Christmas blues behind the fake beard and grandfatherly specs.

Hopefully their unfounded fears about 
Santa Claus will have disappeared by Christmas Eve and they will 
remember to leave him a nice mince pie and a glass of milk.
