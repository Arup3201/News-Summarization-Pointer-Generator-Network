An Australian wildlife warrior has gone where most people would not dare by filming himself swimming alongside deadly saltwater crocodiles.

Beau Greaves has tried to show off the 'sensitive side' of the predators and released extraordinary footage of him up close and personal with the reptile on his YouTube channel.

The 24-year-old crayfish diver took a dip in the Great Barrier Reef, in Queensland's far north, to capture hours of video, exploring the wildlife it had to offer - including stingrays and wobbegongs, commonly known as the carpet shark.

Beau Greaves has always had a fascination with wildlife and in a new video he swims dangerously close to saltwater crocodiles

On his YouTube page, Mr Greaves said he was a thrill seeker who never did things in halves.

His sister, Ebony, told Daily Mail Australia this had always been the case.

'Beau is a very extreme person, as a little kid we grew up at Lake Cooroibah [north of Queensland's Sunshine Coast],' she said.

'Ever since I could remember he would go out for hours by himself, and trawl up and down the lake and catch all kinds of snakes, spiders and eels and other exotic wildlife.

'One time he came home with a crab attached to his finger when he was five years old.'

Ms Greaves said her brother had an unexplained connection with wildlife, which helped him swim unnoticed by animals.

When asked if she and her family even feared for Mr Greaves' safety, his sister answered: 'Absolutely.'

At no point in the video does the crocodile appear to behave aggressively towards the Sunshine Coast man

He said he had 'absolutely no fear' but he respected crocodiles and does not touch them with hands

'To be honest, he's an extreme person. When he's not catching wildlife, he's into surfing and into extreme motocross riding,' she said.

'He always finds the extreme in everything he does. 

'No matter how worried our family is... he loves what he is doing. 

'I can't ever imagine him being an office person, he loves the wildlife.'

Mr Greaves told The Sunday Mail it was 'unbelievable' to be able to swim so closely with the crocodiles, an act which wildlife experts warned was detrimental to his safety.

'They're just a big old dinosaur, and they've got big teeth too,' the wildlife warrior said.

Mr Greaves is also a reptile carer on the Sunshine Coast and works for nine months of the year diving the coral reefs in remote Cape York for crayfish on a trawler.

He uses his time living in the area to film his wildlife videos and gives him an opportunity to learn about dugongs, snakes, turtles, dolphins and whales.

Mr Greaves believes he had a 'primal connection' with the dangerous beasts, which he helps them remain calm around him.

'I just gauge their mood, and if they're relaxed, it's all cool. I jump in and swim around with them,' he said.

'I love crocs. I've got absolutely no fear. But I do respect them. And I've learnt my lesson not to touch them.'

At one point in the video, the 24-year-old is seen swimming near a stingray with its tail facing the diver.

In a terrifying moment, he reaches out and prods the back of the animal with a rod close to its barb.

A barb through the chest was what killed Mr Greaves' idol, Steve Irwin, who was known as 'The Crocodile Hunter'.

But Professor Grahame Webb, from wildlife sanctuary Crocodylus Park, said Mr Greaves was reducing his life expectancy by swimming so closely with crocodiles. 

'Unless he is Doctor Dolittle and can talk to the animals, he's a croc snack waiting to happen,' Prof Webb told News Corp.

'Wow. He's got big kahunas. But that's really asking for it.'

For those who think crocodiles that live in open water or reefs are not as deadly, Prof Webb said this was simply not the case.

According to News Corp, 10 per cent of the 111 attacks that have happened since crocodile hunting was banned in Australia in the 1970s involved scuba divers, snorkellers or spear fishermen - putting Mr Greaves in the 'very high-risk category'.
