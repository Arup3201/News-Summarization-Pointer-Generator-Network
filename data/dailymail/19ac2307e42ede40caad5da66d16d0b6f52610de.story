Australian allrounder Shane Watson has put his $1.3 million waterfront retreat on the Gold Coast up for sale.

The allrounder bought the four-level townhouse at Mermaid Beach off the plan back in 2006.

The four-bedroom villa has a self-contained teenage retreat and a four-car basement garage.

It also has three bathrooms, open plan living spaces and a family-sized kitchen.

The north-facing 539 square metre villa on Lavarack Road was built by boutique builder, Daniel Veitch, and sold for $1.34 million.

The former Australian vice captain lives in the Sutherland Shire, south of Sydney, with his sports presenter wife, Lee Furlong, and their four-month-old son Will.

They are considered one of the most glamorous marriages of Australian sport, having first met through mutual friends in 2006 and marrying at Bells at Killcare on the Central Coast four years later.

Despite all their success in their respective careers, they called the birth of Will the most 'amazing' moment of their lives.

The Mermaid Beach property, listed through Chez Fraser of Harcourts Coastal, will go up for auction on Saturday.

Average house price in the area are $870,000.

The family-sized kitchen has European appliances and Caesar stone bench tops

The 539 square metre villa has open plan living spaces and a teenage retreat

The property has been marketed on its close proximity to the beach with sea breezes and ocean glimpses

The home has four generous sized bedrooms and three bathrooms

The couple clearly love a home by the sea, calling Burraneer Bay in Sydney's Sutherland Shire home.

In March 2010 they paid $4 million for the luxury home, which is equipped with an infinity pool, a jetty, and spectacular views across the Port Hacking River.
