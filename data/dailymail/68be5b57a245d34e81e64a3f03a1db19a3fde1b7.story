Wigan have signed Cardiff City left-back Andrew Taylor on a three-year deal.

Taylor, 27, captained the Cardiff side that won promotion to the Premier League a year ago but drifted out of the picture following the departure of manager Malky Mackay in December.

Wigan hope that he can help them back into the top-flight after they lost in the play-offs to eventual winners QPR last season.

Departure: Andrew Taylor has left Cardiff to join Championship rivals Wigan

Manager Uwe Rosler said: ‘I’m very, very happy to get a player of Andrew’s stature and experience to our football club.

‘He was the captain of Malky Mackay’s promotion-winning team, he is a very experienced and reliable player who is at the best stage of his career and I’m looking forward to working with him.

‘He has all the qualities in his position that we are looking for; physically, technically he’s very good and tactically he has developed as a player well.

‘He’s willing to go forward, participating in our play offensively and he’s another cornerstone in our team for next season.

‘The quality he’s shown as a player for Middlesbrough and Cardiff is good but in particularly at Cardiff where he was captain of their promotion-winning team; I think that will do us very well as a team in next season’s campaign, especially when we’re bringing in younger players who need experienced players on the side to develop in the best way.’

Dependable: Wigan boss Uwe Rosler signed Taylor for his experience in getting Cardiff promoted

Taylor was a Youth Cup winner at Middlesbrough where he came through the club’s academy alongside the likes of Adam Johnson, Chris Brunt and James Morrison before joining Cardiff in 2011.

He said: ‘Wigan Athletic are a big club, with Premier League experience and big aspirations.

‘The manager seems really good and I think his record when he came to the club last season speaks volumes.

‘It’s a fresh challenge for me and one I’m very excited about; I had three good years at Cardiff but everything has to come to an end and I’m looking forward to getting started at the DW Stadium.’

Promise: Taylor was a Youth Cup winner at Middlesbrough alongside Adam Johnson and Chris Brunt
