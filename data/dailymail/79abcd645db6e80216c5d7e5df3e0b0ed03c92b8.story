A 15-year-old school girl is determined to drop 16 stone in order for her to have gender reassignment surgery.

Raven El Messaoudi has lived as a girl for ten months since coming out as transgender to her family and schoolfriends, and now takes hormone blockers to stop her from adopting male features.

The teenager, from Johannesburg, South Africa, used to live on a diet of McDonald's, fried chicken, and 14 eggs-on-toast a day, is on a strict diet in preparation for her surgery at the age of 21.

Raven suffered bullying at school because of her weight and gender identity and after her teachers refused to allow her to attend as a transgender girl, she is now being home-schooled.

Her mother Diana, 44, has agreed Raven can have sex reassignment surgery as soon as she is 21 and a breast augmentation when she reaches her target weight of ten stone.

‘We both know it's going to take a long time,’ Raven, who is 5ft 2in tall and currently weighs 26 stone, said. ‘But it's good to have something to work towards.’

‘Mum wants me to be sure of my decision to become a woman before I undergo any permanent changes.’

Motivation: Raven has been promised gender reassignment surgery when she turns 21 and a breast augmentation when she reaches ten stone

Mother-daughter time: Raven, seen getting some help with her makeup from Diana, says she loves sharing a wardrobe with her mother

Courage: The 15-year-old stood up on stage in front of her bullies and told them she was transgender

Despite being trapped inside the wrong body, Raven, born as a boy called Sharif, is happy she is allowed to live like a girl.

‘At the moment, I feel like I'm looking through the bars of a prison. I feel like I've been forced to live inside this body.

‘I'm starting to get hair on my lip and chest - it's horrible - so I shave every day.’

She says she is grateful for the support from her mother and brother, especially as other members of the family still insist on calling her Sharif.

Raven was taken out of school earlier this year by her mother.

‘Some people found it hard to accept,’
Raven said. ‘There were rumours going round that I was gay, so I got 
fed up and took to the stage in front of 80 other pupils.

‘I said: “I'm not gay, I'm transgender. I'm a girl stuck in a boy's body and if you can't accept it, then it's your problem.”'

Changes: Raven is pictured as a boy, left, aged 9, and earlier this year, aged 14, when she began living as a girl

Her mother Diana said: ‘When Raven 
grew her hair, the school said she wasn't allowed to sit her exams 
unless she had it cut.

'I took her to the hairdressers and they hacked it
off - and she looked like a boy again. It broke my heart seeing Raven 
so upset.’

On another occasion, Diana discovered that other pupils were planning on throwing pig's blood over her daughter.

Boyhood: Raven says growing up, aged 4, left, and eight, right, she felt she was born in the wrong body

She
said: ‘I knew that they'd been calling her a pig, but I never imagined 
it would be this bad. Children are cruel, but this cruel? I couldn't 
believe it.’

Raven’s battle with her weight started when she began comfort eating to deal with the death of her grandfather.

She
used to eat a fried breakfast of fourteen eggs on toast a day, followed
by a large Big Mac with fries and three cheeseburgers on the side, and 
two McFlurries.

Then she 
would snack on chocolate bars before dining on a huge plate of pasta 
with four pieces of fried chicken, followed by a whole tub of ice-cream 
in front of the TV.

Diana herself weighs 20 stone tells a 
similar tale of comfort eating which began when her husband Hassid was 
shot and killed during a hijack aged 31.

Diet: Diane used to feed Raven 14 fried eggs on toast for breakfast, before Raven would go to McDonald's for a lunch of a BigMac and three cheeseburgers before pasta and fried chicken, followed by a tub of ice cream, for dinner

Diana admits she used to overfeed raven and her 12-year-old brother Ali, who weighs 19 stone.

‘I was trapped in a cycle of comfort eating all the time, and I am sorry I passed that on to my children.’

Raven, who is now on a diet, is determined to reach her goal and fulfill her dream of surgery.

She said: ‘Me and mum share clothes and I'm growing my hair and wearing makeup - it's great.

‘But on top of everything, knowing I have the support of my mum means the world.’

Support: The 15-year-old says she is ready to take on the challenge to lose weight thanks to the backing she gets from her mother and brother Ali
