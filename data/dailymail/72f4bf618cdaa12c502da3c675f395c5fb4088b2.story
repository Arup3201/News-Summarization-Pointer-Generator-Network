Wayne Newton's palatial Las Vegas residence can be yours for $30million.

Yahoo! Homes reported the sticker price is $40million less than what was being asked last year.

Realtor Dale Thornburgh told the website the much lower price is a 'considerable loss.'

Yahoo! Homes reported that Newton's business partner Lacy Harber 'apparently intended to work with Newton and his wife to establish a sort of Graceland West where the couple and their young daughter would continue to live.'

However, the Newtons moved out last year and despite the fact that Harber renovated the property, no one bought it, according to Yahoo! Homes.

Redfin reported that Newton lost the property in bankruptcy to CSD LLC, which was headed byÂ  Lacy and Dorothy Harber.

Newton dominated the Las Vegas show scene in his prime as a singer and entertainer, delivering such hits as Danke Schoen which was famously used as the soundtrack for the movie Ferris Bueller's Day Off.

In flusher days, Redfin reported the crooner's Casa de Shenandoah property featured flamingos, South African penguins and Arabian horses.

Newton along with his family and menagerie moved to a downsized Las Vegas estate, the website revealed.

Redfin noted that the estate comes complete with an actual jumbo jet and a terminal - to see the luxurious beast take off and land - as well as an actual 'car museum' for good measure.

Luxury: The estate - which Newton lost in bankruptcy to CSD LLC - has the nickname Casa de Shenandoah

Tropical: Lagoon style swimming pools with rocky waterfalls are a prominent feature on the desert estate

Equestrian paradise: The sprawling property boasts 37 stables for horses on site

There are 37 horse stables, an equestrian pool and countless arenas for riding, making it an equine paradise if there ever was one.

But horses were not Newton's only fascination, as Redfin explains.

The property has also been home to countless other animals that the renowned entertainer brought home to play and stay, including a plethora of exotic ones.

Lawns for days: Lakes and sprawling greenery used to house a range of exotic animals back when Newton was the owner of the 40 acre property in Las Vegas

Back in the day: Flamingos, South African penguins and Arabian horses used to trot about the estate

Sprawling swimming pools shaped like tropical lagoons and decorated with waterfalls and rock formations provide ample space for splashing about and escaping the Nevada heat.

Newton's career in entertainment was topped off with an appearance on Dancing With The Stars in 2007, during which the singer partnered up with Cheryl Burke.

The Vegas superstar, who is married to attorney Kathleen McCrone, continues to tour worldwide with his music.

The couple have one daughter, Lauren, and Newton has another adopted daughter from his previous marriage to Elaine Okamura.

Not for humans! The owner can make use of this equestrian pool, designed for horses

Anyone for tennis? A somewhat unkempt tennis court occupies a tiny portion of the property

Plenty of room to sleep: Aside from the main house there are also seven separate smaller houses

Waiting to take off: There is a prime seating area where guests can wait to board their jumbo jets

Added extra: The next lucky owner will need to have a pilot on hand - or learn to be one

Splashing about: The property offers plenty of room to take a dip in its sprawling pools

Desert home: The property would reach soaring temperature heights being in Nevada

Relax: Whoever buys the home can enjoy this living room
