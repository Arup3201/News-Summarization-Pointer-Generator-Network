Would-be time travellers could soon own their very own piece of film history - as the DeLorean car used in Back to the Future III goes under the hammer.

The vehicle, used by Michael J Fox's character Marty McFly to travel from 1955 to the Wild West of 1885, is expected to fetch at least $600,000 when it is auctioned off in Hollywood.

Only three of the seven DeLoreans used in the trilogy survive.

Fans with slightly less cash to burn could be tempted by a $20,000 hoverboard, the flying skateboard used by Marty, in the second instalment of the film.

Also on sale are Marty's jacket and the shirt worn by his crackpot mentor, Doc Brown, played by Christopher Lloyd.

The Delorean is currently in private hands and for 10 years was parked in an area of Universal Studios reserved for old props.

It features a high-performance engine, roll bars and a switch on the dashboard that allows the rear tyres to spin while the car stays in place.

Profiles in History, the auctioneer, said part of the proceeds would go to the Michael J Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research. Fox has Parkinson's disease.

Marilyn Monroe's wedding ring from Joe DiMaggio and a pair of ruby slippers worn by Judy Garland in The Wizard of Oz will also be auctioned between December 15 and 17.
