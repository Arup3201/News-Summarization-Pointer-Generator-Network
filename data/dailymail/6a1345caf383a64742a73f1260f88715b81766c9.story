Brendan Rodgers and Liverpool will target an FA Cup victory at Wembley as the perfect send-off for departing hero Steven Gerrard.

Two goals from Gerrard clinched a 2-1 win at AFC Wimbledon last night and set up a fourth round tie against Bolton, in a competition which reaches its climax on his 35th birthday, on the final day of the domestic season.

'It would be nice,' said Rodgers. 'The FA cup final is on his birthday isn't it, and for him it would be a wonderful send-off.

Brendan Rodgers, speaking to Wimbledon boss Neal Ardley, wants to send Gerrard off with an FA Cup win

'There's a lot of games between now and then but the idea is to get a cup if we can do. We've targeted a cup victory and progress in the league this season and if we can do that it would be really special, of course.

'He was outstanding in the game, it was a brilliant individual performance from him and it was the catalyst overall. He scored two and if he was a selfish player might have got on the ball and got a hat-trick.'

It was Gerrard's first performance since confirming plans to leave Anfield when his contract expires at the end of the season. He scored the opener with a diving header and the winner with a free-kick, either side of an equaliser from Adebayo Akinfenwa.

'That's what dreams are made of,' said Gerrard, when asked about a possibility of going out with an FA Cup triumph. 'I always enjoy FA Cup. I grew up loving the competition. It'll be the last time so I want to make the most of it and go all the way.'
