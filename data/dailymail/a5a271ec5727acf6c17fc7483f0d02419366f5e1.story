Daisy the hardy sow is taking a well earned rest after giving birth to an incredible 27 piglets in less than a year.

The Kunekune pig produced a litter of 11 babies at a children's activity farm in February. Nine months on and she has given birth to 16 more.

Her owners think she got pregnant when Charlie the boar escaped from his pen at night and snuck into her enclosure.

Feeding frenzy: Daisy the pig from Dorset with her litter of 16 Kunekune piglets

It is not unknown for female Kunekune pigs to have large litters but the average brood is a mere eight at a time.

The two-year-old mother only has 12 teats and so staff at Farmer Palmers Farm Park near Wareham, Dorset, are bottle-feeding the four smallest piglets every two hours.

And when Daisy isn't feeding the newborns she is usually found slumped face down in straw having a rest.

Philip Palmer, 46, co-owner of the farm, said: 'Daisy is only 4ft long which is significantly smaller than the other Kunekune pigs we have at the farm.

'But despite her size she has managed to produce two very big litters.

'It was a bit of a surprise when she had a litter of 11 earlier this year because the average is about eight piglets.

'We weren't planning on her having any more piglets for a while but our boar, Charlie, escaped from his pen in the middle of the night and got into her enclosure.

'When we discovered what had happened the morning after we realised they must have mated.

'The female's second litter is usually bigger than their first but we never expected it to be 16.

'She started giving birth at 1pm on 
Saturday and by the time the 10th piglet came out, myself and the farm 
staff started exchanging looks.

'There
was a pause at number 14 and we thought that was it but then out came 
the last two. We really weren't expecting that many at all.

'Daisy has gone through the mill of it a bit and could probably put her feet up now.'

Mr Palmer plans to keep two of the smallest ginger piglets, which he has named Rufus and Rodney, and has hoped for them to take part in the attraction's family show.

The others will be sold to other farm parks across the country like many of the 11 older pigs.

It is thought that Kunekune pigs were brought to Britain from New Zealand in the 19th century by whalers and were swapped for goods with the Maori people.

The name 'Kunekune' was given to the hairy pigs by the indigenous tribes, which translates to 'fat and round'.
