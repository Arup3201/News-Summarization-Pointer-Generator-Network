Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho 'lacked respect' for Paris Saint Germain ahead of their Champions League last 16 showdown, according to the French side's captain and matchwinner Thiago Silva.

The Blues were eliminated from the competition on Wednesday night after a 2-2 extra-time draw at Stamford Bridge sent the Ligue 1 side through to the quarter finals on away goals - with Silva scoring the decisive header after conceding a penalty earlier which had given Chelsea the lead.

Back in December, Mourinho had claimed that the French champions were the side he would most like to meet since they were close to home.

Mourinho said in December: 'We don't have much choice, there are only five possibilities, but to make it easy for everybody, I would say Paris Saint-Germain.

'It's easy for us to travel, easy for the fans to travel and they won't have to spend a lot of money to go there. They are a very good team and I would prefer a really good team, which will motivate the boys. So, if I could choose, even though I can't, I would say Paris.'

This riled the Brazil defender who believes Mourinho should have shown more dignity, although he cited last year's defeat, when Demba Ba scored late to send his side out at the quarter final stage of the competition, as the source of motivation.

'It wasn't revenge, but they really lacked respect for us, particularly Mourinho, because he said he wanted to play PSG because it was close and that it was easy for their supporters to travel there,' the Brazil international is cited as saying by RMC.

'But I don't think our display was because of that, it was because of last year.'
