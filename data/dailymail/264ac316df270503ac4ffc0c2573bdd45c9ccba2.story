Business chiefs led by the head of the CBI attacked Ed Miliband yesterday, warning that his ‘politically motivated’ anti-business policies will cost jobs and hold back the economic recovery.

Bosses say Labour’s increasingly Left-wing agenda has led to them being demonised by politicians.

Sir Mike Rake, president of the CBI and chairman of BT, said it is crucial to have ‘the right policies to create jobs for the economy’.

He said: ‘There’s absolutely no doubt that business is concerned about some of the policy statements being made at the moment by Ed Miliband.’

Labour Ed Miliband has promised to intervene in the energy, housing and banking industries, raising fears among some business leaders

A senior FTSE 100 executive said he was concerned that Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls and Labour’s business spokesman Chuka Umunna, who are well regarded by business, are being sidelined by Mr Miliband. ‘People are starting to worry that these policies are not for show but will actually be implemented by Miliband,’ he added.

Speaking to the Daily Mail at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the boss of one of the Big Four accountancy giants sounded the alarm over anti-business sentiment brewing in the UK.

The founder of Pimlico plumbers Charlie Mullins accused Ed Miliband of 'dodgy anti-business rhetoric'.

Charlie Mullins, who has backed the Tories in the past, warned the Labour leader's economic strategy would turn the clock back to the 1970s.

He told MailOnline: 'I’ve been very critical of Ed Balls’ record on the economy, and quite honestly how anyone can be so consistently wrong on employment and growth and not get the boot I really don’t know.

'My best guess is that maybe he’s the fall guy for his boss Ed Miliband. As long as Balls stays on as a buffer, the other Ed’s dodgy anti-business rhetoric is kind of shrouded from view.

'But nevertheless where would we be as business people in this country under a regime headed by a man who doesn’t believe in Capitalism and who’s policies are influenced by the likes of Len McCluskey, the general secretary of Trade Union, Unite.

'I’ve heard it said that he’s just grandstanding for votes like many of the political class, but I actually think he’s more dangerous than that. I think he actually believes that the UK would be better off with the policies for the Labour party from the 1970s and 80s.'

‘Business is nervous that any politician could choose to demonise business as an easy target,’ said Simon Collins, chairman and senior partner of KPMG in the UK.

While Mr Collins did not single out Mr Miliband by name, other company chiefs privately expressed horror at his stated desire to bring back Socialism, carve up the banks and freeze energy prices. A FTSE 100 boss said: ‘Ed Miliband doesn’t give a toss about business. He will say anything to get elected. It is economic vandalism.’

Company chiefs spoke out after a private breakfast with Chancellor George Osborne in Davos. Mr Osborne told the business leaders they must get ‘on the front foot’ to win back the public’s trust.

They emerged to praise the Chancellor’s pro-business agenda and said they were increasingly confident about the British economy.

Mr Collins, who hosted yesterday’s breakfast briefing along with the CBI lobby group, said the mood at the event was ‘very good’ and ‘very uplifting’. But he warned that next year’s general election was creating anxiety.

‘Businesses abhor uncertainty,’ he said. ‘Elections by definition cause uncertainty.’

Mr Collins, whose clients include a raft of blue-chip firms, said the Chancellor presented a confident pro-business message yesterday.

‘He, like all of us, feels that business has to get on the front foot and explain why it is an important part of society, not a drain on it,’ he said. ‘Business creates the GDP, it creates the wealth, it creates the jobs.’

Sir Roger Carr, former president of the CBI who becomes chairman of BAE Systems next month and was also at the breakfast, said: ‘The message we all received is that it is critically important to talk about the contribution big business makes to the wealth and health of the UK economy.’

Another who was present said: ‘It is not the time to be reticent. Business needs to speak out and point out that if we have an anti-business agenda it will cost jobs and damage growth.’

Business leaders gathering in Davos for the World Economic Forum are uneasy about the prospect of a Labour government

One London-based businessman said he was ‘taken aback’ by the ill-feeling towards Mr Miliband among British business leaders. ‘In private they are far more vocal about how bad it could be than I expected,’ he said. ‘People are worried.’

A chief executive of a FTSE 100 firm echoed the sentiment. ‘It is concerning,’ he said. ‘If they win and come out anti-business and anti-markets, of course it will have a detrimental effect on the economy.’

John Nelson, chairman of insurance giant Lloyd’s of London, said it was crucial that the Government continued to cut the deficit and back business. ‘If this recovery is going to be sustained we need to have the opposite of business-bashing,’ he added. ‘I don’t understand people saying business is a bad thing. This recovery is being driven by business.’

In another blow to the Labour leader, Sir John Armitt – who advises Labour on infrastructure policy – said Mr Miliband’s pledge to freeze energy bills could give investors the jitters and have a knock-on effect on investment in the energy market. He told The House magazine that when governments intervene in markets ‘economies do a darn sight worse’.

The International Monetary Fund this week raised its growth forecasts for the UK by more than any other major economy and expects gross domestic product to increase by 2.4 per cent this year.

The Office for National Statistics is next week expected to report that the economy grew by nearly 2 per cent last year – the best performance since 2007.

But Lord Adair Turner, former chairman of the Financial Services Authority, warned that Britain has lurched back to its bad old ways of pumping up the economy through the housing market and debt-fuelled spending rather than exports and investment.
