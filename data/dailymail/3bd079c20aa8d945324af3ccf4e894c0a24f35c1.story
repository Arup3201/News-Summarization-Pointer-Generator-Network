When you are aiming to become the President of the United States, the last thing you wish to see is your campaign crash into the ground.

Sadly for Mitt Romney, this is precisely what happened on Sunday night, when a blimp carrying his campaign message fell from the skies over Florida in Sunday night.

Luckily nobody was injured in the crash, which was caused by high winds, but is did cause some amusement in a town which generally supports the Democrats.

Witness Rosemary Dondiego, an Obama supporter, said: 'Yeah, I brought it down with a rock...no.'

Meanwhile neighbour Teri Balter said: 'We saw the blimp hovering over the house and it was floating backwards - 
it looked like it was coming down.

'I 
thought boy, Mitt Romney really wants us to vote for him.'

The blimp contained the slogan 'America Needs Romney', and it was flying from Boca Rato - the site of today's third and final debate between Obama and Romney - to North Perry Airport.

But five miles from the airport, the blimp came down in the town of Davie, Broward County.

NBC Miami quoted Davie Police spokesman Capt. Dale Engle, who said: 'It experienced some high winds and was having a difficult time and 
crash landed here in the field just south of Bamford Park in Davie.

'They were experiencing some problems due to the wind which 
forced them to crash land here in the field.

'It came down tail first and then the gondola struck and then rolled to its side as it deflated.'

He added that the pilot was able to put it down in a field and avoid the nearby houses.

The deflated airship has now been transported to its intended destination at North Perry Airport.

Romney's face is not the only one plummeting to the ground this week.

Obama leads by a wafer-thin 0.2 per cent nationally in the RealClearPolitics poll of averages.

Tonight is his last chance halt Mitt 
Romneyâ€™s late surge and stave off a re-election defeat after plummeting 
in the polls after his disastrous first debate performance.

Obama
is down seven in the Gallup tracking poll, down two in the Rasmussen 
poll and has seen his leads in Florida and Virginia disappear - and his 
Ohio advantage whittled down to almost nothing.

The latest NBC/WSJ poll, which had 
Obama three points ahead before the debates, now puts the two candidates
dead level on 47 points each among likely voters with six per cent 
undecided.

Although most 
pundits and post-debate polls have Obama the advantage over Romney 
following the second debate, he has seen no improvement in the polls and
the momentum appears to remain with the Republican nominee.

The
final presidential debate will focus on foreign policy - a traditional 
Republican strength that should be an advantage for Obama this time 
around because of the demise of Osama bin laden last May and the end of 
the Iraq war.
