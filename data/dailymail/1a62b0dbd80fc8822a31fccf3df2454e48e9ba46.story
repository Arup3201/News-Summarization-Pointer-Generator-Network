Danger: Fair skinned Marianne was diagnosed with skin cancer as a teen

This glorious weather has reminded me of the summers of my childhood and endless days on the beach, building sandcastles, splashing in the sea and eating egg and cress sandwiches.

Miraculously, given that most of my holidays were spent on the west coast of Ireland, I recall lots of sunshine; new freckles that looked as if they were made by a brown felt tip pen and going home pink with sunburn and happiness.

They were a time of innocence in more ways than one. Looking back at the pictures of 18 years of childhood beach holidays, it is hard to compute that such idyllic days could one day be blamed for causing a serious risk to my health.

I was 18 when I discovered a large, raised, scabby mole on the inside of my left leg. Still blissfully ignorant of its implications, I spent months paying it scant attention, before finally mentioning it to my GP in the August of 1996. 

'How long has it been like this?' he asked, not quite looking me in the eye.

I shrugged. 'A few months maybe.'

'Has it got bigger? Has it been bleeding? Has it changed shape?' he asked.

I told him it had grown, and that after knocking it with a towel the week before, it was bleeding, which was why I'd finally got around to getting it checked out.

'Why didn’t you come sooner?' he asked.

'I didn’t think it was serious,' I said. I was wrong. 

Ten days later, I found myself being told by a consultant that I had malignant melanoma, the most deadly form of skin cancer. I remember staring out of the window, stunned, as a man mowed the patch of grass in the middle of the car park and the words 'cancer' and 'chemo' hung in the air.

Although the doctors could not say for certain whether the sun caused it, they said there was a strong link, especially with my pale skin and red hair. And they explained the exposure during early childhood was the most damaging. 

Days in the sun: Marianne as a little girl wears a T-shirt to protect her shoulders but it was on her legs that she developed a cancerous mole

My mother squeezed my hand and I bit my lip to stop myself crying. We were both in shock. Our excuse was that this was almost 20 years ago, before the endless sun-safety awareness campaigns began, and the aisles of SPF creams were fully stocked up with factor 50.

But now we're so well-informed about skin cancer's deadly link to the sun that, last week, experts suggested parents who still let their children get badly burnt should be referred to social services for neglect.

Is this the nanny state gone mad, as some critics have claimed?

Not in my opinion. I only wish we'd known as much when I was young. We might have been more careful on all those summers on the beach in Ireland, as well as on our more adventurous trips to Portugal and France.

Although Mum tried to cover us up with T-shirts and apply sun cream to stop us from burning, it was only to avoid the pain - she had no idea of the lasting consequences - and her attempts were not always successful. 

I remember nights spent lying in cool baths to take out the heat of the burn and trying not to scratch my sore, taut skin. Afterwards, my arms and shoulders often peeled.

Oblivious: Marianne didn't consider the long term risks when she sunbathed as a 12-year-old

Living with the scars: Marianne had to have a chunk of her calf cut out to remove the cancer

It seems insane now, to think that we had no idea this was the making of a timebomb.

Fortunately for me, after surgery to remove a tennis-ball size chunk out of my left calf, doctors were confident they'd removed all the cancer. I didn't need chemo. After five years of regular check-ups, I was given the all clear.

'The agony these children can suffer is 
horrendous. With all the advice out there children should not be getting
 burned. It's neglect'

I was left with a huge scar on my leg, and a small chunk of it is still missing, but I was lucky. I learned my lesson and now spend summer days in the shade, in a long dress and a wide-brimmed hat.

I bore anyone who will listen about the dangers of the sun and am grateful that we all know so much more now than we used to.

Or do we? During the current heatwave I’ve been depressed to realise that despite non-stop education about the dangers, some people are still stupid when it comes to the sun, even when it involves protecting their children.

The other morning I woke up to pictures of Wayne and Coleen Rooney on holiday in Portugal. They were sitting on a beach in the blazing sun, with two-month-old son Klay on their laps. Yes, he was wearing a little hat, T-shirt and shorts, and may have had sun cream on, but I winced to see his pale pink legs, arms and face exposed in that kind of heat. 

Lesson learnt: Marianne will no longer stay out in the sun like she did as a child

Last week, hospitals reported seeing cases of severe sunburn among children, including babies as young as four weeks old. 

No wonder campaigners are now calling for social services to step in to look after children's vulnerable skin, if their parents won't.

Pat Wade, founder of charity Burned Children’s Club, says: 'The agony these children can suffer is horrendous. With all the advice out there children should not be getting burned. It's neglect.

'In effect, you're abusing that child because you’re not looking after it properly.'

I couldn't agree more. With all we know about cancer these days, letting your child get blistering burns is at least child neglect and, at worst, child abuse.

Every year, more than 100,000 people in the UK are diagnosed with skin cancer and 2,500 people die from it. The British Skin Foundation warns that by the end of this blazing summer, around 1,250 people in the UK will contract the disease. And it's young people who are most at risk.

Cases of malignant melanoma rose more than any other type of cancer in the past decade, to make it the most common cancer in young adults aged 15 to 34. Just one case of bad sunburn as a child or in adolescence more than doubles your chance of developing melanoma later in life.

In fact, experts say letting your child stay unprotected in the sun is more dangerous than letting them smoke a cigarette  - just ten minutes can be all it takes for the sun's UVB rays to burn their delicate skin. 

Be responsible: Sun cream should be applied every two hours

So why are parents still being so irresponsible?

Of course, the vast majority of parents do all they can to protect their children. I was recently on a beach in France (wearing SPF 50 under an umbrella) where I saw children wearing those brilliant all-in-one UVA suits, running around looking like little super heroes.

Most parents were regularly spraying on cream, but probably not enough of it - though I appreciate it can be quite an undertaking to apply it to wriggly, excitable kids who keep dashing in and out of the sea and won't keep their hats on.

According to research, more than half of Britons don’t reapply sun cream every two hours, as experts advise, and 60 per cent say it's because the cream is too expensive.

While there's no denying that keeping a family of four covered in factor 50 is not cheap, it is a lot less expensive than it used to be.

'I know I risk sounding miserable when I 
warn people to avoid the sun now that it's finally here -  but I just want to urge 
caution'

Asda has brought out a range of creams that go up to SPF 50 and start at £3.50. They are also campaigning with the British Skin Foundation to make the government drop VAT on sunscreens, which is deemed a 'luxury item' rather than a health essential.

And if you really can't afford endless bottles of sun cream, try a T-shirt and light trousers on your kids, or keep them in the shade between 11am and 4pm. As the saying goes, it's only mad dogs and Englishmen who go out in the midday sun. Isn't it time that stopped?

Of course, I know I risk sounding miserable when I warn people to avoid the sun now that it's finally here - we all need the vitamin D and pure joy that it brings - but I just want to urge caution.

This summer in France I got more relaxed. The sky was cloudy and there was a cool breeze so I didn't put my hat on, and I didn't reapply my cream. Before I knew it we'd been out all afternoon and my face and arms were decidedly pink. I was so angry with myself. 

Even I have to remind myself of the dangers and when I do, I think about a lady I interviewed a couple of years ago, whose daughter had the same kind of skin cancer as me, also on her leg.

She was diagnosed with a malignant melanoma when she was 13 and was dead at 17.

Something to think about next time you’re on the beach with your children, telling yourself the sun isn't really that strong.

It is. Sometimes fatally so.
