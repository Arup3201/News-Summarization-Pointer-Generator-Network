Bread and water: Inmates in Maricopa County (AZ) are down to bare bones rations after desecrating American flags in their jail cells

Controversial Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio has found a new object of scorn – misbehaving convicts.

The normally immigration-focused Maricopa County top cop has put several dozen inmates on a twice-a-day bread and water diet after they vandalized American flags hanging in their cells.

The bare-bones rations have been meted out to 36 inmates across six jails in the metropolitan Phoenix county, Arpaio announced in a statement.

‘These inmates have destroyed the American flag that was placed in their cells. Tearing them, writing on them, stepping on them, throwing them in the toilet, trash or wherever they feel,’ he said.

‘It's a disgrace to those who have fought for our country,’ he continued. ‘This is government property that they are destroying, and we will take action against those who act this way.”

The punishment will last a total of seven days until January 30, according to Reuters. A second offense will result in a 10 day reprimand.

Maricopa County jails have also recently begun blasting patriotic songs over the public address system and put inmate-veterans together so ‘they could get the help associated with their needs,’ said the statement.

Dan Pachoda, of the American Civil Liberties Union, said the move is a publicity stunt, but not against the law.

‘It's certainly not illegal, but what he is doing is bad policy,’ Pochoda said. ‘It's just another vindictive policy that has nothing to do with running a good jail system.’

Arpaio is facing a lawsuit from the U.S. Justice Department accusing him of civil rights abuses, over allegations he and his officers profile Latinos.

The Arizona immigration law that was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court allows police in the state to ask people they stop about their immigration status.
