Claims: Kevan Thakrar is attempting to sue the Prison Service

A triple killer who complained about being subjected to 'excessive searches' in jail is attempting to sue the Prison Service over alleged infringements of his human rights.

Kevan Thakrar, who is currently serving three life-sentences, is taking legal action over, what he claims are, illegal practices in prisons.

Thakrar wants to bring a case against the Prison Service using the European Convention on Human Rights.

The 24-year-old claims his rights are being breached involving his privileged correspondence with lawyers, his private use of telephones and prison visits with his legal team.

Ms Flo Krause, who represents the complainant Thakrar, told the Civil Courts of Justice in Manchester that her client has also complained about 'excessive searches' while in jail.

Thakrar, from Stevenage, Hertfordshire, must serve a minimum of 35 years before parole can be considered and is currently held at HMP Woodhill, a category A jail, in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire.

He was jailed along with his brother Miran in 2007 for the gangland-style execution of three drug dealers.

Keith Cowell, 52, his son Matthew, 17, and Tony Dulieu, 33, from Essex, were killed at the Cowells’ house in Bishop’s Stortford, Hertfordshire.

The Thakrars were also found guilty of the attempted murders of Christine Jennings, 54, and Matthew Cowell’s girlfriend, Clare Evans, 23, at the house.

The men had met at the house to do a cocaine deal, but Miran Thakrar, a small-time drug dealer, was angry he had been sold poor quality cocaine previously by the Cowells and was out for revenge.

Miran Thakrar shot the family dog and then lined up Keith Cowell, Matthew Cowell and Mr Dulieu, and shot them dead as his brother Kevan looked on.

The brothers also shot and stabbed Christine Jennings and attacked Clare Evans with a knife as she tried to shield her three-year-old daughter.

The case was described by trial judge Mr Justice Cooke as a 'cold-blooded multiple murder carried out in a savage way'.

At today’s preliminary hearing in Manchester before Judge Waksman QC, sitting as a judge of the High Court, the court heard the brief grounds of Thakrar’s claim is that either national or local prison polices are unlawful and infringe his human rights involving his legal letters, use of telephones and visits.

It is understood Thakrar will claim that under the European Convention on Human Rights, while in prison his rights under Article 6, rights to a fair trial, and Article 8, right to respect for one’s private and family life, are both being broken.

Jonathan Auburn was present at the hearing as lawyer for the Secretary Of State For Justice, who will defend the prison authorities when the case comes to trial later this year.

If Thakrar wins his case, he will be able to sue the authorities for damages.

Last November at Newcastle Crown Court Thakrar was cleared of two counts of attempted murder and three counts of wounding with intent after an incident at Frankland Prison in County Durham.

He admitted lashing out with a broken bottle and injuring three prison guards but the jury agreed he acted in self-defence in a 'pre-emptive strike' after suffering years of alleged racist bullying.

A two-day trial to hear Thakrar’s human rights case has been set for October 11.
