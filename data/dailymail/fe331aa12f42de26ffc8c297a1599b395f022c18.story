A three-year-old girl who lost her right eye and was left with horrific scarring after being mauled by her grandfather’s pitbulls is on the road to recovery thanks to the generosity of three doctors who are working hard to rebuild her face.

Victoria Wilcher from Mississippi made national headlines in June after her grandmother claimed they'd been kicked out of KFC because the young girl’s disfigured face had scared customers.

The allegations were later disproved, but little Victoria’s tragic story attracted widespread sympathy including from three doctors who have volunteered their time and expertise to help the young girl.

A Florida doctor has made Victoria a prosthetic eye, while a local physician has reconstructed the girl’s eyelid and a Las Vegas plastic surgeon has agreed to carry out a series of operations over the next five years.

‘We are extremely optimistic about Victoria's recovery,’ plastic surgeon Dr. Frank Stile told Fox News. ‘We continue to track her progress as her facial bones and scars continue to heal.’

Last month Dr. Raymond Peters, of Naples, Florida, made and installed Victoria’s prosthetic eye.

Doctors then noticed the girl’s lower eyelid needed to be corrected in order to support the new eye and so Dr. Kyle Lewis, of Jackson, carried out a skin graft.

The toddler will need an estimated 200 surgeries to repair her damaged face.

‘Victoria is going to have to go through at least four to five years of surgery,’ said Peters.

One operation in the near future will make the lid over Victoria’s good eye match the one on which Lewis operated in order to 'produce more symmetry of her facial structure,’ said Stile.

Victoria gained national attention in June when her grandmother, Kelly Mullins, said they were forced to leave KFC because the girl’s scarred face was 'disrupting our customers'.

Although two different investigations disproved the claims, the fast food chain offered to donate $30,000 to the Wilcher family.

Despite sticking to their story, the Wilchers asked KFC to give the money to the foundation of Dr. Stile.

More than $100,000 was also donated via GoFundMe.com, but even after the KFC story was exposed only a few donors requested their money returned.

The family has pledged that every cent will be spend on getting Victoria better. It has been put in a discretionary trust account which is due to have a third-party, non-family member designated as the trustee. 

Some of the money will be used to pay Victoria's travel and hospital expenses during her regular trips to Las Vegas for surgeries.

Janet Kellum, who is the stepmother of the Wilchers’ family attorney, Bill Kellum, and who has taken on the role of family spokesperson, told Fox News Victoria 'is doing really well.'

'She’s back being active, playful,' Kellum said. 'Back to her little, same-old 3-year-old self.' 

Victoria had been injured in April when three of her grandfather's pit bull dogs ran into his home in Simpson County by ripping through the back door of the home before jumping on her.

They dragged the little girl outside into the backyard, where they continued to maul her before her grandfather, Donald Mullins, and his girlfriend, Rita Tompkins, attempted to stop the carnage.

The dogs then attacked their owners, causing Mullins to shoot them. Two of the dogs were killed.

Victoria was rushed to the emergency room. She suffered a shattered top and bottom jaw, broken cheekbones and eye-sockets, a broken nose, lost her right eye, and lost the ability to move the right side of her face.

Mullins and Tompkins were arrested on charges of child endangerment and their eight surviving pit bulls were seized by Animal Control officers.

They have been charged with child endangerment and the case is expected to go before a grand jury soon.
