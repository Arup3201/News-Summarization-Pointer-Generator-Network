still easily accessible.

Mr Hopkins added: ‘The quality and 
size of the rooms are not something you would expect, it is 
extraordinary - a bit like a tardis.

‘The gardens are amazing and it is rare for a Cotswolds house to have a river flowing through it.

‘Overall
 it is a unique estate which offers somebody the opportunity to put 
their own stamp on it. The estate is now for sale after its owner, a 
private American gentleman, passed away.

‘The
 family have now decided to sell it. It would suit someone who wanted to
 entertain but also someone who was looking for privacy.’
