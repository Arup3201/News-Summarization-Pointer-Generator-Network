A Georgia man couldn't believe his luck when he was reunited with a ring he lost more than 40 years ago - all thanks to Facebook.

Richard Hale dropped his class ring out of a car window in 1972 and had long ago resigned himself to never seeing it again.

He was driving near Georgia Tech and it flew off his finger as he threw something out of the window. He was heartbroken at the loss as his parents had bought it for him despite financial pressures.

Lost and found: A man who lost his class ring more than 40 years ago was amazed when it was returned by a woman on Facebook

Richard Hale, from Georgia, lost his beloved class ring out of his car window as a young man and never thought he'd see it again

He told MyFoxAtlanta: 'We were riding around with friends and for some reason, I tossed something out the window, and when I did, I thought, 'Oh no my ring is gone.'

However, Hale got the surprise of a lifetime when his brother called him to let him know he had seen the ring on Facebook.

Mr Hale added: 'I got a call from my brother who lives in Tennessee; he's a big Facebook fan.

'He said: "Somebody's found the ring".'

Betty Anne Hale, Richard's wife, was just as surprised as her husband at the ring's safe return

The finder was Ellen Ramey, who said she always hoped she could reunite the ring with its owner after finding it all those years ago.

'My mother had a class ring,'she said

'I wore it to school and lost it and it just stayed in my mind that it was important that these people get their ring back.'

The two connected via Facebook, and Ramey returned the ring to a delighted Hale. 'My mother and daddy sacrificed to pay for it,' Hale said.
