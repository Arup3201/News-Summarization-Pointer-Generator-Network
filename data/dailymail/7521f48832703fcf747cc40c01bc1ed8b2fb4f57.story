David Beckham will go undercover in a 'James Bond-style' advert during Sky Sports' first break of the 2014 World Cup at 9.14 on June 12.

The advert, during Brazil's opening match with Mexico in Sao Paulo, sees Beckham vetting various sporting inventions in a secret laboratory. 

Amongst the quirky technologies Beckham tests but ultimately goes on to reject are remote-controlled drone-cameras swarming over a cricket pitch.

Others include a sensation suit which lets viewers experience the same physical impacts as a professional rugby player, and ‘Sofa Ref’ – X-Factor style voting for refereeing decisions – but everything proposed has a fatal flaw which ultimately results in a thumbs-down from Beckham. 

Beckham then unveils his final idea - Sky Sports 5. 

Sky Sports have announced a new channel dedicated to European football including the Champions League, La Liga and European Championship qualifiers.

Sky Sports 5, which will go alongside Sky's six existing sports channels, will also offer exclusive coverage of the Dutch Eredivisie for the first time.

In November, BT Sport announced an exclusive £897million three-year deal to broadcast live Champions League and Europa League matches from 2015, which was seen a huge blow to Sky.

But Barney Francis, managing director of Sky Sports, insists the new channel takes their existing coverage to a new level.

He said: 'Sky Sports 5 takes our unrivalled live football coverage to the next level offering more European football than ever before.  There’s never been a better time to be a Sky Sports customer and with two years’ free totally unlimited broadband, we offer the ultimate package for sports fans.'

On the continent: La Liga, Champions League and European Championship qualifiers will also be shown

Sky ambassador David Beckham added: 'Some of my greatest playing moments were on the European stage with Manchester United, playing in El Clasico for Real Madrid and captaining England in Euro qualifiers. 

Sky Sports 5 will offer all the drama and excitement that European football has to offer and I’ll certainly be gripped.'

Sky customers can activate Sky Sports 5 on June 12, but the channel does not go live until August 12.
