Mystery: This old photograph of an unknown military man was tucked into the collar of a stray pit bull found in North Carolina

Animal rescuers have been left baffled after finding a stray dog wandering the streets of South Carolina with a black and white photograph of a soldier tucked into its collar.

Staff at Greenville County Animal Care found the tan pit bull, thought to be around two-years-old, had no microchip or other identification when it was brought to the centre earlier this month.

However when they checked his collar, they discovered an old picture of a man wearing military uniform sitting on a railing.

Susan Bufano from the shelter, said there are no further clues as to who the man is or why the photograph was placed into the collar of the dog, which staff have named 'Soldier'.

She said: 'It's so bizarre. Anything is possible.'

Explaining that the collar had an unusual design, Bufano told ABC news:

'It’s a really wide collar, canvas, and 
it’s got an opening. I can’t imagine this photo 
made it in there on accident.'

In a bid to find clues, Animal Care posed the old photograph and a picture of the dog on their Facebook page.

Some have speculated that Soldier, who Belfano described as being 'really friendly with people and just a really nice dog', may belong to a homeless veteran.

Other comments on the Facebook page suggest the man may be holding a knife in his right hand, while others have speculated it is a shadow or wrinkle on his uniform.

Despite the media attention the story has so far attracted, Greenville County Animal Care is yet to find out more about the puppy's mysterious past.

The shelter hopes that the young dog, who is in a healthy condition, can be reunited or find a new home soon.
