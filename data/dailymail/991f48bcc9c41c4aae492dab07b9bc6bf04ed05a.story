A seriously-ill father who needs a double organ transplant to keep him alive is facing a second battle to stop his wife and daughter being forced to return to Australia.

Forklift driver Peter Mark, from Widnes, Cheshire, was diagnosed with a rare disease in September last year and has since faced an excruciating wait for a kidney and liver transplant.

At the time, the 32-year-old was living in Australia with 22-year-old Shauna, but he soon had to leave his wife and their baby daughter  to return to the UK for urgent dialysis treatment.

Peter Mark, from Widnes, Cheshire, is in desperate need of a double organ transplant but is also facing a battle to stop his wife Shaun and ten-month-old daughter Lylah being sent back to Australia 

The 32-year-old spent six months away from his daughter after having to leave Australia to be treated at the Royal Liverpool Hospital for a rare condition, primary hyperoxaluria type one

Now, after six months apart, Mrs Mark and the ten-month-old Lylah have flown to the UK, where they have been reunited with Mr Mark.

But, in just five months, Mrs Mark will be forced to return to Australia because she does not have the correct visa to stay in the UK permanently - unless they can prove they have enough money to support themselves.

Speaking about the ordeal, Mr Mark said: 'The time we spent apart were the hardest six months of my life.

'Shauna is keeping me positive all the time. We're heading for an immigration aid group to see if they can help.' 

Mr Mark met his wife while he was helping victims of the floods in Bundaberg during a trip to Australia.

At the time, he had a visa as a skilled worker. After meeting the soon-to-be Mrs Mark, he planned on starting a new life in Australia. 

The pair married in December 2013 but their honeymoon was short-lived, as Mr Mark had to return to the UK

The young family are now in the UK together but Mrs Mark only has a holiday visa to be here until March

But he was diagnosed with primary hyperoxaluria type one - a rare condition affecting just one person per 1million  - months later.

Mr Mark had surgery, but medics told him he would need dialysis until he has a double transplant. 

His sickness meant he could no longer have a sponsored Australian visa and Mr Mark had to fly home in April, leaving his beloved family behind. 

At the time, Lylah - who was born in March - was just six weeks old.  

He has since been receiving dialysis at the Royal Liverpool Hospital for eight hours, three evenings a week.  

Mr Mark was in hospital being treated while his 22-year-old wife was pregnant (left). She gave birth to Lylah in March this year (right) 

Meanwhile, Mrs Mark sold her belongings and flew to Britain to be with her husband. 

But Mrs Mark is only in the UK on a holiday visa, which says she must return to Australia in March 2015.

Because Mr Mark lives in the UK permanently, Mrs Mark could to apply to obtain a ‘family of a settled person’ visa.

But part of that application involves proving Mr and Mrs Mark have enough money to adequately support and accommodate themselves and Lylah without relying on public funds.

Primary hyperoxaluria type 1 - known as PH1 - leads to end stage renal failure.

It is caused by the shortage  of an enzyme (alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase) that normally prevents the buildup of oxalate - a chemical found in plant foods. 

Without the enzyme, oxalate builds up leading to kidney stones.

These stones can cause urinary obstruction, urine infection and eventually kidney damage and other organ failure.

Oxalate stones in PH tend to be severe, resulting in relatively early kidney damage which impairs the excretion of oxalate.

This leads to a further acceleration in accumulation of oxalate in the body.

Dialysis can control renal failure but tends to be inadequate to dispose of excess oxalate.

Renal (kidney) transplant is the primary treatment of severe hyperoxaluria.

Liver transplantation is also used to control the disease by correcting the metabolic defect.

Primary hyperoxaluria is estimated to occur in 1 per million people. 

Government rules state that if the UK resident is on disability allowance, the spouse does not have to prove they cannot support themselves.

But Mr Mark cannot obtain sickness benefit as he must be back in the UK for 52 weeks before he can claim.

Guidelines say a spouse who is applying for a five-year visa must show they have £22,400 per year for themselves and one child.

As Mr Mark is unable to work, and Mrs Mark is only on a holiday visa, the pair do not have an income.

The couple - who are currently  staying with Mr Mark's parents, Lesley and Brian - now face a race against time to try and keep their family together.

Mr Mark said: 'My mum and dad have been brilliant. I couldn't ask for better parents.

'My little girl and my wife are keeping me going.'  

Mrs Mark's sister, Tara Auer, has now launched a fundraising appeal for her brother-in-law.

She wants to raise enough money so the family can live together in the UK.

They also hope enough money is raised so Mr Mark can have his treatment privately.

Mrs Auer said: 'All this family want is to be together, happy and healthy.

'Peter has no job and no money. All he wants is to work and provide for his family but his body will not let him.

'I am campaigning to raise awareness and funds for Peter.'

Mr Mark said: We can't thank our family and friends enough for all their help and support. Everyone has been brilliant.'

MailOnline has contacted the Home Office for comment. 

Some people really get dealt with a heartbreaking story. My sister Shauna and her beautiful family Peter and Lylah have had far more than their fair share of bad luck.

Peter has a rare disease causing kidney and liver failure - needing a transplant urgently.

He was going through all the right channels to get sponsorship in Australia as a skilled worker when his continued worsened making him unable to work and was let go by the sponsoring employer.

Being a liability to Australia and urgently needing a transplant his citizenship of Australia was rejected... he had to scrap together to get a ticket back to the UK, after a long and stressful trip home ensuring he was able to survive the flight without dialysis - leaving his wife and 2 month old baby here in Australia he returned to the UK.

Peter spend 6 months away from his love Shauna and his baby girl Lylah. Peter missed 6 months of his daughters life - first tooth, standing up, her smiles and all of the other beautiful moments that can't be replaced.

The only contact they had was skype. Six months later my sister Shauna was able to save enough with help from generous friends and family to go to the UK for a while to visit her husband and reunite the family.

The trip wasn't ideal with an 8 month old baby to a foreign country, to top off the situation she was interrogated in customs and was almost declined entry into the country, as they assumed she wasn't going to return to Australia.

Along with this Peter was again struck down and was in the emergency ward.

Now 6 weeks in and life has been steady for this family - together everyday and enjoying the small things in life.

Peter still waiting to be put onto the transplant list, his condition has worsened. Making him unable to attend work as much as he would like and to provide for his family.

Today Peter was again let go as he wasn't able to attend as require due to emergency hospital making him unable to work.

Peter requires a minimum 3 x 5 hours of dialysis per week - 3 days a week and after dialysis he is drained and ill.

Unfortunate lately he has required to spend so many nights in hospital to be able to survive. With Peter not being able to work and Shauna having just a visiting visa (non-working) as she was declined citizenship or a working visa due to having a baby they have no source of income and are literally unable to live.

Unfortunately they don't have enough money to even pay board or food or even travel expenses getting to and from hospital.

Their families have done everything they can do for them and will continue to support them as much as possible within their means but unfortunately that doesn't go far.

Please share and spread this post as much as possible. All I want is for my sister and her family to be happy and healthy.

I hope that this becomes a post that reaches so many people that care and people that want a young beautiful family to be together.

The future for this family is very uncertain and all they want to do is be together. Please, if you aren't able to help please share this story... Thank you xx
