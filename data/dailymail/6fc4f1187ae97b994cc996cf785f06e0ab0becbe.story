Anna Wintour is well known for her frosty exterior, so it should come as no surprise that she has openly admitted she can't stand being hugged.

The steely Vogue editor and chairman of the annual Met Gala joined Sarah Jessica Parker on Late Night with Seth Meyers to discuss the trials and tribulations of co-hosting fashion's biggest night of the year.

'The worst is the people who you've never met before if your life before, that want to hug you in a major embrace,' Ms Wintour, 64, remarked, demonstrating a bear hug of her own. 'You just have to step back and say "How do you do?"'

In the lively ten minute interview, the power duo boasted that they had raised a record-breaking $12 million for the Metropolitan Museum of Art and cracked jokes with Seth Meyers in a rare - in Ms Wintour's case - show of playfulness.

Ms Jessica Parker, former star of Sex and the City, commenced by revealing that her role at the Gala was far from easy.

'[I was required to be] somewhat presentable... not embarrass the institution,' she said, gesturing overtly at Ms Wintour, before adding that she was 'reprimanded very early on' by the fierce editor.

'She talks
 too much!' exclaimed Ms Wintour, quickly cutting in and explaining that
 guests arriving at the event were quick to 'rush away' from her after a
 brief handshake, but stuck around to chat with the 'polite' Ms Jessica
 Parker.

The actress, who looked ravishing in a yellow floral dress and turquoise cardigan, marveled at Ms Wintour's ability to keep greetings brief.

'She offers a hospitable hand, and without any words is able to communicate that that's all that will happen,' she relayed, adding that the dramatic white gloves she wore for the evening were filthy in the 'sober light' of morning, from all the handshakes she too had exchanged.

Ms Wintour
 went on to compare a few of her previous co-hosts, including Oprah 
Winfrey, whom guests actually 'curtsied' for, and Hollywood hunk George 
Clooney.

'The
 women just would not leave his side,' she recalled, also revealing that
 he had the 'best' introduction line for greeting people at the event.

'Hello,
 I'm George Clooney, and I'm running for congress. Do I have your vote?'
 he allegedly said to arriving guests - which was met with a rapturous applause from the audience.

Another highlight was Ms Wintour's revelation that Ms Jessica Parker was so 'exhausted' during the lavish event that she 'just collapsed on the floor.'

'It was the chicest collapse I'd ever seen!' she joked.

The pair also discussed Ms Wintour's choice of dress code this year, which was 'white tie and diamonds' - a theme she picked to 'turn the tables' and make it harder for men who usually only have to have to come in a black tux.

'I had no idea how much panic it would create!' she admits, adding that designer Tom Ford received 'hundreds' of emails from men trying to clarify what they should wear.

They then proceeded to judge a few of the male guests' outfits.

Tom Brady was attacked for not embracing the theme 'at all', although Ms Wintour interjected: 'Well he has Gisele, so that helps.'

Hugh Jackson was mocked for his 'white tropical' dinner jacket, Mr Meyers was scolded for not having 'tails', Kanye West was declared 'almost perfect' and Bradley Cooper stole the show in the discerning eyes of Ms Wintour.

'My punk days are behind me'

Mr Meyers pointed out that last year's theme, as chosen by the woman herself, was punk and that Ms Wintour had completely ignored it, opting for a floral dress instead. Her response was quick and elegantly delivered.

'Seth, my punk days are behind me.'
