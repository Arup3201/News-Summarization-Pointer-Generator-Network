A  man accused of strangling his wife was high on cocaine and hallucinating when he called 911 to report she was being attacked by intruders, a court heard.

Lawyers defending David Brevick, 52, said he was seeing things when he made the call, while his wife was thrashing around on the floor in a cocaine-induced seizure.

Prosecutors allege that Brevick made up the whole episode to cover up the fact he killed his 56-year-old wife Francia Vargas-Brevick at their home in Florida.

The jury was played a tape  of  Brevick, of Brevard County, screaming down the phone at 911 operators, WESH.com reported.

'They're crazy!' he shouts. 'They won't stop!'

The operator then asks: 'How many people are there?' Brevick's voice responds: 'I don't know. At least two. At least two. Don't do this!'

Lawyers defending Brevick said he was seeing things when he made the call last August

Brevard County Sheriff's Deputies found Mrs Vargas-Brevick naked, injured and unresponsive when they arrived at the property last August.

She was rushed to Health First Holmes Regional Medical Center in critical condition but died at the hospital two days later.

Brevick answered the door completely naked, and he appeared confused and was sweating profusely, Florida Today reported.

He said there were people inside the home 'choking out' his wife, and tried to direct the deputies to the side of the property, but they found no intruders.

Brevick has hired three of the most prominent private attorneys in the county for his legal team, WESH.com reports.

Defense attorneys say Brevick had none of his wife's DNA under his fingernails, even though there were nail marks on her neck.

Attorney Greg Eisenmenger said: 'All of those injuries are consistent with her injuring herself in the throes of a grand mal seizure.'
