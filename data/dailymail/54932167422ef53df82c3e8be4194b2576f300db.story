Rusting dog tags worn by the hero pilot Sir Douglas Bader while he languished in a Nazi Prisoner of War Camp are being auctioned for up to £1,800.

The Second World War ace was captured in August 1941 after his plane crashed into another in mid-air over Le Touquet, France.

After successfully escaping his captors - despite having artificial legs - he was eventually sent to Germany's top-security Colditz Castle where he was forced to remain until the war ended.

Now two tags, one issued by the RAF and the other made by the Nazis with the label 'Oflag IV-C', Colditz's codename, will be among 350 Second World War lots auctioned next month.

Sir Douglas, who lost both his legs in a 1931 flying accident, became one of the Second World War's most celebrated pilots for his uncompromising and fearless approach.

Memorabilia of the pilot for sale also includes his RAF car hood ornament and two of his flying caps - which are expected to sell for more than £4,000 each.

Bonhams will hold the auction in New York on June 5, a day before the 70th anniversary of the 'D-Day' Normandy landings.

Sir Douglas' German-issued tag is stamped with his prisoner number 3797, which also appeared on his 'Wanted' poster when he escaped.

It is joined by an octagonal RAF tag, designed to identify him if he died in battle, pressed with his service number of 26151 and suspended from a single waxed cotton cord.

The items were handed by Sir Douglas after he was freed from Colditz to his colleague Arthur Dunn, the Officer's Mess Clerk at RAF Duxford.

Dunn had already been looking after Sir Douglas' uniform and personal items after he was taken prisoner. When the war ended, he took possession of the dog tags.

Sir Douglas lived a long and prosperous life after the war, being promoted to group captain after his release and leading a victory flypast of 300 aircraft over London.

He left the RAF in 1946 for a job with Shell Aircraft and joined the Civil Aviation Authority in 1969.

Four years later he published his celebrated autobiography and he was knighted for his work for other amputees.

The pilot continued flying until ill-health stopped him aged 69, and he died of a heart attack three years later in September 1982.

It is not the first time his dog tags have been sold.

The RAF tags were issued in pairs, and the other one was sold at auction in 1999 along with his wristwatch, tunic and cap for almost £12,000.

The auction features 350 lots, including manuscripts, photographs, wartime technology, authentic weaponry, personal mementos and battlefield souvenirs.

Highlights include a German Army Enigma enciphering machine which could fetch around £50,000.

Also expected to raise around £50,000 is an original print of the iconic photograph of American troops raising the flag at Iwo Jima, which was sent from Associated Press Guam to San Francisco.

Tom Lamb, Bonhams' business development director for the books and manuscripts department in New York, said: 'Every object in the sale has an incredible story to tell.

'They bear witness to the war's unparalleled turmoil, and testify to the bravery of many individuals as well as entire nations.

'Presenting the sale on the eve of the 70th anniversary of D-Day is a way of honouring this momentous day and recognising the tragic losses on all sides.'

A string of high-profile events across Britain will mark the 70th anniversary of the Normandy landings on June 6.

They will include a display by the Red Arrows in Portsmouth followed by a flotilla of ships sailing to France.

A memorial service will also be held at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire.

On June 6, 1944, thousands of allied troops bombed, shelled and landed on the beaches at Normandy marking the beginning of the European invasion and major offensive against the Nazis.

A total of 75,215 British and Canadian troops and 57,500 U.S. troops were landed by sea, with another 23,400 landed by air.

Around 10,000 soldiers and civilians are estimated to have been killed during the bloody fighting, which ultimately opened the gateway to victory for Britain and its allies.

Struggle: The pilot hauling his artificial limbs into the cockpit of a Spitfire to lead a memorial flight

Sir Douglas Robert Steuart Bader CBE was credited with 20 aerial victories, four shared victories and many other probable victories.

He joined the RAF in 1928 and was commissioned in 1930, but in December 1931, he crashed and lost both his legs while attempting an aerobatic display.

The pilot recovered from the brink of death and retook flight training, passed his check flights and then requested reactivation as a pilot.

After the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, he was accepted and returned to the RAF.

He scored his first victories over Dunkirk during the Battle of France in 1940 and then took part in the Battle of Britain.

When his Spitfire crashed in 1941, his artificial limbs may have saved his life. One of his feet was trapped under a pedal and he could only bail out because he could detach the leg.

His lack of extremities also left him less vulnerable to G-forces which caused many pilots to black out when their blood drained away from their heads.

Despite his disability, he made a number of escape attempts from the clutches of the Nazis.

In one, a French farmer and his wife hid Sir Douglas in their barn - and when he was found they were sent to a concentration camp.

Sir Douglas was eventually sent to the 'escape-proof' POW camp at Colditz Castle, where he remained until April 1945 when the camp was liberated.

But his abilities earned him respect among his captors. German General Adolf Galland told the British about the pilot's damaged legs and allowed Winston Churchill to send replacements safely by plane.

The same plane then continued on its way to drop bombs on German targets.

During the 1950s, a book and a film, Reach for the Sky, starring Kenneth More, chronicled Sir Douglas' life and RAF career to the end of the Second World War.
