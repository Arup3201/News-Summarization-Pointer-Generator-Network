For a motorcycle rider, it is the ultimate adrenaline rush - and for anyone else, the most terrifying (and dangerous) motorsport event in the world.

This new video reveals the astonishing risks taken by competitors in the Isle of Man's famous annual TT road race.

It shows a helmet eye view from racer Michael Dunlop as he negoaties the course known as the most dangerous in the world - and which has claimed 240 rider's lives since it began in 1907.

The video reveals the astonishing angles riders see the course as they lay their bikes down to get around corners, scraping their knees as they go.

Between 1907 and 2009 (at the end of 2009 TT races period) there have been 240 rider deaths during official practices or races on the Snaefell Mountain Course.

The worst year for fatalities was 1970 when six riders lost their lives at the TT.

Another racer died at the Manx Grand Prix later in the same year.

The TT races are notorious because riders achieve high speeds on very narrow, twisting streets, roads and lanes flanked by stone walls and buildings, and often come within inches of spectators.

This stunning video was released today as preparations begin for the 2014 event, set to take place between the 24th of May and the 6th of June.

'There is nothing on Earth quite like the Isle of Man TT Races,' organisers say.

'No other motorcycle race is held on such a challenging track as the 37-mile plus Mountain Course with its seemingly never-ending series of bends, bumps, jumps, stone walls, manhole covers and telegraph poles.

The skill, bravery and concentration levels required are immense, with speeds approaching 200mph, and, while difficult to learn and even harder to come first, the rewards for winning on the world famous course are like no other.

The footage shows Dunlop coming within inches of spectators, and passing other riders of the hugely complex course - all while flat out.

We're off! The video begins in the pits as Michael Dunlop's tackles lap 3 of the 2013 Monster Energy Supersport Race 2.

The video was taken in 2013.

'It's lap 3 of the 2013 Monster Energy Supersport Race 2 - Michael Dunlop is holding second place on corrected time to Bruce Anstey but trailing John McGuinness and Cameron Donald on the road,' says the Duke team who uploaded it.

'As he leaves the pits it's clear Michael is on a mission to get himself on to the podium for the fourth time in a week.

'Blasting down Bray Hill on the PTR tuned MD Racing CBR600RR Dunlop's a man on the move.

'With John and Cameron in his sights Michael's in determined move - watch as he dices with these old TT hands and puts a silky move on them at Ramsey Hairpin.'
