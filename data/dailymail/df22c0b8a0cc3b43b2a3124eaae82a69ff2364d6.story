Google is being sued by dozens of customers in Britain who claim it secretly monitored their computers and phones.

More than 100 Apple product users are seeking compensation in a lawsuit over claims the internet giant tampered with security software in order to access their personal information.

Some claimants said they felt as if they were being ‘stalked’ after they were bombarded by phone calls and emails advertising clothes, magazines and bank loans connected to the websites they had visited on their iPhones, iPads and laptops.

Compensation claims: Google is being sued by customers who claim it secretly monitored their computers and phones

Campaigners say up to ten million people may have fallen victim – and believe the lawsuit against the search engine could become one of the biggest in British legal history.

One claimant, Marc Bradshaw, said he checked instructions on Google’s website to stop it collecting data from his iPhone.

‘Then it emerged Google had worked around the privacy setting,’ Mr Bradshaw, an IT expert, said. ‘They tried to argue it was a programming error. But this was not an accident.’

Google has previously offered guarantees it would not collect data from those using the Apple internet browser, Safari.

But the company harvested details of websites users had visited so they could bombard them with ads, it is alleged.

The case is the latest in a string of concerns over the secretive company, which made £2.6billion in the UK in 2012. It emerged that Google had harvested data from millions of homes with its Street View cars, which were photographing virtually every road in Britain. The data included passwords and bank details.

The company has also been condemned as ‘immoral’ for slashing more than £200million from its UK tax bill in 2011 by pushing revenues offshore.

It is thought that the latest problem may have affected anyone using an Apple computer or an iPhone or iPad to surf between September 2011 and February last year, as well as anyone who has downloaded and used the Safari browser in that time.

Privacy campaigner Alex Hanff said the case has ‘the potential to become the largest ever group action seen in the UK’.

A similar case brought against Google in America last year resulted in it being fined £14.5million and reprimanded by the US Federal Trade Commission.

The law firm handling the case, Olswang said it had been ‘inundated’ with requests to join the action. ‘The biggest thing we want is an explanation from Google,’ said partner Dan Tench.

He said the version of Safari launched in 2011 blocked ‘cookies’ – the name for devices that track the use of internet pages.

‘Google had a bit of code put in which subverted that protection. Users had what lawyers call a reasonable expectation of privacy.’

Google makes more than 95 per cent of its money from selling advertising space at the side of its own search results. Companies can pay a premium to have their adverts targeted at those who are more likely to be interested in their products.

Google holds data on people’s past web activity, from which it can infer a vast amount of personal information, including interests and disposable income.

This results in users being bombarded with adverts on the back of previous web activity.

Google refused to comment.
