If you spot a flying snail in your garden this weekend don’t worry, you are not seeing things.

It is not very neighbourly… but a fifth of gardeners admit to throwing snails over the fence next door to get rid of them.

A poll by the Royal Horticultural Society of 1,500 people found that 80 per cent of us will be heading out to the garden this Easter weekend to do jobs such as weeding and mowing the lawn.

Londoners are most likely to get rid of snails over the fence (30 per cent), while Scots are the least likely (only 14 per cent)

Despite such wholesome pursuits, 22 per cent surveyed admitted to disposing of their snails over the garden wall.

Londoners are most likely to get rid of snails in this way, with 30 per cent polled saying they had done so, while Scotland is home to the most polite neighbours. Snail throwing was least common there, with just 14 per cent surveyed admitting to it.

Some 80 per cent of those quizzed said they would be weeding this weekend, 63 per cent said they would be mowing and 44 per cent cutting back last year’s foliage on herbaceous plants.

The survey found men were more likely to be caring for their garden lawns than women, with 70 per cent of men saying they would be mowing, compared with 57 per cent of women.

Other jobs that gardeners will be getting busy with at Easter include pruning shrubs after flowering and sowing seeds indoors.

RHS Head of Advisory, Guy Barter, said: ‘After the challenging cold weather last spring, gardeners are enjoying a great start to the season this year and making the most of the sunshine.

‘In March at the RHS we had record calls to our advisory team and answered over 6,000 gardening questions.’

Many gardeners intend to have more pots and more flowers to decorate their gardens with this year, which was good news for garden centres, he said.

The survey also revealed that most people gardened to create beautiful spaces to relax in, and many would be having barbecues, meals and family gatherings in their gardens this Easter.
