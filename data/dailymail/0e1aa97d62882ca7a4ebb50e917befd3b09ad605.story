What a knock-out: Gia Milinovich, with husband Professor Brian Cox, punched an intruder so hard he ran away

Professor Brian Cox may be renowned for solving problems with his mind. His wife, it seems, prefers to use her fists.

The spouse of the sky-gazing TV  physicist has revealed she fought off a burglar who broke into their house at night – and left him seeing stars.

In a dramatic showdown, Gia Milinovich used skills she learned in boxing self-defence lessons to punch the intruder so hard in the face he ran away.

The 44-year-old American gave him a right hook fearing she was in a ‘life or death’  situation with someone who may have been armed or might rape her.

Police officers who rushed to the scene later congratulated her on her bravery. They caught the man using CCTV cameras and he was later jailed for eight weeks.

Miss Milinovich, who married pop star turned TV scientist Cox in 2003 and has a five-year-old son with him, said her husband was away for the night on May 22 when she heard someone walking about the house.

Describing the frightening encounter in her blog, she said she initially thought the noise was caused by Moki, her 17-year-old son from a previous relationship, coming home late.

She said: ‘At just after five, I heard one of our cats jump down from my little son’s bed in his room right next to mine.

'My son happened to be in bed with me as Brian was away for the night.

‘Less than a minute later I heard footsteps in his room. Shoes on the wooden floor. My teenage son was either sneaking in or trying to sneak someone out that he’d snuck in the night before.

‘He’d never done anything like this before, but I was livid.

‘I got up and went to shout at him. I walked out of my room, turned right, looked into my little son’s room and there was a strange man standing there.’

Miss Milinovich said she has taken boxing lessons for the past three years, which had taught her to approach self-defence with a ‘kill or be killed attitude’. So rather than run away or wait to see if the intruder would attack her, she immediately rushed at him.

'After dishing out a right hook, she added: ‘He made a “well, that really wasn’t very nice at all” sound, pushed past me, ran down the stairs with me chasing after him continuing to shout and out the front door of the house.’

Police tracked the burglar after studying CCTV footage  and later found his fingerprints at the house. He admitted the offence in court and Miss Milinovich  found out on Friday that he had been jailed.

Miss Milinovich said she would ‘probably’ take the same action again but would not recommend other women punch intruders unless they have taken self-defence classes.

She added: ‘Apparently, I was the talk of the police station for a few days after the burglary. The police officer who was dealing with my case said that he had never had another case where someone punched a burglar.

‘All of the officers I spoke to asked, “Are you the one who punched him? Well done!”

‘They said they wished more people were like me and had some kind of self-defence training in order to know how to handle themselves in these unusual situations.’

Earlier this year Cox, 46, was seen training with boxing gloves and pads in a park near the couple’s home in south London. He and Miss Milinovich, who presented Demolition Day on Channel 4, met while he was working on an internet TV channel.

Cox first found fame as the keyboard player of pop group D:Ream, best known for their hit Things Can Only Get Better. After the band split in 1997, he completed a Phd in particle physics and went on to work at the Large Hadron Collider near Geneva and present a series of hit BBC science shows.
