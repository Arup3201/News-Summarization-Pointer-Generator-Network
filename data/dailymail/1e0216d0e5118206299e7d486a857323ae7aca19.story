The man, 39, pictured, who Mail Online is not naming to protect the identity of the children, has been charged with raping his adopted children

An Ohio grand jury has indicted an adoptive father on charges he raped three boys in his care.

Police say the investigation began with an undercover detective, part of a state task force, talking online with the man, who said he would arrange sex with a ten-year-old boy.

The 39-year-old man from Troy, Ohio, was arrested on February 24, and the Miami County grand jury action followed.

Police Captain Chris Anderson said between ten and 15 of the 31 grand jury charges carry potential sentences of up to life in prison for the man.

Police have said the man regularly raped the three boys at his home in a quiet residential neighbourhood of ranch homes in Troy, a small city 90-minute drive west of Columbus.

He had three adopted children and was in the process of adopting a fourth child.

School officials said the man had recently withdrawn the three children from school, saying he would home school them.

The man is being held at the Miami County jail on $800,000 bond, the sheriff’s office said.

Two other men - Jason Zwick, 29, from Beavercreek and Patrick Rieder, 31, from Dayton  - were arrested earlier on rape charges related to what authorities say was the prostitution of a ten-year-old boy by the Troy man.

The FBI has said forensic experts will study laptop computers, files, a video camera and other items seized from the adoptive father’s home to try to learn whether there are any more suspects or victims.

Ohio authorities have said they’re investigating a private adoption agency that helped place the children with the man. If Ohio Department of Job and Family Services investigators find serious procedural violations, the state could take actions including revoking the license of Action Inc.

Several messages left at Action’s office in Dayton haven’t been returned.Ohio and Texas family services officials have been communicating with each other on the children’s adoption from Texas.

Texas officials have said it appeared proper procedures were followed, including background checks on the adoptive father.

Troy police have said they don’t know of any past criminal activity by the man.

The man first was certified as a foster parent in Ohio’s Miami County in 2005. Action Inc. has been certified by Ohio for more than a decade.
