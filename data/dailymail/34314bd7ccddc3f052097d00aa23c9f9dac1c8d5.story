Mick Jagger's fashion designer girlfriend L'Wren Scott left her entire $9million estate to the Rolling Stones rocker before taking her own life last week.

Scott, whose remains were cremated on Tuesday following a small, private funeral service in Los Angeles, left a simple will bequeathing all her jewelery, clothing, furniture, cars and other personal effects to 'Michael Phillip Jagger'.

Jagger and the designer’s estranged family have however come to an agreement to split her ashes between them.

Her brother Randall Bambrough whom Scott had appointed as director of her faltering fashion business in November, has revealed that he plans to take Scott’s ashes to her childhood home in Utah

‘She was cremated and I have some of her ashes,’ he told the Daily News.

‘Some of those ashes, they will be buried near our parents here in Utah. And there will be a ceremony, date to be determined, in Utah for all family members who will have an opportunity to see their friends and others.’

Bambrough said he wasn’t sure what the singer planned to do with his share of his late girlfriend’s remains. ‘They’re with the Jagger family. That’s all I can say,’ he said.

Valuable real estate: According to her will, Mr Jagger will inherit Scott's $8million condo at 200 Eleventh Avenue, where the designer was found dead last week

Bambrough also said that Tuesday’s 
funeral in Los Angeles had been in keeping with his sister’s wishes and 
that she had wanted Jagger to be in charge of the arrangements.

He said he wasn’t privy to details of his 49-year-old sister’s will.

'I haven’t heard anything at all about a will, other than there’s supposedly one out there,' Bambrough said.

Born Luann Bambrough and raised by an adoptive Mormon family, Jagger's long-time partner left a small town in Utah at age 17 to build a career as a fashion designer and stylist.

Scott had been estranged from her sister, Jan Bambrough Shane, who ended up being entirely excluded from the will along with their brother, Randy.

'Expect if otherwise provided in this 
will, I have intentionally omitted to provide herein for any other my 
heirs living at the date of my death,’ Scott wrote.   

Probate
 documents obtained by the paper detailed that Miss Scott owned a condo 
at 200 Eleventh Avenue in Manhattan worth $8million and another 
$1million in 'tangible personal property and various other assets,'  
reports the New York Post.

Miss Scott also added in her final will and testament: 'I have never been married. I have no children.'However, she later crossed out the word 'never' without providing a further explanation.

Scott and Jagger, 70, had been dating since 2001. The aging rock star was in Australia for a Rolling Stones tour when the designer killed herself.

At the time of her death, Miss Scott's fashion line was reportedly millions of dollars in debt.

Mr Jagger’s personal net worth is estimated to be around $305million.
