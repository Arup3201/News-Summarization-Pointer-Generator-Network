Disney has unveiled electronic wristbands that store
information and allow its theme parks to track visitors.

Magic Bands, as they are playfully called, completely do
away with paper tickets, room keys and even credit cards through the use of
microchips.

They also transmit personal information to sensor-wearing
mascots, log visitor buying habits and even tailor rides to the people on them,
according to the Broward-Palm Beach New Times.

It's magic!: Just wave the wristbands at sensors deployed around theme parks and you're let onto rides, can pay for food and even enter your hotel room

The waterproof rubber wristbands use RF
technology – a low frequency radio transmission currently used for things like
transit cards and some tap to pay technologies.

RF technology only works at close distances.

MagicBands replace theme park entry tickets and FastPasses, hotel
room keys and credit cards.

They send names and birthdates to mascots – leading to them possibly
greeting children by name.

‘Hi, Bobby! Happy Birthday!’ As the New Times put it.

People waiting on line for certain rides will have
entertainment and information fed to them on video screens based on observed
spending and park migration habits.

The theme park manages the monitoring of guests using the MyMagic+
‘vacation management system,’ according to the New Times.

The danger within: The wristbands use RFID technology, which techies posting to Disney forums worry can be cracked by even a cell phone

Happy birthday!: The data on the wristbands can also be used to tell mascots park visitors' names and birthdays, allowing them to provide personalized greetings

A consumer version of the platform is made available to
vacationers to manage the information added to the wristbands including park
passes, dining credits and even PhotoPasses.

Information is input using an app available in either of the
popular mobile app markets.

The MagicBands are currently in a limited beta testing
phase, according to Disney, but are expected to be made available to all theme
park guests.

Despite growing outrage over NSA spying and the increasing
lack of privacy on Facebook and other social media sites, vacationers can’t
wait to slap them on, according to comments on a well-read review of the
bracelets.

The review posted to Disney fan site MouseChat suggests the
only major problem with the bands, which can be adorned with charms depicting a
multitude of popular Disney characters, is their functionality.

No mention of privacy issues is made anywhere in the write-up.

They also track you: Park officials can also use the wristbands to track movements and chart spending habits

Tech buffs posting to one of many Disney theme park-related
forums expressed concerns that cell phones could access and possibly clone the
information stored on the bands.

Much of the criticism was leveled at Disney’s choice of ‘easily
readable’ RF technology over the more secure Near Field Communications (NFC)
standard.

Purchases made using the bands would require the use of a
PIN code, but only if they exceed $50, according to a previous New York Times
report.

The MagicBands review noted that it was nearly impossible to
get those PIN codes to work.

A Disney spokesperson also told the Times that no personal
information will be stored on the wristbands.

Park visitors commenting on the MouseChat review have had
mixed results – but none have spoken of privacy issues.
