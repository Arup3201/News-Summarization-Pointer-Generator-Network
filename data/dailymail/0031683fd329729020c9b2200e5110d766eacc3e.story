Dwindling in numbers, the original Routemaster is almost a thing of the past.

But nostalgic Londoners are being treated to a throwback this weekend with a fleet of the iconic buses on display.

Celebrating the Routemaster Association's Diamond Jubilee Celebration, around 130 buses drove through the capital's Finsbury Park today - including the first ones ever registered. 

Nostalgia: Crowds clamoured to photograph a rare gathering of the first 130 Routemaster buses in London's Finsbury Park to mark the 60th anniversary of the fleet

Iconic: Buses that have been sent to France, Scotland and Germany for other uses since they stopped transporting Londoners were recalled for the convention

RM1 vehicles from as far afield as Scotland, Germany and France have been called home to join the fleet, which will take another tour tomorrow.

Though some have been repainted in the years since they were used, many retain the adverts and posters of the time. 

Crowds lined the paths in the sun this morning watch the old double-deckers parade in convoy. 

Enthusiasts: Conductors and enthusiasts arrived at the event bearing vintage badges to honour the landmark occasion, which has been years in the planning

A thing of the past: The buses remained on London's streets until 2005, when bendy buses and new Routemasters were developed - though two routes still use them

Symbol of Britain: Although there are only two heritage routes that still run the original buses in London, they remain a worldwide symbol for the nation

Crowds: After a parade around Finsbury Park, in north London, the fleet lined up for spectators to get a closer look, while vintage film reels were projected on screens

Original: This rickety bus was used in London in the 1920s before trolleybuses were invented - a chunky version of the open-backed Routemasters that came in in 1954

And the nostalgia thoroughfare was completed with old film reels projected on TV screens, memorabilia stalls, and old fashioned food stands. 

The first prototype was developed between 1947 and 1956, with a brief to create a lighter, fuel-efficient vehicle.

Though it was three tonnes lighter than the chunky 56-seat trolleybuses, the final design managed to seat 64.

Colour code: Green Routemasters worked for London Transport's country bus division, which went from the edges of London out to places including Windsor

'Perfect design': The first prototype was developed between 1947 and 1956, with a brief to create a lighter, fuel-efficient vehicle

Revolutionary: Though it was three tonnes lighter than the chunky 56-seat trolleybuses, the final design managed to seat 64

Through the ages: With badges from the 1950s up to an Olympic-themed 2012 badge, this conductor was decked out in Routemaster memorabilia

With the Routemaster's longevity, examples were painted to celebrate both the Queen's Silver and Golden Jubilees. 

In 1977, 25 Routemasters were painted silver to celebrate the Silver Jubilee and, in 2002, 50 buses were painted gold.

Green Routemasters worked for London Transport's country bus division to destinations including Windsor.

Celebrations: Tomorrow the bespoke fleet will parade again in a 'through the decades' special, set to draw in hundreds of fanatics from around the world

Old fashioned: More than 2,000 Routemasters were built over the decades but now only 1,000 still exist, so this scene of one driving through London is a rarity
