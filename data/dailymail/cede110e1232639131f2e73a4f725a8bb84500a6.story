Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg addressed young people at a business start-up centre in London

Nick Clegg weighed into the row about rising energy bills yesterday, claiming that scrapping green taxes would make household bills higher in the long run.

He struck a different note from David Cameron, who said last week that green levies should be phased out as quickly as possible.

The levies account for 10 per cent of the average energy bill and are set to reach a third by 2020.

Despite the focus on how to reduce the cost of living, Mr Clegg said yesterday that subsidies for windfarms and nuclear power were needed to spur the investment needed to keep the lights on.

Addressing young people at a business start-up centre in London, he said: ‘Like everyone else I want us to strain every sinew to keep those bills down – but I don’t think anyone should think that by scrapping all the levies suddenly with one bound we will be free. We won’t’.

‘Actually what will happen is that you will have less investment, probably higher bills over time and an increase in fuel poverty. That cannot be the right answer. The whole point of putting some of these levies on bills is to make sure that we do keep lights on.’

Mr Clegg added: ‘People’s bills go down over time by making sure that their homes are more properly insulated and that fuel poverty is properly tackled. Of course we need to keep everything under review – I don’t want to see a penny more going on to bills than is strictly justified.’

In York last week, the Prime Minister said that green taxes ‘should not be there for a moment longer than are necessary... as soon as those industries can pay for themselves’.

Mr Clegg’s remarks came after the boss of a power firm warned that bills could rise even more sharply than expected because of a £1billion new tax to boost green energy.

Alistair Phillips-Davies, chief executive of SSE, which last week announced an inflation-busting 8 per cent increase in bills, criticised the ‘carbon price floor’ imposed by ministers in April.

He released figures showing the cost to domestic consumers of the carbon price floor would be £194million this year, £374million next year and would soar to £709million in 2015.

This means another £7 on the average household bill this year, £15 next year and £26 in 2015. It was likely ‘to have a significant impact on consumer bills’ in future, he said.

The tax is designed to make suppliers use less gas, coal and oil and support the growth of low-carbon energy. But analysts have warned that it could drive 60,000 more households into fuel poverty and Tony Cocker, boss of E.ON UK, has described it as ‘a stealth poll tax’.

The carbon price floor is a tax on fossil fuels used to generate electricity. Power plants and manufacturers have to pay £16 for every ton of carbon dioxide they emit, rising to £30 by 2020. The cost is passed on to customers.

The Department of Energy and Climate Change forecasts that all the various green levies will add £286 a year to the average power bill by 2020. Officials claim this is less than households would pay without green energy.
