Whether to have a wedding list is a dilemma many couples tying the knot face today. Most have already lived together and have all the household items they need - so what they really want is cold, hard cash.

Tradition dictates it's somewhat rude to demand money from your friends and family - but one couple have come up with a novel way to do it without causing offence.

Gemma Daborn and her husband, Marcus, from North London, created a 'reverse wedding list' when they married in 2010.

Wedding list dilemma: Gemma and Marcus tied the knot in 2010, but having lived together first, already had everything they needed

Give and receive: The couple invited their guests to buy items off them which they no longer needed

Novel idea: The pair created a wedding list where they could sell lots in return for money for their honeymoon

They put on it all the items they owned which they no longer needed and invited their guests to purchase them.

Their friends and family got something for themselves and the newlyweds could then afford the honeymoon of their dreams.

Roll up, roll up: Toys were available to buy for £20

Fun: The couple's guests took the wedding list in good humour

Going, going, gone: Items guests buy which they don't actually need can be donated to charity

Gemma explained to the MailOnline: 'A reverse wedding list is where guests are invited to buy gifts from you rather than for you. My husband and I did this when we got married in 2010.

'Like most couples we had lived together for several years, we had a flat crammed full of stuff and, if anything, we needed to de-clutter, not be bought more toasters and blenders.

'What we ideally wanted was money for our honeymoon but we felt awkward asking our friends and family for cash. So we took all the household items we no longer need and listed then and invited guests to buy them from us.'

The couple were delighted their guests embraced the spirit of the gift list - as Gemma admitted some of the items on sale weren't exactly must-haves - with prices starting at £10.

Make them laugh: The list allowed Gemma and Marcus to ask their friends for money without causing offence

Cheap and cheerful: Items were affordable so their guests could spend as little as they wanted

She said: 'We had so much stuff we no longer needed - two blenders, two printers, loads of duplicate DVDs and CDs - so this seemed like the perfect solution to de-clutter and raise some cash at the same time.

'We gave guests the option to donate the item they purchased to charity if they didn’t actually want to keep it themselves and we also listed non-material things, like dinner for two at ours.'

After having a perfect wedding and honeymoon, the couple went on to have a son, Oscar, in September 2012.

Paradise found: The generosity of their guests meant the couple could have a dream honeymoon

Expanding family: Oscar was born in September 2012 and Gemma decided to launch her gift list as a business while on maternity leave

Get your own reverse wedding list: Now other couples can create a list where their wedding guests can buy a gift 'from you not for you'

It was while on maternity leave that Gemma considered sharing her wacky wedding list idea with the world and turning it into a business.

Now she has set up the website reverseweddinglist.com where other couples can sign up and sell their wares to their guests.

Gemma said: 'Setting up the business has been a challenge with a young baby but I'll really proud of the site. I hope there are couples getting married out there who want to create a reverse wedding list of their own.'
