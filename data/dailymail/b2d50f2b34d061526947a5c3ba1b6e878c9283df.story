NYPD Sgt. Frank Marra (above) reported seeing a ghostly lady at the Staten Island landfill, his book reveals

A retired NYPD cop who sifted through ten tons of debris from the September 11th attacks, reported seeing a ghostly lady at the Staten Island landfill, a new book reveals.

However, Sgt. Frank Marra, 48, was not the only one who saw the specter, who a psychic medium has explained could have been a spirit, 'soul collector', guiding people to the afterlife, according to the New York Post.

In his book, From Landfill to Hallowed Ground, Marra details his experience searching through rubble and remains of the World Trade Center attacks from September 2001 to February 2002 at Fresh Kills landfill.

While there, volunteers found 54,000 personal objects and helped identify 1,200 people who perished.

The 17-year veteran cop shares about the spirit he and other volunteers saw at the Staten Island landfill, also known as 'The Hill'.

This is where the African-American woman was spotted, dressed in white like a Red Cross worker during the Second World War,  carrying a tray of sandwiches.

The spirit Marra and other cops reported seeing was an African-American woman, dressed in white like a Red Cross worker during the Second World War, was seen carrying a tray of sandwiches (above jewelry recovered from the World Trade Center debris held in a trailer at the Staten Island landfill in 2002)

'I thought she was trying to help, being first responders,' said Marra.

He only saw her a few times and in the distance, more than 50 yards away each time, but he recalls that it clearly looked like a person. 

And while they were rare sightings, he stashed them away as memories, until about a year later when he spoke to a retired crime-scene detective who mentioned the ghost.

The detective asked him if he ever heard stories about the 'old Red Cross worker trying to serve sandwiches and coffees out by the sifters', which brought Marra's memories of her rushing back to mind.

'It hit me like a ton of bricks - I had put that dormant,' said Marra. 'It just reminded me that I remembered seeing her.'

Along with the Red Cross worker, other cops and volunteers witnessed seeing other things while in the landfill from shadows to large black masses (above NYPD officers who worked at Fresh Kills landfill bow their heads in front of a pile of debris on July 15, 2002 during the closing ceremony for the Staten Island landfill)

The retired cop who now resides in New Jersey with his wife and three sons also notes how the landfill, with all of its memories from September 11, quickly became a holy ground (left debris and damaged fire trucks at the Staten Island landfill in 2002; right, Marra's book, From Landfill to Hallowed Ground)

The retired cop who now resides in New Jersey with his wife and three sons also notes how the landfill, with its memories of the tragic September 11 attacks, quickly became a holy ground.

Marra said: 'As time passed we realized how many people's ashes and DNA still remain at the landfill. 

'It was clear this became a holy ground, a place of rest for many who would never be recovered, a cemetery without tombstones.'
