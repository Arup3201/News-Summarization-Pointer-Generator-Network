A dilapidated farmhouse with no kitchen or bathroom which is situated on land once used by soldiers defending Hadrian’s wall has gone up for sale.

The two-bedroom 19th-century home in Gilsland’s remote countryside on the Northumberland border has a price tag of £700,000 despite the fact there are holes in the floor.

Underheugh Farm and its 56-acre estate, which is just 500m from Birdoswald Roman Fort, has been put up for sale by English Heritage who bought the 
property when they purchased Birdoswald Fort from the local authority 30 years ago.

The two-bedroom 19th-century  farmhouse at Underheugh Farm and its 56-acre estate has gone up for sale with a £700,000 price tag. Property consultancy Carter Jonas in Cumbria said it would need to be completely renovated

The run-down farmhouse is within a stone's throw from Hadrian's Wall. It has fallen into disrepair after being bought by English Heritage as part of a package to purchase Birdoswald Fort 30 years ago

Helen Lancaster, from property 
consultancy Carter Jonas in Cumbria, said the estate has the potential to 'create a special home, rural business or unique retreat'.

She said: 
'It’s an extremely unspoilt area and it’s very serene and beautiful. It 
was tenanted 30 years ago and people can remember it being a working
 farm. It’s got a beautiful courtyard and they can remember it being
 lively and active.

'It’s a site of specialist scientific interest site and would attract Natural England funding.'

The estate includes recently improved woodland, pasture and 1.3 miles of single bank fishing on the River Irthing. The nearby Birdoswald Fort sits up a bank from the house around 500m away and the estate’s land would have at one time been well protected by Roman soldiers patrolling the wall.

The farmhouse has two bedrooms and original slab stone floors, but needs complete renovation and updating.

The interior of the farmhouse is completely unlivable with holes in the floor and no working kitchen or bathroom. However, it does still have its original slab stone floors, stone sconces and quoin stones

The estate is situated on the Northumberland border on land once gazed upon by Roman soldiers defending Hadrian's Wall

Mrs Lancaster said it could be extended using the adjoining outbuildings which are set around a courtyard, and it also has former vegetable and flower gardens.

A rare sandbank close to the river is also home to over 70 pairs of sand martins, and the estate’s ancient woodland has roe deer, great spotted woodpecker, blackcaps and willow warblers.

The fort and Underheugh were bought as a package by English Heritage in 1984, with the farmhouse being left to fall into disrepair. The estate can be viewed on January 17.
