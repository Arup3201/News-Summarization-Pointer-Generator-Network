Scientists have developed a new battery-powered defibrillator that can be implanted under the skin to shock failing hearts back to life.

S-CID, or the subcutaneous internal cardioverter-defibrillator, is implanted in the chest and analyses the heart's rhythm via a sensor without having to pierce any area of the organ at all.

The device can then deliver 80 joules to 
the chest wall, 'much like you see on a television shows where a doctor 
will say, "Stat," and shock a patient with paddles,' said Dr. Manoj Panday, director of cardiac electrophysiology at the University of Texas Health Science Center.

State of the art: S-CID, or the subcutaneous internal cardioverter-defibrillator, is a new battery-powered defibrillator that can be implanted under the skin and shocks failing hearts back to life

'Having a defibrillator that's there as 
an insurance plan, so to speak, is important because it helps to protect
 them whenever it may occur but at the same time allows them to live a 
normal life and not have to think about the defibrillator,' Panday said.
 'It's there doing its job silently all the time.'

One of the first patients to test the new technology was Ruben Rivera, who has a weak heart muscle and heart valve problems.

But the 62-year-old San Antonio resident has no regrets since becoming the first patient here to undergo the procedure late last month.

'I feel good,' said Rivera, acknowledging that while his heart is still weak, 'I have peace of mind, which makes it feel that much better.'

'I know that if I go into cardiac arrest, this apparatus will take care of my needs,' he told the San Antonio Express-News.

Rivera is one of hundreds of thousands of patients in the United States that have cardiomyopathy, or a weak heart, which puts them at a higher risk of dangerous abnormal heart rhythms, said Dr. Panday.

Tense moment: The tensest moment of the procedure came after the device was inserted in the chest. Panday and his team tested it by inducing a cardiac arrest and then watching as the device sent a shock trembling through Perez's still unconscious body, jolting his heart back into life

Cardiomyopathy can be caused by 
coronary artery disease, a prior heart attack, a viral infection or an 
adverse reaction to certain medications, Panday said. Hundreds of 
thousands more people in the United States may be at risk of 
life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, he said.

Cardiomyopathy is a disease of the heart muscle.

It can be caused by coronary artery disease, a prior heart attack, a viral infection or an adverse reaction to certain medications

It can also run in families and can affect one or many members of a family.

There are three different types of cardiomyopathy and each affects the size and shape of the heart.

They are:

Cardiomyopathy can also affect the heart's electrical system.

There is a small risk of sudden death in people with cardiomyopathy.

Panday
 implanted the new device, created by Boston Scientific, in Rivera last 
month at the Audie Murphy VA Hospital. The company selected the initial 
physicians for the procedure based on their experience and ability to 
offer this type of care to patients, he said.

It
 is not the first implantable defibrillator on the market, but doctors 
say is a huge step forward in the field because traditional ones 
required puncturing a blood vessel and screwing an electrode or lead 
into the heart to conduct the charge.

The
 new device, however, was designed to avoid some of the resulting risks,
 which include puncturing the lung or the heart or introducing bacteria 
that could cling to the defibrillator and cause a serious infection.

Rivera was a good candidate for the new device because a previous surgery had caused a bacterial infection that entered his bloodstream, Panday said.

At University Hospital on Monday, Panday implanted another such device in Leonardo Perez, 50, of San Antonio.

Perez said he had triple bypass surgery last year and felt lucky to benefit from the new technology.

'Let's get going,' he said, eager to get the hour-long procedure underway. 'I'm ready.'

Once
 Perez was sedated, Panday cut a pocket a few inches below his left 
armpit to insert the generator, which is about the size of a deck of 
cards.

Using two small 
incisions, Panday ran the lead — a thin, insulated wire — across from 
the pocket to the center of the chest and then up the chest.

The
 battery lasts about five years before the generator needs to be 
replaced in an outpatient procedure. The battery runs down faster than 
the traditional defibrillator because it requires a greater charge — 
it's not as close to the heart.

The
 tensest moment of the procedure came after the device was inserted in 
the chest. Panday and his team tested it by inducing a cardiac arrest 
and then watching as the device sent a shock trembling through Perez's 
still unconscious body, jolting his heart back into a normal heart 
rhythm — ready to save his life should he need it again.
