A  pair of love-struck pet pugs got married in a £2,000 ceremony, complete with wedding dresses, tuxedos and a 'best dog'.

Bride Betty dazzled in a £100 custom-made white dress while Albert wore a smart tux topped off with a trilby and a bow tie.

Wedding rings were exchanged and attached to collars in the moving ceremony.

The pair fell head over tail in love after meeting as puppies and soon became inseparable.

They even had a joint stag and hen party at their local pub - where Betty wore the traditional 'L' plate and bunny ears to dance the night away with her doggie pals.

Their owner Christine Reynolds, 52, a dog groomer from Milton Keynes, said: 'I know what people must think.

'I am barking mad, but I know my pugs are in love so getting them married seem like the right thing to do.

'Now that they are married they can sleep in the same bed and hopefully have some puppies together.'

Christine bought Albert, now two, in 2012 to keep her elderly cocker spaniel, Hester, company. One year later she bought Betty, now aged one, and the pair hit it off instantly.

Guests: The pair fell in love after meeting as puppies a year ago and they become inseparable. Their pup friends came along to celebrate their union

The pampered pooches were constantly eating from the same bowl, snuggling on the sofa, washing each other and following each other around adoringly.

So Christine planned a beautiful white wedding at Kitz-Katz cattery in Desborough, Northants., on Sunday.

Incredibly, a week before the big day, the pug couple had a hen night and stag do at the local pub.

Albert wore a suit, and Betty wore an L plate and bunny ears as she danced the night away with her doggy pals while drinking dog-friendly cocktails.

Christine said: 'Both dogs had a great time. It was their last night of single life. Luckily neither dog was unfaithful, and they were both happy to snuggle up together at the end of the night in their beds.'

Leading up to the big day, Betty had her nails done and her fur trimmed. Dressed in a white gown with matching wedding lingerie, a diamante-studded veil and holding a bouquet of flowers in her mouth, Betty walked down the aisle to the traditional wedding march.

Christine said: 'They are such a cute couple. Albert is a gentleman and always looks after Betty. As we were doing the vows I started tearing up, it was so beautiful.

'I know people might think I'm a bit mad, but I love my dogs and they are so in love a wedding seemed like the right thing to do.

'My kids are all grown up and they find it hilarious. But I am pug-obsessed. My whole house is covered in pug photos, pug decorations, pug pillows and pug duvets. They are just so sweet!'

Meanwhile, her long-suffering-husband, Julian Reynolds, 43, simply said: 'It's all bonkers.'
