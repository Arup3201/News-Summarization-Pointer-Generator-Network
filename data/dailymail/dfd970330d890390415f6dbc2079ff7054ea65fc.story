Google has bought a satellite firm as the first step in its project to improve its maps and bring the internet to developing countries.

The $500 million acquisition of California firm Skybox will initially be used to boost the quality of Google's maps images as it battles Apple.

Skybox has already hit the headlines for capturing the first HD video footage of Earth from its tiny satellite - which many dubbed at the time as being 'like live Google maps.'

Google is buying Skybox Imaging in a deal that could serve as a launching pad for the company to send its own fleet of satellites in to space. These satellites would take aerial pictures and provide online access to remote areas of the world. This photo of Kiev, Ukraine was taken by Skybox on 18 February 2014

SkySat-1, which was launched in November, captured up to 90-second video clips at 30 frames per second.

Satellites today are capable of taking imagery better than a metre in resolution, but they weigh thousands of kilograms. SkySat-1 is 20 times smaller than traditional satellites.

The circuitry that drives it is about the size of a phone book and consumes less power than a 100w light bulb.

The U.S. group, Skybox Imaging, is now planning a constellation of 24 satellites that will be able to cover almost the entire expanse of the Earth. 

SkySat-2, an identical version of SkySat-1, is scheduled to launch in 2014.

Google is also believed to be mulling plans to launch its own fleet of satellites to bring the internet to developing countries - a project Facebook is also pursuing.

Google plans to use Skybox's satellite already in orbit to supplement the material that it licenses from more than 1,000 sources, including other satellite companies such as DigitalGlobe and Astrium.

Eventually, though, Skybox could turn into another Google 'moonshot' - a term that CEO Larry Page has embraced for describing ambitious projects that could take several years to materialize.

Google hopes to build more satellites that could be used to beam Internet access to points around the world.

'Skybox’s satellites will help keep Google Maps accurate with up-to-date imagery,' the firm said.

'Over time, we also hope that Skybox’s team and technology will be able to help improve Internet access and disaster relief — areas Google has long been interested in.'

That would expand an effort that Google began a year ago when it unveiled "Project Loon" — a venture featuring jellyfish-shaped balloons equipped with antennas to bring the Internet to parts of the world without the proper wiring to get online.

As the owner of the world's most popular search engine and email service, Google typically benefits when more people are on the Internet to see the ads that generate most of the company's annual revenue of $55 billion.

Page and other Google executives say they are primarily interested in getting more people on to the Internet to create a more egalitarian and knowledgeable society.

The expansion into satellites comes two months after Google bought drone maker Titan Aerospace for an undisclosed amount.

Google made about 250 acquisitions during the past decade, using many of them to expand into new markets, including maps and mobile devices.

To the frustration of some investors, Google also has been spending billions of dollars exploring new frontiers of technology, including driverless cars, Internet-connected headwear, robots and a startup called Calico striving to find ways to slow the aging process.

Other investors have applauded Google for having the vision and audacity to make big bets on bold ideas that analysts say could hatch lucrative products in the rapidly changing technology industry.

Google's most-widely traded class of stock dipped $2.81 to $567.92 in Tuesday's afternoon trading.

Skybox is a 5-year-old startup in Mountain View, California, located a mile-and-half from Google's headquarters in the same Silicon Valley city.

Skybox develops small, relatively cheap satellites.

Traditional satellites capable of taking imagery at better than 1 meter resolution weigh thousands of kilograms, which makes it prohibitively expensive to launch enough of them to capture timely imagery.

The firm says it has produced similar performance in a box 20x smaller.

'The circuitry that drives our satellites - providing power, attitude control, communications, thermal management, and imaging support - are about the size of a phone book and consume less power than a 100w light bulb,' it says.

'We've integrated the latest, greatest, and fastest commercially available FPGAs, processors, and memory to ensure our small satellites pack the largest possible punch.'

Led by aerospace industry veteran Tom Ingersoll, Skybox has been working on additional satellites that should be easier to complete with Google's backing.

'The time is right to join a company who can challenge us to think even bigger and bolder, and who can support us in accelerating our ambitious vision,' Skybox said in a blog post.

Skybox had previously raised about $91 million in venture capital.

The company says it employs about 100 people.

Google is hoping to gain regulatory approval to take control of Skybox Imaging within the next few months.
