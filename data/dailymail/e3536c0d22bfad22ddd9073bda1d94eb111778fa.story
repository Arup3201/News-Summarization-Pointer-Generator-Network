Scientists are still struggling to explain the appearance of a giant sinkhole in the Yamal Peninsula, a remote region of Russia that translates as 'the end of the world'.

So far theories have ranged from meteorite strikes to subsurface ice, and even UFOs, but no solid answer has yet been found.

A research team sent to investigate the phenomenon is hoping to unearth more information about the baffling feature.

Experts are unsure what caused a giant hole in Siberia earlier this week, found in the Yamal Peninsula which is also known as the 'end of the world'. The phenomenon was revealed in incredible footage from a helicopter, a still of which is pictured here

One of the more popular theories is that the giant hole was caused by a phenomenon known as a pingo, illustrated below.

This is a subsurface accumulation of ice that has been covered by land.

When the ice melts it can leave behind a gaping hole that it once filled.

The other favoured theory is that the hole was caused by an explosion of methane underground.

The Yamal Peninsula is rich in natural gas, with its resources extensively tapped by Russia, and a mixture of water, salt and gas could result in an explosion.

The other theory is that it was caused by a meteorite, but most experts have ruled this possibility out as the phenomenon does not resemble normal impact craters.

Remarkable video of the hole in Siberia was reported earlier this week.

Aerial images suggest it may be up to 260 feet (80 metres) wide but has an unknown depth.

The predominant theory so far is that the feature is a ‘pingo,’ reports the Sunday Morning Herald.

A pingo is a large chunk of ice that is located underground that can create a hole in the ground when it melts.

‘Certainly from the images I’ve seen it looks like a periglacial feature, perhaps a collapsed pingo,’ Dr Chris Fogwill of the University of New South Wales said.

‘This is obviously a very extreme version of that, and if there’s been any interaction with the gas in the area, that is a question that could only be answered by going there.’

Others, however, have pointed to the abundance of natural gas in the region as a possible explanation for the hole.

'It’s certainly mysterious,' geologist David Wilshaw, president of Florida-based geology business Britannia Solutions, tells MailOnline.

The exact reason behind the hole is a mystery. It may have been caused by a pingo, illustration shown. When the ice eventually melts, it can leave a gaping hole in the ground

'I don’t think that it’s a “sinkhole”, which is a phenomenon caused by the downwards collapse of the land surface into an existing cavity in the ground.'

He also adds it's unlikely to be a meteor strike as it 'would not leave such a deep and steep sided hole, and the impact pattern would be different.'

Wilshaw continued: 'There is a ridge of material around the edge, so this suggests some kind of “explosion” out of the ground.

'The reports I’ve seen suggest that this is not an area of volcanic activity, though.

'Most likely it was caused by the explosion of a pocket of natural gas that had accumulated near to the surface, perhaps in an existing underground cavern system, that somehow either ignited - explaining the “scorched” edge - or expanded until it reached some critical pressure that it blew the permafrost surface off.'

He added that the feature was 'unique, hence all of the head scratching!'

The region, with the hole denoted by the marker here, is known for its permafrost and pingos, which could account for the formation of this bizarre phenomenon

The Yamal Peninsula is a remote region of Russia that is rich in natural gas, which has led some experts to suggest that the hole may have been caused by the ignition and subsequent explosion of methane underground. The region is also known for its reindeer, pictured here

One of the more popular theories is that the giant hole was caused by a phenomenon known as a pingo. This is a subsurface accumulation of ice that has been covered by land.

Other experts have also cast their opinion on the phenomenon.

'I am not really familiar with the geological and climatic setting of the “sinkhole” location in Siberia, however, it does appear to be in a very cold climate area therefore it is possibly a “pingo,”' sinkhole expert Dr Clive Edmonds of Reading's Peter Brett Associates told MailOnline.

'These features are associated with very cold glacial landscapes where groundwater lenses freeze beneath a soil cover, for example, and as more groundwater is drawn into the freezing lens of water the ground above lifts to form small conical hills hundreds of metres across and high.

'If seasonal climate change occurs then the frozen lens of water would melt and leak away reversing the hydraulic pressure and flow of water when the pingo formed.

'The unsupported top of such a feature could then possibly collapse to create a crater as seen.

'Alternatively the chemistry of the groundwater being drawn in to the forming pingo may change (for example, salty water instead of fresh water), which could cause changes in the ice volume.

'There is clearly much speculation going on and really it needs people on the ground investigating the particular conditions and geology present to confirm what is happening.'

He added that 'it appears unlikely to be a true “sinkhole”, in other words a ground settlement or collapse over a void formed in a soluble rock such as limestone, gypsum or salt.'

Dr Edmonds also added that climate change could pose a problem, saying: 'I guess that climate change causing the atmosphere to warm would lead to a lessening of the severity of the climate in glacial areas and therefore pingo collapse might become more commonplace in such areas in time.

'We’ll have to wait and see!'

The mysterious hole is in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Region, which is some 20 miles (32 kilometres) from the Bovanenkovo gas field

Yamal has some of the world’s largest natural gas reserves, which has led to extensive pumping of the region.

This caused some experts to suggest the hole could be the consequence of a giant explosion underground.

According to the Siberian Times Anna Kurchatova from the Sub-Arctic Scientific Research Centre thinks a mixture of water, salt and gas could have ignited such an explosion.

The region is geologically quite young, at about 10,000 years, and its possible gas was trapped in ice beneath the surface, but global warming has melted the ice and released the gas, like popping a champagne cork.

A spokesman for the Russian Emergencies Ministry, meanwhile, previously ruled out the possibility of it being a meteorite impact crater to the Siberian Times.

‘We can definitely say that it is not a meteorite. No details yet,’ they said.

Experts also say that the darkening around the inner rim of the crater indicates 'severe burning' which scorched its edges.

The expedition currently taking place is being organised by the Yamal authorities and includes experts from Russia's Centre for the Study of the Arctic, and also the Cryosphere Institute of the Academy of Sciences.

They plan to take samples of soil, air and water from the scene and they will be accompanied by a specialist from Russia's Emergencies Ministry in an attempt to solve the mystery once and for all.
