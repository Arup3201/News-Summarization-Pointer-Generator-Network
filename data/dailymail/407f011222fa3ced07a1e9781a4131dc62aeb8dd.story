Jim Davidson was banned from the funeral of long-term friend Margaret Thatcher as he faced historic sexual abuse allegations.

The controversial comedian and staunch Thatcherite met regularly with the former prime minister he called 'Maggie' throughout her premiership.

When she died in April at the age of 88, he was under arrest in connection with Operation Yewtree, set up following the Jimmy Savile scandal, and denied an invite to the service at St Paul's Cathedral.

Now cleared of the allegations, Mr Davidson, 60, has spoken of his heartbreak, blasting the Conservative party for 'stabbing me in the back'.

He told the Sunday Express: 'It broke my heart, it really struck home as I knew her well. I used to go and sit and have tea with her.

'I got a call from the British Forces' Foundation to say "You can't go to Maggie's funeral".

'I said 'Why? Who has banned me? They said 'Mark, her butler, got a call from The State', which must have been Downing Street.'

Mr Davidson, winner of this year's Celebrity Big Brother, was arrested in January 2012, and again in March, over claims made by 10 women - including one in the Falklands Islands - which he denied.

In August, the Crown Prosecution Service ruled the women's allegations were not strong enough for there to be a realistic prospect of securing a conviction.

The TV star, who shot to fame 
presenting the Generation Game, was first detained at Heathrow as he 
arrived back in the UK ahead of a planned appearance on last year's 
series of Celebrity Big Brother.

Speaks out: Davidson, 60, who won this year's Celebrity Big Brother, is writing a book about his 'year of hell'

Mr Davidson had flown into London to give a series of interviews to journalists in advance of his appearance on the show.

TV executives quickly held crisis meetings and replaced him with someone else.

After his initial arrest he told friends: 'I am no Jimmy Savile. I have never forced myself on a girl in my life. I once let a drunken dancer sleep in my bed, but I never touched her. I am a gentleman.'

The former Conservative supporter is now writing a book documenting his 'year of hell', in which he will address missing Baroness Thatcher's funeral.

He now intends to hold his own memorial service at her resting place in the grounds of Royal Hospital Chelsea.

The Iron Lady was known to be a fan and close friend of Mr Davidson since they met at a charity event for his charity supporting military personnel.

Former Tory MP Gyles Brandreth spoke of the pair's friendship at the time of her death.

He
 said: 'Mrs Thatcher was a great fan of the comedian, not only because 
he was so entertaining but because of the way he entertained the troops.

'And she was the patron of his British Forces Foundation.'
