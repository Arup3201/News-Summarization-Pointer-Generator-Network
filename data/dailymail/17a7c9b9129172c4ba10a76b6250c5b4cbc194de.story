Mayor for Newark, Cory Booker, plans to run for governor of New Jersey one day - and it seems that he has already begun grooming himself, so to speak.

The rising Democrat star has revealed that he regularly sneaks out of his home for midnight manicures and pedicures.

The 43-year-old politician told Du Jour magazine, a new luxury title, that he believes pedicures are 'transformative'.

Curiously, he claimed that he visited his local '24-hour mani-pedi place' in order to avoid being spotted by others, despite having spilled the beans to the publication.

He explained: 'Being a public figure, people talk smack about you, so I... go in the middle of the night. I had an ex-girlfriend who ruined me in terms of my macho, ex-football-player self. She turned me onto mani-pedis.'

Labeling the habit, which is more often associated with females, a 'guilty pleasure', he then said: 'Look, manis are good, but pedis - there's something... transformative'.

Far more on topic, Mr Booker also spoke about his professional life, admitting that he was unsure what his long-term plans for his mayoral term involved.

'I would consider running for governor, absolutely,' he said. 'But I don't know if I would do that over staying where I am.

'Will I run for a higher office against a sitting governor or a senator of my own party? I do not know. I think the window closes very soon on some of those options, so either I proactively decide or it'll be a de facto decision.'

It comes after news that the Democrat party has not offered Mr Booker a headline speaking role at the Democratic National Convention next month.

He had called attacks on private equity 'nauseating' in unscripted remarks on May 20 about ads Barack Obama ran about Bain 
Capital, the former company of presumptive GOP nominee Mitt Romney.

'Men don't want women to recoil in 
horror when they see their toes'

Mr Booker joins a growing number of men who are turning to the traditionally-female grooming habits in order to take care of themselves.

MailOnline reporter Andy Jones wrote in April: 'Thirty per cent more men than last year 
are seeking help to banish their bunions - and not just effete 
metrosexuals.

'The Aveda Institute reports an increase in the numbers of 
businessmen, bankers and builders slipping off their brogues for a foot 
overhaul.'

Aveda chiropodist Jess Sproson said: 'Men don't want women to recoil in 
horror when they see their toes. They are finally realizing their feet deserve more than just standing 
on. Men have the same problems as women - dry skin, calluses, ingrown 
toenails - it's just they tend to ignore them.'
