Mmmmm carbs! New research has revealed that bread isn't the cause of weight gain or bloating although 43 per cent of woman avoid eating bread when trying to lose weight

The national study of more than 1,000 women aged between 25 and 65 taken on behalf of popular bakery, Bakers Delight, is aiming to bust those bread myths and change attitudes towards eating bread.

Once seen as a relatively healthy part of our diets, bread these days is getting a bad wrap, touted as the reason why we gain weight, blamed for putting on the bloat, while the gluten used in bread is being seen as the all round bad guy.

The research also found that more than a third of Aussie women indicated they are looking for healthier bread options with 65 per cent believing information about healthier bread alternatives should be more accessible.

Parents are also limiting their kids' bread intake with 15 per cent of Aussie mums cutting back because they don't want them to get overweight.

The statistics : National survey of more than 1,000 Australian women has busted some of the myths about eating bread

While some women avoid bread, there's no denying they can't resist bread for it's taste, the survey revealing a high 83 per cent of women eat it because it is delicious

Nutritionist and health expert, Sharon Natoli of Food and Nutrition Australia says since Dr Atkins published his new ‘Diet Revolution’ in the 1990’s and other low carb fad diets quickly followed, it has created a stigma associated with eating carbs.

She says the survey results were reflective of current nutritional debates which continue to fuel uncertainty around healthy bread options.

'It reflects a loss of basic nutritional knowledge around healthy bread options,' she said.

'Many women are unaware of the long list of benefits offered by wholemeal and low GI breads, and often gluten free diets can be more harmful than good in terms of increased sugar levels.' 

'The right bread choice can offer numerous health benefits including digestive health, sustained energy and an all round healthier heart mind and body,' said Ms Natoli.

She says there's no evidence on its own that contributes to weight gain.

'Large studies of populations show that people who have higher intakes of whole grain foods, such as whole grain breads, are less likely to be overweight or gain weight over time.

'Many women are unaware of the significant nutritional benefits of wholegrain bread including fibre, B vitamins, magnesium and iron,' she said.

More info please! Women say they want more information to make the right choice on what bread to buy according to their needs and lifestyle

Ms Natoli agrees it very important for every consumer to have access to all the information they need to make the right choice when buying bread to make their needs and lifestyle.

'Kids may benefit from bread that provides omega 3s along with the usual benefits of fibre and B vitamins while people concerned about heart health may prefer a bread that is high in seeds and wholegrains.

'There are many different breads on the market so understanding your needs and matching this with the benefits of the loaf is important,' she said. 

'Bread is a food that national health authorities recommend daily as part of a healthy, balanced diet due to its important contribution to nutrient intakes, so there is no reason to feel guilty about eating bread.' 

'While some people can find bread contributes to bloat, it is important not to mistake this for other causes of bloating and have these investigated first, before cutting bread out of your diet,' she said.

Can't resist a slice! Despite some Aussie women cutting back on bread because of myths that it causes weight gain, on average they eat bread about five times a week

A case study of 42 year old mother of two, Angela, also found that ditching the carbs won't make much of a difference.

She completely cut out bread from her diet for a while but reported seeing no difference in her weight and felt no less bloated.

Despite those shying away from bread, research tells us that a number of Aussie women are still happy to munch down on carbs, with on average, women eating bread at least five times a week.

And there's no denying most can't resist bread for it's taste, the survey revealing a high 83 per cent of women eat it because it is delicious.

And there's also the convenience factor of quickly putting together a sandwich or chucking it in the toaster, 73 per cent admitted they eat bread because it is convenient.
