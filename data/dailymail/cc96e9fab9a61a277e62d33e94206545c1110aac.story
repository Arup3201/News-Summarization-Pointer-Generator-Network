Mike Ashley holds the key to the future of convicted rapist Ched Evans.

Oldham Athletic stalled on signing the 26-year-old former Sheffield United striker on Monday, stating that they would ‘continue to have conversations with representative bodies such as the PFA’ before making a decision.

But two club sponsors immediately threatened to withdraw their backing if the League One club signed Evans — who was due to report for training on Monday but in the end did not show — and on Monday night Newcastle United owner Ashley came under pressure to withdraw Sports Direct’s sponsorship as well.

That particular deal is worth about £1million  to Oldham over five years and club chairman and owner Simon Corney — currently in New York — would almost certainly be forced to abort his pursuit of Evans if Ashley acted on a personal request from Northumbria Police and Crime Commissioner Vera Baird.

In a letter to Ashley she wrote: ‘If Oldham Athletic decide to appoint him, I would urge you to withdraw Sports Direct sponsorship at the club. It is tantamount to saying that sexual abuse is OK as long as you can play football.

‘My office works closely with Newcastle United Foundation and has funded a number of initiatives working with young people to help them understand what is right and wrong.’

Shirt sponsors CM Solicitors released a statement on Tuesday morning.  

'As secondary shirt sponsors, we are obviously aware of on-going speculation concerning the possible engagement of Ched Evans by Oldham Athletic,' it read. 

'Whilst there are many difficult considerations with regards to the matter, we believe that this is solely a matter for the club and we are confident that they will make the right decision in all of the circumstances.

'Whatever the outcome we are and will remain proud sponsors of the club going forward.'
