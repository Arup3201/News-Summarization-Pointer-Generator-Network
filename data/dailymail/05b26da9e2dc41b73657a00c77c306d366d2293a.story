We've all gone into a restaurant planning to order something healthy - only to end up devouring the most calorific option.

Now scientists say they have worked out why we get so easily derailed when dining out.

They say the answer may not lie with a lack of willpower or judgement - but could actually be the menu's fault.

Diners can be derailed from healthy eating simply by the way a menu is designed, researchers say

'What you order may have less to do with what you want  - and more to do with a menu's layout and descriptions,' says Brian Wansink, professor of consumer behaviour at Cornell University in the U.S.

He and his team drew their conclusions after analysing 217 menus and the selections of more than 300 diners.

First, menu layout may be to blame. Any dish that attracts attention - for example listed in bold, highlighted, in a coloured font or boxed out - makes us more likely to order 
that than the item listed next to it.

'But in most cases, 
these are the least healthy items on the menu,' says Professor Wansink.

Second, menus with items described in detail sell better - and lead us to believe they taste better.

Previous research has found that when restaurant
 menu items were re-named to make them more descriptive, they were more popular.

When the seafood filet became 
Succulent Italian Seafood Filet - and red beans and rice became Cajun Red 
Beans and Rice - sales of these items went up by 28 per cent and they were rated 
as tastier, even though the recipe was identical.

Diners were also 
willing to pay an average of 12 per cent more for a menu item with a 
descriptive name.

Often the most unhealthy items are listed in bold, highlighted or boxed out -  to attract attention

'When it comes to what you order for 
dinner, two things matter most: what you see on the menu and how you 
imagine it will taste,' adds Professor Wansink, author of Slim by Design: Mindless Eating Solutions for 
Everyday Life.

So how do you navigate a menu and and avoid order envy or calorie guilt?

'Just ask your server,' he advises. 'Ask "what are your two or three lighter entrées that get the most compliments?' or 'What's the best thing on the menu if a person wants a light dinner?"'

The research will be published this month in the International Journal of Hospitality Management.

Research published in May found restaurant goers who pay more for their meals think the food is tastier than if it is offered for a smaller price.

People who paid $8 instead of $4 for a buffet enjoyed their meal 11 per cent more than those who ate the cheaper food.

Those that paid for the $4 (£2.40) buffet said felt guiltier about loading up their plates and felt that they over ate.

Items described in detail sell better - because we believe they taste better
