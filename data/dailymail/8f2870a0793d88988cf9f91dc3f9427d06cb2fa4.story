Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said the National Crime Agency has details of  suspects but lacks the resources to investigate them all

The Government’s flagship anti-crime agency is failing to investigate up to 25,000 paedophiles suspected of downloading child pornography, Yvette Cooper said today.

The shadow home secretary said the National Crime Agency has details of the suspects but lacks the resources to investigate them all.

She told Labour Party conference in Manchester the lack of action could leave children at risk.

She said: The National Crime Agency has the detail of over 25,000 people suspected of downloading vile abusive images of children online.’

‘But they have only investigated and arrested 660 suspects and they say the police don’t have the capacity to investigate them all.

‘But the police arrest 230,000 people a year for theft. 110,000 for drug offences. Why don’t they have the capacity to investigate 25,000 cases where children may be at risk?

‘The truth is this is not just about capacity it’s about priority.

‘Theresa May says crime is falling and we don’t need as many police. I say crime is changing and we need police and Home Office action to keep our children safe.

Miss Cooper also said Labour would take action to deport thousands more European foreign criminals including violent thugs – who are currently allowed to remain in the country.

At the moment, she said their offences were not deemed serious enough to warrant being kicked out of the country.

Labour would ditch the current requirement for criminals to have received a sentence of two years or more – or 12 months for sexual, violent or drugs crimes – before they can be deported.

Instead, she said, anyone who commits a crime like common assault – and who has lived in the UK for as little as six months – should be considered for automatic removal.

Repeat offenders, such as prolific thieves, could also qualify for immediate removal under the new rules.

It also emerged Labour is to hit thousands of pubs and clubs with a late night opening tax – in a blunt admission of the chaos caused by 24-hour drinking laws.

In 2003 Tony Blair opened the door to round-the-clock drinking with the claim that it would lead to a European style café culture.

Instead, it unleashed a wave of booze-fuelled violence across the country, with police comparing towns and cities to the Wild West.

Miss Cooper said drinking venues wanting to open beyond midnight will be forced to cough up thousands of pounds in the areas with the most alcohol licences.

It will mean pubs, bars and clubs facing an additional charge of up to £4,400 a year if they want to stay open late.

Aides said extending the current Government’s Late Night Levy to 100 areas would raise £12million which would be handed to the police and local authorities to help pay for clean-up costs and put extra officers on the street.

The policy was drawn up by Theresa May in an effort to control drinking excess – but it has been adopted by only a handful of councils.

Labour officials said the levy had proved ‘ineffective’ and only raised ten per cent of the £17million ministers hoped for.

A spokesman said: ‘Theresa May talks a good game, but she isn't finding savings to help the police protect the frontline. We want to see proper enforcement of the Late Night Levy for the top 100 licensing authorities.’

However, the move will leave Labour open to the charge that it is trying to put the ‘genie back in the bottle’ from a problem it created.

Earlier this month, senior police officers made a desperate plea for moderation in drinking as they admitted defeat in tackling Britain’s excessive boozing culture.

The country’s most senior officer responsible for alcohol-related crime called for an end to the attitude which tolerates out-of-control drunkenness as ‘normal’.

Chief Constable Adrian Lee also admitted officers’ efforts to combat booze fuelled yobbishness and violence had ‘barely scratched the surface’ of a problem that is ‘blighting our communities’.

He also called for much tougher action against the alcohol industry, a clampdown on cheap booze and more action to combat criminals with alcohol problems.

Since 2007, the number of town centres and neighbourhoods officially classed as being overrun by problem pubs and bars has rocketed by 150 per cent.
