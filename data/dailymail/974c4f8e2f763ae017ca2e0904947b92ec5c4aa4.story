Bolster support: British Foreign Secretary William Hague has urged support for moderate opponent groups of the Assad regime, and has called on them to create a united front

Moderate opponents of Syria's Assad regime need international support to form a united front if they are to outnumber extremist rebels, the UK's foreign secretary has said.

William Hague has urged moderate opponents to come together to have a 'united position' ahead of the planned Geneva II negotiations next month.

He has warned that while disparate opposition groups remain independent, the strength of extremist groups fighting Assad will grow.

Mr Hague is meeting today with foreign ministers from 11 Western and Arab powers in London, to discuss how they can support the moderate opposition in the run-up to next month's peace conference in Switzerland.

The talks are aimed at putting an end to the brutal war which has ravaged the country and its people since 2011 and created hundreds of thousands of refugees.

The main Western-backed opposition umbrella group, the Syrian National Coalition, is scheduled to meet in the coming weeks to decide whether to take part in the Geneva summit.

One of the most prominent factions within the coalition, the Syrian National Council, has said it has no faith in negotiations with the Assad regime and will not be part of the Geneva process.

However Mr Hague warned that the longer the conflict went on, the more the position of the extremist groups fighting Assad's forces would be strengthened.

'Syrians on all sides now need to make the effort and make the compromises necessary for a peace process to work,' Mr Hague told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.

'The longer this conflict goes on, the more sectarian it becomes, the more extremists are able to take hold. That is why we are making this renewed effort to get a Geneva peace process going.

'I am in no way glossing over or minimising the danger of extremism taking hold. There are people fighting for extreme groups, not necessarily because of extreme views, but because that gives them access to weapons and training and so on - all the more reason why we have to help the moderate opposition in Syria.'

Mr Hague also raised the prospect that Iran - one of Assad's few remaining allies in the region - could take part in the Geneva talks, as long as it was prepared to accept the need for political transition.

'It is important that Iran plays a more constructive role. I have discussed the situation in Syria with the new Iranian foreign minister,' Mr Hague said.

'If they are serious, of course it is helpful to have all outside powers involved in this, but that depends on them coming on a common basis of trying to achieve a peaceful settlement on the basis of a transitional government in Syria.

'That's the position of Russia and 
it's the position of all of us among the West and among Arab nations. It
should be the position of Iran as well.'

The
countries in the 'London 11', the core group of the Friends of Syria, 
are also trying to shift the focus back to the humanitarian crisis after
weeks of international attention on Assad's chemical weapons stockpile.

Representatives of the Syrian National Coalition's leadership are attending, along with ministers from the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt.

Speaking at the end of today's meeting, Mr Hague said: 'The only sustainable way to end this conflict and the suffering of Syrian civilians is through a political transition.

During today's meeting the 11 
attending countries have all agreed to continue to provide 'intensive 
political and practical support' to the Syrian National Coalition, an 
umbrella group for moderate armed forces seeking the overthrow of 
President Bashar Assad, said Mr Hague, who hosted the meeting at the 
Foreign Office.

Mr Hague 
said that, before the talks open in Switzerland, the UK will announce a 
further package of support for the SNC, whose president Ahmed Jarba 
attended today's gathering. British support will include 'substantial' 
non-lethal supplies such as communications, medical and logistical 
equipment, said the Foreign Secretary.

'There
can be no peaceful and political solution in Syria without the 
participation of a moderate opposition,' said Mr Hague. 'We pledged our 
further support to them.'

And he added: 'It is important that we don't abandon them, we keep faith with them.

'Through
the Geneva II process, we will be with them every step of the way, 
giving them the support they need as well as the practical and 
administrative support needed to carry out such a negotiation.'

Mr
Hague said that the Friends of Syria were not making it a precondition 
of the Geneva talks that Assad can have no part in the political future 
of his country, but he made clear that he does not expect there to be a 
place for him in any transitional administration.

'The purpose of our meeting today has been to send a signal of our resolve, our unity and our determination in bringing that about.'

The Friends of Syria group agreed to 'put our united and collective weight behind the UN-led Geneva II process which must lead to establishing by mutual consent a transitional governing body with full executive powers', as set out following earlier talks in the Swiss city in June 2012, said the Foreign Secretary.

'By definition, mutual consent means it can only be agreed with the assent of the SNC, so Assad would play no role in that future government of Syria,' he added.

Mr Hague said: 'Geneva offers the Syrian people the best hope to improve their lives.

'We agreed that we will provide the intensive political and practical support that will be required to give the Geneva II process the best chance of success.'

Mr Hague said that the Assad regime was continuing to use 'disproportionate force' in response to the uprising, much of it directed at civilians.

The regime was 'laying siege to desperate people and presiding over a humanitarian catastrophe, with people under siege and people starving', he said.

He warned of a 'deepening humanitarian disaster' and called on the regime to allow 'full and uninhibited access to people in humanitarian need'.

He acknowledged that the Geneva II process faced 'immense difficulties', but warned that unless moderate forces were supported, the country would be left at the mercy of either Assad or extremist jihadists who have latched onto the conflict.

'The alternative (to Geneva II) is a protracted conflict in which neither side will be able to achieve a military victory over the other,' said Mr Hague.
