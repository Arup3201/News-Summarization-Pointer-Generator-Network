Two Iranian bloggers are to be executed for 'spreading corruption' - as Tehran cracks down on freedom of expression in the run up to its parliamentary elections in March.

Four journalists have also been arrested, prompting the U.S. State Department to urge Iranian officials to 'protect the rights of all its citizens and uphold the rule of law'.

It comes as Israel said the world must act quickly to stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons, and the UN urged the West to resume talks with the pariah state.

And it is two days before Iran's parliament debates whether to stop exports of oil to the European Union, which if approved could start as early as next week.

It would deny the EU a six-month phase-in of the embargo on Iranian oil it agreed on Monday as part of tough new sanctions aimed at forcing the curbing of its nuclear programme.

It followed U.S. action aimed at limiting the country's ability to sell oil, which accounts for 80 per cent of Iran's foreign revenue.

On the arrests and imminent executions, U.S. State Department spokesman Victoria Nuland said: 'We are deeply concerned by the alarming increase in the Iranian regime's efforts to extinguish all forms of free expression and limit its citizens' access to information.'

She said security forces had, in the last two weeks, reportedly arrested journalists Shahram Manouchehri, Sahamedin Bourghani, Parastoo Dokouhaki, and Marzieh Rasouli.

The export of Iranian oil to the European Union could be stopped as early as next week - if Iran's parliament approves a new law on Sunday.

Parliament is pushing for the export ban to deny the EU a six-month phase-in of the embargo on oil that the bloc agreed on Monday.

It is part of a raft of tough new Western sanctions aimed at forcing Iran to curb its nuclear programme.

The EU accounted for 18 per cent of Iranian crude oil sales in the first half of 2011, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. It was Iran's second biggest customer after China.        

MP Moayed Hosseini-Sadr said: 'If the deputies arrive at the conclusion the Iranian oil exports to Europe must be halted, the parliament will not delay a moment (in passing the bill).

'If Iran's oil exports to Europe, which is about 18 per cent (of Iran's oil exports) is halted the Europeans will surely be taken by surprise.

'They will understand the power of Iran and will realise that the Islamic establishment will not succumb to the Europeans' policies.'

And she added: 'Iranian courts confirmed death sentences for bloggers Saeed Malekpour and Vahid Asghari, both of whom were not accorded due process and now face imminent execution on charges of 'spreading corruption.'

All eyes have been focused on Iran in recent weeks as fears grow Iran's enrichment of uranium could lead to the production of weapons-grade material.

Iran insists its atomic programme is only aimed at producing energy and research, but has repeatedly refused to consider giving up its ability to enrich.

To counter this, the West has increased sanctions and warships, including the British frigate HMS Argyll, have sailed into the strategic Strait of Hormuz - the world's busiest oil-route which Iran has threatened to close in response to the sanctions.

Yesterday President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad held out an olive branch to the West when he indicated Iran was ready to revive talks with the West.

With a senior UN nuclear agency team expected to visit the capital tomorrow - the first since a report in November alleged Iran was on the brink of developing a nuclear weapon - he said his country was not 'shunning talks'  and was available for discussion.

But today Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak said the world must quickly stop Iran from reaching the point where even a 'surgical' military strike could not block it from obtaining nuclear weapons.

He said tougher international sanctions were needed against Tehran's oil and banks so that 'we all will know early enough whether the Iranians are ready to give up their nuclear weapons program.'

Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, he said the situation is 'urgent, because the Iranians are deliberately drifting into what we call an immunity zone where practically no surgical operation could block them'.

Israeli computer hackers took a series of key Iranian websites offline, the Jerusalem Post has reported.

English-language Iranian media outlet Press TV, Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education were all targeted.

Two websites belonging to the Islamic Republic's Ministry of Health and Medical Education were also hit yesterday.

The hackers, dubbed the IDF Team, said their actions were a response to a series of attacks on Israeli sites the previous day.

Three other Iranian sites were hacked and their servers altered to display an Israeli flag and anti-Arab text in English.

An internet feud between the two countries started earlier this month when an Arab hacker published tens of thousands of Israeli credit card numbers on the Internet.

To try and defuse tensions, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon today urged a resumption of dialogue between Western powers and Iran on their nuclear dispute Friday.

He also said Tehran must comply with Security Council resolutions and prove conclusively that its nuclear development programme is not directed to making arms.

He said: 'The onus is on Iran. They have to prove themselves that their nuclear development programme is genuinely for peaceful purposes, which they have not done yet.'

Ban expressed concern at the most recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency that strongly suggested that the programme  has a military intent.

In spite of his tough words to Iran, Ban said that dialogue with the 'three-plus-three' - Germany, France and Britain plus Russia, China and the United States - is the path forward.

He added: 'There is no other alternative for addressing this crisis than peaceful... resolution through dialogue.'

Ban noted that there have been a total of five Security Council resolutions so far on the Iranian nuclear program, four calling for sanctions.

As tensions have been on the rise recently, some political leaders in Israel and the United States have been speaking increasingly of the possibility of a military strike to eliminate, or at least slow down, what they allege is a determined effort by Iran to obtain nuclear weapons.
