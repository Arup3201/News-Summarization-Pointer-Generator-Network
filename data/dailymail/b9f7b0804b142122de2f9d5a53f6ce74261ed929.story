Oxford has been overtaken by the London School of Economics in a university league table published today.

The ancient university was forced into third place behind the LSE and arch-rival Cambridge, which took top spot.

A decline in the job prospects of Oxford's graduates contributed to its slide from second place in last year's table.

Third class: Oxford University has been overtaken by the London School of Economics in a new university league table

The prospects of Cambridge leavers suffered a lesser fall while the LSE, which concentrates on a narrower range of subjects, bucked the recession by increasing graduate employment rates.

It is the first time in the 15-year history of the tables, which rank universities on a range of measures including research quality, entry standards, staff-to-student ratios and job prospects, Oxford has been beaten by the LSE.

The tables - part of the Complete University Guide - show how leading universities are toughening up entry requirements to counter rising A-level pass rates.

The average student accepted to Cambridge now achieves the equivalent of almost five A grades.

There are also wide variations in the likelihood of gaining a good degree - a first or 2.1 - depending on the university attended.

Oxford handed good degrees to 91 per cent of honours students and Cambridge 87 per cent, while just 44 per cent of University of East London graduates achieved the distinction.

Despite relatively lowly positions in the tables, some universities gave out large numbers of firsts and 2.1s, with 69 per cent achieving good degrees at Gloucestershire University, which was ranked 74th.

The table, which ranks 116 universities at www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk, also showed stark differences in graduate job prospects.

Across all universities in the list, 63.7 per cent of leavers from the class of 2010 were working in graduate-level jobs or taking further qualifications six months after graduating.

The rest were on the dole or under-employed in jobs unlikely to justify the time and expense of studying.

At Bolton University, the figure was 41.1 per cent and Southampton Solent it was 41.9 per cent.

In contrast, the LSE boasted the highest employment rate, with 87.8 per cent of graduates in good jobs or further study six months later - up from 84.1 per cent last year.

Average employment rates have declined from 68.6 per cent among the class of 2007.

Dr Bernard Kingston, principal author of the guide, said rises and falls in the rankings were driven to a considerable extent by the recession.

Some had adapted to the changing financial climate by focusing sharply on the employability of their graduates.

'The employment market for graduates remains challenging and this is reflected in the rankings. Some universities have been more successful than others in adapting to the new conditions,' he said.

'League tables carry a health warning for good reason and the order at the top of the ranking should be treated with some discretion.

'What is beyond dispute is that all three institutions - Cambridge, the London School of Economics and Oxford - are outstanding in their fields. The LSE's range of disciplines is less broad than Oxford's, and it has a better record for graduate prospects.'

He suggested employers with typically recruit Oxbridge graduates may be struggling, affecting their employment rates.

In separate listings covering 62 subjects, Cambridge takes top place in 30 of the 46 it offers, and is in the top ten for 46.

The LSE is in the top ten for all twelve of the subjects offered and is top for three. Oxford is in the leading 10 universities for all 32 of its subjects, and is placed first in 12.

Across all measures, the top ten universities were Cambridge, LSE, Oxford, Imperial College London, Durham, Warwick, St Andrews, University College London, Lancaster and Bath.

Oxford has previously been beaten in the table by Imperial College London, in 1999 and 2000, when it again took third place.

However, Oxford has taken top spot in the tables more times than Cambridge over the past decade.

The new rankings are a boost for the LSE after it suffered acute embarrassment last year following revelations of extensive links to Colonel Gaddafi's regime.

It accepted a £1.5million donation from Saif Gaddafi, the son of the then Libyan dictator, a year after Saif was awarded a PhD and also agreed to a £2.2million contract with Libya to train its civil service.
