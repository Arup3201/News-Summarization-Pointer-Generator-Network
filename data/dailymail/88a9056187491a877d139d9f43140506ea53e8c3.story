A multi-millionaire estate agent whose 'disastrous' divorce left him unable to afford to buy a home of his own has won a ruling that parts of a family court judgement made last year were 'too favourable' to his ex wife.

Christos Malialis, 59, argued that a £1.45million payout was handed to his ex-wife Elizabeth by an 'unfair' and 'biased' divorce judge and that he had to put their £1.8million six-bedroom former home on the market and move into a rented one-bedroom flat.

The estate agent, who made his fortune from a lettings agency in Hampstead, ironically complained to the Appeal Court that being forced to move into rented accommodation had left him 'nowhere near as comfortable as I have been accustomed to.'

He argued that the award to his ex-wife effectively saw her handed double the share of the marital assets that he received.

Top judges at the Appeal Court ruled that parts of the family court order made last December by Mrs Justice Judith Parker were 'plainly too favourable' to his ex-wife.

The court heard how the husband and wife had lived all their married lives in north London, having been wed for more than 34 years, and had three grown up children when Mrs Malialis began divorce proceedings in 2007.

As well as the estate agency, Selmans Lettings, and the £1.8million former matrimonial home in Finchley, north London, the couple had valuable business and property interests in Liberia and Cyprus.

Mr Malialis, who Mrs Justice Parker said had a 31-year-old Ukrainian girlfriend, told the High Court last year that he was 'shocked' when his wife, aged 59, told him she was ending their marriage.

She levelled accusations that her husband had been 'having relations with a call girl called Nicky' and 'wasted money by gambling in casinos', to the tune of £800,000. Mr Malialis countered by alleging that his wife had had an affair.

Mrs Justice Parker declined to investigate those disputed allegations, but said that Mr Malialis had admitted spending £800,000 in casinos over the years.

Despite being given £1million worth of assets by the divorce judge, Mr Malialis told the Appeal Court that sum was effectively reduced to £648,000 - less than half what his wife received - when his debts and liabilities were taken into account.

He added that most of that sum is tied up in his businesses and, as a result, the former multi-millionaire is now living on just £11,000-a-year.

Mr Malialis bemoaned his 'desperate financial position', saying a delay of 12 months between the divorce hearing and the judge’s decision meant that 'the judgment no longer reflected a fair division of the family fortune.'

He said: 'The judge has awarded twice as much to my former wife which is grossly unfair.

'Most of what the judge has left me is tied up in business, therefore I will never be in a position to buy a home for myself and will be forced to rent accommodation which will be nowhere near as comfortable as what I have been accustomed to.'

'I don’t want to be left without any money and have to stay in the one-bedroom rented flat I’m in at the moment indefinitely.'

He added: 'My family made huge contribution to the matrimonial property. No reasonable judge who had read and understood the facts of the case could have reached the decisions she has reached. Her decision is perverse and completely biased against me.'

Mr Malialis was accused in the family court by his former wife of concealing assets worth £22million.

While Mrs Justice Parker found that there was no evidence that he had 'a £20million lifestyle', she did find that he had 'given a deliberately inaccurate or concocted account' to the court and 'not made full disclosure' in relation to his finances.

But at the Appeal Court, Mr Malialis said that he had no reason to conceal that money from his former wife as he thought they were 'a happily married couple until she shocked me with news that she wanted a divorce.'

Mr Malialis said that he had been a good husband and father for more than 30 years and was not a 'gangster.'

He claimed that, because of the delay between hearing and judgement - due to the judge being taken seriously ill - she had 'forgotten the evidence and didn’t get to grips with the case.'

David Sawtell, for Mrs Malialis - whose lifestyle Mrs Justice Parker found involved 'extravagant personal spending' - said that the judge had not made her decision on the division of wealth out of 'bias' but on the evidence and had not strayed outside her judicial discretion.

Lord Justice Lewison concluded that the way the judge’s decision was framed had unfairly left Mr Malialis solely liable for £330,000 worth of debt on the couple’s property in Cyprus.

The judge also criticised a clause giving the wife control over when Mr Malialis will receive his share of the marital assets, putting him in a position where he could potentially have to wait indefinitely.

Allowing the appeal and altering Mrs Justice Parker's ruling, the judge said: 'The wife has been put in a better position than she would have been.'

The ruling means in effect that the husband’s share of the marital assets has been increased by £165,000 and the period of time he must wait before receiving his portion has been taken out of his wife’s hands.

Lord Justice Thorpe, delivering the court’s main judgement, said: 'The history is unfortunate. The husband has described these proceedings as a disaster and I have some sympathy with that view.

'The trial took place in December 2010, but the judge did not deliver her judgement until December 2011. That is highly unusual in an ancillary relief trial.

'Mr Malialis has asserted that the 12 months between trial and judgement led to a number of errors and erroneous conclusions by the judge.

'I’m not persuaded that the fundamental division order made by the judge resulted from any misdirection or error or otherwise exceeded the generous ambit of her discretion.

Mr Malialis said that the divorce settlement had meant that he had to put the couple's home on this leafy Finchley avenue on the market and rent a one-bedroom flat

'However she wrongly, in my opinion, rejected submissions to limit the period in which the husband might be kept out of his allotted share of the assets.'

The order that the husband bear the £330,000 debt had resuted in 'a windfall' for the wife and the judge said that clause was 'completely unsupportable and not fair.'

Lord Justice Thorpe said: 'We are not happy that she came to the right decision on these points. We allow the appeal to the extent of redrafting aspects of the order which are plainly too favourable to the wife.'

'The husband has succeeded in reducing the shadow of this order on his future.'
