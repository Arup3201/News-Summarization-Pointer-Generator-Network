A council has been accused of painting Britain’s most pointless double yellow lines which measure just 18in - too small to fit a single tyre.

Residents were stunned when the lines appeared in Kingston, south west London, curved around a corner kerb at a three-way junction - but barely big enough for a toy car or a unicycle.

The lines were today criticised by the Institute of Advanced Motorists, which said it appeared to be ‘another example of strict application of regulations failing the common sense test’.

Motorcyclist Oliver English, who 
spotted the lines, said: ‘I think it's stupid and a bit pointless. The 
way they've made the access road look pedestrian is very dangerous for 
pedestrians and motorcyclists.

‘The pavement feels slippery underfoot and it isn't immediately obvious that it is still a road.’

Another
 Kingston resident said: ‘Those lines are just stupid. Not even a 
unicycle could park there. What a waste of time. My daughter’s little 
toy car couldn’t even fit on that tiny bit of kerb.’

The double yellow lines cover a curved area of kerb which is 18in long. The outer yellow line curve is around 30in.

The
 lines were 
spotted behind Metro Bank and the Wheelwright Arms pub on Adam's Walk. 
The yellow lines would fit a standard-size shoebox or carving knife, 
which are both around 15in long.

It could also fit a normal roller blade, which measures slightly less, but 
would be much too short for a skateboard, which measures around 31in on 
average.

Neil Greig from the IAM said: ‘The nice flagstones make it clear you are entering a pedestrian area.

'But since you can paint double yellow lines on tarmac, someone has decided they must - no matter how small a section is.

'The road signs don't seem to be pointing in the right direction to inform any lost drivers, so the area does not provide a lot more clarity over what is legal and what isn't.'

A Kingston Council spokesman told MailOnline: 'The short lines simply mark the end of the "no parking" zone indicated by the lines on either side of the road.

'Until recently they extended along the street which has been newly paved by developers as shared space (pedestrians and vehicles).

'Without the markings at the corner drivers might assume that they could park there, blocking access to the car park and the shared space.'

The shortest double lines in the UK were painted last August between a taxi rank and parking bays in Central London, measuring just over 9in (right).

Westminster Council said it was a mistake made by a contractor, and would be corrected.

Earlier last year, double yellow lines stretching for just 13in were discovered on a street in Cambridge.

Cambridgeshire County Council described the lines as 'common practice'. A spokesman said: 'The yellow lines are at either end of a disabled parking bay and are there to prevent vehicles parked either side from encroaching on the disabled bay'.

Council bosses also laid down 18in double yellow lines on parking bays in Highbury Crescent, north London, in 2007.

In 2012, double yellow lines measuring just 21in also appeared in Canterbury, Kent (right).
