Wealth: The Duke of Westminster is one of the richest people in Britain

The property company owned by the Duke of Westminster has sold off £240million of luxury homes in central London amid fears the capital's house price bubble may be about the burst.

Grosvenor Group said it was cutting its exposure to high-end residential properties after growing concerned that the rate of growth in the London luxury house price market was unsustainable.

The company - which is controlled by Gerard Grosvenor, one of Britain's richest men - says it is branching out from its traditional Mayfair and Belgravia turf, and targeting more affordable rental homes south of the river in Bermondsey.

'I'm more concerned about it [high-end residential pricing] than I was last year,' said Grosvenor Group's Chief 
Executive Mark Preston, who previously called the rate of growth in 
London luxury house prices unsustainable.

'It's
 very much a deliberate initiative on our part to capitalise on prices 
that we think are high,' he added yesterday as the private company 
released its annual report.

Grosvenor said it sold off £240million worth of central London homes, including row of mid-19th century terraces in Belgravia for £115million.

The sales helped Grosvenor Group British and Irish arms triple their profit

The company now intends to reinvest the money in rental homes in more affordable neighbourhoods.

Preston said Grosvenor Group is looking at securing up to three schemes, having already spent £70million on a site in the Bermondsey last year, where it intends to let homes.

'Housing for rent is something that we're beginning to turn our minds to more than we've done in the past,' he said.

'We're recognising that London desperately needs more in that mid-market area where people are literally priced out,' he said.

Gerald Grosvenor, appeared at number eight in Britain's Sunday Times Rich List last year with his £7.8billion fortune.

His London estate, which has been in the Grosvenor family for more than 300 years, comprises hundreds of acres of Mayfair and Belgravia with more than 1,500 homes, shops and offices.

Grosvenor Group also has investments in China, Europe and North America, and a fund management arm.

The company said group profit before tax rose 38 per cent to £506.9million in 2013. The value of its property assets was £5.8billion, unchanged from 2012.

Demand from foreign investors in 
search of a safe haven has pushed London's luxury home prices up by 68 
percent since 2009, compared with a rise of 49 percent in greater London
 as a whole, according to property consultancy Knight Frank.

Many leading analysts have expressed their concern that a property bubble might be forming.
