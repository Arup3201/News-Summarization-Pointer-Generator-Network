Aid groups have warned of a new refugee crisis after half a million Iraqis fled their homes as Al-Qaeda-linked jihadists took over.

The sudden flood of terrified families escaping the fighting in Mosul, Iraq’s second largest city, was described as ‘one of the largest and swiftest mass movements of people in the world in recent memory’.

Neighbouring countries already struggling to look after 2.8 million refugees from the Syrian civil war now face the prospect of a new influx of displaced people desperately seeking a safe haven.

Depending on how long it takes for the Iraqi government to regain control of the territory seized by the militants – if that ever happens – some of the refugees may try to travel on to Europe.

About a quarter of Mosul’s two million residents fled after fighters from the hardline Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) group seized the city this week.

One of the refugees, a labourer named Abed, said: 'Masked men came to our house and they threatened us: "We will get to you." So we fled. They kidnapped other people. They took away some people for interrogation.'

He said ISIS fighters - as well as masked bandits taking advantage of the chaos - were seizing young women for rape or forced marriage.

Many of the refugees headed east into the autonomous region of Kurdistan, which has escaped the worst of the violence that has rocked Iraq since the American and British invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003.

They must have family already living in Kurdistan or a sponsor in order to receive permission to enter the area, according to the International Organisation for Migration.

Some of 
the refugees arrived at checkpoints on foot carrying no belongings and 
with no money or any idea of where they would go next.

Iraqi
 forces reportedly retreated before the terror groups arrived, with one 
soldier telling how his commanding officer ordered him to abandon his 
post.

Shaker Karam, 38, said: 'We didn't even raise our weapons. This isn't even unimaginable - it's madness. We didn't even see a terrorist.'

Gemma Woods, of United Nations refugee agency the UNHCR, said the number of people crossing into Kurdistan had fallen after a panicked surge on Tuesday but thousands continued to flee.

She described seeing a family of 12, including a 70-year-old grandmother, who had travelled on foot for two days from their farm outside of Mosul to escape the ISIS onslaught.

‘Once they reached the checkpoint, they had no inkling of what they might do next. They were out of money and had nowhere to go,’ she said. 

Many arrive at checkpoints already out of money and food having walked for hours through the desert

Aid 
agencies are scrambling to provide food, water, hygiene kits and tents 
to the refugees in the short term, but many are likely to need help for a
 long time to come.

The
 U.N. children's agency, UNICEF, said thousands of displaced, 
particularly children, were sheltering in schools, hospitals and mosques
 outside Mosul, many of them without adequate water, sanitation, or 
shelter. The Red Cross said it had already distributed food and relief 
to 8,000 people near Mosul.

The civil war in Syria, which began in 2011, has resulted in millions of people being forced to flee their homes.

Lebanon is hosting more than 1 million Syrian refugees, Turkey has taken in 780,000, Jordan nearly 600,000, and there are already 225,000 of them in Kurdistan.

Only a relatively small number have claimed asylum in Europe – the figure is estimated at 100,000, of whom about 3,800 have sought refuge in the UK.

But there have been concerns about growing numbers of refugees and other migrants attempting to make the perilous sea crossing from North Africa into the European Union.

Between January and April this year, 
more than 25,000 people tried to cross from Libya into Italy, up from 
just over 1,000 a year earlier. At least a third of the latest arrivals 
were said to be Syrians fleeing their country’s civil war.

Earlier this year Italy warned that up to 600,000 migrants were waiting to make the perilous journey across the Mediterranean from North Africa to Europe.

There are about 4.7 million Kurds living in Iraqi Kurdistan. They mostly belong to the Sunni branch of Islam, which is often bitterly opposed to the rival Shia sect of the late Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein and the Syrian president Bashar Al-Assad.

By zealously manning checkpoints into the autonomous region, Kurdish security forces have managed to prevent the scale of terrorist attacks seen in other parts of Iraq.

But there are fears that the huge influx of refugees from Mosul over recent days - including some soldiers and police who abandoned their weapons and uniforms to flee the ISIS fighters - may also allow militants to enter Kurdistan.
