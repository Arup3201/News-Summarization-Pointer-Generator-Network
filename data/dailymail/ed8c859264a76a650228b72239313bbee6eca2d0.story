A Chicago man who was seriously gored by a bull July 9 during Pamplona's running of the bulls has spoken out from his Spanish hospital bed to detail his terrifying brush with death.

Bill Hillman, who was on his tenth run, writes in the Washington Post that it wasn't his own ineptitude that got him impaled by the bull called Bravito.

Instead, the American author of Fiesta: How to Survive the Bulls of Pamplona claims it was several terrified and inexperienced British runners who inadvertently got him gored.

Gored: Bill Hillman was one of a handful of runners at this year's running of the bulls in Pamplona, Spain who were gored. He suffered a terrible gash to his thigh and remains in the hospital but has written a first-hand account of his brush with death in which he vows to run again

Despite his harrowing experience, and before he was even released from the hospital, Hillman vowed to run again.

'Bravito, meaning "fierce one," pierced his horn through my right thigh and lifted me into the air,' Hillman writes.

Hillman says that he first tripped over the leg of one inexperienced British runner before another knocked him right into Bravito's horns.

After the first goring, Hillman was knocked to the ground and gored once more.

'As I fell to the ground and scuttled toward the barricades on my back, Bravito gored my leg again,' he writes. 'When paramedics pulled me to safety, I saw a racquetball-size hole in my mid-thigh. Blood ran down my leg and flooded my shoe.'

Some of his first thoughts were with his family: 'Go find my wife and tell her I'm sorry,' he told a man.

Given more time to think back on his experience, he wasn't so sorry that he'd leave the tradition behind.

'I will keep running for another chance to lead a Spanish fighting bull up the street. When that happens, I become one with the fiercest, most majestic animal on Earth,' he says.

Hillman, who says he was raised on the wrong side of the tracks by a former gangster father before making his own mistakes, reveals that running from the bulls is therapeutic for him.

'Being gored is part of the bull-running tradition,' he writes. 'The sense of danger — and the excitement of narrowly escaping it — are part of what got me into bull running. Danger has always been a part of my life.'

Dozens of people are injured each year in the 'encierros,' as the runs are called in Spanish, most of them in falls.

Two twenty-something Australians and five Spaniards, in addition to Hillman, were gored in this year's running of the bulls as part of the San Fermin festival.

Fifteen people have died from gorings since record-keeping began in 1924.
