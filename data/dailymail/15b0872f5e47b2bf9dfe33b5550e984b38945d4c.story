This tiny bird looks intrigued as it peers intently at its own reflection in a minibus mirror.

Photographer Tim Withall captured the moment as the common grackle stared in fascination at itself on the Caribbean island of St Lucia.

Mr Withall, 73, was on holiday with friends on the island when he spotted the bird's strange behaviour and reached for his camera.

As well as being found in the Caribbean, the birds also live in large numbers throughout much of North America.

Adults have a long, dark bill, pale yellowish eyes and a long tail with their feathers appearing black with purple, green or blue markings on their head.

They commonly breed in North America, mainly in states east of the Rocky Mountains. The birds create nests that are well-concealed in dense tree foliage - often in pine forests.

They tend to live in colonies, some of which can be quite large. Despite their quirky nature, the 
birds are considered a pest by farmers in some areas because of their 
huge numbers and taste for grain.

There are estimated to be around 73 million commons grackles worldwide. However, a recent study showed the population had declined by about 61 per cent from a high of 190 million.
