It's the place that fairy tales are made.

And now dozens of vintage memorabilia from Disneyland theme parks will showcase the magic of the park when they are auctioned off by Van Eaton Galleries located in Sherman Oaks, California.

Each item tells the incredible story behind the intricate details that went into creating Walt Disney's magical and world-famous theme park.

The unique collection spans over 60-years and includes a first anniversary souvenir magazine, entrance tickets, old photographs of Disney and even his original blueprint for Disneyland.
