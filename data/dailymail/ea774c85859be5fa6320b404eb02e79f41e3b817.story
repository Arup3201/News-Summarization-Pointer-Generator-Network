Sports Direct has apologised after two schoolboys were barred from a store by a security guard who allegedly told them: ‘No Jews, no Jews’.

The sports retailer removed the worker from its outlet in Borehamwood in Hertfordshire after he reportedly told the Year 7 students they could not enter.

Both youngsters attend Yavneh College, a Jewish secondary school in the town, and were wearing their school uniform at the time.

Sports Direct has apologised after two schoolboys were barred from its store in Borehamwood (pictured) by a security guard who told them: ‘No Jews, no Jews’

The guard has since been sacked by the security firm which supplies Sports Direct with workers.

Sports Direct has described the guard’s behaviour as ‘deeply offensive and disrespectful’.

David Rosen, the father of one of the 11-year-old boys, Nathan, told MailOnline: ‘My son was hugely offended, it was his first proper week at the school and he only went in to look at trainers.

‘He was in an anxious state afterwards and clearly upset,’ the lawyer added.

‘I wanted to get the story right and when I went through it with him he said “Daddy there is no question that he said ‘no Jews, no Jews’”.

Mr Rosen, a partner at a London-based law firm, said Sports Direct had behaved ‘impeccably’ and removed the ‘rogue’ security guard.

‘They were swift to apologise and to deal with it,’ he said.

An email sent to him from Simon Bentley, from Sports Direct, and seen by MailOnline, said: 'On behalf of Sports Direct, where I am the Senior Independent Director, I apologise for the distress and trouble that your son, you, and the others involved have suffered.' 

In a further statement, the firm told MailOnline: ‘Our area manager was notified immediately of this incident and took swift action.

‘He personally removed the guard and liaised with the security company which employed the individual. We were subsequently advised that he has been let go by that company.

‘The guard was deeply offensive and disrespectful to the school children. We take pride in the lack of prejudice amongst our trained staff and will not tolerate discrimination of any kind.’
