Wesley Sneijder refused to stand behind one of the opposition mascots before Holland's game with Czech Republic on Tuesday, seemingly because the youngster was too tall.

At 5ft 7in, the Galatasaray midfielder is no giant, and he stood away from his team-mates as the national anthems were sung.

But Sneijder is not alone. Poor old Mathieu Valbuena is only 5 foot 6 inches, so it seemed a little cruel when FIFA assigned the tallest mascot to the Frenchman ahead of the quarter-final against Germany at the World Cup.

The midfielder just about peered above the young boy and he will have felt particularly perturbed to see the commanding midfielder Paul Pogba paired with the smallest mascot.

The Dutch will be hoping qualification for Euro 2016 isn't such a tall order after defeat in their opening game.

New boss Guus Hiddink has endured a tough start after Louis van Gaal's departure for Manchester United, losing 2-0 to Italy last week before the loss in Prague.
