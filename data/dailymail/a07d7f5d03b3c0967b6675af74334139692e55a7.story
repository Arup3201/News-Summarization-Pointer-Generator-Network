Jared Colon, 17, from Hillsborough, New Jersey, was punched by a 16-year-old boy

A mother has spoke of her grief after her 17-year-old son died following a single punch to the head.

Jared Colon, 17, from Hillsborough, New Jersey, was punched by a 16-year-old boy on Saturday at his home and although he was airlifted to hospital he later died from a head injury.  

His mother Beth Colon says his death has been torture beyond belief.

'He really was about helping others, great old soul he was,' she said.

The boy who punched Jared is charged as a juvenile with reckless manslaughter following Jared's death. 

Ms Colon said she was at home when  Jared was hit in the yard and remembers her son saying: 'I'm not going to hit you' to the other boy during their argument.

'I hope these kids learn that they need to resolve their problems peacefully,' she said.

'This violence is ridiculous and it's got to stop. I really hope they are able to learn that lesson from this.'

When Jared was hit it caused bleeding to an area of his brain where doctors could not operate, said Ms Colon, who is a former EMT herself, reported Nj.com. 

His former girlfriend, who was rekindling the romance with Jared, also attended the hospital to say goodbye to him.  

After his death on Tuesday, Ms Colon decided to donate her son's organs.

She said has  received news from the NJ Sharing Network donor organization that Jared's organs have already saved a life.

Ms Colon hopes that one day she might be able to meet the recipients.

She has also created a fund in Jared's name to help children with anger control issues.
