The heartbroken boyfriend of a young woman found dead in the playground of a primary school said she gave him the 'best seven years of his life,' in an emotional tribute.

Blonde Charlotte Christodoulou, 23,was discovered dead at Harlescott Junior School in Shrewsbury, Shropshire.

Two men aged 32 and 39 along with a 31-year-old woman were initially arrested on suspicion of her murder but the charge was later changed to obstructing a coroner.

It is an offence to obstruct a coroner, whether by disposing of a body before they can inquire into the circumstance of the death, or acting to prevent an inquest, the Crown Prosecution Service say.  

Miss Christodoulou's devastated boyfriend Rich Arnold, of Malvern, Worcs., described her as 'the best' and said he did not know what he would do without her.

'She gave me the best 7 years ov my life, she was the best wont find no1 as gud as her.

'Cheers every1 never thought id have this much support means the world makin me stay strong but shill cant believe my babys gone, thanks every1.'

The two men and the woman arrested in connection with Miss Christodoulou's have been released on bail  to return to Shrewsbury Police Station on March 6.

A police spokesman said that her death was no longer being treated as murder following the results of the post mortem examination. 

Harlescott Junior School caters for 277 boys and girls from the age of seven to 11. It received a rating of 'Good' in its most recent Ofsted inspection in July 2013.

Miss Christodoulou, from Walsall, West Midlands, was found just 500 metres from where Julie Mercer, 47, was found dead at business premises on Christmas Eve.
