Her account was quickly verified by Twitter, confirming that the user was indeed THAT Ms Lewinsky.

After firing off the hashtag 'HereWeGo' as her first tweet, Lewinsky quickly got the ball rolling, writing less than an hour later: 'excited (and nervous) to speak to #Under30Summit.' 

Lewinsky was referring to a three-day conference hosted by Forbes Magazine, which opened  in Philadelphia Sunday.

According to the description of the event on Forbes' website, the summit brings together more than 1,000 members of Forbes '30 Under 30' list of 'business leaders and mentors'.

'Lewinsky, who last talked publicly 13 years ago, will offer a singular perspective on what happened to her, and the scourge of harassment in the digital age,' Forbes explained in a statement.  

Besides Ms Lewisnky, who spoke this morning about the 'scourge of harassment in the digital age,' speakers at the summit will include this year's Nobel Peace Prize recipient Malala Yousafzai, musician Questlove and model-turned-philanthropist Petra Nemcova.

As of 17.00pm following her well-received speech in Philadelphia, Ms Lewinsky's Twitter account had 32,000 followers, and counting. 

Vanity Fair, which hired Lewinsky as a contributor this summer, sent out a welcome tweet to the fledgling magazine writer Monday morning. 

Ms Lewinsky became a household name – and the butt of countless late-night jokes - after her affair with President Bill Clinton was leaked to the press in 1998, ultimately resulting in Clinton's impeachment.

After living in relative obscurity for more than a decade, Lewinsky penned an explosive tell-all article for Vanity Fair in May about the Clinton scandal and its destructive aftermath, describing her relationship with the married president as 'consensual.'

'Sure, my boss took advantage of me, but I will always remain firm on this point: it was a consensual relationship. Any ‘abuse’ came in the aftermath, when I was made a scapegoat in order to protect his powerful position,' Lewinsky wrote. 

Claim to fame: Lewinsky, pictured left next to Bill Clinton during her time as a White House intern, became a household name after her affair with the president  was leaked to the press in 1998

'The Clinton administration, the special prosecutor’s minions, the political operatives on both sides of the aisle, and the media were able to brand me. And that brand stuck, in part because it was imbued with power.' 

She has since written several opinion pieces for the publication, including a blog post about cyber-bullying published in July, in which she talked about her reaction to 'Monica' jokes on the hit Netflix series Orange is the New Black.

She also recently weighed in on the ongoing controversy surrounding hacked nude photos of female celebrities, writing in a personal essay that she felt outrage at the gross violation of privacy and compassion for the likes of Kate Upton and Jennifer Lawrence.
