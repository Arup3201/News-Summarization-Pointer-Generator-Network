Stifled by censorship and with western
culture shrouded by an Iron Curtain, Soviet photography can probably be
described as less than avant garde for the majority of the 20th century.

But 'underground' photographers 
working beneath the radar of the communist regime managed to capture 
everyday life through a lens in a more experimental and cutting edge way than the 
authorities would probably have approved of.

And now a collection of more than 800 pictures offering a fascinating and rare glimpse into life in the former Soviet Union is to go under the hammer more than two decades after it was dissolved.

The private American collection, divided
into 156 lots taken between 1959 and 2004, is set to sell at auction for an estimated £891,600 as 
Russian photography continues to become increasingly collectable.

Rare: More than 800 photographs taken in the former Soviet Union by underground photographers will go under the hammer at Sotheby's. Lots include Antanas Sutkas's picture of a blind child dressed as a Young Pioneer, a communist children's organisation, in 1962 (left) and a crouching torso shot taken by Peeter Tooming in 1970

Poignant: This snapshot by Oleg Poleschuk focused on a sailor and his partner watching fireworks in the Soviet Union in the 1970s

Splashing out: This untitled work by Gennadii Bodrov is one of more than 800 which are expected to fetch more than £891,000 at auction at Sotheby's on June 5

Soviets at play: Antanas Sutkus' work On Sunday in the Workers' Living Place is among the pictures in the auction, all taken between 1959 and 2004

In love: This moody image of a young couple was taken by Alexander Sliusarev. Although Soviet art was avant garde in the early part of the regime, it was stifled by censorship during much of the 20th century

Soviet home-photography: Artist Boris Mikhailov retouched this photo of two sailors with a toy bear in a series created from 1971-1985 which is estimated to sell for £5,000-£7,000

From baby-faced marines holding a Teddy bear to colourful pictures of a monkey outside the Kremlin, individual lots are expected to sell for as much as £60,000 in the sale on June 5 at Sotheby's auction house in London.

The collection, called Changing Focus - A Collection of Russian and Eastern European Contemporary Photography, showcases the work of blue-chip Russian and Baltic photographers many of whom exhibited their work underground until the post Soviet era in the 1990s.

The curator of Contemporary Art CIS, Suad Garayeva, said: ‘This unique collection sheds light on the extraordinary and hitherto little-known photographic artwork produced in Russia during the second half of the twentieth century. 

‘The experimental 
snapshots, combining documentation of daily life with a fine-art are 
very different to the images of the region disseminated through Soviet 
propaganda.’

Back in the USSR: The private collection, divided into 156 lots, is estimated to sell at Sotheby's London auction house for over £891,600 and includes a photograph of Mikki, a circus chimpanzee (right), who was trained to take photographs by Vitaliy Komar and Alexander Melamid, the founders of the Moscow Conceptualist movement in the 1970s, and this photograph by Antanas Sutkus (left) which is estimated to sell for £6,000-£8,000 with another print

In Red Square: A series of photographs of Mikki 
the chimpanzee and photos taken himself is set to sell for a huge 
£50,000-£70,000 in a series in which Russian artists Komar and Melamid 
question the role of the human race and the relevance and exclusivity of
artistic talent

Russian influencer: This artwork by Boris Mikhailov is estimated to sell for £5,000-£7,000. Mikhailov has been described as one of the most important artists to have emerged from the former Soviet Union

On the fringe: Photographers from this era worked on the very fringes of official art and culture, exhibiting their works underground in alternative spaces until the 1990s, and experimented with various techniques

Russian 
avant-garde flourished until the 1932 when Stalin’s government took 
control of the arts with a decree that allowed the Communist Party to take control of artists’ unions.

After the Second World War resolutions were passed formally 
denouncing Western cultural influences at the start of the Cold War. 
Several non-conformist art students were among those sent to Siberian 
prison camps.

With Stalin's death in 1953, the arts in the Soviet Union gradually became more liberalized but politics in the 1970s restricted expression and artists had to be employed by the state.

By the 1980s and the collapse of the Soviet Union, galleries were opened and artists had the freedom to create work to their own tastes or that of their patrons. 

Forced to go underground: This photograph by Evgeny Raskopov shows the military force of Stalin's army during the 1930s when his communist government took control of artists' unions

Rare glimpse: The collection is the first of its kind, giving a glimpse into ordinary life in the former Soviet Union. The collection includes this photograph by Igor Moukhin who documented Moscow's punk rock movement in the 1980s at underground gigs

Fascinating insight: The photographs are 'very different to the images of the region disseminated through Soviet propaganda,' curator of Contemporary Art CIS, Suad Garayeva said

The ordinary and avant-garde: Photographers from this era worked on the very fringes of official art and culture, exhibiting their works underground in alternative spaces until the 1990s

For sale: The collection of more than 800 pictures will be one sale at Sotheby's on June 5 and includes this photograph of a boy at a piano by Evgeny Mokhorev from 1967

The works up for auction are 
representative of a variety of trends in photography during the final 
decades of the Soviet regime yet still reflect some of the avant garde 
which the Russians had such an important hand in.

Among the most notable works to go 
under the hammer is Vladimir Kupriyanov's 16 picture collection In 
Memory of Pushkin from 1984. The pictures depict a variety of 
stereotypical Russian women juxtaposed with verses taken from the poetry
of Alexander Pushkin.

It is expected to fetch between £25,000 and £35,000.

Iconic image: This 1965 photo by Antanas Sutkus has graced covers of numerous publications after the Lithuanian photographer was asked to chronicle writer Jean-Paul Sartre's high profile official trip to the country

Daily life: Photographer Aleksandras Macijauskas is one of Lithuania's best-known photographers and travelled to the remotest villages in his country to document daily life including this photo from a series called In the Market

Working 'underground': Estimates for individual lots range from £1,200 to £60,000, the exhibition at London auction house Sotheby’s showcases the work of blue-chip Russian and Baltic artist-photographers

Vitaliy Komar and Alexander Melamid, 
both founding members of the Moscow Conceptualist movement of the 1970s,
trained Mikki the chimpanzee, a popular performer at the Moscow Circus,
to take photographs at various Russian landmarks.

The blurry shots he took of places 
like Red Square are among those for sale with the pair's Our Moscow 
Through The Eyes Of Mikki collection expected to sell for between 
£50,000 and £70,000.

Jo Vickery, senior director and head 
of Sotheby's Russian Art Department in London, said: 'This auction marks
a significant step in the market for Russian and Eastern-European 
contemporary photography. It reflects the mounting international 
appetite for such works, and reveals the radical critical reassessment 
of the genre which has taken place in recent years.'

Beauty in motion: This 1964 photo taken by Isi Trapido is estimated to sell for £2,000-£3,000

Collectables: Russian photography has become increasingly popular during recent years thanks to collections such as these which are being seen more and more
