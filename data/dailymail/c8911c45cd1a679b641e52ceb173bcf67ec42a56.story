QPR defender Anton Ferdinand sparked a row today as he snubbed Chelsea's John Terry and Ashley Cole at the pre-match handshake at the Barclays Premier League clash.

It was the first time that Ferdinand and Terry have met on a football field since the former England captain's race trial in July.

Terry was found not guilty of using a racial slur against Ferdinand in the corresponding fixture last October, but remains the subject of a Football Association investigation over charges that he denies.

The QPR defender rejected the offer of his two rivals' outstretched hands before the game at Loftus Road.

No other QPR player appeared to ignore Terry or Cole, who testified as a
character witness for his England team-mate at the trial.

Terry, who remains the subject of a 
Football Association investigation over the charges that he denies, had 
been a doubt for the Loftus Road clash but recovered from an ankle injury sustained on England duty.

QPR fans then started singing derogatory chants at the Chelsea captain and Cole, who were jeered every time they touched the ball during the London derby.

The handshakes had been abandoned in advance of the previous two encounters between the clubs.

QPR manager Mark Hughes branded the handshake row 'ridiculous' on Friday and called for the ritual to be axed.

'Is this the best way to do it? I think it’s open to debate,' he said. 'Maybe something could be done after the match.

'The lead-up to the game has been ridiculous and everyone has been focusing on this one moment just prior to the game.

'When I saw the list of questions I 
was likely going to answer (at his press conference) there was nine on 
the handshake and one on Hillsborough. Ridiculous.'

Terry was cleared of a racially aggravated public order offence during the clash with QPR which was broadcast to millions of people.

A court heard the 31-year-old allegedly called  Ferdinand a 'f****** black c***'.

The prosecution said he his words came in response to taunts about his alleged affair with a team-mate's ex-girlfriend.

Wesminster magistrates were told that Terry told Ferdinand to 'f*** off" and also called him a "f****** k*******' as the pair exchanged insults.

It is not the first time Terry has been involved in a handshake row. Wayne Bridge snubbed the former England captain following allegations of an affair with the Manchester City defender's former partner.

And Luis Suarez refused Manchester United's Patrice Evra's offer of a handshake, despite the Liverpool forward being found guilty by the Football Association of racially abusing him earlier in the season.
