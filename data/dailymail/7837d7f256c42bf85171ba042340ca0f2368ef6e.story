A married woman has outlined her decision to stop wearing leggings or 'thin, form-fitting yoga pants' in public, for fear of 'enticing' men.

'[Wearing leggings] creates a stronger attraction for a man to look at a woman’s body and may cause them to think lustful thoughts,' writes Veronica Partridge, a 25-year-old Christian mother-of-one based in Bend, Oregon, on her namesake blog.

Mrs Partridge came to this decision after her husband of five years, motivational speaker Dale Partridge, admitted it was 'hard' not to look at other woman when they wore yoga pants.

According to Mrs Partridge, who is undeniably blessed in the looks department, it's a conviction that has been 'weighing heavy' on her heart for months.

'I tried ignoring it for as long as I could,' she writes before describing that God 'changed her heart.'

She later asked her husband whether it was possible that leggings could cause a man other than him to 'think lustfully' about her body.

'I appreciated his honesty when he told me, “Yeah, when I walk into a place and there are women wearing yoga pants everywhere, it’s hard to not look. I don’t, but it’s not easy”.'

Mrs Partridge surmises that if Dale, who 'loves, honors and respects' her, finds it difficult to 'keep his eyes focused ahead' then perhaps it is even harder for a man with less 'self-control.'

She concludes: 'The only time I feel (for myself) it is acceptable to wear them, is if I am in the comfort of my own home or if I am wearing a shirt long enough to cover my rear end.'

Mrs Partridge concedes that her new dress code does make it difficult for her to find an outfit sometimes, but claims: 'My conscience is clear and I feel I am honoring God and my husband.'

Unsurprisingly, the post sparked fierce debate in the comments section.

Many users who identified themselves as female Christians asked whether Mrs Partridge would also forgo wearing a swimsuit on the beach, and many likened her vows to 'radical Islam.'

One wrote: 'Or you know, we could all just wear giant bags over our bodies with only our eyes exposed,' while another suggested, 'Maybe a burqa would make you feel more comfortable.'

Another commenter criticized the 'shame' that gets projected onto females and the tendency to 'make women feel like they are responsible for men's sexual thoughts.'

One man however, who describes himself as a 'young, single, concerned American' agreed with Mrs Partridge wholeheartedly.

'You might as well be wearing nothing,' he wrote of leggings, arguing that they were blatantly designed to 'draw attention' rather than for 'comfort.'

'Remember,' he offers. 'Even Jesus said that a married man lusting after another woman has committed Adultery just by having that thought.' 

Interestingly, in a separate blog post dated November 6 2013, Mrs Partridge writes candidly about her and Dale's early-marriage struggles, and later blamed her own jealously.

OK for men? Two years ago, Mrs Partridge posted this image of her husband topless, captioned, 'This is MY husband! (7 years ago) Sexy right?!' 

Describing one 'chaotic' car ride, she writes: 'All of a sudden, my husband just lost it! I was dumbfounded.

'Never have I seen that side of him. I immediately shut my mouth and couldn’t do anything but cry the rest of our drive home.'

After then attending marriage counseling at the couple's church, Mrs Partridge wrote: 

'I learned that most of the arguments initiated by myself were because of my ridiculous jealousy, being unreasonable, and passive aggression.'

Mrs Partridge insists that her recent blog post and her decision to eschew wearing leggings in public is a personal one.

'I am in NO WAY trying to tell people what they can and cannot wear,' she writes. 'What you wear is entirely your own choice.'
