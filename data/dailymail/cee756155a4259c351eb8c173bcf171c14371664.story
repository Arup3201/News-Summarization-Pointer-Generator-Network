A pair of conjoined twins born sharing a liver have been successfully separated in southwest China after an eight-hour operation.

The twin sisters were born on October 30 last year joined at the stomach, but doctors said the operation had been success in what was a first for the city of Kunming, the capital of China's Yunnan Province. 

The girls' father Chen Fubin said his daughters were sent to the capital's hospital immediately after their birth in their hometown of Quijing City.

He said: 'We felt very sad when we saw them. We didn't expect them to be conjoined. We were worried about their health,' China Central Television reported.

Doctors said administering the anesthesia was particularly difficult given their light weight, but little blood was lost and the two were recovering well in an intensive care unit.

Last week, two ten-month-old conjoined baby girls from Texas survived a world-first operation to separate them.

Knatalye Hope and Adeline Faith Mata shared the same chest wall, lungs, pericardial sac (the lining of the heart), diaphragm, liver, intestines, colon and pelvis.

A team of more than 26 clinicians, including 12 surgeons, six anesthesiologists and eight surgical nurses at the Texas Children's Hospital operated to separate the girls.

The 26-hour surgery was the first time twins conjoined at the chest and abdomen in this way had been successfully separated.

Earlier this week it was also announced a pair of conjoined baby boys are expected to make a full recovery after being successfully separated in a nine-hour operation in Saudi Arabia.

A team of surgeons led by the country's former Health Minister Dr. Abdullah Al-Rabeeah completed the difficult procedure in Riyadh.

The twins, who were from the Republic of Yemen, were taken to Saudi Arabia to be operated on at the King Abdulaziz Medical City in the capital.

During preliminary tests, the medical team discovered that the twins shared organs, including the intestines.

The separation was the 35th performed on Siamese twins in the kingdom since 1990 on cases from more than 18 countries, including the Sudan, Yemen, Egypt, Malaysia, Philippines, Poland, Morocco and Iraq.

Saudi Arabia has a team of top surgeons in the separation of conjoined twins - with 30 successful cases over the past two decades.
