For when one layer simply isn't enough, Pillsbury has posted a recipe for a triple-decker pepperoni pizza cake.

The preparation time for the decadent creation is an hour and ten minutes.

The recipe, which makes six servings, requires just five ingredients: Pillsbury refrigerated classic pizza crust, Muir Glen organic pizza sauce, shredded mozzarella cheese, pepperoni and butter.

A circular cake pan with tall sides is also required. After cutting the dough into five circles the size of the pan, you can begin adding each layer of meat and cheese before baking the cake for 20 to 25 minutes.

Shawn Syphus, the recipe's author, inists that it's 'super easy' to make, advising: 'Don’t push this recipe off as too difficult, or too time consuming.'

While no nutritional information is listed for the pizza cake, Pillsbury's pizza crust is 960 calories per can, according to the brand's website. 

MailOnline used MyFitnessPal to add up the ingredients' calories, and estimated that the entire pizza cake contains 3,818 calories, while there are 636 in each slice.

Layer by layer: First you cut the dough into five circles the size and add one to the bottom of a tall circular pan

The meaty part: Then you keep adding layers of dough, pepperoni and cheese until reaching the top of the pan

However, Pillsbury isn't the first to come up with the mouth-watering concept.

The food site So Good Blog published a very similar recipe back in April. 

In April, Canadian chain Boston Pizza asked customers to vote in an online poll on whether to add pizza cake to its summer menu.

The multi-layered treat won first place in the restaurants Pizza Game Changers campaign.

Other contenders included a box of tiny pizza mints, a gas-powered pizza cutter, pizza clippers, pizza car fresheners, a shirt with a triangle-shaped pocket for holding a slice of pizza and a pizza beardkin – a beard-shaped napkin with a hole for one’s mouth that allows for mess-free pizza eating.
