Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal will head straight into his new Old Trafford role after the World Cup and his settling-in period has been made more straightforward after he bought a house in nearby Cheshire. 

While Van Gaal has been away at the World Cup in Brazil managing his native Holland, he has left domestic matters in the hands of his wife Truus, who has selected a property for the family.

Van Gaal’s wife has been spotted house-hunting in the Alderley Edge area in recent weeks and Sportsmail understands that the Van Gaals’ put down a deposit on a property around ten days ago.

The new United boss will move into the plush area in Cheshire that is known as the Golden Triangle, with Hale, Wilmslow and Alderley Edge among the most exclusive and glamorous areas in the north-west. Van Gaal will be close by to star players such as Wayne Rooney, David De Gea and Juan Mata.

The Dutchman is determined to have no distractions once he begins his new job at Old Trafford and this news follows Sportsmail’s revelation on Sunday that Van Gaal has decided not to take a holiday following the World Cup.

Instead, he will go into his role at Old Trafford within just a couple of days.

The Dutchman has been in charge of the Netherlands for the World Cup in Brazil but despite the intense nature of the tournament, it is understood that Van Gaal has informed United officials that he will not require a break, even if Holland reach the final of the competition on July 13. 

United fly out to the United States for their pre-season tour on July 17 but Van Gaal would not return to Europe until July 15 if his team were to compete in the final of the World Cup in Brazil.

It could mean that the Dutchman has less than 48 hours between leaving South America and assuming full responsibilities as manager of Manchester United.

There is also the possibility that United will present Louis van Gaal in a press conference before the club head off to the USA for glamour games against LA Galaxy, Roma, Inter and Real Madrid, meaning that the 62-year-old could have an exhausting schedule lying in wait.

It is also expected that United will have a host of commercial events in store once they land in the USA.

Van Gaal, meanwhile, has been in constant discussions with executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward during his involvement with the World Cup and he is understood to be delighted with the progress United have made in the transfer window, after the club this week sealed the signings of midfielder Ander Herrera and defender Luke Shaw.

Both new players will join up with the squad on the tour of America while players who exited the World Cup in the group stages, including Danny Welbeck, Phil Jones, Chris Smalling, Wayne Rooney, Juan Mata, David De Gea and Shinji Kagawa will be expected to be available to play from the second game of the tour.

Van Gaal had initially expected to be without the club’s England stars for the majority of the trip as it is normal practice for World Cup players to be given a four-week break following their elimination from the tournament.

However, Van Gaal will now have a chance to meet the majority of his squad far earlier as the players have been informed that they must be ready to play against Roma in the second game of the tour in Denver on July 26.

Despite Holland’s involvement in the latter stages of the World Cup, striker Robin van Persie is understood to be keen to head out on the pre-season tour to be alongside close ally Van Gaal.

However, it is expected that he will be encouraged to take a proper break to recharge his batteries ahead of the new season.

Upon returning to Manchester, Van Gaal’s first port of call will be to have discussions with new assistant manager Ryan Giggs as the pair look to shape their squad as they embark on their debut campaign in charge at Old Trafford.
