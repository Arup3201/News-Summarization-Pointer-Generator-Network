Facebook billionaire Mark Zuckerberg is planning his next start-up – but this time, in politics.

The 28-year-old wunderkind is entering the partisan arena with wide-reaching plans for education and immigration reform, among other things in a Silicon Valley SuperPAC, sources said.

The move is unusual in that the CEO of Facebook has traditionally avoided large partisan contributions, instead donating to community-based charities.

The tech guru is exploring a SuperPAC to push the issues and has already poured in millions of his personal fortune, the San Francisco Chronicle originally reported.

The independent expenditure group is expected to focus mainly on immigration reform, and making it easier for international talent to work in the U.S.

According to Politico, the group also seeks to support reform that would allow undocumented immigrants achieve a path to American citizenship, a move that they believe supports a robust economy and strengthens the nation.

Sources told the Chronicle that the independent expenditure group was initially formed to Zuckerberg’s former Harvard roommate, Joe Green.

Green declined comment because the group is in early stages.

Raising funds: Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, held a fundraiser for Gov Christie at their $7million home in Palo Alto last month

Earlier this month, Zuckerberg and other notable Silicon Valley players met with members of Congress and the president to discuss a ‘more open and flexible’ immigration system to allow the best and the brightest in the tech industry to work on America’s shores.

According to the Chronicle, industry heavyweights included Google CEO Eric Schmidt as well as Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer.

A source told Politico that the move isn’t necessarily driven by Facebook. ‘Leaders are coming together on a broader agenda,’ they said.

Facebook did not immediately respond to MailOnline’s request for comment.

In 2011, Zuckerberg donated $100million to help improve public schools in Newark, New Jersey, sparking a close-knit relationship with the state’s governor, Chris Christie.

And last month, Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, hosted the Republican governor at their Palo Alto home for a fundraiser with many of Silicon Valley’s tech darlings, a move that stirred controversy among Democrats.

In the wake of Hurricane Sandy, Christie’s popularity skyrocketed, with an all-time high approval rating of 74 percent among voters. The high numbers, as well as the high-profile fundraiser, have ignited rumors that Christie has his eye on the White House.

Radio silence: Until now, Zuckerberg has been fairly reserved in his political spending, only donating $5,000 twice to Facebook's political action committee

In the past, Zuckerberg, who is worth $13.3billion as of this month, has not been vocal about his political believes.

The Dobbs Ferry, New York native attended Harvard University, only to drop out when Facebook began taking off.

According to the Chronicle, Zuckerberg will have Republican consulants Jon Lerner and Rob Jesmer on board, as well as former press secretary Joe Lockhart, who worked under former president Bill Clinton.
