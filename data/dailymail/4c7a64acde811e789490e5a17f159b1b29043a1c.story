A supercentenarian recognized as the oldest man in the U.S. has died at 110 years and 338 days.

Conrad Johnson from Rockford, Illinois, passed away on Tuesday after his health deteriorated following a stroke back in April.

He previously told WTVD TV that his secret to long life was exercising every day, eating oatmeal for breakfast, daily prayers and early nights.

Socializing was also important to him and earned a reputation for being quite the ladies' man.

Johnson was born in Sweden and moved from his family farm to the U.S. at 19 years old where he pursued a career in carpentry.

He never had children and was widowed twice. 

His first wife died in 1988 after suffering from Parkinson's disease while his second wife lost a battle with cancer in 2002.

However, being one of ten children he had lots of nephews and nieces. His only survivor is a nephew, Edward Johnson of New Brunswick, New Jersey.

The reverend Jane McChesney of the Tabor Lutheran Church in Illinois knew Johnson well. He was part of the congregation since the Thirties.

She described him as smart, good-humored, 'a self-made man' and 'very giving.'

The senior lived in his own home in Rockford until he was 102, according to the Rockford Register Star.

He then moved to a retirement community but was moved to a nursing home this spring after suffering a stroke.

He was set to turn 111 on January 19. Reverend McChesney said he appeared in good health until earlier this year.

She said he lost some of his 'vigor' and started using a walker for the first time.

Robert Young, a Senior database administrator for the national Gerontology Research Group, says Johnson was the oldest verified American man.

Several women are older. 

Johnson was born before Albert Einstein introduced his theory of relativity and he saw 19 U.S. presidents take office.

Title-holder: The oldest man in the world is Sakari Momoi from  Japan, who is set to turn 112 in 2015

He took the title of 'oldest U.S. man' after Alexander Imich passed away at his home in Manhattan, New York, on June 8 2014 aged 111 years and 124 days. 

It's thought James Richardson of Phoenix City, Alabama, who was born on January 2 1904 could be the new title-holder. 

The oldest man in the world is Sakari Momoi from Saitama City, Japan, who is set to turn 112 on February 5, 2015.

Funeral arrangements are currently pending for Johnson.
