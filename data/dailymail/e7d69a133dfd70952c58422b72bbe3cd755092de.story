An Indianapolis woman has sued the city's police department, contending that an order to remove an 'Unmarked Police Car' bumper sticker from her minivan violated her rights to free speech.

Pamela Konchinsky, 56, filed a lawsuit through the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana on Friday, arguing that Indianapolis police did not have the right to question and make demands of her.

Officers pulled over the mother-of-two's vehicle earlier this month and violated her freedom of speech, the group representing her said on Monday.

'We 
contend that the police officers who detained and interrogated our 
client without legal grounds to do so violated her constitutional 
rights,' ACLU attorney Kelly Eskew said in a statement.

'The promise of our Constitution is that these lines cannot be crossed.'

Konchinsky
 was on her way to work on June 17 when she was pulled over in Downtown 
Indianapolis and and told: 'With that bumper sticker, someone could 
think you're impersonating a police officer', The Indy Star reported.

Konchinsky works three jobs and has two children - one an adult, and one a child in school.

She
 was late for work on the day of the incident and her lawsuit is seeking
 unspecified damages, payment for lost wages and legal costs.

According to the complaint, Indianapolis police officers told Konchinsky the bumper sticker would make people think she was impersonating a police officer and could get her shot, before demanding that she remove it from her rear window.

The bumper stickers are sold for $2.50 online and are intended as a joke.

The suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana.

Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department spokesman Lieutenant Chris Bailey said the department did not comment on pending litigation.
