Dr Hugh Blaise O'Neill who was jailed for 12 years for 'terrifying' sexual abuse against two teenage girls 

A former police surgeon has been jailed for 12 years after he robbed two teenage girls of their childhood by subjecting them to 'terrifying' sexual abuse.

Dr Hugh Blaise O'Neill, 61, from Tasburgh in Norfolk admitted raping and sexually assaulting the two children after appearing at Norwich Crown Court.

The court heard how his crimes represented a 'fall from grace' for a respected member of the community who worked for Norfolk Police in the 1980s and as a GP for 37 years.

However, his offending is not linked to his role as a doctor.

Prosecutor Andrew Jackson said the two victims were under the age of 14 at the time of the attacks and came to light after one of them was prompted to contact police as a result of media coverage of high profile sexual abuse cases.

One of the vicitms, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said in a statement read to the court that she could no longer trust others and she regarded the abuse as her 'terrible secret'.

She added: 'It was the most terrifying experience of my life.

'There is not one evening that goes by when I don't relive what he did to me before going to sleep at night.'

Meanwhile the other victim said she felt like she had been terrorised and had slept with a knife under her pillow in order to feel safe.

She added: 'When I think about my childhood, I feel as though it was taken away from me.'

O'Neill pleaded guilty to two counts of rape and once count of gross indecency against one victim, and two counts of gross indecency against a second victim.

Sentencing him to 12 years in prison, Judge Anthony Bate said: 'These offences reflect sustained sexual abuse. 

'The enduring impact of that violation, is movingly and poignantly described in the victim's statement.

'It was a breach of trust of the utmost gravity.

You are now a broken man - your disgrace is complete.'

Michael Clare, mitigating, accepted that O’Neill’s behaviour represented a breach of trust.

He said that in every other aspect of his life, O’Neill was a law abiding, caring and 'outstanding' man.

He added: 'The higher you have risen in life, the harder the fall from grace.

'He is experiencing that now: one week ago his wife told him that their marriage is over.

'He is at about the lowest ebb he has ever been.'

O’Neill has also been suspended from his duties by local NHS managers.
