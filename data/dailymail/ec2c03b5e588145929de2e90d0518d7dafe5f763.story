Prince William is more popular than the Queen with more people expressing a 'favourable' view of the young royal than his grandmother.

But both are significantly more popular than the UK's best-known politicians including the Prime Minister David Cameron.

According to a new poll, 68 per cent of people had a positive opinion of the Duke of Cambridge compared to 63 per cent who felt the same about the Queen.

The Prince of Wales lagged well behind his son and mother with 43 per cent of those surveyed holding him in high regard but he still enjoyed a better rating than any of the figures at Westminster.

Prime Minister David Cameron is only popular among 28 per cent of people, with him slightly edging ahead of Ukip's Nigel Farage, whose approval rating was 26 per cent.

London mayor Boris Johnson is the most popular British politician with 41 per cent of those polled expressing a favourable view.

But less than one in five said they saw Labour leader Ed Miliband in a good light - fewer than Foreign Secretary William Hague and on a par with Chancellor George Osborne.

After their recent public spat, Theresa May retains more public favour at 16 per cent than Michael Gove, with the Education Secretary also attracting significantly more dislikes with only nine per cent viewing him favourably.

Reflecting his party's woeful poll showings, Liberal Democrat Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg is admired by only 13 per cent of people.

Meanwhile the poll also showed a narrowing of Labour's lead over the Tories to 34 per cent versus 32 per cent - the smallest gap for almost two-and-a-half years in ComRes online research.

Ukip and the Liberal Democrats shed a point each to stand at 18 per cent and seven per cent.

The research also showed that religious freedom was named by only 12 per cent of voters as one of the most important 'British values' after Mr Gove pledged they would be promoted in the classroom in the wake of the Trojan Horse controversy.

The most chosen important British value was freedom of speech at 48 per cent, followed by respect for the rule of law, fairness, tolerance, a sense of humour, equality, politeness, political freedom and responsibility.

Aspiration - often cited by political leaders as a fundamental British value - was picked by only three per cent.

The ComRes poll, commissioned by the Sunday Mirror and Independent on Sunday interviewed 2,034 British adults.
