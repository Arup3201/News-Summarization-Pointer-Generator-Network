It's one of the most glamorous - but undoubtedly one of the most hit-and-miss - nights on the fashion calendar.

And leading the worst-dressed list at the Met Ball in New York on Monday was pop star Rita Ora, with actresses Kate Upton and Katie Holmes hot on her gold gladiator-style heels.

Rita wore a 
champagne-coloured dress with puffy lace skirt - split to the waist to expose her underwear - by Donna Karen Atelier, paired with questionable thigh-high, 
golden strappy heels.

What an outfit! Rita Ora earns her place on the worst-dressed lists in this daring Donna Karan gown at the Met Ball on Monday

The 23-year-old RIP singer tried to 
rectify the situation when she realised her underwear was on show, but by then it was
 far too late to spare her blushes.

Designer Donna Karan describes the gown as an, 'antiqued matte gold sequined silk tulle gown with an asymmetrical sculpted train.' However, most were unconvinced by the ensemble.

Her footwear - custom Casadei embroidered with antique gold sequins - looked out of place and over-the-top on her busy outfit.

Meanwhile, Kate Upton's saloon waitress look - a dress by Dolce & Gabbana - had Twitter users aghast.

Style bloggers Mamamia Style asked: 'We need to talk about Kate Upton's milkmaid by way of the saloon.'

Kate, who is currently on the cover of UK Vogue,
 is known for her voluptuous figure.

But it was flanked by the mountain of material that made up her outfit, not to mention the bizarre frills and corset which featured on the black lace dress.

The
 Met Ball, formally called the Costume Institute Gala, is an annual 
fundraising gala for the benefit of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's 
Costume Institute, and is renowned for attracting fashion's most famous faces.

However, in spite of it's reputation as the most stylish night of the year, some guests still manage to get it wrong.

Katie Holmes, usually preened to perfection, looked more like Belle from Disney's Beauty And The Beast, in a
 huge yellow Marchesa gown.

The
 actress looked disheveled in the mustard-coloured dress, in which the 
puffy shoulders fell down onto her slim shoulders.

At least she ditched The Beast! Katie Holmes' attempt to be the Belle of the Met Gala, in Disney-style yellow Marchesa, falls flat

What was she thinking? Katie Holmes' dress seemed too big as it fell down around her slender frame

Also doing the walk 
of shame on the red carpet was Lena Dunham in Giambattista Valli, Amanda Peet in Marc Jacobs and Zoe Saldana, whose Michael Kors taffeta sculpted 
skirt drowned her pretty figure.

Shailene Woodley was another contender for the worst-dressed star to grace the Met's red carpet.

The Divergent actress, 22, wore an ill-fitting Rodarte dress which fell unflatteringly down the shoulders and aged her dramatically.

Kirsten Dunst, meanwhile wore a bizarre dress, also by Rodarte, with the Death Star from Return Of The Jedi printed upon it.

Keeping things quirky on the carpet were
 Lily Allen in a overly frilly Chanel Couture dress and Chloe 
Sevigny in an odd Kenzo gown.

Kristen Stewart wore Chanel to the star-studded event, but even the French design powerhouse didn't suit the pretty actress.

Her dress was far too busy for the usually elegant star, with feathers and a chiffon skirt paired with a heavily sequined long-sleeved top.

Also on the worst dressed list were usually on-trend Solange Knowles, actress Brie Larson, model Karolina Kurkova and Julie Macklowe.

Karolina wore an over-the-top Marchesa ballgown from the outdated spring/summer 2011 collection, paired with a reported $1 million worth of Harry Winston diamonds.

21 Jump Street actress Brie, 24, wore enviable designer Prada, though the outfit was bizarre: garish gold trousers and an oversized tunic which made her look more like a Christmas decoration than a guest at a high fashion event.

Julie, meanwhile, an American investor, former hedge fund manager, and socialite, wore a bright yellow dress which clashed heavily with her pale skin and stark two-tone hair scraped back.

On the other end of the fashion spectrum however, were Blake Lively, Emma Stone, Cara Delevingne and Beyonce, who looked sensational in their outfits.

Blake, 26, was reminiscent of a 1940s film starlet as she wore a stunning silk chiffon blush mermaid gown, custom-designed by the Italian fashion house, Gucci, for which she is a model.

The Gucci Premiere gown was embroidered with rose gold paillettes, featured a plunging neckline, whilst her blonde tresses were curled and swept to the side.

The Gossip Girl actress arrived with her equally gorgeous Hollywood husband, Ryan Reynolds, 37.

His midnight blue velvet one-button tuxedo was also by Gucci, a brand for which he too is a model.

The Amazing Spiderman actress Emma Stone, 25, who arrived with Spiderman himself - her boyfriend Andrew Garfield, 30 - looked adorable in a pink Thakoon dress, Miu Miu shoes, Tod‘s clutch, and Graziela Gems and EF Collection jewellery.

Beyonce, who of course attended the fashion event with husband Jay Z, looked elegant in a black Givenchy gown

Diane Kruger, 37, was another hit on the red carpet, as her shimmering pale blue Jason Wu for Hugo Boss dress fitted her perfectly.

She was of course accompanied by her boyfriend, fellow actor, Joshua Jackson, 35.

The couple are known for their shared love of fashion and paired down style that is always bang on trend. Once again, they did not disappoint.

Jessica Alba, 33, looked gorgeous, too, in an elegant gold dress by Diane von Furstenberg, with a matching clutch.

Michelle Williams was another best-dressed, as the 33-year-old actress wore a dress from Nicolas Ghesquière’s debut Louis Vuitton collection.

The cut of the dress suited her perfectly, showing off her enviable legs and complimenting her pale but pretty skin tone.
