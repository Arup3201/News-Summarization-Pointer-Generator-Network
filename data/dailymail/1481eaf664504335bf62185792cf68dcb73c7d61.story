And so it came to pass that Martha Levinson and Dowager Countess Violet finally came face to face at Downton Abbey. As Lady Mary and Matthew Crawley’s wedding loomed, the long-awaited encounters of the two grande dames did not disappoint.

Across the dinner table or in a church pew, they were like a pair of grizzled gunslingers, trading acid quips instead of bullets. Not so painful perhaps, but almost as deadly.

‘Oh dear,’ cried Martha, pouncing on Maggie Smith’s Violet in the hallway and gleefully eyeing up her wrinkles. ‘The war has made old women of us both.’

Making an entrance: Shirley Maclaine as Martha Levinson in the third series of Downton Abbey, set in 1920

‘Oh no,’ Violet begged to differ. ‘I stay out of the sun.’

In the delirious new series of Downton Abbey, which began last night, Martha (Shirley MacLaine) came crunching down the drive at last. She was wearing jazz shoes, what appeared to be a fur papoose and a frozen expression on her face. We’d better get to like it — it’s the only one she’s got.

As Lady Grantham’s American mother, Martha’s job is to patronise the English and their stuffy ways at every opportooonity. Hey, someone has to show these squares that the egalitarian delights of the New World, with its lack of pretence and stifling tradition, are the way forward.

‘Tradition!’ she sneers regularly, in the finest showbiz tradition.

She insists upon boiled water and goat’s milk at all times, but I must say Shirley’s little dolly face seems slightly out of place amid the lush velvets and sprinkling of aristocratic Downton dust. Did they even have Botox and crafty pearly highlighter in them days?

Shirl also seems to be acting to a different beat, but maybe she gets her stage directions on a time loop straight from Cecil B. DeMille himself? Who can say, but she is certainly a delicious target for Violet to be horrid about.

Aid: Alfred, played by Matt Milne, is seen helping Martha out of a vehicle in the sumptuous setting

‘When I am with her, I am reminded of the virtues of the English,’ she said.

But Martha isn’t English, someone protested. ‘Quite,’ replied Violet, who later added that Martha is ‘like a homing pigeon, she finds our underbelly every time’. Is that what homing pigeons do?

Meanwhile, hang onto your inheritance, kids, for there is trouble looming. We know the Wall Street Crash is just a few years away, but Lord Grantham’s in the soup already.

He had to go up to London on the 2.30 train to see Somebody In An Office Wearing A Fobwatch. This can only mean one thing.

You see, the dopey Earl invested all of his wife’s money in something called the Canadian Grand Trunk Line — and it has only gorn off the rails!

‘Are you really telling me all the money has gone? The lion’s share of Cora’s fortune?’ he shouted, as Fobwatch nodded sadly.

Inspecting her surroundings: Martha looks around as the the much-loved Downton characters return

‘I refuse to be the failure, the Earl who dropped the torch and let the flame go out. I have a duty beyond saving my own skin,’ he said, munching through the freshly steamed script like a hungry termite.

You know, I’m beginning to think that 
Cora might be a little mad. It’s not just that simpering smile. Maybe 
that slip on a bar of soap in series one damaged more than we ever knew?

Back at Downton, when he told Cora the bad news, she admonished the silly sausage as if he had merely lost one of his socks, not her hard-inherited millions.

You know, I’m beginning to think that Cora might be a little mad. It’s not just that simpering smile. Maybe that slip on a bar of soap in series one damaged more than we ever knew?

Still, the money might have gone but, amazingly, by some kind of well-I-never dramatic osmosis, the earl-in-waiting was thinking of downsizing anyway.

It's a pleasure: Martha (l) with Jessica Brown Findlay as Lady Sybil (c) and Michelle Dockery as Lady Mary (r)

‘To be honest,’ Matthew told his valet, ‘I want to live more simply after the wedding.’

That’s lucky! You know, sometimes the Doctor Who plots are more realistic than the Downton ones, but no one really cares. It is all part of the joy.

And speaking of lost luggage, here comes 
poor Edith; the plain one, the sister without a mister. Is she forever 
doomed to wander from drawing room to dining room being bright and 
brittle and single?

And that’s not the only change with Matthew. Why has the pale-eyed Downton dish started wearing too many clothes? He is always trundling around in layers and layers of hats, coats, jackets, waistcoats ties, macs, and what have you. He is beginning to look like a packed suitcase.

She has set her jaunty cap at family friend Sir Anthony Strallan, who appears to dance at the other end of the ballroom, if that knowing look at Thomas the evil footman was anything to go by. Still, it’s not as if anyone was rubbing her face in it.

Fellow stars: Martha with actress Maggie Smith, who plays Violet, Dowager Countess of Grantham

‘Weddings can be reminders of one’s loneliness,’ Sir Anthony told her, while Grandma Martha asked her tartly: ‘Still no one special?’

Yes, hurrah. Branson the furiously Fenian
chauffeur is back and already in a pickle. Inside his appropriately 
downtrodden Oirish tweeds, he bristles like a very angry hedgehog

It could have been worse! She could have married the chauffeur and brought disgrace on the whole family.

‘Please don’t talk about Ireland all the time,’ begged his wife, Lady Sybil. But are yew jokin’ me? He doesn’t know when to stop.

‘We’re in sight of throwing off the English yoke . . . the Black and Tans. Oppression . . . the old me would want to put a bomb under the lot of ye,’ he yabbers.

Line-up: Lady Mary and Lady Sybil stand with Joanne Froggatt as Anna (l-r) in the show's third series

No wonder someone drugged his drink. I would have done it myself, had I been there.

(By the way, the ruling classes back in the day treated their servants terribly, and were unutterable snobs. So it seems barely credible that an earl would allow a Branson back into his house, to his dining table, to sleep with his daughter under his roof. It would have been more realistic if he’d had him horsewhipped. But let’s not be picky.)

It was a glorious opening episode, with 
lots of helpful reminders of what happened last time around to help the 
hard of understanding

Attention! Plot points alert.

‘May
I remind you that in this house, Mr Bates is still a wronged man,’ said
Mr Carson, just in case you’d forgotten one of the staff was in the 
clink for murder.

Meanwhile, Matthew had to remind his really annoying mother about the 
family scandal. ‘An earl’s daughter has run off with the chauffeur,’ he 
noted.

Gentlemen: Pictured are Hugh Bonneville as Earl of Grantham, Robert, and Jim Carter as Mr Carson (l-r)

As for the Earl himself, he was struggling to maintain a facade of bonhomie as the reality of his economic disaster came crashing in. ‘Hello Mama, can I tempt you to one of these new cocktails?’ he said, waving a martini glass around in an at tempt to pretend everything was tickey-boo.

It all ended with Mary walking down the aisle just about to marry her Matthew, as Martha and Violet jostled together on the pews like two giant chaffinches.

Will the happy couple say I do? They are 
going to keep us guessing until next week, although there were some 
tender scenes with Matthew and Mary as they stumbled towards the altar 
like the lovestruck young fools they are

‘There are a lot of things I am looking forward to,’ he told her, with a very fruity look. Clearly, the old trouser tingle incident is nothing but a faint memory.

Still hovering in the background is a dodgy will, another inheritance, a giant footman, Mrs Patmore’s treacle tarts and a blast from the past. Roll on next Sunday.
