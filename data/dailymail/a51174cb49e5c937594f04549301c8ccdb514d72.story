Rodeo cowboy legend Alvin Nelson has died at the age of 80 in Minnesota.

Nelson was a member of half a dozen halls of fame and North Dakota's only world champion saddle bronc rider for 24 years.

Nelson, of Grassy Butte, died Dec. 23 at a hospital in Rochester, Minnesota, according to Fulkerson Funeral Home. 

His funeral is scheduled for Wednesday in Watford City, North Dakota.

Nelson won the saddle bronc world championship in 1957 at Madison Square Garden in New York. 

He qualified for five Wrangler National Finals Rodeos, winning the saddle bronc riding average at the finals in 1961 and 1962, and also the all-around title in 1961 in Dallas.

Nelson told the Minot Daily News in 2004 that he remembered his 1957 title well.

'The rodeo lasted three weeks in September, and at that time, it was the world's largest rodeo according to prize money, number of spectators and the number of contestants,' he said as he was preparing to be inducted into the ProRodeo Hall of Fame.

'There were eight rounds. I split third and fourth on the first horse, won the second round, split first and second in the last two rounds to win $4,234,' he said. 

'This was the most money ever won in the saddle bronc riding at any one rodeo at the time, and this record stood until 1980.'
