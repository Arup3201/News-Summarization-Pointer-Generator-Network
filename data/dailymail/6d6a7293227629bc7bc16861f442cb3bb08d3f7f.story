Wearing a 'Don't frack my future' T-shirt and fighting against the grip of four police officers, Marina Pepper was today removed from a rural drilling site she and a group of 100 campaigners have occupied for the last five days.

Mrs Pepper, who has worked as a Playboy model and Page Three girl, was carried away from the oil drilling site by officers after she tried to stop a lorry of office furniture from entering.

The 45-year-old Liberal Democrat councillor is believed to have tried to create a blockage as deliveries of equipment were made to the site near Balcombe, West Sussex.

Forcibly removed: Marina Pepper was carried away from the scene where protestors were blocking a lorry near Balcombe

Not without a fight: The Liberal Democrat councillor pushes against the four police officers, who hold her by her arms and ankles

Cause: Mrs Pepper has become the face of the anti-fracking campaign which has taken hold by the site which is run by Cuadrilla

Six campaigners were today arrested at the site which is run by energy company Cuadrilla, bringing the total number of people held since Friday morning to 23.

Protesters are fearful that the 
exploratory oil drilling planned at Balcombe could lead to fracking, the contorversial process of pumping high pressure liquid underground to 
split shale rock and free gas.

Campaigners against the method have raised concerns about the chemicals used in fracking as well
as the impact on the environment.

Sussex Police said policing the protest has put a strain on their resources, with 'some proactive work' being postponed as a result.

Loud and clear: Demonstrators tried to prevent police officers from escorting a lorry carrying equipment for the drilling site

The campaigners have counted Bianca Jagger- the former model and ex-wife of Rolling Stone Mick Jagger- in their company.

Anna Dart, of Frack Free Balcombe, said 
around 100 people turned out to protest today, including a pregnant 
woman who stood in front of a truck.

She said: 'We are not going away. We 
have already caused significant delays. Over 90% of the Balcombe 
community have said they support non-violent action.

'We are being brought food and water by 
villagers and our toilets have been hired by Greenpeace. The villagers 
have been incredibly supportive. One even brought down cream teas from a
wedding.'

Stand off: Police prepare to eascort the lorry into the Cuardilla site. The company has fracked elsewhere and protestors fear they will do so at the Balcombe site in the future

Costly: Superintendent Steve Whitton, of Sussex Police said their resources have been stretched by policing the demonstrations

Superintendent Steve Whitton, of Sussex Police, said his officers were doing their best to strike a balance between people’s right to protest alongside Cuadrilla’s right to operate.

He said: 'We understand how strongly some people feel about the issue of fracking but it is important that they work with us to protest safely and peacefully.

'Our primary tactic is to talk to 
people, and officers are going to great lengths to explain to people why
we are there and what is acceptable in terms of their safety and others
working at the location.

'When
we police these kinds of demonstrations we will always look for a 
negotiated response. We would much rather talk to people and persuade 
them to move than use coercion.

'Some
pictures in the media look dramatic. What they often don’t show is the 
length officers have gone to persuade protesters to move.

Arrests: Six people were arrested today, taking the total number of protestors held by the police to 23

Blockade: The crowd of protestors stood in front of the delivery lorry, blocking its way into the drilling site

Struggle: Police said their aim was to move people by talking to them, rather than physically removing them

'If protesters block the way and it is lawful for the company to operate then they need to move.

'If they are repeatedly asked to move, and at times are putting their own safety at risk, some level of coercion has to be used.'

Cuadrilla rebutted rumours that it had 
suspended plans to drill because of the protests, with officials saying 
drilling will start as soon as possible.

The company has said it has followed all
legal and regulatory procedures concerning its exploratory drilling 
plans and obtained relevant approvals.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
