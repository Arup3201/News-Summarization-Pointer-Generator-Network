So far he has yet to master the 
phrases 'Please may I have another bun?' and 'Eek, a mouse!'

But Koshik 
the elephant has made a start, by learning how to speak five words in a 
human-like voice.

The 22-year-old male, housed in a South Korean zoo, 
places the end of his trunk in his mouth and, rather than coming out as a
low rumble, the sound matches human speech in pitch and tone.

Look who's talking now: Angela Stoeger and Daniel Mietchen of the University of Vienna recording Koshik's vocalizations at the Everland Zoo in South Korea

Last 
week, Californian researchers told of a white whale that liked to tell 
divers to get out of his pool. NoC, as he was called, was also fond of 
holding burbling 'conversations' with himself. However, he 'spoke' for 
only a few years.

Koshik, in contrast, has been chatting away in Korean 
since August 2004, when he was 14.

Sometimes he speaks when prompted, 
other times without any encouragement, the journal Current Biology 
reports.

Researcher Angela Stoeger, an expert in elephant communication,
said: 'Human speech has two important aspects, pitch and timbre.

'Intriguingly, Koshik is capable of matching both. This is remarkable 
considering the anatomical differences between an elephant and a human.'

Ms Stoeger and her colleagues played 
recordings of Koshik's calls to native Korean speakers to see if they 
could understand what he was saying.

'We found a high agreement concerning 
the overall meaning, and even the Korean spelling of Koshikâ€™s 
imitations,' Ms Stoeger said.

It is thought that Koshik, an Asian elephant, learned to mimic human 
speech to bond with his trainers when he was kept alone for five years 
as a young animal.

His five words spelt phonetically are annyong, anja, 
aniya, nuo and choah. They mean: hello, sit down, no, lie down and good.

Despite Koshik's apparent ingenuity, scientists don't think that he 
actually means what he says.

They add that he might not be the only 
pachyderm which has proved to be a good mimic. African elephants have 
been known to imitate the sound of truck engines, while a male in a zoo 
in Kazakhstan was said to talk in both Russian and Kazakh. However, his 
abilities were never scientifically investigated.
