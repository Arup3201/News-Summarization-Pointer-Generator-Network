A three-year-old girl who was beaten so badly that part of her skull had to be removed was given a police escort home yesterday.

Kilah Davenport was hospitalised in May after she was assaulted at home in Union County, North Carolina. Doctors had to remove part of her skull to reduce swelling and bleeding from her brain.

Her stepfather Joshua Houser, 22, has been charged with child abuse and inflicting serious injury.

Kilah was yesterday flanked by an escort of police cars and fire engines as she was welcomed by friends and family back at home.

He mother Kirbi Davenport hailed her daughter a 'miracle'.

She told WSOCtv.com: 'Doctors told me I would never take her home and now I get to. It's like taking home a newborn baby for the first time.

'I've watched her for 63 days fight to prove everybody wrong, and we're not done.'

When Kilah was first admitted to hospital in May, she was placed in a coma suffering a brain injury, fractured skull, broken collarbone and bruises on her body.

Doctors at Jeff Gordon Children's Hospital in nearby Concord told her family that she might not survive her injuries.

Miss Davenport had left Kilah in Houser's care when she went to work the day before his arrest.

While the child was alone with Houser, he injured the girl, police said.

Miss Davenport had only been married to Houser for ten months at the time of his arrest.

The mother revealed in the days after Houser's arrest that she is pregnant with his child.

Authorities have not disclosed details of exactly what happened between the child and Houser to cause the injuries.

Miss Davenport said: 'I trusted him to take care of her that day and he didn't. He ended up hurting my baby.'

She
is now campaigning for a law in Kilah's name to increase the jail 
sentence for child abuse to 25 years to life and toc reate a chid abuse 
register.

She said: 'I 
want to make sure that nobody else goes through what I've been through 
and what my parents have been through, more or less what my Kilah's been
through.'

Houser is currently in custody awaiting trial. He is scheduled to appear in court on September 4.
