A woman has died after her van was 'riddled with bullets' while she was driving on Chicago's Lake Shore Drive early this morning.

The shocking slaying comes days after a 15-year-old girl was randomly gunned down in a south-side neighborhood on Tuesday and brings the city's death toll for 2013 to at least 43.

Today's shooting occurred at around 4 a.m. on the Lake Shore Drive ramp leading to Interstate 55.

The 32-year-old woman was traveling south with a 37-year-old female passenger in her 2000 white Dodge when a 'brown full-size van' pulled in next to them and someone opened fire.

Police said the gunman fired 10 to 14 rounds into the vehicle, shooting the driver and causing her to crash into the median, CBS Chicago reported.

Officers responding to reports of a crash arrived to find the van riddled with bullets. The driver was taken to Northwestern Memorial Hospital.

The passenger was not injured and is now being questioned by police as a witness. No other cars were involved in the crash and authorities are now hunting the shooter.

Police said the shooting was related to gang and drug activity and was not random or a case of road rage.

'Based on the preliminary information, 
it appears that this incident stems from gun and drug activity. Thereâ€™s 
no danger to the public. We believe this is an isolated issue,' Illinois
Police Captain Luis Gutierrez said.

Access to both interstates from southbound Lake Shore Drive were closed after the shooting.

The woman is the latest victim of Chicago's out-of-control gun violence.

The city recorded its most deadly January in more than 10 years, with 42 murders, and February looks set to follow suit.

The last time there were as many murders in January was in 2002, when 45 homicides were recorded.

On Tuesday, Hadiya Pendleton, 15, was randomly gunned down just days after performing at Obama's inauguration ceremony.

The beautiful teen was shot in the back while she was huddled with friends sheltering from the rain near her high school.

She had just taken her final exams and described Obama's inauguration day, where she performed as a majorette dancer with her high school band, as the 'happiest day of her life'.

Police believe she was an 'unintended target' caught in the middle of a gangster showdown.

'As usual, the bad guy aims, but he never hits the other bad guy. He hits the one that hurts the most to lose,' Chicago Police Officer and attorney Damon Stewart, 36, Hadiya's godfather, told Fox32.

The deaths come after Obama announced plans to ban assault weapons as part of a drastic overhaul of gun laws.
