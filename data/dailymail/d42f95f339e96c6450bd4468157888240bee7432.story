There have been rocks that look like traffic lights, and even a perfectly rounded stone discovered on the surface of Mars. 

But the latest bizarre formation appears to show a rock in the shape of a cannon. 

Nasa has been beaming photos from the red planet since its Curiosity rover landed in August 2012, and this latest discovery was spotted by amateur astronomer Joe White, 45, from Bristol.

Nasa has been beaming photos from Mars since its Curiosity rover landed in August 2012, and this latest discovery (pictured left) was spotted by amateur astronomer Joe White, from Bristol. Mr White said: 'I think it looks like an artillery piece - but it's way too small for that really.' Stock image of a cannon pictured right

The 45-year-old space video journalist said he noticed a chuck of rock in the corner of footage while scanning Nasa's official images. 

He said: 'I think it looks like a gun - as in an artillery piece - but it's way too small for that really.'

Last month, a perfectly rounded rock was also spotted on the Martian surface, and continuing the cannon analogy, it looks similar to a cannonball. 

The rover's top speed is 1.5 inches (3.8 centimetres) per second.

Curiosity is the fourth rover to visit Mars.

It took around seven minutes to land on the Red Planet.

The rover is fitted with 17 cameras.

It weighs about the same as a Mini Cooper at approximately 900kg (2,000lbs).

Scientists considered 60 possible landing sites before deciding on Gale Crater. 

The same week, a rock shaped like a traffic light was also spotted as Curiosity roamed around the base of Mars' Mount Sharp. 

In the image, a set of three large rocks - admittedly with a larger fourth one as well - are shown being stacked on top of each other.

They bear a striking resemblance to traffic lights on Earth.

But it’s highly unlikely this same feature was built by a martian civilisation. 

The image was shot from the six-foot (1.8 metre) high, left-hand side mast cam on the Curiosity Rover. 

The 'traffic light' rock was also spotted by Mr White, who runs a YouTube channel called ArtAlienTV.

‘I saw this one and I thought “hang on, that looks a bit strange”. I think it looks like a traffic light.

‘It is hard to tell how big it would be without any point of reference, but I would estimate it was about 12 inches [30.5cm].

‘I posted it on the internet and people said they thought it looked like a set of traffic lights too - although some people did say it looked like a totem pole.’ 

The Curiosity rover recently spotted a rock that looks like traffic lights on Mars (shown in the red ring in this image). Washington-based Nasa is yet to comment on the latest discovery. The finding highlights just how weird and wonderful some of the rock formations on Mars can be

The rock was spotted by space video journalist Joe White. Mr White said: 'I saw this one and I thought "hang on, that looks a bit strange". I think it looks like a traffic light' (stock image shown). The image from Curiosity is just one of many fascinating rocks on the red planet that resembles something we are familiar with on Earth

Just days earlier, Curiosity spotted the ball-shaped rock on the surface of Mars.

Nasa said it was likely an example of Martian concretion, the process of compacting and hardening a mass of matter, according to Discovery News.

Curiosity is currently at the base of Mount Sharp, which has been the target for the mission since it landed just over two years ago.

The area is geologically fascinating as it contains layers that may provide an insight into the history of Mars.

And, scientists hope the region might reveal how and why Mars lost what was once thought to be a habitable environment, with water flowing on its surface.

This, in turn, may provide answers on the future of Earth.

The discovery follows another intriguing image that showed an almost perfectly round rock on the Martian surface (shown). Nasa said it was likely an example of Martian concretion, the process of compacting and hardening a mass of matter. Continuing the cannon analogy, it also looks like a cannonball

Last month, India's first mission to Mars, the ISRO's Mars Orbiter, arrived at Mars and released its first image (shown) of the red planet's surface. 'Howdy @MarsCuriosity? Keep in touch. I'll be around' the team for the orbiter tweeted on its arrival
