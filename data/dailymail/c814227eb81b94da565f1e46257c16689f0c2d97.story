Relief: Richard Wheatley with his wife Carol. He finally went to the doctor after experiencing a number of seemingly unrelated symptoms

A fitness fanatic has revealed how a chance remark about his 'croaky voice' saved his life.

The comment by a stranger prompted 50-year-old Richard Wheatley to finally go to his doctor. A brain tumour the size of a golf ball was discovered just in time.

It was only after surgeons operated that he realised he had acted just in time - because the tumour eventually would have killed him.

Mr Wheatley from Warwick, said: 'It was a worrying time but the operation went well and things have improved massively.

'I’m still recuperating and have trouble with my voice if I talk for too long, but when you consider what the alternative could have been I consider myself lucky to be alive.'

Keen runner Richard had completed the London Marathon twice and continued to keep himself fit. However, six years ago he began losing muscle around his right shoulder. He had the problem checked out but no-one could tell him what was wrong.

Richard then began to suffer a string of seemingly unrelated minor problems, such as losing his voice and struggling to swallow. He also began losing his balance.

He said: 'I had been to the summit of Snowdon and Ben Nevis, but a trip to the Lake District worried me as I seemed so unsteady on my feet.

'Nothing by itself seemed bad enough to make me worry as it all happened over a period of time.

'I actually thought old age might be catching up with me.'

Richard decided to go back to his doctor in December after a stranger he met in St Lucia remarked that his voice sounded strange and croaky, confirming his own fears that it had changed.

Richard said: 'I thought my voice had changed - it would tire and start croaking - but my family hadn’t noticed. I put it down to the air conditioning in the office.'

This time he wrote down a full list of all his niggling problems, which was enough to worry his doctor.

was referred to the BMI Priory Hospital in Birmingham, where scans 
revealed a large, non-cancerous tumour inside his skull.

It was pressing on nerves in Richard’s brain and affecting his speech, balance and ability to swallow.

Days later, surgeons carried out a nine-hour operation to remove the tumour behind his right ear.

By the time the tumour was diagnosed Richard had suffered some nerve damage.

That means his voice still tires, he has some difficulty swallowing and his balance is still adjusting to the tumour being removed.

'Those are relatively little things,' said Richard, who works as a relationship manager at NatWest bank.

'I can still drive a car, go on holiday and live a very normal life. I owe my life to Mr Irving’s expertise, his team were fantastic.'

Although Richard is not going to do any more marathons, he has taken up golf and wants to start running again.

'I am determined to make the most of this second chance I have been given,' he said.
