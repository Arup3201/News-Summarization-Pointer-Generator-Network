Alec Baldwin has come to the defense of his former colleague Martin Bashir, saying that MSNBC went too far in firing the anchor over his call to have someone defecate in Sarah Palin's mouth.

'I'm sorry to learn that @MartinBashir is out at MSNBC... Bashir created great television,' the actor wrote on his Twitter account on Thursday.

'You can disapprove of Bashir's single remark and still acknowledge his talent.'

Baldwin has a vested interest in the firing as he was in a similar position less than two weeks earlier after he and his short-lived cable show were ousted from the network following his homophobic insults to reporters.

Hedging his bets: Baldwin came out against the comments but said that Bashir 'created great television'

Though Bashir made his inappropriate comments about the former Alaskan governor around the same time as Baldwin was recorded using the homophobic slur, Baldwin was fired much more quickly. The actor then cited the fact that Bashir had yet to be reprimanded as an example of the network's hypocrisy.

He clearly has changed his tune in light of the Wednesday afternoon announcement that Bashir was facing a similar fate after having his resignation accepted by MSNBC bosses.

Baldwin, 55, posted a string of Twitter messages to his widely-followed account saying that while what Bashir said was wrong, it was also wrong for him to be forced out over the incident.

'Broadcasters on certain networks are called upon to offer analysis of events and public policy, day in, day out often with tremendous aggression and scalding language,' Baldwin wrote.

'If, over the course of hundreds of hours on the air, they commit a foul then it's like high-sticking in hockey or a late hit in the NFL. Throw a flag. But to end someone's job?'

'Some of these cable venues really are Off-Off Television....And their need for a reliable, even forced, homogeneity is more apparent than ever. Whatever side of the political aisle they line up on.'

Bringing it to an end: Palin said that it was right for Bashir to leave his show and it showed him taking responsibility for his actions

Baldwin's show of support came hours after Bashir released a statement saying he would be leaving MSNBC after hosting his eponymous show on the channel for three years.

Palin also spoke out about the resignation, saying that his decision to take himself off the air was an example of the mainstream media doing the right thing.

'It was refreshing to see though that many in the media did come out and say look our standards have to be higher than this those with that platform- with the microphone, with a camera in their face- they have to have some more responsibility taken,' she said on Fox and Friends on Thursday morning.

His effort: Bashir previously apologized to the former Alaskan governor both on and off air but then took some time off from work and later returned announcing his resignation

Bashir previously apologized to Palin both on and off camera- which she accepted- but said that he decided his resignation was necessary.

'Upon further reflection, and after meeting with the President of MSNBC, I have tendered my resignation,' he wrote in his statement.

'I deeply regret what was said, will endeavor to work hard at making constructive contributions in the future and will always have a deep appreciation for our viewers â€“ who are the smartest, most compassionate and discerning of all television audiences.'
