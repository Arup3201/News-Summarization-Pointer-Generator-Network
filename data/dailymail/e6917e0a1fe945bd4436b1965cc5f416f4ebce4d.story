Taking bad news on the chin is not always easy – so perhaps Simon Cowell is simply trying to spread the load.

The 53-year-old revealed an unsightly series of chins as he took a spin in his Ferrari over the weekend.

It was a far cry from earlier in the 
year, when he looked considerably firmer around the face – but the music
mogul was showing the signs of a saggy jawline in an appearance on 
American TV last month.

Cowell has endured a tough few months 
as ratings for his UK X Factor show have slumped to their lowest ever 
levels. On Saturday, the ITV1 programme drew an average of just eight 
million viewers.

In 2010, it typically attracted 13.6million.

For the fourth week in a row, it was beaten by BBC1 rival Strictly Come Dancing, which was watched by 10.3million.

Sinitta, Cowell’s close friend and ex-girlfriend, said the current run has been the 'worst series ever'.

She told The People: ‘Simon says X 
Factor is his first baby. He worries about the show and there is a lot 
for him to worry about at the moment.

Spot the difference: Cowell looked slimmer in March, left, but by October was seen on TV looking puffed up

‘He has so much affection for the UK show, he is the boss and he wants to be back on UK TV.

Disappointed: Simon was annoyed to see Ella Henderson axed from the competition

‘The wrong people are going. He finds it frustrating. He doesn’t want the whole thing to fall apart.’

A spokesperson for Simon Cowell said: 'On a series like this, there are good and not-so-good years.
‘Certainly, Simon has been disappointed to lose some of the contestants, including Ella.

'However, The X Factor is a very 
unpredictable show and Simon is a great believer in the British public. 
There must have been something in her performance last week that did not
chime for whatever reason.

'It is no secret he has missed 
working on the UK show and he has not ruled out returning to the show as
a possibility in the future.'

Cowell has always denied having cosmetic surgery, but has been remarkably candid about his Botox use.

He once compared the wrinkle-smoothing injections to brushing his teeth, confessing: ‘Of course I have had it. I mean, for me, it’s like cleaning my teeth, you know? Something makes your teeth whiter or something stops you having lines.’

He added: 'I think you’ve got to be very careful as a guy, in particular, that you can end up looking really, really weird.'
