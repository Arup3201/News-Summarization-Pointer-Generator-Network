Mesut Ozil has tweeted his delight at Arsenal snapping up fitness coach Shad Forsythe, after the German FA confirmed that the American had left them to move to North London.

The fitness guru had been working with the German team since 2004 and was credited with playing an important role in their World Cup triumph this summer.

Ozil has worked with Forsythe for five years since breaking into the Germany squad, and the midfielder tweeted: ‘another world champion for the Gunners! ;-) welcome to #Arsenal, Shad Forsythe! #newFitnessCoach #AFC’.

Willkommen! Mesut Ozil welcomes the former Germany fitness coach Shad Forsythe to Arsenal 

Grateful: The German FA tweeted its thanks to the departed fitness coach for all his hard work

Forsythe will also be familiar to Arsenal’s other German internationals Per Mertesacker and Lukas Podolski, and he is tasked with ending the Gunners’ poor run of injuries.

Over recent years Arsenal have fallen short in the title race come March as injuries have began to take their toll.

If Forsythe can reduce Arsenal’s numbers on the treatment table, then he could prove to be as important a summer signing as Alexis Sanchez, Calum Chambers or Mathieu Debuchy.
