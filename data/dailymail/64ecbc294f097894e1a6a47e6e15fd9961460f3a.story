An man from Oklahoma decided to have a little fun as he was being booked by cops on Friday night.

An allegedly intoxicated Cabrone Brewer beamed a big goofy smile as police snapped this picture of him in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

Brewer, 32, had just come from a wedding and was arrested after his Volkswagen Beetle got stuck on train tracks.

Say cheese: 'This is going to end up in that mugshot paper, isn't it?' asked Carbone Brewer to cops who were taking his booking photo on Friday night

He called AAA, but police showed up because of the dangerous location where his car had stopped.

Authorities say when they arrived Brewer smelled like alcohol, 'had red, watery eyes, slightly slurred speech, and was unsteady on his feet,' according to a police report.

He was also booked on an outstanding warrant from 1999 when he had been given a ticket for transporting booze an open container.

The 32-year-old told the said the charge from 14 years ago was on his prom night.

When he arrived at the Tulsa Jail, Brewer said he 'figured [heâ€™d] have a little fun with it.'

He said he thought to himself, 'Well in that case, I might as well go for the gold' and made an outrageous face for the camera he told TulsaWorld.

He said that he didn't expect the incident to receive media attention, but he said it reminded him of how small a town Tulsa is.

He recently moved back after several years working as a copywriter in New York City.

Brewer was released from jail the following day after posting a $1,000 bond and paying his previous warrant's fine.
