Self-proclaimed 'Scottish aristocrats' Andrea and Colin Chisholm III appeared in a Florida court today where they agreed to voluntarily return to Minnesota to face charges over an alleged massive welfare fraud.

Chisholm, 62, and his wife 'Lady Andrea', 54, appeared in Broward County Court on Thursday, in blue jumpsuits and shackled at the waist, where they agreed to be extradited to Minnesota.

The hearing took only a few minutes, with the pair only speaking to answer quietly to the judge.

The Chisholms allegedly collected food 
stamps, welfare and Medicaid in Florida and Minnesota over a seven-year period while living a 
life of luxury aboard their $1.2million yacht and in a series of lavish 
homes.

The Chisholms are being held in separate Florida jails after being arrested on Monday 
at Port Everglades after being escorted by police from their hiding place in the Bahamas.

Authorities in Minnesota have 30 days to collect the alleged fraudsters.

The couple reportedly fled Minnesota with their seven-year-old son and their dog as investigators tightened the net around them.

Colin Chisholm had previously refused to speak to authorities and hired an attorney. 

They had
 been on the run for about six weeks, when on Monday they were visited 
in Freeport in the Bahamas by police who told them their visas had expired, 
reports the Orlando Sentinel.

The police escorted the couple, their young son and dog onto a ship headed to Fort Lauderdale, where they taken into custody.

They went peacefully. Their son and dog were turned over to other family members.

The
 couple claimed to be wealthy 
Scottish aristocrats while living in the community of Deephaven, 
Minnesota, where authorities pledged last month to do everything in their
 power to bring them to justice.

'These were rich folks ripping off the 
system,' Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said at a press 
conference. 'I will make sure they do hard time.'

While probation is the lightest sentence allowable for the charges of welfare fraud, Freeman vowed to push for prison time, the Minneapolis Star-Tribune reports.

'I can’t imagine a judge in this district allowing the Lord and Lady to get probation,' Freeman quipped.

The maximum sentence is a $100,000 fine and 20 years behind bars.

Along with the 
million-dollar yacht called the Andrea Aras, the couple have a grand, 
six-bedroom lakeside home, a beach property in Florida and a $30,000 
Lexus, investigators found.

Colin
 Chisholm III, claims he is from a long line of Scottish aristocracy and
 is a wealthy broadcasting executive, according to court filings.

Colin Chisholm III, 62, and his wife Lady Andrea, 54, are currently being held in a Florida jail without bail as they await extradition to Minnesota in the next 30 days

'Scottish aristocrats' Colin Chisholm the Third, 62, and his wife Lady Andrea, 54, have been charged with $165,000 in welfare fraud while it is alleged they were living on a $1.2million yacht in Florida

The Chisholms also had $3 million in bank accounts which they failed to declare, according to Hennepin County Attorney's office.

The
 couple were receiving public assistance for their medical care and food
 stamps in Minnesota for years while also allegedly collecting welfare 
in Florida.

According to the criminal complaint filed in February, the Chisholms applied for more than a dozen forms of medical assistance, welfare payments and food stamps. 

Lady Chisholm had her prenatal care for the couple's son in 2006 paid for by the state while claiming to be destitute.

The couple not only owned a $1.2million yacht but also a $30,000 Lexus and beach property in Florida

In the welfare applications, the couple allegedly lied about where they were living and who they were living with.

Colin Chisholm did not declare that he 
ran a business nor Lady Chisholm that she had a dog kennel which breeds 
championship-worthy Cavalier King Charles Spaniels.

According to the website for their company Strathglass Kennel, the couple trace their roots to the Clan Chisholm from the small village of Struy in the Scottish Highlands.

Chisholm is listed as the president and CEO of TCN Network, a satellite TV company serving the Carribbean.

Colin Chisholm the Third, 62, and his wife Lady Andrea, 54, of Deephaven, Minnesota, have been charged with wrongfully obtaining $165,000 in welfare and are still at large

Lady Chisholm is alleged to have claimed for state prenatal care despite having millions of dollars in the bank

More than $1 million dollars flowed through accounts he controlled as part of that company, the complaint states.

The couple were living with Lady Chisholm's mother in Minneapolis when they first applied for welfare in 2005.

However for the next two years, they resided on their Florida yacht, and later at a beach property in the state, none of which was ever declared, investigators claim.

In April 2007, the Chisholms came back to Minnesota and filled out forms for more benefits. 

In March 2008, they moved into a luxury home in Deephaven with Andrea’s grandparents Eloise and Francis Heidecker.

Francis died in February 2009 at age 94 and by September of that year, Eloise Heidecker and the Chisholms were evicted from the home.

They immediately moved to another Deephaven home on Lake Minnetonka with stunning waterfront views.

The home, built in 1909, has six bedrooms, five bathrooms and stretch to 5,800 sq ft set on 1.6 acres, according to property records.

None
 of these details were declared on welfare forms - nor the fact Andrea 
Chisholm had power of attorney and controlled the finances of her 
elderly grandmother.

The couple moved to a lakefront property on Lake Minnetonka in 2008 - all the while raking in thousands in welfare payments

Hennepin
 County Attorney Mike Freeman said on Friday: 'It is truly outrageous 
when persons of considerable means steal from the government and all of 
us taxpayers through abusing the social welfare system.

'We will prosecute this case with all the capacity we have.'

Hennepin
 County’s Human Services and Public Health Department terminated all 
welfare benefits to the Chisholms at the end of March 2012.

Prosecutors
 will ask that the judge be allowed to impose a longer sentence than the
 Minnesota Sentencing Guidelines call for because the Chisholms 
committed a major economic offense.
