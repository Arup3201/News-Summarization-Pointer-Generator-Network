A naked body scanner previously used at airports in both the US and UK has been put up for sale on eBay for $7,995 (£5,100).

The US seller has listed a Rapiscan Secure 1000 SP (Single Pose) Backscatter Body Scanner X-Ray on the website.

The scanner model was used at airports across America until last year and also trialed at Manchester Airport in the UK. 

The X-ray scanner, used in airports, is on sale on eBay for a bargain $7,995 (£5,100)

It's not an easy shipment, with the body scanner coming in three packages

The US Transport Safety Administration discarded the controversial model last year over privacy fears about the detailed images it showed on screen and Manchester also stopped using the scanners, while London's Heathrow Airport uses millimetre wave-based scanners.

However, they are still in use to check for hidden weapons at airports across Africa, including popular holiday spots Kenya and Tanzania, as well as at courthouses and prisons in the US.

The scanner is said by the user to cost around $113,000 (£73,000) at full price and is packaged in three crates.

The seller writes in the description that they 'sell government surplus' equipment, and that anyone interested is welcome to go along and 'inspect'. 

The description continues: 'The Secure 1000 bounces very low dose of x-rays off of a person to generate an image. This image is then analyzed by an operator to identify concealed potential threats.

'Front and Back Scanning for Comprehensive Threat Detection: The Secure 1000 SP generates a front and back scan simultaneously, which eliminates blind spots and potential opportunities for concealment, thereby increasing checkpoint security.'

The scanner, used in airports throughout the world, could be a fixture in someone's home

The scanner is being sold by a user who deals in 'government surplus,' and has a 100 per cent rating

Sadly for any worldwide interest, the ebay user cannot ship the item out of the US

Airport bodyscanners are used to detect hidden weapons, although some scientists claim the Rapiscan model could be tricked to miss guns and C-4 explosives.

The TSA spent a reported £1billion dollars installing the Rapiscan body scanners at airports, but they were eventually discarded due to privacy concerns and replaced with millimeter wave scanners. 

The item for sale is based in Chattanooga, Tennessee, US, and unfortunately to anyone overseas, will only be shipped locally.

Used at airport to check for knives, explosives, concealed liquids and narcotics, you could be the envy of all your friends with this security machine.

And it appears the listing is genuine, seller govsurplus2012 has a 100 per cent customer rating having sold 93 other items.

These include a number of Breath Easy Turbo Respirator Gas Masks, a Genuine Commercial Coin Sorter/ Counter, and 20 military high density half man target silhouettes.
