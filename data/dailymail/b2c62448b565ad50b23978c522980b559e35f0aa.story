Agatha Christie's debonaire detective leans on his cane with his top hat tucked under his arm, looking like a man who knows his own worth.

Now auction bidders have been driven to distraction by the image of the legendary Belgian detective on the front of a rare edition, paying a world record price for the novel that originally cost 37p.

The copy of Poirot Investigates sold for over £40,000 - smashing the world record price for a book by the author.

Pulling power: The 1924 dust jacket of Poirot Investigates that drove auction bidders to distraction

The 1924 edition was worth so much because it came with its dust jacket showing a picture of the Belgian detective.

Collectors and dealers were frantically bidding for the collection of short stories that had a pre-sale estimate of £3,000 to £5,000.

The image bears more than a passing resemblance to Poirot as played by actor David Suchet and shows the famously egotistical detective wearing a morning suit with bow tie, spats and carrying his top hat and white gloves.

When it was published, the book cost 7/6 - equivalent to 37.5 pence - but sold for a hammer price of £34,000 at auction. With premiums added on, the sum went up to £40,630.

The previous record for a Christie book is believed to have been a copy of her first novel, Mysterious Affair At Styles.

It sold in 2009 for £10,000 but has now been put into the shade by the sale at Dominic Winter saleroom near Cirencester, Gloucestershire.

Agatha Christie, who also wrote under the name Mary Westmacott, died in 1976 having written more than 70 detective novels, most famously featuring her creations Hercule Poirot and Miss Jane Marple.

Chris Albury, from Dominic Winter auction house, said: 'We had a sense that this might happen, but it really took off.

'Every once in a while a rare and collectable first edition turns up in a dust wrapper that has never been seen on the open market before, or at least in living memory of the specialists.

'This is one such book and while it may not be the first Poirot book, it is the first to feature the detective’s name in the title and the first to show a portrait of him.

'The standing, confident figure that stares out at the reader is instantaneously recognisable to anyone familiar with David Suchet’s portrayals.

'Agatha Christie had previously published Poirot books and the editor of The Sketch was a fan and commissioned some more.

'They were later published and the 
Sketch’s image of Poirot was used on the dust jacket. And the fact this 
had a dust jacket made it incredibly rare.

'There might be some others with the Christie family but for collectors this was probably the only chance they would have of owning one.

'The dust jacket was a little bit chipped but was in a remarkable fresh condition.

'Most people would have probably thrown the dust jacket away after they bought the book, which is why there are so few left.'

Mr Jonkers, of Jonkers Rare Books, said: 'It is very uncommon to find this in a dust wrapper and I know of only two others in existence.

'I think I got it rather cheaply and would have paid a great deal more for it.

'The book is uncommon in its own right as are all books by Christie before she moved to Collins in 1926.

'It is quite a find and in very, very nice condition.'
