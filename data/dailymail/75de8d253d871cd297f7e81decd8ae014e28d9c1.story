Brendan Rodgers has called for cool heads as he reminded Liverpool’s players they are not racing against time in Tuesday’s collision with Basle.

Liverpool need a win to reach the Champions League’s last 16 but, as Rodgers pointed out, they only need one goal to knock the Swiss side out of the tournament.

Part of Liverpool’s threat under Rodgers’ last season was the devastating starts that blew teams away – beating Arsenal 5-1 is perhaps the best example – and there has been a longing from supporters to see that verve return to their play.

'We would have taken that. I looked at Ludogorets and this game as being key when the draw was made. It is up to us to get the job complete,' he said at the club's pre-match press conference on Monday.

'This is a competition that has a great history. That Olympiakos game [in 2004] was a part of the great history. It’s now up to them to write themselves into folklore. We can’t be relying solely on Steven [Gerrard]. 

'It is up to other players to be the catalyst. When you are world class, the weight falls on your shoulders but for us to get the result we need, we need the team to be functioning at a good level. 

'We are only focusing on the positive. If we get through we can put it to bed and that will give us confidence. I think we are slowly coming back together after a slow period. I have seen signs in recent games of it coming together again. 

'We know it is going to be a tough game but we have seen how the crowd can get behind you. If we get through, we can put it behind us and we will have confidence for the rest of our games.'

In October's reverse fixture a Marco Streller goal gave Basle a 1-0 win against Liverpool. However, the Swiss side have struggled on the road in the Champions League this season - losing away to Real Madrid and Ludogorets.

The visitors require just a draw at Anfield to go through at Liverpool's expense, but Rodgers is confident the Reds can get the job done on home turf.

'We go into the game in a good condition. It is going to be a tough game. Basle have lost their away games so far and I’m sure they know it is going to be tough. We don’t have to win the game in the first minute. We have to retain our patience, play a good technical game. If we retain our focus, I believe we will have a great chance. We do not underestimate our opponent but our objective is to win and our focus is purely on ourselves to do that.

'We were a bit soft in our defending. We conceded a disappointing goal from a corner. It has been a learning period and we have shown in the last few weeks we have been learning. We go into the game in a much better mind-set than we were back then.
