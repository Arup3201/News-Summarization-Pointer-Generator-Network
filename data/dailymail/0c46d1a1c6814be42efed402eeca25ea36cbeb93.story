Britain's men’s lightweight four drained themselves of so much energy in their rowing final they literally had to be helped from their boat.

The crew lay exhausted on the pontoon at Eton Dorney after winning silver in a thrilling race yesterday.

After being pipped to the gold by a quarter of a second, Chris Bartley was too weak to get back in the boat and row up to the podium with his crew mates. Instead he had to walk over, supported by race workers.

Richard Chambers, 27, and his brother Peter, 22, from Northern Ireland, Bartley, 28, from Wrexham, and Rob Williams, 27, from Maidenhead, Berkshire, looked emotional as they stood side-by-side with their medals around their necks.

Bartley said: ‘I don’t remember that much of the last 250m to be honest. We were so determined to come away with a medal and get to the podium that you will literally do anything to get there. The pain is so extreme.’

Richard Chambers, who was met at the finish line by wife Abi, 26, and nine-month-old baby Joshua, said: ‘We were in absolute agony. We had a fight to the death. We are on Cloud Nine.’

The race caused controversy when a row broke out over whether the men were given a lane which exposed them to the wind, preventing them from beating winners South Africa.

However, Williams – who learnt to row at nearby Maidenhead Rowing Club –said: ‘You can’t be upset when you’ve got a silver medal in the London Olympics with 30,000 Brits cheering you on.’

The silver medal is Britain's third in the rowing at this Olympics and the country's tenth overall

In a thrilling finale to the race, South Africa (second from bottom) held off Denmark (just behind them) and Britain (far side)

The British medal tally now stands at two golds, four silvers and four bronze medals.

Their success came on the back of 
Heather Stanning and Helen Glover's gold in the women's pair yesterday 
and took Britain into double figures in the overall tally in 12th place.

Britain had set the fastest time in the semi-finals but, in an open field, it was the Danes who set the pace.

At 750 metres, they held a length lead with Britain trailing in fifth, behind South Africa and Australia.

But there was plenty in reserve and with every stroke in the second half of the race, Britain gained ground on the leaders.

Eventually, Denmark were reeled in 
and South Africa were left to fend off the British challenge which 
ultimately fell just short despite the support of a vociferous home 
crowd.

The South African crew of James Thompson, Matthew Brittain, John Smith and Sizwe Ndlovu couldn't quite believe they'd won at the finish.

And with good reason - it was South Africa's first rowing gold.

After the race, Bartley said he had 'mixed emotions' about the race having seen the quartet enter the race as the fastest crew.

He had to be helped off the pontoon having given everything during the race.

But they received a rapturous reception from the crowd as they collected their silver medals and broke into broad smiles.

The crew included the brothers, Peter and Richard Chambers from Northern Ireland.

The Chambers duo became the first British brothers to win an Olympic medal since Greg and Jonny Searle took bronze in the coxless four at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.

Richard Chambers said: 'That was really, really brutal. We were just fighting, fighting through the whole thing to get ourselves back into contention.

'We struggled to keep with the pace of the other crews in the first quarter of the race but we dug our heels in and fought really hard.'

Peter Chambers said: 'We are gutted. We were unlucky to get a silver with those conditions. We're delighted with silver but we wanted to get gold.

'Fair play to the South Africans, they won that fair and square.'

Williams added: 'We wanted to win. We have to be happy to get a medal at our home Olympics. It's a shame we didn't win but what can you do? It's a shame.'

Following further success in this morning's session, Britain now has had or will have a crew in all 13 rowing finals.

In the morning's other events, the British women's eight finished fifth in their final having been unable to keep up with winners USA.

In the men's double sculls, the British pair of Bill Lucas and Sam Townsend finished fifth after making a strong start to the race. New Zealand's Joseph Sullivan and Nathan Cohen took gold.

Bungling Olympic officials 
were underfire tonight after it was revealed premium tickets were sold 
for the rowing event for seats which did not exist.

Angry fans who had forked out £95 to watch the climax of the heats at the finishing line turned up 
to find their seats in the grandstand had been turned into walkways.

Hundreds of disgruntled spectators were then ushered into a standing area - some 1,000 metres from the finish line.

Others who had bought tickets for the 
whole family found that in some cases some seats had been allocated them
- on different sides of the lake.

Bewildered fans inundated the ticket 
resolution office at the Dorney Lake venue in Eton, Berkshire, on the 
opening day of the Olympics Games on Saturday.

Embarrassed officials told them their 
seats did not exist and that their tickets would be downgraded to the 
£25 pounds category E in the standing area, with the price difference 
refunded.

A spokesman for the Games organisers, Locog, confirmed that there had been a problem with the Dorney Lake seating.

'The
small number of people affected in this instance on Saturday were 
immediately offered an alternative seat of the equivalent or higher 
value,' the spokesman claimed.

'The vast majority took up the offer 
of a seat which solved the problem. The refund policy was explained to 
the one or two individuals who requested information on how to get a 
refund.'
