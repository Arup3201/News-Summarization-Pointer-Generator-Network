A hanging 'paradise garden' crossing the Thames, complete with meandering walkways and lined with trees, is another 'Hillsborough disaster in the making', critics have claimed. 

A vision of London's garden pedestrian bridge, spanning the river between South Bank and Temple, has been granted planning permission by Westminster Council and is now set to be a reality.

But critics of the £175 million walkway - designed by Thomas Heatherwick, the creator of the London 2012 Olympic cauldron, and backed by actress Joanna Lumley - have claimed it is an accident of Hillsborough proportions waiting to happen, and warned that people will be forced to 'jump in the Thames' to avoid being crushed.

The plans were given the go-ahead last night at a packed public meeting. They must now be rubber-stamped by the Mayor of London and, if permission is granted, building will start late next year. 

The bridge will span the river between the South Bank and Temple station, and is due to open to the public in 2018. 

But concerns have been raised about visitor numbers around the South Bank, which could see 8,000 people an hour clambering to make their way across the walkway. 

Michael Ball, director of the Waterloo Community Development Group, told the Guardian: 'It's another Hillsborough disaster in the making. 

'They're dropping a tourist attraction, with projected visitor figures second only to Disneyland Paris, into an area that already sees 25 million people a year. The police haven't even been consulted over crowd control.

'The numbers are potentially catastrophic. I can see people jumping into the river to avoid being crushed.'

However, critics have raised concerns that the bridge may limit views of St Paul's Cathedral and other landmarks.

A report drafted for the committee considering planning permission said there would be 'significant impact' on views and that if the plans were for a commercial development the application would likely be refused.

Councillor Robert Davis, deputy leader of Westminster City Council, who chaired the committee, said: 'This is something that is iconic and absolutely unique, and will be recognised right across the world.

'I understand the concerns about potential loss of views, but there is no doubting that this bridge will bring substantial and significant benefits to London.'

According to the Garden Bridge Trust website, the bridge is designed to be 'somewhere to meet and spend time, with education and volunteering opportunities so people can get their hands dirty, helping with the upkeep of this new community garden'.

'It will also provide a new link between cultural centres and tourist attractions on the north and south banks,' it says. 

It would be the first new crossing across the Thames since the 'wobbly' Millennium Bridge opened in 2002 and London's answer to New York's High Line, where a disused train line has been transformed into a lush aerial park.

It is hoped the bridge will create 270 jobs, and provide better access for disabled people and children across the Thames.

Of 292 responses to the planning consultation, 279 were in favour of the plans.

The mayor's office has already pledged £30 million through Transport for London and another £30 million is due to come from the Treasury.

The remainder of the total cost of £175 million will be made up by private donors, with £110 million already pledged.

A spokesman for the trust said: 'The Garden Bridge Trust has undertaken a comprehensive transport assessment of demands for the bridge. This has been verified by independent consultants, appointed by South Bank stakeholders. 

'The assessment has been subject to scrutiny by both London Borough of Lambeth and Westminster City Council. The Garden Bridge Trust will actively manage and monitor visitor levels and ensure the safety and comfort of those visiting the bridge and those adjacent and the bridge.'

The Garden Bridge Trust plan to ask for donations from the public next year.

Lord Mervyn Davies, chairman of the Garden Bridge Trust, said: 'I am delighted with the news that Westminster City Council has shown its support for the garden bridge and approved our plans. This iconic new project will create a new green space in the centre of London and will be enjoyed by all.'

Concerns have also been raised about plans to ask large groups using the bridge to inform the Trust ahead of time.

A spokesman for the Trust said: 'Like other public spaces, the Garden Bridge Trust will need to manage numbers to ensure the comfort and safety of users.

'As is common practice amongst operators of public space, the Trust feels there needs to be a mechanism in place to account for larger groups.

'An initial figure put forward was for groups of greater than eight people. This was an initial discussion point, and the Trust is working with stakeholders and the Local Planning Authority to develop our proposal and confirm the agreed numbers.

'Once this number is confirmed, groups of greater than that size visiting the bridge will be requested to inform the Trust of their visit. This will not be an 'advance booking' but a mechanism to allow the Trust to better manage the number of users.

'It is not about limiting people from using the bridge. It is to ensure those who do visit the bridge have the best and most enjoyable experience possible.

'The Garden Bridge will protect existing views, enhance others and provide new beautiful views up and down the river that are currently not possible.'
