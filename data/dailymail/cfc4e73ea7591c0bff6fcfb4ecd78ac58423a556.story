Didier Drogba is hopeful of returning to action sooner than planned after injuring his right ankle in Sunday's 2-1 pre-season win against Ferencvaros.

Drogba went down clutching his ankle midway through the first-half and had to be replaced by Oscar after 28 minutes.

The former Ivory Coast international crumbled to the floor after trying to meet a cross inside the Ferencvaros box.

Speaking about his injury the striker told chelseafc.com: 'I twisted my ankle and I couldn't continue.

'In the next few days we are going to do some treatment and I hope everything will be better.'

Drogba will definitely miss the Blues' final pre-season game at home to Real Sociedad on Tuesday, with their Premier League opener against Burnley on 18 August.
