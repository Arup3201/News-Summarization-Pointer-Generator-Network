Two Chelsea Pensioners collecting money for the British Legion Poppy Appeal were refused a short sit-down at a restaurant  because staff said they were too busy, it has been claimed.

The men, who live at Royal Hospital Chelsea, were among celebrities and well-wishers fundraising in Covent Garden as part of Poppy Day London when they asked if they could rest for a few minutes. 

They were shocked when a member of staff at 21 restaurant allegedly told them they couldn't sit down, despite there being plenty of seats in the outside patio, the men claimed.

The men were two of thousands of collectors today taking part in Poppy Day London, the largest fundraising day for the British Legion appeal. 

Dressed in their signature red coats, the pensioners joined actress Barbara Windsor in the popular tourist square to raise funds. 

But when they approached 21, one of the many al-fresco restaurant in Covent Garden, staff said they could not said down. 

The restaurant's owner, Trevor Davies, tonight apologised for the incident and described it as a 'misunderstanding'. 

'I give my staff strict instructions not to let people take seats off site because what happens is people never see them again. 

'A lot of people we have, their English isn't quite good enough so when the gentlemen were asking to sit down they thought they meant taking the seats away and that's why they said no. 

'We wouldn't refuse them at all. If they want to come along and have a meal on me they can.' 

Staff at the restaurant allegedly refused them, however its owner tonight said they merely misunderstood the gentlemen's request

The restaurant is one of many in Covent Garden, central London, with expansive outdoor seating areas 

Thousands of fundraisers took part in Poppy Day London which was launched by Prince Harry and a handful of celebrities outside Buckingham Palace today
