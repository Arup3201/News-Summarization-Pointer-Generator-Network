Kasper Schmeichel could return for Leicester's key game with Hull this weekend after recovering from a broken foot.

The keeper has been out since December after breaking a metatarsal in training but is fully fit ahead of the visit of the Tigers on Saturday.

The Foxes signed Mark Schwarzer from Chelsea as cover in January while Ben Hamer also deputised for Schmeichel.

Leicester are bottom of the Barclays Premier League and seven points from safety but can now call on Denmark international Schmeichel.

Boss Nigel Pearson told a press conference: 'He is back in contention which is good. We have three keepers available which is always nice.

'It is only really Dean Hammond (calf) who is out, although he is back in training now, and Anthony (Knockaert) is not available because he has gone back to France to see his dad who is not very well. Those players apart we are pretty much a full squad.'

Leicester have lost five of their last six in the top flight and Pearson insisted they cannot rely on other sides slipping up.

He added: 'It'll be down to whether we get enough good results ourselves, we remain in the same position, there 11 games left and we have to do it ourselves.'
