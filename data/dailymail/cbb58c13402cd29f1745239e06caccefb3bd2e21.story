Pope Francis is the most influential Twitter user – or ‘tweep’ - in the world, a new study has revealed.

Although the Argentine Jesuit Pontiff is the second most followed world leader after Barack Obama, he massively outstrips the US President in the frequency with which his followers retweet his messages.

This makes him the most influential ‘tweep’ on the planet according to Twiplomacy 2014, a study of how Twitters is being used by world leaders.

More than 14 million people follow the Pope at @Pontifex in nine languages and each tweet made by the Pontiff is on average retweeted nearly 17,000 times, Twiplomacy revealed in a final report.

Although President Obama has 43.7 million followers of his @BarackObama account, his tweets are only retweeted an average of 1,400 times, meaning that the Holy Father’s tweets are retweeted more than 10 times as often.

Of the two, the Pope enjoys greater global reach because of the support of his followers for his tweets, which most commonly include the words ‘God’, ‘Jesus’ and ‘love’.

‘By this standard, Pope Francis @Pontifex is by far the most influential tweep with more than 10,000 retweets for every tweet he sends on his Spanish account and 6,462 retweets on average on his English account,’ the report said.

‘Venezuela’s President @NicolasMadurois in second position, receiving on average 2,065 retweets per tweet on his Spanish account.’ 

The report revealed that President Obama’s Twitter high point came the day after his re-election in 2009 when he tweeted a picture of himself with the slogan ‘four more years’. It became one of the four most popular tweets ever, retweeted 806,066 times.

‘However since then, the engagement on the account has been in decline,’ the report said. ‘Despite the account’s massive following, the @BarackObama tweets are on average only retweeted 1,442 times.’ 

After President Obama and Pope Francis, the third most followed world leader is Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono who has five million followers.

Prime Minister David Cameron (@Number10gov) is in 13th place with 2.6 million followers while the Queen (@BritishMonarchy) is in 36th place with 671,000 followers.

The Pope’s Twitter account was opened by his predecessor, Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, and is unique because his tweets are published in Spanish, English, French, German, Arabic, Portuguese, Polish and Latin.

‘The five most followed world leaders have one thing in common - they have discovered Twitter as a powerful one-way broadcasting tool,’ the Twiplomacy report said.It also noted the emergence of the phenomenon of ‘hashtag diplomacy’ whereby world leaders and diplomats are increasingly contacting each other through their Twitter accounts.

The report also revealed that eight world leaders have seen some of their tweet retweeted more than 24,000 times.

They include the announcement of the May election victory of Narendra Modi as Prime Minister of India, the abdication of the King of Spain, and the admission that Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 ‘ended in the southern Indian Ocean’.
