A retired Royal Navy captain has been arrested on suspicion of arson after allegedly crashing his car into a newly refurbished sailing club - 
causing it to burst into flames.

Clifford Caughey, 82, is believed to have been at the wheel when his 
green Volvo V40 Cross Country smashed into Emsworth Sailing Club in Hampshire at 6.35am 
today.

Eyewitness claim the car was driven straight toward the club at around 70mph - before hitting
 the front wall of the building, causing a loud explosion.

More than 30 firefighters were sent to tackle the blaze at the club, which was reopened by Paralympic sailing gold medallist
 Helena Lucas last year following a £35,000 renovation.

The flames completely 
destroyed the vehicle and quickly engulfed the club - turning its white 
walls a charcoal grey colour. 

Mr
 Caughey, who served as the commanding officer of the destroyer HMS Fife
 between 1982 and 1984, was rescued from his burnt-out car and is 
currently being treated at hospital for minor injuries.

A
 family living at the club at the time of the crash managed to escape 
unharmed, while other locals were temporarily evacuated from their 
homes.

Mr
 Caughey - known to his friends by his middle name, John - has now been 
arrested on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life.

The
 father of two and widower, who later become Queen's Harbour Master at 
Portsmouth Naval Dockyard, has been named locally, but is yet to be 
formally identified by police.

This afternoon, neighbours said Mr Caughey was in the process of moving house - and had appeared 'stressed' in recent weeks.

An
 estate agent confirmed he exchanged contracts on his old three-bedroom,
 detached property, in Emsworth, just a few days ago. It had been listed
 for sale for £795,000.

One
 neighbour said they believed he was moving to a smaller house half a 
mile away - on the same road as the sailing club, of which he was a 
member.

Another neighbour described the former Navy captain, whose wife Dorothy died nine years ago, as 'a lovely chap' who was close to his two children.

The
 elderly man, who asked not to be named, said: 'As far as I am aware, he was 
in good health, had no money worries, had lots of friends, and a loving 
family.

'He
 is not the sort of person who would want to harm others, so I can only 
imagine it was a tragic accident.

'John had so much to live for so he must have just flipped. It is all very distressing and baffling.'

However, neighbour Jean Howells, 72, said Mr Caughey had appeared 'a bit stressed' recently.

'He's lived here for quite a few years now. I know him reasonably well 
and he's always been really pleasant, and often says hello,' she said.

'He's a member of the sailing club - as am I. I think he really enjoys it. I saw him the other day in the garden and he seemed okay but I think he has seemed a bit stressed lately.

'He's in the middle of moving house and 
all I can think is that it has just got to him - its stressful moving 
house anyway and especially if you're on your own.'

Mr
 Caughey is believed to have put his Prout 31 sailing boat, named 
Starquest, up for sale a few years ago for an unknown price.

The
 advert said: 'Reluctantly, I am putting Starquest up for sale. She 
represents excellent value having had more than 50,000 pounds spent on 
her in the last four years.

'She has been very lightly used during the past 2 years, due to ill health.'

Yacht
 club Commodore Mr Clode, 69, who lives next door to the sailing club, 
said he had been listening to the radio in bed when he heard the 'massive 
bang' this morning.

He said he rushed to his bedroom window to see plumes of black smoke billowing from the building.

Incident: Mr Caughey, from Emsworth, is now being treated in hospital for minor injuries and has been arrested

'I
 had just switched on the radio at 6.30am when there was a massive 
bang,' he said. 'It sounded like someone had dropped a tonne of bricks 
into a skip from a great height. It was so loud that at first I thought 
the boilers at the club must have exploded.

'I said to my wife: "What the hell was 
that?" and we looked out of the window to see this huge plume of black 
smoke billowing from the club.

'Then we spotted the car embedded in the wall and realised what had happened. I threw on some clothes and ran down to the club.

'The blaze was well alight and the flames were 20ft high.
 They were licking the very eaves of the building, which was built in 
1875.

'For 10 minutes after the initial bang, there were several smaller bangs coming from the back of the car.

Towing it away: This afternoon, neighbours said Mr Caughey had appeared 'stressed' in recent weeks

'I
 don't know what it was but can only describe the noise as like 
fireworks. By this point, the driver had been taken out of the car
 and was being escorted up the road by two police officers.

'He looked in a very bad way and was taken away in some distress.'

Mr
 Clode said the crash appeared to have done some great damage to the 
sailing club, which was fitted with a new bar, training rooms, 
balcony and larger changing rooms during the refurbishment.

He added that club members were 'devastated' by the incident, saying: 'The driver was a longstanding member of the club and has many, many friends within the membership.

'There
 was absolutely no dispute with other members. What brought this about 
we have no idea and we need to find out through his family what brought 
this on.

'Everybody at the club is devastated this has happened.'

This evening, a police cordon remains in place outside the club to prevent people from getting close to it, while the Volvo V4 has been removed from the scene.

Investigators are now working to establish exactly what happened.

A Hampshire Fire and Rescue spokesman said: 'We were called to 
Emsworth Sailing Club after a car crashed into the building.

'The
 driver was rescued from the car and wasn’t hurt. A fire spread from the
 car onto the roof of the club and we have teams tackling the fire.

'We have fire crews from Emsworth, Havant, Hayling Island, the Special Equipment Unit from Cosham, and teams from Horndean.

'We also have also got a search and rescue team on stand-by to search the building once the fire is out.'

Earlier today, residents in Emsworth said they were saddened by the incident. Will
 Wallace, who lives in the small coastal town, told MailOnline: 'This event has shocked many 
residents. The sailing club is at the heart of the town.

'Many
 Emsworthians are keen sailors and the club provides both that and other
 social events. For this to happen in our community is deeply upsetting.'

Meanwhile,
 eyewitness, Sarah Jane Walker, wrote on Twitter: 'Explosion at sailing 
club 6.45 Emsworth. Huge ball of fire, black smoke. Family safe, but 
hope everyone else is too.'

And
 Bianca Jayne-Carr, who also saw the blaze, tweeted: 'Woke up to yelling
 this morning after a car crashed into Emsworth Sailing Club.

'Big explosion and the place is in flames. Crazy morning.'

The
 sailing club has announced it will remain closed for the rest of the 
week - and has appealed to members to 'stay away from the club at this 
time'.

A
 Hampshire Police spokesman said: 'We were called to an address at 
6:34am this morning following reports that a dark green coloured Volvo 
estate was involved in a collision with a building.

'No-one in 
the building was injured in the collision and a subsequent fire, the 
driver was treated for non-life threatening injuries.

'Some local residents were temporarily evacuated until the fire was extinguished and have now returned to their homes.

Destroyed: The club, pictured after the crash, was founded in 1919 by a small group of sailing enthusiasts

'An 82 year-old man from Emsworth has been arrested on suspicion of arson and is helping police with their enquiries.'

The
 revamped sailing club, which boasts more than 1,150 members, was 
officially reopened by Ms Lucas last May after undergoing the costly 
refurbishment.

Government
 agency, Sport England, provided £50,000 towards the work - while the 
rest of the cash came from the club and its members.

The club was originally set up as a bathing establishment around 1800. It was founded in its present form in 1919 by a small 
group of sailing enthusiasts.
