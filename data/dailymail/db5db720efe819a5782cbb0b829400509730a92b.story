The Queen’s great-granddaughter Savannah Phillips had plenty to smile about as she showed off a goldfish won at a fairground yesterday.

The three-year-old daughter of Princess Anne’s son Peter and wife Autumn bagged her prize on a visit to the Beaufort Hunt Point-to-Point in Gloucestershire with her parents and little sister Isla.

Later she enjoyed  a children’s swing ride.

A new pet! Autumn Phillips proudly brandishes the goldfish that her mother won for her in a carnival game

There was sunshine over much of Britain yesterday but, wisely, Savannah and her family wrapped up in coats and wellies... forecasters say more rain is on the way.

Autumn showed off her North American exuberance as she speared three cards with darts to win the fish.

She whooped and cheered after she coolly clinched a darts hat-trick in the carnival game that her husband had tried and failed at minutes earlier.

Then, showing off a typical mother's 
selflessness, she handed the prize pet to her delighted eldest daughter 
to take care of while they carried on their family fun day.

Triumph! Autumn Phillips coolly spears three playing cards with darts in a carnival game at the Duke of Beaufort's Point-to-Point races at Didmarton, Gloucestershire, then, right, whoops with delight

A prize for you, darling: Autumn hands the spoils - a goldfish - over to her daughter, Savannah, for safe keeping

What would we do without mums? Autumn's win came after her husband, Peter, failed to make the hat-trick

The country fair was blessed by pale winter sun, although judging by the coats and woolly hats worn by Peter, Autumn, Savannah and their youngest child Isla, one, temperatures stayed stubbornly chilly.

Both parents wore dark, well-insulated jackets, jeans and boots, their wintry look offset by dark glasses. Autumn accesorised with a white bobble hat.

Savannah's look echoed that of her mother and father, but for a bright red jacket, while her younger sister's grey coat was paired with Union Flag wellies and a pink, orange, blue and green bobble hat.

Fun of the fair: Savannah smiles contentedly as she enjoys a roundabout ride with other children

Isla looked on enviously as her big sister smiled contentedly on a roundabout ride that the one-year-old was not yet big enough to try out herself.

The tiny one looked most content in her mother's arms, pointing and smiling at the many sights and delights laid by the duke.

The current Duke of Beaufort, David Somerset, 86, is a well-known as a lover of horses and equestrian events. But he has faced his share of brickbats.

Look mummy: Peter and Autumn's youngest daughter, Isla, points as her sister enjoys the merry-go-round

I want a go! The one-year-old seemed captivated by the ride, but is still to young to have a go herself

He was embroiled in controversy in December when his hunt, said to be Prince Charles's favourite, was investigated for rampaging through a Cotswold town - allegedly in pursuit of a fox.

Fox hunting as a sport was banned in England in 2004.

Residents claimed around 40 horses from the Duke of Beaufort’s Hunt followed a pack of hounds who sped through Tetbury, Gloucestershire, in pursuit of the animal.

Family fun day: Peter takes the strain for a bit by carrying Isla as they move from stall to stall at the fair

Dressed for warmth: The whole family were well insulated against the cold, despite the pale winter sun

And in 2009 the Duke, who is one of Britain's richest men, faced criticism after he cashed in on a  400-year-old aristrocratic right by charging hard-up taxpayers £280,000 to build a bridge over his riverbed.

The Duke - worth an estimated £130million - demanded £281,431 for the walkway to stretch over the River Tawe, Swansea, which is more than 100 miles from his family seat in Badminton, Gloucestershire.

His family owns the bed of the River Tawe after Charles II gave it to his aristocratic ancestors for trout fishing rights.

Laughing and joking: Autumn smiles for the camera as the family stroll by, enjoying the fresh air

Weeeeeee! Savannah shows off her jumping skills

Last month the Duke's son, Lord Edward Somerset, was jailed for two years after repeatedly beating his wife in a series of drink- and drug-fuelled rampages over two decades.

Peter and Autumn have been together since 2003 and married since 2008.

Savannah, the Queen's first great-grandchild, was born in December 2010; Isla was born in March 2012.
