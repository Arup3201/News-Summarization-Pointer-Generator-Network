When the smoking ban was brought in six years ago, Jane Garner, 48, quickly became fed up of venturing outside for a cigarette break when she was having a drink.

So, with the help of her late husband Alan, she conjured up a way of getting round the problem - by building a pub in a shed in the back garden.

The project was their labour of love until Alan passed away two years ago at the age of 53, but wife Jane has vowed to carry on pulling pints in his memory.

Her very own local: Jane Garner pulls pints in the Gardners Arms, the pub she built in the back garden with her late husband Alan

Interior: The Gardners Arms has a pool table, an arcade machine and a dart board, where Alan Garner honed his skills before he died

Friends who visit the Gardners Arms in Greasbrough, Rotherham, can have a quiet pint or 
play the one-armed bandit or try a game of darts.

A stocked bar, beer pumps,
optics, a pool table and a gaming machine have also been installed in the shed which can hold around 60 people.

The pub recently received a visit by international darts stars Jimmy Hendriks and Darryl Fitton through contacts with top players including Bobby George and Eric Bristow.

Cheers: The Gardners Arms has enough room for 60 people and has enjoyed visits from international darts players Jimmy Hendriks and Darryl Fitton

Jane, who has a wedding and fancy 
dress business, said: 'Alan would have been in his element playing with 
Jimmy and Darryl in the Gardners Arms.

'It was amazing to see them there. Alan would have been blown away.

'Alan spent a lot of time in there honing his darts skills.

'Looking back Iâ€™m glad we built it and Alan was able to enjoy it.'

The couple decided to create their own pub in their large back garden six years ago as a rebellion against the smoking ban but the plan was put on ice when Alan fell ill on his 50th birthday.

He was diagnosed with heart disease but they were able to start fitting out the cabin and put in tables and pub furniture.

And when work was complete they were able to use the Gardners Arms on a regular basis and Alan, who played for a pub darts team, spent hours practising there.

Bar: The Gardners Arms has the equipment any customer would want in their local pub, including a selection of beer taps, bottled beer and optics
