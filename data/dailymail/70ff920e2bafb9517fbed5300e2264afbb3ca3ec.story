England's players were finally able to get out and train in the Miami heat on Tuesday after the weather held off. Roy Hodgson's squad had expected to have their first training session on Monday, but it was washed out because of a storm, forcing the players to train in the gym instead.Thankfully the weather was much improved on Tuesday, with conditions inside the Sun Life Stadium - home of the Miami Dolphins - so warm and humid that four giant fans were set up by the pitch to help keep staff and players cool.

As ever, 
the goalkeepers were first out, still wrapped up in base layer bottoms 
and layers of kit as coach Dave Watson led them through a warm up 
routine.

Gary Neville and Ray Lewington set out cones and mannequins on an immaculate surface ready for the outfield exercises.

As Hodgson waited for the rest of the players to emerge from the dressing room, he chatted to Sir Trevor Brooking and Dr Steve Peters - who has been helping the players prepare for the World Cup physiologically. 

The rest 
of the players finally emerged at 11am local time - when pitchside 
temperature, according to the FA's sports science team, measured at 27 
degrees.

As
 the serious business started, fitness coaches Chris Neville and Tony 
Strudwick warmed the players up in two groups. Neville had 12 players - 
eight defenders and four strikers - and Strudwick eight midfielders - meanng a full 
complement of 23, including the keepers, trained.

The
 midfielders were straight into ball work, with lots of touches and 
twists in a confined area, while the defenders and strikers practiced 
passing over a longer distance.

Some players - including James Milner, Chris Smalling and Phil Jones - wore the GPS vests to monitor their mileage during the session.

After Monday's aborted session, it was surely a relief for Hodgson and his players to be able to train as they look to build on the momentum of Friday's 3-0 win over Peru and overcome Ecuador on Wednesday evening.  

Capacity: 80,000

Who plays there? American football team the Miami Dolphins

Why are England there? England are training in the stadium ahead of Wednesday's friendly with Ecuador - which kicks off 8pm English time - and Saturday's game against Honduras.

How many fans are expected to attend? Unfortunately there may be quite a few empty seats on Wednesday as only 20,000 tickets have been sold so far. But the FA hope walk-up sales will swell the crowd.

How hot is it in the stadium? The FA's science team measure the temperature to be 27 degrees at 11am local time.
