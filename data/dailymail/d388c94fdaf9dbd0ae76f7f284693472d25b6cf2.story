Heather Watson will lead Great Britain's Fed Cup team at next month's Europe/Africa Zone Group I tournament in Budapest.

Watson, Johanna Konta and doubles team Jocelyn Rae and Anna Smith make up the line-up named by Judy Murray for the round-robin event, which takes place from February 4-7.

Britain are still without Laura Robson, who will not make her return to action until next month after a year out with left-wrist problems.

Murray's side will play three group matches, with the winners going forward to a play-off and the winners of that playing off in April for a place in World Group II.

Smith is in line to make her debut, and Murray said: 'Our goal as always is to get out of the Euro Africa Zone and into a play-off for World Group II.

'We are fielding our best two available singles players and a recognised and very promising doubles team. I believe this represents our best chance for success.'

Britain reached the World Group II play-offs in both 2012 and 2013 but lost to Sweden and Argentina respectively while last year they did not make it out of their group.

World number 50 Watson said: 'Playing Fed Cup is always a highlight for me during the year.

'Most of the time we are out there playing for ourselves, so it's always a lot of fun and a great honour to compete as a team and represent our country against some of the best in the world.'
