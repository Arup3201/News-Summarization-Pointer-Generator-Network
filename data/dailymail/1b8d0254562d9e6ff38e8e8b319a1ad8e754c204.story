When the Duchess of Cambridge was photographed with streaks of grey in her usually immaculate tresses, she decided it was high time to invest in some serious post-pregnancy styling.

She booked an emergency appointment at the most expensive hairdresser in the country, then spent a marathon six hours being coiffed, coloured and blow-dried to ensure she was restored to her status as yummy mummy in chief.

The Mail on Sunday has been told Kate spent more than half a day at the luxurious Rossano Ferretti hair spa in central London where a haircut with Italian-born Mr Ferretti costs £600.

The 31-year-old Duchess arrived shortly after midday in a car with blacked-out windows and was whisked up to the VIP club suite on the third floor where she had her hair attended to in complete privacy by one of the salon’s leading colour technicians.

Staff were told that ‘a VIP was in residence’ and lift access was shut off to make sure there were no interruptions. When she eventually emerged at 6pm, the Duchess was back to her former self – her crowning glory restored to a mass of tumbling chestnut-coloured curls.

One witness who saw Kate leave said: ‘She looked amazing. She was dressed in a tartan cape and was made up. Her hair looked fabulous, really big and glossy, and it was flowing around her shoulders.’

It was Kate’s first opportunity Kate to indulge in some pampering since the birth of Prince George.

Because she has been breastfeeding, she has spent most of her time at home with her son lately and her hair and beauty regime has understandably not been a priority.

But the Duchess was apparently horrified by how grey she looked when she saw pictures of herself at a Poppy Appeal event. So after being recommended to Rossano Ferretti by her sister Pippa, she checked herself in.

Kate has previously had her hair cut and coloured at the Richard Ward salon in bustling Duke of York Square off Sloane Street in Chelsea.

The Rossano Ferretti spa is quite different - occupying a discreet and innocuous building just off Hanover Square in the West End.

The Regency-style property looks more like a house than a hairdresser’s, but once you step inside, you are in hairdressing heaven, according to regulars.

‘It is the most luxurious place I have ever worked,’ said a member of staff who asked not to be named. ‘The client has their own suite and it’s incredibly private.’

Members of the Saudi royal family are regulars while Princess Diana was also on the books. Kate’s mother Carole Middleton is also understood to have visited.

Appointments can last anything from an hour to an entire day. One of the most popular requests is Mr Ferretti’s signature ‘Method’ haircut.

He uses hand-made texturising scissors to achieve what is described as ‘the invisible haircut’, taking weight out of the hair without compromising length.

Mr Ferretti, who counts Hollywood actresses Angelina Jolie and Salma Hayek among his famous clientele, has been cutting hair since he was 18. He now owns 20 salons around the world at locations including Beverly Hills, Milan and the Maldives.

Given the newly lustrous appearance of Kate’s locks – which she showed off on Thursday night at a charity ball for the charity SportAid - it seems as though Rossano Ferretti could be tending to the most famous tresses in the country for some time yet.

A spokesman for the hairdresser declined to comment last night.
