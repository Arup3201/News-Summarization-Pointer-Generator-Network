Clint Eastwood, the star of the Super Bowl's most controversial TV ad, has denied the Chrysler spot was a booster for President Obama's re-election campaign. 

The ad, which declares 'it's halftime in America,' has received mounting criticism from Republicans, who say it was a thinly-veiled nod to President Obama, who bailed out the auto industry during the recession. 

The ad was subject to additional 
backlash today after it emerged that it wasn't even filmed in Detroit at
all -  but in New Orleans and Los Angeles.

'Halftime in America': Clint Eastwood leads a cast of major celebrities featuring in this year's Super Bowl ads

'l am certainly not politically affiliated with Mr Obama,' Eastwood told Fox News Monday.

'It was meant to be a message about just about job growth and the spirit of America. I think all politicians will agree with it.'

In a short statement to the network, the 81-year-old actor and director said he believed the ad was being 'spun' by political partisans, though that was never the intention of the clip.

The comments come as it was revealed the ad, which speaks prominently of the hardship in Detroit was not even filmed in the Motor City. 

The news was reminiscent of the
Jennifer Lopez controversy in November, when it was discovered that the
singer was featured in a Fiat commercial set in her hometown of the 
Bronx, New York - but in reality, she never left Los Angeles to film her
part.

Chrysler spokeswoman Dianna Gutierrez told the Weekly Standard that Mr Eastwood's tunnel scenes were actually shot at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.

She added that stadium shots were done in New Orleans.

Among the goofy Super Bowl ads aimed 
at selling beer and Doritos, Chrysler's commercial stood out as the 
automaker sent the veteran actor to strike a serious chord with viewers.

Should NBC have been allowed to broadcast Clint Eastwood's politically-charged Super Bowl ad for Chrysler?

'People are out of work and they’re 
hurting. And they’re all wondering what they’re going to do to make a 
comeback. And we’re all scared, because this isn’t a game,' The
Dirty Harry star says in his trademark vocal growl. 'The people of 
Detroit know a little something about this. They almost lost everything.
But we all pulled together, now Motor City is fighting again.'

But on Monday Karl Rove, a former political adviser for President George W. Bush, told Fox News that he was 'offended' by the advertisement.

He said: “I'm a huge fan of Clint Eastwood, I thought it was an extremely well-done ad, but it is a sign of what happens when you have Chicago-style politics, and the president of the United States and his political minions are, in essence, using our tax dollars to buy corporate advertising'.

Another Republican pundit, Michelle Malkin, took to Twitter to vent her rage, saying: 'Agh. WTH? Did I just see Clint Eastwood fronting an auto bailout ad???'

Mr Eastwood stepped into the shoes left vacant by rapper Eminem, who delivered his own Motor City unity speech for Chrysler last year.

The ad drew praise from the Obama camp.

White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer tweeted: 'Saving the America Auto Industry: Something Eminem and Clint Eastwood can agree on'.

Last year, the Treasury Department reported that taxpayers likely lost up to $1.3billion in the Chrysler.

However, the agency touted the finding as a ‘major accomplishment,’ as the government originally predicted that the government would lose $40billion on the deal, CNN reported.

Criticism: Despite what may be perceived as political undertones in the ad, Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne insisted the ad has 'zero political content'

Despite what may be perceived as 
political undertones in the ad, Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne insisted 
the ad has 'zero political content'.

Before 'Halftime in America,' Chrysler was in the Super Bowl ad business last year with a two-minute commercial starring rapper Eminem.

The ad, which was set over Eminem's anthem Lose Yourself from the film 8 Mile put him and his hometown in the national spotlight.

In 2011, Chrysler was trying to reinforce itself as a luxury brand in the year’s biggest advertising showcase.

CEO Sergio Marchionne said that the automaker purchased the ad in an effort to convince people that the company has changed.

He didn't give an exact cost but said Chrysler paid less than $9 million for the ad.

Mr Marchionne added: 'We are as 
apolitical as you can make us... and I sincerely hope that it doesn't 
get utilized as political fodder in a debate.

Mr Eastwood himself is no stranger to the political fray.

He served as an unaffiliated mayor of Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, from 1986 to 1988, and has contributed to both Republican and Democratic causes over the years.

The ad is sure to ignite tensions on the 2012 campaign trail, as Obama can hold it up as a triumph for the controversial bailouts he authorised for Chrysler and GM three years ago.

But it could come back to bite Republican frontrunner Mitt Romney, who argued in November that the bailouts in his home state of Michigan, were the 'wrong way to go'.

Mr Eastwood joined a class that included comedian Jerry Seinfeld, actor Matthew Broderick and Victoria's Secret model Adriana Lima (twice!) who took turns in various TV spots aimed at selling products ranging from cars to Doritos.
