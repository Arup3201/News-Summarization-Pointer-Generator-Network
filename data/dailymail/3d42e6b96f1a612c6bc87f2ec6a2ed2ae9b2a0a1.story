A crime  boss and his henchmen have been jailed for 17 years between them after marching to a rival's family home armed with imitation guns and baseball bats.

A mother and two children ran upstairs and screamed after they saw 41-year-old Simon Thirlwall Senior and his associates driving in convoy to their house in Guisborough, Teesside.

The revenge attack was the climax of a string of spats between Thirwall and  Sidney Kellam Hodgson, which saw Thirwall threaten to kill his rival and 'take his head off', Teesside Crown Court heard.

Henchmen: Steven Bremner (left) was jailed for four years and David Richardson (right) was jailed for two years and eight months. Teesside Crown Court heard they were 'recruited' by the crime boss

Thirwall and his son Aaron, 22, were both jailed yesterday alongside two men he recruited for the attack, 23-year-old Steven Bremner and 25-year-old David Richardson.

The court heard the Thirlwall family was part of an 'organised crime group' and the four defendants had 167 previous offences between them.

They had amassed tens of thousands of pounds without working or claiming benefits.

The gang believed the Hodgson family had been 'bad-mouthing' them and there was a string of 'tit-for-tat exchanges' at homes on both sides, said prosecutor Richard Bennett.

In one skirmish Thirlwall senior had threatened to kill Mr Hodgson and 'take his head off', while Bremner had brandished an axe and pointed a gun, threatening: 'You’re going in the ground.'

The tensions reached their peak on the night of October 7 last year, when the gang drove in convoy in a bid to find Mr Hodgson at his home.

Mr Hodgson’s partner ran upstairs to protect her children when she saw about 10 men running to the house, the court was told.

Simon Thirlwall and Bremner carried realistic imitation firearms while Aaron Thirlwall had a baseball bat, the court heard.

Mr Bennett said the front door was forced open and Simon Thirlwall came in shouting: 'Where is he? I’m going to kill him'.

Aaron Thirlwall smashed windows and men searched the house while the children screamed.

Simon Thirlwall then chased Mr Hodgson into the nearby hills in a black Range Rover, the court heard, and rammed his BMW X5.

The four then drove home, later dumping a white Transit van, a knife-axe, machete and clothes.

Following the attack, the gang members fled Teesside after retrieving £69,000 in cash which they had hidden under a paving slab behind Aaron Thirlwall's home.

Officers traced them and discovered imitation shotguns, a Samurai sword and a knuckleduster-handled knife in bins near their houses.

Simon Thirlwall was arrested at a Leeds hotel with £49,415 in wet and dirty notes in a bin bag four days later. Police also found £1,015 cash in a caravan where he had been lying low.

Aaron Thirlwall, meanwhile, was caught hiding £18,890 in a wardrobe.

All four men admitted violent disorder and the Thirlwall two also admitted money-laundering. 

Michael Bosomworth, defending Simon Thirlwall, said the trouble arose out of a misunderstanding about an overheard insult.

His client went 'tooled up' to 'scare the hell' out of Mr Hodgson, but now regretted his crime.

All four men still denied going in the house, the court heard, but Mr Bosomworth said: 'There is no place, whatever the motivation, in any society let alone a quiet place like Guisborough for this sort of gang activity.'

Nigel Soppitt, for Aaron Thirlwall, said he did not accept the court's version of events that he had a bat and 'didn’t do a great deal'. 

The dad-of-three was hoping to work offshore and become a good role model to his three children, one of whom was born while he was remanded in custody, the court heard.

Dan Cordey, representing Bremner, said he had gained qualifications in prison and was determined to lead a decent, law-abiding life.

Rod Hunt, for Richardson, said he had led a 'feckless' life and proved a drunk and 'not very good' henchman, leaving his own blood at the scene and in the van. 

Judge Simon Bourne-Arton QC jailed Simon Thirlwall, from Guisborough, for six years.

He told him: 'It was you who recruited the others.

'You are undoubtedly the head of a criminal organisation. You clearly make money from serious crime.'

Convicted drug dealer Aaron Thirlwall, also from Guisborough, was jailed for four years and five months.

Bremner, a convicted heroin dealer from Grangetown who had been out of prison for just three days, was jailed for four years.

Richardson, from nearby Eston, was jailed for two years and eight months. 

The case could only be reported after the end of a wounding trial involving Mr Hodgson. 

Judge Bourne-Arton added: 'You four went around to Mr Hodgson’s house mob-handed and with a determination to exact revenge and violence upon him.

'It matters not what the complaint was that you had against him, what manner of man he is or was.

'The court will not tolerate the actions of criminals seeking to bring their grievances out on to the street.

'Either this was all about your criminal activity, as I suspect, or over something of a slight which is of no consequence whatsoever. It matters not.'

He added: 'You were completely driven by your own pursuit of revenge.'
