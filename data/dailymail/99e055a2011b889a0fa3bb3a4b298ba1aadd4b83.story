Jane Fonda, two-time Oscar winner, has put her Forked Lightning ranch on sale for $19.5 million, saying that she no longer has time to enjoy the property

In the market to buy a ranch? This sprawling New Mexico desert oasis can be yours today... if you have $19.5 million to pony up.

Forked Lightning Ranch, located in Santa Fe, has belonged Oscar-winning actress Jane Fonda since 2000, when she purchased it to satisfy her demands for privacy and luxury. She has called the ranch 'an enchanted place.'

The exquisite beauty of the home's interior is matched only by the jaw-dropping environment that surrounds it, with views of mountains, rivers, and canyons all nearby.

Fonda, 76, says that she is selling the property because, due to her careful balance of life and work, she can no longer make enough time to enjoy the property.

Fonda was last seen on screen in the HBO drama 'The Newsroom,' which stars Jeff Daniels and Emily Mortimer. She also released a book in March 2014, her third.

'Forked Lightning Ranch has been a sanctuary and a place of great joy and recreation for me and my family,' says Fonda. 'Many changes have occurred in my life since 2000 and I am no longer able to spend as much time on the Ranch as I once was. I feel the time has come to pass the Ranch on to a new custodian of this enchanted place.'

The actress of such notable films as 'Nine To Five' with Dolly Parton and 'Fun With Dick and Jane' with George SegalÂ  redeveloped the 9,585 square foot main home, known as River House.

The ranch also includes the Hacienda - a 2,125 square-foot guest home, a 3,409 square-foot Log House, a 12-stall Equestrian Facility as well as a gym.

According to estate agents Swan Land Company, Fonda took 'great care' restoring a three-and-a-half mile stretch of a trout-rich Pecos River, one of the finest fisheries in New Mexico, that bisects the ranch.

The estate is on the boundary to the north and east of 311,040 acres of the Pecos National Forest which is part of the 1,558,452 acre Santa Fe National Forest and is 25 miles from the main city.

The Pecos River Valley served as a natural spot for those traveling between the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, the southernmost extension of the Rockies, and the Great Plains.

The ranch even boasts of evidence of the wagon route that once passed through the boundaries of the property, where pioneering homesteaders and military traveled. Their tracks still mark the eastern property boundary of the Ranch.

Mike Swan, owner and managing broker, said: 'We are honored to be the brokerage representing this significant piece of New Mexico's history.'

'This ranch is unparalleled in its offering of elegant living combined with carefully guarded wilderness, a fine trout fishery and proximity to Santa Fe, one of the country's most sophisticated, culturally-rich and oldest capital cities,' said Swan.

Fonda won two Academy Award in the 1970s, the first for the murder mystery 'Klute', co-starring Donald Sutherland in 1971. She received her second Oscar in 1978 for 'Coming Home', a love-triangle drama co-starring Jon Voight.

Fonda also enjoyed success in the 1980s with her series of workout tapes. Beginning in 1982 with 'Jane Fonda's Workout,' she produced 11 workout videotapes which sold very well. Her original tape became the highest-selling home video for years after its release.

Fonda retired from acting in the 1990s, only to return in 2005 with 'Monster-in-Law', a movie co-starring Jennifer Lopez. While the movie received negative reviews, it was successful at the box office.

According to Swan Land Company, Fonda's extensive personal collection of antiques, artwork, rugs, furniture and her literary collection at River House are available for purchase as well as the ranch equipment and machinery.

The real estate firm says that prices of the property additional to the ranch will be negotiable.

A complete inventory of personal property and ranch equipment is available by contacting Swan Land Company. The company is based in Bozeman, Montana.
