New York City FC have revealed their kits for next year's MLS, and they take on a very familiar tone.

The club, owned by Manchester City and the New York Yankees, have adopted sky blue to their adidas strip, a striking resemblance to the current City jersey.

Unveiled at New York's Terminal 5 venue on Thursday, the strip has an 'inaugural season' logo at the bottom, commemorating what will be a landmark campaign for the American club.

Chief business officer Tim Pernetti said: 'This is a milestone day for New York City Football Club.

'Our first home jersey is a huge part of our identity and we are proud that our kit and our team will be so strongly associated with a partner of the caliber of Etihad Airways.

'Today will be remembered as one of our most significant landmark moments as we build towards our historic inaugural season, due to kick off this coming March.

The club's Twitter feed expands on the features of the strip, including a commemorative logo

'This is just the first day of what we firmly believe will be a lasting and fruitful relationship, both for New York City Football Club and for Etihad Airways.

'We cannot wait to start working together to provide a fantastic experience for New Yorkers.'

The club intends to begin playing in the 2015 MLS season at Yankee Stadium in the New York City borough of the Bronx.
