A leisurely stroll along a Florida beach threw up an elephant-sized opportunity for Todd Unbehagen to take a glorious and very unusual selfie.

Capturing the huge creature wading knee-deep off the shores of Gulf Coast Redington Beach on Saturday, Unbehagen joined dozens of other perplexed onlookers in wondering just how an elephant had managed to end up there.

The amusing picture spread across social media and the lady responsible for the gentle giant's appearance over the weekend has come forward to explain why she rented Judy the elephant and how, amazingly, it was completely legal.

Claudia McCorkle was five-years-old when she turned down the chance to ride an elephant 55-years ago in Fort Lauderdale.

She never got over that regret and decided in February that when she celebrated her 60th birthday party on Saturday that she would pay $4,500 to enjoy four hours in the company of Judy the elephant.

'Elephants are so symbolic,' said Claudia McCorkle to Tampa Bay News.

'Symbolic of karma and such wonderful qualities as loyalty and love, memory and longevity.'

Deciding to stun her guests with Judy, Claudia contacted Orlando based party specialists, Xtreme Entertainment to rent the 58-year-old elephant.

Indeed, despite common sense dictating that some laws may have been broken in carting an elephant to a quiet Gulf Coast beach on a weekend, it turns out that the city commission was well aware and had approved.

Back in February, McCorkle registered her special request to have Judy and the city commission even allowed her an empty lot to move the elephant from Gulf Boulevard to North Redington.

Obviously, for the successful realtor, it helps if you know the town mayor, especially if he is to be a guest at the party.

'Mayor Nick Simons referred to the letter from Claudia McCorkle and her request to be able to have an elephant on her beach property for a birthday party,' city meeting minutes from February read.

'Motion passed with all ayes.'

Judy, who weighs, 6,200 pounds, also gave rides to some of the 40 guests as a pianist played the Elephant Walk inside McCorkle's beachfront home.

Judy elephant waded in around sunset, and her presence stunned other beach-goers.

Mr. Unbehagen was with his family when he shot the video and selfie.

'We were walking down the beach, and someone had a private party at their beach house with an elephant. It was at North Redington Beach, Florida. So, we stopped for a while to take pictures. You don't see this every day!!!"which he later posted to Facebook.'

Born in Thailand, Judy's trainer Bones Craig said that she loves the ocean.

'There's days that she seems to like it and days that she doesn't,' said Bones, who has owned Judy since 1977.
