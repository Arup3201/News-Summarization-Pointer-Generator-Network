A transgender teacher is suing a Catholic prep school claiming he was discriminated against and branded 'worse than gay' before his employment was terminated.

Mark Krolikowski, 59, taught at St Francis Preparatory School, a 150-year-old Catholic institution in Queens, New York, for 32 years.

But in August last year the school laid him off. Eight months earlier he told authorities he was transgender following a complaint by a parent.

Mr Krolikowski alleges he was discriminated against and that the school's attitude toward him changed after he came out.

Mr Krolikowski has filed a lawsuit saying the school and its principal, Leonard Conway, broke the law with his termination and that as a result, Krolikowski has been distressed.

'Teaching - it's my life,' Mr Krolikowski told CNN. 'I feel that has been taken away from me.'

His lawyer Andrew Kimler said Mr Krolikowski's case has 'significant ramifications for the LGBT community and is a wake-up call to employers in terms of employment practices.'

Conway would not comment but referred questions to his lawyer, Philip Semprevivo Jr.

Mr Semprevivo said he could not discuss details of the case since it was in litigation but said Mr Krolikowski's contract was terminated legally.

'We deny all the allegations,' he said.

Mr Krolikowski says he started being treated like a pariah after a parent became suspicious of his long hair and fancy nails and went to school bosses with her concerns in August last year

Former students of St Francis have launched an online petition that describes Mr Krolikowski as a beloved and well-respected teacher and urges the school to apologise.

Cristina Guarino, who started the petition on Change.org, said Mr Krolikowski always had a 'feminine edge,' though it was nothing shocking.

'I really never questioned his gender identity despite his somewhat feminized looks,' she said. 'It just didn't seem to matter, and it never affected his teaching style or his opinions. He never imposed anything on us.'

She told CNN Mr Krolikowski's sex education class called Human Sexuality and Love was one of her favorites during her four years at St Francis.

Mr Krolikowski's gender identity never was an issue in class, she said. He was the kind of teacher who told jokes and acted silly in class to make students feel more comfortable talking about sex.

'Teaching - it's my life. I feel that has been taken away from me.'

'I still laugh to this day when I remember it. Mr. K was someone who brightened our lives,' Miss Guarino said.

Mr Krolikowski said he was overwhelmed by the show of support from his students.

'I didn't realize I touched that many people,' he said. 'It makes me feel that my teaching career was worthwhile.'

Mr Krolikowski said in the lawsuit that after he came out he was asked whether he would 'appear as a woman' in the next school year and was told that he was 'worse than gay.'

The school officials then allegedly told Mr Krolikowski that he could not be seen at public events.

The teacher wanted to remain at the school and said he would 'tone down' his appearance by removing his earrings and French manicure.

The lawsuit states that Mr Krolikowski was unlawfully discriminated against because he did not conform to the school's perception of how a male should dress and act.

'His appearance hasn't changed very much, so no one understands why this happened,' Miss Guarino said. 'It wasn't an issue for 32 years. Why is it a problem now? It seemed very sudden.'

The termination, the lawsuit says, violates New York state and city law.

New York state's human rights law states that an employer cannot discharge an employee because of 'an individual's age, race, creed, color, national origin, sexual orientation, military status, sex, disability, predisposing genetic characteristics, marital status, or domestic violence victim status.'
