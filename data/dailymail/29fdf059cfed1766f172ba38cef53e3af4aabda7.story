Having made her name as a young and attractive starlet, you might expect Cameron Diaz to dread the ageing process.

But the actress says she ‘can’t wait to be older’ as she believes women over 40 get the best parts.

The 41-year-old says British stars Helen Mirren and Judi Dench and American Meryl Streep have demonstrated actresses become more successful as they age.

Cameron Diaz has said woman are pressured into trying to 'defy nature' and look young, even as they get older

She said: ‘[This] is the best time of my life. I love being this age. I can’t wait to be older. The most interesting parts are for women who are over 40. We don’t see it that way, because they’re not the sexy parts.

‘We’re not giving those women enough credit for what they’re accomplishing, which is beautiful performances.’

Miss Diaz, who recently published The Body Book - a lifestyle guide aimed at helping women be more comfortable with their bodies - has previously said it's 'crazy' how women are pressured to look young, even as they are maturing.

She said women 'don’t give ourselves permission to age gracefully’ and that they are constantly told they have to ‘defy nature’.

The actress has previously given into this pressure, having botox treatment to try and remain fresh faced but afterwards spoke out about how it changed her face in a 'weird way' and that she regretted her decision.

She has also been open about her long-term battle with acne and how she had plastic surgery on her nose after breaking it four times.

Miss Diaz found fame in the 1990s in comedies including The Mask, There’s Something About Mary and My Best Friend’s Wedding.

Despite a string of high-profile relationships, including with actors Justin Timberlake and Jared Leto, she has never married or had children.
