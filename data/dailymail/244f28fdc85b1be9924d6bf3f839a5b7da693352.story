With their parents in the sea catching fish, thousands of junior emperor penguins are left huddled together to await dinner.

But when their food-bearing parents return they may be presented with one slight problem - how to find their chick amongst the mass of youngsters.

Despite the thousands of youngsters crowded together on this plain in South Georgia, the parents are incredibly able to locate their youngsters by detecting their individual calls.

The young birds, displaying their 
brown, downy feathers, crowd together to keep warm while their parents 
leave en masse to fetch food.

Photographer Mike Reyfman travelled to the frozen wilderness for the first time to witness the huge gathering.

He
said: 'There must be 100,000s of birds in these nurseries but each 
chick can be spotted by their mum or dad when they return with food 
simply by the sound of their voice.

'Penguin
babies are gathered like this to keep warm from the extreme cold and 
because they cannot go out to sea yet as their feathers are not 
ready.

Mr Reyfman, 52, from Chicago, added: 'We spent two days following the flock and it was one the most incredible experiences of my life.'

He used a Nikon D4 to capture his images.
