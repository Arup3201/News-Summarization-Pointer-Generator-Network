Video games and computers from the 1970s to 1990s including Atari's Pong, pictured, will be on display at the Barbican museum in London from July

If you remember the likes of Tetris, the early games console ZX Spectrum and were among the first to use the web, prepare to feel very old.

An upcoming exhibition being held at the Barbican in London is relegating these retro childhood favourites to the world of 'digital archaeology.'

Video games and computers from the 1970s to 1990s including Space Invaders, Pong, the Gameboy, Mac Paint and the Linn LM-1 drum machine will be on display at the museum from July.

The Digital Revolution exhibition has been designed as a 'celebration of digital creativity.'

All the models are in working condition and will be available to play as part of the exhibition, which tracks their respective places in technological history. 

Other examples include Manic Miner on the ZX Spectrum and the first website to be created by pioneer Tim Berners-Lee in 1991.

In May, researchers restored this early website that Berners-Lee created during his time a the European Organization for Nuclear Research, known as CERN.

It outlined the basics of what would become the web we know today.

The Digital Archaeology display is the part of a wider exhibition looking at the impact of digital technology over the past 40 years.

Tetris was first released in June 1984 for consoles and arcades and became popular in 1989 when it was made available on the handheld Nintendo Game Boy.

The Digital Archaeology display is the part of a wider exhibition looking at the impact of digital technology over the past 40 years. This includes Tetris, pictured, first released in June 1984 for consoles and arcades. It became popular in 1989 when it was made available on the handheld Nintendo Game Boy

The aim of the game is to stack the different shaped Tetriminos together to complete rows, these completed rows then disappear. Once the rows reach the top of the screen, the game ends.

It was voted the 'Greatest Game of All Time' by Electronic Gaming Monthly magazine and a digital version is now sold for phones and tablets.

Pong is a 2D arcade table tennis game. Paddle's are moved along the sides of the screen to hit a moving 'ball' back and forth. The player who scores the most points wins. 

It was the first game to be designed by computer maker Atari in 1972 and was originally created as a programming training exercise.

Space Invaders is an arcade video game created by Tomohiro Nishikado in 1978. It is a 2D 'fixed shooter game' and the aim is to shoot aliens using a laser on a cannon at the bottom of the screen.

Also on display in the Digital Revolution exhibition is the the Roger Linn LM-1 drum machine, pictured. The first song featuring an LM-1 to reach number one in UK charts was the Human League's 'Don't You Want Me', in 1981. It has also been used in by Peter Gabriel, Fleetwood Mac, and Stevie Wonder

The cannon can be moved from left to right and the game ends if the rows of aliens reach the bottom of the screen.

Pac-Man, developed by Namco, was initially released in Japan in 1980. A player moves Pac-Man through a maze, eating pac-dots. When all dots, or pellets, are eaten, the player advances to the next stage.

Ghosts chase Pac-Man around the screen and if the player hits an enemy, they lose a life. Google created a playable Pac-Man doodle in February last year that let people play an online version of the game in their browser.

The Magic Miner platform game was created by Atari's rival console, the ZX Spectrum in 1983, while Mac Paint was an early photos and graphics editor available for early Macintosh computers from 1984.

The LM-1 Drum Computer was designed by engineer Roger Linn.

The first song featuring an LM-1 to reach number one in UK charts was the Human League's 'Don't You Want Me', in 1981. It has also been used in by Peter Gabriel, Fleetwood Mac, and Stevie Wonder, who bought one of the first machines ever made.

According to the release: 'Digital Revolution explores and celebrates the transformation of the arts through digital technology since the 1970s.'

It 'brings together for the first 
time a range of artists, filmmakers, architects, designers, musicians 
and game developers pushing the boundaries of their fields using digital
media.

Other examples include the first website to be created by pioneer Tim Berners-Lee in 1991, pictured. In May, researchers restored this early website. It outlined the basics of what would become the web we know today

'It also looks to the future 
considering the impact of creative coding, DIY culture, digital 
communities and the creative possibilities offered by technologies 
including augmented reality, artificial
intelligence, wearable technologies and 3-D printing.'

Elsewhere in the exhibition, the Creative Spaces display looks at visual effects used in films such as Inception, Man of Steel, Dark Knight Rises and Rush.

While the Sound and Vision display showcases how musicians have experimented with digital technology, including new music from will.i.am.

The exhibition runs from July to September 2014 at the Barbican museum in London.
