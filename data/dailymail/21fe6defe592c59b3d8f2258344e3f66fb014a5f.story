Everton manager Roberto Martinez believes the loan signing of Chelsea forward Christian Atsu will add another dimension to his attacking options.

The Spaniard is hopeful the deal to bring the 22-year-old to Goodison Park will be concluded by Thursday.

Atsu's arrival would supplement the resources Martinez already has at his disposal, led by marquee summer signing Romelu Lukaku - also from Chelsea.

Striker Arouna Kone is still at least a month away from fully recovering from a knee injury which kept him out for most of last season while Kevin Mirallas, like his Belgium team-mate Lukaku, is still getting up to speed having returned to training later than many of his team-mates due to his World Cup commitments.

Steven Naismith is another alternative up front or off the right but Ghana international Atsu will give Everton something extra in the same way Barcelona forward Gerard Deulofeu did in his loan spell last season.

'We are hoping that the deal can be formalised and finalised by Thursday,' Martinez told evertontv.

'That would be a really good positive move to boost the squad. How ready he will be to have him in the team, it's too early to tell but we want Christian to be part of the squad as soon as we can.

'We are really excited and are desperate to welcome him to Finch Farm (training ground) to allow him to feel the Everton way quickly.

'Christian is a experienced young man and to be that experienced at a young age is incredible. 

'He had a really good spell in Portugal then a big move and has played a lot of games in Holland. Playing in a World Cup with Ghana will give him a lot too.

'He can play on both wings, play through the middle and has appreciation of space.

'Technically he is very gifted and will fit extremely well. He has the hunger and desire to want to show what he can do in the Premier League and we feel we are ready to give him that opportunity.'
