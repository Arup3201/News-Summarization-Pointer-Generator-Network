A Massachusetts prepared foods manufacturer has yanked 7 tons of hummus from store shelves over fears it's contaminated with the potentially deadly bacteria listeria.

Lansal Inc, commonly known as Hot Mama's Foods, said it would voluntarily pull hummus and dip products sold at Target, Trader Joe's and other retailers, the administration said.

Lansal launched the recall of about 14,860 pounds of hummus after a single 10-ounce container of Target Archer Farms Traditional Hummus surveyed by the Texas Department of Health tested positive for listeria, the administration said.

Nuts: The St. Louis-based Sherman Produce Co. has also recalled 241 cases of bulk walnuts over fears of the same potentially deadl pathogen

In a seperate case, a Missouri company has recalled a large quantity of its nuts because of the same pathogen, the FDA said in a statement

St. Louis-based Sherman Produce Co said it would begin recalling 241 cases of bulk walnuts, after a recent routine sampling of the product purchased by stores in Missouri and Illinois revealed traces of listeria.

Listeria monocytogenes can lead to serious, even fatal, infections especially in young children, the elderly and those with weakened immune systems. Infections can have particularly harmful effects for pregnant women, including miscarriage and stillbirths.

No illnesses tied to the Sherman Produce walnuts or Lansal hummus products have been reported, the FDA said.

The agency urged purchasers of the products to 'dispose of them or return them to the place of purchase for a full refund.'
