Emergency drug laws are being rushed through in Ireland after possession of ecstasy was temporarily legalised as a result of a court striking down a ban on another substance.

Parliamentarians will sit into the night to pass legislation quickly after the Court of Appeal's ruling temporarily makes legal the possession of the party drug, along with benzodiazepines and some so-called head shop drugs.

Health minister Leo Varadkar said he is working to pass the emergency laws within 24 hours. 'We had no way of knowing what the court would decide today, but we prepared for this possibility,' he said.

The possession of ecstasy is temporarily legal in Ireland because of the knock-on effect caused by a Court of Appeal ruling striking down a ban on methylethcathinone

The move was necessary after a decision by the Court of Appeal on a challenge to the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977. The case dealt with the powers of the Government to control substances harmful to human health.

The three-judge court unanimously said a regulation making the possession of methylethcathinone - also known as 4-mec or snow blow - illegal was invalid.

Because of the way the laws are drawn up, the ruling had the knock-on effect of temporarily legalising the possession of some other drugs.

The Dublin government said the outcome of the case did not affect existing laws on heroin, cocaine or cannabis.

While the case dealt with the legality of possession of named substances, their sale and supply remains an offence.

'Legislation was prepared and approved in advance by cabinet,' said Mr Varadkar.

'The emergency legislation I am introducing today will re-instate the status quo and re-control all drugs that were controlled prior to this judgment.'

Irish health minister for Health Leo Varadkar is working to pass the emergency laws within 24 hours. 'We had no way of knowing what the court would decide today, but we prepared for this possibility,' he said
