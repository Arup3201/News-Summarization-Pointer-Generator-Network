Bogus travel agent Jessica Scutt, 27 scammed at least 13 families into paying for caravan holidays in Welsh resorts that did not exist

At least 13 families were scammed by a bogus travel agent who charged them for caravan holidays that didn’t exist.

27-year-old Jessica Scutt was today jailed for eight months for inventing trips to Welsh seaside resorts on websites including Gumtree.

She charged £220 for a 'package holiday' that included free trips to theme parks and a gym membership.

Scutt used pictures of other people's
caravans and shots of picturesque resorts like Tenby and Pendine in 
West Wales, to entice families.

The 27-year-old, of Ynysddu, Caerphilly, South Wales, is said to have preyed on young families who were looking for affordable holidays at home.

Prosecuting lawyer, Mark Salter described some of Scutt's victims.

'Five 
children aged ten, seven, six, two and one were looking forward to their
first ever seaside break,' he said.

'Their mother had seen an enticing advert for a week's caravan holiday for £160 plus a
£60 deposit.

'The family did not have a lot of money to spare - £220 was a lot of money to them.

'When they arrived at the camp site the children were left in tears because there was no caravan there for them.

'They had to drive all the way home again.'

She was sentenced today at Caerphilly Magistrates Court, Glamorgan and ordered to pay £2,575 compensation to her victims.

She was condemned by Chairman of Caerphilly magistrates Ronald Coldbourne, who said her actions were appalling.

'These are some of the most despicable cases I have come across for fraud,' he said.

Seaside resort Tenby, in West Wales, was advertised by Stutt online as one of the destinations of her package holidays, which included entry into amusement parks and membership to a local gym

The 27-year-old was today jailed for eight months and will pay £2,575 compensation to her victims. She is said to have set up the scam to put down a deposit on a house

'While you are in prison I hope you have time to think about all the pain you have caused families.'

Scutt was ordered to pay £2,575 compensation to her victims.

Officers caught Scutt by tracing an e-mail address she gave to one of her victims.

She
is said to have set up the phoney travel business so she afford a 
deposit on a new house after being threatened with eviction by her 
landlord.

Scutt's family have disowned her, saying they are disgusted by her actions.

Before she was caught, her sister Samantha apologised to her victims on a website dedicated to exposing fraudsters.

She said: 'I am so sorry for what she has done to all of you - If I can help catch her in any way I will.

'Our family is disgusted with what she has done, we no longer have any contact with her.

'She has a track record of deceiving and stealing from people.

'She has stolen off all of our family and even my own daughter.

'Please if the police or fraud team need any information please don't hesitate to message me.

'Once again, I am so sorry.'
