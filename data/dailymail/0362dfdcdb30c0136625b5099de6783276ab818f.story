Change: Culture Secretary Maria Miller wants to reduce the abortion limit to 20 weeks

David Cameron’s new Minister for Women called yesterday for a change in the abortion laws to reduce the deadline for terminations.

Culture Secretary Maria Miller, who is also in charge of women’s issues and equalities policy, said the legal limit for abortions should be cut from 24 weeks to 20.

She said advances in medical science mean many very premature babies can now be saved.

The Tory MP, a mother of three, first voted for the change in 2008 when it was put forward in a backbench Bill by Tory MP Nadine Dorries.

Asked yesterday whether she still believed the reduction was necessary, she replied: ‘Absolutely. You have got to look at these matters in a commonsense way.

‘I looked at it from the really important stance of the impact on women and children.’

Mrs Miller, who described herself as ‘a very modern feminist’, said she was ‘driven by the very practical impact that late-term abortion has on women’.

She added: ‘What we are trying to do here is not to put obstacles in people’s way but to reflect the way medical science has moved on.’

Pro-abortion campaigners argue that few terminations are carried out after 20 weeks, usually on medical grounds. They see the drive to lower the deadline as an attack on wider abortion rights.

They are already angry at the appointment as Health Secretary last month of Jeremy Hunt, who has voted for the abortion limit to be reduced to 12 weeks in the past.

Darinka Aleksic, of Abortion Rights, said: ‘The fact that the minister responsible for women and equalities wants to restrict access to abortion, one of the most important women’s health services, is really alarming.

‘Her appointment, alongside Jeremy Hunt at the Department of Health, who would like to see abortion severely restricted, does nothing to inspire confidence in the government’s commitment to women’s right to choose.’ In an interview before the last election, Mr Cameron also backed calls for the abortion limit to be lowered to 22 weeks or 20 to take account of medical advances.

The Department of Health stressed yesterday that it had ‘no plans’ to review the abortion laws, which are traditionally decided by votes of conscience in the Commons.

An aide to Mrs Miller also said she was not pressing for action on abortion within government, but merely restating her ‘strongly held view’.

But Mrs Dorries, who has led a series of attempts to change the abortion laws in recent years, said she would press for a fresh review this autumn.

She praised Mrs Miller for speaking out on the issue despite her ministerial position. ‘Maria Miller is very strong and very brave to speak out in this way.

‘Many ministers do not like to talk about the issue for fear of being targeted by pro-abortion campaigners, so I am delighted that she has made her views  very clear.

Mrs Dorries said the 24-week limit was ‘unsustainable’ now that babies born earlier than this can sometimes be saved.

‘The facts have not changed since the 2008 vote – the problem is that Parliament has so many socially liberal MPs that it has become completely out of touch with public opinion.’
