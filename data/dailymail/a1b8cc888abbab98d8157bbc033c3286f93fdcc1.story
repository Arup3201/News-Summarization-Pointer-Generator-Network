Everton face battle to keep Barry as Arsenal, Spurs and Monaco target on loan midfielder

Scouts from Liverpool, Chelsea and Tottenham are poised to watch Verona's Juan Iturbe on Monday, but they will be awaiting to see if he shakes off a thigh injury first.

The brilliant Argentinian winger is on loan from Porto but Verona are to take up the option to buy him at the end of the season and then will consider selling quickly at a profit such is their need for money.

Iturbe has been described as the 'next Lionel Messi' owing to his diminutive stature, pace and dribbling style. Although born in Buenos Aires, he was brought up in Paraguay but has switched allegiance back to Argentina and is being considered by clubs now before his price escalates further.

Iturbe has scored six goals this season and his wing play has had a major bearing on veteran Luca Toni's revival with the 36-year-old now second in Italy's goalscoring charts with 19 goals.

However, Iturbe picked up a bruised thigh barely 30 minutes into last weekend's 4-0 win over Catania and is a doubt for Monday and scouts may reschedule for their game with Udinese next Saturday.
