When Chelsea walk up Wembley Way on March 1, the smart money is on them leaving with the Capital One Cup. Why? Because Jose Mourinho is the specialist in finals. Eleven down, nine trophies is among the best records ever to have been accumulated in Europe’s elite.

You must tip your hat to the Portuguese given he’s managed it in four different countries, too. He is the man for the big occasion.

To have lost just two finals in his time as a manager is nothing short of remarkable, but the way in which he’s lifted those trophies gives an insight into just why his record is so impressive.

Jose Mourinho is in another final after Chelsea beat Liverpool in the Capital One Cup on Tuesday night

Almost 50 per cent of these finals have gone to extra-time, including his first-ever trophy in the UEFA Cup against Celtic.

It points to a boss who is insistent on definitely not losing, with his team invariably coming out on top, indicating their superior fitness levels as well.

2003 – UEFA Cup (Porto 3-2 Celtic AET)

On a Seville night heaped in drama, Porto twice blew a lead against Martin O’Neill’s Celtic before Bobo Balde’s extra-time sending off saw Dmitri Alenichev clinch a late winner and Mourinho’s first piece of silverware in European competition.

2003 – Taca de Portugal (Porto 1-0 UD Leiria)

The UEFA Cup success was to be followed by a triumph in Portugal’s main cup competition a month later – Mourinho’s first domestic trophy of what would become a glittering career. Derlei scored the only goal against UD Leiria – the club he’d left just a year previous.

2004 – Taca de Portugal (Porto 1-2 Benfica AET)

The only major final Mourinho lost in 10 years, Porto blew a lead through Derlei and eventually succumbed to Simao in extra-time at the Estadio Nacional.

2004 – Champions League (Porto 3-0 Monaco)

The Portuguese’s crowning moment as manager of Porto. Mourinho could barely drink in the monumental achievement of winning the Champions League because his mind was already on other things – namely joining the Roman Abramovich revolution at Chelsea. They swept Monaco aside with embarrassing ease; Carlos Alberto (no, not that one), Deco and Alenichev scored the goals.

2005 - League Cup (Chelsea 3-2 Liverpool AET)

The final to be remembered for that Steven Gerrard header through his own net at the Millennium Stadium – months before he turned Chelsea town to stay at Liverpool – was capped off by Mateja Kezman climbing off the bench to net a 112th-minute winner and get the trophy ball rolling for Mourinho at Stamford Bridge in his first season.

2007 – League Cup (Chelsea 2-1 Arsenal)

 Didier Drogba was simply unplayable, scoring twice to beat Arsenal. The game was remembered for the significant blow John Terry took to the face thanks to the boot of Abou Diaby.

2007 – FA Cup (Chelsea 1-0 Manchester United AET)

It was the year of Drogba, who completed Chelsea’s historic double with an extra-time winner against Manchester United at Wembley, poking underneath Edwin van der Sar. The Blues were slightly fortunate given Ryan Giggs had appeared to have scored earlier but referee Steve Bennett’s assistant adjudged that the ball had not crossed the line.

2010 – Coppa Italia (Inter Milan 1-0 Roma)

Success in Italy was largely down to the prolific season enjoyed by Diego Milito, whose only goal against Roma (in the Stadio Olimpico, by the way) sealed Mourinho’s first trophy at Inter. The first of three, including Serie A.

2010 – Champions League (Inter Milan 2-0 Bayern Munich)

This was classic Mourinho. They absorbed a fair amount of pressure against Louis van Gaal’s Bayern, Milito taking both his chances when they arose and the rest is history. As with his exit from Porto, a teary Jose departed the club after a Champions League victory.

2011 - Copa del Rey (Real Madrid 1-0 Barcelona AET)

Now this was sweet. In his first season as manager of the biggest club in the world, Mourinho beat arch rivals Barcelona in the Copa del Rey final thanks to his fellow countryman Cristiano Ronaldo. Interestingly, it was yet another goal coming in extra-time to seal it.

2013 – Copa del Rey (Real Madrid 1-2 Atletico Madrid)

If 2011 was sweet, this defeat saw Mourinho plunge to the depths of despair. An extra-time defeat at the hands of their city rivals Atletico – after Ronaldo had put Real into a 14th-minute lead, no less. It was the beginning of the end for the boss, who left for his second Chelsea spell soon after.
