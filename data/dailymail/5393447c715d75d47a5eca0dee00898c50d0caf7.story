With just days to go before the royal birth, the Duchess of Cornwall was seen picking up a box of organic baby food while on an official visit in Wales.

Camilla looked delighted as officials from baby food company, Plum, 
presented her with a large hamper during a visit to the Rhug Estate with her husband, the Prince of Wales.

But back in London, preparations of a different kind were taking place as St Mary's Hospital in Paddington readied itself for a surge in of royal fans and media by erecting a colossal press pen as well as steel barriers throughout the street.

Generous: The Finnish Government has sent the Cambridges a comprehensive maternity kit

The Duchess of Cambridge, 31, will give birth to the 
new third-in-line-to-the-throne in the private Lindo Wing, where Prince 
William was delivered in 1982, and anticipation is building as members of the press began arriving ahead of the birth.

To
 accommodate them, the hospital has built a press pen at a safe distance
 away on the other side of the street, with workmen seen putting the 
finishing touches to the uncomfortable-looking row of metal seats and 
ladders.

Back in Wales, the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall met excited locals as well as officials from the baby food manufacturer, who presented Camilla with the hamper.

Scott Wotherspoon, UK chief executive at Plum, said: 'We were absolutely delighted that Rhug has chosen to present the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall with some Plum baby food in which the main ingredients came from the Rhug Estate.

'As one of Britain's top baby food 
brands which has an exclusive and long-term relationship with Rhug 
Estate, we are on a mission to introduce fabulous organic recipes to 
babies and children at the earliest possible age, in a modern way, with 
convenient pouches.

'The 
development of superb quality and sustainable farmed organic British 
foods is a cause which is very close to the heart of the Prince of 
Wales.'

The box of baby 
treats should certainly come in handy when the new third in line to the 
throne is born, which could happen as early as next week.

As, no doubt, will a maternity box sent to the duke and duchess by the Finnish government.

The box, which doubles as a crib, includes a range of clothing including snowsuit, romper suits and leggings. It also includes bathing essentials such as a bath towel with hood, nail scissors, hairbrush, toothbrush, nappy cream, wash cloth

For baby, it has a cloth nappy set and muslin squares, a picture book and teething toy, and for mother and father, it has bra pads and condoms.

The BBC reports that the box, made by social services firm Kela, is given to all expectant mothers in Finland.

Kensington Palace has confirmed that the parents-to-be received the box last week and were 'delighted'.

The new prince or princess is thought to be due on the 12th July, and will be greeted by his or her grandmother, Carole Middleton, and father Prince William.

William is said to be determined to make it to the delivery suite, 
following in the footsteps of his own father who broke royal tradition 
to be with his wife, Diana, Princess of Wales, for the birth of both 
their children. Previous heirs have been born at home or Buckingham 
Palace.

After the Queen has been informed, the rest of the Royal Family - and the Middletons - will be told before the birth is announced using an easel positioned outside Buckingham Palace, although with the eyes of the world's press on St. Mary's, the news could come much sooner.
