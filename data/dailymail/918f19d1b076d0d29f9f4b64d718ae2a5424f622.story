Mobile conversations can be listened to or recorded and user's metadata can be tracked by government agencies

The world's second-largest mobile phone company has revealed how government agencies around the world use secret wires to listen in to private phone calls across its entire network.

Vodafone's Law Enforcement Disclosure Report, released on Friday, unveiled how direct-access wires or pipes were connected directly to its network. This allowed government authorities in some of the 29 countries it covers to monitor phone conversations and track users.

Although the report didn't release figures on Australia, recently collated data by The Guardian unveiled that Australian government agencies made 685,757 requests to access details about phone calls. This is known as metadata which can track the location of a device, the times and dates of the call and with whom they were made to last year.

They also listened to 3,389 calls from various Australian networks - not just Vodafone.

In the report, the phone company disclosed details on the widespread use of secret surveillance - including phone tapping - by government agencies, according to The Guardian.

While legal notices are required in Australia to access its network, Vodafone revealed that at least six unnamed governments can use its phone system to monitor customers whenever they want.

The company has called this direct access to be disconnected and for agencies to gain warrants if any surveillance is to be undertaken.

Stephen Deadman, Vodafone's group privacy officer, was quoted in the article: 'We are making a call to end direct access as a means of government agencies obtaining people's communication data.

'Without an official warrant, there is no external visibility. If we receive a demand we can push back against the agency. The fact that a government has to issue a piece of paper is an important constraint on how powers are used.'

Civil rights groups were horrified at the latest revelations, with some describing the practice as 'terrifying'.

Shami Chakrabarti, director of human rights campaign group Liberty, said: 'For governments to access phone calls at the flick of a switch is unprecedented and terrifying.

'(Edward) Snowden revealed the internet was already treated as fair game. Bluster that all is well is wearing pretty thin - our analogue laws need a digital overhaul.'

Gus Hosein, from Privacy International, said Vodafone had taken a 'brave step', calling the covert surveillance wires 'the nightmare scenarios that we were imagining'.
