A plastic surgeon has been indicted after he performed liposuction on a heart transplant survivor, authorities said on Thursday.

Dr Oleg Davie, from Brooklyn, New York, has been indicted on manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide charges in the death of Isel Pineda.

District Attorney Charles J. Hynes said that doctors are discouraged from performing liposuction on patients with heart disease. He alleges Davie 'recklessly' performed the procedure and falsified forms to conceal his knowledge of Pineda's medical history.

Tragic: Heart transplant survivor Isla Pineda died following the botched plastic surgery which she should have never been cleared for

Miss Pineda went into cardiac arrest in his office after the May 2012 procedure and died at Coney Island hospital.

The name of Davie's attorney was not immediately known.

Miss Pineda, a former model, should 
never have been on the operating table having had a heart transplant in 
in 2004. The major surgery made it unsafe for her to be given 
anesthesia. 

Davie, a disgraced 
plastic surgeon who was banned at the time from carrying out anything more invasive that 
wart removal or Botox, ignored Pineda's poor health history and 
performed lucrative 'SmartLipo' on her.

Paperwork found in Pineda's purse by her boyfriend suggested Davie knew about her heart disease and resulting life-saving operation that made her unsuitable for liposuction.

On it were details of the diagnosis and the anti-rejection rejection drugs she was taking.

Davies appeared to have ignored the health issues when filling out Pineda's patient history form, on which he clearly marked 'no' where it asks whether she had ever been hospitalized.

Lucrative: Pineda paid $3,200 for the procedure, described in online ads as being to 'lose the wobble'

He wrote that she had a 'mid-chest, old, well-healed' scar, describing it as resulting from 'skin surgery' to remove a 'cyst'.

Pineda's scar would have stretched from the neck to her navel.

While her family believe she didn't tell them she was having lipo due to embarrassment, she was never shy about discussing her heart transplant.

'Anyone who met Isel knew she was a heart-transplant patient. She wore that label proudly, even posting it on her Facebook page,' said the family’s lawyer, Michael Fruhling.

'That Dr. Davie failed to mention this is beyond comprehension.'

Revealing: Pineda's boyfriend found copies of her paperwork in her purse

Pineda paid $3,200 for the procedure, described in online ads as being to 'lose the wobble'. She went into cardiac arrest before leaving Davie's office. 

Paramedics tried to revive her but she was declared dead at Coney Island Hospital.

The Health Department had banned Davie from a series of procedures due to a history of misconduct.

Davies has been cited in seven malpractice suits for negligence in which he was fined $100,000 and put on probation for three years. Other patients have complained of burns and disfigurement.
