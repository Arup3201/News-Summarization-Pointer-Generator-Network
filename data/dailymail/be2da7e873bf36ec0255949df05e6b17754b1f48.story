Her conduct in the months since her rescue from the family friend who kidnapped her and allegedly murdered her mother and brother has been the subject of intense scrutiny.

Now, MailOnline can reveal, members of Hannah Anderson’s own family are confused by the 16-year-old’s behaviour in the aftermath of the brutal double murder and her kidnap, with one branding it, ‘downright disturbing.’

Jennifer Willis, Hannah’s great-aunt, has broken her silence in a soon to be published book, ‘The River of No Return: On the Trail of Hannah Anderson and Jim DiMaggio.’

Face of grief? The very day she appeared on the Today show Hannah posted these pictures of herself and friend Alan McNabb joking around in her New York hotel room

The teenager has regularly posted to her public Instagram account in the wake of her mother and brother's tragic deaths. She added this picture on her way to do a Today Show interview

Speaking to author and criminal profiler, Chelsea Hoffman, Mrs Willis admitted: ‘We haven’t seen her grieve at all.

‘It’s not the Hannah we know. It’s downright disturbing.’

Mrs
Willis was so close to her niece Christina that the women were, she 
said, ‘more like sisters.’  Revealing her own profound pain in the 
aftermath of Christina and Ethan’s killings she said: ‘I can hardly 
breathe most of the time.’

A victim in every sense of the word: Hannah and her father, Brett, as she is interviewed by the Today Show's Savannah Guthrie. Investigators are adamant that Hannah is a victim in every way

She and several other relatives admitted to being deeply troubled by Hannah’s apparent lack of grief and string of outlandish, often sexually precocious, postings on social media, according to Hoffman.

On the day of her mother and brother’s funeral she tweeted pictures of herself and a friend, fingers posed like guns, with the hastag ‘true-thugs’.

Sexually precocious: Hannah posted this picture of her shirtless boyfriend making her breakfast after boasting that her grandmother, with whom she lives, allows him to sleepover with her

And the very day that the teenager spoke fully for the first time, reliving the ordeal of being forced to play Russian Roulette while hearing her brother crying from another room - on the Today show, she posted images of herself with a male friend, pouting, giggling and ‘twerking’ her New York hotel room.

While Hannah was there, she excitedly posted pictures on her Instagram account, including several close-ups of Miley Cyrus' live performance.

Two days ago she boasted online that her grandmother, with whom Hannah now lives, allowed her boyfriend to sleep over and pictured him shirtless and making her scrambled eggs for breakfast.

A family at odds with itself: Her father has asked for privacy to allow Hannah to process the trauma of her ordeal but just last week his daughter was tweeting about family difficulties.

Speaking to MailOnline Miss Hoffman, 29, said: ‘It is very clear from the family members I’ve spoken with that this is not a family united in their shared grief at all. It’s sad but it’s a family very much at odds with itself.’

Only last week Hannah tweeted: ‘My family still can’t get along. Wtf?!’

According to Mrs Willis there were often tensions between Christina’s side of the family and that of Hannah’s father, Brett.

But in a poignant admission she revealed that Christina, who was estranged from her husband, at the time of her death, had harbored hopes of a reconciliation and of ‘having her family back together again.’

Instead all hopes ended in a scene of utter devastation.

In the weeks before her brutal murder Christina Anderson, pictured here with son Ethan, Hannah and estranged husband, Brett, had harbored hopes of reconciling and of having her family back together

In her book Miss Hoffman examines Hannah’s own account of the events that lead up to that day and its aftermath and the book points to what Miss Hoffman considers to be a myriad of inconsistencies and unanswered questions by which some of Hannah’s own relatives admit to being troubled.

The burned bodies of Christina Anderson, 44, Ethan, 8, and the family dog were found by fire-fighters in the charred remains of family friend Jim DiMaggio’s burned out home in Boulevard, California on 4 August.

In the weeks before her murder Christina habored hopes of 'having her family back together again.'

Christina’s mouth and neck was wrapped tightly with duct tape and her ankles bound with plastic cable. She had been viciously bludgeoned to death.

Investigators were not able to determine Ethan’s cause of death as his body was almost completely consumed by fire. But what little remained suggested extreme suffering and violence.

The grim discoveries marked the beginning of a massive FBI manhunt as it quickly transpired that DiMaggio, believed to have time devices to ignite at his home, had abducted Hannah. 

Seven days later DiMaggio and Hannah were traced to a riverside in a stretch of Idaho wilderness called No Return when four horseback riders who had encountered them on the trail returned and raised the alarm.

The world in her hands: Jim DiMaggio took this picture of Hannah on one of their trips.

#hardnight#misshim: Hannah posted this image of herself with her little brother expressing her grief and simply stating 'It's not the same and it never will be.'

DiMaggio was gunned down by six snipers in the rescue that followed. 

By then a disturbing portrait had emerged of the family friend, as a 40-year-old man with inappropriate sexual feelings for the teenage Hannah. DiMaggio was Hannah’s father, Brett’s, best friend and had known the teen all her life. According to Hannah in the weeks before her abduction, DiMaggio had admitted to having a ‘crush’ on her.

Hitting back: Many of Hannah's online posts have appeared to speak directly to her many critics and those who have questioned her

The public instinct was to embrace Hannah as a teenager who had survived an unimaginable trauma only to be told that the mother and brother she thought were waiting for her, were dead.

But as investigators worked to establish the nature of Hannah’s relationship with her abductor troubling details began to emerge which sparked a change in public opinion. 

Authorities have been adamant in their assertion that Hannah is ‘a victim in every sense of the word.'

But many have struggled to square the teenager’s online persona and postings with this tag.

Hannah and DiMaggio exchanged 13 phonecalls on the day of the killings before both phones were switched off simultaneously.

In addition to this officers executing a search warrant at DiMaggio’s home found letters written from the teenager to DiMaggio in which she shared grievances about her mother with whom she was not getting along.

The moving leg-brace: Hannah initially tried to claim that these pictures were taken on different days before ultimately explaining the switching brace by saying the left leg was injured in Idaho, the right one was the result of an old sports injury

True thugs: Many were surprised by Hannah's decision to post this image of her posing with a friend on the day of her brother and mother's funerals

It was revealed that the pair took 
trips together. One eye-brow raising tweet posted just weeks before the 
abduction, showed Hannah on one such trip. The picture, taken from 
behind, shows Hannah in cut-off denim shorts.

It
was taken by DiMaggio and was tagged by Hannah ‘when you got the world 
in your hands nobody can stop you …#bye #Hollywood #bye #Malibu #hello 
#river’

The hardest day of her life: Hannah posted this image on 11 October, the day her little brother Ethan would have turned 9

A public expression of private grief: Hannah regularly posts pictures of Christina and Ethan saying how much she misses them

Baby cakes: Investigators were unable to determine the cause of Ethan's death as his body was all but destroyed in the blaze that tore through DiMaggio's house in California

In relating how it was that DiMaggio 
overpowered her Hannah has said that he gave her a pill she now believes
to be Ambien.  She has said she was unconscious from that moment until 
waking in Idaho and has no recollection of even being put in his car.

Criminal profiler Chelsea Hoffman's book exploring the Hannah Anderson case is published on 2 November

But video released from security 
checkpoints on the route shows Hannah, apparently wide awake and seated 
in the passenger seat next to DiMaggio, according to Hoffman.

The author also focusses on how Hannah has claimed that she 
hurt her left knee during days of gruelling hiking through inhospitable 
terrain, during which she carried two 50lbs backpacks for DiMaggio and 
tweeted pictures showing her heavily strapped leg.

Pictures taken later the same day show the leg brace on her right leg. When online commentators picked up on the strange switch Hannah initially claimed the pictures were taken on different days.

When it emerged that they were taken on the same day she retorted that one knee had been injured in Idaho and the other had arthritis due to an old sporting injury.

Miss Hoffman said: ‘There are so many unanswered questions in this case that it’s my sincere hope it is reopened. What happened was so shocking and what’s come after it is just very sad.

‘Hannah is letting off steam through social media and has cut herself off from some of the people who care for her and who are going through their own profound grief.

‘Jennifer is one of them. She sees the way Hannah is behaving and she just doesn’t understand what’s going on – this Hannah is not the little girl she helped raise.' 

A spokesman for Hannah and her father, Brett, declined to comment.
