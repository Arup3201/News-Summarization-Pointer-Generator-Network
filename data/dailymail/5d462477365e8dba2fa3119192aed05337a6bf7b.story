Police have launched a criminal negligence investigation into whether a British socialite who jumped to her death from the roof Beverly Hills plastic surgery was suffering from a reaction to anaesthetic.

Sandra D’Auriol, 53, a jeweller who had worked for the Royal Family’s supplier Asprey, was apparently recovering from a facelift when she threw off her clothing, ran to the building's 15th storey roof and jumped to her death.

Now investigators are reportedly trying to establish whether the Beverly Hill clinic owned by 'surgeon to the stars' Dr Brian Novack was in any way negligent in its care of the mother-of-two.

Police spent three hours trying to talk the mother-of-two down as she sat naked with her legs dangling over a ledge.

Mrs
 D’Auriol, who lived in Hong Kong, was known for making one-of-a-kind 
jewellery and often donated profits from her business to charity.

There are a number of rare but serious physical complications resulting from general and local anesthetics, including increased risk of respiratory depression and heart attacks.

But the true effect of anesthesia on the human mind remains somewhat unclear.

One worrying symptom is emergence delirium - a temporary mental condition affecting around 5 per cent of patients that can result in a state of heightened emotion or excitement in the hours or days after anesthesia.

Patients suffering emergence delirium may also experience temporary psychomotor agitation, the symptoms of which include seemingly odd behaviour such as pacing around a room, removing clothing and in more extreme cases self-harming.

Other patients reports extreme long and short-term changes in personality following anesthesia, including developing bouts of depression and anxiety.

In 2006, talented 21-year-old student James Wentworth-Stanley committed suicide just 10 days after a minor operation.

He had told his mother he 'didn't feel right' after the surgery, and sunk into a deep depression that saw him desperately contacting doctors for help before eventually committing suicide.

It has since emerged that the anesthetics James was administered have all been linked to depression, anxiety or suicidal thoughts.

Since his death, James' mother Clare Milford Haven claims to have compiled a large amount of evidence that suggests many clinicians and pharmacologists believe there is a small but definite link between the drugs used in anaesthetics and suicidal behaviour.

She
 is said to have undergone a facelift at the Camden Medical Arts 
Building office of Dr Novack in Beverly Hills last Tuesday and was kept 
there overnight  for observation.

According to the New York Daily News, the clinic is now at the centre of a police criminal negligence investigation.

The
 patient woke the following morning ‘agitated and aggressive’ and, 
according to an office worker, was pulling at her hair before dashing up
 to the roof at 7am.

‘She 
sat on the ledge naked, then got up and walked around the edge of the 
building as if on a tightrope. She sat back down again before getting up
 and jumping off,’ said a witness.

Beverly Hills police confirmed they are investigating the death, but refused to comment further.

A
 rare post-operation complication known as ‘emergence delirium’ can 
result in a state of heightened emotion or excitement in the hours or 
days after anaesthesia and affects around 5 per  cent of patients.

Sufferers may also experience temporary ‘psychomotor agitation’ – 
restless movements that stem from mental tension – including pacing 
around a room, removing clothing and, in some extreme cases, 
self-harming.

Dr Novack has not yet commented. He has been credited with performing 
facelifts and other cosmetic operations on some of the biggest stars in 
the entertainment business.

He
 was once described as the ‘best plastic surgeon no one will recommend’ 
because his famous patients pay high prices to look as if they have not 
had any work done at all.

Avi
 Rai, a former colleague of Mrs D’Auriol at the Child Welfare Scheme in 
Hong Kong, where she was a director, said: ‘It was a tragic incident. It
 has been a very difficult time for her family.

‘She
 was British and married with two children. It would not be appropriate 
for me to say anything more as the death is still under investigation.’

The
 jeweller was born in India to British parents and grew up in Singapore 
and Ibiza. Her French husband Yan D’Auriol, a former L’Oreal executive, 
runs a cosmetics business from Hong Kong.

Mr
 D’Auriol’s 12-year-old son, Teo, drowned in a swimming pool in Bali in 
2004, according to a 2008 article in the South China Morning Post.

Mrs
 D’Auriol’s biography on the Child Welfare Scheme website states she had
 been involved with CWS since 1999 and ‘despite being a wonderful and 
busy mother, wife and friend, she always has plenty of time to help 
anyone in need’.

In 2006, 
21-year-old James Wentworth-Stanley, son of the Marchioness of Milford 
Haven, committed suicide ten days after a minor operation.

The student 
told his mother he ‘didn’t feel right’ after the surgery and became 
severely depressed before killing himself.
