Those who fear 3D-printed plastic guns take note: a Tennessee man has demonstrated that a deadly firearm can also be made completely out of items available from airport retail stores.

Web developer Evan Booth of Greensboro, North Carolina moonlights as a 'security expert' and can make projectile weapons with things like hairdryers and Axe body spray--all of which you can get after you make it through security.

While he has an airport crossbow, blowgun, and spiked club, it's Booth's hand-built gun--which he calls his BLUNDERBUSiness Class--that seems most worrisome.

Scary: Evan Booth of Greensboro hosts a website where he demonstrates how to make, among other things, a gun (pictured) out of items available for purchase in airport terminals past the security checkpoint

‘I think people have kind of been suspecting that the type of things I’ve built are possible,’ Booth tells Fast Company. ‘I just don’t think anyone’s ever taken the time to do it.’

Booth, who attended East Tennessee State University and earned a degree in digital media, says he embarked on the startling project after airports began to introduce body scanners.

‘It just seemed so invasive, really expensive,’ he said. ‘And if you’re going to go through all that trouble getting into the terminal, why is all this stuff available in the terminal?’

To Booth, whose speaking engagements include hacker conferences across America and abroad, that stuff equaled a disturbing possibility. 

Ingenious: Booth says he got the idea to when he realized he could buy lithium batteries, which cause a hot chemical reaction when combined with water. 'If I wanted to build something very potent, I would probably go toward lithium,' he says

Aromatic: The lithium and water create enough heat to blow up a 1oz can of Axe body spray 

So he began tinkering with the range of seemingly innocuous items available in airport shops that line the terminals on the wrong side of security.

And he found that not only was he able to create a gun, but he could also make a range of potentially deadly weapons, all of which he demonstrates on his website Terminal Cornucopia.

‘If we're trying stop a terrorist threat at the airport,’ says Booth. ‘It's already too late.’

KERPOW! The can of Axe body spray explodes in a cloud of fire

Serious business: Using a handful of change as the projectile, the gun Booth dubs a BLUNDERBUSiness Class blows a hole larger than a quarter in a drywall target

Moonlighting: Evan Booth works with computers by day but calls himself a 'security researcher' by night, which is when he tinkers with his airport weapons at his home in North Carolina

The idea for his BLUNDERBUSiness gun came
 to him after he realized airports sell lithium batteries. When mixed 
with water, that lithium can create enough heat to turn a can of Axe 
body spray into aromatic ammunition.

Combine it with a hollowed out hair dryer, some gossip magazines and other sundries and you’ve got yourself a gun.

‘Right now if I wanted to build something very potent, I would probably go toward lithium,’ says Booth.

His YouTube demonstrations show his DIY gun propelling a handful of pocket change powerfully enough to blow a quart-sized hole though Sheetrock.

In an effort to win some research 
funds—and shield himself from unfriendly investigators—Booth notified 
the FBI, CIA, and other agencies of his activities prior to posting them
 on the internet.

‘It would have been awesome if I’d had access to, like, a cockpit door,’ he says.

Booth
 continues to tinker away at his airport terminal weapons and tells Fast
 Company he has a stun gun and others in mind already.

Getting medieval: Booth also found a way to make a crossbow out of airport items. A Galaxy Grabber is hand-operated robotic toy claw
