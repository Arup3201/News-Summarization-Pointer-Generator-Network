As thousands of people start to flee their homes to escape the destructive path of Irene, thrillseeking hurricane surfers have been flocking to beaches to take advantage of the supersized waves.

Hurricane swells - the waves created outside the direct area of the hurricane - are reaching up to 30 feet along the East Coast.

But as beachgoers started to enjoy the surf, New Jersey governor Chris Christie warned: 'Get the hell off the beach.'

One of the biggest surfing 
competitions in the world, the 49th annual East Coast Surfing 
Championships, is underway on Virginia Beach, Virginia.

'The risk, the excitement factorâ€¦ getting really good waves is addicting,' said hurricane surfer Shea Lopez who is competing.

'It's something that's uncommon. I couldn't be any more excited for any day of the year.'

Mr Lopez, 37, said he is monitoring the East Coast to see where to go next.

'It's our only chance as East Coast surfers to get large, powerful waves like in other places in the world,' he told ABC News.

'It's exciting being around the hurricane. You can't help but get caught up in the drama.'

The competition's rounds are being rushed through so the contest is over before conditions become too dangerous.

'The primary concern is for the safety of the competitors and spectators,' Kevin Gaydosh, spokesman for the competition , told ABC News.

'There's nobody that has a healthier respect for the water than surfers.'
