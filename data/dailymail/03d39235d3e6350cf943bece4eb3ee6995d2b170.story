The body of an elderly woman was discovered in a freezer by police after a suspected mercy killing, it has been reported.

The 90-year-old, named locally as Louise Brough, was discovered on Friday by officers in her tower block council flat in Portsmouth, Hampshire, after officers received a 999 call from council workers concerned for her welfare.

A 53-year-old man was arrested by police on suspicion of murder and was later released on bail.

Neighbours said the woman and her son had lived in the same flat in the block, and that the woman had been suffering from ill-health.

Police questioned neighbours whether they had seen a freezer being delivered to the dead woman's property.

Neighbour
Kelly Griffin, 34, said: ‘I couldn’t believe it. I got a knock on the 
door from the police who said they were investigating something.

‘I used to send over a Christmas card for her. I sold her my car years ago.

‘I’ve got kids so it makes you worry and sends a shiver down your spine.'

Sid Simpson, 68, said granddaughter Denise, 21, watched from the top window as her body was brought out.

He said: 'There were coppers everywhere and they had dogs with them. She was a nice woman.

'It must have been years since I last spoke to her. I first met her when I moved in 20 years ago.'

Door-to-door enquiries have been carried out and the ground floor property has been sealed up by police.

An officer was standing guard at the entrance to the large concrete tower block, which is also home to some of the council's civic and housing offices.
