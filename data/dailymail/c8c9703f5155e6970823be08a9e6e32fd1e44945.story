Coronation Street star Bill Roache has returned to a new-age healing group to seek support as he fights to clear his name of child sex charges.

Appearing calm and relaxed, the 81-year-old actor was seen hugging two women outside the Circle of Love meeting in Manchester last week.

Just days earlier, Roache, now on bail, had been charged with historic sexual offences against five girls.

After not being at the regular meetings for several months following his arrest on child abuse charges, the Coronation Street star embraced a friend

The three-and-a-half hour Circle of Love gathering was held at a community centre south of Manchester city centre, the Sunday Mirror reported.

Roache, a devotee of the Pure Love Movement for several years, is not believed to have attended since his arrest two months ago.

Circle of Love ­founder Ann Rogers, 
71, a retired nurse, told the Sunday Mirror: ‘He was just Bill. He is 
part of the group, part of our group.'

She said he sought support and the group would help him fight the charges.

Members gather in a ‘circle of love’, 
meditating, taking part in alternative reiki healing sessions and 
discussing the mysteries of the spiritual world.

In February, Roache's girlfriend of three years, 
44-year-old weathergirl Emma Jesson, revealed that they had gone their 
separate ways so he could be free to 'explore a mystic message of love'.

Speaking of the break-up, she said: 'Bill's spiritual beliefs became more of
a priority last year. He wants that to be his path now and
I accept that, as he needs to be at peace with himself.'

Roache was 
charged in May with two counts of raping a teenage girl in 1967 and
appeared at Preston Crown Court last week so a trial date could be set.

The
actor, who has played Ken Barlow in the ITV1 soap since its launch, 
also faced fresh charges of five indecent assaults involving four 
girls aged between 11 or 12 and 16.

He denies all the charges.

Roache
appeared last week for a five-minute preliminary hearing and was bailed 
until his next court appearance on September 2 when he will enter formal
pleas.

His trial date was fixed for January 13.

Roache is one of the best-known stars to be held over child sex allegations in the aftermath of the Jimmy Savile scandal.

His
friend Stuart Hall, the disgraced BBC TV presenter, is due to be 
sentenced later this month after he admitted indecently assaulting 13 
girls during the 1960s, 70s and 80s.

One was aged just nine when she was molested by the It’s a Knockout host.

Fellow Coronation Street star Michael
Le Vell, who plays mechanic Kevin Webster, is also currently off air 
after being charged with 19 sexual offences against a child, including 
rape, indecent assault and sexual activity.

He denies the charges, which
are not linked to Roache.

The
Crown Prosecution Service has said three of the new offences 
allegedly committed by Roache took place in 1965 and two in 1968.

Roache – the world’s
longest-serving soap actor – has played Ken Barlow in the ITV1 soap 
since its launch, but will not be appearing in the programme until legal
proceedings are concluded.

Fans of the soap were stunned when 
the twice-married star was taken into custody following a raid at his 
home in Wilmslow, Cheshire, last month and charged with twice raping a 
15-year-old girl in 1967 when he was 35 and married to his first wife.

In a statement issued by his lawyers 
after he was charged with those offences, he said he 'strenuously' denies the allegations and vowed to fight 'to preserve my 
innocence in the challenging times ahead'.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
