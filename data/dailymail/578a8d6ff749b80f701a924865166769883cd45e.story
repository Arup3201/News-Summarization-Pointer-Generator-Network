Prince William, ever a fan of rugby union, took time out of his busy schedule to watch Wales play Australia at the Millenium Stadium on Saturday.

And afterwards, he was presented with a charity calender featuring women players in a variety of nude poses.

William, upon looking at the photographs, was said to have declared enthusiastically: 'Very good shots... I can recommend this!'

In the match itself, Australia came from behind to beat Wales 33-28 in a thrilling match in Cardiff. Bernard Foley kicked 18 points, the most important of which coming in the final minutes of the game, when he converted a drop goal and then a penalty in quick succession.

Wales had gone in to the second-half level at 21-21, but Warren Gatland's side were unable to hold on. 

After the match, William attended a tea with former players, organised by the Welsh Rugby Charitable Trust, of which he is Patron.

In August, the girls have a kit check. When William delved inside the front cover he roared with laughter – and held up one image to show another guest at his table

William and Kate – who visited Wales yesterday – will embark on a three-day trip to New York next month to unveil their new charity, United For Wildlife

Former ladies player Fran Bateman presented him with the calendar during the event, the pages including various nude shots of the ladies of Gwernyfed RFC.

Later, Bateman said: 'He thought it was outrageously funny. He was having a really good laugh.'

William and Kate had earlier visited the Valero Pembroke Refinery on the Pembrokeshire coast, before travelling to the Welsh capital for the match.
