Swampy now: Going by his real name these days, Daniel Hooper lives in a yurt with his four children in a remote hippy commune in the Welsh valleys

He was once at the forefront of every major environmental protest in Britain.

Known as Swampy, he gained notoriety by tunnelling under a bypass to try to stop construction of a road.

But the once dreadlocked eco-warrior has turned his back on protesting and is living in a remote hippy commune in Wales.

He no longer wants to be called Swampy and instead goes by his real name, Daniel Hooper.

The 40-year-old lives with his four children in a yurt alongside 100 hippies, New Age travellers and nudists in a 200-acre stretch of farmland in the Welsh valleys.

The assortment of characters in the camp live in tepees, caravans, yurts and mud houses.

There is a communal tent, Big Lodge, where they gather for yoga sessions and meditation.

The group, who appear almost entirely self-sufficient, even hold raves and full moon parties in the valley.

They are more than ten miles from the nearest town, Llandeilo in Carmarthenshire.

Swampy and his children sleep rough on sheepskins in his yurt.

Solar panels provide power for a small radio and a mobile phone.

However, the children do attend the local school each day, dressed in traditional uniform.

The council even sends a school bus up the dirt track to the commune to pick them up.

The former eco-warrior spends his days as a tree surgeon for the Forestry Commission and tries to make time to tend to his vegetable patch.

And in the evenings he takes his children walking or climbing.

He said: ‘I’ve got a family now and a home. I can’t run off for weeks at a time. But my views on the environment are just the same.

'There is part of me that misses that life. Spending a week up a crane in protest to the construction of Terminal 5 at Heathrow was something special, but I leave it to others at the moment.’

Hippy home: The family live in this virtually self-contained hippy community near Talley, west Wales, with the former eco-warrior spending his days working as a tree surgeon for the Forestry Commission

The single father says he has no plans to join the anti-fracking protesters in Balcombe, West Sussex.

But he admits he could resurface as an eco-warrior if fracking companies started drilling in Wales.

‘I have a strong opinion on fracking,’ he said.

‘I hope the protesters succeed in what they are doing and change the Tory policy on fracking, like our protests changed Labour’s policy on road building in the 1990s.’

On a protest in 1997: Swampy and other protesters dug tunnels beneath the planned A30 bypass in Devon, then he helped to build a network of tunnels to try to stop the expansion of Manchester airport

Born to middle-class parents Peter and Jill, both now 70, in Berkshire, Swampy made his name in 1996 when he led hundreds of protesters who chained themselves to trees in protest at the construction of a bypass in Newbury.

A year later he and other protesters dug tunnels beneath the planned A30 bypass in Devon, then he helped to build a network of tunnels to try to stop the expansion of Manchester airport.

Despite the actions of Swampy and his fellows, all the projects went ahead.
