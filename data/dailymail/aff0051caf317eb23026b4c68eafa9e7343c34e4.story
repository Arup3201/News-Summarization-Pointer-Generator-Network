The mother and caregiver of an autistic man, who also has cerebral palsy, have been charged after he was hospitalized and suffered from severe burns to his hand.

Dyrue McGee, 24, from Pittsburgh was taken to the hospital last October after he was scalded on his right hand, which left severe injuries causing him to stay in treatment for 58 days.

His mother, Vonda Brown, 44, allegedly submerged her adult son's hand into hot liquid while at their family home last year, and has been charged with aggravated assault.

When McGee was taken to Ohio Valley Hospital in McKees Rocks on October 13 for treatment, he was screaming to be fed, as staff found him to be malnourished and only weighing 58-lbs, according to the Pittsburgh-Post Gazette.

McGee has been taken into protective custody following the incident.

A hospital spokesperson said when McGee arrived, the staff had concerns about his care and contacted authorities, according to CBS Pittsburgh.

McGee's full-time carer, Armando Navarro, 45, who is reportedly in a relationship with Brown, has also been charged in the case.

He is accused of submitting false time sheets so that he could get paid for work that he did not do while McGee was in hospital.

Both Brown and Navarro have claimed McGee was 'constantly eating', however his malnutrition was evident of a 'chronic constant abuse situation', according to the criminal complaint.

Brown also denied the accusations that she caused abuse to her son's hand, saying that she had discovered it after she removed the sock that she had previously placed on it.

She said she had placed the sock on his hand to protect it when he becomes agitated and 'hits himself in the face'.

However, doctors told officials her story was inconsistent with his wounds.

Brown's son was able to receive a caregiver, who was Navarro, through the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services, which she helped coordinate and also reviews his time sheets.

While McGee was in hospital, Navarro submitted false time sheets for 18 days, which he received $2,000 for those hours even though he did not work. 

However, he claims he still 'did work around the house', according to an affidavit.

Navarro and Brown have both been charged with Medicaid fraud. 

A neighbor, who did not see Brown and McGee often, said he is shocked to learn of the allegations.

Bob White said: 'We always thought it was a kid. We're devastated around here. We never knew anything like that could happen.'

McGee has reportedly gained weight since being in protective custody, according to WTAE. 

Following their arrest on Wednesday, Navarro has been released while Brown remains in jail unable to post her $5,000 bond.

A preliminary hearing is set to take place in two weeks.
