A man has been sentenced to life in prison for beating his girlfriend's two-year-old son to death.

Ronald Dimambro Jr., from Washington Township, Michigan, was convicted in June of first-degree murder and first-degree child abuse for breaking Damian Sutton's skull in August last year.

Before the sentencing on Thursday, Damian's distraught mother, Nicole, called her ex-boyfriend a 'demon' and an 'evil monster' for how he had treated her son, who died six days after he was beaten.

'Damian is getting his justice today,' she said as she held on to her son's blue blanket, the Detroit Free-Press reported.

But 27-year-old Dimambro, who admitted in police interviews to shaking the child, insisted that he had never intended to kill the little boy, saying it was 'simply an accident'.

'This was not intentional,' he said before the sentencing. 'I wish he could come back.'

Damian was being looked after by Dimambro when he was attacked on August 21. The boy suffered a blunt force trauma to his head and experts said the injuries were not accidental.

He underwent brain surgery as doctors tried to reduce the swelling by removing part of his skull.

But his parents eventually decided to switch off his life support after six days. He died on August 27.

When Dimambro had called 911, he initially told dispatchers that the two-year-old was suffering an asthma attack, then later said he fell out of his crib. He eventually admitted shaking the child.

Judge Jennifer Faunce told Dimambro that the boy had 'died violently at your hands' and that a life sentence did not seem like enough of a punishment.

'Youâ€™ve created a pain that will never go away,' she said.

Damian's father also told the court how the youngster, who was born when he was just 22, had turned his life around. The responsibility forced him to pull himself together and get a job, he said.

He said he was getting his life back on track just as he received the devastating call that his son was in the hospital.

'I like to believe Damian saved my life,' Tim Sutton told the court. 'I will never be able to thank him.'

Defense attorney Randy Rodnick said Dimambro will appeal.
