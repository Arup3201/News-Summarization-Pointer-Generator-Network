A former U.S. Army sergeant accused of murdering two unarmed teenage boys while they herded cattle in Iraq is due to appear in a military court.

Former Staff Sergeant Michael Barbera is charged with killing Ahmad Khalid al-Timmimi, 15, and his brother Abbas, 14 - both of whom were deaf - as they tended to cattle in a palm grove just outside As Sadah, about 50 miles northeast of Baghdad.

Barbera, 31, who faces a mandatory life sentence if convicted, is set for a preliminary hearing at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state later this afternoon.

Accused: Authorities say Sergeant Michael Barbera fatally shot two unarmed, deaf Iraqi boys in 2007

The U.S. army has released few details of the March 2007 killing, but Pittsburgh newspaper The Tribune-Review last year claimed soldiers serving alongside Barbera had reported the deaths.

The newspaper said the soldiers remain troubled that he hadn't been prosecuted.

Barbera also reportedly faces additional charges of lying to his commanders, directing fellow soldiers to lie to military investigators, and making a threatening call to a civilian.

He had previously led Charlie Troop, 5th 
Squadron of the 73rd Airborne Reconnaissance Regiment out of Fort Bragg,
 North Carolina.

'Leader': Barbera led a small-kill team in the Army's 73rd Airborne Reconnaissance Regiment when the alleged murders took place

At the time of the alleged murders, the squadron was 
involved in counterinsurgency operations in the Diyala province of Iraq.

That's when military officials say Barbera fatally shot the two boys before lying to his superiors about how they died.

'None of us feel good about this. But I'm glad that the army is 
doing the right thing,' Ken Katter - a 46-year-old sniper assigned to Barbera's team - said at the time.

It isn't clear if Barbera has a civilian lawyer in addition to military defense attorneys.

Barbera was most recently stationed at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska.
