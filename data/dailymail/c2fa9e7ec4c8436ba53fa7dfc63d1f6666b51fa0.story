Graphic photographs of the Iraqis that British soldiers are said to have ‘tortured and murdered’ in cold blood were shown to an inquiry into alleged war crimes yesterday.

On the opening day of the long-awaited Al-Sweady Inquiry, film footage of ambulances taking the bodies of the dead from a British base to a nearby hospital and mortuary – and of distraught relatives identifying their loved ones – was also played.

Retired High Court judge Sir Thayne Forbes is examining claims that UK troops executed up to 20 prisoners, including a 14-year-old boy, and abused nine others after a  battle at an Army checkpoint in May 2004.

Iraqi death certificates for some of the victims documented signs of torture, including mutilation with several having missing eyes, broken bones and one man’s penis had been removed.

The inquiry was told that one Iraqi witness said he saw one of the dead men have his eyes gouged out by a soldier with a bayonet.

The allegations have been vehemently denied by the Ministry of Defence, which says the victims were insurgents killed in battle.

The inquiry is named after 19-year-old Hameed Al-Sweady, one of those who died after a firefight between UK soldiers and  insurgents at a checkpoint three miles north of the town of Majar  Al Kabir.

According to Army accounts, the soldiers from the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders were heavily outnumbered in the ambush but fought back heroically, mounting a bayonet charge at one point until the attackers were defeated.

The inquiry is looking at claims that Iraqis were unlawfully killed at Camp Abu Naji and that five Iraqi detainees were tortured and ill-treated there, and at a detention facility at Shaibah Logistics Base.

Jonathan Acton Davis, lead counsel for the inquiry, said in his opening statement that enemy dead would normally have been left on the battlefield.

But soldiers were apparently given an order to identify the dead to try to find a man thought to be involved in the murder of six British military policemen in 2003.

The Iraqis claim the British troops took bloody revenge for the Red Caps massacre a year earlier.

Mr Acton Davis said: ‘It is the claimants’ case that not all of the 20 died on the battlefield, but that at least one of them was murdered by a British soldier after he had been returned alive to Camp Abu Naji, while other Iraqis were tortured and ill-treated.’

The inquiry began after a team, including 12 former Metropolitan Police detectives, spent more than three years compiling evidence.

The hearing, in central London, was shown the photos of 20 blood-stained corpses taken by a British army captain for identification.

Several were wearing insurgent uniforms and one was identified with the help of a card in the name of the Movement of the Mujahideen of the Islamic Republic of Iraq. The inquiry, ordered in 2009,  follows a legal battle by Mr Al-Sweady’s uncle and five Iraqis who claim they were abused by British troops after the firefight.

Some 15 Iraqis will travel to the UK to give evidence to the inquiry later this month. A further 45 Iraqis, including relatives and medical staff, will give evidence via video-link from the British Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon.

Evidence from military witnesses is due to start around September, continuing until February next year. It is hoped the inquiry report will be finished by the end of 2014.
