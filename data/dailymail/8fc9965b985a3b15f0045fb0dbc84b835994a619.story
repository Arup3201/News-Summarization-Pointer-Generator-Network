Rat Pack crooner Sammy Davis Jr's little black book featuring Hollywood stars like Barbra Streisand and Clint Eastwood offers a rare glimpse into the singer's showbiz life.

The late megastar's personal address book dates from the 1980s when his long career was a few decades away from his heyday in the 1950s and 1960s.

It reads like a who's who of super-stardom and includes names and addresses of the likes of Oscar-winner Sidney Poitier, Michael Jackson and even tennis star Bjorn Borg.

Perhaps one of the most unusual names listed in the book is that of former US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who allegedly had a relationship with Davis Jr's wife Altovise.

Los Angeles-based auction house Nate D Sanders is selling off the spiral-bound book filled out by the singer later today and the minimum bid is $4,000.

Davis Jr. was an American entertainer famed for his association with singers Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Peter Lawford and Joey Bishop.

The collective was called The Rat Pack and in the height of their fame in the 1960s starred in several films including the original Ocean's 11.

Davis, who was one of the first African-American stars, shot to fame in 1951 after a performance that rocked Hollywood nightclub Ciro's after that year's Academy Awards.

He starred in his own TV show and became a hot favourite on the Las Vegas circuit, earning the nickname 'Mr Showbusiness'.

He died from complications after surgery for lung cancer on May 16, 1990 in Beverley Hills, California.
