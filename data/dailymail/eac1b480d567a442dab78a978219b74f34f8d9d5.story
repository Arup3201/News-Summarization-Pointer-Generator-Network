Ordeal: Kayley Howson, 18, endured a three year legal ordeal culminating in her testifying against her alleged assailant in court only to see him cleared by a jury

A teenager hanged herself while suffering from severe depression after a man she accused of rape was acquitted, an inquest heard.

Kayley Howson, 18, endured a three-year ordeal to bring the alleged assailant to court but he was cleared by a jury.

The college student and budding poet was said to have taken the verdict ‘very, very hard’.

Two years later her mother found her hanged at her home.

Yesterday, more than four years after the tragedy, a coroner described the rape investigation as a ‘catastrophic episode’ in her life.

East Lancashire coroner Richard Taylor added: ‘She was a normal, slightly shy 14-year-old who was subjected to what the  psychiatrist described as a catastrophic episode when she said she was sexually assaulted. The effects were traumatic.

‘We must never ever forget that this was a young girl, just trying to be normal, trying to grow up.’

When Miss Howson was 14 she told a teacher she had been raped, the inquest heard. The case went to court in 2006 and Miss Howson gave evidence via video link.

Her mother Janet Mitchell, 52, told the inquest: ‘Giving evidence was hard for her. Kayley started self-harming after revealing what had allegedly happened. She was a completely different person from before, overcome with waves of depression.

‘She’d go to her bedroom and write. Deep poetry was her way of expressing herself.’

Following the acquittal Miss Howson went on a downward spiral and took 12 overdoses of painkillers.

‘Kayley was totally traumatised,’ her 
mother said in an interview. ‘The police officers felt terrible, too. 
They said they felt they’d let her down.

‘Kayley blamed herself. She believed everyone would think she was a liar.

‘It was heartbreaking watching my little girl crumble.’

The inquest was told Miss Howson, who 
had hopes of becoming a psychiatric nurse, was also prescribed the 
controversial drug Depakote.

Its makers have faced lawsuits in America over claims it was used improperly for schizophrenia and autism.

The inquest heard Miss Howson’s dosage
of Depakote had to be lowered after she started suffering side effects 
including stomach cramps and backache.

Nine days before her death she  abruptly stopped taking the drug after seeing her doctor.

Mrs Mitchell told the inquest, which 
was delayed due to difficulties assembling witnesses: ‘It was 
immediately noticeable there was a change in her. Her mood swings became
worse.’

Questions: Around
two weeks before her death Kayley had stopped taking the drug Depakote,
more commonly used for treatment for epileptics, after a consultation 
with her doctor

In March 2008 Miss Howson  was found hanged at home  in Burnley.

A note was found and her diary showed she had been experiencing suicidal thoughts. The coroner recorded a narrative verdict.

He added: ‘Her diary is private and 
not for public consumption but I have seen it and it describes an 
intelligent person with rational thoughts trying to work out what was 
happening to her.’

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
