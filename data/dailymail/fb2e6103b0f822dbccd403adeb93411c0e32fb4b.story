Daley Blind will not be joining Manchester United on the cheap this summer, according to the Ajax director of football Marc Overmars.

The Dutchman player has been linked with a switch to join former national team coach Van Gaal at Old Trafford, praised for being able to play in a number of positions.

But Overmars insists he will only be able to leave, this summer at least, for his 'absolute top price'.

Tough tackling: The Dutch international has been linked with a switch to Manchester United

 'We believe that we currently have a strong team and want Daley to stay for another year,' he told De Telegraaf.

'Only if the absolute top price is paid is a transfer negotiable.

'Daley's management know how we feel at the moment. Next year we will have a much more lenient policy, we are willing to talk with Daley and we will settle for a reasonable price.'

Van Gaal has recently brought in Marcos Rojo and Angel di Maria to the club, while Sportsmail understands negotiations are continuing with Arturo Vidal and Blind.

But Overmars says the Eredivise side have not been contacted by United.

'There's some rumblings around Daley, some clubs enquired, but there is no concrete offer. And with Manchester United, there is no contact at all.'
