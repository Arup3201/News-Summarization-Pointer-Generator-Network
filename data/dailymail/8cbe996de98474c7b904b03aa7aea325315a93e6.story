Prince Charles has arrived in the Middle East for a six-day tour that starts in Jordan - a country still in shock following the shocking murder of one of its pilots. 

The Prince of Wales stepped from his chartered jet looking relaxed and was greeted by a small entourage that included Britain's ambassador to Jordan, Peter Millett.

Jordan as a nation is grieving after the brutal killing of 26-year-old Moaz al Kasasbeh by the Islamic State (ISIS) group.

In gruesome footage, the terrorist group filmed the Jordanian pilot being burnt alive.

Following the sickening murder, Jordan's ruler King Abdullah II vowed to wage a 'harsh' war against ISIS and fighter jets carried out fresh attacks on ISIS on Thursday.  

More than 600,000 Syrian refugees have fled to Jordan to escape the civil war in their homeland, and in the past year large numbers of Syrian Christians have arrived following religious persecution by ISIS fighters.

When Charles stepped on to the tarmac at Marka airport, he was greeted by the king's religious adviser Prince Ghazi Bin Muhammad and the two men walked along a red carpet that led from the plane to the Prince of Wales's waiting limousine.

Their path was flanked by a ceremonial guard of honour which earlier had saluted the royal visitor.

Charles then met Iraqi Christian refugees at the British ambassador's residence in Amman.

The prince has been raising the plight of Orthodox Christians forced to flee their homes in Iraq and Syria by visiting, over the past year, those who have sought refuge in the UK.

One of the refugees gave a speech about their plight telling Charles: 'This is the seventh month that we are away from our homes and we don't find any reason to return back.

'Moreover we don't want to do that because it is impossible to live with the people who destroyed our homes and destroyed our church.

'Those people were our neighbours whom we lived together many years ago but when Daesh (Islamic State) came, they directly became our enemy. And they deprived us of everything. So how can we return back and co exist with such people?'

The Prince of Wales told the group of around ten people he met: 'This is what I think must be the worst of horrors when all the people you lived with, side by side and have always been friendly, suddenly totally change.' 

Charles will be joined in Jordan by International Development secretary Justine Greening as her department has provided financial aid to the country.

The Prince will also hold  talks with the king tomorrow, with the civil war in Syria likely to be one of the topics under discussion.

Amnesty International UK has appealed to Charles to use his influence and 'pass on a few well chosen words' as he tours the Gulf, and raise the case of jailed Saudi blogger Raif Badawi, who faces a decade behind bars and 1,000 lashes.

Kate Allen, Amnesty International UK director, said: 'We don't expect Prince Charles to give up the red carpets and state banquets and become a human rights campaigner, but as a man who knows the Middle East well we hope that he will use this visit to pass on a few well-chosen words to his royal hosts.

'We know that freedom of religion is an issue close to the Prince's heart, and in Saudi Arabia he will surely want to raise the outrageous case of Raif Badawi, the blogger jailed and flogged for discussing politics and religion on his website.

'We still need the UK government to do more on Raif's case, but Charles' diplomatic intercession could help secure this man's freedom.'

The Prince's tour of the Middle East will see him travel to Kuwait, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates after Jordan.
