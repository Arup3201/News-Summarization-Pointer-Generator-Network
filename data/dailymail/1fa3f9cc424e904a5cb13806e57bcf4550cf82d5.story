Liverpool and Barcelona will open negotiations over the proposed £80million transfer of disgraced star Luis Suarez.

Sportsmail understands Liverpool officials, including managing director Ian Ayre, have agreed to meet Raul Sanllehi, Barcelona’s director of football management, in London to discuss their valuation of the 27-year-old.

Barcelona are looking to strike a compromise of around £60m, based on the fact that Suarez is banned from football for the next four months following his bite on Italy’s Giorgio Chiellini.

Liverpool will not be swayed from their valuation of Suarez but will revive their interest in Barcelona forward Alexis Sanchez as part of the negotiations.

Barcelona value the Chile international at £35m following his performances in the World Cup and have already rejected a £20m offer from Juventus for the 25-year-old.

Suarez set the wheels in motion for his transfer after apologising on Monday for his attack on Chiellini.

The Uruguayan’s statement of contrition was viewed as a necessary step by Barcelona prior to their official bid and was met warmly by sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta.

‘Suarez has shown he is humble enough to admit an error, which is very important,’ said Zubizarreta.Zubizarreta was speaking at the presentation of Barcelona’s latest signing Ivan Rakitic, whosaid Suarez’s apology ‘says a lot about him as a person’.

Suarez is understood to be taking advice from Spanish lawyer Juan de Dios Crespo to help him in his appeal against his ban. De Dios Crespo helped Barcelona fight their transfer ban for infringing regulations in signing youth-team players from abroad and is an expert on FIFA’s procedures.

Suarez’s defence is now likely to include an admission that he bit Chiellini, a display of contrition and a plea for mitigation.  

It is likely that he will face a reduced ban and could be playing for Barcelona early next season if he leaves Liverpool.

Meanwhile, Southampton's Dejan Lovren and Chelsea's Ryan Bertrand remain on Liverpool's list of defensive targets.
