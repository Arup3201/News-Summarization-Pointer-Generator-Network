A nine-month old baby is fighting for his life after being so severely malnourished he weighed the same as a newborn.

Varius Bledsoe's mother Walteria, from Houston, Texas, appeared in court yesterday accused of injury to a child by omission after her son weighed just 7lbs 9 when he was brought to hospital.

The baby should have weighed 17lb, according to the Child Protective Service (CPS) and was so malnourished he suffered renal, liver and heart failure.

Walteria Bledsoe, from Houston, is accused of causing injury to a child after her nine-month-old baby Varius was brought to hospital weighing just 7lb 9

He also needed two abdominal operations at the Memorial Hermann Hospital in November and is still being fed through a tube.

When Varius was taken to hospital by his mother his ribs were visible and his stomach was sunken.

Bledsoe, 23, appeared at court yesterday in front of District Judge Marc Carter accused of not feeding her son properly.

Chron.com quoted assistant Harris County District Attorney Alison Baimbridge as telling the court: 'The child, at nine months old, weighs what a newborn would weigh.

'It appears to be fairly severe. The child was severely malnourished.'

His mother said the baby was born premature at 28 weeks and weighed just 5lb when he released at ten weeks old.

Varius was about 10lb underweight when he arrived at Memorial Hermann Hospital in Houston and had to have two abdominal operations

Bledsoe said Varius could not keep formula down and a family member suggested she try to feed him evaporated milk instead.

Child Protective Services have since removed the baby and his two siblings from Bledsoe and placed them in foster care.

The arrest warrant stated Bledsoe did know he was small but not so much that he should be considered malnourished.

She said her other children and their father were also small.

After the hearing, the defendant's sister Tasha Bledsoe told Chron.com: 'He's not bad, like they say.

'My sister is a good mother.'

Bledsoe was released on a $20,000 bond but faces life in prison if convicted of the first-degree felony.Â
