Federal officials who investigated the deadly TWA flight 800 crash that killed 230 people have insisted it was an accident after a documentary claimed the plane was hit by explosions outside the aircraft.

Current and former federal officials said yesterday they stand by their conclusion that the fatal explosion  was caused by overheated fuel tank vapors, and not a bomb or missile.

The officials spoke to reporters yesterday at a briefing on the National Transportation Safety Board's four-year investigation following the explosion and crash of the Boeing 747 off Long Island, N.Y., on July 17, 1996.

The crash - the third-deadliest aviation accident in U.S. history - occurred just 12 minutes after take-off from JFK International Airport on the flight bound for Paris, France.

Theories have suggested it was a missile 
strike from a terrorist or U.S. Navy 
vessel, and that the incident was subject to a government 
cover-up.

The board took the usual step of 
organizing the briefing on an investigation that has been closed for 
years in response to the documentary set to air this month on the 17th 
anniversary of the tragedy.

The film says new evidence points to the often-discounted theory that a missile strike may have downed the jumbo jet.

The officials who spoke at the 
briefing dismissed allegations of a cover-up, saying that the evidence 
points strongly to the board's conclusion that overheated gases in the 
plane's near-empty fuel tank caused the tank to explode.

The gases were most likely ignited by a spark from damaged wiring in a fuel measuring system.

Joseph Kolly, the current director of
 the board's Office of Research and Engineering, was the chief fire and 
explosives investigator on the flight 800 investigation. He said he is 'absolutely' certain the fuel tank was the cause.

'We went to the 'nth degree, and then some,' he said, laying out the different facets of the investigation.

Investigators tested shoulder-fired 
missiles to see if they would show up on radar and used another 747 to 
replicate the overheating of fuel tank vapors, among other tests.

'I am upset about bringing this back 
up, for the sake of the people who lost folks in the accident,' Kolly 
said. 'It's not good.' Two family members of those killed attended the 
briefing.

Investigators who worked on the plane following the crash and co-producer Tom Stalcup, said there was no evidence that the explosion came from the wing tank

Federal officials say they stand by claim that crash caused by fuel vapors ignited by faulty wiring. Images from the documentary show damaged seats on the plane, aboard which 230 people died

'I think they did a complete and 
thorough investigation in the beginning,' said Matthew Ziemkiewicz of 
Rutherford, N.J., whose sister, Jill, was a flight attendant on the 
plane.

'These are old conspiracy theories that have been around since the beginning.'

Jim Hurd of Severn, Md., who lost his
 29-year-old son, James, said the board's investigation seems 'pretty 
cut and dried as far as I'm concerned.

'But there are still family members who believe it was brought down by a bomb. I respect that.'

The documentary features interviews 
with key members of the original investigation team, who now claim
 that their investigation was systematically undermined.

'This
 team of investigators who actually handled the wreckage and victims' 
bodies, prove that the officially proposed fuel-air explosion did not 
cause the crash,' said the film's producers.

'They also provide radar and forensic
 evidence proving that one or more ordinance explosions outside the 
aircraft caused the crash.'

NTSB officials involved 
in the investigation who were not at the briefing have also defended its
 handling, describing the investigation as one of the most extensive and
 exhaustive in the board's history.

The board issued a 400-page report on the accident, accompanied by more than 17,000 pages of supporting material.

But there have long been doubters. 
They include three former investigators - one from the NTSB, one from 
TWA and one from the Air Line Pilots Association - who appear in the 
film.

The former investigators have also signed a petition filed with the NTSB to reconsider reopen the probe.

Kelly Nantel, a spokeswoman for the 
board, said they are considering the petition and has asked parties to 
the original investigation for their comments.

A decision on whether to reopen the 
investigation will be made by board officials who were not part of the 
original investigation and were not part of yesterday's briefing, she 
said.

One of the former investigators who 
signed the petition, Hank Hughes, was in charge of reconstructing the 
interior of the aircraft cabin for NTSB from debris recovered from the 
ocean.

Hughes said the board 'completely 
discounted' the accounts of more than 200 witnesses who say they saw a 
streak of light heading toward the plane before it broke apart.

Hughes said the plane's reconstructed
 fuselage - which reporters were allowed to view after the briefing - 
has holes consistent with what would be expected from missile shrapnel.

Reporters were not able to see the 
holes, he said, because they were on the opposite side of the 
reconstructed plane, facing away from the board's briefing area.

Hughes offered no explanation why his former colleagues would deliberately ignore important evidence.

'As far as motivation, who did what and why, we didn't get into that. I don't know.'

But officials at the briefing and 
other former NTSB investigators said an examination of witness 
statements showed that what people thought might be a missile was 
actually the trajectory of the plane after the fiery explosion, the 
force of which broke off some pieces of the aircraft while much of the 
remainder of the plane was propelled up and forward, before plunging 
into the ocean.

Witnesses 'legitimately saw flames 
coming down and everything else, and explosions, but it occurred after 
the initial center fuel tank explosion,' Tom Haueter, who recently 
retired as head of NTSB's aviation office and was a senior investigator 
during the flight 800 investigation, said in an interview.

The documentary airs on the EPIX premium television channel.
