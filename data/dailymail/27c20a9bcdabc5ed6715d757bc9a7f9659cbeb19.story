It's not every day that you enter into battle with Lewis Hamilton on a race track, and it's not every day that you beat him either. 

So, with that in mind, my very intimate karting date with the Mercedes superstar earlier this month must be considered an enormous success.

Move over, Hamilton; Britain has a new racing star in town.

It's the beginning of June, and I am on the outskirts of Hertfordshire at Rye House Karting track, a venue which is now synonymous with the motoring birth place of Hamilton.

While there is moisture in the air, and the clouds are darkening, for now it is dry.  

The brief is simple; we would contest a 15-minute qualifying session to decide the order of the grid before participating in a race of the same duration. 

Hamilton, who started his career here at the tender age of just eight, would start from the back of the pack. 

This was the 2008 world champion's stomping ground when he was growing up. It is a track he knows well, and one that we didn't. Perhaps he felt he needed a challenge? 

After securing pole ahead of my Fleet Street rivals, I knew the start to this most surreal of races would be imperative. 

Sitting stationary on the grid and waiting for my competitors to take up their respective positions, my heart begins to pound through my overalls and my breathing intensifies. 

But suddenly, the green flag drops and 
we're racing. I pull immediately to my left to secure the racing line 
ahead of the opening, long, sweeping right hander.

From the back: Hamilton, in his shiny white Mercedes overalls and golden helmet, prepares to go

It's a promising start, and with a quick glance over my shoulder, I see the field jostling for position behind me. 

While we're all dressed in black, Hamilton, in his shiny white Mercedes overalls and golden helmet, is already on the move.

It's a scruffy start to the race. I miss both apexes at the ensuing two hairpins, but as we enter the pit straight for the first time, somehow I have managed to retain the lead of the race. 

I glance around once more, and the yellow flags are out. There has been an accident at the back of the pack, but Hamilton has emerged from the melee unscathed, and from what I can see, it appears as though he is already up to fourth.

I knew it wouldn't be long before the 29-year-old would be breathing down my neck.

No fair: Hamilton knows the Rye House Karting track well as he levels with our man on a bend

We're midway through the second lap, and indeed here he comes. As we exit the hairpin, Hamilton gets the better drive and draws alongside me. 

We glide along the pit-straight and look directly at one other, before he gestures that I take the corner ahead of him by holding out his left hand. I'm sure that's the first, and probably only time, he's ever done that in his motor racing career. 

'What a gent', I think, only to realise that his act of goodwill is for his own personal pleasure.

Indeed, he would spend the course of the lap toying with me; much in the same vein as my pet cat does with her prey in the garden.

In this case, I am the helpless mouse. Hamilton knows he will get me eventually, but he is going to make sure he has fun doing it.

He relentlessly bumps the back of my kart along the back straight - a tactic he says he employed throughout his junior career - before diving underneath me at the right hander and securing the lead of the race.

Joker: Hamilton toyed with the racers on track like a cat does with its prey in the garden

My resistance lasted the best part of 1600 metres, some 85 seconds, but in the blink of an eye it is over, and Hamilton sails off into the distance despite my best efforts to cling on to the back of his four-stroke engine.

Fortunately, the Mercedes man's charitable side returns, and he slows down to let his flock of sheep catch up. 

His act of kindness ultimately allows me to clinch the win. A false victory perhaps, but I'll always be able to tell the story of the day I beat Lewis Hamilton. 

'You're all pretty bad at karting,' Hamilton says afterwards as we catch our breath in the clubhouse. He turns to his left, before addressing my Daily Telegraph colleague and I: 'You two were OK.'

It's not exactly a glowing endorsement, but it will do.

Until next time, Lewis…

End: Hamilton didn't win, albeit because of his charitable side, and let our man catch up to pass first

Verdict: Hamilton said Duncan and one of his fellow racers 'were OK' after the race
