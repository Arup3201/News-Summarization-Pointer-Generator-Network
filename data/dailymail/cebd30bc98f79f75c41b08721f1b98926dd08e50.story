The fall-out from England’s World Cup fiasco will not include an official FA report into exiting the tournament after two games.

Instead, the FA will review all aspects of  the Brazil experience on a continuous basis building towards Euro 2016 - but without any special document detailing what went wrong.

This differs from the approach after the poor show at South Africa 2010, when the now defunct FA International Committee still had power and manager Fabio Capello delivered a tournament report to them.

The end of the world: Roy Hodgson walks onto the pitch after a dismal draw against Costa Rica

Some not only wanted Capello sacked but asked for future managers to be hired on a  tournament-to-tournament basis.

By contrast, the Club England group who run the national team have already, in their wisdom, contracted Roy Hodgson to Euro 2016. 

But even if there is no opposition within the FA to Hodgson remaining in charge, there are sure to be demands that the World Cup debacle is properly investigated.

Fifa president Sepp Blatter has kept such a low profile at the World Cup - avoiding big-screen appearances at matches to avoid the inevitable booing - that there is speculation he has hardly attended a game.

However FIFA say Blatter has attended seven matches - Brazil v Mexico, Switzerland v Ecuador, Germany v Portugal, Spain v Chile, Honduras v Ecuador, Nigeria v Bosnia and Belgium v Russia.

Meanwhile Michel Platini, who is looking increasingly likely to stand against Blatter for the FIFA presidency in 2015, is not taking advantage of his rival staying under cover.

The Frenchman is not even in Brazil, although he’ll return for the quarter-finals.

There remains frustration in Belo Horizonte that the England team chose not to make the city their World Cup base when Team GB and the British Paralympians will have their training camps in Belo ahead of the Rio Olympics. 

Hotel standards and a lack of attractions for the players compared to Rio are understood to be among the reasons for the FA going elsewhere. But the BOA and the BPA are satisfied with  their proposed accommodation and Belo point to Uruguay, Chile and Argentina, who are all still in the World Cup, choosing to stay with them.

Mark England, the BOA chef de mission for the Rio Olympics, intends to pick the brain of former colleague Dave Reddin as to what went pear-shaped with England’s World Cup challenge.

Reddin was head of performance services at the BOA before joining the FA in the same capacity last February, charged with improving the team’s record at major championships.

Reddin is keen on the back-up of a legion of sports scientists ‘underpinned with the latest research’, which worked for Team GB in 2012 but definitely didn’t work for the footballers at Brazil 2014.

USA’s World Cup fever

The United States might finally be embracing football, judging by the remarkable 18.2million ESPN viewers for the country’s 2-2 draw with Portugal. This was a bigger rating than for any of the recent NBA series finals between Miami Heat and San Antonio Spurs.

ESPN’s figures are 36 per cent up on South Africa 2010, and rivals NBC have also enjoyed huge audiences for Premier League coverage.  Another sign of the way ‘soccer’ is finally gripping America, seven years after David Beckham joined LA Galaxy, was 10,000 fans watching the Portugal game on a giant screen in Grant Park, Chicago.

A notable World Cup PR coup is the way London-based agency Vero, who represent Belo Horizonte, have milked every publicity opportunity out of 79-year-old local Elmo, who was a ball boy when England were beaten by the United States in 1950. 

The omnipresent Elmo - there may be more than one of them - apparently turned down being feted by Coca-Cola and FIFA at a ball-boy tournament in Rio so he could keep pressing the flesh in Belo with England in town.
