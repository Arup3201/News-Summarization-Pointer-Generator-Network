Estimate, one of the best horses ever owned by the Queen, could have run her last race after trailing home last behind Cavalryman in the Artemis Goodwood Cup.

Nine days after making global headlines when it emerged she was one of seven horses to test positive to Morphine — a case linked to contaminated feed which means she will be disqualified from her second place in the Ascot Gold Cup in June — the Sir Michael Stoute-trained mare, ridden by Ryan Moore, appeared ill-at-ease on Goodwood’s gradients and never looked like justifying her position as 2-1 favourite. It was a second career defeat at the track, with Estimate (below) having finished third in the 2012 Lily Langtree Stakes.

It is understood the horse was one of the runners in the Goodwood Cup line-up subject to a post-race dope test. Given the backdrop to the race, the BHA had little option. It was entirely a cosmetic but necessary procedure to head off any conspiracy theorists.

With running options now thin on the ground, retirement is now a big option. That would be a sad end to a career for a mare who gave her owner one of her most joyous days on a racecourse with victory in the 2013 Ascot Gold Cup.

Certainly plans for an exciting potential swansong in Australia’s Melbourne Cup in November look certain to be shelved. Stoute said: ‘Ryan said she wasn’t letting herself down and I wasn’t happy from a long way out.’

Royal racing adviser John Warren added: ‘We were hopeful that if she did well that we would be brave enough to go to the Irish St Leger to sharpen her up and see if she had enough toe for Melbourne. Now we are back to the drawing board. The option are so limited. We will have to see what the Queen thinks.’

A second shot at the Melbourne Cup is a possibility for Godolphin-owned Cavalryman, who finished a neck in front of Saeed Bin Suroor-trained stablemate Ahzeemah.

Third, four and a half lengths further back in a race run at an uneven tempo, was Michael Owen-owned 2013 winner Brown Panther.

Definitely retired is Michael Winter-trained Missunited. The Irish mare, who was third in the Ascot Gold Cup, sustained a suspensory ligament injury when bravely winning the Lily Langtree Stakes under Jim Crowley.

A sense of excitement swept the track when it emerged film star Tom Cruise was a guest of Goodwood’s owner Lord March. He generated a frenzy of attention when presenting model Edie Campbell with her prize for winning the charity Magnolia Cup.

Cruise is best known for his Mission: Impossible films and trainer Richard Hannon must have felt that finding a winner was getting that way after five seconds on the opening two days. But the tide turned as his two-year-olds Shagah and Ivawood scored under Richard Hughes.

The latter, impressive in the Group Two Richmond Stakes, is 8-1 favourite for next year’s 2,000 Guineas with Ladbrokes.
