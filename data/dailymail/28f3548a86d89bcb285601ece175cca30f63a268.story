British troops have been attacking Taliban fighters in secret raids months after the military officially stopped offensive operations in Afghanistan.

Paratroopers and Royal Marines in the Special Forces Support Group have teamed up with Afghan commandos in Helmand province.

The elite fighters take on Taliban bomb-makers, launching several raids a week in an attempt to drive the extremists out of the area.

Details of the previously unknown operations were revealed by a senior officer in the unit writing in Pegasus, the Parachute Regiment's in-house journal.

He wrote that the SFSG's A Company was deployed to Afghanistan in January for a six-month tour, during which it was involved in two or three offensives against the Taliban each week.

Up to 150 British troops joined up with Task Force 444, a group of elite commandos from the Afghan National Army, according to the Daily Telegraph.

They aimed to cripple the Taliban's bomb-making abilities and block insurgents' supply lines near the border with Pakistan, according to the anonymous officer.

He revealed his satisfaction at taking part in combat operations, writing: 'Killing the enemy in the close battle is exactly what we joined up to do.'

Pledge: Officers and ministers have insisted that the British forces are no longer involved in combat

The officer also praised the men from the unit, saying they were working 'above their pay grade' and had impressed their fellow fighters.

However, he added that 'the Afghanistan burden is heavy', with many Afghan soldiers killed in action and British troops suffering 'life-changing injuries'.

Earlier this year, senior military commanders claimed that British forces were no longer involved in combat operations in Helmand, after more than a decade of fighting in the region.

Officials have insisted that the Afghan army is now in control of operations, with British troops taking an advisory role.

However, the latest revelation casts doubt on that claim, suggesting that British forces are still fighting on the front line.

All Nato combat troops are due to leave Afghanistan by the end of next year, leaving only support staff advising the country's military.
