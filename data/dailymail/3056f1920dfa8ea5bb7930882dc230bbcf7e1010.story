Britain's fattest dog is on a crash diet because the owner kept forgetting he’d already been fed.

Alfie the labrador weighed in at 12st 5lb (80kg) when the RSPCA took him in.

That’s almost three times the normal weight of a labrador - and as heavy as Manchester United forward Wayne Rooney.

It took four people using towels as slings to lift him when he arrived at the RSPCA’s Leybourne Animal Centre, in Kent.

Britain's former fattest dog Alfie weighed 12.5 stone last year - as much as Wayne Rooney before arriving at the RSPCA's door for help

The 12-year-old canine was signed over to the RSPCA after his elderly owner kept forgetting he had already fed his pet.

Christine Dooley, centre manager, said: 'He literally could not stand up when he arrived because he was so fat. I have never seen a dog that fat before in my 27 years with the RSPCA, he must be Britain’s fattest pet.

'He was just a massive blob with a leg at each corner.

'He was being fed to death, it’s amazing he was alive given his size. A healthy Labrador weighs about 30 kilos (4stone 7lbs), so poor Alfie was carrying the weight of two Labradors, and a Staffie too.'

Alfie struggled to walk more than a few steps and could not even lift his legs a couple of inches into a raised bed in his kennel - so staff at the centre made him comfortable with a piece of carpet and blankets on the floor.

Alfie's s neck is so big wears the same size collar as a St Bernard.

Alfie was passed to the RSPCA after his elderly owner kept forgetting he had already fed his pet.

He has been put on a carefully calorie controlled diet with two meals a day, weekly weigh-ins and strictly no treats.

His obesity means he pants when he breathes and he may have damaged his joints and suffered pressure sores on his legs.

Since arriving at the centre in March this year he has lost about four and a half stone. This means he is more than half way to his target weight.

Wayne Rooney weighs the same as Alfie.

Christine said: 'When he first came in he couldn’t go on walks because of his size but each day as the weight is coming off he is able to take a few steps further. We have to be careful when staff take him for a walk because if he sits down and refuses to get back up we have to call in extra people to lift him up again.

'We want the weight to come off slowly to give his leg muscles a chance to build up strength and for his skin to shrink. We cannot foster him out yet because he wouldn’t be able to get him into the back of a car.

'He’s such a lovely dog and his tail never stops wagging, everyone here has fallen in love with him.'

Once Alfie has reached a manageable weight staff at the centre near Maidstone, Kent, will start looking for a home for him. His new owner will need to keep up his healthy diet and gentle exercise regime.

Although Alfie’s obesity is extreme it appears to be a growing problem among dogs. Since 2009 the number of complaints and calls the RSPCA has received about fat, obese and overweight dogs has steadily increased from about 20 a month to more than 30.

RSPCA Inspector Caroline Doe, based in Kent, said over indulging a pet is just as harmful as not feeding them enough.

She said: 'Alfie’s case is exceptional, I’ve never seen a dog that big before, but there are lots of dogs out there which are overweight or obese.

'People don’t seem to realise it’s a problem because they think they are showing their pets love by giving them treats and titbits

'In fact in terms of causing suffering, allowing your dog to become extremely obese is just as damaging as starving it and letting it get very skinny.'
