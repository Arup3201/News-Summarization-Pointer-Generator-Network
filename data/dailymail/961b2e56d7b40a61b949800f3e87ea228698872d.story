Crystal Palace are among the clubs keen on Brede Hangeland after it emerged the defender was released by Fulham via email.

The departing captain had a year remaining on his deal at Craven Cottage but had his contract ripped up following relegation to the Premier League.

And Hangeland claims the west Londoners gave him no warning before cutting their ties short after six-and-a-half years of service while he was enjoying an off-season holiday in the Indian Ocean.

On his way: Brede Hangeland has been released by Fulham

‘Today I received the news that Fulham has chosen to cancel my contract with the club with immediate effect,’ he said, via adviser Jon Morland.

‘I was notified of the decision via email, without anyone from the club meeting with me beforehand to discuss my contract or future at the club.

‘After six-and-a-half years of loyal and hard work, the last years as captain, I am immensely disappointed by how this was handled.’

However, Fulham say the 32-year-old knew his fate before they made their announcement.

Hangeland is also understood to have 
ignored requests to get in touch with manager Felix Magath and was 
reluctant to commit to a future in the Championship in meetings held 
last month.

The defender took time out of his holiday to thank Fulham’s supporters, despite the disappointing nature of his departure from the club.

‘I would like to thank the fantastic Fulham fans who I’ve got to spend the best years of my football career with.

'I have worn the white shirt with 
pride at Craven Cottage. I feel I still have much to give as a football 
player, and look forward to the next chapter in my career.’

The
 towering Norweigan centre-back had been linked with a move to Arsenal 
before signing a new three-year deal with the Cottagers in 2012 and 
Palace could offer him the chance to remain in the top flight now he is a free
 agent.
