A severed cat's head spotted in a Connecticut town is the third to be discovered in the state in the last year.

The latest gruesome incident in Fairfield comes just over a week after a similar find in Oxford.

Police said a homeowner in the town reported noticing the cat's head in the backyard of his property on Saturday.

A number of severed cat heads have now been found in Connecticut sparking fears a person is responsible for the killings

Mark Piers, who made the discovery, said it was a 'scary' find:

'The weirdest thing about it is that it was clean-cut,' he told NBC News.

By the time animal control officers arrived the next day, however, it had disappeared.

Resident Steve Meszaros said he's worried a person may be responsible for the gruesome killings.

Speaking to NBC, he said: 'I was more concerned about the coyotes to begin with, but...someone's severing cat heads.

'That scares me even more.'

Authorities have said they do not believe the most recent killing could have been the result of an animal attack.

Despite the reports of the latest 
incident, the Fairfield Police Department have said they cannot 
investigate due to a lack of evidence.

In Oxford, Connecticut, a similar discovery of a severed cat's head was found on July 7th.

It was the second such killing in the neighbourhood in the last seven months.

The grey and white tabby cat's head was placed in the middle of a street in what was believed to be a deliberate act.

Assistant animal control officer Cori Wlasuk told Oxford Patch, a local news site: 'The eyes were looking up at you, it was disgusting.'
