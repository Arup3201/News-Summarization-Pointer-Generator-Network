A group of Amazon warehouse workers in South Carolina are suing the world’s biggest online retailer claiming that the company's workplace policies don't leave them with enough time to eat their lunches.

The lawsuit, the latest in a string of cases brought against Amazon over worker’s rights, claims that retailer is violating federal wage and hour laws.

The claims made by the seven warehouse workers offers a fascinating insight into the retail giant's working processes.

A group of Amazon warehouse workers in South Carolina are suing the world¿s biggest online retailer claiming that the company's workplace policies don't leave them with enough time to eat their lunches

Staff are allotted an unpaid 30 minute break during the working day, but according to the lawsuit they were required to continue working and complete their tasks even after their lunch breaks had began.

Next they would have to wait in line to go through a security screening. Amazon has employees pass through metal 
detectors and subjects them to searches to prevent shrinkage – a retail 
industry term for merchandise theft. This process could take five minutes, states the lawsuit.

Then because of the sheer scale of the Amazon's warehouse - or Fulfillment Center - in West Columbia it would take the workers a good seven minutes to walk outside to get some fresh air and eat their lunch.

Typically workers were left with ‘less than 18 minutes’ to enjoy their lunches before having to get back to picking and packing goods, according to the suit.

Amazon workers get an unpaid 30 minute break during the day, but that includes enduring lengthy security checks

According to this latest lawsuit, these are the steps that Amazon workers must go through as part of their unpaid 30 minute lunch break:

‘Workers were unable to pursue their mealtime adequately and comfortably,’ the complaint states.

What's more, the workers claim those lunch breaks were interrupted by managers reprimanding them for failing to meet quotas out on the floor.

‘Managers and Supervisors sometimes approach Warehouse Workers during Defendant's designated break period to give them written warnings and assign disciplinary points to them for [failing] to maintain the Defendants' productivity goals during the shift,’ the complaint states.

Amazon commonly uses temp workers in its warehouses, and the South Carolina complaint names two temp firms, Staff Management and SMX, in addition to Seattle-based Amazon.

The seven plaintiffs, William Johnson, Tyrone Fisher, Brian Gunter, Lester Mayo, Jeffrey Hope, Latoshia Mack, and Christina Thomas, are all from Richland County, South Carolina.

According to the lawsuit all worked at the Amazon facility in West Columbia at one time or anther over the past four years.

As many as ten similar lawsuits were filed last year in states including Nevada, Washington, Tennessee and Pennsylvania. All the lawsuits complained about how the security checkpoints ate into the worker's personal time and demanded that workers be compensated

Initially dismissed by a Nevada judge, the employees involved in the first suit successfully appealed and are petitioning the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case, attorney Peter Winebrake told MailOnline.

‘We look forward to pursuing this class-action lawsuit in an effort to ensure that [workers] get paid for all of the time they spend on the job,’ he told the Lehigh Valley Morning Call. ‘We definitely think the case has merit.’
