A spokesman for the Royal Yachting Association (RYA) said that they were ‘deeply saddened’ to learn of Mr Plumb’s death.

John Derbyshire, the RYA racing manager and performance director, said: ‘Howard was a talented windsurfer who represented his country at the 1996 Olympics, the highest level.

‘He will be remembered for his disposition which endeared him to all that he met as a genuinely likeable man, who turned his passion for competitive windsurfing into another physical sport, cycling, which he enjoyed immensely.

‘Those that he touched will miss him enormously.’

A 54-year-old man from Sweden who was arrested on suspicion of driving without due care and attention has been released on bail until November 13.
