This is the meerkat who deserves an Asbo after who has playfully terrorising his neighbours since being rescued from the desert.

Little Jan may look adorable but he likes nothing more than playing rough with dogs, cats and even peacocks.

The six-month-old orphan was found weak and motherless wandering through the Kalahari desert in Namibia.

He was saved and brought back to the Okambara Lodge, where he has earned a reputation for mischievous behaviour with both animals and people.

Photographer Barbara Scheer captured these images while on a visit with her husband Udo.

'Jan is nearly too tame,' said Jan, from Wuppertal, Germany.

'He is naughty, absolutely fearless and plays rough with the cat and the dogs of the farm.

'He seems to mistake laces for worms and snakes and is totally attracted to them, opening the shoes of anyone in the lodge.

'Folks with sandals are treated even worse by Jan - he loves to bite into toes.

'The peacock also suffers from Jan's surprising and playful attacks.'

However, there is one animal at the lodge who does not take any nonsense.

Warthgog 'Schweini' bit Jan and he had to be stitched up by the vets and spend 10 days recovering in a box.

But he was soon back to his old tricks, according to Christian Schmitt, owner of the lodge.

He said: 'Ten days of arrest did not correct Jans behaviour - for us he is the fright of the Kalahari.'
