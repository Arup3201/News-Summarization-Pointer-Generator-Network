Courts should have the power to quiz all defendants - and witnesses - on their use of internet porn, a top lawyer said today.

Nick Freeman - the solicitor dubbed Mr Loophole - said it was outrageous that the jury in the Jo Yeates murder trial couldn't hear about Vincent Tabak's interest in images of women being throttled - yet Milly Dowler's father was hounded over his interest in bondage when his daughter's killer was in court.

He says judges should not be allowed to decide whether evidence relating to pornography is admissible and believes a blanket ruling should allow lawyers to quiz any defendant or witness on pornography, providing it is relevant to the case. 

Not happy: Lawyer Nick Freeman, left, says it's outrageous that the jury in the Jo Yeates murder trial couldn't hear about Vincent Tabak's interest in hardcore porn

He believes it is the only way to 'smash this disgraceful contradiction', especially in view of the fact that more than a third of UK internet users view porn online.

Writing in his Manchester Evening News column today Mr Freeman  said: 'In my view, anyone watching internet porn should know that if they subsequently become a defendant or witness in criminal proceedings, their cyber spectating could be open to questioning in court, if relevant to the charge.'

In the Jo Yeates murder case, the judge at Bristol Crown Court refused to let prosecutors reveal Tabak's interest in hardcore porn.

In the weeks after the killing he visited sites which showed men choking women during sex, images of other women tied up in car boots and others being bound and gagged.

Changes needed?: Although he was only a prosecution witness, Bob Dowler, pictured here with his wife Sally, was forced to admit at his daughter's murder trial that police had found pornographic material in his possession

In the trial of Levi Bellfield in June, the father of his victim Milly Dowler broke down in tears as he endured hours of questioning about pornography and bondage equipment found at his home.

Mr Freeman says: 'Though only a prosecution witness at his daughter`s murder trial, Bob Dowler was forced to admit in open court that police had found pornographic material in his possession.

'Many leading commentators stormed that this was an intrusion too far for a grief-stricken parent traumatised by his daughter`s killing.'

By contrast, he says the withholding of evidence relating to Tabak's porn interest was an 'outrage'.

He says: 'His predilection for hard-core and violent pornography - including images of women being held by the neck saying "choke me" - was kept from the jury in the Jo Yeates murder case.

'An outrage since in my mind this was a scorching piece of evidence which directly played to the mindset of the accused.

'Without it, the Crown just about limped home with a conviction after the jury deliberated for two days before returning a 10 - 2 majority.'

Ever been tempted to look at porn on the internet?

After all, pornography is viewed by 35.9 per cent of UK internet users.

It's unlikely many of these are more than casual sauce-surfers, idling away a few moments of spare time over their lunchtime pot noodle.

Certainly - or rather, hopefully - very few, fuelled by a cyber-fix, would develop a thirst for violence or even murder.

Unfortunately, it did in the case of Vincent Tabak. And yet his predilection for hard-core and violent pornography - including images of women being held by the neck saying 'choke me` - was kept from the jury in the Jo Yeates murder case.

An outrage since in my mind this was a scorching piece of evidence which directly played to the mindset of the accused.

Without it, the Crown just about limped home with a conviction after the jury deliberated for two days before returning a 10 - 2 majority. A very close call for the Crown.

Square that with the experience of Milly Dowler`s father.

Though only a prosecution witness at his daughter`s murder trial, Bob Dowler was forced to admit in open court that police had found pornographic material in his possession.

Many leading commentators stormed that this was an intrusion too far for a grief-stricken parent traumatised by his daughter`s killing.

It`s time to smash this disgraceful contradiction by carving the legal position in statute.

In my view, anyone watching internet porn should know that if they subsequently become a defendant or witness in criminal proceedings, their cyber spectating could be open to questioning in court, if relevant to the charge.

Every day minds are polluted by the toxic trash being pedalled on the web. Yet the law seems to protect a violent killer tanked up on gruesome internet footage whilst exposing an innocent witness for his lamentable sexual interest.

At the moment a judge has a discretion to make this call. It`s not enough. If he errs on the side of caution, suppresses evidence arbitrarily and gets it wrong, a vicious murderer could walk free.

The scales of justice between the probative and the prejudicial need to be rebalanced. The law needs to stand as a serious deterrent.

There are 755 million porn-heavy pages on the web, generating £60billion a year in filth-soaked revenue. And nearly 36 per cent of the population are looking at it. One of them could be you.

Would you take a peek if you knew your secret wasn`t safe?
