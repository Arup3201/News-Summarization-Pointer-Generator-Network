When six-year-old Oliver Hudd set out for the first time to find some treasure with his new metal detector he could never have imagined what he was about to discover.

After just a few sweeps of the ground, the youngster unearthed an 8lb First World War bomb - resulting in the bomb squad evacuating the area.

Oliver had been looking for Roman coins in his grandad's back garden in Dartford, Kent, with his dad Jason when the drama began.

The family had been enjoying Mother's Day when Oliver and his dad rushed back into the house and dialled 999.

Kent Police arrived at the house at 5pm on Sunday and cordoned off the road while the bomb disposal squad checked the device.

The bomb shell was found not to contain any explosives but the family say they have been told not to dig in the garden anymore incase they find a live one.

Mother-of-two Jenny Smith, 36, said: 'We couldn't believe it. The first time he goes out with his metal detector and finds that.

'Jason was using it for a bit without any luck, but as soon as Oliver touched it, it started beeping.

'He dug down and felt the spade hit metal. He kept digging and hit it a good few times with the spade before seeing the pointed end and realising it looked like a bomb.'

At first the family thought it was an old baked bean tin but they phoned the police to check.

'Oliver was so excited, running around the house shouting "we found a bomb"', said Ms Smith.

'But my three-year-old daughter Josie was scared and clinging to me.

'I think Oliver reckons he's always going to be finding exciting things now - a bomb in every field.'

Jenny and engineer Jason, from South Darenth, Kent, asked if Oliver could keep the shell as a souvenir but bomb disposal experts said he was not allowed to.

Oliver has been showing off pictures of his amazing discovery to his friends at school during show and tell.

His mother added: 'The bomb disposal experts confirmed that it was a First World War bomb.

'The bomb disposal units weren't sure why it was there - if it was a dud-bomb or a training tool - but they've told us not to dig up the area anymore in case there are more bombs, and with explosives in this time.'
