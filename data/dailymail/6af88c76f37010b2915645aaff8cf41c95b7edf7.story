A husband and father of three officially has the World's Widest Tongue, according to Guinness World Records.

Byron Schlenker, 46, told Syracuse.com his daughter examined the width of his tongue, after she saw the previous record listed in a copy of the Guinness Book of World Records from 2012.

Schlenker's tongue is 8.3cm wide - beating the record of 7.9cm, the website reported.

Amazing! Byron Schlenker broke the Guinness World Record for the world's widest tongue 

It's official! Schlenker and his tongue are seen inside the new edition of the Guinness Book of World Records 

Schlenker told Syracuse.com he contacted Guinness, which said he was able give money for a company employee to examine his tongue in-person - but 'just let it go and forgot about the whole thing' after discovering he was able to submit pictures himself.

Guinness later reached out to Schlenker and used 'a doctor and two notaries to measure his tongue using a hard, metal ruler,' according to the website. 

'I would have never done it if they hadn't contacted me back,' Schlenker told Syracuse.com. 'It wasn't something I'm striving for. I don't mind if someone beats my record or not.'

Speaking of his photo shoot, Schlenker told the website 'They had me licking ice cream cones and they lined up Tic Tacs across my tongue.

Strange encounters: Schlenker says people who know of his tongue have asked them to lick their books 

'I had to stick out my tongue for three hours. It's a muscle like anything else, and can get bigger. If I measure, my tongue now, it's about 8.6 cm.'

He told KEYE, saying 'People get excited and sometimes it catches you off guard. They're like, "Can you lick my book?" I'm like, "I'm not licking anything." But it's just fun.' 

Schlenker told MailOnline he saw his picture inside the book for the first time during a recent shopping trip to Target with his daughter.

Schlenker told MailOnline he did not spread the news he broke the Guinness World Record until the book was published, because the company told him people would likely come forward and try to one-up him.

He also said he didn't initially believe Guinness when he was told the media would eventually reach out and be interested in his story.

'I said, "I hadn't seen anybody do anything with their tongues besides Miley Cyrus and Gene Simmons,"' Schlenker said.

Schlenker said he agreed with commenters on the Syracuse.com story, who have been alternately grossed out and shocked by his tongue.

'I have to agree with them; it is gross,' he told MailOnline. 'But it is funny at the same time.'

Schlenker said his wife 'wasn't on board 'til Guinness [offered] to fly me to Rome for a TV special.'

'Other than that, [she thinks] this is kind of weird,' he told MailOnline. His daughters, however, think it is 'hysterical.'
