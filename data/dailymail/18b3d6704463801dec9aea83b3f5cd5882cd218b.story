Parts of the UK are at risk from further flooding today as four centimetres of rain is expected to fall in 14 hours.

The Met Office this morning issued two yellow warnings - one for south-west England and South Wales and the other for the east coast of Northern Ireland.

Up to a third of January's expected rainfall, about 3-4cm, could fall on already sodden ground. The average UK rainfall for January is 12cm.

The Environment Agency has more than 40 flood warnings in place, most of which are in the South East and South West.

Given continued saturated ground conditions, forecasters say the public should be aware of the likelihood of localised flooding.

The Met Office's warning was valid from 5am and runs until 7pm.

A spokesman said this morning: 'We are expecting persistent and heavy rain today.

'Rain, heavy and persistent in places, will continue to affect much of south-west England and South Wales this morning, slowly clearing again from the west this afternoon.

Krista Mitchell from the Met Office added: 'Given that the ground there is already quite saturated there's a risk of localised flooding.'

She said  2cm is expected but some parts could see 3cm-40cm.

The Environment Agency has 41 flood warnings - 23 in the South East, 11 in the South West, five in Anglia and two in the Midlands. There are 150 flood alerts in place.

Eight people have died and more than 1,700 homes and businesses have been flooded in England since the beginning of the Christmas period.

Despite the storms, temperatures have been relatively mild for January, with the thermometer rising as high as 10C.
