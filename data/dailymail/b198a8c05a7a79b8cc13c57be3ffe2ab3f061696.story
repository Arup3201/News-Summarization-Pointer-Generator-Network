As anger continues to swirl around syndicated radio host Rush Limbaugh after referring to a law student as a 'slut,' even the president can't keep from weighing in.

The backlash against Limbaugh has intensified in recent days, as an eighth advertiser has dropped its support of his radio program and two stations have pulled the plug on it.

Limbaugh called Georgetown student Sandra Fluke a 'slut' and a 'prostitute' last week after she urged lawmakers to consider the importance of contraception coverage in health care policy.

During President Obama's press conference today at the White House, he had little to say about the controversy at first.

Controvery: During his first press conference of 2012, President Obama weighed in on the uproar surrounding radio host Rush Limbaugh, right, after he called Sandra Fluke a 'slut' on the air

'I'm not going to comment on what sponsors decide to
do.  I'm not going to comment on either
the economics or the politics of it.  I
don't know what's in Rush Limbaugh's heart, so I'm not going to comment on the
sincerity of his apology.'

But he said that he was compelled to offer his support to Fluke after
considering his own children, daughters Malia, 13, and Sasha, 10.

Obama said: 'The reason I called Ms Fluke is because I
thought about Malia and Sasha, and one of the things I want them to do as they
get older is to engage in issues they care about, even ones I may not agree
with them on'.

Reaction: Georgetown University law student and activist Sandra Fluke speaks during an appearance on the daytime talk show, 'The View' about the comments he made on his programme

He added: 'I want them to be able to speak their mind in a
civil and thoughtful way.  And I don't
want them attacked or called horrible names because they're being good
citizens'.

And I wanted Sandra to know
that I thought her parents should be proud of her, and that we want to send a
message to all our young people that being part of a democracy involves
argument and disagreements and debate, and we want you to be engaged, and
there's a way to do it that doesn't involve you being demeaned and insulted,
particularly when you’re a private citizen'.

Meanwhile, firms are pulling sponsorship deals from Limbaugh's radio show, fans are refusing to tune in and a couple of stations have dropped its broadcast.

Carbonite, Proflowers, Tax Resolution
 Services, Legal Zoom, Citrix Success, All State, Heart and Body 
Extract, AutoZone, Quicken Loans, Sleep Train, Sleep Number, Oreck and AOL have all stopped advertising with the show.

KPUA in Hilo, Hawaii, and WBEC in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, are no longer airing it.

Listeners of smaller, local radio stations that broadcast the syndicated show are being called on to pressure advertisers to cut all ties.

Twitter users are also spreading the message using the hashtags #BoycottRush, #StopRush and #BoycottHate.

Several Facebook pages also have thousands of fans supporting the action. Limbaugh made a rare public apology on Saturday in the wake of the uproar caused by his comments.

But Fluke, who became Limbaugh's target after she testified about birth control before a Congressional panel, questioned the sincerity of the apology, adding that she did not want to hear from Limbaugh personally.

'The statements he’s made about me over the air are personal enough, so I’d rather not have a personal phone call with him,' Fluke said on ABC’s 'The View.'

Anger: Many advertisers reacted to Limbaugh's controversial 'slut' comments by suspending adverts on the programme

Decision: Citrix Systems has also decided to boycott the show

Limbaugh admitted that his 'choice of words was not the best' and couldn’t resist taking a swipe at his opponents.

'I acted too much like the leftists who despise me. I descended to their level, using names and exaggerations,' he said. 'It’s what we’ve come to expect from them, but it’s way beneath me.'

The comments have amplified an election-year clash over Obama’s plan to require health insurers to cover contraception. 

Republican presidential candidates have cast the plan as an attack on religion as they court socially conservative voters before tonight’s 10-state 'Super Tuesday' primary contest.

But they have distanced themselves from Limbaugh’s incendiary rhetoric as polls show that nearly two-thirds of voters support Obama’s plan.

Limbaugh apologised again yesterday, but continued to criticize Fluke’s efforts to force the Catholic university to include contraception in its health insurance coverage.

'If birth control insurance is important to you as an enrolling student … you might want to attend or work at a school that isn’t run by Catholics,' he said.

Limbaugh’s show is broadcast for three hours each weekday. Talkers Magazine, a broadcast industry trade publication, estimates that Limbaugh reaches at least 15million people a week, the most of any U.S. radio talk show.

Boycott: Sleep Number Sara has also decided to suspend all advertising on the show

His comments are the latest wrinkle in a battle over birth control and religious freedom that have emerged as a surprise hot-button issue in the 2012 presidential contest.

Religious organizations, the Catholic Church and social conservatives have protested Obama’s policy, which originally required all employers that provide health insurance to cover contraceptives, as an infringement on religious liberty.

Obama subsequently tweaked the policy so that religiously affiliated employers like hospitals, universities and charities would not be required to cover the cost. That did not satisfy Catholic bishops, who reject artificial contraceptives.

Republicans in Congress have unsuccessfully tried to repeal the new birth control rule, an effort that Democrats, in turn, have cast as a Republican 'war on women'.

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee says it has raised $1.6million since Fluke testified on Capitol Hill two weeks ago, tying the flurry of donations to outrage over the Republicans’ action.

'It’s a dramatic loser for the Republicans, because the vast majority of American women use birth control at some point in their lives,' said Southern Methodist University political science professor Cal Jillson.
