Gareth Bale finally helped Real Madrid fulfil the dream of 'La Decima', securing a memorable 10th Champions League triumph with an extra-time win against neighbours Atletico Madrid.

Born in Wales, raised in Southampton and honed at Tottenham, the 24-year-old continued to make light of his world-record fee by scoring a goal that will write him into club history.

Bale looked set to pay for a woeful first-half miss but instead capped a remarkable first season at Real by heading home to make it 2-1 in extra time, before Carlo Ancelotti's men eased away to a 4-1 win.
