Mario Gotze says he is relishing a huge celebration after helping Germany secure their fourth World Cup against Argentina on Sunday night.

The Bayern Munich forward netted the only goal in the 113th minute at the Maracana, sweetly volleying home from a tight angle.

And while admitting the achievement was beyond his wildest dreams, he was looking forward to a 'great party' in Brazil and back home.
