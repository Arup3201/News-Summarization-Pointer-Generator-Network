A new father was forced to deliver his baby son at home when his partner woke to discover she had gone into labour in her sleep.

Sarah Pearson woke at the couple's home in Barnsley on October 13, telling partner Graeme Smith she 'felt something weird'.

But by the time the 25-year-old realised what was happening baby Charlie was ready to make his appearance in the world.

Surprise arrival: Sarah Pearson woke up to find she was in the final stages of labour leaving partner Graeme Smith to deliver their new son Charlie at the couple's home

The couple had visited Barnsley Hospital just hours earlier when Sarah's waters broke.

But midwives, having checked her over, told them to return in 24 hours.

In anticipation of the arrival of their firstborn, the couple headed home to get some sleep.

But their nap was cut short when Sarah, an art student, woke to find she was already in labour and her baby's head was crowning.

False alarm: Miss Pearson and Mr Smith went to Barnsley Hospital the day before Charlie arrived, after Miss Pearson's waters broke. Midwives told the couple to return in 24 hours

Checking to see what the 'wierd feeling' Sarah was experiencing was, Mr Smith, 22, discovered he could see his son's head.

The DJ said: 'We had a couple of hours sleep and 
then Sarah woke me saying "what's that? It feels weird" and when I 
looked there was a head sticking out.

'I
phoned the midwife who told us to ring for an ambulance and while we 
were waiting a woman on the phone was talking me through everything, 
what to do and to get towels and things.

'She was saying "are you sure it's a head?". I said yes I'm sure, it's got hair on it.

'We
kept wondering where the ambulance was and the woman on the phone said 
we had plenty of time and they would be here soon. The next thing we 
knew Charlie was out.'

When paramedics arrived they found little Charlie, who weighed 6lbs 15oz, curled up in his mother's arms.

Mr Smith said praised Miss Pearson for her bravery in giving birth without any pain relief. He said despite his initial fears, the birth which took about half-an-hour, went well.

He said: 'I was a little bit scared 
but your instincts kick in, I didn't actually do a lot, Sarah did all 
the work I just cleaned him up when he came out made sure the cord was 
okay.

'Sarah did really well and I'm very proud of her for doing it without pain relief or anything like that.'
