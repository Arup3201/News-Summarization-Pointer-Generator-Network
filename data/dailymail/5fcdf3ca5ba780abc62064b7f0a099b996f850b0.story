Hospital death: Jack Adcock, six, had Down’s syndrome and other pre-existing health problems

A doctor and two nurses were yesterday charged with gross negligence manslaughter over the death of a six-year-old boy in hospital.

Jack Adcock, who had Down’s syndrome and other pre-existing health problems, died of pneumonia  almost five years ago after initially being admitted with sickness and diarrhoea.

Prosecutors said they had taken the decision to charge the three people over the death of Jack, from Glen Parva, Leicestershire, only after careful consideration of the evidence.

Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba, Sister Theresa Taylor and Staff Nurse Isabel Amaro are due to appear at Leicester Magistrates’ Court on January 23 over the allegations regarding the boy's death at at Leicester Royal Infirmary in February 2011.

Fiona Morrison, specialist prosecutor with the Crown Prosecution Service's special crime division, said the decision to charge was made in light of a review of the evidence gathered by Leicestershire Police into the clinicians’ ‘treatment and care’ of the youngster.

She added: ‘Having completed our review, we have concluded there is sufficient evidence and it is in the public interest for Dr Bawa-Garba, Sister Taylor and Staff Nurse Amaro to each face charges of gross negligence manslaughter.
