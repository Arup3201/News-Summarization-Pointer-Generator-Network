Visitors to Vegas are hit with the constant noise of coins cascading out of slot machines and everywhere they look are opulent hotels and their rich residents, but the desert town that is guaranteed to shock has a very dirty secret. Â 

According to a new economic study of the 100 largest U.S. cities, since the recession 'Sin City' has become the single most dreadful place to live in America.

Academics say although Vegas is undoubtedly the entertainment and gambling capital of the world nowhere has employment, business growth and house prices plunged further.

Las Vegas has been voted the worst city to live in in the United States following an economic study of the 100 biggest cities in the country

This map shows the cities ratings from the survey, with 20 worst being coloured red and the 20 best being coloured navy blue

Many homeowners in the city have been ruined by a crash in house prices, which were an astonishing 64.5 per cent lower in June 2011 compared to the market peak of late 2007.

And in the same period unemployment is up 7.5 per cent, employment down 13.4 per cent, and gross metropolitan product down 12.8 per cent.

Economists from MetroMoniter used these four criteria to rank the worst performing, and therefore the most miserable U.S. cities.

Riverside in California was rated the second worst city to live in by the survey, with house prices down more than 50 per cent

Sacramento came in third place in the survey, one of a number of California cities in the top 20 worst places to live

Aside from Las Vegas, every place in the top ten of the misery list is in California or Florida, proving that sunshine is not everything for its residents.

Riverside, Sacramento, and Stockton, all in California, follow Las Vegas as the most depressing places with Cape Coral in Florida in fifth place.

The rest of the top ten is made up of Sarasota, Palm Bay, and Miami, all in Florida, followed by Fresno, California in ninth and Tampa, Florida, in tenth.

'Our economy is stuck running in place and running out of breath,' said 
Howard Wial a Brookings fellow and co-author of the report.

'There has been very slow growth in jobs and economic output, and house prices and wages are at dramatic lows.'

The report, released today, shows that while there has been economic improvement in America, many cities are nowhere near recovery.

Overall, employment rates rebounded from their low point two years ago in almost all of the largest cities, but only 16 have got back more than half the jobs they have lost since 2007.

Stockton, California ranked fourth in the survey, one of four cities from the State in the top ten

Cape Coral was the only city from Florida in the top five. The city has seen employment drop 16.9 per cent, while the price of a home has dropped by nearly 60 per cent

House prices across America have hit new lows as in all the 100 metropolitan areas studied, house prices are still lower than at any time since the recession.

Meanwhile the unemployment rate in June 2011 remained above six per cent in almost all of the large metropolitan areas and although they are lower than a year ago, all of the cities had higher unemployment rates in June 2011 than in June 2008.

And since the beginning of the recession, wages fell in 51 of the 100 largest metropolitan areas and rose in 49, while more than half of the 100 cities had made a complete output recovery by the second quarter of 2011.
