David Cameron has claimed the fight against Islamist extremism was a 'generational' battle

A shocked David Cameron tonight hit out at the ‘absolutely disgusting, despicable’ murder of US hostage Steven Sotloff, after a video was posted online showing his apparent beheading.

It comes just two weeks after an almost identical video was posted online showing the killing of US journalist James Foley.

The Prime Minister was addressing Tory MPs in a private meeting in Parliament when gloating ISIS executioners released the footage.

At the end of the meeting of the Conservative backbench 1922 committee, Mr Cameron was seen looking at his blackberry before emerging to address journalists.

He said: ‘I’ve just seen the news. It is an absolutely disgusting, despicable act.’

The killer is believed to a British jihadist nicknamed ‘John’ by captives who was responsible for the first beheading.

In the video he says: ‘I am back, Obama, and I am back because of your arrogant foreign policy towards the Islamic State, because of your insistence on continuing your bombings and ... on Mosul Dam, despite our serious warnings.

‘Just as your missiles continue to strike our people, our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people.’

The extremist also warns other governments against entering ‘this evil alliance of America against the Islamic State’.

It comes just 24 hours after Mr Cameron outlined a fresh crack down on extremists returning from the Middle East to wage war on Britain.

He told MPs in a Commons statement that police will be given the power to seize the passports of terror suspects trying to join jihadists fighting in Iraq and Syria.

He also revealed the Government was considering new powers to force jihadis living in the UK to relocate, while airlines will be compelled to hand over passenger lists before flights take off.

New laws will be considered to prevent terrorists returning to 'wreak havoc' on the streets of Britain by removing their citizenship if they are fighting for ISIS abroad.

The Prime Minister also admitted the Government would 'continue to consider' what further action Britain could take against the ISIS fighters in the Middle East - including what 'military measures we might take'.

Mr Cameron was asked directly if he was 'open to the idea of direct military participation in airstrikes'.

He replied: 'I don't rule anything out. I don't think we should.' He added: 'We should consider everything.'

The Prime Minister only last week warned that ISIS was now a ‘greater threat to our security’ in Britain than ‘we have seen before’.

American journalist Steven Sotloff was murdered by an ISIS extremist, according to a video released online

Mr Cameron said the first murder was ‘clear evidence, not that any more was needed, that this is not some foreign conflict thousands of miles from home that we can hope to ignore’.

He said: ‘The ambition to create an extremist caliphate in the heart of Iraq and Syria is a threat to our own security here in the UK."

The first film showed Mr Foley, 40, who worked for organisations including Agence France-Presse and went missing in Syria in 2012, kneeling in a desert-like environment at an unknown location as an ISIS fighter stands by his side dressed in black and with his face covered.

Speaking with an apparently English accent, the killer accused America of ‘aggression towards the Islamic state’, adding: ‘You have plotted against us and gone far out of your way to find reasons to interfere in our affairs.

He said further actions in Iraq by America ‘will result in the bloodshed of your people’.

Mr Cameron told MPs yesterday that the Government needed to tighten rules monitoring extremists at home and abroad

Mr Cameron said ISIS was trying to carve out a ‘terrorist state’ which posed a greater threat to Britain than al-Qaeda or the Taliban.

He said: ‘The ambition to create an extremist caliphate in the heart of Iraq and Syria is a threat to our own security here in the UK.’

Mr Cameron added: ‘What we are facing in Iraq now with Isil (Islamic State) is a greater threat to our security than we have seen before.’
