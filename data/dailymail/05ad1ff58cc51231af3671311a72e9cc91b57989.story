A woman discovered a passive aggressive letter she wrote to the Tooth Fairy 23-years-ago when she was just nine-years-old.

After Jenny, who goes by the Reddit name Judokitten, posted the letter on Monday it got nearly 6,000 points and thousands of comments in response.

'My dad found my passive aggressive note that I wrote to the Tooth Fairy,' Jenny wrote with the snapshot of the letter she wrote back in 1991.

The author: Jenny, 32, discovered the letter at her family's home over the weekend and posted to Reddit on Monday not expecting to get the overwhelming response she did 

'It was better than I remember.'

Jenny told Yahoo Parenting that she recalls writing the letter at a time when she was starting to, 'figure out the truth' about things like the Tooth Fairy and Santa

She said that after losing a tooth she'd wait for two days to tell anyone to see if the Tooth Fairy would actually come.

'So when I lost this tooth, I didn’t tell anyone for two days because I wanted to see if she would come,' said Jenny.

Jenny told her mother about her anger towards the Tooth Fairy and her mother suggested she write a letter to the Tooth Fairy telling her how she felt.

'(Not very) Dear T. F. — This is the second time you’ve done this. You forgot me. So if you’re not going to come, then I’m going to keep my own teeth. You are through collecting teeth. From Jennifer.

From now on I’m keeping my own teeth. Unsincerely, Jennifer E. PS Keep collecting from Mike, though. Obviously you like him better. P.P.S. Don’t bother to write back,' said the letter.

The next day, the Tooth Fairy (Jenny's mother) wrote Jenny a letter back.

Letter to the Tooth Fairy: 'My dad found my passive aggressive note that I wrote to the Tooth Fairy,' Jenny wrote with the snapshot of the letter she wrote back in 1991

'I couldn’t get to your pillow the night before last because I got stuck in all the mess. Maybe if you clean your room, I could get to you in a timely manner,' said the note in response which arrived the next day.

Jenny thought of the letter when she went to visit her parents over the weekend.

After Jenny brought up the letter to her father he was able to pull it out from a notebook minutes later.

'My mom keeps all of my adorable things —like my kindergarten graduation cape — and my dad keeps all the snarky things, so it made sense that he would have it,' said Jenny.

Jenny said that her mother's response to her Tooth Fairy letter let her in on the secret that the tooth fairy wans’t real.

'Her response was a quiet acknowledgement between us that my mom and I both knew the truth,' Jenny said.

'Mike, my brother – well, I won’t reveal how long he believed. But let’s just say for his last tooth, the Tooth Fairy gave him gas money.'

Jenny who has a seven-year-old son and nine-year-old daughter hasn’t had to deal with her children doubting the Tooth Fairy's existence yet but she has been late on a few tooth payments.

'I’ve forgotten to leave money before and had to come up with excuses for why the Tooth Fairy was late, though none were as good as my mom’s,' she told Yahoo.

'Recently I used, "you lost the tooth really late in the afternoon so the fairy already got her list for the day. She’ll catch up with you tomorrow." I think it worked!'
