The parents of American aid worker Peter Kassig have taken to TV to reveal the heartbreak of their son's ISIS captors' 'unreasonable demands', which they are 'powerless' to fulfill. 

Ed and Paula Kassig, from Indianapolis, will make an emotional appearance on CBS tomorrow, 10 days after the 26-year-old war veteran was threatened with death in a video filmed by the group.

In a preview of the footage, they say they hope their son will learn of their TV appearance - either directly or indirectly - and 'know we are doing everything we can to secure his release'.

They also speak of the 'demanding' nature of Peter's captors, who threatened him in a chilling video showing the beheading of 47-year-old British aid worker Alan Henning on October 3.

Plea: Ed and Paula Kassig, from Indianapolis, have taken to TV (pictured) to issue a heartfelt plea to ISIS to show compassion and free their 26-year-old son Peter, who was threatened with death by the terror group

Sitting in their living room with a school photo of Peter - also known by the Islamic name Abdul-Rahman in the background - the Kassigs said ISIS militants have not 'asked'' for anything.

Instead, 'they demand, they simply demand,' Mr Kassig told correspondent Margaret Brennan on CBS This Morning.

Donning a purple jacket and turtleneck top, Mrs Kassig added: 'And their demands have always been ones we cannot accommodate.'

Ms Brennan then asked the couple if the demands were 'beyond what is reasonable in terms of money, in terms of power?', to which Mrs Kassig replied: 'In both cases, yes.'

Looking down with teary eyes, she continued: 'And we have sent them back messages that we cannot do what you ask. We have tried, but we don't have the power.'

An inspiration: While in Turkey, Peter (pictured) founded SERA (Special Emergency Response and Assistance), an emergency relief group that serves refugee populations and internally displaced persons

While in Turkey, he founded SERA (Special Emergency Response and Assistance), a medically-oriented emergency relief group that serves refugee populations and internally displaced persons.

It was while working on a project for SERA almost exactly a year ago, on October 1, 2013, that Peter was captured by members of ISIS as he headed to Deir Ezzor in eastern Syria.

In the brutal video showing Mr Henning's death earlier this month, Peter was shown kneeling in the desert while a masked militant condemned President Barack Obama for 'aerial bombardments'.

The militant added: 'It's only right we continue to strike the necks of your people.' 

Emotional plea: Mr and Mrs Kassig's latest plea  comes just days after they released an emotional YouTube video (pictured), in which they begged their son's ISIS captors to 'show mercy' and free him

Desperate: On Wednesday, the couple appealed directly to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi on Twitter, begging him to spare their only son's life. Above, Mrs Kassig's tweet, featuring a letter to al Baghdadi

Mr and Mrs Kassig's latest plea to Peter's captors comes just a few days after they appealed directly to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi on Twitter, begging him to spare their only son's life.

Mrs Kassig posted a letter on the social networking site, reading: 'I am trying to get in touch with the Islamic State about my son's fate. I am an old woman, and Abdul-Rahman is my only child.

'My husband and I are on our own, with no help from the government. We would like to talk to you. How can we reach you?'

The tweet followed an emotional YouTube video, released by the couple on October 4, in which they pleaded to Peter's captors to 'show mercy and use their power to let him go'.

Humanitarian work: It was while working on a project for SERA almost exactly a year ago, on October 1, 2013, that Peter (pictured) was captured by members of ISIS as he headed to Deir Ezzor in eastern Syria

Mr Kassig, a school teacher, who was filmed on a sofa alongside his wife, told militants: 'Our family deplores all human suffering and the loss of innocent life, no matter who is responsible.

'We know that the Syrians have suffered. We also believe violence is not the solution to the problems that trouble us all.' 

Speaking directly to her son, Mrs Kassig, who was donning a headscarf and clasping a photo of the aid worker in her hands, added: 'We are so very proud of you and the work you have done to bring humanitarian aid to the Syrian people.

'Our hearts ache for you to be granted your freedom so we can hug you again and then set you free to continue the life you have chosen, the life of service to those in greatest need.'

Beheading: On October 3, Mr Kassig was threatened with death in a video showing the beheading of 47-year-old British aid worker Alan Henning (pictured). He was seen kneeling in the sand at the end of the footage

Ed Kassig: 'We're hoping that, if not directly, word will get to him indirectly that we're doing everything we can to secure his release.'

Margaret Brennan (CNN): 'Have his captors asked for anything?'

Mr Kassig: 'No, they demand. They simply demand.'

Paula Kassig: 'And their demands have always been ones we cannot accommodate.'

Brennan: 'It's just beyond what's reasonable in terms of money, in terms of your power?'

Mrs Kassig: 'Right, in both cases, yes. And we have sent them back messages that we cannot do what you ask. We have tried, but we don't have the power.'

The  beheading of Mr Henning  followed the murders of three other captives in similar circumstances: U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and British aid worker David Haines.

U.S. officials have confirmed that Mr Kassig is being held by Islamic State militants, but have declined to give any more details of his capture.

The aid worker's family said in a statement earlier this month that they had stayed silent about this news 'at the wish of those who have held their son.'

They also revealed that their son had converted to Islam while being held hostage. Former hostages told the family that Kassig's new faith has given him comfort during his long captivity.

In a letter to his parents, which they received on June 2, Peter revealed that he was 'scared to die' and saddened by the pain the ordeal has caused his family, BBC News reported.

The hostage wrote: 'I am obviously pretty scared to die but the hardest part is not knowing, wondering, hoping, and wondering if I should even hope at all.'

He continued: 'If I do die, I figure that at least you and I can seek refuge and comfort in knowing that I went out as a result of trying to alleviate suffering and helping those in need.'

He also told his parents that he prayed every day and was not angry about his situation 'in terms of my faith'. The letter ended with the words: 'I love you.'

President Barack Obama has strongly condemned the death of Mr Henning and urged that U.S. forces and its allies will bring his killers to justice.

'Mr Henning worked to help improve the lives of the Syrian people and his death is a great loss for them, for his family and the people of the United Kingdom,' the politican said in a statement.

'Standing together with our U.K. friends and allies, we will work to bring the perpetrators of Alan's murder - as well as the murders of Jim Foley, Steven Sotloff and David Haines - to justice.' 

The President added that the U.S. and other nations will continue to take action to 'degrade and ultimately destroy' the Islamic State group.
