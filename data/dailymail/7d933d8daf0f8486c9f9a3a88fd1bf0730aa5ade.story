Breast implants in France will come with a health warning after experts discovered a link with a rare form of cancer.

France's National Cancer Institute said there was a 'clearly established link' between a specific type of implant and the disease.

Experts said they have identified 18 cases of anaplastic large cell lymphoma since 2011, linked to silicone breast implants.

Given the rarity of cases, the Institute said there is no need to recommend the removal of the implants.

Breast implants in France will come with a health warning after 18 women were found to have a rare form of cancer after having an augmentation operation 

'This complication presents very infrequently,' the body said.

France's health minister immediately sought to calm fears haunted by a similar scare in 2011.

French firm PIP sparked a global health scare in 2011, when plastic surgeons began reporting an unusual number of ruptures in their products. 

The PIP implants were banned and the company eventually liquidated. 

'We do not recommend that women carrying these implants have them removed,' Health Minister Marisol Touraine said.

Anaplastic large cell lymphoma is a rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma - a blood cancer.

It is a cancer of the lymphatic system, which forms part of the body's immune system.

The rare disease is more common in children and young adults.

It develops when abnormal white blood cells divide in an uncontrolled way.

The cancerous white blood cells then travel to parts of the body, commonly the lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow and blood and form a tumour. 

Symptoms of the disease include:

The disease makes up around three per cent of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas in adults and 10 to 30 per cent in children.

It grows quickly and usually needs immediate treatment with chemotherapy. Some patients may also need radiotherapy or stem cell transplants.

She urged women not to get 'carried away by excessive worry', about the implants.

'Our vigilance is absolute,' she said. 

Ms Touraine said no particular brand of implant was in question.

However the Parisien Daily reported that 14 of the 18 cases of the rare cancer were found in women with breast implants made by US pharmaceutical company Allergan.

Allergan said in a statement: 'The security of patients is our first priority.'

It added the company is collaborating closely with the health authorities and the drug agency ANSM.

The company added that all women aged 25 or over should have an annual health check. 

The head of the National Cancer Institute, Agnes Buzyn, said the increased detection rate could also be attributed to better screening.

According to Francois Hebert, deputy head of the ANSM drugs agency, around 400,000 women in France have had breast implants.

Of those 80 per cent had the procedure for cosmetic reasons, while 20 per cent had the operation following breast cancer. 

Almost 50,000 women in the UK and some 400,000 worldwide, were affected by the PIP scare came to light.

There was uproar when it emerged the French firm Poly Implant Prothese (PIP) had been manufacturing implants using industrial grade silicone intended for use in mattresses. 

However a report into PIP scandal, published last May, found 'no convincing' medical data which suggests women with PIP implants should have them removed.

European health officials found no medical or toxicological evidence to justify removal. 

The European Commission's Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks found no reliable evidence that ruptured PIP implants posed a health risk.

They concluded a ruptured PIP implant posed not greater threat than a ruptured implant from another manufacturer.

Their findings backed a 2012 review by NHS medical director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, which concluded the implants were not toxic or carcinogenic.

However Jean-Claude Mas, the founder of the company, was jailed for four years in 2013 for fraad, at a court in France.
