A judge on Thursday dismissed rape charges against former Detroit Tigers pitcher Evan Reed, saying the testimony of the woman who accused him wasn't credible and prosecutors failed to show that force or coercion took place.

Reed, 28, was accused of raping the 45-year-old woman in a hotel room at the Motor City Casino in Detroit on March 6 while she was incapacitated.

'Her lies caught up with her,' Reed said after the hearing. He has said they had consensual sex.

Reed said he was 'elated' to be cleared of the third-degree criminal sexual conduct charges. He was with the Tigers at the time of the incident and appeared in 27 games for Detroit before being sent to his current assignment with the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens.

The 45-year-old woman testified at Thursday's probable cause hearing that she met Reed at a bar in the suburb of Royal Oak on March 30 and that they later went to a casino in downtown Detroit. She said she 'blacked out' after taking a drink that tasted 'sour' and that she believes had been drugged.

The Detroit Free Press reports that surveillance video from that night show the woman falling off a sidewalk onto her back without attempting to brace herself at all.

Reed is then seen carrying the woman into the hotel building.

However, Judge Kenneth King said there was no evidence the woman was raped inside the hotel. 

The judge said that the woman appeared to be unimpaired when she walked down a set of stairs, despite claiming she didn't have the presence of mind to take the elevator.

'She wasn’t wobbling, she wasn't falling, she wasn't stumbling,' King said, reports the Free Press. 'And she was wearing high heels.' 

He did concede that she was definitely incapacitated when she and Reed arrived at the hotel room in which she alleges the sexual assault occurred. 

'The problem is what happened in that hotel room … no one knows,' Judge King said.

The woman testified today that she was on her third vodka tonic when she noticed the drink tasted particularly sour.

Her next memory is waking up naked in bed with Reed.

The woman described what happened in graphic detail after she awoke the following morning during her hour-and-a-half testimony.

'Everything was spinning, my head was hurting,' she said. 'I remember getting up and kind of holding on to the wall and going into the bathroom.'

She noticed a foul smell and a stain on the sheets; she said she got into the shower where Reed tried to have anal sex with her.

She told him no and went back to the bed. 'My mind was telling me all I wanted to do was go back and sleep,' she said, reports CBS.

 Reed then tried to initiate oral sex with her the woman said, and she refused.

After that, she said Reed told her she needed to leave because he had things to do. 

A police officer who examined the room as part of the investigation testified there was feces on the bed and on towels, but no evidence was taken. 

Judge Kenneth King threw out the charges, though, saying the woman gave contradictory accounts of what happened, including testifying that she had no idea that Reed and his companions at the bar played for the Tigers, then acknowledging that she texted a friend that evening to say she was with members of the team.

'Because of the alleged victim's vacillating testimony and her inability to remember many parts of the evening, I don't think (prosecutors) have met their burden of probable cause,' he said.

Assistant prosecutor Suzette Samuels said afterward that the ruling was 'disappointing,' and that she believes 'it was another value judgment' against a sexual assault victim. She did not say whether her office plans to appeal.
