A piece of graffiti featuring the names of three young sisters who may have fallen victim to the 1515 plague has been discovered on the wall of a medieval church.

The names of Cateryn, Jane and Amee Maddyngley were found scrawled near the front door of All Saint's and St Andrew's Church in Kingston, near Cambridge, by amateur archaeologists.

The writing, which features their names and date, shows they left their mark on the village church in 1515 – as the country was hit by an outbreak of the bubonic plague.

The markings of Cateryn, Jane and Amee Maddyngley (pictured with the markings coloured in) stretch back to 1515 and have been discovered for the first time by Norfolk and Suffolk Medieval Graffiti Survey volunteers

It was found hidden under lime wash which was removed by Norfolk and Suffolk Medieval Graffiti Survey volunteers.

Archaeologist Matt Champion said the three girls were almost certainly children because their names have not been listed as adults in any parish records.

Other records reveal that members of their family were tenant farmers who had lived in Kingston since at least 1279.

Centuries ago it was common for individuals to scrawl their names in churches as they were unable to afford memorials.

Mr Champion, who is working with a team which studies medieval graffiti, said their project had shown that church plague graffiti was far more common than previously thought.

He said the elite and wealthy were remembered with monuments while graffiti remembered the 'common voice'.

He said: 'The most heart-breaking inscriptions are those that refer to long-dead children.

'This one is particularly emotive because it's the names of three girls who all died in the same year.

'These people often couldn't afford to have themselves memorialised and in some cases this graffiti could have been the last mark of their life and that is heart-breaking.'

Although no records show how the girls died, it is believed they fell victim to the Black Death.

One of the inscriptions discovered by Norfolk and Suffolk Medieval Graffiti Survey volunteers at the Cambridge church was a prayer, asking for God to have mercy upon the soul of an individual called 'Watton'

Another inscription was that of a ritual protection marks – also known as witch marks - which wards off evil

During their time spent uncovering the works in the church, the team also found a number of other inscriptions including ritual protection marks – also known as witch marks - which are said to ward of evil spirits.

Other inscriptions show figures of armed men and prayers to those who had fallen ill from the plague.

The plea 'God save us' was also found scrawled across the church in Steeple Bumstead, Cambridgeshire, and is believed to be dated back to 1348.

The Reverend Dr Alexandra Clarke, of All Saint's and St Andrew's Church, said the discovery of the graffiti was pleasing.

She said: 'None of us knew about the graffiti so it has added something to our local knowledge and it's very exciting.

'The church is full of absolutely fascinating historical details. It has stunning 14th Century wall painting and there is a lot of graffiti chiselled in the tower - which was used by a school for years.'

Churchwarden Peter Reynolds added that the new discovery was 'a bit mysterious' for the church, which is open every day to visitors.

He said: 'This is a new discovery. The group that came are experts who used cameras and equipment to find the graffiti. A lot of it isn't visible to the naked eye.'

The project to unearth medieval graffiti was set up in 2010 and is the first attempt to survey pre-Reformation graffiti in churches since the late 1960s. Pictured: An example of graffiti from Ashwell church, Hertfordshire

The 1515 outbreak of the bubonic plague started in London and quickly spread across south east England.

At the time, Cambridge University suspended its classes and large gatherings of people were banned from attending public events.

Children were particularly hard-hit and their bodies were usually hastily buried in unmarked graves.

The graffiti project was set up in 2010 and is the first attempt to survey pre-Reformation graffiti in churches since the late 1960s.

Volunteers use digital cameras and powerful lamps to reveal previously hidden or faded markings.

At least 60 per cent of the 650 churches surveyed in Norfolk, Suffolk and north Essex have been found to contain 'significant amounts' of graffiti and volunteers have recorded up to 500 pieces in many of them.

The project has confirmed that most of the medieval graffiti was created during times of pestilence such as the Black Death of 1349 and subsequent outbreaks of plagues.

The bubonic plague is one of the most devastating diseases in history, having killed millions of people during the 'Black Death' in the 14th Century.

It resulted in the deaths of an estimated 75 to 200 million people  in Europe between 1346 and 1353 and claimed thousands of other victims during the dozens of additional outbreaks  later down the line.

Drawings and paintings from the Black Death, which wiped out about a third of the European population, depict town criers shouting 'bring out your dead' while dragging trailers piled with infected corpses through the streets.

The plague is caused by a bacterium known as Yersinia pestis, which uses the flea as a host and is usually transmitted to humans via rats.

It causes grotesque symptoms such as gangrene and the appearance of large swellings on the groin, armpits or neck, known as 'buboes'.

The bubonic plague kills up to two thirds of sufferers within just four days if it is not treated. 

However, if antibiotics are administered within 24 hours of infection, patients are highly likely to survive.

After the Black Death arrived in 1347, the plague became a common phenomenon in Europe, with outbreaks recurring regularly until the 18th Century.

Bubonic plague has now almost completely vanished from the western world, with 90 per cent of all cases now found in Africa.

However, there have been a few non-fatal cases in the U.S. in recent years, while in August 2013 a 15-year-old boy died in Kyrgyzstan after eating a groundhog infected with the disease.

Three months later, an outbreak in a Madagascan killed at least 20 people in a week. A year before 60 people died as a result of the infection, more than in any other country in the world.

Outbreaks in China have been rare in recent years, and most have happened in remote rural areas of the west.

China's state broadcaster said there were 12 diagnosed cases and three deaths in the province of Qinghai in 2009, and one in Sichuan in 2012.

In the U.S. between five and 15 people die every year as a result, mostly in western states.
