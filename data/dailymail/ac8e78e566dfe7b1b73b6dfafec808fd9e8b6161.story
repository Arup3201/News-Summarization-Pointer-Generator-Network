Departing Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard says he is looking forward to the challenge ahead of playing for LA Galaxy as he bids to add to his silverware collection.

The 34-year-old's July move to the MLS side was confirmed by their coach Bruce Arena on Wednesday in an interview with the LA Times.

And Gerrard, who  has agreed an 18-month contract - worth £3.9million a year, has described the transfer as a 'match made in heaven'.

Steven Gerrard won't be the first Premier League star to join LA Galaxy.

David Beckham, Landon Donovan, Juan Pablo Angel and Abel Xavier featured both in England and America for LA Galaxy.

'I think it's a match made in heaven really,' he told the newspaper.

'One of the reasons I chose LA Galaxy was because of the success they've had recently.

'I want to finish my career very strong. I want to add some medals and trophies to my collection.'

The former England captain will be joining the Western Conference side who have won three of the last four MLS Cups - including the 2014 edition.

He will follow in the footsteps of former Three Lions team-mate Frank Lampard in heading across the Atlantic but unlike the on-loan Manchester City star he will start his MLS career on schedule.

LA coach Arena believes the club's successful history made it an attractive proposition for Gerrard.

'Steven Gerrard arrives in July and by then we will certainly have a plan available,' Arena said. 'He's a player of quality. I'm not concerned about how he's going to fit in with our team.

'We have a club now with a proven history of success. All those things go hand in hand in making LA Galaxy a very attractive team for players such as Steven Gerrard.'

Galaxy president Chris Klein described the Reds captain as 'the perfect fit'.

'We just started thinking in the universe of players that are out there, we want to make a decision on what signifies a Galaxy-designated player.

'When we look at that, Steven Gerrard is the perfect fit with what he brings to us on the field and the character that he has off it.'

The Reds skipper, who was out in Liverpool city centre at Secret nightclub on Tuesday night to celebrate Martin Skrtel's 30th birthday, admitted had his boyhood club offered him a new contract last summer he would not be leaving at the end of the season.

However, the midfielder insists he does not want to blame anyone for his impending departure.

A contract offer was not made to Gerrard, who turns 35 in May, until November - by which time he had already been told by Brendan Rodgers his playing time would be managed.

Such a tactic had already seen him left on the bench for Liverpool's Champions League match against Real Madrid in the Bernabeu and that, combined with the delay in offering him an extension, resulted in the player coming to a decision about his future.

'If a contract had been put in front of me in pre-season I would have signed it,' he told the Liverpool Echo.

'I'd just retired from England to concentrate all my efforts on Liverpool. I didn't want my club games to be tailored.

'My injury record had been fantastic for the past two and a half years and I had a great season from a personal point of view last season.

'It's all ifs, buts and hindsight now. That period between the summer and the end of November gave me thinking time.

'There's no blame and I'm not angry about it. There are other people in the squad and the club had other things to worry about.

'There is no finger pointing from me towards the manager or anyone else at the club.'

Gerrard proved his enduring worth to the Reds by scoring both goals in their 2-1 FA Cup third-round win at League Two side AFC Wimbledon on Monday night.

The draw for the fourth round sees Rodgers' team at home against Bolton.
