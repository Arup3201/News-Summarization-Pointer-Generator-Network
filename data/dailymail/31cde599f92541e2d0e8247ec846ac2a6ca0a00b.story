Anthony Lloyd, 17, was found by police with his pockets 'bulging' with stolen cigarettes and jewellery

A teenage looter who took part in the Manchester riots lied in court about being an Olympic hopeful in a bid to avoid jail. 

Anthony Lloyd, 17, who was caught with pockets bulging with jewellery and cigarettes during the riots in Manchester on August 9, was jailed for eight months yesterday.

But now he could now be hauled back into the dock after falsely claiming he was a member of the British judo team in a desperate plea for leniency. 

A letter was even presented to the judge at Manchester Magistrates Court backing up the claim. 

Lloyd had managed to convince his unwitting legal team he was a promising judo star. 

His defence lawyer Estelle Parkhouse told the court: 'A custodial sentence would impair his prospects with the squad and being part of the Olympics.' 

But it has been discovered Lloyd has never performed for Great Britain at any level. 

Bosses at the British Judo Association said that while he is a member of a local club he is 'a million miles away' from being anywhere near the national squad. 

A spokesman said: 'Mr Lloyd has never represented us at any level and it's wrong for anyone to describe him as an Olympic hopeful.

'He represents a club but has never been in any GB trials or anywhere near any of our squads.'

It is understood the case could now be re-opened if the court feels it has been misled.  Lloyd may now face further charges of perjury should judges decide to bring him back into the dock.

Loyd was sentenced to eight months' detention and training for each count, to serve concurrently at Manchester Youth Court

He could also be hauled before Crown Court if the offence is considered serious enough. 

Lloyd, of Audenshaw, was stopped by police at 9.30pm at the height of the rioting in Manchester. 

Officers found him carrying £66 worth of cigarettes stolen from a looted newsagents and a collection of costume jewellery which he said he had picked up off the floor.

During the case Lloyd's lawyer Estelle Parkhouse said Lloyd was part of the British Judo team 
and was returning from training that Tuesday night when he heard about 
the disorder and ventured into the city centre.

She said he took jewellery that he had seen on the street and knew it had been stolen. She said it was his intention to give it to his girlfriend.

Lloyd's parents and brother were in court to hear District Judge Jonathan Taaffe describe the case as 'most tragic'.

The judge said he accepted Lloyd had led a 'blameless existence' and had 'an excellent future and was a talented sportsman'. 

But after reading glowing references the judge told him: 'It is my duty to impose a custodial sentence in this matter. 

'The public have to be aware that people who choose to become involved in large scale public disorder, rioting and looting, will be severely punished. 

'On this night the centre of Manchester and Salford resembled a battlefield and the public throughout the country were shocked and sickened by what they saw.'

Lloyd, who burst into tears as the sentence was read out, said he had been stupid and had gone into the city out of curiosity.

After the hearing Ms Parkhouse issued a statement on his behalf, saying: 'I am sincerely remorseful for my actions and would do anything to give back to the community what I have taken from them.'

It is understood attempts to check the bogus claim were made by the defence team. But they were unable to contact the GB team as they were in action abroad.

Lloyd's social worker father declined to comment.
