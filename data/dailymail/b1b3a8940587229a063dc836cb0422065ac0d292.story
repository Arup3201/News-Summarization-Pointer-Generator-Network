A Texas judge has ruled that a man who doused a boy with gasoline and lit him on fire when he was a teenager can now be tried as an adult for murder even though the incident took place 13 years before the victim died.

Authorities allege that Don Willburn Collins was 13 when he attacked Robert Middleton in 1998 on his eighth birthday near the younger boy's home in Splendora, about 35 miles northeast of Houston.

Middleton was burned across 99 per cent of his body and endured years of physical therapy before he died in 2011 from skin cancer blamed on his burns.

Brought to court: Don Wilburn Collins, seen here Wednesday, can now face murder charges more than a decade after attacking a former neighbor with acid. The boy survived but died from complications from the burns years later

Back in court: Collins was sent to juvenile detention for a few months immediately after the attack but never had a full trial or faced criminal charges, but that will likely change with the new ruling

Middleton had initially named Collins as his attacker and the older boy was arrested in 1998.

Collins spent several months in juvenile detention but was released after prosecutors said they did not have enough evidence to pursue the case.

Shortly before he died, Middleton gave a videotaped deposition in which he accused Collins for the first time of sexually assaulting him two weeks before the attack.

The sexual assault allegation prompted investigators to reopen the case, and prosecutors charged the now 28-year-old Collins with murder last year â€” but they needed to move the case from juvenile to adult court to take him to trial.

Before and after: Robert Middleton, seen left before the attack, faced constant health problems for the remainder of this life, seen right in an undated photo of him years later

Heartbreaking: He was left with 99 per cent of his skin covered in burns, and eventually died due to skin cancer in 2011

After a three-day hearing on that 
issue this week, state District Judge Kathleen Hamilton ruled that 
Colllins' case could be transferred.

The ruling enables the prosecutors' murder case against Collins.

Colleen Middleton, Robert's mother, said she was relieved the case would go to trial.

'When Robert died we were thinking maybe nothing will ever happen, maybe someone is just going to get away with what they did to him,' she said. 'It's been a long road.'

Turning back time: Collins' lawyer said that it is against his constitutional rights to be tried as an adult for something he did when he was a child because so much time has passed in between the attack and now

Keeping the focus on her son: Mrs Middleton, seen in the Texas court room on Wednesday, has continued the fight since her son died of skin cancer in 2011

Several witnesses testified during 
this week's hearing that Collins had confessed to them or others that he
 had been responsible for the attack on Middleton. Part of Middleton's 
taped deposition also was shown during the hearing.

In a separate case, Collins was convicted of sexually assaulting another 8-year-old boy.

Now an adult, the victim testified during this week's hearing that Collins had threatened to burn him if he told anybody what happened.

Collins' attorney, E. Tay Bond, had argued that moving the case to adult court would violate his client's constitutional rights. Bond also questioned the reliability of Middleton's statements, as well as secondhand statements made by other witnesses, saying there was 'no new credible evidence in this case.'

Seeking justice: Colleen Middleton came face to face with her son's attacker in October- the first time in 15 years

Bond argued that the case should not be transferred to adult court because under state law in 1998, a juvenile had to be at least 14 years old for a capital felony offense case to be transferred to adult court. The law was changed in 1999 to lower the age to 10.

Prosecutors said the crime of murder did not take place until 2011, well after the law was changed. But Bond said the law couldn't be applied retroactively to Collins.

Collins, who is being held on a $1 million bond, will remain jailed as he faces up to 10 years in prison for a charge in neighboring San Jacinto County of failing to register as a sex offender.
