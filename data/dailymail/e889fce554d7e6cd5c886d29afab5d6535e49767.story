From the quirky opening ceremony to the fish and chips at the venues, the Olympics so far has been a distinctly British affair.

So perhaps it was inevitable that sooner or later, spectators and competitors would get a taste of distinctly British weather.

Sports fans were forced to reach for umbrellas and waterproofs as the heavens opened yesterday, bringing thunder, lightning, wind and rain.

At Horse Guards Parade, near 
Whitehall, bikini-clad female beach volleyball players braved the chilly
drizzle. Play at Wimbledon was stalled for nearly three hours before 
the roof was deployed over Centre Court, and heavy rain in Greenwich 
caused a ten-minute delay to the dressage.

Afterwards, New Zealand eventer Andrew
Nicholson described the decision to wait for the rain to ease as 'an 
absolute disgrace', adding: 'I thought the British were meant to be 
sporting people.'

Great Britain's Kristina Cook remained philosophical after competing during a downpour just before the delay while team-mate Zara Phillips managed to enjoy the best of the weather in the morning, watched by her mother the Princess Royal and the Duke of Edinburgh in dry and bright conditions.

Swede Niklas Lindback had gone in to the arena but was told to wait amid thundery showers.

'To me, the weather wasn't bad enough to warrant that, it's just a bit of rain isn't it? I'm very frustrated with the organisers, I'd expect more from them at an Olympic Games.'

The venue also saw problems with the roof on the judges' building coming loose in the wind.

Cook said: 'I'm used to riding him in the rain at home, I don't have an indoor school.

'I've ridden in some very wet days on the South Downs. The horse is used to that to be honest, that side of it he was great.

'But when the judges' roof came up and down as he was doing his extended trot I really hoped that he wasn't going to spook.

'I'm just really pleased and proud of the horse that he just really kept a lid on it and kept focused and tried his best.

'Obviously I would love the sun shining down on me now, it would have been brilliant, but that's England for you isn't it?'

Open-air events were also affected by the weather, including tennis, archery and beach volleyball, as well as the women's cycling road race.

Forecasters also said they could not rule out showers in Weymouth, where thousands have gathered to watch the sailing.

There was a downpour at Lord's where the archery was taking place, seconds into the first women's team quarter-final between South Korea and Denmark.

The noise of the crowd opening their umbrellas came just as Denmark were about to begin, and seemed to trigger a poor second shot.

Meanwhile, the deluge at the Olympic Park saw super-size queues at the world's biggest McDonald's as crowds flocked to it to shelter from the rain.

The restaurant, which has a capacity of 1,500, was packed as fans queued up to get inside.

At one point there were rumours that the outlet had closed because demand was too high, but a McDonald's spokeswoman said that was not the case.

She said all four restaurants at the Olympic Park - of which two serve the public - were proving highly popular, but the largest had not been forced to close.

Long queues snaked from the two-storey building, which is close to the Olympic Stadium, but stewards said people were not having to wait too long to get in.

The flagship restaurant is designed to be reusable and recyclable after the Games - 75 per cent of it will be reused and almost everything else will be recycled, with furniture and equipment going to other UK restaurants.

Food served includes favourites like the Big Mac, Chicken McNuggets and fries, as well as porridge, McMuffins and bagels at breakfast, deli wraps and salads, and Happy Meals available for the first time at any Games.

The flagship restaurant is staffed with 500 employees from its 2,000 McDonald's Olympic Champion Crew - top-performing employees selected through a nationwide competition to work at the Games at one of the four McDonald's restaurants on the Olympic Park.

Heavy showers are forecast to soak 
Britain for the rest of the week, sparking fears some Olympic events 
could be delayed by rain.

Met Office forecaster Barry Gromett said: 'In a word the weather is changeable.

'Rain
is going to be the main feature of the weather for the week. There will
be a lot of wind on the western side with fairly frequent showers for 
the rest of the week.

'In London there will be showers every day, but also some quite warm weather so it will feel very humid.'

He
said the Olympic sailing centre in Weymouth is set for some of the 
worst of the bad weather, with heavy rain and wind set to batter the 
area overnight on Monday.

The Olympic Park in east London is set to fair better, with the mercury set to hover between 20C and 25C during the week.

Mr Gromett said on Monday, showers will pepper the day but the sun will break through with temperatures expected to reach 21C.

Heavy
rain will deluge London and other southern counties overnight, giving a
wet start to Tuesday morning, although sunshine is forecast for later 
in the day.

And unsettled weather is forecast for the rest of the week, with frequent showers breaking up sunny spells.

The north and west of England will endure the wettest weather.

Mr
Gromett said: 'We might see rain hit the sailing centre in Weymouth, 
but the sunshine should dry up the rain in London pretty quickly.'

The
Met Office said a band of low pressure from the Atlantic, circulating 
over Ireland and the west of England, was responsible for the return of 
the rain.
