Â It already knows who our friends are, what we listen to and what we look like.

Now Facebook can lay bare the secrets of our love lives.

Researchers at the social network have been trawling user data to analyse changes from non-coupled relationship statuses, such as 'single' or 'divorced', to coupled statuses, such as 'in a relationship' or 'engaged'.

By totting up and comparing the number of users posting the opposite change, letting friends know they're newly single, Facebook staff were able to figure out the boom and bust seasons for romance.

June came out as worst month for love, with the highest ratio of breakups to new relationships for all three age groups of under 25, 25-44 and 45 and over.

Summer in general proved to be a time for broken hearts: the months from May to August showed a higher than average proportion of newly single Facebook users.

With such a vast and rich source of data at their disposal, the website's analysts were even able to pinpoint specific days for surges and slumps in breakups and newfound love.

The statistics, gathered from U.S. users in 2010 and 2011, show Valentine's Day and Christmas are peak times for new relationships, with relatively few breaking up.

Predictably, February 14 lives up to its reputation, with 49 per cent more new relationships than splits.

And on Christmas Day, 34 per cent 
more users let the world know they had found someone special than those 
who broke news of a breakup.

Neither
of these peaks is isolated to a single day, with Christmas Eve and 
February 15 marking the third and fourth biggest increases in 
relationships.

The data, of course, comes with the concession that not everyone on Facebook is completely honest about their relationships.

Though
many users are incredibly open about their personal lives, and indeed 
some live to regret it, nobody is obliged to tell the truth on their 
profile.

Some long-standing couples may never 
think it necessary to broadcast their relationship status, while other 
users see it as a chance for a joke or a prank.

It's Friday, I'm not in love: The balance of relationship status changes shifts towards breakups as the week wears on. Negative percentages mean more users are becoming single

April Fool's Day is the fifth biggest day for new relationships, registering 20 per cent more new romances than splits.

But the fact that the very next day this swings to 11 per cent in the opposite direction means many of the pairings probably were not what they seemed.

In terms of days of the week, there was a net gain in relationships after the weekend - Sunday, Monday and Tuesday showed the biggest gains for Cupid.

The proportion of breakups increased in the run-up to the weekend, although for users aged under 25 the balance shifted back towards new romance by Saturday.

The research was carried out by data scientists Jackson Gorham and Andrew T Fiore.

On the trends seen over the course of the week, their report suggests: 'One explanation could be that people looking for a change tend to end their old relationships in time to spend the weekend with friends or get back in the game with someone new.

'Or maybe, as the song goes, breaking up is hard to do, and having a difficult conversation has to wait until the work week winds down.

'As for the net gain in relationships at the start of a new week? That may be a visible echo of the weekend's festivities - and the new social ties that result.'
