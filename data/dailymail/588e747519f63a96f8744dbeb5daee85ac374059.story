Support for animal experiments is at its lowest for more than a decade.

Government-commissioned surveys show that just 64 per cent of Britons agree with animals being used in medical research – a fall of 12 points since 2010 and the lowest figure since 2002.

Almost a quarter want a total ban on animal experiments.

Anger: A quarter of Britons now want to ban animal testing - the highest number since 2002

Dr Maggy Jennings, the RSPCA’s chief scientific officer, said: ‘These figures reveal the public’s deep-seated and persistent concerns for animals who suffer in the name of science.’

George Freeman, the minister for life sciences, said: ‘Animal research is currently essential to help deliver life-changing and life-saving new medicines for conditions such as dementia, cancer and heart disease.

‘The results of this survey show that the majority of people accept this but that there is room for improvement on openness and transparency within the field.’

Confusion? Many do not know Britain's stance on animal testing, which was banned for make-up in 1998

The polls also revealed that many people believe their cosmetics have been tested on animals.

In fact animal testing of beauty products has been banned in Britain since 1998.

And since last year, it has been illegal to sell make-up and personal care products such as shampoo and shower gel tested on animals anywhere in the world.
