England have unveiled their new kit ahead of the autumn internationals - with the home design to be worn for the first time when Stuart Lancaster's men host the All Blacks on November 8.

The red rose has been moved to the centre of the shirts for the first time ever, directly above the title sponsor O2, and the 'Test' jersey is available for a hefty £90. However, there is also a 'Pro' version, which can be bought for the cheaper price of £55.

With the traditional all-white home jersey being largely unchanged aside from the re-positioning of the rose and the introduction of new ball-deadening grip on the chest, the alternate kit is somewhat different to the previous edition.

In a to England's heritage, the St George's Cross and the red rose, Lancaster's men will wear a crimson shirt and navy blue shorts.

While the white kit will be worn against New Zealand at Twickenham in the first QBE international, the crimson shirt will be used for the first time against Samoa on November 22.

Head coach Lancaster said: 'The England shirt is a source of huge pride for the players and it's a special moment when they receive it before an international as it represents many things - those that have supported the players on their path to becoming an England player, former internationals who have worn the shirt before them, all those who are involved in and support the game and the English nation as a whole.

'That pride in wearing the shirt is massively important to the players and hopefully it is something the fans can see and connect with.

'The support for the squad over the past few seasons has been fantastic and it really means a lot to the players, the coaches and the wider support team that we all look to build that English national identity on the way to the World Cup. In the meantime, all our focus is now on the QBE Internationals and more importantly that first game against New Zealand.'

The core values of England Rugby are also emblazoned onto the reverse of the 'Test' and 'Pro' shirts, with the words Teamwork, Respect, Enjoyment, Discipline and Sportsmanship visible in the design.

England second row and Canterbury ambassador, Geoff Parling, is also impressed by the new kit design.

He said: 'There is something special about wearing the English rose on your chest, whether you're a player about to step on the pitch at Twickenham or a fan cheering the team on from the touch line

'One of the highest honours is to play for your country and there is something magical and unique about playing for England and being able to say you've worn the rose.'
