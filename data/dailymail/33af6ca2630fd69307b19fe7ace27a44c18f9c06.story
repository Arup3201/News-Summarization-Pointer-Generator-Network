Louis van Gaal will allow his players to have Christmas dinner at home with their families before reporting to Manchester United’s team hotel for the Boxing Day clash with Newcastle at Old Trafford.

The Dutchman complained recently that he will not be able to see much of his own family over Christmas because United play away at Tottenham two days later on December 28.

But it is understood that Van Gaal has arranged training around the players on Christmas Day so that they are able to enjoy as much of it at home as possible.
