Alan Davies is understood to have been involved in an altercation with the man

Actor Alan Davies has been accused of grabbing the throat of a climbing instructor as he visited a leisure centre with his children.

The 48-year-old is understood to have been at Swiss Cottage Leisure Centre in north London when instructor Eamonn O'Connor claims he tried to walk past the family on the stairs. 

Mr O'Connor said the actor, famed by the Jonathan Creek television series, grabbed him by the throat, claiming he had 'lost it'. 

Metropolitan Police officers were called to the scene though no arrests were made in connection with the incident. 

'When he reached the bottom of the stairs he just turned and went for me,' the instructor told the Sun. 

'He just flipped. He grabbed me by the throat.

'He was growling and not making any sense. The only words I heard were "I've got my kids with me".

A Metropolitan Police spokesman tonight confirmed officers responded to reports of a scuffle on stairs at the leisure centre  but that no arrests had been made in connection with the incident.

'Police were called on 10 October to reports of an altercation between two men at Swiss Cottage Leisure Centre.

'No parties involved required hospital treatment.One man, aged 48, was interviewed under caution on suspicion of common assault. 

'He was not arrested. Following an investigation which included analysis of available CCTV and speaking to witnesses, a decision was taken that there would be no further action.'

MailOnline has contacted representatives for Mr Davies. 

The incident is said to have taken place at Swiss Cottage Leisure Centre in north London in October
