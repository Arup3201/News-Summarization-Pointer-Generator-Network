Tennis rivals Maria Sharapova and Serena Williams have been involved in a war of words as they prepare to meet at Wimbledon.

In recent interviews the female tennis stars have traded barbs over their private lives and William's
controversial comments over the rape of a 16-year-old girl by two high 
school students in Steubenville.

Both women have intertwined dating histories as Sharapova's new tennis star boyfriend, Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov, is rumored to have dated Williams as well.

In a Rolling Stone interview Williams delivered thinly veiled insults about Sharapova's romantic involvement with Dimitrov.

'There are people who live, breathe and 
dress tennis. I mean, seriously, give it a rest,' Williams told Rolling 
Stone magazine, without naming Sharapova.

'She begins every interview with "I'm so
happy. I'm so lucky" -- it's so boring. She's still not going to be 
invited to the cool parties. And, hey, if she wants to be with the guy 
with a black heart, go for it.'

In her pre-Wimbledon press conference Sharapova fired back at Williams, according to the Times of India.

Sharapova criticized Williams over her romantic links with her French coach Patrick Mouratoglou, CBS Sports said.

'If
she wants to talk about something personal, maybe she should talk about
her relationship and her boyfriend that was married and is getting a 
divorce and has kids,' she said.

Sharapova also spoke out against the controversial comments Williams made to Rolling Stone  earlier this month seemingly defending the boys who raped a 16-year-old girl in Steubenville, Ohio.

'I just think she should be talking 
about her accomplishments, her achievements, rather than everything else
that's just getting attention and controversy,' Sharapova said at the press conference.

She added, 'Nobody really cares about what I have 
to say, my opinions. If I speak to my friends, that's one thing. But I 
don't go out and try to create things that shouldn't be really talked 
about.'

In the article 16-time grand slam winner Williams says the perpetrators of the crime 'did something stupid,' and asks, 'Do you think it was fair, what they got?'

She adds, 'I'm not blaming the girl, but if you're a 16-year-old and you're drunk like that, your parents should teach you: Don't take drinks from other people.'

After the interview in Rolling Stone, Williams apologized to the family of the rape victim.

'We just read Serena's updated comments and we're proud of her for correcting and clarifying her prior statements,' the family said, according to a statement issued on their behalf by attorney Bob Fitzsimmons.

'We are sure Serena has and will continue to use her God-given talents to advance women's equality and send the message that rape is never acceptable under any circumstance. '

'We are fans of Serena and will continue rooting for many more championships but more importantly watching her advance the cause of rape victims who are never to blame.'
