It's certainly a romantic gesture - putting a message in a bottle and throwing it into the sea in the hope it reaches its destination.

But perhaps it's not the most practical way of expressing yourself, as one bottle took 28 years to be discovered - nearly 5,000 miles away.

In 1985 a man called Jonathon penned the note 'Mary, you are really great person. I hope we can keep in correspondence. I said I would write. Your friend forever, Jonathon, Nova Scotia, 1985,' tucked it into a bottle, and threw it into the Atlantic ocean.

A man called Jonathon is believed to have thrown the bottle containing a sentimental note into the Atlantic

The bottle washed up in Ploce - almost 4,000 miles from where it believed to have been flung in the sea

Now, finally, it has been washed ashore and discovered in Croatia, almost 8,000 kilometres (4,971 miles) away.

The message, written in blue ink with a ball-point pen was still intact because it was plastic coated, and found by 23-year-old Croatian Matea Medak Rezic, Yahoo reported.

'The bottle was among the rubbish that winter rains have brought to the shore,' Rezic told AFP.

Ms Rezic, who found the sentimental note as she helped with a beach clean-up near the Adriatic port of Ploce, near Dubrovnik, is now appealing for the mystery pair to come forward.

She has posted a picture of the note and bottle on Facebook, writing: 'Message in a Bottle! From Canada to the Neretva River estuary for 28 years!!' The Province reported.

The bottle was thrown into the ocean in Nova Scotia in 1985 and turned up in Croatia 28 years later

The message in a bottle took 28 years to be washed ashore - and now the finer is trying to reach the writer

Twitter users have speculated about the relationship between the couple, and how Jonathon could have expected it to reach Mary.

If the bottle was thrown from Nova Scotia, it could have travelled across the Atlantic and into the Mediterranean Sea.

To reach the Adriatic Sea, it is possible that it could have gone through the Strait of Gibralter.

It certainly took a lot longer than a romantic message-in-a-bottle from China, which took just six days to be washed ashore on a Scottish beach and discovered by a mother and daughter.

Last August Nicola MacFarlane, 41, and daughter Lucy, four, from Portobello, near Edinburgh, were scouring Portobello Beach when they came across an old glass bottle sticking out of the sand containingÂ  a note inside written in Mandarin.

While the letter bears the date in line with the lunar calendar - July 7, 2012 - it could have been sent off as recently as six days previously if it followed the modern calendar.
