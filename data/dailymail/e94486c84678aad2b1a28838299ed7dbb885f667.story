She is currently smitten with fiance David McIntosh, but Kelly Brook would be the first to admit she has had a tumultuous past when it comes to men.

Having a string of highly-publicised relationships under her belt the 34-year-old, who has recently opened up about her desire to start a family with David, has also opened up about rugby player ex Danny Cipriani in her new autobiography Close Up.

In extracts reproduced by the Metro the model says: 'When I went out with Danny Cipriani, he made sure he was at the stage door every night. As much as he says he wanted to be private, there wasn't one minute when he looked like he wanted things to be private. He loved the attention.'

Kelly has revealed that Danny Cipriani, who she dated in 2013, loved the media attention that came with their relationship

In her new autobiography 'Close Up' the model also talks candidly about her large breasts 

Kelly and Danny got together in January 2013, just weeks after she split from his former London Wasps teammate Thom Evans, 28.

They split in August 2013 amongst a flurry of rumours about Danny's infidelities. Kelly threw herself into work for the next year and also met her now fiance David. 

Kelly has raised a few eyebrows recently by launching a 'plus-size' clothing range despite only being a slim 10 herself, but there can be no denying that it is her curves that made Kelly Brook's famous.

And Kelly agrees, even dedicating her autobiography to her chest.

'Today, more women are being celebrated for having curves than ever before.' She said: 'I've often wondered where I'd be without my boobs. They've been the most consistently spoken about thing in my career.'

Despite starting her career stripping of for red top newspapers and lads mags Kelly isn't a huge fan of the industry, telling The Metro: 'I had to become a glamour model when I was 16 - there just wasn't anything else. But my daughter will have a different upbringing. She's not going to be hanging out in pubs all weekend. She'll be hanging out with me on film sets.'
