A Maryland teen has been accused of murdering his grandparents in their home.

Joseph Minoglio, 19, was arrested in Virginia after Joseph Minoglio, 84, and Peggy Minoglio, 78, were found dead Saturday in pools of their own blood after sustaining several stab wounds, police said.

The teen was taken into custody by Virginia authorities after they spotted him driving a Chevrolet Cavalier registered to the elderly couple.

Authorities say the teen stabbed the pair to death before 6.00pm Saturday and skipped town. 

The bodies were found in two separate downstairs rooms, Washington County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Carly Hose told the Herald-Mail. The senior Joseph MInoglio was stabbed at least 15 times, she added.

A knife believed to have been used in the killings was recovered inside the home, Hose noted.

It is not clear who discovered the bodies or called 911, but police said the couple was well-liked.

‘I know they were loved and well-known in the community,’ said Close. ‘And this has definitely sent shock waves throughout the [community],’ she added. ‘A lot of people ... knew this family.’

No motive has yet been established in the grisly murders.

Deputies quickly noticed the Minoglio’s Cavalier was also missing and put out an all-points bulletin for its retrieval.

Authorities in Montgomery County Virginia, in the southwestern part of the state, found the vehicle and the accused killer about six hours later.

The teen was charged with one count of first-degree murder and two counts of second-degree murder.

He is being held in Virginia pending extradition to Maryland, a hearing is expected Monday.
