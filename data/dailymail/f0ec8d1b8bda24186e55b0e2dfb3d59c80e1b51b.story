Around 3.8 million military veterans will miss out on disability compensation if the government shutdown continues into late October, it emerged today.

And some 315,000 vets and 202,000 surviving spouses and dependents will see pension payments stopped, said Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki.

But as Shinseki prepares to testify Wednesday in a House hearing about the federal budget stalemate's impact on veterans services, a key Republican is demanding information about an expensive public relations campaign the agency has been running since before the shutdown began.

Florida Rep. Jeff Miller, who chairs the House Veterans Affairs Committee, wrote to Shinseki on Tuesday to fund out why his agency 'has continued to run a costly advertising campaign, including expensive television commercials during National Football League games and Major League Baseball playoffs.'

'It appears,' Miller contends, 'that VA spent more than $1 million on television advertisements from September 9th through October 13 , 2013, in the Washington, D.C. metro area alone.'

Bad timing? A $1 million public relations campaign is not what the VA wants lawmakers to see while it's complaining about shutdown-related budget shortfalls

The VA sent MailOnline a statement saying that its 'outreach campaign' is 'part of a comprehensive effort to inform Veterans of the benefits and services they have earned and deserved.'

But the ad doesn't discuss specific VA benefits, nor does it refer to the shutdown. It tells the story of a female veteran who thanks the agency, vaguely, for helping her grandparents and great-grandparents after they retired from active military duty.

'Every generation of my family has served, and VA has served us all,' the ad's voice-over says.

In a separate inquiry, Kansas Republican Sen. Jerry Moran has demanded to know how the VA justified spending $526,000 on artwork at the end of the fiscal year, as shutdown fears loomed largest.

Despite its ability to afford the pricey ad blitz and the artwork, the VA now blames shutdown-related furloughs for what it expects will be an increased backlog in processing disability claims.

An agency spokesperson said in a statement that 
it would no longer be able to assign workers to 'overtime that has 
helped VA significantly reduce the disability claims backlog by more 
than 190,000 claims over the last six months.'

The agency has required its claims processors to work at least 20 hours of overtime ever month since taking a more aggressive approach to the problem in mid-May, according to Military.com News.

Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki, a retired U.S. Army four-star general, is facing criticism for heavy spending on nonessential plans like TV ad blitzes and artwork purchases while his agency faced the same shutdown-related cuts as other government offices

Demanding answers: Rep. Jeff Miller (L) and Sen. Jerry Moran (R) want to know why the VA is spending heavily on fluff while leaving hundreds of thousands of veterans' disability claims in a backlog file

Between the overtime strategy and a new paperless claims system, the backlog of 611,000 cases in March shrunk to about 418,500 when the partial government shutdown kicked in.

7,000 of the furloughed workers were posted at the Veterans Benefits Administration, and the rest were employed at the VA’s Office of Information Technology, which runs the more efficient paperless system.

Indiana resident Joseph Lohman, a U.S. Marine corporal who served four years before a training accident left him disabled last year, held an all-night, all-day vigil on a freeway overpass this week with an upside down American flag -- a signal of distress

While programs assisting veterans slow to a crawl, regional offices are shuttered and the backlog in those disability claims trends in the wrong direction, a stalemate has brought one house of Congress to act and the other to sit on its collective hands.

As the shutdown took shape a week ago, Republicans in the House of Representatives began executing a plan to fund a dozen popular parts of the federal government through separate budget measures, while leaving more contentious programs for later negotiations.

The Department of Veterans Affairs was the subject of one of those bills. On Oct. 3. 224 Republicans and 35 Democrats approved the legislation and sent it to the Democrat-controlled Senate.

But despite bipartisan support for the resolutions – others included funding for Head Start, the National Institutes of Health, and nutrition for Women, Infants and Children programs – the White House has threatened vetoes and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has declined to bring them up for votes.

'Consideration of appropriations bills in a piecemeal fashion is not a serious or responsible way to run the United States Government,' read a White House statement issued Oct. 2.

President Obama did, however, sign into law a Republican-backed measure guaranteeing the paychecks of active-duty servicemen and women during the partial shutdown. His signature came two hours before the spending freeze took effect.

And Sen. Ted Cruz, the fiery Texas conservative, said Tuesday that such 'piecemeal' funding measures are 'the traditional means of appropriating and legislating that for centuries this [Senate] has done.'

He also said funding soldiers' paychecks and veterans' benefits should go hand-in-hand.

'If we could work together in a bipartisan manner to say we're not going to hold the men and women of the military hostage,' Cruz asked, 'why can't we work together in a bipartisan manner to say we're not going to hold our veterans hostage?'

Veterans made their voices heard on Oct. 2 after U.S. Park Police erected barricades to block access to national parks and memorials. Some Republicans have claimed the Obama administration made the shutdown as inconvenient as possible in order to inspire Americans to demand a quick resolution

Sen. Ted Cruz talked with World War II veterans at their outdoor memorial on Tuesday in Washington. He snapped at Democrats for holding veterans 'hostage' in the prolonged budget fight

Senate Democrats have joined Obama in holding out for a more comprehensive solution, a so-called 'clean continuing resolution' that would fund the entire government at once, with no strings attached.

Republican House Speaker John Boehner has refused to bring that measure to the floor because his conference requires one very specific string: language that would change portions of the Affordable Care Act that the GOP finds objectionable.

President Obama continued to play tough on Tuesday, telling Republicans he would refuse to negotiate over government spending until they had surrendered and reinstated funding across the board

No Republican lawmaker voted in favor of the act, better known as the Obamacare law, when it passed in March 2010. And President Obama has made several changes to the law without consulting Congress.

Republicans say one such change, a year-long delay in the law's requirement that businesses offer their employees health insurance plans, should be matched by a similar delay in the law's provision that requires individual taxpayers to sign up for coverage.

While the two sides duke it out on the political stage, the individual program funding bills languish in the Senate, with Republicans crying foul and Democrats insisting on an all-or-nothing endgame.

Tuesday's statement from the VA, itself an arm of the Obama administration, demanded the latter approach.

'Clear progress for veterans and their families is at risk,' it read, 'without immediate action by Congress to make fiscal year 2014 funding available by passing a clean continuing resolution to reopen the government.'

The VA also warned that more basic services like payments related to 'pension, education and vocational rehabilitation programs' could be suspended after late October 'when available funding is exhausted.'

The agency's most visible program – its hospitals and other health-care delivery operations – will be immune from the shutdown axe since they're considered 'essential' services.
