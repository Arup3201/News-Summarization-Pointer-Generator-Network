The two children were injured Saturday when a bounce house became untethered have spoken out about the terrifying experience.

Friends AJ Ruder, 11, and 12-year-old Madison Kelsay were playing together in the bouncy castle on Saturday while their siblings competed in a lacrosse tournament at a Littleton, Colorado park.

When the bounce castle became detached from its stakes in the ground, the two were taken for a painful ride, 300 feet across the soccer field. Madison fell out of the castle along the way, but Ruder was trapped inside until the house finally came to a rest and says he lost consciousness.Â

Tumbling: A spectator at the lacrosse tournament took video of the bounce slide being blown 300 feet across the soccer field

Must be stopped: Parents are seen in the video chasing after the castle, trying to bring it to rest

Injured: Both children were treated at the scene and one of the ten-year-olds was taken to urgent care

'It was like I was picked up into the air and I was just thrown around a lot,' A.J. Ruder told ABC News. 'I couldn't get a grip on anything.'

'By the time I hit the ground, I just pretty much blacked out,' he said

The two children escaped with just minor injuries, and AJ sported a brace on his left foot during the GMA interview.

However, when the parents saw their children flung around in the bounce house they feared much worse.

Thankfully, Madison and AJ received only minor injuries. AJ pictured above wearing a brace on his left foot

'It was just complete terror,' Madison's mother Cassie Kelsay said.

'He was emotionless, expressionless,' AJ's dad Brian Ruder said of when he saw his son laying helpless on the ground. 'His eyes were opened in shock.'

Madison says she won't be going back into a bounce house anytime soon while AJ says he won't enter one ever again.

Brian Ruder says his son was emotionless, and expressionless, when he found him lying helpless on the ground after the incident

Airbound, the company that owns and operates the slide, issued a statement to ABC, saying: 'We feel terrible for what happened. Safety is our No. 1 concern.'

Saturday's incident comes just a few weeks after another boucne castle in upstate New York was blown away, seriously injured two children.

Earlier last month, two children were seriously injured when another bouncy castle took flight in South Glens Falls, New York
