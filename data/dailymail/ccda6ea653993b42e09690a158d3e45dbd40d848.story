A model of Knut, the 'celebrity polar bear', which uses his real fur and claws, has gone on display in Berlin two years after he tragically died of a heart attack.Â 

The much-loved bear was just four-years-old when he 
suffered a brain aneurism and
toppled into the water of his enclosure, and drowned. It was a tragic 
end for a creature who once captivated the world.

Knut had been rejected by his mother at birth and raised by his
keeper Thomas Doerflein. Resembling a real-life teddy, the polar cub 
quickly shot to world wide fame and his fluffy white face even grazed 
the cover of Vanity Fair.

Memorial: The sculpture of celebrity polar bear Knut has been put on display at the Museum of Natural History in Berlin

Celebrity status: Knut is the centre of attention once again as photographers jostle to take pictures of the model which uses the animal's real hide

Yesterday, Berlin's Natural History Museum unveiled his statue prepared by taxidermists featuring the famous Berlin Zoo bear's fur and claws, with the synthetic body and glass eyes.

The museum is keen to stress that Knut has not been stuffed. Rather, a replica of the bear was made, based on Knut's skeleton, in one of his favourite poses, and this was covered with the creature's pelt, in a procedure known as dermoplasty.

The model has expressive eyes and a damp nose, museum director Johannes Vogel said.

Popular polar-oid: Knut, posing for a photograph in 2009, will be shown at the museum until March before getting a permanent 
display next year

Adorable: Knut shot to worldwide fame when he greeted the crowds 
at the Berlin Zoo in 2007 having been hand-reared by his keeper after 
his mother abandoned him

He added: 'I think people will accept
Knut, because this is a very dignified model.. People who knew Knut 
very well while he was alive recognise their Knut here again.'

The daily shows of Thomas feeding 
Knut attracted visitors from as far away as Siberia and he quickly 
became addicted to the lime light, playing it up for the cameras.

However
Knut became increasingly dependent on the spotlight and the visitors' 
attention as he began the weaning off from Mr Doerflein.

When Mr Doerflein suddenly died from a heart attack in 2008, Knut became withdrawn and depressed.

Celebrity status: Knut became a worldwide media sensation as a cub when he survived rejection by his mother and attracted more than a million visitors to Berlin's zoo

Lifelike: The polar bear will be exhibited at the museum for one month

He would only become animated when cameras were clicking and adoring crowds were waiting at the railings of his enclosure.

Even
Knut's final moment were captured by visitors. Suffering a brain 
aneurysm in his enclosure, the adoring crowds saw him stand, stagger and
finally topple into the water to meet his watery end.

He will go on display from February 16 until March 15 when he will be archived until a permanent Knut exhibition opens in 2014.

Other German zoos have tried in vain to create celebrity animals. None have ever come close to matching Knut's fame.

Papa bear: Knut was 'adopted' by keeper Thomas Doerflein, and struggled when staff tried to wean him off his human 'father' and sunk into depression when Doerflein died in 2008

Fame fix: Knut loved the public as much as they loved him, something which became an addiction and led to him being branded 'psycho bear' by experts
