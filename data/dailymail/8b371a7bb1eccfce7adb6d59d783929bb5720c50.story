Schoolboy Jake Foushee has taken his bid to become a voice actor by the throat.

The 14-year-old has become an internet sensation after posting a video of himself voicing a mock film trailer in the style of 'Voiceover King' Don LaFontaine.

The 32-second clip, which has been viewed over 144,000 times, was filmed in Jake's bedroom at his home in America.

144,000 hits: Jake Foushee, 14, has become an internet sensation after posting a video of himself voicing a mock film trailer in the style of 'Voiceover King' Don LaFontaine

He begins by telling the audience of his hopes of becoming a voice actor before introducing his 'movie trailer guy impression'.

In a gravelly voice that belies his tender years, the schoolboy launches into the stirring impression.

'In a world where the Earth was no 
longer in our control, with our survival at stake,' he growls. 'We have one chance 
and that chance is to fight back. Get ready for the most thrill-ride 
motion picture event of the year: Apocalypse. In theatres everywhere. 
Friday.'

The impression bares a remarkable likeness to film-trailer legend Don LaFontaine, who died in 2008, aged 68.

His voice had become one of the most recognisable on earth after voicing more than 5,000 movie trailers including The Godfather Part II, Dr Strangelove, Ghostbusters, Home Alone and Terminator.

He also lent his voice to numerous 
U.S. TV shows including Entertainment Tonight and The Insider and 
thousands of advertisements.

His trailer catchphrase 'In a world where...' has long passed into cinematic folklore and has been much parodied.

LaFontaine, who has headlined the 
voiceover industry for 25 years, was also the in-show announcer for the 
Academy Awards and the Screen Actors Guild Awards.
