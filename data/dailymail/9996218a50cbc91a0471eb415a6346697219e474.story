One photographer has captured her pregnant friends - and complete strangers - asleep in their homes for 'Waiting', a project exploring growing families.

'A couple of years ago, I suddenly noticed that almost all my friends were about to become mothers and father,' says Jana Romanova, 29, from St Petersburg, Russia.

'I wasn't really ready for this 
unexpected change in my life, because I couldn't imagine it without 
spontaneous travels and night talks about our amazing future,' she explains. Jana decided documenting the process might help her make sense of it.

'My
 favorite people were about to become real adults with a lot of 
responsibilities, and they all took the change in a very 
different way, acting like a happy family in public and sometimes crying 
in fear of the prospect when nobody was watching.

'I
 started photographing my friends, their friends and, in the end, people
 I don't know, in the most personal and intimate place - their bedroom -
 early in the morning while they were sleeping or drowsy.

'It's a time 
when people don't care about their appearance, being natural, and 
looking at the photographs I tried to understand what kind of roles a 
young man and woman play in their new family.'

The series of photographs of sleeping young Russian couples expecting a baby, dubbed 'Waiting', was shot from 2009-2011

As she wanted her photos to be as natural as possible, the photographer sometimes waited until five or six in the morning to get the perfect shot. The bird's eye view was achieved with Jana standing on a ladder, giving the viewer an intriguing vantage point.

Over
 two years, the photographer took 40 photos of 40 couples, with 
each picture representing a week of pregnancy.

In this way, Jana was able to capture feelings and emotions from all stages of pregnancy - from the moment when a couple realise their little partnership is expanding, to the very real prospect of a baby coming into their lives.

'From when he hasn't yet realised 
he's going to be a 
father, and she is alone with the knowledge of the small life 
growing inside her, to the stage where he becomes a child himself - 
rejecting this new responsibility, and, after that, coming to a moment 
where he awakens and, slowly, they start to play equal roles in the 
process of waiting for their arrival,' as Jana describes it.

'They are waiting not only for a child to be born, but also for their entire life to be changed in 40 weeks.'

The early morning, Jana says, is the time when people don't really care about their appearance and one can see how they relate to one another

Jana's friends started getting pregnant and were about to become real adults with a lot of responsibilities, which inspired her to start her project

Subjects
 are all young Russian couples aged from 20 to 30, asleep or
 dozing, taken between 2009 and 2011 in Saint Petersburg and Moscow.

Jana Romanova was born in 1984 in 
Russia, and got a degree in journalism from Saint Petersburg State 
University. She won the PDN Photo Annual (USA) in 2011 and Photography 
Book Now by Blurb 2011 in documentary category. In 2011 she started 
teaching documentary photography at the Faculty of Photojournalists in 
Saint Petersburg.
