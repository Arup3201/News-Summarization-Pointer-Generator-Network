A senior GP is under investigation for telling gay junior doctors to avoid acting effeminately around patients.

Dr Una Coales said if they deepened their voices and changed the way they walked they would stand a better chance of impressing their examiners.

In a guidebook written for medics sitting clinical skills tests, she advised doctors from Africa and Asia to try speaking in ‘lyrical’ Scottish or Welsh accents if they wanted jobs in those countries.

And she told women doctors not to wear
 overly-feminine, flowery dresses – in case patients mistake them for 
nurses. Bizarrely, she even advised overweight medical students to 
project an ‘image of Santa Claus’ by interlocking their fingers over 
their bellies.

Dr Coales is a senior member of the 
Royal College of General Practitioners’ Council and earlier this year 
narrowly missed out on being elected its president.

She made her comments in a guidebook 
for junior doctors sitting their ‘Clinical Skills Assessments’, which 
are exams taken in their final year. In one passage, she wrote: ‘One 
candidate was facing a third sitting and yet no one had told him that 
his mannerisms, gait and speech were too overtly gay.

‘So I advised him to lower and deepen his high-pitched voice and neutralise his body movements.

‘He went back to his surgery, 
practised his speech until his voice went hoarse and modified his body 
language. Not only did he pass his exam, but he informed me he noticed a
 huge difference in the way patients interacted with him.’

She also told women not to wear 
flowery dresses because ‘if you dress like a nurse they [patients] have 
difficulty believing they are seeing “the doctor”.’

The Royal College of GPs has now 
launched an inquiry into her comments, which have provoked outrage on 
the social networking site Twitter. Dr Coales, who trained in America 
before becoming a GP in South London, could now be ordered to leave the 
College.

Ruth Hunt, director of public affairs 
at the gay and equality charity Stonewall, described the advice as an 
‘absurd waste of a medical students’ time’.

Clare Gerada, the Chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners, makes her opposition to Dr Coales' comments clear

‘The RCGP should be seriously 
concerned if those assumptions really are present during medical 
students’ instructions and exams.’

Neil Hunt, chief executive of the 
College said: ‘The RCGP does not endorse the book, the author did not 
write it in her capacity as a member of the RCGP Council, and we reject 
the advice given.

‘I have referred the matter to the senior officer team of the College.’

On her website, Dr Coales claims she ‘understands all views because she has lived them’.

She has written several medical revision books as well as guides on how to lose weight.
