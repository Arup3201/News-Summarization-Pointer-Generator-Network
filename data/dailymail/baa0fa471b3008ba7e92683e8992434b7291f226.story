This is the moment an angry punter punched a woman cashier twice in the face - because he lost a bet.

Horrified gamblers could only watch as the man, wearing a green T-shirt, leaned over the counter that had no protective glass, and punched the woman as she went about her work.

He then walked casually out of the branch of Ladbrokes, after the attack at 10.10am on Sunday.

Luckily the entire incident and the man's face up close was captured on the shop's CCTV system.

Shocking: The angry punter punched the cashier after realising he had lost a bet

Full swing: The attack happened in a branch of Ladbrokes at 10.10am on Sunday

Yesterday a 29-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of assault. His face and that of the cashier have been obscured for legal reasons.

A police spokeswoman, said: 'The man approached a cashier with a betting slip and when he was told he had not won he swore at her and was asked to leave the shop.

'He then lunged over the desk towards the cashier and punched the woman in the face twice before leaving.

'She was left with bruising and swelling below the eye.'

A spokesman for Ladbrokes said: 
'Incidents like this are always distressing for those involved but we 
have excellent security procedures and the best CCTV in the business, 
the images from which we are using to assist the police with their 
inquiries.'

Another 
spokesman added security screens to protect staff were in place in some 
shops. He said: 'If they don't (have screens) it's usually a sign that 
the shop is generally quite safe and has few security incidents.'

Ladbrokes confirmed last night that the man involved stood to win just Â£1.20 from his bet.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
