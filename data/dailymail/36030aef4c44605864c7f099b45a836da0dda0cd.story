A Texas mother who was intent on getting back stolen pieces of her husband's truck set up a sting and met with the suspected criminal without realizing the alleged crook was packing heat. 

Cristina Coria, a stay-at-home mom with a nine-month old child, helped police nab the 18-year-old suspect and get back the bed of her husband's custom-painted blue 2003 Chevy Stepside.

In order to make it happen, the Houston resident got a little help from Facebook.

The sequence of events leading up to the successful sting began on Tuesday when the truck was stolen from Coria's driveway,KHOU reported.

Police discovered the vehicle the following day in a storage lot, but its bed and wheels had been stripped. 

When Coria went on Facebook after the truck was found, she saw an ad for a blue 2003 Chevy Stepside bed.

She put two and two together and arranged to meet the man with her husband at a gas station parking lot near I-45.

The police were also called. 

When the seller showed up and they determined he almost definitely had the stolen parts, Coria and her husband stalled him while waiting for police to arrive. 

Coria said: 'I took his keys.

'While [the seller] was going around his truck, I took the keys from his truck. 

'So when he was out there looking for his keys he couldn't find them; he couldn't leave.

'I watch A&E a lot.'

The police arrived after a wait Coria said approached two hours and arrested the man. 

A search of his truck turned up an illegal pistol.  

The suspect claimed he bought the truck parts on the street from a stranger outside the city.

He said he had no idea the parts were stolen, even though they were being sold at a discount and didn't come with a receipt or bill of sale. 

Police may charge him for theft and unlawfully carrying a gun.

If she had known he was armed, Coria said she 'probably would have ran'.
