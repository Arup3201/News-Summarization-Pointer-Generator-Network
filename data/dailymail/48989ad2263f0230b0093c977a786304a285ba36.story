FC Rostov head coach Igor Gamula has been suspended for five matches after being found guilty of making racist comments, the Russian Football Union (RFS) said in a statement on Wednesday.

Ukrainian-born Gamula said he wouldn't sign any more black players and joked that Ebola had spread to his club at a press conference last month, but after his comments were published the coach insisted he was joking and the English media didn't understand his 'Russian humour'.

Asked after the match against Ural Ekaterinburg on October 31 if Rostov had signed Cameroon defender, Benoit Angbwa, who attended the game, Gamula said: 'We already have six black players, do you want me to get a seventh? Angbwa just lives here, we will not be buying him.'

The 54-year-old Gamula's comments caused a storm in the media, especially in Britain.

'I immediately told the journalist that my remarks were between him and me and it was a joke. He took the quote and published it,' Gamula said.

'I will say it again - it was a joke. I have a great relationship with all the team's dark skinned players. The British press just doesn't understand our Russian humour.'

Rostov's South Africa central defender Siyanda Xulu didn't see the funny side of the 'joke' either, and said he would not train until Gamula apologised to all of the club's dark-skinned players.

Gamula personally said sorry to each of the players in question and they all shook hands with him.

South Africa's Minister for Sport, Fikile Mbalula, and South African FA president Danny Jordaan have asked FIFA to look further into Gamula's comments.

'Any country that is going to host the World Cup should be hospitable to any race or nation, without discrimination because of the colour of a person's skin and in particular Russia,' Jordaan said referring to the 2018 finals. 

'Therefore I believe that he (Gamula) deserves the harshest possible punishment. This is not the first time that such things have been said in Russia.'

Angbwa (right), previously of Krylia Sovetov,  had been linked with a move to struggling Rostov 

Dynamo Moscow's Congo defender Christopher Samba and Zenit St Petersburg's Brazil striker Hulk were both victims of racist abuse by opposition fans during matches in September.

'Of course, you need to watch what you say, especially when we are trying to battle against racism,' RFS vice president Nikita Simonyan said after Wednesday's disciplinary committee meeting.

'If you want my personal opinion, I think Gamula said he was sorry enough times. He literally slapped himself in his face for making such an unfortunate joke.'

Gamula said the RFS had told him not to comment on his ban.
