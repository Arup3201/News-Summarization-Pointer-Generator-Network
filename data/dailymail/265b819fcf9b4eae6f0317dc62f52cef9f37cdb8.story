Police have made 31 arrests after the audacious £31million diamond heist at Brussels Airport in February

Police have arrested at least 31 people across three countries as part of their investigation into a spectacular £31million diamond heist.

Heavily armed robbers dressed as policeman made off with the huge haul after the audacious theft from Brussels Airport in February.

There had been no news of any leads on the robbery, believed to be one of the largest ever recorded, until today's surprise announcement.

Authorities said a Frenchman has been arrested in France while six to eight have been detained in Geneva, Switzerland, and a further 24 people in and around Brussels.

Among those arrested were a prominent businessman and a lawyer.

Police also believe they have recovered some of the diamonds taken in the robbery.

The precious gems
had been loaded onto a plane bound for Zurich when the gang drove through a hole they had cut in the Brussels Airport fence in two black cars with blue police lights flashing.

They 
drove onto the tarmac, approached the plane, brandished machine guns, 
offloaded at least 120 packages containing diamonds, then made their getaway in an operation that 
barely took five minutes. 

Later that night, investigators found the 
charred remains of a van most likely used in the heist, but little else.

The stolen parcels contained both rough and polished stones.

Suspects in France and Switzerland were detained on Tuesday, and today Belgian police carried out a massive operation, with 250 police involved in 40 house searches.

'In Switzerland, we have found diamonds that we can already say are coming from the heist, and in Belgium large amounts of money have been found. And the investigation is still ongoing,' said Jean-Marc Meilleur, a spokesman for the Brussels prosecutor's office. He said police had also found luxury cars.

Authorities were expected to announce later Wednesday how many of the detainees would be charged and arrested.

In Geneva, a police statement said that 'a very important quantity of diamonds was seized' during the sweep 'coming from the spectacular heist at Brussels airport.'

Mr Meilleur said that the man held in France is suspected to be one of the robbers. 'This person has a very heavy judicial background in France and his extradition to Belgium has been requested.'

Belgian authorities said that about 10 of the 24 people detained in Belgium were known criminals. The suspects ranged in age from 30 to 50, they said.

The diamond industry, was surprised by the development 'but we can only be happy,' said Caroline De Wolf, spokeswoman for the Antwerp World Diamond Center.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
