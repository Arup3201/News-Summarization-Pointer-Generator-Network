Two suspects in the killing of U.S. ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens have been arrested in Instanbul, according to reports.

The pair, believed to be Tunisian nationals, were detained while trying to enter Turkey at Ataturk Airport.

Mr Stevens was one of four Americans who died when Islamist gunmen stormed the Benghazi consulate last month.

A member of the foreign 
service and two former Navy Seal bodyguards were also killed after terrorists
overran the consulate and set fire to it. Mr Stevens was the first US 
ambassador to die in the line of duty since 1979.

Turkish broadcaster Kanal D reported the arrests on its website today. The two suspected are believed to have tried to enter the country using fake passports.

Police in Istanbul have declined to comment on the report.

The consulate, located in the city of
Benghazi, was reportedly bombed twice in the months leading up to the 
attack, which occurred on the 11th anniversary of the September 11 
terror attacks.

The State Department is currently conducting an internal investigation into the Benghazi attack.

President Obama has ordered both the CIA and the Pentagon to hunt down the terrorists who attacked the consulate.

It is unclear what the president plans to do once the perpetrators of 
the assault in Benghazi are found, but he has mobilised the
military's Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) to help carry out the 
mission.

JSOC and the CIA teamed up to send Navy Seal commandos into Pakistan in 2011 for a raid that killed Osama bin Laden.

The
White House plans for retaliation come after it was revealed that 
security officials missed key signs that the consulate and US Ambassador
Chris Stevens were in danger.

The Daily Beast reported
that various whistleblowers have come forward since the attack to 
testify about prior attacks and a series of threats, which are described
in a letter from Rep Darrel Issa and Rep Jason Chaffetz to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

The
letter, obtained by the site, says that both the consulate and Stevens 
were prime terror targets because threats had been made against both on 
Facebook.

One such post 
mentioned the route that Mr Stevens took on his morning jog, prompting the 
diplomat to briefly stop running for his own safety

The letter also mentions two separate 
bombings on the consulate - one on April 6 (when two former security 
guards hurled improvised explosives at the building) and another on June
6.

Neither attack resulted in deaths or injuries.

Meanwhile it has been alleged that 
the State Department denied a request from the security team at the US 
embassy in Libya to retain the services of a DC-3 airplane in the 
country once commercial flights to the country had been reinstated.

The information was apparently contained in an email seen by 
ABC News - which was copied to Mr Stevens.

It is understood that the plane was used to get staff around Libya, not just in and out of the country.

But the allegation will raise further 
questions about the level of security support provided to diplomatic 
staff in Libya.

The
revelations came as the White House announced it was pulling all U.S. 
personnel out of Benghazi, Libya's second-largest city.

State Department spokeswoman Victoria
Nuland told The Washington Post: 'Everybody who was in Benghazi and 
posted there has been withdrawn.'

New evidence has suggested that there were obvious clues that terrorism was
involved in the attack, despite initial claims by officials that it was
a protest gone wrong.

Mr Stevens and three other Americans - Sean Smith, Tyron Woods and Glen Doherty - perished in the assault.
