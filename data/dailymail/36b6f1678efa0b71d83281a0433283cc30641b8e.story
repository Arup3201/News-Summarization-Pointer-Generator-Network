The teenager raped by a £4.5million lottery winner and benefits cheat yesterday described him as a ‘brazen psychopath’ and said she planned to sue him because of the agony he caused her.

The woman – who was 17 when Edward Putman raped her twice after breaking into her home – said she ‘would like to see him penniless’.

Putman, now 46, was sentenced to seven years for the 1991 attack, during which his victim was punched so hard she thought her head would ‘cave in’.

Victim: Lottery winner Edward Putman's victim said for him to be fabulously rich and living it up was the 'worst kind of karma' after he raped her when she was 17

Before his conviction, he also tried to intimidate a witness who had seen him in the house into withdrawing their testimony.

He declined publicity when he won his huge sum in September 2009 but his identity was revealed when he was taken to court for claiming benefits despite his huge wealth. Putman’s victim, who had previously been involved with him after being introduced by mutual friends, changed her name and fled to another part of the country to avoid ever coming into contact with him again.

She told the Mail: ‘He definitely had me in mind when he asked for no publicity [after the Lottery win].

‘I received £4,000 from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority but that didn’t make up for what happened.

‘It took a year for the case to go to court. Then he made me go through the ordeal of giving evidence. I had to stand there while he stared at me.

‘He is a brazen psychopath who told everyone what he had done when he went to prison. There was no remorse, no shame.

‘I will absolutely be claiming for compensation and will be consulting lawyers. I’d like to see him penniless. It’s not about the money – it’s about the principle.’

The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was living in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, in the early 1990s when she was attacked. She said Putman broke into her home and sat next to her in her living room where he flicked cigarette ash at her, pulled her hair and was abusive towards her before pushing her into a room.

‘He beat the **** out of me. He punched my head so hard I thought it would cave in. Then he raped me,’ she added.

‘Afterwards he sat on the bed and said “Oh my God. I know what I’ve just done”. I patronised him to get him to leave and said, “You’re just drunk. Go home.” He went down the stairs but then came up and did it again.’

The woman, who now has a family and lives in the North East of England, said Putman later persuaded a witness who was in the house to go to the police and withdraw their statement.

‘The police saw his car in the car park. He’s that stupid,’ she added. She said she met Putman through their extended group of friends and on one occasion he took her out in his car. It transpired that at the same time he was stalking his ex-partner, Gail, who last week told the Mail that Putman had concealed his win from her and their son, Sam, 26.

Gail, 51, said she had also wanted to claim compensation from Putman, a former bricklayer.

Putman was convicted of rape, indecent assault and perverting the course of justice in January 1993 at Northampton Crown Court and served four years of his sentence.

He has also been convicted of wounding with intent in a case from the mid-1980s. Friends claim he has appeared in court for other offences including burglary.

His rape victim added: ‘He is a crazy and deluded person. He can be quite charismatic – funny and charming. Then he turns...

‘This is the worst kind of karma – for him to be fabulously rich and living it up.’

Putman now lives in a £600,000 detached four-bedroom house in Kings Langley, Hertfordshire.

An investigation into his finances is understood to have begun when he tried to buy his former one-bed council flat with cash. Inquiries revealed he had continued claiming housing benefit and income support for 20 months after his lottery win.

He appeared before St Albans magistrates last Tuesday over the benefits fraud – where details of how he came by his wealth were revealed for the first time – but did not enter a plea after the Crown Prosecution Service admitted they had not worked out exactly how much he owed.

The case was adjourned until July 3 when his lawyers said he would plead guilty to two fraud charges and pay back the money.

Noble Solicitors, who represent Putman, have failed to provide a statement despite numerous requests.
