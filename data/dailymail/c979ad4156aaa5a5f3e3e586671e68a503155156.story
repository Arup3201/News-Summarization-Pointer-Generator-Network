The owner of the mansion where Valerie Graves was murdered is understood to have been some 3,000 miles away when she was killed.

But shocked businessman Malcolm Chamberlain, 66, has already spoken to detectives investigating the crime that took place while he was on holiday in Costa Rica and Miss Graves was house-sitting.

Among subjects detectives may have touched on is a ‘swinging’ site for the sexually adventurous which until recently featured a profile of a man calling himself ‘Malcolm the highlander’ and illustrated with naked photographs apparently of Mr Chamberlain.

It included an email address used by Mr Chamberlain and linked both to his home address in Bosham and his printing business in nearby Chichester.

The person posting the profile urged fellow swingers to get in touch for ‘casual sex, discreet relationships’, saying he was ‘attached and looking for discreet fun’.

Mr Chameberlain told police he was 3,000 miles away in Costa Rica when Valerie Graves (pictured) was killed

He described his job as ‘Director of fun and pleasuring’, boasted ‘I’m VERY wealthy’, and said his ‘sexual interests’ included threesomes.

Mr Chamberlain is still abroad with his wife Caroline, 63, and their two children, but his lawyer Paul Dixon said his client is mystified by how the photographs and email address have appeared on the site, and that it was nothing to do with him.

Mr Dixon said the photographs were quite old, and added: ‘It’s something Mr Chamberlain will look into when he gets back.’

Mr Chamberlain has had brushes with scandal before.

In the 1980s he was coach of the highly successful Kingston Basketball Club in south-west London, through which he met then-player Nigel Acres.

Mr Acres, now 59, went on to become a firm friend and was house-sitting in Bosham alongside girlfriend Janet Graves, 60, her mother Eileen Graves, 87, and Valerie Graves, who was found dead on Monday.

In 1985, the basketball club won the national championships, but a year later Mr Chamberlain switched jobs to manage Kingston council’s leisure centre.

In 1988, he was suspended after two of his former star basketball players were pictured at his leisure centre alongside ‘glamour model’ Paula Meadows, in a magazine feature entitled ‘Confessions of a porn star’.

Mr Chamberlain was cleared of involvement in the pictures.

More recently, he has been embroiled in a court case involving the company AV Station plc, jointly owned with his wife.

It was among companies sued by the Premier League for selling decoders to allow pubs to show satellite football matches at a cut price.
