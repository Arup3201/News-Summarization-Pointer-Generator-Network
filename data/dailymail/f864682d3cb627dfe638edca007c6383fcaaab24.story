A mother living in the heart of ISIS-controlled territory has described the terror she and her eight-year-old son face every single day as militants tighten their savage grip on power.

The woman, who has not been named for fear of reprisals, lives in the ISIS-controlled Iraqi city of Mosul, where there have been reports of torture and beheadings for anyone who falls foul of the terrorists. Her own husband was murdered and she fears her son could face a similar fate.

She has been keeping her son out of school as she fears he could be brainwashed and see horrifying scenes as he walks to school.

'I'd prefer to keep him at home, I never let him out. I'm really scared for him. I want to prevent him from seeing horrible things on the street,' she said.

'There are lots of horrible things going on and children see them. They see weapons, armoured cars and the militants in black uniforms. It's very scary for them.'

The mother, speaking to the BBC World Service, also faces the prospect of her son becoming brainwashed by the militants - even though they killed the boy's father.

She added: 'We don't know who killed him but it was Islamic militants and the reason I'm so scared for my son is because he keep saying: "these are the people who killed my dad".

'These people are ruthless, they would do horrible things to him.'

As well as the oppressive rule by ISIS, the unnamed mother spoke of power outages and food shortages in Mosul.

She added: 'There's no future.

Last week ISIS terrorists publicly executed a human rights lawyer in Mosul after she criticised the group on Facebook for destroying religious monuments.

Samira Salih al-Nuaimi was seized from her home on September 17 shortly after she allegedly posted messages on Facebook that were critical of the militants' destruction of religious sites in the city.

According to the United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq, al-Nuaimi was tried in a Sharia law court for apostasy, before being tortured for five days and eventually being sentenced to public execution.

News of al-Nuaimi's shocking death emerged after a coalition of American, French and Arab forces carried out a third night of deadly airstrikes against ISIS targets which have already killed scores of militants.

On Friday Britain launched its first combat mission against Islamic State – as the RAF launched two waves of attack against the deadly terrorists.

Two heavily-armed jets flew from a top-security RAF base in Cyprus on the dangerous sortie over IS-held territory in Northern Iraq, before returning safely to complete her 2,000-mile round trip.
