Shadow minister Willie Bain revealed that senior members of Labour leader Ed Miliband's team have asked him to examine the issue of making benefits a 'human right'

Labour is drawing up plans to make claiming benefits a ‘human right’ despite fresh evidence of overwhelming public support for the Government’s welfare crackdown.

Shadow minister Willie Bain revealed that senior members of Labour leader Ed Miliband’s team have asked him to examine the issue, despite fears it would be dubbed a ‘scroungers’ charter’.

At a dinner hosted by the socialist Fabian Society, Mr Bain, the shadow minister for Scotland, said he was looking at whether ‘economic and social rights can be put into law’.

Mr Bain, a member of the Unite trade union, said: ‘It needs really careful handling because I think the politics of this would be the Tories would say it’s a scrounger’s charter, helping skivers.

‘It would need to be bombproof if we were to do it. 

‘We might just talk about having a commission on it.’ 

Mr Bain suggested the move, which would extend ‘human rights’ into the economic field for the first time, might help Mr Miliband strike a coalition deal with Liberal Democrats leader Nick Clegg after the next election.

He said he had been asked to carry out the review by Mr Miliband’s policy chief, Jon  Cruddas, and the shadow justice secretary, Sadiq Khan.

The revelation comes as the Government’s flagship benefits cap is rolled out across the  country for the first time today.

The scheme, which has been piloted in four London boroughs, caps the maximum benefits a family can claim at £26,000 a year – a figure equal to a pre-tax salary of more than £34,000.

A poll today reveals that almost three-quarters of the public back the cap, with two-thirds saying it will help get people on benefits back into work.

The Ipsos Mori poll commissioned by the Department for Work and Pensions found that just 11 per cent of the public think the benefits system is working effectively.

Some 59 per cent said they wanted politicians to do more to cut Britain’s welfare bill. A total of 74 per cent said they supported the benefits cap.

At a dinner hosted by the socialist Fabian Society, Mr Bain, the shadow minister for Scotland, said he was looking at whether 'economic and social rights can be put into law¿'

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith claimed Mr Bain's comments showed that Labour is serious about reforming the welfare system

A third of those who said they opposed the cap said they were against it because, at £500 a week, it had been set too high.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith claimed Mr Bain’s comments showed that Labour is serious about reforming the welfare system.

He said: ‘As if we needed any more proof Labour are still the same old welfare party, Ed Miliband has now decided that claiming benefits is a human right.

‘Today this Government is capping benefits so that nobody who’s out of work can claim more than the average hardworking family earns.

Today’s findings show the British public are fully behind us in this.

‘Labour, meanwhile, are making secret plans so that people can claim unlimited benefits with absolutely no incentive to work.’ 

A Labour spokesman insisted it was not considering a change to give people a human right to claim benefits.

He said: ‘The discussion at a Fabian Society event was about methods used abroad, not something the Labour Party is considering as a policy.’
