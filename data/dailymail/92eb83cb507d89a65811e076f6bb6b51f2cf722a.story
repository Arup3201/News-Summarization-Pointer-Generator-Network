So
 many of us have been there. You're in the waiting room as your child 
goes into the operating theatre. The minutes feel like hours, and the 
hours go on for ever. 

As
 you wait for news, a nurse comes to put your mind at rest, reassuring 
you that your child is in the best possible hands. And in that moment 
you feel overwhelming gratitude towards our National Health Service. 

I
 have felt that gratitude so many times. So it was no surprise to me 
that when a poll last year asked people which institution made them  
most proud to be British, the NHS came top.

It
 really is the most precious institution in our country, one of the 
greatest achievements of the 20th century - and vitally important to my 
 family and to every family  in Britain.

But
 when we talk about our great affection for the NHS, we're not talking 
about the surgeries or the hospitals or the facilities: we're talking 
about the people - the 1.7 million health workers who treat a staggering
 one million of us every 36 hours. 

These
 people are our superstars in scrubs, our angels in aprons, and the 
Health Hero Awards give us a fantastic opportunity to thank them for 
everything they do.

And there are three reasons why I think it is so important that we do so. 

First, it allows us to show those individuals who go far beyond the call of duty that we are grateful to them. 

It
 allows us to highlight the things that cannot be measured in statistics
 or graphs or league tables - whether it's a doctor's determination to 
get to the bottom of a mystery illness; a paramedic's quick thinking in a
 life-or-death situation; or a volunteer's kind words in a patient's 
lowest moments. Last year, I was asked to nominate my family's health heroes. It was hard to pick  just two. 

The
 first I chose was  Dr Mando Watson, the wonderful consultant 
paediatrician who looked after our dear son Ivan. She never gave up on 
Ivan; she always had that desire to go the extra mile. And we will never
 forget how much she did for our family. 

My
 second nominee was Ivan's community nurse, Tara Kerr-Elliott. She did 
everything she could to get us what we needed, including a social 
worker, respite care, even a school for Ivan. Her support was remarkable
 and invaluable. We owe her and Dr Watson a great deal. 

Second, 
the awards allow us to demonstrate what our health service is really all
 about. Often it can feel like the only stories about the NHS in the 
newspapers are negative ones. But we need to show that the wrongdoing of
 a few will never detract from the everyday selflessness of the many. There
 are so many people willing to do whatever they can to help their 
patients - people such as Dr Ronan Moran, last year's Health Hero 
winner.

This
 GP visited his terminally-ill patient every evening after work, 
supporting him and the family through the toughest of times.  He was 
nominated for the award by the man's wife, who was astounded at Dr 
Moran's quiet and personal dedication to their family. 

I
 got to discuss this story, and others from his 30-year career, when I 
welcomed Dr Moran and the other Health Hero finalists to Downing Street 
last year.

Third,
 these awards give us a chance to reaffirm our commitment to the health 
service, whose budget we have been able to safeguard thanks to the tough
 decisions we've taken to rebalance our economy. 

I
 have always thought of the NHS as an expression of our values as a 
nation - a  symbol of collective will, of social solidarity.

And
 while there is today enormous pressure on the services - with an ageing
 population, an epidemic of long-term conditions and growing demand for 
new drugs and technologies - our healthcare workers have continued to 
meet the challenges with typical British resilience and resolve. 

So
 I would urge everyone to nominate their own Health Hero this year. And I
 look forward to joining the Daily Mail in celebrating more stories of 
care and compassion when the nominees and winner are announced.
