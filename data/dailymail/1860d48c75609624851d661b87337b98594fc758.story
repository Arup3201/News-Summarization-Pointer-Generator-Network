Former Chelsea midfielder Claude Makélélé is to leave his position as PSG's assistant manager in order to become the new head coach at Ligue 1 side Bastia.

Makélélé, who played for Real Madrid, Chelsea and PSG during his illustrious career could be presented as the new Bastia boss before the end of the week according to French daily paper L'Equipe.

PSG offered Makélélé a two year extension to his current deal but he turned it down in order to take up a full-time role in the hot seat.

He could be joined by former France team-mate Willy Sagnol in becoming a Ligue 1 boss with the former Bayern Munich defender close to being appointed as the new manager of Bordeaux

Makélélé, 41, was an integral part of Jose Mourinho's early success at Stamford Bridge and his cult status saw a position 'the Makélélé role' named after him.

Signed from Real Madrid in 2003 Makélélé was the crucial anchor in Mourinho's 4-3-3, allowing the likes of Frank Lampard to get further forward.

PSG won a league and Coupe de Ligue double this season under Blanc and Makélélé whilst Bastia beat the odds to achieve an impressive 10th place finish.

The reports suggest that the Corsican club have been in contact with Makélélé for over a week, as they look for a replacement for Frederic Hantz who resigned at the end of last season.
