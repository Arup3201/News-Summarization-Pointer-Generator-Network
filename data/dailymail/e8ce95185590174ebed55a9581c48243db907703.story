Schoolies celebrations may be winding down this week but it has not stopped some partying hard until the very end.

More photos of school leavers getting up to no good have hit social media, with more Victoria and New South Wales teenagers heading to their chosen party destinations - including the Gold Coast and Byron Bay - as celebrations go into their third and final week.

Though Queensland Police's official role on the Gold Coast ended on November 29, there has still been an increased officers' presence as school leavers that are of age descended.

Unlike Schoolies of the Sunshine State, those living further south are usually 18 years old and of legal drinking age.

But with this batch of party goers, there has not been a shortage of wild behaviour with photos showing people passed out, naked or half-naked, drinking excessively and messy aftermaths of celebrations.

In one picture, a young man is seen exposing himself on a balcony with his back turned and baring his buttocks.

While another larrikin is the odd one out as he poses naked with his fully clothed friends with a shirt covering his crotch.

Tamer photos show a man with just his pants on passed out on his bed halfway through texting his 'missus' on his mobile phone and a second one is seen buried up to his neck in sand on the beach.

With teenagers living through the golden age of the selfie, it seemed appropriate to a pair of grinning girls to snap a photo of themselves while their friend was throwing up into a toilet in the background.

An emerging trend with Schoolies is travelling overseas to celebrate the end of their high school careers.

One school leaver posted a photo of himself cross-dressing by donning a bikini with white-polka-dotted red bottoms and a green top in Fiji.

Other pictures that littered Instagram and Facebook were of people passing out in unusual positions or places, including one man lying down in the garden bed after he wet himself and another asleep in a trolley.

Excessive drinking normally goes hand in hand with Schoolies celebrations, with this photo showing how much one group can polish off

The official week of Schoolies celebrations for Queensland wrapped up last Saturday.

In the seven days from November 21 to November 28, 131 school leavers were arrested on a total of 152 charges, according to Queensland police media. 

At the conclusion of that week, Gold Coast District Officer Acting Chief Superintendent Des Lacy said he was overall pleased with the behaviour of the majority of this year’s Schoolies.

'While the number of schoolies attending the hub this year was up on last year the number of arrests were down,' Acting Chief Superintendent Lacy said.

'This is a clear result of effective policing strategies and a continued strong collaboration between police and a range of organisations including the event organisers, government departments, the local council, and volunteer agencies such as the Red Frogs.'

Acting Chief Superintendent Lacy said the police's focus would shift to policing licensed venues in the last two weeks of celebrations as a majority of interstate Schoolies were over 18, with an increased police presence remaining at Surfers Paradise.
