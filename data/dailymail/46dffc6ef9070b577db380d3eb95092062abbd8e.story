Southampton defender Jos Hooiveld has signed for Millwall on loan until the end of the season.

The 31-year-old is very much out of favour at St. Mary's under new boss Ronald Koeman - having yet to played a game all season for the club.

Hooiveld becomes Millwall's sixth signing of the January transfer window, following the arrivals of Paris Cowan-Hall, Dan Harding, Stefan Maierhofer, Shaun Cummings and Diego Fabbrini to the New Den.

The former Celtic centre back is eligible to make his debut for the Lions in their Championship match at home to Reading on Tuesday.

'I want as much success as possible - as many wins and as many clean sheets as we can - which is just what every footballer hopes for,' Hooiveld told Millwall's official club website after joining.

'It is very important (to be playing regularly) and I'm no different from anyone else.

'I had a very nice and positive conversation with the manager. We had a good connection.

'Every game from now on is massive. It isn't just one game that decides it - there are 20.'

Hooiveld had been due to spend the whole season on loan at Norwich, but he has not featured for the Carrow Road side since November.

The Dutchman, who made six apperances in total for the Canaries, will wear the No 5 shirt at Millwall.
