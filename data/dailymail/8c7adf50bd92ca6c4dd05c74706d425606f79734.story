She retired from the music industry with a global farewell tour six years ago.

But Nana Mouskouri is returning to the stage – to celebrate her 80th birthday.

The Greek star, who has sold more than 300million records, revealed her Happy Birthday Tour will also mark 50 years since her breakthrough working with US singer-songwriter Harry Belafonte.

The 79-year-old, pictured, said she had been serious about retiring in 2008 because she felt ‘out of touch’, but became sad during the financial crisis and wanted to bring hope and peace to her fans with a new tour – which includes dates in London, Manchester and Glasgow.

‘I was trying to find an excuse to come back for a while, so my 80th birthday was my reason,’ she told BBC Radio 4 Woman’s Hour. 

‘Now I can celebrate with the audience.’

Miss Mouskouri, who lives with second husband Andre Chapelle in Geneva, Switzerland, also said she still wears her trademark glasses because they make her feel ‘protected’.
