Brides and grooms on a budget can now have the wedding of their dreams - for just over £200.

For this bargain basement price, they'll get venue hire, decorations, audio equipment, food, gifts and invitations.

The only catch is... they'll be getting married at McDonald's.

McWedding Party packages include venue decoration, games and special gifts for bride, groom and guests

As unlikely as it might seem, demand for fast food nuptials is booming and McDonald's has expanded its wedding service programme from three to 15 branches.

'We 
started the programme because many customers tell us that McDonald's is 
where they first started dating,' a spokesperson told CNBC.

'McDonald's is where their love stories 
grew.

'This
 connection is exactly why they want to hold their wedding parties and 
even anniversary parties at McDonald's - to relive sweet beginnings and 
bring their romantic story full circle.'

The fast food giant launched its wedding party program in 2011 in response to 
customer demand, with three locations offering wedding services.

Today,
 15 McDonald's locations in Hong Kong host weddings, as well as 
engagement parties, anniversary parties and bridal showers.

Gifts and props available - depending on your budget and package - include a McDonald's white balloon wedding gown, balloon wedding hat for the groom or crystal McDonald's house.

The
 company offers four separate wedding packages,the most expensive costing £753 (HK$9,999). The cheapest party option costs £217 (HK$2,888).

The most
 deluxe version includes two-hour decorated venue rental, wedding presents, a pair of McD's balloon 
wedding rings, bridal bouquet, apple pie cake display, Crystal 
McDonald's house, decorations, an MC, supplies for 50 guests including McDonaldland character 
gifts and invites, and more.

'Thinking

anniversary or bridal shower? Think McDonald's,' says the blurb on their 
website.

groom and your guests.

When you consider that the average wedding price in Britain is more than £22,000, a McDonald's wedding begins to seem rather attractive.

But for now, McDonald's wedding parties are limited to Hong Kong locations only.
