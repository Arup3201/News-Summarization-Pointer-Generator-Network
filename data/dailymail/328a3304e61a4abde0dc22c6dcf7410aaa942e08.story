Islamic State terrorist Mohamed Elomar has taken to social media to claim his former mentor Sheik Feiz Mohammed and Islamic cleric Sheik Abu Ayman are working as spies.

Following the Hyde Park riot in 2012, Sheik Feiz described the behaviour of the former Sydney boxer and other extremists as 'unacceptable'.

It is understood that the tweets were made by an account linked to Elomar on Twitter but Sheik Ayman has refused to comment, The Daily Telegraph reports.

In his latest online tirade, the tweet claims the pair are working with the ASIO and called Sheik Ayman a 'murtad' which means a person who was born to a Muslim family who later rejects Islam.

Former Sydney resident and Islamic State terrorist Mohamed Elomar has taken to social media to rant

'Abu Ayman from Melbourne is his Amir who is Murtad and openly declares that he speaks to ASIO for the benefit of the Deen. So dies Fiez [sic],' he tweeted. 

The father of four grabbed global headlines and gained notoriety after he tweeted pictures of himself smiling as he held up two decapitated heads of Syrian soldiers.

In 2007, his father Mamdouh Elomar slammed the clerics who he believes radicalised his sons in Sydney.

Sydney's Mohamed Elomar gained notoriety after he tweeted pictures of the severed heads of Syrian soldiers

Mr Elomar told The Sun-Herald last year that he urged his children to stay away from Sheik Mohammed at the Global Islamic Youth Centre.

'Sheiks like Feiz ruin people,' Mr Elomar said.

'He is not a sheik; he is brainwashing all these children. I know my religion, so I can tell him when he is wrong, but these kids believe everything he says and think it's their religion. Someone needs to stop him.

'Today our kids are either at one extreme, partying or using drugs, or at another extreme with their religion. I don't teach my children to hate non-Muslims. I have taught them to love everyone.'

This tweet follows after a Muslim man from Melbourne who fled to the Middle East to join the fight with Islamic State threatened a terrorist attack in Australia on social media.

Chilling photographs emerged on Facebook of Suhan Rahman who was pictured with Elomar.

Rahman's family has made a desperate plea after the 23-year-old's father Lutfur Rahman alerted authorities in a bid to bring their son back home, The Daily Telegraph reports.

Mr Rahman has been told by the Australian Federal Police Counter-Terrorism Squad that they are monitoring his son's every movement overseas.

His father has been left distraught after learning his son's decision when he slipped out of the country with three other men to join the death cult in Syria.

'We hoped that he would never get into this type of thing,' his father has told the Daily Telegraph.

'Everything was OK then suddenly he just left the country.'

The 23-year-old's Facebook page was flooded with disturbing threats while police are investigating

Victoria Police are currently investigating following the threats posted on the university student's Facebook page.

'I say stuf [sic] the peaceful protests. Spill blood young aussies. Dont be humiliated especially if u cant b here in sham [sic],' Rahman posted on Thursday morning.

'Wallah theres no good left in u if none of u [sic] do something about the australian newspaper mocking our prophet pbuh. Dont be cowards. Wheres the honour whrres [sic] the courage. Let the heads fly and blood flow.'

In another post, he wrote: 'May allah accept the french brothers who terrorised france. Allahu akbar. Day by day we will bring the war home to you.'

Along with the postings on his page, Rahman also uploaded one photograph of himself wielding a high-powered silver rifle AK47.

His previous posts painted a keen young reveller at Melbourne nightclubs who enjoyed partying with his mates, rap music and fast cars but in recent months, he has taken an eerie turn.
