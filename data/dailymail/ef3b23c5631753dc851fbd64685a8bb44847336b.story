The founders of a new US clothing brand have been inundated with criticism after they called their company IRA Apparel.

The firm has been flooded with messages pointing out they share a name with the notorious Irish Republican Army, whose successors carried out bombings and attacks in Northern Ireland and Britain.

The San Francisco-based firm was even forced to issue a statement insisting it has 'no affiliation with any terror groups'.

A US-based skateboard clothing firm called IRA has been forced to issue a statement insisting they have no connection with the Irish Republican Army or its successors

The firm uses the acronym - which stands for Impact Reduction Apparel - to promote its caps and T-shirts

The tiny company was launched in September last year when it declared itself: 'The name that will change the game.'

Its main product is called the 'IRA Skullcap', a padding cushion which can be fitted inside baseball caps for the safety of skateboarders.

The company stated: 'We are scared for kids these days and have responded to the need by developing the IRA Skullcap.'

Promoters of the firm later took to skate parks in California, handing out IRA stickers for teenagers to put on their skateboards.

But, as the firm's reputation grew, it was quickly pointed out to them that the acronym they had chosen - which stands for Impact Reduction Apparel - had other connotations around the world.

And as news of the company's name spread across the Atlantic this week, the level of criticism and mockery grew to such a point that bosses had to issue a statement.

But the name caused anger on Twitter after the huge letters were emblazoned across the company's feed

After they were deluged with messages, the firm released a statement denying any connection with Ireland

It stated: 'Impact Reduction Apparel is who we are. We have no affiliation with ANY terror groups. We make products that keep skateboarders safe.'

It came after one Twitter user tweeted to the company asking: 'Any plans to sell bomber jackets?'

Another asked: 'Do you do anything in camouflage? What about berets?' and one posted: 'Surely that's only a Provisional name?'

Website user Peter Burns summed up many people's thoughts  when he wrote: 'Jaysus lads... would have been hard to google IRA before committing your brand to it?'

The company has been inundated with jokes and criticism of its choice of name

The skateboarding company is the latest to be criticised for insensitivity towards victims of terrorism in Ireland and the UK.

U.S. cocktail bars have previously been chided for serving 'Irish car bombs', drinks made by mixing Baileys, Irish whiskey and Guinness.

An IRA victim’s group, Fair, said last year: 'I would have expected Americans, of all people, to behave more sensitively and responsibly. How would they like it if we developed the Al-Qaeda car bomb, the Twin Towers cocktail or the 9/11 ice-cream sundae?'

London's Adventure Bar was also forced to apologise after it named one of its deserts 'Sundae, Bloody Sundae', a reference to when 13 people were killed in 1972.

Last year, the South Korean car manufacturer Kia announced it would not sell a model called the 'Provo' in the UK, as the name was often used to refer to the Provisional IRA during The Troubles.
