A year's worth of changes to vegetation across the world have been plotted during a fascinating animation by Nasa.

The space agency spent a year 
collecting satellite images using its Suomi National Polar-orbiting 
Partnership technology and the photos provide a vivid, at-a-glance 
depiction of the Earth's natural landscape.

They highlight the stark contrast between the plush green lands of Europe next to the dry, arid regions of Africa. The images also show how forest fires
 can physically scar the landscape in places such as Australia and how 
rivers, in dry areas such as Egypt, can replenish the land and provide a
 life source for its inhabitants.

This Herbal Earth image was captured by Nasa satellites and shows worldwide vegetation. The data was collected using the Visible-Infrared Imager/Radiometer Suite, or VIIRS technology on board the Suomi NPP satellite. VIIRS can detect changes in the reflection of light which can then be used to produce images that measure vegetation changes over time

Data was collected using the Visible-Infrared Imager/Radiometer Suite, or VIIRS technology on board the Suomi NPP satellite.

Suomi NPP, short for National 
Polar-orbiting Partnership, is a partnership between Nasa and the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

VIIRS is able to detect changes in the 
reflection of light which can then be used to produce images that 
measure vegetation changes over time.

The Suomi NPP vegetation data collected as part of the Herbal Earth project will be 
incorporated into the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, or 
NDVI, products and services.

These services include environmental 
monitoring, numerical weather prediction models and the U.S. Drought 
Monitor operated by the National Drought Mitigation Center.

The vegetation index measures and monitors plant growth, vegetation cover and biomass production from satellite information.

According to Nasa: 'High values of 
Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, or NDVI, represent dense green 
functioning vegetation and low NDVI values represent sparse green 
vegetation or vegetation under stress from limiting conditions, such as 
drought.'

The vegetation from Earth's Eastern Hempishere including Europe and Africa is pictured left, while the vegetation in the Western Hempishere is shown in the right-hand image. Areas around the Equator, especially in Africa are shown dry and arid although the green strip created by the River Nile in Egypt is visible

'NDVI represents the photosynthetic potential of vegetation.The summation or integration of NDVI over time represents gross primary production.

'High
 index values represent dense, green, functioning vegetation. Low values
 represent sparse vegetation or vegetation under stress from conditions,
 such as drought.'

Nasa
 continued: 'Although 75 per cent of the planet is a relatively 
unchanging ocean of blue, the remaining 25 per cent of Earth's surface 
is a dynamic green.

'Data from the VIIRS sensor aboard the NASA/NOAA Suomi NPP satellite is able to detect these subtle differences in greenness.

'The
 resources highlight our ever-changing planet, using highly detailed 
vegetation index data from the satellite, developed by scientists at 
NOAA.

'The darkest 
green areas are the lushest in vegetation, while the pale colors are 
sparse in vegetation cover either due to snow, drought, rock, or urban 
areas.'

Urbanised areas of northern Africa can be seen among the deserts of Egypt and beyond. This image was captured by Nasa's Suomi NPP satellite between 9 and 15 July last year. It also shows the green region around the Nile River which provides the main source of water to the region

To remove the clouds Nasa used computer programs to identify the best cloud-free measurement for every spot on the planet. Those individual measurements were then added together to form a single cloud-free mosaic of the planet.

The measurements from VIIRS continue some of the data records collected by several NASA satellites, including Terra and Aqua.

Terra
 and Aqua each make use of an instrument called the Moderate-resolution 
Imaging Spectroradiometer, or MODIS, which looks at global vegetation 
along with other Earth features.

VIIRS collects visible and infrared imagery and radiometric measurements of the land, atmosphere, cryosphere, and oceans.

A 'river of grass' extending south of Lake Okeechobee shows areas of dense man-made agriculture, urban sprawl and water conservation areas delineated by a series of waterways that crisscross Southern Florida. This image was created between 18 and 24 March this year

Its
 data is used to measure cloud and aerosol properties, ocean color, sea 
and land surface temperature, ice motion and temperature, fires, and 
Earth's albedo.

Nasa said climatologists can use VIIRS data to improve our understanding of global climate change.

The
 NPP satellite was renamed in January 2012 to Suomi NPP after Verner E. 
Suomi, a meteorologist at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison.

The
 satellite was launched from Vandenberg Air 
Force Base in California 
on 28 October 2011. It around 512 miles above the Earth.

Nasa collected the data using satellites and infra-red imaging technology that orbits 512 miles above the Earth

A computer program was used to find cloudless areas so the image wasn't obscured

The data will be used to help with environmental monitoring, predicting global changes in the weather and tracking the damage caused by drought
