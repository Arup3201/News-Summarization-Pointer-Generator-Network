A stream of good news for the economy yesterday gave hope that Britain is finally emerging from the downturn.

Figures showing that house prices had risen by almost £10,000 in a year were just one part of a wider economic recovery alongside improved orders for manufacturers and a revival on the high street.

It also emerged that new car sales surged by 12.7 per cent in July compared to a year ago, with a total of 162,228 registrations.

And the National Institute of Economic and Social Research said the economy grew by 0.7 per cent between May and July as the recovery picked up pace – double the 0.3 per cent seen in the first three months of the year.

The raft of data led to renewed optimism from economic analysts.

‘Wow,’ said Rob Wood, chief economist at investment bank Berenberg. ‘There isn’t really another way of describing the data coming out of the UK at the minute.’

And Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said it was ‘another very good news day for the UK economy’.

He added: ‘It is striking that the improved news on the UK economy is coming across a wide range of sectors, which lifts hopes that the recovery is broadening as well as deepening.’

Sales of new cars from Britain’s resurgent motor manufacturers have now risen for 17 months in a row, with Ford’s Fiesta and Focus proving the most popular.

And official figures showed total factory output jumped 1.9 per cent in June with all 13 sectors of British manufacturing – including food and drink, computers and aircraft – expanding in a single month for the first time since June 1992.

Recent rise: House prices have risen for six months in a row but average house prices to earnings are also on the rise

The latest figures reveal that house prices are 4.6 per cent higher than a year ago – and are rising at their highest rate for three years, according to the Halifax.

Months of steady rises mean the national average property price stands at £169,624, which represents a sharp rise on the £160,428 of a year ago.

However, the findings confirm recent studies from Nationwide building society and estate agents which suggested that London and the South are driving the market.

Many analysts also fear the increase is not justified in terms of what buyers can afford and the state of household finances. First-time buyers, for example, will need to take on bigger mortgages if they are to get onto the property ladder.

House prices now stand at 4.62 times average earnings, which is up from the 4.34 times in 2009 when the market hit a trough following the banking crisis.

Industry experts say two Government schemes, Funding for Lending and Help to Buy, which have cut interest rates and allow people to buy with small deposits, are largely responsible for the increases.

Martin Ellis, Halifax’s housing economist, said: ‘House prices are expected to continue to rise gradually through this year, with only modest economic growth and still falling real earnings constraining housing demand and activity.’

Property economist Matthew Pointon, of Capital Economics, argued that house prices are overvalued. ‘Evidence that house prices are in the midst of a steady recovery continues to accumulate, which is bad news for first-time buyers,’ he said.

‘That said, it is unlikely that house prices will continue to show such strong gains. Poor fundamentals will help keep a lid on demand, as will the fact that the market is still overvalued.

expected growth in manufacturing and industrial output in June pointed 
to a broad based recovery in the economy

‘There are also some signs that the supply of housing is now picking up, which should take some of the heat out of price gains.’

A report from property website Rightmove earlier this week found that six in ten people who rent their home feel ‘trapped’ because they cannot afford to buy.

Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said: ‘This will be a long, slow recovery. Much ground has been lost and transactions and lending levels are running at a fraction of what they were at the height of the housing boom.’

Alexander Gosling, director of online estate agent Housesimple.co.uk, said: ‘In many areas, prices are still way off their peak, although London remains the star performer with gravity-defying price rises thanks to the influx of foreign buyers.

'Surprisingly, we are seeing strong activity during the summer, which historically tend to be quieter.

This momentum needs to be carried through into September and October if the property market is to continue on the long road to recovery.’
