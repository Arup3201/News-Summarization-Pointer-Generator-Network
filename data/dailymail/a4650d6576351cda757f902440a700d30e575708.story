A Scottish farmer will lose a crop of 15million daffodils which bloomed early - because he can't get enough people to pull them out of the ground in time.

Mark Clark says severe winter weather which hit England in February delayed the flowers by a fortnight, while in Scotland they arrived a week early.

As a result, crops arrived at the same time north and south of the border.

Blooming nightmare: Mark Clark's daffodils arrived a week early while English crops were ready two weeks late. As they are ready at the same time, the market has been flooded with flowers

The market price will be so low that it won't be worth Grampian Growers in Montrose, Angus, pulling the flowers out of the ground.

And despite there being 234,000 people unemployed in Scotland, Mr Clark has struggled to recruit pickers locally because they don't want to do the back-breaking work.

There are currently 100 pickers working at the farm - but Mr Clark needs closer to 500 to bring the crop in.

Despite placing adverts in local newspapers and in job centres he has not found enough workers.

He is set to lose £300,000 because the daffodils cannot be picked in time.

Warm weather in Scotland meant the crop was ready for picking one week earlier than expected.

Mr Clark said: 'We’ve lost about 25 per cent of our volume because of the weather. That’s 1.5 million of our bunches, each containing 10 blooms, completely wiped out.

'Every single day that we don’t have enough pickers helping out, we are losing 150,000 to 200,000 bunches.

'It looks like it’s going to cost us just over £300,000, which is absolutely devastating.

'We were looking for a cold week last week, so that the growth of our daffodils will halt, but it just never happened.

'Instead we had really mild weather last week which has continued from November, December time.

'When you look back at the whole winter we’ve not even had one spell of particularly cold weather.'

He added that the weather had conspired to bring the Scottish and English picking seasons together.

With all the flowers coming at once, the market has been saturated and the price has tumbled.

He added: 'Even when we finally get some pickers we’re going to lose money, the market value will be so low.

'Our main competitors for growing 
daffodils are down in Lincolnshire and Cornwall. Down there they had 
that very cold weather front from Serbia in early February.

'Lincolnshire even reached -15, -16 
degrees which put their crops on hold for two weeks. This has meant that
it’s brought our picking seasons together.

'Even if the market wasn’t flooded we 
don’t have any pickers anyway, because they’re all still down in 
Cornwall and Lincolnshire.

'We are probably ten days earlier than
what we normally would be. We started picking on March 2 when on 
average we start on March 12. Normally, the English production would be 
much further on at that time.'

Frustration: Mark Clark is still waiting for travelling teams of pickers to arrive in Scotland to pick his crop
