A Ukip victory in Thursday's crunch Rochester by-election will spark 'instability and insecurity', David Cameron has warned.

The Prime Minister issued the stark warning during a final visit to the Kent constituency today, which looks set to return former Tory Mark Reckless as Ukip's second elected MP.

Mr Cameron also refused to deny house prices in the town could tumble if Mr Reckless triumphs for Ukip following 'desperate' warnings from Tory backbench MPs.

Mr Cameron spoke to Mick Parks, Workshop Foreman at MCL Mechanical, during his fifth and final visit to the Rochester and Strood constituency ahead of the forthcoming by-election later this week

The PM said: 'I'm not a forecaster of house prices but I do know this: The choice at this by-election is between whether to vote for Kelly Tolhurst - a strong, local candidate who backs our economic plan - or to vote Ukip, where you've got instability, insecurity and the danger of Ed Miliband being a step nearer Downing Street.'

His remarks came after Charles Walker, the MP for Broxbourne, said on the campaign trail yesterday: 'The danger is if you vote Ukip, the value of your house will go down.'

Mr Reckless is odds-on favourite to retain the Rochester and Strood seat he won as a Conservative in 2010 before defecting to the Eurosceptic party and stepping down to force Thursday's contest.

The Tories have all but abandoned hope of victory despite Mr Cameron spearheading a massive push to avoid a repeat of the result in Clacton, where defector Douglas Carswell won for Ukip by a large majority.

Mr Cameron's visit to the town today is his fifth and final visit ahead of Thursday's contest.

A Ukip victory has raised the spectre of further Tory backbenchers transferring their allegiance to Nigel Farage's outfit but the Prime Minister declined to speculate on the implications for a second bruising reverse.

Mr Cameron said: 'Between now and Thursday what I'm going to do is focus on this by-election.

'I want the people in Rochester and Strood to have the best possible choice: Kelly Tolhurst, a strong local candidate, living here, working here, born here, raised here, the community absolutely at her heart.

'That's what I'm going to be focusing on. Then let's see what the result is on Thursday and take it from there.'

Asked if he was satisfied enough of an effort had been mounted to try to keep hold of the seat, he said: 'I think Kelly has fought a very strong local campaign ... and she has been very strongly backed by the Conservative Party - by Cabinet ministers, ministers - and I think it's absolutely right to do that.

'I believe in leading from the front so I have been keen to come down here five times and to play my part in the campaign. It's the right thing to do. '

He said: 'The only poll that counts, as they say, is the one on polling day. It's quite clear this is a two horse race.'

The scale of Mr Cameron's task was underlined by the fact that the boss of the firm he was visiting admitted he had been wavering over whether to end his long history of voting for the Conservatives on Thursday.

While he was not prepared to back Ukip yet as their policies were 'not strong enough for me' - Bill Buckley suggested it remained a possibility 'later on down the line' once they had been more tested.

'They've certainly got the public imagination,' the director of MCL Ltd told reporters - citing the issues of immigration and Europe - after showing the PM the heating and ventilation control units being made at the small factory in Upper Halling.

He was dismissive of Mr Farage's beer-swilling image, saying he needed to 'turn that down a bit' if he wanted to broaden his appeal, adding:

'Do you want someone like that running the country?'

But he was also critical of all politicians, saying he didn't 'really support any of them' and suggesting 'the whole lot need their heads banging together'.

Asked if he was considering switching his vote to Labour, he said: 'To be honest with you I would consider voting for whoever I thought was best for the country.

'I should imagine it will be Conservative if I'm honest.'

He said he had been encouraged by what he heard from Mr Cameron about action to force banks to lend, complaining that the refusal of the bank he had used for more than 30 years to provide funds when the firm was hit by the recession and had to shed several posts had seriously delayed its resurgence.
