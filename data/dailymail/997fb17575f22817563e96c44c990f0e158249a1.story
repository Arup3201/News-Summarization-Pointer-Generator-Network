Fiorentina head coach Vincenzo Montella is confident sought-after winger Juan Cuadrado will remain with the Serie A club this season.

The Colombia international, who is catching the eye of Manchester United and Barcelona, was left out of Fiorentina's squad for Sunday's 2-1 friendly triumph over Real Madrid in Warsaw, increasing speculation he is set to leave.

However, Montella believes that despite the 26-year-old being strongly linked with a move away from Florence since May, he will stay put.

'I have never thought of losing Juan,' Montella told La Nazione. 'He's been here in the past, he is here now and he will be here in the future.

'I don't think about how his (Cuadrado's) story might finish.

'A player like him can play in every position in midfield.'

Cuadrado scored 15 goals in 43 appearances in all competitions for Fiorentina last season and is under contract at the Stadio Artemio Franchi until June 2017.

United manager Louis van Gaal hopes to add new faces before the transfer window shuts after starting the season with a home defeat by Swansea.
