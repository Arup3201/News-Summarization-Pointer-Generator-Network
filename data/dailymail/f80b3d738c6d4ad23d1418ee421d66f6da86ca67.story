When builders digging up Stephen and Nicky West’s patio for an extension came to the back door clutching a human skull, the couple were understandably alarmed.

But fear turned to fascination after experts said four bodies unearthed by the workmen came from a burial site dating back as much as 1,400 years to the middle Saxon period.

Archaeologists believe the skeletons may have been there since 650AD and are part of a much larger burial ground under the home in the Warwickshire village of Ratley.

Ancient skeletons of four people were unearthed during extension works at  the Rately home, Warks,  of Stephen (pictured) and Nicky West. The 1,400-year-old remains are part of an Anglo Saxon burial ground

They say the remains of two women, a man and a child aged between ten and 12 provide an insight into an obscure period.

Analysis of the bones shows that the 
population at the time suffered from periods of malnourishment and would
have been in near-constant pain because of infections. Mr West, 55, 
said: ‘It was a bit of a shock to find out I’ve been living above an 
ancient burial site all these years.

‘It’s a privilege to be so close to 
such amazing history – and as long as they don’t wake me up, I’m quite 
happy for it to stay that way.’

Radiocarbon dating has revealed the bones date back to between 650AD and 820AD

The bones were taken away first to Gloucester University and then to York University for testing by expert archaeologists

He added: ‘We had builders in as we 
were extending the back of our house, and I heard one of them knock on 
the door.

'I was absolutely amazed when I saw a workman standing holding a
skull – he just said “I think there’s something you should see”.

‘I was praying that the bodies were really old and we hadn’t stumbled across something more grisly.

‘But the archaeologists came over 
within a couple of hours and said it was quite likely there were a lot 
more bodies under the house.’

Mr West said he had joked at the start
of the building work that they might find something from the English 
Civil War because their house is near the site of the battle of 
Edgehill, where the army of Charles I clashed with Parliamentarians in 
1642.

But the remarkable archaeological find pre-dates that by nearly 
1,000 years.

Carbon-dating from two of the skeletons showed that they died between 650 and 820 AD.

England was then divided into a number
of kingdoms and the area may have been a frontier in another war 
between the Saxon kingdom of the Hwicce and the eventually dominant 
Anglian kingdom of Mercia.

Stuart Palmer, of Archaeology 
Warwickshire, said: ‘The discovery of this previously unsuspected burial
ground is an extremely rare and important addition to what has 
previously been an archaeologically invisible period of Warwickshire’s 
history.’

Mr West, who runs an online bird feed company, said further digs may be limited.

‘We’re interested to know what’s down 
there, but to be honest we’d like to keep the bit of the house we live 
in standing where it is, so we won’t be searching too hard.’

The early Anglo-Saxons founded much of
England as we know it, including developing systems of justice and 
currency.

They ruled England through the upheavals of the Viking age 
right up to the Norman conquest of 1066.

Archaeologists have identified the remains of at least four bodies which included two adult females, a young male and a juvenile aged between 10 and 12

Mr West (pictured outside his home) says the find is 'spine-tingling' to think he's been sleeping on top of such history
