A man who attacked his pregnant girlfriend and tried to push her over a banister when he 'saw red' escaped jail after the court heard how he struggled to cope with stressful situations.

Edward Gaunt, 20, slapped Sarah Bolland, held a knife to her stomach and threatened to harm her unborn child during a series of rows last December.

But despite labelling his crimes 'appalling', a judge handed Gaunt a suspended sentence, allowing him to walk free from court.

No longer together: Edward Gaunt attacked his then girlfriend Sarah Bolland when she was pregnant

The
most vicious of his assaults was sparked when his girlfriend demanded 
to know if Gaunt had been taking drugs, and looked at his arms for 
needle marks, a hearing at Chesterfield Magistrates' Court was told.

The court heard how Gaunt had been in a five-year 'on-off' relationship with Miss Bolland, which had featured some violent episodes.

Sarah Haslam, prosecuting, said Gaunt seemed happy about his partner's pregnancy until the night of December 27 last year, when he 'saw red' and attacked her.

Gaunt, 20, struck both sides of her head with his hand and pulled her to the floor.  He then tried to push her over a banister rail and spat at her as she walked downstairs.

Mrs Haslam said trouble flared again at 10am the next day after Ms Bolland asked if he was using amphetamine. The court heard she looked for needle marks on his arm and he became angry.

Mrs Haslam said: 'He hit her around the head many times and he grabbed her throat. He knelt on her stomach and slapped her across the face.

The judge told Gaunt, pictured left, that he had behaved in a 'vicious and malicious' way towards Miss Bolland

'He pushed a sharp knife against her stomach, saying he would put it through her and her baby.'

She added: 'He said: "I hope you will ring me later and give me some good news that the baby has died".'

Gaunt, from Buxton, Derbyshire, was arrested and claimed that Ms Bolland was 'spiteful and hormonal' and that she had made up the allegations.

He appeared in court in custody, having been on remand in Nottingham prison for 24 days, and admitted the assaults at Buxton.

'It was appalling treatment of someone carrying your child. It beggars belief,' Deputy District Judge Andrew Davison told him.

He said Gaunt had behaved in a 'vicious and malicious' way and had been wrongly charged with common assault when he should have faced the more serious offence of assault causing actual bodily harm.

Mr Davison imposed a 20-week jail term but suspended it for two years. He ordered Gaunt to pay £500 compensation to Ms Bolland, who suffered bruising to her head.

A restraining order, banning Gaunt from contacting her for an indefinite period, was also imposed, plus a two-year probation supervision order, including drug treatment and domestic abuse programmes.

Defending, Rebecca Wrack said: 'He deeply regrets his behaviour and doesn't seek to excuse it. The relationship has now come to an end and she has moved out of the area.'

She told the court a friend of Gaunt had died a week before the offence.

He struggled to cope with stressful situations and he took amphetamine and reacted badly when confronted about it.
