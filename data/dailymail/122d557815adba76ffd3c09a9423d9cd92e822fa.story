This tangled mass of fur may resemble some sort of monster  but it is in fact a dog that was neglected for a year after his master died and the new owners refused to care for him.

The faithful pet was given food and water, and allowed access to the balcony so he didn't make a mess inside the house, but was otherwise left uncared for.

When animal workers were finally called they found him covered in a mass of hair, encrusted with faeces and soaked in urine, which was so heavy it meant he could barely move or breathe. 

Neglect: This bobtail dog was left in an apartment in Russia for a year with just enough food and water to survive but his owners otherwise refused to care for him

Out from under: It took six workers more than three hours to remove the matted coat of fur from the animal after they were called to get rid of him

Abuse: The animal was covered in hair which was encrusted with faeces, soaked in urine and so heavy he could barely breathe

Russian pensioner Gore Zhdanov, 79, owned the dog until he passed away in the city of Novosibirsk 12 months ago, leaving all of his possessions, including the bobtail dog, to his relatives.

But there were disputes over how to divide the inheritance, and while the arguments raged it was decided to keep the dog in the flat to help guard the valuables.

The new family did just enough to keep the dog alive, but otherwise refused to care for him. 

The abuse went on for months until they came to an agreement to sell the home and the pet, and when animal workers went to collect the pet, this is the shocking sight they were greeted with. 

Disgrace: The faithful pet had been owned by Russian pensioner Gore Zhdanov, but passed to his relatives along with his flat after he died aged 79

Dispute: The new owners began arguing over the inheritance and so left the dog in the flat for a year with only food and water. This is the sight that greeted animal workers when they were called to remove him

Beyond belief: While this may resemble a hairy monster or a huge piece of pocket fluff it is in fact a dog who was neglected for more than a year 

The canine was covered in a mass of stinking hair which had faeces and urine soaked into it, which was almost too heavy for him to move or breathe. 

It took six workers three hours to remove all of the fur and expose the animal underneath, who was covered with abscesses and sores.

Despite the terrifying neglect the bobtail is expected to recover. The callous previous owners were so neglectful they did not even know the pet's name, so rescuers renamed him Cocos.

Dog worker Vitaly Kornilova said: 'He could barely walk, and was in a pitiful state. Relatives called us to take him away because they decided they wanted to sell the flat now that the inheritance paperwork been completed.

On the mend: The previous owners did not even know the animal's name, so rescuers renamed him Cococs. He is now expected to make a full recovery

Back to health: A local expert in bobtail dogs is now looking after Cocos and is feeding him a special diet of vitamins in order to aid his recovery

Whole new dog: Cocos relaxes in his new home after having several pounds of hair removed after he was left alone for a year without being groomed

'They said they had kept the dog to guard the flat against vandals but now wanted to get rid of it.

'Six people spent three hours trimming Cocos fur, filling four 100 liter bags with dog hair. After that, Cocos' teeth were thoroughly cleaned.'

Cocos now lives with Elena Rivvo, a local expert in bobtails, who has put him on a special diet of vitamins in order to help him back to full strength.

Lease of life: Cocos goes for a walk with new owner Elena Rivvo, an expert in bobtails who took him in
