Federal investigators are looking into possible connections between today's bomb attack on the Boston Marathon and the Patriot's Day anniversaries of the Branch Davidian compound seige in Waco, Texas, and the Oklahoma City bombing, a Justice Department source tells MailOnline.

Today's attack took place on Patriots' Day, which marks the first battle of the Revolutionary War and the 'shot heard 'round the world.' It is a day held in reverence by right-wing domestic groups and others who oppose the federal government.

President Barack Obama himself acknowledged the significance of the holiday during his briefing this afternoon.

'Today is Patriots Day,' he said. 'A day that reflects the freedom Boston has celebrated throughout its history.'

Rallying point: The April 19, 1993 federal siege of the Branch Davidian Cult became a rallying cry for right-wing anti-government groups

The 1995 bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building, which killed 168, occurred the day after Patriots' Day. Bomber Timothy McVeigh was said believe the date was significant.

The federal siege of the Branch Dravidian compound, which left 82 members of the cult dead, began on Patriots' Day in 1993.

Today is also Tax Day, when federal income tax returns are due. In recent years, it has been seized on by members of the Tea Party as cause to protest federal government policies and tax rates.

A Justice Department source tells MailOnline that authorities are looking into the possibility that the Boston attack, which killed two and injured 86 more at the finish line of the Boston Marathon, could have been planned to coincide with Patriots' Day.

Patriots' Day marks the April 19, 1776 Battles of Lexington and Concord in Massachusetts.

Since 1969, residents of Massachusetts and Maine have celebrated Patriots' Day on the third Monday in April.

The Boston Marathon has been scheduled on Patriots' Day since it began in 1897.

The Oklahoma City federal building bombing took place on April 19, 1995.

The federal siege in Waco began on the same date two years earlier.

Right-wing groups that oppose the federal government have cited the Waco siege as an example of federal authorities over-stepping their power.

The Virginia Tech massacre, the deadliest school shooting in U.S. history, took place on April 16, 2007.
