Up to 1,000 patients die in NHS hospitals every month because of avoidable blunders, Jeremy Hunt warned today.

The Health Secretary has ordered an annual review of 'avoidable deaths', which he described as the 'biggest scandal in global healthcare'.

The yearly study of about 2,000 patient case notes will see England become the first country in the world to monitor the extent of avoidable deaths, in the hope of cutting the rate. 

Jeremy Hunt has ordered a review of patient case notes to establish how many cases are avoidable

Mr Hunt told the Sunday Telegraph how the latest reforms to improve the safety record in healthcare will be the 'most profound change' during his time in charge.

'It is about changing behaviour and the way everyone works in the NHS,' he said.

The Health Secretary the NHS must learn from other industries where safety failures are not tolerated.

'In the 1970s there were about 2,000 deaths a year from airline crashes, and the industry realised that they would go out of business if people became too scared to fly,' he said.

'Now the global figure is around 500, even though there is nine times as much air travel.' 

The health service had to act to stamp out avoidable deaths: 'This is the biggest scandal in global healthcare. Why hasn't the health service adopted the kinds of standards we now take for granted in the airline and nuclear industry?' 

This week a report on the treatment of NHS staff who tried to air their care concerns will be published by Sir Robert Francis, who led the a damning report into the Mid Staffs Hospital scandal which found that at least 1,200 patients died because of poor care at the hospital.

Mr Hunt promised more protection for whistleblowers to encourage them to speak out about power standards of care.

'On high death rates, failing hospitals and whistleblowing, we are calling time on the cover-up culture and ushering in a new era of transparency,' Mr Hunt said.

Doctors and nurses will be given training in whistleblowing from this autumn so they know how to raise the alarm about care.

Helene Donnelly, an A&E nurse whose warnings were ignored at Mid Staffs, will advise junior clinical staff on how to expose wrongdoing.

A report by healthcare analysts Dr Foster published today has found a 'significant reduction' in the overall death rate in 11 NHS trusts that were put into special measures, which have been credited for saving hundreds of lives.

The Health Secretary said the NHS had to learn from other industries which had refused to tolerate avoidable deaths

A spokeswoman for the Department of Health said under the annual review announced by Mr Hunt hospitals will be placed into bands depending on the number deaths estimated locally.

'By March 2016, every hospital board will have the first of an annual series of projected avoidable mortality rates to inform and drive local improvement,' she said.

'The Health Secretary will require every hospital chairman to write to him upon receipt of their figures each year to update him on how they plan to eradicate avoidable deaths in their organisation.'

Mr Hunt said: 'I'm determined to go even further in rooting out poor care, and have ordered a national case-note review to work out the percentage of avoidable deaths by hospital.

'I want all hospital boards to have a laser-like focus on eradicating avoidable deaths in their organisation; even one life lost to poor care or safety error is too many.'

Hospital mortality rates expert, Professor Nick Black said the review would 'provide a basis for stimulating quality improvement in each individual hospital'.
