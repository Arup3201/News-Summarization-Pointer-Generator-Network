England coach Stuart Lancaster has chosen to suppress a patriotic video shown to his players for fear of it upsetting Scottish nationalists

The England rugby team will not release a patriotic video used to inspire its players because head coach Stuart Lancaster fears it will upset the Scots.

The emotionally-charged video, which brought some of England's toughest sportsmen to tears when they watched it, will not be released to the public because of 'political ramifications' from Scottish nationalists.

Lancaster said he was concerned that the video could prompt claims of 'arrogance' from other Home Nations sides before they meet in the Six Nations tournaments early next year.

The team's coach said the video, which features English rugby legends such as Peter Winterbottom and Bill Beaumont, would help motivate the players before the World Cup, which takes place in England next year.

But England will face Scotland in February in the Six Nations, and there are fears that the video's release could provoke anger among nationalists in the wake of last month's independence referendum. 

The Sunday Telegraph reported that Lancaster, speaking at a business conference in Leeds on Thursday, said: 'If you start talking about Englishness you are soon seen as arrogant. We have to make sure we have our feet firmly on the ground and show we are not an arrogant team.

'I am hesitant to put the video out there because of the political ramifications. It articulates really well … English identity and some of the good aspects of being English. I think it will be really powerful in the lead-up to the World Cup.'

His view was backed up by Welsh Conservative MP Glyn Davies, who said: 'We are living in an era where people are outraged by the oddest things. 

'I haven’t seen the film but rugby teams have just got to be sensitive. Everybody has got to be careful because very often the message backfires. Stuart Lancaster has got to think about his team.'

Lancaster has been trying to boost national affection in the lead-up to next year's World Cup.

He said he admired the way the Welsh team play for a 'cause', which the whole nation rallies around.

The England team, pictured celebrating after Luther Burrell's (second from right) try against Scotland in this year's Six Nations, were shown the inspirational video, with some even shedding a tear

Lancaster is hoping the patriotic video will help replicate England's success at the 2003 World Cup, which was won after this last-gasp drop goal by Jonny Wilkinson

He hopes the team can improve from England's disastrous 2011 World Cup, hosted by New Zealand, which was tarnished by a series of incidents of ill-discipline.

Four players, including captain Mike Tindall - who is married to Zara Phillips - were pictured on a night out in Queenstown just hours after a narrow 13-9 victory over Argentina.

Martin Johnson, England's coach at the time, also reprimanded three players for inappropriate comments made to a female worker at the team hotel.

The day after being knocked out by France in the quarter finals, England centre Manu Tuilagi was fined after jumping off a ferry in Auckland. 

A spokesman for the Rugby Football Union said: 'Several motivational videos have been used for the players over the last couple years including one which talks about the history and heritage of the shirt. 

'There are no plans for any to be released publicly because it was made for the players and something we want to keep it for the squad.'
