You can only go so far on an American freeway before signs start popping up, advertising the nearest McDonald's, Taco Bell or KFC restaurant. But according to a new survey, Americans find the fare at the huge chains disgusting.

The new study by Consumer Reports finds that Americans are eating more fast-food than ever, spending $680billion a year, but have lately developed a taste for restaurants with higher-quality ingredients.

More than 96,000 of the magazine's 
readers were queried about which fast-food chains they liked the most, 
and they found 21 other burgers more palatable than McDonald's Big Mac.

Not loving it: In a new survey conducted by Consumer Reports, Americans ranked McDonald's Taco Bell and Subway as some of the worst fast-food restaurants

Americans appear to be shifting their fast-food 
preferences toward fast-casual restaurants that serve higher quality 
ingredients. Chipotle was rated the top place for burritos, over the 
likes of Taco Bell

The participants reported eating at a combined 65 different chains, and ranked each restaurant they tried on a scale of 1 (least delicious) to 10 (most delicious you've ever eaten).

The results are then broken down by food category, ranking the best burger joints, taco shops, chicken restaurants and sandwich makers. 

The 2014 results show a shift in American fast-food preference, with diners placing a new importance on quality over convenience compared to the 2011 report.

'Fast-casual dining in places like Chipotle and Panda Express lets the consumer guide the staff to prepare their meal just the way they like it, Darren Tristano, executive vice president of Technomic, a food-service research and consulting firm, told the magazine.

Chains like Noodles & Company and Panera, which serve meat produced without antibiotics, also ranked higher on the lists.

This change in eating habits may be influenced by the millennial generation, the magazine says, who are eating at cheap fast-casual restaurants in order to dine out more often.
