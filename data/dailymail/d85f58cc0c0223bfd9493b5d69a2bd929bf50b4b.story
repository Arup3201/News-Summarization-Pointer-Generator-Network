The backlash continues against FA chairman Greg Dyke’s proposal to allow B-teams from big clubs into the lower reaches of the football pyramid.

Erik Samuelson, chief executive of AFC Wimbledon, claims Dyke’s idea, revealed on Thursday, will wreck the Football League.

He also reminded the Football Association of their duty of care to football at all levels, not only the elite at England and in the Barclays Premier League.

Controversial: Grey Dyke's B-team proposal has been criticised from all angles

'The idea of a B-team league is abysmal,' said Samuelson. 'I don’t think it could ever work and while we have to be cautious I don’t think that’s really the issue. I think this is an idea floated out there when the underlying objective is to create feeder clubs, either directly by takeover of another club of by an extension of the loan system and the significant partnerships.

'For me, it would wreck the Football League. This is a problem the Premier League has. They don’t want to take the risk of blooding youngsters in a league where the cost of failure is enormous and their solution is to reorganise the Football League for their own benefit.

'It is unfortunate that it is the FA which has put this forward because the FA has a job to nourish and protect all of football across England and this comprehensively fails to do that. In fact it will damage it.'

AFC Wimbledon was a club created amid 
blundering FA directives of the past, when Wimbledon were allowed to 
leave south-west London and move to Milton Keynes, where they became MK 
Dons.

Fourth tier: AFC Wimbledon finished mid-table in League Two this season

AFC was founded in 2002 to replace the lost team. They started in the ninth tier of English football and are now in League Two.

'Football clubs are rooted in their own communities,' said Samuelson. 'People support them and they grow up around them, more so for ours than most but for more or less all clubs. And we can become Premier League team B. Where’s the concern for football fans and the links to the communities? Where’s the respect for a football pyramid that’s hugely successful?'

Any shift towards feeder clubs 
threatens to eat away at the independence of many smaller clubs and the 
angry reaction should come as no surprise to Dyke.

'Greg
 Dyke held a meeting with League One and Two clubs at St George’s Park 
earlier this year to discuss this sort of thing and he was left in no 
doubt how we felt about it,' said Samuelson. 'It is important for us all
 that we have a successful England team but the solution is in the hands
 of the Premier League.'

Wrecking ball: Samuelson believes that Dyke's proposal will damage the Football League

As the elected representatives of the custodians and owners of Wimbledon's Football Club, the Dons Trust board were dismayed to read the report of FA Chairman Greg Dyke's England Commission. These plans appear to be seriously entertaining the idea of parachuting a new tier of league football into the existing pyramid – including B teams of Premier League clubs that consider themselves overburdened with young players who aren't playing enough games.

We suspect that no clubs' fans have seen their team play at as many levels of the game in as short a time as Wimbledon fans. From leaving the Premiership at the Dell in June 2000 to re-joining the Football League in 2011 via the Combined Counties League, the Isthmian League and the Conference, Wimbledon have played in every tier from first to ninth of the league pyramid except League One in this century.

One of the reasons that Wimbledon fans received so much solidarity from fans of other clubs when our league place was awarded to Milton Keynes by a three-man commission in 2002 was because it so crudely compromised the integrity of the league pyramid structure. Until 2002 no town or club had been awarded a league place off the pitch, every promotion had been won on the merits of what a club's players achieved.

Throughout our journey to reclaim our league place, Dons Trust board members met supporters, chairmen, committee men and women and owners at over a hundred non-league clubs. Despite the controversial circumstances of our rebirth, we and other Wimbledon supporters very much enjoyed this journey. We met many amazing people who have dedicated much of their lives to sustaining football clubs in their communities.

In 2002 the FA Commission that awarded Wimbledon FC's league place to Milton Keynes actually told Wimbledon fans not to bother restarting, telling us it would not be "in the wider interests of football." We proved them wrong many times over. But this proposal to abolish the very founding tenets of the English league structure on a vague promise it might improve the fortunes of the national team is most certainly not in the wider interests of football. It lazily cherry picks elements from other countries' systems that just so happen to serve the narrow interests of an elite group of largely Premier League clubs.

The FA has a responsibility to represent and protect its members at all levels of the game. This proposal has been dreamed up without any serious engagement with supporters or even with the Football Conference. Our representative organisations - Supporters Direct and The Football Supporters Federation - were not spoken to or invited to discuss the issues with the commission. This arrogant approach has rightly angered many thousands of football supporters. This proposal as it currently stands is an insult to each and every single club below Championship level and to the hundreds of thousands of fans around the country who watch their local teams across the season.

The FA abdicated its responsibilities in 2002 when it sanctioned the franchising of a single club to Milton Keynes. If it pushes ahead with this proposal it will have abdicated its responsibilities to all its members, bar the largest Premier League clubs. The B team proposal is entirely without merit. While we have concerns about other parts of the report – the Strategic Loan Partnerships look to us like feeder clubs by the back door – we believe that the B team proposal brings the entire report into disrepute. We will be happy to engage in a genuine consultation once the report has been withdrawn.
