Roy Keane was back on our screens on Tuesday night, delivering the kind of frank appraisals he won admiration for during his initial stint as an ITV pundit.

His straight-forward assessments were that: this current Chelsea side cannot be considered great until they win trophies; John Terry should have been on the front foot for Edinson Cavani’s goal; and Jose Mourinho’s defenders struggled to deal with simple crosses from Paris Saint-Germain all evening.

No spectacular insight, and hardly cause to cower behind the sofa, but it is clear his natural demand for excellence remains an underlying constant, two and a half months after his sudden departure from Aston Villa.

Tim Sherwood, whose tongue can deliver similar sharp critique, might decide that chapter worth studying as he plans his own manual for guiding Villa to safety.

Keane left Villa after clashes with senior players, mainly over training intensity and his high standards towards performance. While some in the squad liked his style, his words overall carried too much venom to prove successful.

Ills cannot always be cured by a deluge of bitter medicine. Sometimes the pills must be palatable.

Premier League professionals should be capable of engaging in robust discussions on football matters, and any Villa player who feels beyond criticism this season needs to take one look at the table.

But when a group is low on confidence a mix of tactics might require employment. This is the subtlety of management. It is why Sir Alex Ferguson occasionally switched off his hairdryer.

It is in this context that it is worth visiting Sherwood’s answer from his Monday press conference to a question about his honesty in regards to player appraisals.

‘One thing I can guarantee if I'm going to be guilty of something it will be honesty,’ he readily agreed before adding a caveat.

‘If they do well they will be told, if they don't do well they will also be told and told why. You have to be constructive.

‘It can't be because of a referee's decision or if someone scores a 40-yarder that everyone's c***. That ain’t the case.

‘You have to talk to them. Some people might have played well and need to be patted on the back. Some people need a kick up the backside at the right time and I need to be that person to be able to do that.’

Sherwood famously called out his Spurs players for lacking guts and character after a 4-0 defeat to Chelsea, a public dressing down viewed in quarters as too far. ‘Watch this space!’ he grinned when asked if he would use similar language at Villa. You hope, for his and the club’s sake, he does not need to go there.

A deeper guide of his mentality presented itself when probed about the merits of all players in his squad. He voluntarily brought up his relationship with Brazilian midfielder Sandro, who saw his game time limited following that humbling at Stamford Bridge. Discordant, is one way to describe their dynamic.

‘Everyone has got an important part to play,’ said Sherwood of Villa. ‘There won’t be anyone who is not included in my plans. It’s a fresh start for everyone.

‘Whether the previous manager liked them or he didn’t, it doesn’t matter to me. They need to prove themselves on the training field. I need to see them train well and see what they produce.

'It’s a jigsaw you put together when you pick a team and you look at the opposition. You have to leave out a lot of players doing that but that doesn’t mean they’re finished. You might leave them out for two weeks and they start getting a bit disgruntled but it doesn’t mean they’re finished.

‘You can bring them back because there might be that time at the end of the season when they need to come back in and do a job. Sandro was a good example of that at Spurs against Aston Villa, the last game of last season. Everyone down south was talking about how I had a big fall out with him.

‘I never burnt any bridges with any players. Never. There was always a chance that I would bring him back and put him in the team and I brought him back for that game because I was worried about the counter attacking threat of (Gabby) Agbonlahor.

‘I pushed the full backs on and played Sandro in the pivot role and he did the job for me and got a standing ovation coming off after 60 minutes.

‘You don’t burn bridges with players. You can’t afford to do that. They’re paid a lot of money by the football club and it’s an asset you’re pouring down the drain.’

Sherwood spent Monday evening watching Villa’s Under-21 side lose 3-0 to Derby at the Pirelli Stadium. Jack Grealish, Charles N’Zogbia and Matt Lowton were among those featuring in a disjointed performance that suggested individual efforts were being made to impress the new boss.

As an exercise in assessing his assets, Sherwood may have left underwhelmed.

From this point he needs to work out how much he should ruffle feathers, how often to offer a coaxing pat.

Whatever his call, whether burning bridges or building bridges, the only bridge of concern to Villa is the one connecting them to Premier League football for the 2015-16 season.

On that basis, Keane provides an interesting signpost.
