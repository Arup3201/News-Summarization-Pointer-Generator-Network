Just when you thought it time for a period of reflection on this wonderful golfing season comes one last storyline not only intriguing in its own right but with repercussions for 2015.

In Isleworth, Florida this week — yes, the place where he used to reside and where he smashed into a fire hydrant five years ago, causing his life to change irrevocably — we will witness the latest comeback of Tiger Woods.

Tiger Woods makes his comeback and could offer clues as to his future at the highest level in Orlando

 

Past comebacks have included one from injury in 2009 and one at the Masters in 2010, when the scandalous revelations that followed his hydrant prang the previous Thanksgiving had finally died down.

Back then, given the nature of the man and the fact he was relatively young, you felt sure he would find his way back to the summit, and sure enough he did. But this one has a far more uncertain feel about it.

When last seen, the poor soul could barely hit a shot without yelping in agony. At the Bridgestone Invitational in August, the greatest athlete the game has seen climbed into his courtesy car with all the agility of a man in his eighties. The following week, we had the bleak pantomime of a limp-laden appearance at the PGA Championship before, thankfully, he took himself off to try to restore an acceptable modicum of fitness and health.

And now, a few days shy of his 39th birthday, he’s back.  

Even if he is fit enough, will Woods be able to compete against the likes of Rory McIlroy?

Two huge questions will dominate the landscape at the World Challenge event Tiger usually hosts in California but which has moved to the Sunshine State this year. 

Will he ever be fit enough to play again on a regular basis at the highest level? And, even if he is fit enough, will he be able to compete against the likes of Rory McIlroy, who will be striping the ball comfortably 40 yards past him off the tee?

Neither question will be fully answered in Orlando, of course, but there will be plenty of fascinating clues. For starters, how will he swing the club under the tutelage of new coach Chris Como, whose specialist area is injury prevention?

During this lost year, Woods has watched McIlroy fulfil all his awesome potential. He’s seen American golf begin the painful process of moving on and invest faith in the likes of Rickie Fowler and the impressive Jordan Spieth.

Does Tiger have any relevance to this ongoing narrative, outside the usual amount of interest that will always be centred upon an athlete who has achieved so much? At Isleworth this week, let’s hope for one or two positive signs.

Given the ages of the two men, wouldn’t it be truly sad if we never got to witness at least one authentic Tiger versus Rory shootout?

When the pair got together for a late-night American television appearance last August, amid plenty of playful banter, Woods looked McIlroy in the eye at one point and said: ‘I’m not going to let you win a green jacket next year.’

Fingers crossed, against the likes of Graeme McDowell and current Masters champion Bubba Watson this week, Woods shows enough to suggest that, by the time McIlroy’s first tilt at a career grand slam rolls around next April, he can ignite a contest for the ages.

Ryder Cup reflection is great for Christmas

Given it’s only been two months since Jamie Donaldson claimed the winning point at the Ryder Cup, you might be suspicious of any film or book detailing the ‘Glory of Gleneagles’ as being rushed out for the Christmas market.

Happily, the official film that runs over two DVDs and a book proclaiming to be the ‘inside story’ are worthy testimonies to the events over that marvellous long weekend. 

The DVD (Lace, £15) not only brings all the main highlights but is filled with extras, including an excellent hour-long ‘Captain’s Diary,’ in which Paul McGinley goes through his week in fascinating detail.

Showdown (Elliott and Thompson, £14.99), written by BBC 5 Live’s golf correspondent Iain Carter, fills in all the gaps the film format inevitably leaves — particularly when it follows the ‘official’ line.

Here we find a skilful chronicle of all the drama witnessed during the year before anyone got anywhere near the venue and the incidents from Gleneagles that were left on the cutting room floor, like the fallout from Phil Mickelson’s comments about Tom Watson’s captaincy.

In short, two ideal Christmas presents for the golfer you know.

Quote of the week

‘You could give me another 100 rounds today at The Australian and I wouldn’t sniff 63…. Well done Jordan Spieth, very impressive!’ 

Rory McIlroy, who was the defending champion, paid a warm tribute to the young American who took his title with an extraordinary, final round 63 at the Australian Open on Sunday. A number of astute judges, including former European Tour player Michael Clayton, went so far as to call it the finest round played in the tournament’s long and illustrious history.
