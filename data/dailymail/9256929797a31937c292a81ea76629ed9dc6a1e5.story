While Andy Murray and Tomas Berdych are battling on court in the semi-finals of the Australian Open, their respective fiancees could be waging a duel of jewels in the stands.

Murray and Berdych both proposed to their respective girlfriends - Kim Sears and Ester Satorova - recently before presenting them with expensive diamond rings.

Murray's engagement ring to Sears has been valued at around £250,000 while Berdych's love token is estimated to be worth around £225,000

Kim's £250K ring

Kim's ring:

Kim Sears’s ring (seen yesterday during Murray’s match) is said to be platinum featuring a brilliant-cut diamond of around 3.5 carats, surrounded by smaller stones. 

Diamonds in the shoulders of the ring take the weight up to around 4.7 carats.

Its estimated value for insurance purposes is £250,000.

Ester's £225K ring

Ester's ring:

Ester Satorova’s design (pictured yesterday) is thought to be handmade from platinum. 

It has a square-cut centre diamond of around four carats, set with a pair of baguette stones, taking the total to around 5.3 carats.

Its estimated value for insurance purposes is £225,000.

The British No 1 proposed to Sears, his girlfriend of nine years last year with a 3.5 carat platinum diamond ring, which he is said to have selected himself.

Czech national Berdych, meanwhile, announced his engagement to model Satorova last week and opted for a hand-made four carat square-shaped diamond on a platinum band.

Swimwear model Miss Satorova, who is also Czech, flashed her giant ring while watching world No 7 Berdych’s quarterfinal win against Rafael Nadal in Melbourne.

Murray progressed to the last four with a routine straight sets victory over local favourite Nick Kyrgios on Tuesday.

Diamond specialist and director of Samara James Jewellers, Ed Searancke, said: ‘The Kim Sears ring is based on a very beautiful design made popular by jewellers like Harry Winston.

‘The centre diamond is surrounded by a halo of pave set, round brilliant diamonds, complemented by pave set diamonds in the shoulders of the ring.

Tomas Berdych has been in great form, reaching the last four without dropping a set

‘The ring is mostly likely made from platinum. The total carat weight would be appropriately 4.7 carat.

‘I would estimate the valuation for insurance purposes would be circa £250,000.

‘Ester Satorova’s ring is a more traditional design, drawing from the classic engagement ring designs from the 1940 and 1950s.

‘It appears to be a handmade piece, likely made from platinum, with a square shaped cushion cut centre diamond around 4 carats in weight.

‘The estimated total value would be £120,000 to £170,000 with a valuation for insurance purposes likely to be circa £225,000.’

Murray and Miss Sears, both 27, met in 2005 when 17-year-old Kim was at a tennis championship with her father Nigel Sears, a coach.

Murray, who has an estimated fortune of £30 million and earned £11.5 million last year, is said to have wooed her with phone calls and flowers.

The couple, who live in a £5.6million home in Oxshott, Surrey, are planning their wedding for next autumn, according to Murray’s mother Judy.

Berdych, 29, and Miss Satorova’s relationship has been less lengthy, with the pair getting together in 2012 following his split with fellow tennis pro, Lucie Safarova.

The couple announced their engagement during a Channel Seven interview at the Botanical Gardens in Melbourne on Tuesday last week.

Following the interview, Miss Satorova, also from the Czech Republic, tweeted: ‘Our secret from last year Holiday is OUT.’
