Peep jousting may not be the most well-known Easter tradition, but it certainly is an entertaining one.

The seasonal 'sport' involves inserting toothpicks into two of the chick-shaped marshmallows, placing them in the microwave a few inches apart and watching them expand.

Whichever Peep grows first, causing its toothpick to pierce the other, is the winner.

How it works: Peep jousting involves inserting toothpicks into two of the marshmallows, placing them in the microwave a few inches apart and watching them expand. Whichever Peep pierces the other first is the winner

The loser Peep slowly deflates after it is popped by the wooden weapon.

This unlikely tradition actually has quite the following - a Facebook page dedicated to the battles has received 150 likes.

And in the run-up to Easter, many have taken to Twitter to share their excitement

One enthusiast tweeted: 'I just realized something. This is Peep Season. Get out the microwaves and toothpicks! Peep jousting!!!'

Another fan wrote: 'I'm not sure why one would do anything other than Peep jousting with Peeps.'

But while enthusiasm for the trend appears to be widespread, the best Peep jousting technique remains a point of dispute.

To discover whether fresh or stale Peeps make the best warriors, Smithsonian.com conducted an experiment using one box of marshmallows that had been left open for two weeks, and one that was sealed.

After the fresher Peeps won five battles, the website declared them victorious.

Sugary collapse: When the microwave door is opened, both Peeps appear to have grown significantly, but then they gradually sink and deflate

One excited group of friends posted a video on YouTube of their own marshmallow competition.

The clip shows a pair of dueling Peeps - one green and one pink - placed face-to-face in the microwave.

One of the spectators remarks on the fact that their toothpicks are aimed strategically at the head: 'They're going for the glory,' she says.

The group watches as the marshmallows rotate on the microwave dish, slowly growing in size.

Peeps are often placed in Easter baskets 
and atop mantlepieces as decoration, but there is also a long tradition 
of using them in other creative ways around the springtime holiday.

Indeed, a section on the candy's website called Express your Peepsonality displays artwork, sculptures and even scientific experiments using the marshmallows.

And they are even sometimes featured in dioramas depicting important moments in 
history.

This year the colorful candies are 
celebrating their 60th anniversary, and they seem to show no sign of 
declining in popularity.

In fact Just Born - the company that produces the sugary marshmallows - plans to churn out over one billion of them this Easter season.
