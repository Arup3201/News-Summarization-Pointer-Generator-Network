The Queen has cancelled all engagements scheduled for this week as she recovers from her recent illness, Buckingham Palace said.

The 86-year-old was taken to hospital last Sunday after displaying symptoms of gastroenteritis, and spent 24 hours under doctorsâ€™ observation.

She will not attend any public engagements  but will still be carrying out her official duties from within Buckingham Palace,  it was announced today.

Earlier today the Queen held an audience with writer John Agard, awarding him the 'Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry', at Buckingham Palace.

Yesterday, the Queen 
made her first public appearance in a week as she signed the 
Commonwealth's historic charter to mark Commonwealth Day.

She looked relaxed as she greeted the guests in attendance at Marlborough House in central London, and did not appear to be in discomfort.

Earlier in the day, the monarch had been 
forced to cancel her attendance at the annual Commonwealth Day service - for the first time 
in 20 years - as she still displayed symptoms of gastroenteritis.

This week's scheduled public engagements include a visit London's Tech City tomorrow and attending a chapel 
service on Thursday, but other members of the Royal Family will now take 
her place.

Resting: Despite appearing in good spirits yesterday, the Queen has cancelled a visit to London's Tech City tomorrow and a chapel service on Thursday

The Palace said 
in a statement: 'The Queen continues to make a good recovery following 
her recent illness, and today she presented the Queen's Gold Medal for 
Poetry and held a series of audiences.

'However, regrettably, she will no longer
 attend the Tech City engagement planned for tomorrow, or the Soldiers' 
and Airmen's Scriptures Association Service at the Guards Chapel on 
Thursday.

'The Duke of York will represent The 
Queen at the Tech City visit, and The Duke of Edinburgh will attend the 
Guards Chapel Service as planned.

'Her
 Majesty will, however, continue with the usual rhythm of business at 
Buckingham Palace, including holding a Privy Council meeting tomorrow.

'The Queen hopes to resume her programme of official engagements next week.'

The monarch, who turns 87 next month,  spent 24 hours in hospital last week being treated for the illness which leaves sufferers with vomiting and diarrhoea.

She was struck down by 
the stomach bug just over a week ago, and spent last Sunday night at the 
private King Edward VII's Hospital in central London before being 
discharged on Monday.

Concerns were raised about the 
Queen's general well-being as it was the first time she had been 
admitted to hospital in almost 10 years.

But she left the hospital looking well and cheerful.

Her engagements for last week were cancelled, including a brief visit to Rome to meet Italy's president.

A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said: 
'This time last week she was in hospital but she's in great spirits and 
apart from this is in good health.

'It's just the tail end of the symptoms, her condition has not worsened at all.'
