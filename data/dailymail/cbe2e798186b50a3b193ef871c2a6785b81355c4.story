Mother-of-two Lisa Woodhead fought off a robber who entered her shop and demanded cash from the till by grabbing his genitals

A shop assistant fought off a hammer-wielding robber who demanded cash from the till by grabbing his genitals.

Mother-of-two Lisa Woodhead, 33, was working in the eCloud store in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, on Friday when the robber entered the shop.

The man, who was holding a hammer, then demanded she gave him cash from the till.

But rather than giving in to his demands, the woman wrestled with the man - during which time she made a grab for his genitals.

After 15 minutes, two customers entered the shop and the robber ran away.

South Yorkshire police are investigating the incident and are appealing for witnesses.

Ms Woodhead from Sheffield, South Yorkshire, said: 'I haven’t had a fight for a good few years and that got a good bit of anger out of me.

'He was quite surprised, although I didn’t feel much in my hand so I wouldn’t say he’s too well endowed.

'I was desperate to get rid of him so my only hope was to grab his privates - it was the only way I could attempt to protect myself.

'I was keeping one hand on the hammer which he was holding and so I only had my right hand spare. Thinking back, it certainly puts a smile on my face.'

The mother to Kieran, 14, and Krystal, six, was working alone in the store at around 9.30am on Friday when the man entered the shop and began browsing a selection of e-cigarettes in a glass cabinet before brandishing a hammer at her.

She said: 'He was having a look around and then he came over and said "give me the money".

'My first reaction was just "what?" but he repeated himself. He was holding the hammer in the air with one hand and he was banging the buttons on the till with the other, trying to open it.

'I grabbed the hammer to stop him hitting me with it, and we ended up in a scuffle and went into the back room. I was refusing to let go.'

The intruder then began pushing the worker into the shop’s bathroom and on to the floor.

Desperate to fend him off, the mother grabbed his privates and in an attempt to punch him, scratched his face.

She said: 'I was absolutely terrified. As he pushed me into the bathroom, I thought he was going to overpower me. I’m only a little lady and he seemed to be stopping at nothing to get what he wanted.

'All I could think about was my kids, and whether I was going to see them again. But I was determined not to give up without a fight.

'I’ve got his DNA under my fingernails - we were fighting for about 15 minutes.'

Eventually, Ms Woodhead heard the shop door ring as two customers entered.

She screamed for help - and the man fled after threatening the couple with the hammer.

Ms Woodhead added: 'He was kicking me in the back and I was shouting for help. He ran off with his hammer in the air.

'People have called me brave but it could have been a different story so maybe it was a bit stupid of me. I just couldn’t let him brazenly steal from the shop whether he had a hammer or not.'

During the fight, the thief ripped the mother's gold chain from her neck and grabbed an empty e-cigarette packet from the side - which she believes he thought was her purse.

The shop assistant says she 'didn't feel much' when she grabbed the man's genitals. Police are now investigating the incident and appealing for witnesses

She added: 'I was so relieved. The man who came into the shop chased him down the street but the thief got away.

'He left empty-handed other than my gold chain and that’s mine. He didn’t take anything from the shop, but he still got away with something.

'I am going back to work this week but I am a bit reluctant. You just don’t know what lengths people will go to.'

South Yorkshire Police confirmed they are investigating the incident, and detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

The intruder is described as wearing dark clothing and a dark hat.

Lisa added: 'He had some cheek trying to break into a shop first thing in the morning without covering his face.

'It was only the beginning of the day so we didn’t even have any takings, but he obviously thought I was going to give him what he wanted without a fight.

'Anyone who can help, please come forward because I don’t want it to happen to anyone else. Next time it could be someone who can’t defend themselves.'

Anyone with any information should call South Yorkshire police on 101 quoting incident number 304 of February 7.
