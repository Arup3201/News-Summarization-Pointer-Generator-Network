Britain’s ability to meet its water needs is at a ‘critical point’, according to a report.

It says water use should be drastically reduced and bills increased to penalise over consumption, as increasing temperatures and a rising population stretch resources.

The Institute of Civil Engineers said the Government’s water strategy does not recognise the ‘urgency’ of the situation.

They also said that hosepipe bans are not an effective long-term solution to the problem.

In terms of ‘water security’ – our ability to meet the needs of homes and businesses regardless of the weather – the institute gave the UK a score of only four out of ten.

On the scale one means constant drought and ten is perfect water security.

They said the situation would only get worse without a national strategy to curb consumption by 30 per cent.

Currently we use 150 litres (33 gallons) a day per person, but the report said we should aim for 105 litres (23 gallons).

Recommendation: The report said universal water metering should be introduced to penalise non-essential use, such as car washing, as seen in this file picture

Among its recommendations, the report said universal water metering should be introduced to penalise non-essential use, such as car washing.

They also suggested bringing in new technology to help water companies plug leaks.

But the institute ruled out the construction of a ‘national water grid’ which could pipe water across the country from areas of high rainfall.

They said such a system would be ‘extremely costly’ and would take many years to construct, by which time the situation would have worsened.
