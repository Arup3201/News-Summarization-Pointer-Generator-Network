Once the centrepiece to weeks of high-spirits over the festive period, thousands of Christmas trees now litter the streets of Britain as rubbish collectors fail to dispose of the discarded decorations.

As these images taken by photographer Gareth Cattermole show, the mess lingers long after the party season has drawn to a close, with hundreds of streets left cluttered with abandoned trees.

Mr Cattermole's photographs were taken in Islington in north London on January 8 - three days after Twelfth Night, when Christmas decorations are traditionally taken down and trees are often dumped in the street.

Mr Cattermole's depressing photographs show a number of Christmas trees that have been discarded outside expensive townhouses in the Angel area of Islington in north London.

He originally set out to depict the irony of 
something once so cherished ending up abandoned.

While some trees appear to have been discarded with a degree of care others have been carelessly thrown into roads or left leaning against walls.

Although these images may suggest otherwise, discarding Christmas trees in the street is something Islington council has sought to stamp out.

There were four specific sites set up this year for those residents able to transport their trees in cars or vans, all of which remain open until January 12.

There is a widely-held belief that it is bad luck to leave Christmas decorations, including the tree, up past Twelfth Night. This is an idea previously attached to Candlemass

There is a widely-held belief that it is bad luck to leave Christmas decorations, including the tree, up past Twelfth Night – an idea previously attached to the festival of Candlemass in early February.

There is also some debate over when 
exactly Twelfth Night falls, with some arguing it is the evening before 
the Twelfth Day, also known as the Epiphany.

Others say it falls the following evening, as Twelfth Day itself draws to a close.
