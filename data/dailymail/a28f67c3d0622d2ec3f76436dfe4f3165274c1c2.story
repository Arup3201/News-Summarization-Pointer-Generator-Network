Iraqi security forces killed eight ISIS assailants disguised in Iraqi Army uniforms during an attack Friday against an air base where 320 U.S Marines are currently training Iraqi troops, military officials said.

The strike on the Ain al-Asad base, which is currently being plummeted with rocket fire, came after insurgents from the Islamic State took Al-Baghdadi, a neighboring town only nine miles away from the base. 

They launched their offense on the base after poor weather halted air strikes, led by eight suicide bombers who were followed by an additional 15 men.

This as the U.S. has retaliated by bringing in helicopter gunships to support Iraqi ground forces battling ISIS militants in al-Baghdadi, drawing them closer to combat with the terrorist organization.

Although the facility has been re-secured, ISIS took control of neighboring town Al-Baghdadi this morning and are now pummeling the air base with rocket fire and mortars 

'I think what we're seeing here is mission creep,' Robert Baer, a former CIA officer, told CNN.

'The Iraqi army is not up to the task. And without the United States Air Force and the military on the ground, a lot of these ... bases would be overrun.'

No American troops were injured during the ISIS attack early Friday. 

'They were immediately engaged by members of the Iraqi army, the 7th Infantry of the Iraqi Army, and all were killed,' said Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby of the ISIS militants. 

No U.S. military service members were under direct threat from the attack, as they were several miles away, but two Iraqi soldiers were killed and several were wounded.

Iraqi forces have since re-secured the facility.

But the fighting rages on in Al-Baghdadi, which was seized after ISIS militants attacked from three different directions.

No evacuations from the base have been planned, but it is currently being hit with 'indirect fire' via rocket launchers and mortars, officials told CNN.

Iraqi officials have since called for reinforcements,

It is currently where U.S. Marines are training members of the Iraqi 7th division and Iraqi pilots.   

Al-Baghdadi has been besieged for months by ISIS, which captured swathes of northern and western Iraq last year.

This prompted a campaign of U.S-led air strikes and the deployment of hundreds of U.S. military advisers to the country.  

On Wednesday President Obama formally requested from Congress the authority to use military force in the war against ISIS. 

The proposal does not ask for the deployment of ground troops. 

During a press conference the president said: 'Our coalition is on the offensive, ISIL is on the defensive and ISIL is going to lose.'
