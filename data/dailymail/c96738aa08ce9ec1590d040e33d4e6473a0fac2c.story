Former deputy head Tony Wheeler, 84, left his £3m fortune to 16 local charities, including the church in Sudbury where his family were life-long worshippers

A former deputy headteacher who died without any close relatives left his £3m fortune to charity, including more than £200,000 to the church where his family were life-long worshippers.

Multi-millionaire Tony Wheeler died in June 2012, aged 84, after a battle with pancreatic cancer. 

Now it has emerged that Mr Wheeler left almost half of his fortune to 16 local organisations, including Sudbury's United Reformed Church.

He left the other half to a long list of national charities which were close to his heart.  

Friends of the retired schoolmaster, who was described as a 'perfect gentleman', said they were stunned he had left so much money.

The church secretary also said he was 'not even sure' if Mr Wheeler himself knew he had that much money saved away.

Mr Wheeler, the former deputy headmaster at Royal Worcester Grammar School, spent much of his working life at the prestigious school.

It is believed he saved up his millions through inheritance, as well as making 'bold' investments using the salary from his deputy's post. 

He retired to his home town of Sudbury, Suffolk, in 1987, but never married and did not have any close relatives. 

He lived modestly and did not smoke or drink. 

David Cocksedge, probate manager at legal firm Bates, Wells and Braithwaite, based in Sudbury, said Mr Wheeler had requested that virtually all of his money should go to national and local charities.

Secretary of the United Reform Church Chris Proffitt said the £215,000 would be used for a number of projects, including lighting up the spire which Mr Wheeler liked to look at from his bedroom window.

He said: 'No-one dreamt Tony had that amount of money and I'm not even sure if he knew that he had that much.

'It was a wonderful gift that has enabled us to make a significant improvement to our church hall.

'It's used by around 140 people each week and is the best facility in town, so we have regenerated it to make it much more user friendly.

'We have also illuminated the spire in Tony's memory, which he used to enjoy seeing from his bedroom window.'

Mr Wheeler also donated £200,000 to Suffolk Wildlife Trust, which is using the money to buy a 78-acre extension at Assington, near Sudbury.

Christine Luxton, head of development at the countryside trust, said: 'It's an amazing nature reserve and over the years we have extended it greatly through the generosity of people like Mr Wheeler.

Mr Wheeler left £215,000 to Subury's United Reformed Church, some of which is being used to light up the spire which the keen historian could see from his bedroom window 

'When someone leaves us a legacy like this, we have a huge responsibility to do something fantastic with it. We chose this site because it was close to where Mr Wheeler lived and we felt it would connect to his life, but it is there for everyone to enjoy.'

Gainsborough's House, the museum and art gallery at the birthplace of leading 18th century painter Thomas Gainsborough, was also given £105,000 by Mr Wheeler.

The money has been used to extend its shop and a room in the house will also be named after Mr Wheeler. 

Mark Bills said: 'It was an extraordinary thing for someone to do and has made an enormous difference to us.

'The money has allowed us to think about moving forward and expanding. We are going to put up a thank you board and Mr Wheeler's name will be at the top.' 

Some of the other beneficiaries of Mr Wheeler's include The Eden Project in Cornwall, national charity The Salvation Army, and several other churches around the area, all of which were given £50,000. 

Mr Wheeler, a keen local historian, published a book exploring the origins of street names in Sudbury, entitled What's in a Name, just before he died.

He left his extensive collection of maps and books to the Libraries Museums Records and Amenities Committee at Suffolk County Council. 

Mr Wheeler also left unknown sums to The RSPCA, Guide Dogs for the Blind Association, The Royal National Institute of Blind People, Jesus College Cambridge, the Suffolk Historic Churches Trust and Royal British Legion.

As a special tribute to his family predecessors, £6,000 was left to provide commemorative seats in the town cemetery. 

He also made a number of £5,000 bequests to individuals.
