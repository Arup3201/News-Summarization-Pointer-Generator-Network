The Church's two most senior figures came under fire yesterday after claiming the poor are being left behind and whole cities swallowed up in a 'cycle of decline'.

In a highly political intervention – coinciding with the start of the General Election campaign – the Archbishops of Canterbury and York insisted that the Coalition was 'casting aside' the poor while chasing votes in Middle England.

As a result, they said, Britain had become dominated by 'rampant' individualism, is 'ill at ease with itself' and was in many places 'trapped in apparently inevitable decline'.

Last night David Cameron said he 'profoundly disagreed' with the two archbishops. And angry MPs said their comments were simply inaccurate and accused the primates of straying too far into the political arena.

The controversy drew comparisons with the 'Faith In The City' saga of 30 years ago, when the CofE's views on poverty in the cities were dismissed by Margaret Thatcher's government as 'Marxist'.

The comments were made by the Archbishops of Canterbury and York in a campaigning book to be published next week.

The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, and his counterpart from York, the Most Reverend Dr John Sentamu, put their names to a series of essays that quoted the words of Karl Marx with approval and attacked politicians for trying to appeal to 'the swing vote of Middle England'.

Anger: Lord Tebbit said the church should concentrate on dealing with its own problems

Their book, On Rock or Sand?, declared that many are 'left behind' by 'rampant consumerism' and individualism.

One Tory source described the bishops' analysis as 'ridiculous', adding: 'It's so far out there I'm not sure it merits a response.'

Former Tory Deputy Prime Minister Lord Heseltine, who built his reputation in the 1980s on reviving the fortunes of northern cities, called the archbishops 'out of touch'.

He said on Radio 4's World at One that Archbishop Welby's description of the spiral of decline of cities outside London was wrong. 'I have spent some 30 or 40 years dealing with leaders in local authorities,' he said. 'And the transformation, and they acknowledge this, is extraordinary.'

Lord Tebbit said the Church should concentrate on dealing with its own difficulties with falling congregations, lack of money and shortage of priests, before it started telling other people what to do.

Downing Street, however, sought to play down the row. The Prime Minister's official spokesman said the Church had made 'important points about the need to do more to support families'. 

However, the spokesman stressed the Government had launched many initiatives to boost growth in England's cities, particularly in the North.

And northern business chiefs said they were deeply angered by the views of Archbishop Welby. James Ramsbotham, chief executive of the North East Chamber of Commerce, said: 'We have been growing faster than any other region, and our exports mean we have a positive balance of payments.'

Critics of Archbishop Welby said that Treasury figures show that over the past year 65 per cent of all private sector job growth has come from outside the South East. They added that Manchester and Leeds are growing faster than London and unemployment is falling across the North of England.

The book was edited by Dr Sentamu and featured a contribution from the Archbishop of Canterbury. Despite assurances that it did not amount to socialism, it was greeted with enthusiasm by Ed Miliband. He said: 'David Cameron used to say 'we're all in this together'. Today, Church leaders are saying they don't believe him.'

They were wrong last time... this time they're irrelevant: Commentary by DAMIAN THOMPSON

The quickest way to ruin a dinner party is to talk about the Christian belief in an after-life. ‘Heaven? It’s just a fantasy cooked up by clergy to keep themselves in a job,’ a typical metropolitan hostess might say, her lip curling as she spoons out the asparagus soufflé.

To which I can only reply: in 20 years of covering religious affairs as a journalist, I have almost never heard vicars or priests talk about heaven – except from the narrow confines of the pulpit, and even then not very often.

Echo: One of Margaret Thatcher's ministers described similar comments as 'Marxist'

But I certainly hear clergy talk incessantly about another fantasy world. It’s a Britain in which they talk about the ‘gulf between rich and poor’.

This always seems to be a nicely flexible concept that they never precisely define. Above all, it is always ‘widening’ and they argue that society’s ills can be miraculously solved if only more taxpayers’ money was spent on them as if it was holy water.

This week, they are it again with a book that deliberately echoes the infamous ‘Faith In The City’ report published by the Church of England in 1985 when Margaret Thatcher was prime minister.

It controversially called for greater government spending in every conceivable area (except on the country’s military defences, of course) and was denounced by one Thatcherite minister as ‘Marxist’.

Such criticism was, I believe, over the top – but make no mistake: the truth is that the Church of England tried to strangle the Thatcherite reforms that turned Britain into the economic capital of Europe.

The Church failed in it efforts – and it seems that Archbishop Sentamu is still very bitter.

In his new book, he says he is sorry that the Church lost its nerve in its response to what he calls the ‘savage attack’ of Thatcherism.

But he is wrong. The Left-wing bishops did not lose their nerve: they actually did everything in their power to elect Labour’s Neil Kinnock as prime minister. And then when that failed, too, they went into a sulk.

Perhaps the most depressing aspect of this offensive by the Church of England is the involvement of the Archbishop of Canterbury. The fact is that some of what he says is patently not true.

Of course, there are parts of Britain that, sadly, struggle with poverty and addiction, but that does not make us ‘a people in crisis’.

We are embarked on a fragile economic recovery, under a Government that is attempting to reduce inequality by ambitious and expensive welfare reforms.

Yet, as in 1985, the Church of England apparently wants to derail that recovery, by painting a picture of an economic landscape so apocalyptic that voters will take the risk of making Ed Miliband prime minister and putting Ed Balls – God help us – in charge of the country’s finances.

This is surprising given Justin Welby’s background: having worked for an international oil company and having been a supporter of Mrs Thatcher. He is the first Primate of All England who can argue with economists in their own language.

Veering: With a background in the oil industry, Justin Welby's lurch to the left is somewhat surprising

So why has he veered so sharply to the Left?

One reason is that he was appalled by the poverty he encountered for the first time when, having packed in his business career, he trained for the Anglican ministry in Durham. Also, his stepfather, Lord Williams of Elvel, is a Labour peer.

Even so, no one expected him to be quite so hostile to the government led by his fellow Old Etonian David Cameron.

Central to the current Church/State battle is the Archbishop of York – a vigorous Christian and a brave man who, in his native Uganda, was jailed for criticising the country’s blood-drenched leader Idi Amin.

But – and I’m sorry if this sounds rude – he is also an unreconstructed old Lefty whose interminable anti-colonialist rants had General Synod members rushing for the door back in the early-1990s.

To coincide with his new book, Dr John Sentamu has given an interview to the Spectator’s Isabel Hardman. She asked him what right the Church has to poke its nose into politics when its congregations are dwindling.

His response was feeble –blathering on about the number of people who attended the carol service at York Minster.

He also claimed that the ‘Bishop of Blackpool’ invited him to an event and that they ‘fill the ballroom in Blackpool with 350 people who want to come and find faith in Christ.’

Three hundred and fifty people? That hardly compares with the thousands who attend Pentecostal rallies in the developing world. And there is no Bishop of Blackpool. Presumably he means Blackburn.

The truth is that church congregations have shrunk by a third to just 800,000 a week since Faith In The City was published. The CofE’s bureaucracy, though, is bigger than ever – and invested with a public-sector mentality that makes its pronouncements hard to distinguish from those of the public service union Unison.

Ultimately, a key reason for the Church of England’s hostility to market forces lies in its own failure to sell itself.

Church attendance has fallen off a cliff – and the same would be true of Catholics, too, if it were not for the presence here of immigrants.

Embarrassed by this fact, bishops are reduced to pontificating about the ‘scandal’ of food banks and issues such as climate change.

I hate to say this, but perhaps it’s just as well that, come the election, most of us won’t pay the slightest attention to the advice of our Christian leaders.
