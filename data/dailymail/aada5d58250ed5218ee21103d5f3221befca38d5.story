Before the match, Ally McCoist denied his position was bombproof and it required a spectacular missile from Lewis Macleod to stop yet more flak being aimed in the direction of the Rangers manager.

Macleod’s overhead strike — as good as you’ll see in any league all season — arrived early and, despite a high quota of chances at both ends, was enough to see the Ibrox club maintain their six-point distance from Championship leaders Hearts.

Defeat last Monday night had brought McCoist’s position into question and, had Livingston displayed the same assurance in front of goal as Hibernian, the fortitude of the Rangers boss’s tenure may indeed have been put to the test.

Equally, the mysterious boardroom machinations at Ibrox might prove a continued source of security for the manager. Last week’s headline news saw Mike Ashley increase his holding to 8.9 per cent but the Newcastle United owner made his investment outwith the recent open share offer, thus denying the club working capital — and quite possibly the cash reserves that would be required to fulfil severance obligations, should they be required.

For now, McCoist continues to plod on and, if Rangers lack the momentum that keeps Hearts rolling on at the top, they just about recovered their balance to edge out a Livingston team that left the field with their share of regret at missed chances.

Rangers’ starting line-up featured five changes; those who survived Monday’s 3-1 defeat could consider themselves fortunate. Bilel Mohsni was the one obligatory change, courtesy of a retrospective two-match ban offered by the SFA after he hit out at Hibs defender Liam Fontaine.

Darren McGregor, Steven Smith, Arnold Peralta and Dean Shiels were all dropped with Macleod, Richard Foster, Fraser Aird, Nicky Clark and Mohsni’s replacement Marius Zaliukas given the chance to impress.

One theory attached to Rangers’ ascent through the divisions is that it has occurred without the need for any real tactical masterplan from McCoist and his staff. It’s certainly true that you cannot coach the sort of natural ability utilised by Macleod.

A heart complaint limited the exciting midfielder’s involvement during the team’s League One campaign but this was a strike to set everyone’s pulses racing.

Credit in the first instance to Aird, who pressed Livingston midfielder Keaghan Jacobs deep into his own territory where he conceded possession. As the home team attempted to clear their lines and restore a high defensive line from the throw, Ian Black returned the ball high towards the back post.

Everyone else had raced out but Macleod, having checked he was onside at the point of delivery, remained in situ and adjusted his feet for the most acrobatic of finishes — an overhead volley that would have graced any occasion.

Had Livingston displayed even half of Macleod’s conviction they might have taken something from the match. Danny Mullen had squandered a chance to draw first blood when he lost composure with a clear sight on goal and scooped his shot high.

Former Hearts player Gary Glen was also weak with a first-time effort although he couldn’t have been warmed up, having been forced into action as a replacement for Craig Sives after the tall defender had been stretchered off after taking a Nicky Law shot full in the face.

Having started as the better team, the home side were penned in towards half-time and Sives’s block was not the only last-gasp intervention — skipper Jason Talbot twice denied Kris Boyd and Kyle Jacobs stretched to thwart Aird in the act of shooting.

The case of Boyd gets curiouser by the week. Having scored 22 goals for Premiership side Kilmarnock last season, he was expected to blitz the Championship but has laboured and remains goalless after eight starts. One moment just after the break summed up his season to date.

As Foster drove towards the byeline the striker made his trademark move to the penalty spot and prepared for the cut-back. When it duly arrived, he missed the ball completely with his once deadly right boot.

Eventually, McCoist’s patience gave way and so did Boyd, for Jon Daly. Rangers still had enough chances to wrap up the game before enduring a nervy close.

Lee McCulloch had a shot pushed over by Darren Jamieson and Clark blasted over after being provided with an open goal chance by Lee Wallace.

By the end it was Livingston asking the more serious questions.

Jordan White came close with a low drive but it was Kyle Jacobs who caused panic among the Rangers support. First he drove a long-range effort into the side-netting and then climbed to head an effort that required Black to knock off the line.

Livingston protested furiously that the ball had crossed the line. McCoist simply breathed a sigh of relief.
