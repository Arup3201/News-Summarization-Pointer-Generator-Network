BBC workers have been forced to eat with their hands after cutlery ran out in a staff canteen at the corporation's £1billion headquarters.

Furious workers have had to eat gammon steaks and jacket potatoes without knives and forks after the implements went missing.

Staff have now called for a cutlery amnesty at the BBC's New Broadcasting House (NBH) to put an end to the 'forking ridiculous' situation.

'Forking ridiculous': Workers at the BBC's £1billion New Broadcasting House have called for a cutlery amnesty after being forced to eat with their hands because of a lack of knives and forks in the staff canteen

Writing to BBC in-house magazine Ariel earlier this week, rights manager Martin Freeman said: 'Can the powers that be please issue a BBC property wide amnesty asking for the safe return of all knives and forks at, what would appear to be, all buildings but of most concern to this 'canteen user', the News Café at NBH.

'There appears to be a perpetual cutlery issue in NBH and, by the sounds of it, at other BBC sites. 

'Has someone got a waste metal scam going or is it just that everyone is incapable of returning cutlery to a place where it may go back into general use again? Check your drawers, bags and pockets.

'Please god, I don't want a lame excuse, I just want a knife and fork to eat with in the shambles that is designated as the only 'staff only' canteen in NBH - small, badly designed and overfull at most times and sadly lacking in any substantial cutlery (plastic does not count).'

The complaint followed a similar plea from BBC worker Dara Maguire.

Writing to Ariel in October, he said: 'Could people in W12 please stop taking the forks from the Broadcast Centre canteen? There are never any forks at lunchtime. It's forking ridiculous.'  

A worker at a BBC centre in north-west London told the Sun on Sunday that the situation was a 'complete joke'.

He said: 'A lot of people are burning their hands picking up food and some staff are obviously hoarding cutlery. It's annoying.'

A BBC spokesman said: 'Our catering provider is working to ensure that sufficient cutlery is available across all outlets. Staff are encouraged to not remove metal cutlery from canteens.'
