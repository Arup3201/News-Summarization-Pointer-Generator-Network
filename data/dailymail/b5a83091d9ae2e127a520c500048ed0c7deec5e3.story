The Mail on Sunday’s T-shirt investigation took a sinister twist last week as our journalists were spied on and followed by security guards from the CMT factory.

The men, among them drivers for factory boss Francois Woo, tailed MoS reporter Ben Ellery and photographer Craig Hibbert for hours along the island’s palm-fringed roads. 

At one point they were even lying in wait when the journalists arrived at a secluded riverside hotel they had checked in to only hours before.

Though the burly guards made no approach to the MoS journalists, it was clear their aim was to monitor their movements and to intimidate any factory workers who may have wanted to speak out.

Ellery and Hibbert first became aware they were the subject of unwelcome attention on Thursday when they visited a CMT factory in a sprawling industrial estate in Phoenix, just outside the island’s capital Port Louis, at noon. 

They had planned to speak to more of the migrant workers about their working conditions at the plant.

Seeing four guards on the razor wire-topped gate, the pair waited at nearby food stalls, hoping the workers would go there for lunch. 

However, they were told by a local shopkeeper that the only workers who leave the complex at lunchtime were Mauritians, rather than their colleagues from Bangladesh, Vietnam and India.

The journalists began talking to the Mauritian factory workers and within minutes a team of security officers began to station themselves around the stalls, setting an intimidating atmosphere sure to keep workers from talking to our journalists.

Ellery and Hibbert got back in their car and drove away while the guards looked on.

The MoS team visited a union office in Port Louis. 

Afterwards, when they got back in their car, they spotted a grey BMW parked further up the street with two of the guards sitting in it.

The car started following the journalists, sticking close though several turns in busy traffic. At one point the MoS car made a quick turn, shaking off the watchers, then went back around the block to find the confused guards parked at the side of the road, looking in all directions as the traffic sped by.

Hibbert quickly pulled in front of them blocking them in, and got out of the car to photograph the men. Suddenly the security team became shy and pulled down the car’s sun visors to obscure their faces, then unhooked the visors to shield themselves.

One of them attempted to take a photograph of the journalists using his mobile phone before reversing the car out of the tight spot and driving off.

Five minutes later, the journalists realised the same car was behind them again. Once again, they made a few quick turns, confirming they were being tailed, before losing them down an alleyway.

That evening the journalists returned to Port Louis only to find one of the men who had been following them earlier standing in the shadows outside the hotel with another man.

Ellery said: ‘We were particularly shocked as we had only changed hotels hours before and made sure we hadn’t been followed. 

'By this time we started to feel uneasy and asked the parking attendant about the men. He told us that they were drivers for Francois Woo.’

However there was no sign of Mr Woo in the hotel, and reception staff confirmed he was not a guest nor having a meeting there.

The men lurked outside the hotel until 11pm. 

The following day when the MoS team returned to the factory in Phoenix, one of the men was waiting inside the compound. When asked, he denied following them the previous day.

According to global union IndustriALL, such sinister activity is not uncommon in Mauritius.

A spokesman said: ‘Union leaders have their phones tapped and are followed by the secret police.

‘It is not uncommon for factory managements to establish unions that they control in order to mask their poor labour practices.’
