Sir Frank Williams is keeping his Formula One business in the family by promoting his daughter, Claire, to the newly-created role of deputy team principal.

The announcement comes two weeks after Sir Frank's wife, Lady Virginia, 66, known as 'Ginny', died following a two-year battle with cancer.

Sir Frank, 70, said his wife would have been proud of his daughter as she takes a leading position in the male dominated sport.

He said: 'With Claire being appointed deputy team 
principal, I know the future of Williams is in extremely safe hands. 
This appointment also had Ginny’s blessing, who I know would have been 
incredibly proud to have seen Claire taking on this position by my 
side.'

The team had planned on announcing the 
appointment just before the start of the current season, but decided on a
delay in light of Lady Virginia's death.

Hard fought: Sir Frank said his daughter had to battle his own prejudices to gain her senior role

Miss Williams, 36, takes on the role with immediate effect  and will retain her current position as commercial director and continue to be part of the company’s board.

Sir Frank said he is keen to hand over the reins to the next generation and his daughter's appointment was not handed to her on a plate.

He said: 'It is no secret that Claire
is my daughter but I am proud to say that she has fought hard to earn 
this appointment and of all the battles she has had to fight, the 
prejudices of her father were not the least challenging,'

After obtaining a degree in politics 
from Newcastle University, Miss Williams became the team’s press officer
in 2002. She had a succession of promotions before becoming director of
marketing and communications.

On her latest promotion, she said: 'I have grown up in the sport and learnt the ropes from 
one of Formula One’s legendary team principals and as a result I feel 
well equipped for this new challenge.

'I understand the commitment that 
every person within the team gives each day to see our car out on the 
track, and I am determined to see us back at the top.

'It
has been a sad month for my family and Williams as a company following 
the death of my mother, but as the season takes hold we must look to the
future. It will be a privilege to play a part in taking the team into 
what I hope will be a successful next chapter.'

If Miss Williams does eventually take over from her father as team 
principal, she will not be the first woman to run a Formula One outfit. 
Swiss-based Sauber already have Monisha Kaltenborn as principal.

Her promotion is also not the first time Williams have struck a blow for equality in the sport. They also have Susie Wolff, 30, on their team as a test driver.

Williams, winners of nine constructors' and seven drivers' world 
championships between 1980 and 1997, are seeking to regain their former glory when names including Nigel Mansell, Damon Hill and Jenson Button drove for them.

They have yet to score a point in two 
races this season with Venezuelan driver Pastor Maldonado and Finnish rookie 
Valtteri Bottas. The team finished eighth overall in 2012.

Father-of-three Sir Frank, co-founder of the Williams Formula 1 team, is confident is daughter is up to the job of steering the team to more success. He said: 'Over the past decade Claire has worked tirelessly for Williams. Her knowledge of the sport and passion for the team is unquestionable, and I’m proud to say during her time here she has proven herself to be one of our most valuable assets.'
