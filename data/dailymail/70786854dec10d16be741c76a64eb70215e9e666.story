Labour grandee Peter Mandelson today insisted broadcasters could not empty chair David Cameron if he refused to take part in TV debates.

The former cabinet minister said the BBC, ITV, Sky and Channel Four were not entitled to ‘impose what they want  on the political parties’ and the Prime Minister was within his rights to ignore them.

The former BBC chair Michael Grade accused the broadcasters of using 'bullying' tactics to force the Prime Minister into the debates and said they were in danger of breaching strict rules on impartiality.

Lord Mandelson, speaking at a business conference organised by the trade magazine Retail Week, suggested that the broadcasters were acting as if they had more power than they did.

But he said Labour leader Ed Miliband was also perfectly entitled to score political points over Mr Cameron’s refusal to take part in the debates.

The Labour peer asked if he would advise Mr Cameron not to show up for the TV debates.

He said: ‘I wouldn’t tell him to do that. I would say that there’s an expectation that you will debate properly with others. Voters feel they are entitled to have that sort of debate and comparison directly in front of them.'

However, Lord Mandelson added: ‘I think David Cameron is entitled not to do that debate in the particular way that the broadcasters have described and the Labour Party is entitled to make him look and appear completely frit and chicken and force him to take a hit for not doing the debates.

‘What I don’t think is that the broadcasters are entitled to impose what they want on the political parties and empty chair party leaders.

‘I don’t think the broadcasters have that entitlement. They are at the end of the day broadcasters – they are not the House of Commons. Who elected them?’

Tory peer Michael Grade accused the broadcasters of using 'bullying' tactics to force the Prime Minister into the debates and said they were in danger of breaching strict rules on impartiality

The Labour peer's remarks come after Lord Grade, who served as chairman of the BBC board of governors between 2004 and 2006, defended Mr Cameron for refusing to take part in any debates during the election campaign.

Mr Cameron has agreed to take part in one debate with six other party leaders – but has insisted it takes place before the official start of the election campaign on March 30.

The broadcasters however have insisted the debates must take place in April – just weeks before the election – and insisted they would go ahead with or without Mr Cameron.

But the threat to empty chair the Prime Minister in the proposed head-to-head against Mr Miliband on 30 April – a week before polling day – was attacked by Lord Grade.

The Tory peer told Radio 4's Today programme it was right that the broadcasters should organise debates – but insisted it was up to political leaders if they wanted to take part.

He said: 'The idea that broadcasters can threaten politicians with empty chairs, real or imaginary, is completely unacceptable and against the statutory requirement for impartiality.

'It is not for the broadcasters to threaten the prime minister and risk breaching their duty of impartiality.

'The BBC should stand up today and say that they are not going to empty-chair anybody or to threaten anybody.

'These debates are fun to have, maybe nice to have. The benefits or the dis-benefits you can argue it either way. But there is no requirement that they should be done. And there is a requirement on the broadcasters for impartiality.'

The Conservatives believe Mr Cameron's election chances suffered by his decision to take part in TV election debates

Lord Grade, who left the BBC to become executive chairman of ITV, was scathing about the broadcasters' handling of the debate negotiations.

He said: 'I don't think the broadcasters have covered themselves in glory in the way that they have campaigned for these debates, the way they have gone public early on, the way they have messed it up by missing out various parties. The thing is a shambles. It is embarrassing, frankly.'

In an article in the Times, Lord Grade accused the broadcasters of trying to bully the prime minister by threatening to signal his absence from the debates with an empty chair.

He wrote: 'It is bullying, a case of the broadcast media getting way ahead of itself.'

Lord Grade added: 'Who do the broadcasters think they are? Their behaviour over the election debates leads me to believe they suddenly have grossly inflated and misguided ideas of their own importance.'
