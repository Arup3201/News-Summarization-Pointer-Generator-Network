Miffed: Ian Payne was stunned to learn that he now needs to ring a call centre 7,000 miles away in the Philippines to order a pint of milk from a dairy just down the road from his home in Walsall

A couple have been left with a sour taste in their mouths after learning they have to ring the Philippines to order a pint of milk from their dairy down the road.

Ian and Liz Payne were baffled when they were told to phone a call centre nearly 7,000 miles away to order an extra pint of milk just seven miles from their home in Walsall, West Midlands.

Leaving a note in a milk bottle is now a thing of the past for customers of Dairy Crest - who are now asked to make changes to their order via a call centre in Manila, Philippines - 6,703 miles away from the depot in Burntwood, Staffs.

Mr Payne, 49, a house husband and researcher, said: 'I couldn't believe what I was hearing when I was told I'd have to ring someone on the other side of the world to get a pint of milk delivered. It's utterly ridiculous.

'I always either ordered through my milkmen or by calling the depot, they were both very helpful up until last week.

'If they have to have call centres at least have them in this country, and give the work to people here.

'Have we really got to the stage where we can't order a bottle of milk without going halfway around the world?'

Mr Payne phoned his local depot last Monday to order some juice as part of his round, when he was re-directed to the Filipino call-centre.

He said: 'What's more, is that I was told officiously that I needed a customer number beginning with a letter. I could see where it was going, a nightmare journey just to order some juice.'

Dairy Crest insist that the call centre will offer customers a more streamlined service, allowing them to change their orders up to 9pm the night before delivery.

The Surrey-based firm also said that customers can still leave a note for the milkmen if they like, but that the process would be a lot slower.

A Dairy Crest spokeswoman said: 'Our doorstop delivery has over one million customers in England and Wales, with 250,000 of these customers being online.

'In response to the needs of our customers we have introduced longer service hours and one convenient telephone number.

'Traditionally, our depots could not service customer calls in the late afternoon or evening whereas our centralised service allows anyone, anywhere, to call us between 8am and 9pm during the week, and between 8am and 4pm on Saturday.'
