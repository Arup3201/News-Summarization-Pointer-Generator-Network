Chris Bernier, the manager at a Domino’s Pizza joint in Saginaw, Michigan, has been fired after repeatedly swearing at a customer  in an argument over a wrong order

Brandi Averill, right, confront the manager at the restaurant in Saginaw after he allegedly put the phone down on her and her son over an incorrect order. Her daughter, left, film the incident on her phone

‘My supervisors name is “go f*** yourself,”’ get the f*** outta here!’ says the manager in a shockingly bad example of customer service.

According to Averill, the incident started after her son complained about receiving a pizza with ‘light sauce’ instead of the ‘white sauce’ they had ordered.

‘The guy hung up on (my son),’ she told WNEM.

When the manager hung up on her too, she showed up in person, along with her daughter who recorded the incident on her cell phone.

The manager, who has been identified as Chris Bernier, is immediately rude to the customer. 

Bernier, who has been fired, has said that he regrets the incident but also that the footage doesn't show everything that happened to provoke his abuse

The store's owner has said that he feels embarrassed by Bernier's behavior and Domino's Corporation have also released a statement to distance themselves from the outburst

'Did you come here to get your money back because I really don’t care much for your opinion,’ he tells her.

When Averill persistently asks for his supervisor's name, he unleashed his verbal tirade although the customer isn't shy about giving as good as she gets.

'Excuse me, I’m not the one in a pizza outfit when I’m 40 years old so don’t be calling me a retard,' she yelled at Bernier.

As the incident came to light via social media, Bernier has been fired from his job as the store's general manager.

'I regret the language I used, but if people could see everything that happened, especially in the phone calls, they would not be sympathetic for this woman,' he told WNEM. 

Averill has also admitted that she wasn't completely innocent, but says the treatment she received was still uncalled for.

'I didn't go about any of this to get him fired. I just wanted his supervisor to know that you need to talk to customers nicely,' she said.

The store's owner Rob Asmar has said he feels embarrassed by the incident and Domino's Corporation have released a statement to distance themselves from Bernier's behavior.

'The comments made by this person do not reflect those of Domino's Pizza. We apologize for how poorly this reflects on our local stores and we assure you corrective action will be taken as the franchise owner determines,' read the statement.
