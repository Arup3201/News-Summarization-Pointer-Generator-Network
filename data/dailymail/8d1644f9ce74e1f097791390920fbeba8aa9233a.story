Lauren Silverman, the married New York socialite expecting Simon Cowell's baby, had to wait over a year and a half to divorce her husband, sources say.

According to a report in The New York Post, Silverman, 36, was holding off on breaking the news about her affair with Cowell until the 10-year mark in her marriage so the terms of her pre-nup would kick in - awarding her $3 or $4 million.

'This is just another example of her going for the money,' a source from Andrew's camp told the Post.

Friends of the Silvermans told MailOnline that waiting until the decade mark before divorcing was 'more lucrative' for Lauren.

They also said that Andrew's parents didn't attend their wedding because 'they did not approve of the relationship, they didn't have a good feeling about her and the relationship.'

The friends also said they were 'aware of the rumors of other conquests by Lauren.'

The Silvermans plan to make their split official early this week.

Scrutiny: Silverman wore sunglasses while shopping after it emerged she is pregnant with Cowell's baby

Yesterday, Silverman looked despondent today as she took a break from the crisis talks with her husband to buy some toys for her son.

Mrs Silverman, who is pregnant with Simon Cowell's baby, put her hands on the counter of the toy store and stared into space - looking like she had a weight on her shoulders.

Her stare was only broken when she saw her son Adam, seven, come to her side and she broke into a smile and stared at him.

Lauren had taken Adam away from her $4million home in Bridgehampton, New York as a break from crisis talks with her husband Andrew on her affair with Cowell.

They left around 10am in a Range Rover being driven by her handler and drove for five minutes to a nearby shopping center where they went into a shop called Second Star Toys.

Lauren browsed for a few minutes before taking a large box of Legos to the counter.

She could be heard apologizing to staff for all the attention she was getting and was led out the back door where the Range Rover was waiting.

Lauren was dressed casually in a loose fitting white shirt with a red pattern on it, dark-colored shorts and tan gladiator sandals.
