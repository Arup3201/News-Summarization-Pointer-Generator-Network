It is a race in which loyalty and sacrifice come to the fore.

But the sportsmanship exhibited by the  riders has failed to rub off on to their wives and girlfriends.

During the final days of the Tour de France, the partners of Bradley Wiggins and teammate Chris Froome became involved an unseemly spat.

Michelle Cound (pictured with boyfriend Chris Froome) took to Twitter to criticise his treatment during the Tour

The row erupted at the end of the 
11th stage of the race when Froome was ordered to slow down to allow 
Wiggins to catch up and retain the overall lead.

The
tactic prompted an extraordinary outburst from Froome’s girlfriend, 
Michelle Cound, a South African sports photographer. In a thinly veiled 
jibe, she tweeted: ‘Teamwork is also about giving the people around you,
that support you, a chance to shine in their own right.’

Ms Cound and Mrs Wiggins exchanged thinly-veiled jibes on Twitter

Mrs Wiggins quickly shot a Tweet back in response which praised other members of the Sky Team Mick Rogers and Richie Porte for 'genuine, selfless effort and true professionalism' -  but omitted Mr Froome.

This Tweet led to an immediate response from Ms Cound who replied: 'Don't think there are many other pro-riders who's partners know more about cycling than Chris's precisely & I know what happened just then.'

'If you want loyalty, get a Froome dog a quality I value although being taken advantage of by others!'

The spat was joined by Peta Todd, partner of Mark Cavendish, one of Wiggins’s other teammates.

The former topless model wrote of Froome: ‘You are a little bit special. Legend.’ No mention was made of Wiggins.

The tension does not seem to have ruffled Mr Wiggins however, as he takes a lead of two minutes and five seconds  over his competitors into the final stage.

He
has expressed support for Mr Froomes who he said 'will have his day.' 
The 27-year-old rider is highly rated and tipped as a future winner of 
the Tour.

Mr Wiggins, a 32-year-old Londoner, has won three Olympic
gold medals on an indoor track, and is expected to increase that tally 
at the Games next month.

In his autobiography the cyclist has spoken movingly of his troubled relationship with this Australian father, who was also a gifted road racer.
