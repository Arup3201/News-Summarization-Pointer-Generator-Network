A foul-mouthed pensioner branded 'Britain's nastiest granny' for making her neighbours' lives hell during a 12-year harassment campaign was given an ASBO today.

Joan Nisbet, 71, sprayed weedkiller in a woman's face, blared gangster rap music, took part in naked sex acts and drove one neighbour to the brink of suicide.

Nisbet was today handed an interim ASBO, after Croydon Coucnil ruled that the restraining order she received in September was ‘insufficient’ to protect her neighbours in Kenley, Surrey, from her abusive behaviour.

In an unprecedented move, Croydon Council in Surrey have also applied to place a closure order on her home in Kenley - a procedure normally used for shutting down drug dens.

'She's a nightmare': Joan Nisbet (above) faces being evicted from her Croydon home after waging a 12-year campaign of harassment against her neighbours

Nisbet, currently serving a four-month prison sentence for breaching a restraining order in January, appeared in court on May 1 as the council applied to have her evicted from her home for three months.

Today’s ASBO bans her from causing harassment, alarm or distress to her neighbours and from assaulting or threatening them when she is released this Friday.

She has been barred from contacting next door neighbours Lorraine and Paul Crowley directly or indirectly.

Nisbet, who sat impassively as she was read out the sanctions is also forbidden from pestering those who gave information about her campaign of abuse.

Campaign of harassment: Police visit Nisbet's home in Kenley to arrest her last year. She was given a suspended jail term after a trial in September

She is also forbidden from shouting or swearing or verbally abusing neighbours, playing music which can be heard outside her home or banging on its walls.

The interim ASBO runs until August 14, when Croydon Council will apply to have it formally recognised.

Prosecutor Kuljit Bhogal said the current restraining order against Nisbet was ‘not sufficient to ensure that she behaves appropriately.’

She said: 'The position today is that Miss Nisbet is here and the local authority seek to pursue an authority for an ASBO.

'This is because the local authority take the view that as Miss Nisbet has been detained in prison there has been respite for the community and there is not a need to close her home and prevent her from living there.

'What we seek is an order concerning her behaviour when she is released on June 15. All of these matters have been served on Miss Nisbet prior to May 1.'

'We
are also applying for an antisocial behaviour order which would prevent
her from visiting her own or her neighbours’ homes in Kenley.'

During her 12-year campaign, she:

In September, she was hit with a 
suspended jail sentence and a restraining order  – but was hauled back 
in front of judges after she viciously mocked Mr Crowley for trying to commit suicide.

Torment: Lorraine Crowley says she had weedkiller sprayed in her face by Nisbet

At her trial in September, Mrs Crowley, 54, told Croydon Magistrates Court: ‘She is evil. The past year has been hell. She terrorised the whole neighbourhood, insulting the children and playing music so loud you could hear it all down the road.'

Mrs Bignell later added: 'The 12 years of living next to her have been a living hell.

'It is about time the council acted. I hope she has her house taken away from her permanently. She does not deserve one.

'She is a nightmare, so we are glad the council are now doing something about it.'
