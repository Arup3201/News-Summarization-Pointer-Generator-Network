The U.S. has insisted that it will not allow Iran to choke off one of the world's busiest shipping routes in revenge for sanctions imposed on the country over its secretive nuclear programme.

Last night an American military official said that 'any disruption will not be tolerated' in the Strait of Hormuz, which is used by 40 per cent of the world's oil tankers, and where Iran is currently holding a 10-day war games training exercise.

And a Pentagon spokesman warned that Iran would destroy its own 'economic lifeline' if it disrupted the international oil trade.

Tensions rose after Iran’s top naval commander bragged that shutting down the Gulf to oil tankers would be ‘easier than drinking a glass of water.’

And they have continued to escalate today, with Iran revealing one of its surveillance planes has recorded video and photographed a U.S. aircraft carrier near the area it is carrying out the drill.

Drill: Iran is holding a 10-day military exercise in international waters beyond the Strait of Hormuz - the passageway for one-sixth of the world's oil supply

Training: The military drill has sparked a row between Iran and the U.S.

The report did not provide details and 
it was unclear what information the Iranian military could gleam from 
such footage.

But the announcement was seen as an indication Iran is 
seeking to cast its navy as having a powerful role in the region's 
waters.

The threats have triggered an angry response 
from the U.S. Fifth Fleet, based in Bahrain.

‘Anyone who threatens to disrupt 
freedom of navigation in an international strait is clearly outside the 
community of nations; any disruption will not be tolerated,’ said a 
spokesman for the Bahrain-based fleet.

‘The free flow of goods and services 
through the Strait of Hormuz is vital to regional and global 
prosperity,’ he added.

Britain dismissed the Iranian boasts as an attempt to draw attention from its nuclear ambitions.

If Iran were successfully to block access to the Strait of Hormuz, the price of crude oil would almost certainly rise dramatically.

Around a third of all oil shipped in tankers passes through the strait, and if this supply were disrupted it would out immense pressure on the rest of the world's supplies.

Following a mistaken report that the strait had already been closed, the oil price jumped by $2, to over $100 a barrel.

Although it then fell back, the price is set to rise even if the Strait of Hormuz remains open, as sanctions on Iran and Syria restrict the global supply.

A senior Saudi official has insisted that Gulf nations will be able to make up for any shortfall caused by the sanctions, but this would be of little use if Iran succeeded in cutting off the strait.

The ongoing uncertainty is set to make 2012 another volatile year for the oil markets, following the disruption to supplies caused by the Arab Spring throughout 2011.

Playing down the threat, a Foreign 
Office spokesman said: ‘Iranian politicians regularly use this type of 
rhetoric to distract attention from the real issue, which is the nature 
of their nuclear programme.’

Tehran warned a week ago it would shut down the strategically vital shipping lane if the West took tougher action against Iran.

Vice President Mohammad Reza Rahimi said Iran wouldn’t allow ‘a drop of oil’ to pass through the strait if sanctions were widened.

The row ratcheted up another notch after Admiral Habibollah Sayyari, head of the Iranian navy, declared that ‘closing the Strait of Hormuz for Iran’ s armed forces is really easy – or as Iranians say it will be easier than drinking a glass of water.’

The comments drew a quick response from the U.S, with Pentagon press secretary George Little saying: 'This
is not just an important issue for security and stability in the 
region, but is an economic lifeline for countries in the Gulf, to 
include Iran.'

Iranian media have described how Iran could move to close the strait, saying the country would use a combination of warships, submarines, speed boats, anti-ship cruise missiles, torpedoes, surface-to-sea missiles and drones to stop ships from sailing through the narrow waterway.

Iran's navy claims it has sonar-evading submarines designed for shallow waters of the Persian Gulf, enabling it to hit passing enemy vessels.

A closure of the strait could temporarily cut off some oil supplies and force shippers to take longer, more expensive routes that would drive oil prices higher. It also potentially opens the door for a military confrontation that would further rattle global oil markets.

But
Mark Toner, spokesperson for the U.S. State Department, responded: 
'It's another attempt to distract attention away from the real issue, 
which is their continued non-compliance with their international nuclear
obligations.'

Western tensions 
with Iran have increased since a U.N report claimed last month that 
Tehran appears to have worked on designing an atomic bomb.

Iran strongly denies this and insists it is developing nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.

The possibility of imposing sanctions on Iran has divided U.N members.

Iran
has defiantly expanded nuclear activity despite four rounds of U.N. 
sanctions meted out since 2006 over its refusal to suspend sensitive 
uranium enrichment.

Many
diplomats believe only sanctions targeting Iran's lifeblood oil sector 
might be painful enough to make it change course, but Russia and China -
big trade partners of Tehran - have blocked such a move at the United 
Nations.

The U.S. Congress has passed a 
bill banning dealings with the Iran Central Bank, and President Barack 
Obama has said he will sign it despite his misgivings. Critics warn it 
could impose hardships on U.S. allies and drive up oil prices.

The
bill could impose penalties on foreign firms that do business with 
Iran's central bank. European and Asian nations import Iranian oil and 
use its central bank for the transactions.

The threats to close the Strait of Hormuz coincided with a 10-day Iranian naval exercise in the Strait and
nearby waters, a show of military force that began on Saturday.

'Our enemies will give up on their plots against Iran only if we give them a firm and strong lesson,' Mr Rahimi said.

Important: Around a third of the world's shipped oil passes through the Strait of Hormuz

Around a third of all shipped 
oil passes through the four mile-wide Strait between Oman and Iran and 
U.S. warships patrol the area to ensure safe passage.

Former U.S. Vice-President Dick Cheney said President Obama should have 
ordered an airstrike over Iran after their refusal to hand back the 
unmanned spy plane that crashed last month

Most
of the crude exported from Saudi Arabia, Iran, the United Arab 
Emirates, Kuwait and Iraq - together with nearly all the liquefied 
natural gas from lead exporter Qatar is transported through the channel.

After
a news agency mistakenly reported the strait had already been closed,
crude oil prices leapt by almost $2 to $100.45/per barrel, but they 
later stabilised.

Last 
month, Iran's energy minister told Al Jazeera that Tehran could use oil 
as a political tool in the event of any future conflict over its nuclear
program.

Tensions over the
program have increased since the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) reported on November 8 that Tehran appears to have worked on 
designing a nuclear bomb and may still be pursuing research to that end.

Iran has warned it 
will respond to any attack by hitting Israel and U.S. interests in the 
Gulf and analysts say one way to retaliate would be to close the Strait 
of Hormuz.

Last month former
U.S. Vice-President Dick Cheney said President Obama should have 
ordered an airstrike over Iran after their refusal to hand back the 
unmanned spyplane that crashed in November.

During
a White House news conference with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri 
al-Maliki, Mr Obama said: 'We have asked for it back. We'll see how the 
Iranians respond.'

But Mr Cheney told CNN: 'The right response would have been to go in immediately after it had gone down and destroy it.'
