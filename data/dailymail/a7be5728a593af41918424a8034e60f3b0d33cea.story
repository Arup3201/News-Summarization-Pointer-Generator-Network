Witnessing a meteor blaze across the night sky is awe-inspiring. So is seeing a comet, nebula or star cluster .

But what if you could see all of them, at the same time, in the same image of the cosmos?

That’s the amazing celestial montage apparent in this stunning long-exposure photograph, showing various  phenomenon alongside some of their more Earthly companions.

Use slider below to reveal the space phenomena

In the centre of the image is Comet Lovejoy, which made its closest pass to Earth in January 2015. Elsewhere a nebula shaped like the state of California and another surrounding a runaway star are seen. Move the slider to switch between the annotated and blank image

The image, released by the European Southern Observatory (ESO), was taken above the La Silla Observatory, on the outskirts of the Chilean Atacama Desert. It was captured by Photo Ambassaador Petr Horálek during a visit to La Silla in January 2015.

Using a series of long exposures, he snapped the stunning views of both the observatory and the celestial objects above.

- A meteor

- Comet Lovejoy

- The Pleiades star cluster

- The California Nebula

- The Pan-American Highway

- The Flaming Star Nebula

- Oxygen airglow in the upper atmosphere

- Low altitude clouds

- La Silla Observatory 

Towards the centre of the night sky in the image is a green object, Comet Lovejoy.

Formally designated C/2014 Q2, it was discovered by Australian astronomer Terry Lovejoy and made its closest approach to Earth on 7 January.

On this day it was just 43.6 million miles (70.2 million km) from Earth, and was captured in amazing images by astronomers all over the world.

The comet appears green because its atoms and molecules are ionised and give off a specific wavelength of light - like a neon sign.

In this instance with the comet, it is due to the molecules cyanogen and diatomic carbon, which both glow green.

To the naked eye, though, the comet will appear grey; it is only cameras using a long exposure that bring out its green colouration.

The comet is of particular interest because it is a 'long period' comet - one that originates from the outermost reaches of the solar system, the Oort cloud.

To the left of the comet in the image is an unnamed meteor burning up in the atmosphere.

The European Southern Observatory has revealed this amazing image taken above an observatory in Chile. The montage reveals many different cosmic phenomena above the La Silla Observatory

Every day about 100 tons of meteoroids, which are fragments of dust and gravel and sometimes even big rocks, enter Earth’s atmosphere.

When these burn up in the atmosphere they can produce a brief streak of light, which becomes known as a meteor. On rare occasions the meteor will make it to Earth’s surface, when it becomes known as a meteorite.

Recently, many scientists have said we should do more to track incoming space rocks, and prevent a potential catastrophe if a big enough rock makes it to the ground.

In 2011, for example, a previously unseen meteor passed through the atmosphere and exploded above the Russian town of Chelyabinsk. The resultant shockwave injured hundreds of people and damaged many buildings.

Built and operated by the European Southern Observatory, the La Silla Observatory has several telescopes and is located 93 miles (150km) northeast of La Serena, on the outskirts of the Chilean Atacama Desert

Formally designated C/2014 Q2, Comet Lovejoy (shown) was discovered by Australian astronomer Terry Lovejoy and made its closest approach to Earth on 7 January. On this day it was just 43.6 million miles (70.2 million km) from Earth, and was captured in amazing images by astronomers all over the world

In a chance encounter, the image also revealed a meteor burning up in the atmosphere. Every day about 100 tons of meteoroids, which are fragments of dust and gravel and sometimes even big rocks, enter Earth’s atmosphere

Just up and to the right of the comet is a very famous star cluster known as the Pleiades, also called Seven Sisters, and designated Messier 45 (M45).

At a distance of about 444 light-years, it is the closest star cluster to Earth and can even be seen with the naked eye.

The cluster is predominantly made of middle-aged and extremely luminous stars, which formed within the last 100 million years.

Astronomers have estimated that within 250 million years the cluster will disperse, due to gravitational interactions with the galactic neighbourhood.

Also visible (long-exposure shot on the left) is the famous star cluster known as Pleiades, also known as Seven Sisters, and designated Messier 45 (M45). At a distance of about 444 light-years, it is the closest star cluster to Earth and can even be seen with the naked eye. On the right is a color-composite image of the Pleiades from the Digitized Sky Survey

Directly to the right of the comet is a red arc that appears to somewhat resemble the shape of the state of California.

For that reason this arc, which is actually the nebula NGC 1499 stretching up to 100 light-years in length, is called the California Nebula.

It is an emission nebula, which means that its gases or most likely lit up by high-energy photons emitted from a nearby hot star - in this case an energetic star called xi Persei.

It is located about 1,000 light-years from Earth and is usually very difficult to see in the night sky, except with long-exposure photographs like this.

In the main image can also be seen a nebula somewhat shaped like the state of California, left, earning it the name the California Nebula. On the right is an infrared image of the nebula from Nasa's Wise (Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer) telescope

In the top right of the image is a red blur that is even further from Earth, known as IC 405 or the Flaming Star Nebula.

It is also an emission nebula, which surrounds a blue star known as AE Aurigae.

The nebula itself is about five light-years across, but it is located 1,500 light-years from Earth.

Interestingly, the star itself may have once originated near Orion’s Belt, the famous collection of three stars in the constellation of Orion.

The star has since been ejected, though, and is now referred to as a runway star.

This was possibly caused by the collision of two groups of binary stars two million years ago in the nearby Trapezium cluster, which may have caused a supernova that knocked AE Aurigae into space.

The other objects of interest in the image include the green glow seen on the horizon in the distance.

Known as airglow, this results from oxygen atoms becoming ‘excited' in the atmosphere, which then emit a green light.

The atoms extend about 56 to 62 miles (90 to 100km) into the atmosphere.

In the distance is the Pan-American Highway, which is a network of roads that measures a huge 30,000 miles (48,000 kilometres) in length.

It links all the mainland nations of the Americas, stretching from Prudhoe Bay in Alaska to Ushuaia in Argentina - although the road is not continuous or official in places.

And, of course, the image is also dominated by the remarkably La Silla Observatory in the foreground.

Built and operated by the European Southern Observatory, the site has several telescopes and is located 93 miles (150km) northeast of La Serena, on the outskirts of the Chilean Atacama Desert.

This is one of the driest and remotest areas of the world, meaning the site is free from light pollution and has fantastic views of the cosmos through a clear atmosphere.

And, for that reason, even comparatively simple long-exposure images like this are able to unveil many hidden secrets of the universe.
