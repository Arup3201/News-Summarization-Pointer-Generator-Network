SAS sniper Sergeant Danny Nightingale could be back on the Afghan frontline within months.

He is determined to return to the Special Forces regiment after winning a legal battle last week.

Sergeant Nightingale, 37, was freed by Appeal Court judges on Thursday after widespread outrage over an 18-month sentence for illegally possessing a pistol and ammunition.

The punishment was cut to 12 months and suspended, allowing him to return home.

He is now fighting to clear his name by overturning the conviction, while weighing up his military career options.

Sitting with his wife Sally, 38, and their two daughters Mara, five, and Alys, two, Sergeant Nightingale said: ‘I want to get my good name back and I want to return to my regiment.

‘I’m still proud to have been a member of the SAS. It has always been the pinnacle of my career.’

He is expected to have talks with his commanders over the publicity surrounding his case.

The SAS is a notoriously secretive unit with members fiercely protecting their identities so they are not compromised on top secret operations.

Sergeant Nightingale’s name and face have been splashed across television screens, newspapers and websites.

Once a soldier is ‘outed’, their career with the elite regiment is almost certainly at an end. But Sergeant Nightingale could return to his old unit – the Duke of Lancaster’s Regiment – for a two-month ‘cooling off’ period and he is trained as a combat medic.

If that happens he could be deployed to Helmand next March. However, if he fails to quash his conviction he could be discharged from the Army under the Queen’s Regulations.

Sergeant Nightingale, who has served with valour in Iraq and Afghanistan, was sent to a military prison in Colchester three weeks ago after pleading guilty to possessing a working 9mm Glock pistol and more than 300 rounds of ammunition at his quarters in Hereford.

The weapon was a souvenir from Iraqi soldiers but the SAS sniper forgot he had it when he suffered ‘significant’ brain damage after collapsing on a charity trek in the Brazilian jungle.

He admitted two charges at the court martial in November.

But his legal team argued at the Royal Courts of Justice in London that the ‘exemplary’ soldier was pressured into pleading guilty after the trial judge hinted he would receive five years in a civilian jail if he fought the case.

More than 107,000 signed a petition demanding his release and Prime Minister David Cameron expressed sympathy.

Speaking about his detention, Sergeant
Nighingale said: ‘I didn’t sleep for that first night. I laid awake 
wondering how the children would cope, how my wife would manage on her 
own.

‘But I also realised I 
had to be very professional. I did everything that was asked of me. I 
mopped floors, stood to attention on parade, was always polite and 
respectful.

‘I offered my 
services to help train some of the younger soldiers and I even taught a 
young lad how to fire a pistol. I love training: I get a real kick out 
of seeing people achieve goals.’

Thanking
the public for their support, he said: ‘A pensioner sent a pound. 
Another person sent a £3 postal order and they apologised for not giving
me any more – it was simply amazing.’
