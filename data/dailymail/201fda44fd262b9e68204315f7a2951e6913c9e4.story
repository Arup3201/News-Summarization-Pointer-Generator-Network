Everton manager Roberto Martinez relishes the prospect of facing Arsenal because they are not a 'parasite' on the Premier League with their approach to matches like some teams they face.

Martinez shares a similar football philosophy to Arsenal counterpart Arsene Wenger, who he will attempt to outwit at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday afternoon.

And the Spaniard also believes players prefer to work under the likes of himself and Wenger because the style of play of their teams.

'Too many times you see a team that go for being a parasite; they give you the ball, defend, be destructive,' Martinez said.

'That system doesn't develop players. It's the opposite – every two years they burn players. They need new players and they need new players to do things players don't enjoy doing.

'I believe the way the game should be played is in a specific manner; taking risks, and getting on the ball and relying on the talent of the players to score goals.'

Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has been criticised for his team's style of play this season, while Jose Mourinho's Chelsea teams have been dubbed anti-football in the past.

Wenger lambasted Tony Pulis, when he was Stoke manager, for 'rugby' tactics while the Frenchman also had rows with Sam Allardyce and Martin O'Neill among others.

However, Martinez was decidedly more cautious when asked which managers or teams he was referring to with his parasite comments.

He added: 'Unfortunately you get too many managers achieving success with another type of football.

'Who? I am sure you can figure it out! You can analyse teams over history, and there are parasite teams.

'Our team is as good as it could be in terms of human quality and the quality that we've got football-wise.' 

Meanwhile, Martinez has told Belgium winger Kevin Mirallas, who has been linked with a move away from Goodison Park, that he must remain patient over a new contract.

Mirallas is understood to want to open negotiations over improved terms but must bide his time.

'Are we in talks? Not at the moment,' Martinez explained. 'We're going to leave every individual situation until further down the line.

'I do feel that talking about individual situations can be distracting at this point.

'We'll look at the players who are out of contract first and foremost because they're more urgent but players like Kevin Mirallas who has two-and-a-half years left on his contract is not something we need to consider yet.'
