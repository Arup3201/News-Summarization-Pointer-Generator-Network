Arsenal’s annual shareholders meeting becomes more frustrating by the year with the board now choosing which fans’ questions they answer, while deflecting the contentious issues.

So Arsenal’s catering and cleaning contractors paying Emirates workers less than the hourly London living wage was a matter for the Government according to the club, who could easily deal only with companies which pay a London rate. And there was no detail about the exact advisory role carried out by owner Stan Kroenke’s company Kroenke Sport Entertainment, for which the club paid out over £3m.

Meanwhile, the reasons given for Kroenke’s son Josh joining the board were his experience in leadership roles gained with various sports teams in the US — all owned by his father. And chairman Sir Chips Keswick didn’t count the number of shareholders who voted against Josh joining the board, though it looked remarkably close to the amount in favour.

Finally Sir Chips brushed away a highly relevant question from respected horse racing figure Nigel Payne about Arsene Wenger not buying a defender in the summer. 

Grandee Keswick said the board gave the manager, who didn’t want to answer, 100 per cent backing on all football matters whether he had a plan or not.

Owner Kroenke mumbled a few platitudes as well as saying the shareholders summit was an ‘unusual environment.’

There is increasing likelihood that the next Premier League TV rights tender — to be unveiled around the New Year — will include an extra eighth package to show Sunday night football, as revealed by Sports Agenda. 

And the slot, which already has the informal support of the top clubs —well aware that it could add at least another £600m to their coffers — could easily become the most valuable. There will be problems over transport and further diluting the Saturday afternoon programme but money always talks loudest in the Premier League.

The Class of 92 have now become such a commercial entity that agency Wasserman Media Group, who represent Ryan Giggs and Gary and Phil Neville, are now acting for all five of the Manchester United group on some projects.

The MCC civil war over their botched rebuilding programme now sees various high-profile members including David Gower, Sir Ian Magee, Sir Simon Robertson, Sir David Metcalf and Lord Grabiner seeking support for another SGM to pass a vote of no confidence in chairman Oliver Stocken. But the grandees’ case is hardly helped by their other supporters, including members such as Paddy Briggs, who agitated for a previous costly SGM which he didn’t bother to attend.

Clive Efford, Labour’s Shadow sports minister, is announcing his party’s proposal to enable at least two fans to be on every football club board and have the right to purchase up to 10 per cent of the shares when a club changes ownership.

Efford says the fanciful policy — seriously over-hyped as the ‘biggest legislative shake-up in the governance of English and Welsh football clubs since the advent of the game’ — will form part of the election manifesto with legislation during the first term of a Labour Government.

At least Efford is making a statement about his intentions for football in contrast to useless Minister for Sport Helen Grant, who has steered clear of football matters since a quiz ambush in which she couldn’t name the FA Cup holders.

Minister for Sport Helen Grant did not know who the holders of the FA Cup were in November 2013

The weekend bestseller lists will show the biggest two book sales were for the Roy Keane and Kevin Pietersen stories — not surprising given the publicity surrounding both publications. 

Keane’s account sold around 21,000 hardback copies in its first week with Pietersen in second place with over 19,000. Keane seems to be enjoying promotional tours more than KP. The day after Republic of Ireland gained a draw against Germany, Irish assistant boss Keane went down a storm addressing the Tesco autumn sales conference.
