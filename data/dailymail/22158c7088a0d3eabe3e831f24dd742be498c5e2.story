A homeless family of four who claim they cannot afford to rent privately have been sleeping in a car for a year because the council won't give them a house.

Norman Karawaiez, 61, and his wife Carole, 56, kip in the silver Toyota Avensis together with their son Lewis, 21, and daughter Lamase, 20.

The couple applied to be added to Bexley Council's housing register last September but they received a letter last week to say they do not fulfill the criteria because they do not have a proof of address for the past two years.

The couple had their home in Sidcup, Kent, repossessed 10 years ago, and split up.

Mrs Karawaiez, who is not entitled to benefits, and her children went to live with a cousin while Mr Karawaiez began living in his car which he also drives as a minicab. 

They got back together a year ago and have been sleeping in the car ever since.

Mrs Karawaiez said: 'It's a nightmare. Me and my daughter lie at the back and my husband and son sleep in the front of the car.

Bexley Council says the family does not meet criteria for a council house despite them sleeping in a car

'I can't remember the last time I had a good night's sleep. We're constantly bickering at each other.'

The
 former carer and mother-of-four says she has a shower at her other 
daughter Leila's house and is picked up by her husband when 
he finishes work at around 1am.

She says the situation has taken its toll on their close-knit family, particularly her youngest daughter Lamase.

She said: 'My husband's quite used to it as he's done it for the past 10 years or so but my son and daughter are getting really stressed. 

'They're 21 and 20 but they act quite young for their age. 

'My youngest took an overdose of prescription pills about three months ago and she's now waiting to go to counselling.'

Mrs Karawaiez, who suffers from depression, says she can't work at the moment due to lack of sleep and not having a proper home.

The family live off the income from Mr Karawaiez, who earns around £300 week working seven days a week at the Station Road minicab firm.

Son Lewis, 21, is training to become a hairdresser at the Barber Shop Cafe in Welling High Street and takes home £50 a week.

The family lived together in Sidcup before the house was repossessed because they couldn't afford to pay the mortgage after Mr Karawaiez was made redundant from his job at a magazine company in central London.

Around six months later she moved to Plumstead where she lived until the summer of last year before getting back together with her husband.

Bexley Council said: 'The family is comprised of a husband, wife and two children aged 20 and 21, both of whom are working.

'The family approached the service in
 April this year and were advised that they should look to find private 
rented accommodation as they are unlikely to be classed as in priority 
need in light of the children being adults and both working. 

'The
 council has made a commitment to prioritise established Bexley families
 in their allocations policy, which means having lived continuously in 
the borough for two years at the point of application.

The couple got back together last year but the family have been sleeping in the car ever since

'As this is not the case with this family it is not possible to accept a housing application from them at this stage. 

'Social housing is in short supply and the Council must look at the evidence of each case very closely as things are not always as they seem. It is the Council's duty to ensure that it gets value for money for its taxpayers and that those with the most need are prioritised.'

In spite of the council's comment, the Karawaiez family say Lamase is not in work.
