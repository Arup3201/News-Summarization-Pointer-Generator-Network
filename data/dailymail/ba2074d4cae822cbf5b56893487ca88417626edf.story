Tragic: Toddler James Curtis, three, was killed after being hit by a fireplace in Birkenhead, Merseyside

A heartbroken family today paid tribute to their three-year-old boy who died after a marble fireplace fell on him.

James Curtis was described as 'my whole world' by his grief-stricken mother, following his death after the tragic incident at the family's home in Birkenhead, Merseyside, yesterday morning.

It's understood a marble fireplace in the living room of the house had collapsed on top of him. James was taken to hospital but later died.

His distraught mother Charlotte Edwards said on Facebook: 'Words cannot describe how much love I have for him and always will.

'You will always be my number one boy and always be in my heart, absolutely devastated. James Stuart Curtis, my whole world, is now in heaven with my nan. I will see you again soon baby. RIP - love you millions.'

In another post, she added: 'James was, and still is, loved by millions - and he loved every single person he met. We are who we are today because of our little boy and the past nearly-four years have been the best of our life. My whole world and my hero.'

Miss Edwards told her friends and family that she felt like she was living a ‘horrible dream’.

She said: ‘Lying on the sofa with my baby's favourite, absolutely heartbroken and don't know what to do with myself. Can someone punch me so I wake up from this horrible, horrible dream please?’

Neighbours described how she had run out of the house and repeatedly screamed James's name in the front garden.

One said: 'I'd never heard anyone 
screaming like that so I knew something bad had happened. Then I 
realised she was screaming the child's name.'

Tributes to James were also paid by friends of Miss Edwards and James's father Nic Curtis on their Facebook pages.

Katie Patient wrote: 'RIP little man - 
heaven gained another beautiful angel. Sleep tight, sweet dreams - my 
thoughts and prayers are with all the family at this sad time.'

Another friend, Terri Goode, posted: 'Oh my God Charl. Can't believe it. The world's lost such a happy little boy.'

Facebook page of times playing at the park and pulling faces to the 
camera.

to let you know how sorry I am for you both. Your little man will be 
looking down on you both every day.

'Hope you're both as OK as can be at 
this time. God only takes the best.’
