Olympic gold medalist Bode Miller has lost custody of a baby boy the mother claimed he tried to make her abort.

A Manhattan court overturned an earlier family court decision on Friday, and ruled that the nine-month-old baby should not have been sent to live with the skier in California.

Miller has been locked in a custody dispute with his former lover Sara McKenna, since their son was born in February.

Overruled: Bode Miller with his son. A Manhattan court ruled that the baby should not have been sent to California to live with his father

McKenna, a former marine, had previously claimed that the skier had suggested she have an abortion. according to the New York Daily News.

When she first told Miller of the pregnancy, he texted her: 'U are going to do this on your own.'

Moving on: Sara McKenna moved to New York while pregnant

The 35-year-old
skier later pushed for joint custody, and a judge ruled that McKenna 
must return to California for the case, forcing her to give up her 
studies at Columbia University in New York.

A family court referee at an earlier hearing had described McKenna as 'reprehensible' for moving to New York while pregnant.

After a short fling with Miller, the former Marine had moved to New York to study at Columbia under the GI Bill.

The 27-year-old has applied for temporary custody of the baby, which she named Samuel.

She claimed that when the couple met through a dating website, Miller had said he wanted a large family with her.

McKenna revealed the couple had sex only twice
- and that Miller failed to use protection as he assumed she was ready 
to get pregnant, she said.

'You have to agree to have four of my babies,' Miller had texted McKenna, she told the New York Daily News.

After
they met in California, they went their separate ways, and she said he 
was reluctant to continue a relationship because he wanted a large 
family, and she did not.

But a few weeks later, they arranged to meet in Florida - and a second tryst led to her becoming pregnant with Samuel.

'He never offered to use a condom,' McKenna said. 'He assumed I was ready to get pregnant.'

While pregnant, she moved to New York - and Miller, who has five Olympic medals, married volleyball player Morgan Beck.

Beck and Miller married in October 2012 and announced they were expecting a child, but Beck had a miscarriage in January.

Days after the devastating
news, Miller filed court documents to gain joint custody of his son with 
McKenna.

Baby Bode: McKenna discovered she was pregnant after a short relationship with Miller

Miller sought to force a 
judge to get McKenna to move back to California, so he could have 
a relationship with the child. He also sought to have the boy's last name changed to Miller on his birth certificate.

At a hearing earlier this year, the lawyer representing McKenna said it is too late for Miller to try to seek joint custody.Â 

'If
you look at the texts [messages] from Bode Miller to my client, he 
wanted nothing to do with the baby,' attorney Kenneth Eiges said.

Her lawyer also defended his client's decision to live in New York saying it was 'her right'.
