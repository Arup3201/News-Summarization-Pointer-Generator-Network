Road rage usually occurs when cars are in motion, but one 68-year-old man in Winter Haven, Florida was arrested over the weekend for getting into a fight with another driver stopped in a McDonald's drive-thru.

Howard Carl Wilson was sitting in his truck in the right lane of the McDonald's drive-thru around 11:20pm Saturday when a car in the left ordering land drove past him and ahead to the next window.

Thinking he was getting cut off, Wilson got out of his car and confronted Brittani Thomas who was sitting in the passenger seat.

Was that necessary? Camera phone footage shows the moment Howard Wilson punched Brittani Thomas in a road rage incident in a McDonald's drive-thru this weekend in Florida

Booked: Wilson was arrested and charged with simple battery following the incident on Saturday

Meanwhile, people in a car behind Wilson took video of the incident on their phones and witnesses reported the man yelling profanities and racial slurs into Thomas' car.

At one point Thomas opens the door to ask what Wilson's problem is, and the two continue to argue for two minutes.

During the argument Thomas tries to close the door several times, but Wilson blocked it every time.

Eventually Wilson reaches his arm into the car to punch Thomas and then walks back to his car and out of the drive-thru.

The person recording the altercation 
took down Wilson's license plate number and officers later showed up to 
the home where he admitted to being at the McDonald's that night.

However,
 Wilson initially told cops he was only at the car for 15 seconds and 
that he was angry that the driver almost cut him off.

When officers showed him the video, Wilson admitted that the 'situation was much more than he recalled'.

'It was like a road rage incident,' Wilson told authorities.

Wilson was charged with simple battery and booked at the Polk County Jail but has since been released.
