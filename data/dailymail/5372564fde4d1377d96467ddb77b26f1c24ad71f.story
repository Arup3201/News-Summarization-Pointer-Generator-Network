Japanese cars are set to become a lot cheaper for Australian consumers after Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe sign an economic partnership agreement.

Mr Abe and wife Akie arrived in Canberra on Monday night for the first bilateral visit by a Japanese leader in 12 years.

He addressed parliament on Tuesday and will sign the free-trade agreement along with a new deal to transfer defence equipment and technology. Japan is Australia's second-biggest trading partner.

International trade expert Alan Oxley said the main benefit for Australian consumers would be the reduced cost of Japanese cars.

'The government has indicated there's a tariff of 5 to 8 per cent that will come off automobiles,' Mr Oxley, principal of ITS Global, told Daily Mail Australia.

Australian Automobile Association chief Andrew McKellar said Japan was the largest source of imported vehicles in Australia and made up about 30 per cent of the market.

'We would estimate [the trade deal] would reduce the amount of tax payable on a new car by about $1000 to $2000,' Mr McKellar told Daily Mail Australia.

'For a larger vehicle like a [Toyota] Land Cruiser the saving is probably closer to $3000.'

Toyota is the top selling Japanese brand in Australia but Mazda, Nissan, Honda and Subaru also have significant sales in Australia, he said.

Mr Oxley said Japanese electronics and whitegoods are also set to become cheaper, but the tariffs on these goods are much lower than the tariff on cars so the difference will not be as substantial.

Mr Oxley said the relaxation of investment controls will encourage more Japanese investment in Australia, especially in minerals and gas.

'The economy at large will benefit from more Japanese investment,' he said.

The deal is also good news for Australian exporters. The tariff on beef, Australia's biggest export to Japan, will be halved over time delivering an estimated benefit of up to $400 million a year for the local industry.

'We all know Japan's facing some tough economic problems, and they are seeking to try to lower food prices,' Mr Oxley said.

'One way to do that is to reduce tariffs on imports.

'Our cheaper products will go in, and the benefit will spread beyond the Australian beef industry.'

Other beneficiaries will include Australian producers of dairy, sugar, wine, fruit, vegetables and seafood.

Mr Oxley said the new agreement also made it easier for Australian businesses in the service industry to invest and operate in Japan.

'Working in Japan requires having to work very hard to get in sync with their cultural values but there should be great opportunities for legal and investment firms to operate in Japan,' he said.

But Labor is demanding the federal government reveal the detail of its free trade deal with Japan before the agreement is inked.

Opposition trade spokeswoman Penny Wong urged the government to release the full text of the agreement before the 'photo opportunity with the pens and flags'.

'What's the secret?' she told reporters. 'The only information Australians have is a five-page glossy pamphlet.'

Trade Minister Andrew Robb said the full text would be released later this month.

He lauded the deal as the most ambitious trade deal Japan had ever done, pointing out Australia had gotten in first before competitors like the United States.

Mr Robb played down concerns from China about Australia cosying up to Japan, saying it was important to have strong security and trade ties with both Asian powers and South Korea.

Independent senator Nick Xenophon described the deal as a 'costly and secretive folly'.

Australian Bureau of Statistics figures showed past deals signed with Singapore, the United States, Thailand and Chile had led to worsening trade deficits, he said.

'We are taken for mugs by partner countries,' he said.

'We are known overseas as the Free Trade Taliban because of successive Australian governments and bureaucrats having a fundamentalist, literalist approach to free trade.'
