Two brothers dragged a female police officer 100ft down the road when she tried to stop them driving off in a stolen car.

Daniel Icke, 21, and his 20-year-old brother Donovan had never driven before they stole a Ford Escort from outside a house in Wednesfield, West Midlands in December last year.

They were stopped by PC Akwaal Baryana, who reached in to the car to take the keys when they pulled up at traffic lights and told them to get out.

But Donovan, who was driving, ignored her warnings and put the car into reverse as PC Baryana clung on to the steering wheel.

The car careered backwards, crossed a busy dual carriage and crashed into a wall, causing the brave officer serious leg injuries.

Donovan admitted assault causing actual bodily harm, aggravated vehicle taking and driving without a licence or insurance while his brother pleaded guilty to aggravated vehicle taking.

But they were spared jail and given suspended prison sentences when they appeared at Wolverhampton Crown Court yesterday.

Donovan, was given a 12-month prison sentence suspended for two years and ordered to carry out 180 hours of unpaid work.

He was also banned from driving for 12 months and ordered to pay £500 compensation to PC Baryana.

Daniel received a four-month suspended sentence, 120 hours of unpaid work and a 12-month driving ban, and will have to pay £250 compensation.

Recorder Richard Benson QC said he had decided 'with some trepidation' not to send them to prison, adding: 'This was inexcusable and potentially lethal behaviour.

'Some will say I am failing in my duty but they would not have had the benefit of reading the reports I have seen and hearing the mitigation.'

The court heard the brothers took the keys to the car from a home they had broken into at 4am on December 2.

PC Baryana and a colleague responded to the break-in, then spotted the stolen car at a junction 10 minutes later.

Prosecutor Emma Wynne-Owen said: 'She held on to the steering wheel which prevented her being dragged under the car as it travelled for a further 35 metres.

'She pleaded with him to stop but the car continued in reverse, crossing the dual carriageway, mounting the pavement and crashing into a wall.

'The officer then told Donovan Icke, "I told you to stop," and he replied, "sorry".'

Amanda Jenkins, defending the brothers, said: 'Neither had driven before and they argued over who should drive before Donovan stupidly took the wheel.

'They could not believe their luck. It was raining and they had a fair way to go to get home, so very foolishly they took the car.

'When the officer opened the driver's door Donovan panicked and put the vehicle into reverse.

'It swerved because the officer was holding the steering wheel. He did not know what to do but realises it could have been far more serious.'
