Tragic: Father-of-one Justin Feber was drinking a cup of tea when the lightning struck

A father-of-one has been killed after being hit by a bolt of lightning while drinking a cup of tea in a 'freak' one in ten million accident.

Bricklayer Justin Feber's distraught colleagues saw a huge flash and a heard an ear-splitting bang, saying a storm seemed to just appear above them near Crewe, Cheshire.

The 41-year-old, from Haslingden, Lancashire, was not touching anything metallic and was standing with both feet on the ground when he was hit on Wednesday.

As well as his parents Jack and Carol, Mr Feber leaves two brothers, Jason and James, and his six-year-old daughter Libby.

Health and safety experts said today five people on average are killed by lightning each year in the UK - making this tragic fatal strike incredibly rare.

Colleagues of Mr Feber, known as 'Feebs' to his friends, who were sub-contractors at the site by Chorley based Matthews and Leigh Civil Engineering Ltd, rushed to his aid.

But despite further medical attention from paramedics he died a short time later at Leighton Hospital in Crewe. A second man was also taken there suffering shock.

Boss Andy Leigh said: 'All staff at Matthews and Leigh have been profoundly upset and shocked by this tragic event and we send our sincere condolences to Justin's family and friends.

'Justin was well liked, highly professional and held in high regard by all those who worked with him. Our thoughts are with all who knew him at this very sad time.'

The Health and Safety Executive, the body responsible for employee safety in the work place said they had been made aware of the incident and that they would not be launching an investigation.

A HSE spokesman said: 'This incident is not something the Health and Safety Executive would normally investigate because it was the result of a freak natural occurrence.'

A spokesman from Bovis Homes, who run the site, added: 'Everyone at Bovis Homes is deeply saddened by this tragic incident and we extend our sincere sympathies to this man's family and friends.

'Our thoughts are with them and with his colleagues who were with him on site and responded immediately to the incident. They have obviously been deeply affected by this and we will look to support them in any way we can.'

Jason Mahrous, neighbour and friend of Mr Feber said: 'Justin was my next door neighbour.

'All I can say is that he was a great man who loved life and loved his daughter Libby very much.'

Friend Karen King said: 'Justin was a great person who lived life to the full. He was also a great dad, who loved his daughter.

'I was only dancing with him a month or so a go at a 50th birthday party.

'He was a really popular guy who had loads of friends.'

A spokesman from Cheshire Police said: 'At 1.28pm on Wednesday emergency services were called following the report of a man being struck by lightning.

'A 41-year-old man who had been working on a building site was treated by paramedics at the scene.

'Sadly, he died a short time later at Leighton Hospital. A second man suffering from shock was also taken to Leighton.

'Police attended the scene and confirmed there were no suspicious circumstances.'

The Cheshire Coroner is expected to open an inquest on Monday.
