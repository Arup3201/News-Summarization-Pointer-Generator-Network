From the erratic football act once dubbed ‘The Walking Foul’ by former boss Paul Sturrock, here was ‘The Diving Headbutt’.

Bilel Mohsni was sent off for a crazed lunge at two-goal Scotland international Chris Martin with 14 minutes to go as the defender’s temper flared up in friendly action.

Martin appeared to barge late into Mohsni and, as both players were lifting themselves off the turf, the Rangers man sought revenge by launching himself head-first to slam into the Derby striker’s side.

Marching orders: Bilel Mohsni was sent off for an alleged headbutt on Derby County's Chris Martin

Easy pickings: Martin netted twice for the Rams as they beat Rangers 2-0 on Saturday afternoon 

Derby County: (4-1-4-1) Grant; Christie, Keogh, Forsyth, Naylor; Hughes; Russell (Ward 70), Hendrick, Bryson, Dawkins; Martin (Sammon 75).

Subs not used: Roos, Eustace, Bennett, Hanson, Bunjaku, Sammon, Freeman, Calero, Santos.

Booked: Martin.

Rangers: (4-2-3-1) Bell; McGregor, McCulloch, Mohsni, Wallace (Templeton 68); Hutton (Smith 60), Black; Macleod, Law, Aird (Boyd 60); Miller (Zaliukas 75).

Subs not used: Simonsen, Crawford, Shiels, Gallagher

Sent off: Mohsni.

Referee: Mark Heywood

The jolting collision will doubtless earn Mohsni a suspension to start the competitive season to go with a rebuke from Ally McCoist that his actions were ‘unacceptable’. The Rangers manager is not finished with him yet, either.

McCoist turned his back and had no interest engaging with the Tunisian international as he ambled towards the tunnel. Words were kept brief and to the point in the dressing room afterwards.

Mohsni can expect more talks over an incident that further taints a disciplinary record that McCoist will be wary of carrying into Championship battle if there remains the danger of a key player letting himself and colleagues down with a top flight return at stake.

'There are no excuses for it,' said McCoist, whose team face Hibernian in the Petrofac Training Cup on Tuesday then Hearts in the league kick-off on Sunday.

'It’s a big disappointment to see that happening. He’s going to have to learn. The team need him and we all need each other.

'He’s not a daft boy. When his head is in the right place and he’s focused, he’s an integral part of our team. But he’s let himself down.

'You can only point him in the right direction. He knows it’s wrong and unacceptable.

'At this moment we don’t know if he can play on Tuesday or Sunday. Straight away it’s given us a headache we could’ve done without.

'We spoke briefly but I don’t think that’s the best time to look at a situation. Sometimes you let the dust settle and assess the whole thing and have a chat with him.

'We will watch it again and talk about it further.'

A charming individual off the park, Mohsni is a combustible competitor drawn to wild mood swings on the pitch.

While Luis Suarez wheels out the same old biting act, Mohsni doesn’t have a signature move of indiscipline. 

Plenty to ponder: Gers boss Ally McCoist saw his team comfortably swept aside at the iPro Stadium

Pyro: A flare was thrown on to the pitch by one of Rangers' 8,000 travelling supporters 

He has a far more creative streak, finding all manner of ways to be sent off. The charge sheet before this moment of madness included three reds and 17 yellows in only 52 appearances for Southend United.

At previous clubs he’s argued with his own team-mates after a dismissal. Last season he saw red for clashing post-match with Airdrie boss Gary Bollan. There are dangerous fouls and fits of temper.

Could Saturday's all-new manoeuvre be the 27-year-old’s last in a Rangers jersey? There was interest from Abu Dhabi team Baniyas Sports Club during the close season.

With Darren McGregor at right back yesterday and Marius Zaliukas starting on the bench, McCoist does have centre half options.

Mohsni bailed out McGregor after an early slip let in Simon Dawkins but that last ditch tackle to prevent an early strike and a goal-line clearance late in the first half were highlights in front of 9000 travelling supporters.

He wasn’t the only Rangers player guilty of dodgy distribution issues that plagued efforts to work the ball to classier acts up the pitch in Nicky Law and Kenny Miller who, on limited evidence, are on the same wavelength.

Fraser Aird should’ve fared better with a back post header carved out by one such Law and Miller combination.

Good day's business: Derby manager Steve McClaren watched from the stands 

A lone striker for Derby in a struggling Premier League season of 2007/08, Miller’s return to the iPro Stadium saw him deployed in that role for an hour before the introduction of Kris Boyd to make a pair.

By then Derby’s up tempo opening to the second half had paved the way for victory. Johnny Russell caused problems and the Celtic fan and ex-Dundee United attacker was berated by Rangers fans right up until he gave the away end the sarcastic thumbs up at his substitution.

But it was Derby’s schemer on the opposite flank, Dawkins, who was the main danger and he smacked the base of Cammy Bell’s left hand post.

On 58 minutes, his speedy burst into the area was too much for Lee McCulloch and, as he drew Bell out of goal and into a collision with – you’ve guessed it - Mohsni, Dawkins picked out Martin lurking eight yards out. Last season’s top scorer bundled home.

For the second on 74, Martin’s movement evaded McGregor and he latched on to a Will Hughes pass to cleverly tuck home past Bell.

Martin craved a hat-trick but then clashed with Mohsni, was booked for his part in the flashpoint and swiftly replaced by Conor Sammon.
