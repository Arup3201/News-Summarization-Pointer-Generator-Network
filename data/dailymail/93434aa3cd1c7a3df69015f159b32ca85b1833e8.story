A photographer scaled the world's highest skyscraper to shoot vertigo-inducing photos of the brave workers who perform essential maintenance at its very peak.

Joe McNally ascended more than half a mile to the very tip of the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, the world's tallest manmade structure, to capture the breathtaking view from the top.

And not content with shooting a set of photos that will have the world gripping its swivel chairs, he has also published a vertigo-inducing behind-the-scenes video on YouTube showing how he did it.

The view from half-a-mile up: A site worker hangs from a safety rope at the very tip of Dubai's Burj Khalifa skyscraper which, at 2,722ft tall, is the highest man-made structure anywhere in the world

'The unusual vantage point': Mr McNally, who has 26 years' experience as a photographer for National Geographic, spent three years in correspondence with the building's administrator to arrange the shoot

Daredevils: Pictured is Johnny, one of the two maintenance workers who took Mr McNally to the top

'I've been a big fan always of getting my camera in different places and trying to seek the unusual vantage point,' said Mr Mcnally.

'The tower is obviously a commanding presence. It sprang out of the desert here. It's the tallest structure in the world.

'It's got a beauty and allure to it which is also part of the reason that you just want to go and climb this thing and get to the top of it, see what the mystery is all about and what the view might by like from the tallest man-made point on the planet.'

Mr McNally, a photographer with 26 years' experience shooting for National Geographic, had been visiting Dubai to teach at a special photography event in the city state.

He was given access to the 2,722ft Burj Khalifa after three years in correspondence with the building's administrator.

Long climb: Mr McNally's journey to the top started at 5am in a service lift to the 160th floor, then continued along several more flights of metal stairs up the final floors of the building's metal superstructure

'It's a lengthy climb and it's physically daunting': Mr McNally pictured climbing the final ladder to the very top

The route to the top starts at 5am in a service lift that runs right up the spine of the building to level 160, the very last concrete floor in the towering structure.

After that, accompanied by two of the building's maintenance workers, Mr McNally climbed a series of zig-zagging metal staircases up several more floors until they reached a final ladder.

'Just physically climbing you're talking about going straight up for a couple of hundred metres,' the photographer said.

'You're safety harnessed to the ladder. It's kind of a ratchet system where you can actually lean back and rest when you need to.

'And that just is a straight ladder right up to the very top. It's a lengthy climb and it's physically daunting.'

'A sense of humanity in the midst of this giant structure': Maintenance workers who do this climb every day

At the top of the building the workers helped Mr McNally ease himself out onto the side of the Burj Khalifa's spire, where he hung from safety ropes above a drop of more than half a mile.

There he also photographed the two men who helped him reach the record-breaking point.

'You don't want to go to the top of this tower and just take a snap looking down,' he said. 'You want to have a reference point, you want sense of humanity in the midst of this giant structure.'
