A rare set of illustrations of Romeo and Juliet by surrealist painter Salvador Dali and Juliet have been discovered.

The series, dated from 1975, consists of 10 offset lithographs reproduced to create 999 numbered books each containing 99 pages of heavy paper, bound text and Dali's unique depictions of Shakespeare's play.

The images have recently come to the wider public's attention after one gallery - Lockport Street Gallery in Plainfeild in Illinois, USA - placed book number 819 of 999 up for sale.

A gallery spokesman said: ‘Interest in this fascinating set is already peaking but we expect much more over the next few weeks as word begins to spread.

‘Because only a low amount of books with the additional images were ever created they are a real find for any Salvador Dali fan.’

Spaniard Dali, whose most famous work was his 1931 painting The Persistence of Memory, also painted other famous literary texts.

In 1945, he illustrated Don Quixote, and in 1969 put a quirky twist on Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland.

The illustrations are typically surreal and captivating
