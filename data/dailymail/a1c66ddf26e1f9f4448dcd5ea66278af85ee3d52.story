Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti has lamented the loss of Gareth Bale for the games against Liverpool and Saturday's El Clasico.

Wales international Bale has been struggling with a buttock muscle injury and will take no part in the Champions League encounter or the match against Madrid's bitter rivals Barcelona.

And Ancelotti knows just how much Bale will be missed, with the world's most expensive player scoring a spectacular goal in his last match against Barcelona to help Real lift the Copa del Rey.

'Gareth Bale is very important for us because he has a fantastic quality in every sense,' Ancelotti said.

'We have to replace him. We have a fantastic squad so we have to replace him.

'You lose things in both attack and defence with Gareth.'

Luis Suarez is set to make his Barcelona debut in this Saturday's clash.
