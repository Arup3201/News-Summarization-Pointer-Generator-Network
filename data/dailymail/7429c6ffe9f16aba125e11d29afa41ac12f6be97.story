Harry Kane deservedly tops this week's EA Sports' Performance Index after another pulsating weekend of Premier League football.

Following his first call-up to the senior England squad, the 21-year-old striker capped a memorable week by netting his first Premier League hat-trick to help Spurs to a 4-3 victory against Leicester City.

Kane is now the Premier League's joint-top scorer alongside Diego Costa and continues to lead the line brilliantly for Mauricio Pochettino's side while earning a Game Index score of 71, which is 11 points higher than Olivier Giroud in second place.

The EA Sports PPI is the official player rating index of the  Premier League.

It measures a player's contribution to the success of his team. The intention is to remove any opinion bias and only work with proven statistical measurements which become more accurate as the season progresses. So, what are the six indices?

1. Winning performance

2. Player's performance per match

3. Appearances

4. Goals scored

5. Assists

6. Clean sheets

Arsenal's French frontman earns the runner-up spot following another impressive brace which helped the Gunners put John Carver's Newcastle to the sword on Saturday.

Giroud gave Newcastle defender Mike Williamson a torrid first 45 minutes in which he scored twice and completed 81.6 per cent of his passes for Arsene Wenger's side. 

Manchester United's midfielder Juan Mata completes the top three with a Game Index total of 56.3 after a stunning double against Liverpool as the Old Trafford club earned a hard-fought 2-1 victory at Anfield. 

Other names to make the top 10 list this week include Aaron Lennon thanks to his first goal in an Everton shirt and Manchester City's Fernando, who scored the crucial second goal while clocking up a 98 per cent pass completion rate against West Brom.

Jose Mourinho's Chelsea got off to a flying start in the 3-2 victory against Hull and it was their star man Eden Hazard that put his side ahead inside two minutes. 

Hazard's brilliant display added with an 11th domestic strike of the season means the Belgian grabs sixth spot.
