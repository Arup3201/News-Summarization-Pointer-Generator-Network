Former partner and star witness in the trial of James 'Whitey' Bulger today accused the reputed gangster of being a pedophile.

Stephen 'The Rifleman' Flemmi had acknowledged in testimony that he engaged in oral sex with his longtime girlfriend's teenage daughter, Deborah Hussey, who had called him 'Daddy' but lobbed the accusations back on Whitey when testifying today.

Flemmi also testified that Bulger strangled Hussey after she started using drugs, getting arrested and dropping their names when she got in trouble.

Stephen 'The Rifleman' Flemmi, (pictured left in 1974 and right in 2008), the former partner of reputed gangster James 'Whitey' Bulger, says he watched as Bulger strangled Flemmi's stepdaughter, a woman who had called him 'Daddy' since she was a toddler

But Bulger's lawyer Hank Brennan 
pressed Flemmi on his assertion and suggested that Flemmi, not Bulger, 
killed Hussey after she told her mother he molested her.

Flemmi didn't want to be seen as a pedophile, Brennan said.

But Flemmi said that if Brennan 
wanted to talk about pedophilia, 'right over there at that table,' 
gesturing toward where Bulger was seated.

Bulger glanced at Flemmi but did not 
visibly react. Flemmi had told jurors earlier that Bulger once took a 
16-year-old girl to Mexico with him. He did not say when that was.

Flemmi was in his fourth day testifying against the reputed Boston crime boss at Bulger's racketeering trial.

Bulger, 83, is accused of participating in 19 killings during the 1970s and '80s while leading the notorious Winter Hill Gang.

He fled Boston in 1994 and was one of the nation's most-wanted fugitives until he was captured in California two years ago.

Flemmi, 79, has pleaded guilty to 10 murders and is serving a life sentence.

Testifying Monday, Flemmi acknowledged that he twice had oral sex with Hussey in what he called 'a moment of weakness'.

Flemmi said Hussey's mother, Marion, 
had been his live-in girlfriend since Hussey was just a toddler and that
she had called him 'Daddy' from a young age.

'A girl who called you 'Daddy' consented to sex with you?' Brennan asked.

Flemmi said the sexual contact took place when Hussey became 'a different person' because of 'her demeanor, her lifestyle.'

He said she had been frequenting Boston's Combat Zone, then a center of drugs and prostitution.

Neither Brennan nor Flemmi specified how old Hussey was at the time. She was 26 when she was killed in 1985.

Turning his testimony to her death, Flemmi said he reluctantly agreed to bring Hussey to a home in South Boston.

'Jim Bulger stepped out from behind 
the top of the basement stairs and grabbed her by the throat and started
strangling her,' Flemmi said.

'He lost his balance and they both fell on the floor, and he continued strangling her.'

When Bulger attorney Hank Brennan 
initially asked Flemmi about whether he had a sexual relationship with 
Hussey, Flemmi asked him to clarify whether he was talking about 
intercourse or oral sex. He then acknowledged having oral sex with her 
twice.

'I 
never inflicted any abuse on her; that was consensual,' Flemmi said, 
prompting murmurs from family members of some of Bulger's alleged 
victims in the courtroom.

Hussey was one of three people who were buried in the same house after Bulger killed them, Weeks testified previously. He said he helped move the bodies later when the house was being sold. In 2000, after he began cooperating with the government, he led authorities to the bodies.

Flemmi also testified on Monday that Bulger had boasted of a 1982 drive-by shooting in which he killed a mobster that he learned was an FBI informant.

'He had good firepower in the car and he was driving,' Flemmi said of the shooting in which Bulger killed Brian Halloran, the FBI informant, and another man, Michael Donahue.

'He leaned over and he fired from the passenger side and hit Donahue, killed Donahue,' Flemmi said. Bulger then shot Halloran as he tried to flee, Flemmi said.

Bulger bragged about the killings during a meeting at Flemmi's mother's house, according to the testimony.
