Pope Francis has branded the sexual abuse of children by priests an ugly crime comparable to a 'satanic Mass' saying he would show zero tolerance for anyone in the Catholic Church who abused children, including bishops.

Speaking on the plane taking him back from a visit to the Middle East, the pope also announced that he would have his first meeting with a group of abuse victims at the Vatican early next month.

'Sexual abuse is such an ugly crime ... because a priest who does this betrays the body of the Lord. It is like a satanic Mass,' he said in some of the toughest language he has used on a crisis that has rocked the Church for more than a decade.

On the flight he announced he would meet soon with a group of sex abuse victims at the Vatican and declared 'zero tolerance' for any member of the clergy who would violate a child

'We must go ahead with zero tolerance,' he said, adding that three bishops were currently under investigation.

Francis said he would meet with eight victims and Cardinal Sean Patrick O'Malley of Boston, who is head of a commission set up to study ways of dealing with the crisis.

Speaking to reporters for nearly an hour on the plane taking him back from a visit to the Middle East, the pope looked alert despite the gruelling three-day trip and overruled his spokesman who suggested the airborne news conference should be cut short to all him to rest.

Pope 
Francis and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu traded words on 
Monday over the language spoken by Jesus two millennia ago.

'Jesus
 was here, in this land. He spoke Hebrew,' Mr Netanyahu told Francis, at
 a public meeting in Jerusalem in which the Israeli leader cited a 
strong connection between Judaism and Christianity.

'Aramaic,' the pope interjected.

'He spoke Aramaic, but he knew Hebrew,' Netanyahu shot back.

Like many things in the Middle East, 
where the pope is on the last leg of a three-day visit, modern-day 
discourse about Jesus is complicated and often political.

Jesus was born in Bethlehem in the Roman-ruled region of Judea, now the Israeli-occupied West Bank.

He grew up in Nazareth and ministered in Galilee, both in northern Israel, and died in Jerusalem, a city revered by Jews, Christians and Muslims, and to which Israelis and Palestinians lay claim.

Palestinians sometimes describe Jesus as a Palestinian. Israelis object to that.

Israeli
 linguistics professor Ghil'ad Zuckermann says that both 
Netanyahu, son of a distinguished Jewish historian, and the pope, the 
spiritual leader of the world's 1.2 billion Catholics, have a point.

'Jesus was a native Aramaic speaker, 'he said about the largely defunct Semitic language closely related to Hebrew.

'But he would have also known Hebrew because there were extant religious writings in Hebrew.'

Zuckermann said that during Jesus' time, Hebrew was spoken by the lower classes - 'the kind of people he ministered to'.

Francis said the victims, several from Europe, would attend his morning Mass and then he would meet with them.

It will be the first time for Francis to meet sexual abuse victims since his election in March 2013.

It
 was not clear, however, if the pope also meant zero tolerance for 
bishops who are not accused of being abusers themselves but who are 
accused of having turned a blind eye to abuse by priests in their 
dioceses or who may have covered up abuse scandals.

O'Malley
 said last month in Rome that the commission he heads will recommend 
that negligent clerics be held accountable regardless of their rank in 
the Church.

In
 many cases of abuse, most of which took place decades ago but surfaced 
in the past 15 years or so, bishops seeking to protect the Church's 
reputation moved priests from parish to parish instead of defrocking 
them or handing them over to police.

Victims'
 groups have pressed the Vatican to hold bishops who either shielded 
abusers or were negligent in protecting children to account, along with 
abusers themselves.

The
 executive director of the main U.S. victims' group, Survivors Network 
of Those Abused by Priests, or SNAP, dismissed the meeting as 'just 
utterly, utterly meaningless.'

'The
 simple truth is this is another gesture, another public relations coup,
 another nice bit of symbolism that will leave no child better off and 
bring no real reform to a continuing, scandal-ridden church hierarchy,' 
said SNAP Executive Director David Clohessy.

Clohessy
 said the pope has shown himself capable of making real change in other 
areas such as church governance and finance but hasn't done so in 
dealing with sex abuse by Catholic clergy.

But
 a U.S. attorney who represents clergy abuse victims hoped the meeting 
would be 'substantive and meaningful' rather than for cosmetic purposes.
 attorney Mitchell Garabedian said 'meeting directly with victims is the
 most powerful tool that the pope can use in understanding the ugliness 
and horror of clergy sexual abuse and why it must be stopped or 
prevented.'

In
 February, the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child 
accused the Vatican of systematically turning a blind eye to decades of 
abuse and attempting to cover up sex crimes.

The Vatican called the report unfair and ideologically slanted.

Francis spoke to reporters for nearly an hour, taking all 11 questions posed and responding with candor and occasional humor.

He said he would travel to Sri Lanka for two days and the Philippines in January 2015.

And he suggested that he might follow in emeritus Pope Benedict XVI's footsteps and retire if he no longer had the strength to do the job.

'We need to
 look at him as an institution: he opened a door, the door of emeritus 
popes,' Francis said. 'Only God knows if there will be others, but the 
door is open.'

If
 and when the time comes, he said, 'I will do what the Lord tells me to 
do, pray and try to find God's will. But I think that Benedict XVI 
wasn't a unique case.'

Francis
 sought to lower expectations about his planned encounter in the Vatican
 next month with the Israeli and Palestinian presidents, which he 
announced during the trip. He stressed that they were coming to pray 
together, not enter into peace mediation.

'We are coming just to pray, then everyone goes home,' he said. 'But I think prayer is important, praying together.'

He said he had originally hoped to arrange the encounter in Jerusalem itself, but that the idea was scrapped because of the enormous logistical problems that would have been involved.

Preparations are already under way, he said, noting that a rabbi and Islamic cleric would join him in leading the prayers.

One of the more poignant moments of Francis' pilgrimage came Monday when he visited the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem and kissed the hands of survivors in a show of humility and respect. Francis said his gesture came spontaneously.

'The gestures that are the most authentic you don't think about,' ahead of time, he said.

Given his respect for Holocaust survivors, Francis was asked what he intended to do about the pending beatification case for Pope Pius XII, the World War II-era pope accused by some Jews of not speaking out enough against the Holocaust.

Jewish groups have asked that the case be shelved pending the opening of the archives of his pontificate, or at least until the generation of Holocaust survivors has passed.

Francis has bent the Vatican's saint-making rules for a half-dozen people so far in his pontificate, waiving the usual second miracle requirement for example to canonize Pope John XXIII last month. Francis, however, offered no such wiggle room for Pius.

'There's still no miracle,' he said. 'If there are no miracles, it can't go forward. It's blocked there.'

Just hours after Pope Francis left a fire broke out at Dormition Abbey, a Catholic sanctuary atop Mount Zion in Jerusalem's old city.

The fire, started by a suspected arsonist, damaged a guest book at the Jerusalem holy site marking the location of Jesus' last supper.
