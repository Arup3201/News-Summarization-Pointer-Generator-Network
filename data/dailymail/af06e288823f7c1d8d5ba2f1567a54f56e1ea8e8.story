From Frida Kahlo to Grammy award winner Lila Downs, the colourful, beautifully embroidered rebozo has long proved popular with stylish creatives.

But it wasn't always so as an exhibition opening early next month at London's Fashion and Textile Museum reveals.

Loved by revolutionaries who sported it during the Mexican Revolution, the garment has since become synonymous with Mexican culture as well as a fixture in the nation's wardrobes.

Ironically for a garment beloved of revolutionaries, the rebozo started life as a relative of the Spanish mantilla shawl - introduced to Mexico when colonisers arrived in the New World in the wake of early explorers Christopher Columbus and Sir Walter Raleigh.

Even its name derives from Spanish Castilian, with the word rebozo translated as the act of covering or protecting yourself, as defined by 17th century grammarian, Alonso Molina.

Nevertheless, the garment, known to Nahuatl-speakers [Aztec] as 'ciua nequealtlapacholoni', was soon adopted by the locals and given a colourful makeover that included native textiles and embroidery techniques.

By the 1800s, its popularity was such that all women, regardless of their ethnicity or social class, wore them, whether at work, home or church.

Later, during the Second Mexican Empire, the garment was worn by Empress Carlota, wife of Mexico's first and only Hapsburg emperor, Maxmillian I.

But Carlota wasn't the only one to wear it. Along with famous proponents such as Frida Kahlo, who popularised the garment abroad, the rebozo also proved a hit with a very different sort of wearer - the revolutionary.

The Mexican Revolution of 1910 brought the rebozo global notoriety as the garment of choice for the 'Adelitas' - rebel women who used it to smuggle guns and other weapons past government checkpoints.

By the time the strife ended in 1920, with a victory for the Partido Nacional Revolucionario [National Revolutionary Party], the rebozo had become synonymous with Mexico's struggle for independence.

Today, the garment remains a key part of Mexican national dress, the China Poblana, and represents the 
journey from birth to death, thanks to its use as both a baby carrier and a shroud.

The
 new exhibition celebrates all of its many uses as well as drawing 
heavily on the collection of Belgian diplomat Robert Everts, who between
 1902 and 1906 lived and worked in Mexico City.

One of the first to recognise the rebozo's cultural significance, Everts collected thousands of pieces, some of which will go on display in London for the first time.

Another to contribute work to the exhibition is British designer Zandra Rhodes who has created a unique rebozo of her own.

Other highlights include work by Graciela Iturbide, Antonio Turok and Lourdes Almeida, while an installation by artist Mauricio Cervantes takes a closer look at the ‘aroma de luto’ rebozo and its use as a death shroud.

Commenting on the exhibition, Celia Joicey, head of the Fashion and Textile Museum, said: ‘This important exhibition powerfully demonstrates the vibrancy of textiles in historic and contemporary Mexico.

'We are delighted to be showing the work of leading Mexican artists, designers and museums, in the only UK building designed by Mexican architect Ricardo Legorreta.'

Made in Mexico: The Rebozo in Art, Culture and Fashion opens on the 6th June and runs until the 30th August. For more information, see ftmlondon.org
