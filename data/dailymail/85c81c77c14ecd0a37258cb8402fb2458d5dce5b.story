Singer hinted his personal issues and insecurities played a big part in breakdown of marriage

Said everyone goes through 'challenges' in their lives 'whether it’s love
 or money, kids, or illness'

Chris Martin has spoken about how his personal issues played a part in his marital split from Gwyneth Paltrow.

In a revealing interview with BBC Radio 1's Zane Lowe, the Coldplay frontman gave the first real insight into troubles within his ten-year marriage to the actress.

'About two years ago I was a mess really 
because I can't enjoy the thing that we are good at and I can't enjoy 
the great things around me because I'm burdened by this,' the 38-year old said.

'I've got to 
not blame anyone else and make some changes.'

Ready to talk: Coldplay frontman Chris Martin - seen outside his hotel in Germany on Saturday - has spoken about his split from Gwyneth Paltrow in a new interview

He continued: 'I wouldn’t use the word breakdown, this was 
more a realisation about trying to grow up basically.

'If you can’t open yourself up, you can’t appreciate the wonder 
inside. So you can be with someone very wonderful, but because of your 
own issues you cannot let that be celebrated in the right way.

'What
 changed for me was - I don’t want to go through life being scared of 
it, being scared of love, being scared of rejection, being scared of 
failure.'

Chris appeared to be shouldering the blame for how the couple's troubles began. He said: 'Up to a 
certain point in my life I wasn’t completely vulnerable and it caused 
some problems.'

He
 added: 'If you don’t let love really in then you can’t really give it 
back.

'So what Ghost Story means to me is like you’ve got to open 
yourself up to love and if you really do, of course it will be painful 
at times, but then it will be great at some point.

Happier times: The musician spoke exclusively to BBC Radio 1's Zane Lowe about how the 'breakdown' of his ten-year-marriage inspired his new album, Ghost Stories

The
 musician took part in an hour long interview, which will air on Monday 
evening, and while he did not mention his estranged wife by name, he 
spoke about candidly about his love and life.

Chris mused: 'I think in life everyone needs to be broken in some way.

'I
 think everyone in their life goes through challenges, whether it’s love
 or money, kids, or illness... You have to really not run away from that
 stuff.

'Life
 throws these colorful challenges at you … what we decided to do on 
Ghost Stories was to really be honest about it and say, this is what’s 
been happening.'

Hard to love: Chris revealed that his inability to let in love has caused problems in his life

Speaking about his new single Magic, Chris explained: 'It’s about saying this person is really awesome and is magic, and of course certain parts of it have to change because that’s life but not everything has to be black or white or clear cut and that’s okay.

'It’s not a question of you either really love someone or you really hate someone, its more nuanced than that - especially with the modern world’s complications – like travelling and all the stuff that come to life, and illness and addiction and all that sort of thing.

While the video sees Chris saving a damsel from an unhappy relationship, Chris said: 'It’s just saying - ultimately there is magic between two people no matter what anyone else thinks.'

The couple, who were considered one of Hollywood's most solid partnerships, stunned the showbiz world when they confirmed their split less than two months ago on March 25.

The interview also saw Chris reveal his admiration for pop boyband One Direction.

Chris admitted: 'I think One Direction are the biggest band in the world, their songs are great. 'I’m saying One Direction are brilliant and I’m not kidding. You know why? Because their songs are really good and I don’t think that any of them are going to go solo. I think they appreciate their chemistry from watching their movie.

He spoke candidly about his appreciation of Harry Styles as he added: 'Harry has come to a couple of our shows, I think I probably said the same thing about chemistry.

'I can’t remember - I was too enamored with his hair cut.  I was like this: ‘I was pretty sure I was a straight guy before’ - I was having a hot flush.'

He also shared his admiration for Kanye West.

'That
 guy is amazing and I think he is misunderstood by people who only look 
on the surface. I understand what he is talking about and I understand 
what he means.'

The full hour-long interview with Chris Martin will be broadcast at 8pm on Monday 28 April on Zane Lowe's BCC Radio 1 show.
