It's a fine line between life and death. And this was no more apparent when daredevil 'slackline' walker Dean Potter wobbled his way across one of China's largest canyons - without a safety net.

Thrill-seeker Potter shuffled his way across Enshi Grand Canyon, in central China's Hubei province, balancing precariously on a rope just two centimetres thick almost 6,000 feet - or 1,800 metres - above sea level.

The specially-designed rope is known as a 'slackline' and is considered to be more challenging than a conventional tightrope as the line is not 
completely taut, therefore susceptible to bouncing and stretching.

Wobble: Potter sways and staggers across the slackline, barefoot and 
wearing a bright orange t-shirt, a cap - with the aid of a pair of 
headphones

Halfway there: Potter successfully completed the slackline walk in under three minutes

Spectacle: Onlookers watch as the daredevil carries out his death-defying stunt at 6,000-feet above sea level

Onlookers watched from the ground in awe and wonder as Potter crossed the distance of 40 metres - or just over 130 feet - in under three minutes, swaying and staggering in a bid to keep his balance.

As he neared the end of the line the daredevil - who was dressed in a bright orange t-shirt and wore headphone - broke into a bound and completed the line in a few daring leaps.

He kissed the ground once he had made it safely across the canyon.

The Enshi Grand Canyon is not the only natural wonder conquered by Potter, a 40-year-old from New Hampshire in the U.S.

Balancing act: Potter draws gasps as he totters across the line, but incredibly he regains his stability

On solid ground: Potter kisses the rocks as he safely makes it across 
the canyon... before triumphantly throwing his hands in the air in a victorious 
gesture to the crowd

The slackline walker - who is also a rock climber - has also carried out death-defying stunts at Yosemite National Park.

From clinging to the edge of cliffs with no safety rope to delicately perching on an inch-thick highline 2,600ft above Yosemite falls, Potter pushed himself to the limit to conquer incredible heights last year.

Potter has previously said about his stunts: 'When I'm on the high line it feels like I'm hovering in space.

'I
know it's insane to think I could fly but to make it possible you truly
have to believe in it - to go to a place that's not accepted.

Extreme sports: Potter is no stranger to danger - he has also performed similar stunts at Yosemite National Park

'I don't have thoughts of an afterlife. I think dying is like when you swat a fly - it's over.

'I'm
addicted to the heightened awareness I get when there's a death 
consequence. My vision is sharper and I'm more sensitive to sounds, my 
sense of balance and the beauty all around me.

'A
lot of my creativity comes from this nearly insane obsession. Something
sparkles in my mind and then nothing else in life matters.'
