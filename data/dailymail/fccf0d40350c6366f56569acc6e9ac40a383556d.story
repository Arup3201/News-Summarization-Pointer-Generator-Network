Crude: Jacintha Saldanha killed herself just days after being duped by Australian radio DJs

The chairman of the radio station behind the hoax 'royal call' that resulted in the death of duped nurse Jacintha Saldanha crudely brushed the incident off today by declaring to shareholders that 's*** happens'.

At the annual meeting of shareholders
 of Southern Cross Media - owners of Sydney radio station 2Day FM - in 
Melbourne today, chairman Max Moore-Wilton tried to play down the 
controversy with a crude, casual throw-away line.

'These incidents were unfortunate, no doubt about that,' he said.

'But in the immortal words of someone whose identity I cannot recall, s*** happens.'

It was last December that presenters Mel Greig and Michael Christian called King Edward VII hospital where the Duchess of Cambridge was being treated pretending to be the Queen and Prince Charles.

Mrs Saldanha failed to see through their poor
 impersonations and transferred them through to another nurse who 
revealed some details about her condition.

Three days later Jacintha Saldanha was found hanged at her London accommodation.

Only
 two months ago, it emerged that in one of the three letters she left, 
Mrs Saldanha directly accused the two Australian DJs of driving her to 
her death.

She even said they should pay the mortgage for the Bristol home where her accountant husband Benedict Barboza, 49, and children Junal, 17, and Lisha, 14, still live.

In
 the handwritten note, addressed to her managers at the Edward VII 
hospital, she said: ‘Please accept my apologies. I am truly sorry. Thank
 you for all your support.

‘I
 hold the Radio Australians Mel Greig and Michael Christian responsible
 for this act. Please make them pay my mortgage. I am sorry. Jacintha.’

After the meeting he was asked whether he had any regrets about his comment.

'I think it was a one-sentence comment wasn't it?' he told Fairfax Media.

'I have no comment. I made a comment in one sentence. I am glad the media is so busy.'

Shareholders were told that revenue from the company's metropolitan radio stations, which include the 2Day FM and Triple M networks, fell last year due due to scandals involving presenter Kyle Sandilands - who on one occasion called an editor a 'fat slag' - and what the company called 'the UK incident'.

The company suspended all advertising on 2Day FM after the royal hoax scandal, but it did not prevent chief executive Rhys Holleran's total pay rising by more than $350,000 (£210,000)  to $1.66 million (£958,000) during the last financial year.

The scandal also did not prevent one of the DJs, Mr Christian, winning a 'Top Jock' award - while his co-presenter, Miss Greig, remained in shock at the consequences of the hoax call and was unable to return to work.

An inquest into the death of Miss Saldanha was adjourned last month after Westminster Coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox asked the family to supply medical records that might provide evidence about her state of mind at the time of her death.
