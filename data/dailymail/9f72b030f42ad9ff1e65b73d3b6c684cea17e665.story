Nick Gordon has sent a defiant message to Bobby Brown and the Houston family by having the ailing heiress's name tattooed across his arm in huge letters.

He posted the picture on his Facebook page after being barred from visiting her bedside in an Atlanta hospital.

His frustration was revealed by Daily Mail.com last week when it was disclosed he had told friends of his intense love for her and his hope that she would recover and clear his name which is at the center of a police investigation.

Some members of the Houston family have said they expect him to be charged in connection with her hospitalization.

Gordon's decision to have her name etched onto his left arm is the clearest sign yet that he intends to fight for her if she recovers.

Other side: This image from 2012 has surfaced also showing Nick Gordon with a gun. It had been deleted and published on Straightfromthea.com - then reproduced this weekend on an anti-Gordon website

Menace: Another picture from Nick Gordon's social media which is being highlighted by the website which suggests he represented a danger to her

But it comes at the same time as a picture of Bobbi Kristina's 'husband' is at the center of an increasingly dirty war between him and her father.

The image was published this weekend on a website devoted to portraying Nick Gordon as a danger to 21-year-old Bobbi Kristina.

The website called 'Is Nick Gordon Guilty in what happened with Bobbi Kristina?' also claims the critically-ill daughter of Brown and the late Whitney Houston was about to split up with Gordon.

It features details of bitter rows between Gordon, 25, and Bobbi Kristina who has been unconscious and on life support since January 31 after being found face down in her bathtub.

But it is the picture of Gordon holding a gun while driving behind the wheel of a car which is certain to fuel Bobby Brown's determination to keep him away from his daughter.

It was first apparently tweeted by Gordon himself in 2012 and then deleted.

The Atlanta website 'Straight from the A' published it at the time and claimed it had increased fears for Bobbi Kristina's safety over her relationship with him.

But this weekend it was republished on the anti-Gordon website. 

It is certain to inflame anger against Gordon, who was brought up by Whitney Houston from the age of 12 and became Kristina's boyfriend.

He has been accused of abusing the kindness of the Houston family and threatening Bobbi Kristina's matrnal aunt, Marion Houston.

She has successfully sought an order of protection against Gordon, accusing him of stalking her and sending her threatening messages, which reportedly included photos of guns. The restraining order expires in April.

Gordon is also at the center of a police investigation into how his girlfriend, who he claims to have married, came to have facial bruising at the time of her near drowning.

Abusive: This was the letter Bobbi Kristina and Nick Gordon sent to a neighbor after they were thrown out of their apartment in a well-off part of Atlanta for 'partying and fighting'

Gun image: Another picture from Nick Gordon's Twitter feed showing his interest in guns 

The wedding claim has been denied by Bobby Brown who is said to be 'praying hard and singing hymns' at his daughter's bedside in a bid to aid her recovery.

Gordon is also persona non grata with the Houston family who, with her father,have banned him from visiting Kristina, whose organs are said to be failing.

Friends of Kristina accuse Gordon of being a bad influence on her and leading her into trouble with rumors of drug abuse.

The couple were thrown out of their luxury apartment at Amli North Point after complaints by residents of their 'fighting and partying'.

One neighbor told Daily Mail.com: 'They were a couple of spoilt brats and the police were called several times to attend their home.

'Most of us thought Kristina was a young and impressionable young woman who hung on her boyfriend's every word.

'When they were finally kicked out,they wrote an insulting letter to the couple they thought had been most behind getting rid of them. But we were all relieved to see them go. They were a nuisance and their letter proved that.'

Division: Bob Brown, pictured this weekend after visiting his daughter, has issued a public denial that Nick Gordon was married to his daughter

Gordon has denied harming Bobbi Kristina and told a friend: 'I didn't do anything to my baby.

'I just hope she wakes up and tells 'em what they all need to know.

'People are just jumping on my back cos she loves me. There's a load of nonsense being said about us. I love her, but I can't get anywhere near her.'

But senior members of the Houston family claim Gordon is a bad influence on a vulnerable and motherless young woman, who stands to inherit $12 million from her mother's estate when she turns 30

A third person, Bobbi Kristina's cousin Jerod, has also been dragged into the fallout of the recriminations against Gordon with Bobby Brown marginalizing him and urging people to 'disregard' him.

Jerod, a musician who gave TV interviews and spoke up on behalf of Gordon, was left reeling by Bobby Brown's public statement against him

In a Facebook posting at the weekend he pleaded: ' How about you all reach out to every staton I ever did an interview with.

'Ask how much I got for any interview….$000,000.'

He added: 'My reward is seeing Bobbi Kristina walk out of that hospital. Thanks for those who continue to pray for Kristina. I LOVE YOU COUSIN.'

It has been reported that Bobbi Kristina's condition has worsened with her organs beginning to fail and the next 48 hours will be key to her survival.

Her father faces the agonizing decision on whether to have her life support machine and ventilator turned off or urge doctors to continue to try to save the 21-year-old who stands to inherit $12 million at the age of 30.

Claims emerged at the weekend that a decision would be made this week.

But a lawyer for Bobby Brown said that was not going to happen. Christopher Brown told People magazine that was 'false'.
