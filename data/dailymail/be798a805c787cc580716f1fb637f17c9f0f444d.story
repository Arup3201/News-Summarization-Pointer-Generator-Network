The Queen is looking for a royal chewing gum remover to keep her palaces clean.

An official advert for a cleaner at Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh states the successful applicant must ‘arrange for the removal of chewing gum from Historic and State Apartments’.

The £16,000-per-year job listed on the British Monarchy website will require the staff member to pick sticky gum off furniture for four hours a day.

The Queen is looking for a royal chewing gum cleaner to remove the sticky substance from her palaces

A royal source told The Sun: ‘It is extraordinary that guests to the Royal Palaces do leave chewing gum.

‘You wouldn’t expect people to be chewing gum when they visit, let alone stick it on the priceless antiques or parquet furniture.’

A spokesman from Buckingham Palace added: ‘A tiny minority of individuals leave chewing gum at the Royal Palaces and it has to be removed.’

The cleaner, who will reportedly also carry out shifts at the London residence, will be expected to clean the entire palace’s stairs, make the beds and do the washing-up.

The cleaner will be based at the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh, the Queen's official Scottish residence

As the Queen’s official residence in Scotland, it is one of the country’s premier visitor attractions and draws 250,000 people every year.

The latest member of staff will have to ensure all toilets are cleaned before public access at 9.30am and double up as a cloakroom attendant during evening functions.

Other responsibilities include cleaning out and relining wardrobes, cleaning all brass and reporting any defects to the housekeeper.

The British Monarchy is also looking to recruit a new sous chef for Buckingham Palace and a restorer of upholstery at Windsor Castle.

The successful applicant will reportedly have to pick chewing gum off furniture at Buckingam Palace too
