He's already made a name for himself as the UK's top Michael Bublé tribute act but now Mr England - a.k.a Jordan Williams - is set to make a bid for singing stardom under his own name.

The singer, who plans to enter next season's Britain's Got Talent competition, hopes that the festive tune will hit the number one spot - and raise plenty of money for charity in the process.

Entitled Here We Are (Merry Christmas), the three-minute track was penned by aspiring songwriter Liam Hopkins, 25, from Warwickshire.

According to Hopkins, the song, which is available to download on iTunes, was inspired by his mother - who also encouraged him to turn the ditty into a Christmas tune.

'When I gave Jordan a call and sent him the song we received a positive reaction,' explains Hopkins, who spent more than five years searching for the perfect person to sing the track.

'We then met up and recorded the vocals on the hottest day of the year in a converted attic studio in Coventry.'

Proceeds from the single will go to Beauty With A Purpose, an organisation that funds poverty-alleviating initiatives around the world, and Harborough Against Bullying, a Midlands-based charity aimed at tackling nastiness to children.

'I recorded the single when we had incredible weather late July so it was strange singing about Christmas but I feel that the UK market has been crying out for a proper Christmas song that tells about the true values and ethos of Christmas,' explains Jordan.

'This song, I believe, does that. I'm hoping that we can make it into the top 40 and who knows, with the public behind us, maybe even the number one spot.

'Singing is my life and since winning Mr England, doors have really started to open up for me in the industry.

'I hope that everyone gets behind the record as it's for a good cause and it would be nice to have a real Christmas song on that top spot.'

Jordan, 25, from Warwickshire, took home this year's Mr England title after impressing the judges with his Michael Bublé tribute act during the talent round.

No stranger to pageants, he came runner-up in the 2011 Mr Coventry competition and triumphed in the Mr Rugby event in 2012.

Since taking home the Mr England prize, Jordan has concentrated on charity work and is an ambassador for Zoe’s Place Baby Hospice, which has branches in Coventry, Liverpool and Middlesborough.
