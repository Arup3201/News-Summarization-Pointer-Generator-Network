From cookbooks to cranberries, putting Delia Smith’s name to something has long been a recipe for success.

Substitute a dash of Delia with a pinch of Pippa, however, and it seems to leave a rather sour taste.

Customers are struggling to stomach the news that the Duchess of Cambridge’s sister is replacing Delia as a columnist in Waitrose’s magazine.

Pippa Middleton's new role seems to have left a sour taste in Waitrose customers' mouths

Just days after Miss Middleton was appointed as the face of the supermarket, shoppers have flooded Waitrose’s Twitter and Facebook accounts with their complaints.

‘A gratuitous insult to any customers with half a brain!’ wrote one, as another warned: ‘If her party book is anything to go by, you may well regret your decision.’

Pippa’s book, Celebrate, offered illuminating advice including a recipe for making ice.

It also gave tips such as pouring hot drinks from flasks into ‘mugs or paper cups’, and counselled that toasting marshmallows over a fire required ‘a long-handled fork’ and ‘flames’.

Waitrose ditched Delia, 71 – whose cookery books have sold 21million copies – when her three-year contract ended in January.

The first column by Pippa, 29, will be published in the April edition of Waitrose Kitchen, on sale from the end of this month.

The magazine’s editor has promised she will dispense sage advice on how to prepare a ‘Friday night feast’, and said her ‘wealth of experience’ will be ‘loved’ by readers.

But customers have already begun asking why they would take cookery tips from someone who has ‘probably never boiled an egg’.

Kitchen favourite: Delia is considered a domestic expert , but Waitrose have asked Pippa to hand out cookery advice

One Twitter user wrote: ‘Can’t believe Waitrose has replaced queen of cooking Delia with Pippa’, while another said: ‘I want a real cook to inspire me, not a relative of the royals who just happens to be famous for wearing a dress.’

The comments can all be viewed on Waitrose’s Twitter feed, which has 42,000 followers. Meanwhile, on the supermarket’s Facebook page, James Hunting wrote that Pippa’s appointment was a ‘ridiculous idea’, adding: ‘I am not sure she has a grasp on the lifestyle and concerns of the typical Waitrose shopper.’

Another customer, David Lee, added: ‘Why oh why would you drop Delia Smith, we have used her recipes for years! Pippa is hardly a famous cook, perhaps a few cupcakes, does that qualify her for the job?’

Gamely, Waitrose has been replying to each and every comment, thanking customers for their ‘suggestions’ and repeating: ‘Pippa is not a replacement for Delia. Pippa will write a column in our monthly Waitrose Kitchen magazine.’

Pippa has told fans she is looking forward to writing her column, saying: ‘It will be an exciting opportunity to share my passion and enthusiasm for food and entertaining.’

Last night a Waitrose spokesman said: ‘We are not making any  comment about what is on  Facebook and Twitter because we are absolutely delighted that Pippa Middleton is joining us as a  columnist.’ Delia Smith was unavailable for comment.
