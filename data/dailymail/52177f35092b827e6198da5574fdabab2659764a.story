Cornelius Gurlitt, 81, who his a £1bn trove of suspected stolen Nazi art in his Munich flat it to be given some of the art back

A German recluse accused of hording £1billion worth of art thought to be stolen by the Nazis is to get some paintings back, a court has ruled.

Thousands of works by masters such as Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse and Otto Dix were discovered in the house of 81-year-old Cornelius Gurlitt in 2012 during a small-scale tax investigation.

Gurlitt has now agreed to return any work which investigators can prove was stolen, but if there is no evidence of theft after a year then the paintings will be released to him.

Of the 1,401 works found at his Munich home, roughly 500 are currently in doubt. Gurlitt's spokesman said he expects to get between 300 and 350 works back.

Gurlitt inherited the collection from his father, Hildebrand, who took orders from Adolf Hitler to buy and sell so-called 'degenerate' and Jewish art to fund the party's activities during the 30s and 40s.

German prosecutors seized the art trove in February 2012 as part of a tax investigation after Gurlitt aroused the suspicion of German customs officials who stopped him on a train from Switzerland carrying a large sum of cash.

The collection, which includes works by Picasso, Matisse and Dix was discovered inside his Munich apartment

Under a new deal with prosecutors, art historians will have a year to examine the 1,401 works to establish where they came from and if they were stolen (pictured, a work by Otto Dix)

Under the terms of the new deal, the art will be held at a secret location for a year while historians carry out background checks on each of the paintings.

After the year is up any painting they cannot prove is stolen, or any painting which they have not finished studying, will be returned to Gurlitt.

Augsburg state prosecutor Matthias Nickolai said: 'We have come across new evidence in the course of the investigation ... that leads us to re-evaluate the legal situation.'

If investigators can prove a work was stolen then Gurlitt has agreed to return it to the rightful owners (pictured, one painting in the collection by Henri Matisse)

However if after a year the historians can't prove the work was stolen, or if they haven't finished their research, Gurlitt will receive the painting back. His spokesman today said he expected to keep between 300 and 350 of the pictures

Gurlitt's lawyer Tido Park applauded the decision to release the art, saying: 'It's a good day for Cornelius Gurlitt.'

The German government has come under fire - especially by families whose relatives were robbed by the Nazis - for keeping silent for almost two years about the trove of art works.

Gurlitt was arrested in 2012 but it wasn't until last year that knowledge of the collection became public.
