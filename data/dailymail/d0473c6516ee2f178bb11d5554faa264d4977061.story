Secret Service officers have apprehended a man who jumped over the White House's North Fence and appeared to be heading in the direction of the presidential residence.

President Obama was not in the White House at the time of the incident, as he and wife, First Lady Michelle Obama, were performing community service to commemorate the 13th anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks.

The incident occurred at 6.20pm local time, forcing the White House into a lockdown which ended less than an hour later.
