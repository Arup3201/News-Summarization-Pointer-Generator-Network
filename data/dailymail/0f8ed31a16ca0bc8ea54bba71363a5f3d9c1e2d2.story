Patients in England are four times more likely to receive new cancer drugs than those in Wales, according to ministers.

Government figures show 15,456 patients in England were given money last year by the Cancer Drugs Fund – which pays for treatments that have not yet been approved by NICE, the NHS rationing body.

This works out at 29 people per 100,000.

Life-saving treatment: Welsh patients are missing out on cancer drugs that English patients have funding for

The Labour-run Welsh Assembly, whose decision to provide free prescriptions left its budget squeezed, has so far refused to implement a similar scheme.

This means just 216 patients in Wales were given money for new cancer drugs by applying for exceptional NHS funding – or seven per 100,000 people.

As a result, some Welsh patients have even resorted to renting second homes across the English border to boost their chances of getting life-saving treatment.

Yvonne Briscow, 58, decided to take out a six-month lease on a flat in Stockport, 50 miles from her home in Brynford, North Wales, in the hope of getting access to funding for new bowel cancer drugs.

Ministers launched the £650million Cancer Drugs Fund three years ago.

Doctors apply on behalf of their patients to get any drug they believe will extend or enhance their lives.

But the fund was a temporary measure and is due to be wound-up in April.

The Government are getting ready to introduce a system of Value-Based Pricing next year, which is expected to give the green-light to more expensive cancer drugs.

Public health minister Anna Soubry said: ‘By protecting the NHS budget, we have been able to provide life-saving treatment to over 30,000 patients in England since the last election.

‘Welsh patients will be outraged that their Labour Government won’t offer the same service.’
