Leaving court: Dr Lucy Dawson got sick pay from one hospital, while working as a locum in others

A doctor accused of cheating the NHS out of £30,000 while on sick leave was caught out after boasting on Twitter that she was  earning ‘megabucks’, a court heard yesterday.

Although Dr Lucy Dawson was  signed off work with stress and depression for six months, she was also  allegedly moonlighting as an £800-a-day hospital locum.

The 45-year-old’s fraud trial heard that she was reported by Nick Jenkins – her former lover and boss, with whom she  had a 13-year affair – after their relationship ended ‘acrimoniously’.

His wife had spotted Dawson’s Twitter messages boasting that she was earning  ‘a stupid amount of dosh’.

The mother of two also bragged on the social messaging site about drinking  wine and a lifestyle of ‘nightshift Monday, debauchery Tuesday’, while still signed  off from her main job in the Royal Gwent Hospital’s casualty ward, Newport Crown Court was told.

Dawson is accused of claiming £29,320 in sick pay while earning £7,840 working in secret as a  stand-in doctor with neighbouring health authorities.

Her NHS employers were also forced to pay another £36,000 to locums who stood in for her in her main job as an accident and emergency specialist.

Dawson first went on sick leave in October 2009, claiming she had a ‘very bad head’.

But Newport Crown Court heard the prosecution claim she worked an eight-hour shift at Worcestershire Royal Hospital, earning £520.

Dawson then returned to work but went on sick leave just a month later, telling bosses she was stressed and suffering from depression.

It is claimed that she then worked another nine shifts at the Worcestershire hospital and at Hereford County Hospital, earning up to £840 for 12 hours.

Dr Nick Dawson blew the whistle on his ex-lover after his wife, Marianne (right) accessed Lucy Dawson's Twitter account and found a string of boasts about her alleged fraud

She mocked the NHS for paying her double to fill last-minute shifts, the court heard.

Prosecutor Carl Harrison said: ‘Dawson
was employed in the  accident and emergency department at the Royal 
Gwent Hospital in Newport.

‘While on fully paid leave she worked 
ten shifts at hospitals in Worcester and Hereford, earning £7,840. She 
was signed off from work with stress and depression but went on to the 
networking site Twitter.

Allegations: Dr Lucy Dawson has faced claims that she boasted of earning the huge sums while she was signed of work with sickness

‘She said that she was earning 
megabucks and a stupid amount of dosh. She also tweeted about drinking 
wine and other things such as “nightshift Monday, debauchery Tuesday”.’

The court heard Dawson also sent out 
Twitter messages about the Aneurin Bevan Health Board, her employer at 
the Newport hospital since 1989.

She tweeted, ‘They lie and bully people’ and said she could not work for people she ‘wanted to kill’.

While working at the Royal Gwent, Dawson had a 13-year affair with  her boss, emergency medicine  consultant Mr Jenkins.

The court heard the relationship was ‘a fairly well-known matter’ among their colleagues at the hospital.

The married doctor, 56, said the pair 
split up acrimoniously in  2006, before Dawson went off sick, and she 
started sending ‘unwanted communications’ to his wife and  her family.

Dr Jenkins’s wife Marianne, 53, began 
monitoring Dawson’s Twitter account and noticed her messages about 
working in other hospitals.

The father of five said he did not 
look at his ex-lover’s Twitter account and that it was his wife who had 
‘flagged up’ the messages to him.

He told the jury: ‘It was an 
acrimonious split and afterwards myself, my wife and my wife’s family 
began receiving unwanted communications from Lucy Dawson.

‘My wife would look at her Tweets to 
see if we could expect any more unwanted communications. She would do it
to gauge her mind-set.

‘My wife later showed me Twitter pages
with Lucy Dawson’s  comments on them. These were fully accessible to 
the public and showed up using an internet search.

Rebuttal: Dr Lucy Dawson says the allegations, made by a former lover, are untrue

‘My wife said to me: “Look it’s on 
Twitter that she’s working elsewhere.” I knew she was on sick  leave and
I heard she had been working at another hospital. I felt I had a 
professional obligation to deal with this so I called the fraud 
hotline.’

Dawson has since resigned from her job at the 800-bed hospital.

Alun Jenkins, defending, said she was genuinely depressed and stressed by ‘poisonous issues’ in the casualty department.

He described her as a ‘whistle-blower’
who had previously raised complaints about colleagues  failing to carry
out jobs properly.

Dawson, of Monmouth, South Wales, 
denies two charges of fraud relating to ten days of sick leave in 
October 2009 and a further six months from November that year.

The trial continues.
