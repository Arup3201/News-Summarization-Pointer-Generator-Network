World Cup-winning coach Marcello Lippi has retired from football management.

The 66-year-old Italian announced his decision on Sunday, after winning a third successive Chinese league title with Guangzhou Evergrande.

Lippi, who spent most of his playing career with Sampdoria, entered management in in 1982. He went on to coach 13 different teams including Italy, Juventus, Napoli and Inter.

1995: Wins Serie A, Coppa Italia and Supercopa with Juventus.

1996: Wins Champions League, European Super Cup and Intercontinental Cup with Juventus. 

1997: Wins Serie A and Supercopa with Juventus.

1998: Wins Serie A for third time with Juventus.

2002: Wins Serie A and Supercopa with Juventus.

2003: Wins Serie A and Supercopa with Juventus.

2006: Wins World Cup with Italy.

2012: Wins Chinese Super League and Chinese FA Cup with Guangzhou Evergrande.

2013: Wins Chinese Super League and Asian Champions League.

2014: Wins third consecutive Chinese Super League title.  

Lippi, the only coach in history to have won both the European and Asian versions of the Champions League, said: 'I don't want to coach any more, I'm too old. 

'Guangzhou Evergrande will have a new coach next season.'

He added that he will take over as technical director. 

Former Italy and Juventus defender Fabio Cannavaro is among the favourites to replace him as coach of the Chinese team.

Lippi steered Italy to World Cup success in 2006 where they defeated France in a final that will be remembered for Zinedine Zidane's headbutt on Italian defender Marco Materazzi.

Unfortunately for Lippi, he could not emulate that success in his second spell in charge of the Azzurri - they were eliminated in the group stage four years later in South Africa.

By far his most successful periods as a club manager came in Turin. In two spells at Juventus (1994-99 and 2001-04) Lippi won the Champions League, five Serie A titles, the Coppa Italia, Superopa Italiana, European Super Cup and Intercontinental Cup.

He also won the Serie A Coach of the Year three times while in charge of the The Old Lady. 

Lippi will become technical director of Guangzhou Evergrande, the team he has been managing since 2012
