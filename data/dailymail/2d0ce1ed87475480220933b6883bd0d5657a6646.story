When it comes to their big day, most brides hope it won’t be downhill all the way from here on in – unless, of course, you are Olympic skier Chemmy Alcott.

A pair of skis took pride of place as the downhill slalom star, who represented Britain four times in the Winter Olympics, married Scottish skier Dougie Crawford.

A guest dressed in tartan joined the celebrations at Syon House in West London on Friday carrying the skis decorated with Union Jacks.

It was proof that although Chemmy, 31, has announced her retirement from skiing, she has not left the piste far behind.

With her hair down and carrying a simple bouquet, Chemmy’s classic long white gown was a far cry  from the revealing outfits she wore on TV’s Dancing On Ice in 2012.

Chemmy and Dougie – who have dated for five years – are honeymooning in Tanzania.

That should be enough to melt the heart of even the coolest of skiers.
