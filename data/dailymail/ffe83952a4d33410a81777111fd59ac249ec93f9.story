The head coach of Australia's athletics team has been suspended indefinitely for slamming the country's biggest track and field star, plunging the team into a 'crisis of unprecedented proportions'.

Eric Hollingsworth launched an extraordinary attack on Olympic champion Sally Pearson on the eve of her Commonwealth Games 100m hurdles title defence.

He said Pearson had set a 'bad example' as team captain by declining to attend a pre-Games training camp in Gateshead, England.

Athletics Australia said on Thursday morning: 'We condem in the strongest terms his disparaging comments about Sally Pearson and his timing'.

'He acted without the authority of Athletics Australia and in contravention of the specific instructions of the chief executive officer,' a statement given to ABC added.

They confirmed they have suspended Hollingsworth until the board can consider the matter.

Hollingsworth said of Pearson: 'What's lost here is she's the team captain and there's a reasonable expectation she'd be in the camp ahead of something as major as the Commonwealth Games.

'Her no-show sets a bad example to the entire national team.'

Hollingsworth also defended his right to criticise Pearson's inability to defend the world indoors 60m hurdles title in March, after which their relationship broke down completely.

The comments about Pearson have sent Australian Athletics into a crisis

Former Commonwealth Games track and field medallist David Culbert said the comments had sparked a 'crisis of unprecedented proportions'

The comments have caused outrage among Australia's biggest sporting identities who are rallying behind Pearson.

Former Commonwealth Games track and field medallist David Culbert said the comments had sparked a 'crisis of unprecedented proportions', reported The Australian.

'I've seen plenty of stuff before in Australian athletics in the last two decades or so but this is the top of the tree I reckon,' he said.

'Having a head coach who leaks his statement on behalf of himself, when competition is underway, describing Sally Pearson, who everyone admires, as being a bad example is one of the most extraordinary things I have ever seen.

'If Eric Hollingsworth is still an employee of Athletics Australia or a member of the Australian Commonwealth Games team by the end of the day then I think the ramifications will continue.'

Pearson's manager Robert Joske confirmed on Twitter that the 27-year-old was ignoring the fiasco caused by the controversial comments.

'Sally is not following the drama! She is concentrating on her prep... Professional!', he tweeted.

Nova Peris, the first Aboriginal Australian to win an Olympic gold medal, has slammed Hollingsworth's comments as a 'disgraceful attack' and called Pearson an inspiration and a leader on Twitter.

Support for Pearson has also come from former U.S Olympic sprinter Michael Johnson, who weighed in by telling Channel 10 the timing of the comments was 'out of bounds'.

He added that Pearson would be able to remain unaffected in the lead up to her games campaign.

'When she's competing I don't think that anything else that happens on the planet really matters to her other than what's going on in the race. So I don't think this will affect her, but that's not the point,' he said.

'The point is that you don't make the comment the day before the competition. I think that was just absolutely out of bounds and it could affect an athlete, and it could affect Sally. I donâ€™t think it will, but I think that should have been taken into consideration before the statement was released.'

There are now calls for Commonwealth Games chef de mission Steve Moneghetti to try and stop the athletics team's derailing before its campaign starts.

Nova Peris also took to Twitter to rally behind the track star following the 'disgraceful attack'

Senior Athletics Australia officials are also furious with the timing and nature of Hollingsworth's comments.

The body has distanced itself by stating the comments do not reflect the views of Athletics Australia (AA).

'This statement was not made on behalf of Athletics Australia but by Hollingsworth as an individual and in no way should it be read as the opinion of Athletics Australia,' AA chief executive Dallas O'Brien said in a statement.

'Given Hollingsworth's current role as a head coach of athletics on the Australian Commonwealth Games Team, we will be meeting with the Australian Commonwealth Games Association urgently to formulate a strong response, as is appropriate.'

Senior AA executives were locked in an emergency meeting with Australian Commonwealth Games Association officials on Wednesday to decide whether Hollingsworth's position with the Games team remained tenable.

Hollingsworth's contract with AA runs out at the conclusion of the Games.

Pearson was furious that she was fined by AA for not attending the pre-Games training camp after deciding she would be better served by competing at an extra meet in London, having had her preparation interrupted by a hamstring injury.

Hollingsworth also took issue with claims from Pearson's camp that she had received less medical support from AA than had been the case in the past.

'We've had a team physio travelling with Sally for the past three months, following her around Europe,' he said.

'Since May we've provided this service, and there may have been one day or so where there's been an overlap when we've changed over personnel.

'To say we've withdrawn support is factually incorrect and a little disappointing.'

Hollingsworth said he felt compelled to speak out due to what he said was as 'a negative and incorrect picture of the events leading up to the Commonwealth Games'.

He insisted he asked 'legitimate questions' of Pearson after she was beaten into second place by American Nia Ali in the defence of her world indoor title in Poland.

'She didn't like the line I was taking,' said Hollingsworth.

'So via her agent she (sought) a meeting with Athletics Australia's president, CEO and High Performance Director, which I was not aware of until the day of, or day before the meeting.

'While I thought at the time it was curious that I wasn't involved in that process in any form, Sally raised her issues, and the powers-that-be found no problems with my actions, and there was no case to answer.

'Subsequently Sally dug her heels in, as is her right, and asked for what is a new athlete performance advisor which is the conduit between the athletes and Athletics Australia.'

Hollingsworth said that was the role he played with most athletes, but he had no issue with it being re-assigned to high performance director Simon Nathan in Pearson's case.

'We had a good working relationship for nearly a decade, but she decided my challenging style wasn't what she was looking for, which is her prerogative,' he said.
