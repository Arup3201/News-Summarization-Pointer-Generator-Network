Liverpool supporters will not appreciate the comparison but one of Sir Alex Ferguson’s great skills at Manchester United was to ensure that, on the whole, his stellar players left the club on his terms rather than their own.

Jaap Stam, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Roy Keane and even Cristiano Ronaldo, to an extent, all walked out of Old Trafford when Ferguson, and his club, were ready.

Whether Liverpool can adequately absorb the inevitable sense of loss that will accompany Steven Gerrard’s departure remains to be seen. Certainly his is a decision that, at this juncture, looks set to benefit him more than it does Liverpool.

To suggest that Liverpool, their chief executive Ian Ayre and manager Brendan Rodgers, have mismanaged the Gerrard situation over the last 12 months would be a little unfair. Managing contractual issues with a club’s biggest player is not always easy.

United themselves discovered this with Wayne Rooney.

Nevertheless, it is clear that Gerrard was upset he had been allowed to reach the onset of winter without receiving a firm offer to remain at Anfield. He pretty much said so in newspaper interviews in November.

Whether this has contributed to his decision to leave only he will know, but what is more clear is that the decision speaks volumes for the Anfield captain’s feelings about his club’s chances of significant success on the field over the next 18 months.

Had Gerrard genuinely felt Rodgers was likely to lead Liverpool back in to contention in the Barclays Premier League next season then it is hard to imagine he would have left.

His close friend Jamie Carragher has already made that mistake, after all. That he has decided to pursue options abroad while his legs can still carry him forward says a lot for his views on the immediate prospects of Rodgers’ squad.

Plenty of words have been spoken this season about Gerrard’s longevity. Questions have been asked about his capabilities at the highest level and it was interesting to see Liverpool produce one of their better Premier League performances — beating Swansea 4-1 — last Monday without him in the team.

Do not be fooled, though. Gerrard remains fundamental to Liverpool, on and off the field. In his absence, there is no natural successor as captain and — with respect to the likes of Daniel Sturridge and Raheem Sterling — there is no marquee player left behind.

It is the first time in a long time we have said this. Even during the lean years there was Robbie Fowler, Michael Owen or Fernando Torres.

Without Gerrard, the current Liverpool squad lacks world-class stardust and, given what they threatened to achieve in the Premier League only eight months ago, that is quite remarkable.

Brendan Rodgers will have to plan for the future at Liverpool without Gerrard 

This is not the end for Rodgers’ Anfield project. Liverpool have a talented manager and some very good footballers.

However, the fact this great club has reached this inevitable crossroads a year earlier than anybody ever really expected is something they may yet have cause to regret.
