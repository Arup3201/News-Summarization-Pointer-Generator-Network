She already owns a successful haircare range - and never steps out without a perfect bouncy blow-dry - so it was only a matter of time before Tamara Ecclestone launched a chain of salons.

The Formula One heiress and founder of Show Beauty is set to expand the haircare brand she founded last year by adding a chain of blow-dry bars - Show Dry - across the UK, Ireland and United Arab Emirates.

The new mother has been working on the salons for 12 months and says they will take cues from the luxurious feel of sumptuous interiors, the service of sleek designer boutiques and exclusivity of private members clubs for a 'truly integrated experience.'

Speaking about her new venture, 30-year-old Tamara said: 'Show Beauty was conceptualised to offer people a unique and opulent alternative, superior to anything they have tried before, and therefore Show Dry is a perfect natural extension of the brand. 

'As a working wife and new mother I know how hard it is to look and feel great when you don’t have much time and Show Dry aims to provide a slick, time efficient service that allows all women the time to feel fabulous no matter how much time you "don’t have".'

The socialite has taken every last detail into consideration and for someone with a taste for the finer things in life, you can expect iPads, flexible opening hours, valet parking, exclusive loyalty programmes, a  healthy menu, and even a personal driver service to protect newly styled hair.

Despite the swanky surroundings, getting your hair styled a la Tamara will only set you back between £18-£45.

Tamara and her team have plans to introduce further concessions across the UK, including the full Harvey Nichols portfolio as well as Fenwicks and House of Fraser over the next twelve months. 

It's been a busy few months for the mother-of-one, who is set to star in her own fly-on-the-wall documentary.

The star has also been showcasing a trim figure despite giving birth to her first child, Sophia, in March.

Speaking about her post-baby body, she told new! magazine: 'I think a lot of it is breastfeeding because I haven't worked out since having Sophia.'

'I'm not drinking because I'm breastfeeding, so that's a lot of calories, and I'm a lot more healthy now because everything I eat, she eats and I want what's best for her.

'I've given up coffee, Diet Coke, dairy... and everything is organic. And I was just lucky that I didn't put on much weight when I was pregnant, so there wasn't that much to lose.'

She also said that not every single part of her body has become smaller since becoming a mum.

'My mum said she was really skinny when she was breastfeeding so I think that's a part of it.

'Annoyingly my boobs are bigger because I'm breastfeeding, so there are loads of things I can't wear.' 

Luxurious: Tamara launched Show Beauty last year and it includes dry shampoos and styling essentials, priced at around £35 per product
