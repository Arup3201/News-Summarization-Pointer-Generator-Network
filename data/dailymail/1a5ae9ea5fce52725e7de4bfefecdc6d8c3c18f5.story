With a plush shower and wood-paneled floor this 'supershed' isn't the traditional back garden retreat where dads to go for a potter.

From the outside it looks unremarkable, but this flat-roofed brick building has been dubbed London's most expensive shed after going on the market for just under £260,000.

The incredible asking price reflects the property's location in upmarket Highgate village which has recently seduced Kate Moss and Jude Law to buy properties in the area.

It also comes with a kitchenette and skylights and estate agents have described it as an 'unusual property'.

But at £259,950, it is almost 10 times the average London salary of just over £27,000, and the new owner will only be able to spend a couple of nights a week there due to a clause in its lease.

Mark Newton, associate sales director at Taylor Newton, which is selling the 250 sq ft property, said: 'It was an old barn and there are restrictions to how many nights a week you can sleep there.

'It is a niche market — I have had a couple of artists interested in using it as a studio, or it could be a crash pad for someone who was only in London part time.'

Experts are divided over whether it is good value. Nicholas Leeming, a director of property website Zoopla, said: 'The question is whether anyone is willing to overlook the limitations of a property like this for the sake of a prime location.'

However, Peter Rollings, chief executive of Marsh & Parsons, said: 'It is a bit wacky, but it is a stand-alone property. You could pay £500,000 for a studio flat in Kensington and Chelsea.'

The sale starkly illustrates the  price gap between property in prime London locations and other parts of the capital and Britain.

A few miles east, near the Olympic Park in Stratford, you can buy a house for £260,000 from Clarke Hillyer.

In Halstead, Essex, a penthouse in a church is for sale with John D Wood for £259,950, complete with stained-glass windows.

In Devon, a cottage near Kingsbridge  — for sale with Mansbridge & Balment for £260,000 —  boasts a barn almost as big as the London shed.
