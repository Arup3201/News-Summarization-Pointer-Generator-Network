They are typically found floating in the ocean's depths - so just how did this octopus end up 978m above sea level at the peak of England's tallest mountain?

A team of litter pickers carrying out a clean-up on Scafell Pike were left baffled when they came across the body of a dead octopus nestled on the rocks close to the mountain's summit.

Mystery surrounds the manner in which the dead sea creature came to land on the lofty perch in the Lake District - with some suggesting the cephalopod was dropped by a bird after being scooped up from the Irish Sea.

Mystery: The dead octopus was discovered by a team of litter pickers carrying out a clean-up near the summit of Scafell Pike - England's highest mountain

It would have taken a powerful bird to haul the octopus - which measured around 10 inches from the top of its head to the tip of its tentacles - so high in the air.

The Cumbria beauty spot is home to nesting Osprey, and sea eagles have recently begun to colonise the area thanks to a breeding programme in Scotland.

But Dave Ascough, who discovered the dead creature, suspects its presence on top of the mountain may have been the result of a prank.

Bizarre: Could a bird have dropped the dead sea creature at the summit of the Scafell Pike in the Lake District?

'It appeared quite fresh, but I suppose it could have been someone's idea of a joke,' he said.

'If not that, it raises the question of why the bird would carry it all the way up the top of the mountain and then lose it and not eat it.

'But I am not an ornithologist, so it remains a mystery,' he said.

Mr Ascough, from Stockport, was taking a party of volunteers up Scafell Pike to clear away litter left by other visitors when he stumbled across the bizarre find.

The trained mountain leader, who said swathes of litter is left behind on the mountain by tourists and climbers taking part in the popular Three Peaks Challenge, said his team brought ten black bags of rubbish down with them off Scafell Pike that day - including the octopus.

'It is easily the most unusual thing we have found on Scafell Pike - we were quite surprised when we came across it,' he said.

'We were just at the summit cairn where it was quite windy and misty and I saw something on a rock which I thought was a child's toy - a teddy bear or a glove puppet. But on going over to it I realised it was a dead octopus.

'Last year on Ben Nevis I did find a
whole trout in a carrier bag near the summit cairn. So my first 
reaction when I saw the octopus was that someone carried it up as some 
kind of as a prank.

'Then
I gave it some thought and realised it was possible that a bird had 
somehow dropped it, though it would have to have been a big bird.'

The
octopus was put into a black sack and disposed of with the rest of the 
rubbish, by being dumped in a skip at the foot of the mountain.

Theories: An octopus in its usual habitat - swimming through the ocean
