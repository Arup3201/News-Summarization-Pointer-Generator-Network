Comedian Frankie Boyle was awarded more than £54,000 damages today after a High Court jury found he had been libelled by a newspaper which had described him as 'racist'.

The jury concluded that Mr Boyle, 40, from Glasgow, had been defamed by the Daily Mirror.

After the verdict, the comedian gave a V-for-Victory sign on the court steps and revealed that he would be donating the money to charity.

Mr Boyle said he had sued because he had always 'made a point' of being 'anti-racist'.

He had claimed that a Daily Mirror article published on July 19 last year defamed him by describing him as 'Racist comedian Frankie Boyle' and saying he had been 'forced to quit' BBC panel show Mock The Week.

Daily Mirror publisher Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) defended the article, arguing that the 'racist' description was either true or 'honest comment on a matter of public interest'.

MGN also argued that the words 'forced to quit' did not mean that Mr Boyle had been sacked and were not defamatory.

But jurors ruled in Mr Boyle's favour after a week-long trial in London.

They awarded Mr Boyle £50,400 damages for the 'racist' assertion and a further £4,250 in relation to the claim that he was 'forced to quit' the BBC show.

Mr Boyle was also awarded legal costs, estimated to be in the region of £100,000.

During the hearing, the jury was shown a series of the comedian's jokes from Mock The Week and his Channel 4 show Tramadol Nights.

After the verdict, Mr Boyle tweeted: 'I'm very happy with the jury's decision and their unanimous rejection of the Mirror's allegation that I am a racist.

'Racism is still a very serious problem in society which is why I've made a point of always being anti-racist in my life and work and that's why I brought this action.'

MGN lawyers had told jurors that Mr 
Boyle was a 'racist comedian' who gratuitously exploited negative 
stereotypes of black people for 'cheap laughs'.

A barrister representing MGN, Ronald Thwaites QC, said the comedian was 'callous' and 'insensitive'.

He
 said jurors should not find in the comedian's favour but, if they did, 
they should show their 'contempt' by awarding damages of 45p - the price
 of a copy of the Daily Mirror.

Mr Boyle denied 'punctuating' material with racist references or making 'gratuitous' use of black people.

He told jurors that characters he played might express racist views, but he did not.

He
 said he actively campaigned against racism and parodied racists - and 
claimed that the Daily Mirror had 'misunderstood' the context of his use
 of language in jokes.

Mr
 Boyle's counsel, David Sherborne, told the court that the comedian's 
humour was 'deliberately challenging', and he would not have minded if 
his material had been called 'vile', 'tasteless' or 'offensive', because
 that 'went with the territory'.

But he did object to being called a 'racist', Mr Sherborne added.
