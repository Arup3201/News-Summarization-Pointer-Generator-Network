National Australia Bank advertising campaign which tells customers to ditch their 'sensible side'Â  and 'treat themselves a little' by spending on their credit card is under fire from customers.

The bank has been sending customers handwritten, personally addressed letters from their 'sensible side' urging them to embrace their 'impulsive side' and get a new credit card to treat themselves to a little retail therapy.

One letter addressed to a Queensland teenager explicitly encourages her to apply for a new credit card because its low-cost benefits means she will be able 'enjoy some retail therapy.'

Mari-Anna Reiljan-Dillon said she was 'insulted' when she received her personally letter from the NAB

Ms Reiljan-Dillon's letter detailed the very reasons why she was not suitable for the bank's low-fee credit card and how she felt about the campaign

The letters have motivated angry customers to bombard the NAB's Facebook page and other websites in which they have labelled the campaign 'condescending and insulting'.

One Toowoomba father wrote to The Chronicle criticising the bank for sending the letter to his 19-year-old daughter, Rebekah.

Another customer, Mari-Anna Reiljan-Dillon, took the time to write her own handwritten reply back to the bank, claiming the campaign makes a mockery of individual customer choices.

Ms Reiljan-Dillon wrote that as a prudent money-manager and savvy investor, it was an 'insult' to receive the letter from her bank.

She said the letter made a mockery of her own intelligence.

'To imply that I do not know how to manage my own finances responsibly, and then even worse, to suggest that I would consider getting a credit card to be sensible. How little intelligence do you think I have?' she wrote.

Many other customers, such as Mary O'Brien, feel let down about the bank's marketing strategy and the messages contained in it

There's been no shortage of negative reaction to the campaign on Facebook

One customer addressed her concern's to the general manager of the big Australian financial firm

A spokesman for the NAB said invitations to take up the credit card offer are 'only extended to customers that we expect can manage that credit.'

'The campaign letter is sent to existing NAB customers that have established a good banking history with NAB,' The spokesman said.

He said the letter used in the campaign 'highlights the smart ways to reduce credit card interest - which is usually topical at end of financial year.'

Another long-term NAB customer, Mary O'Brien, 52, who has experience in marketing, said while it might be a smart campaign it was also 'insulting, condescending and poorly targeted.'

'I don't have credit card debt and I don't have a problem with my impulsive side,' she said.

She said it was 'rude' of the bank she had been trusting with her finances for more than 40 years to suggest she should rely on a new credit card.

Ms O'Brien also said there was an underlying ethical problem to the pitch because it suggested that everybody has a problem with managing their finances, even if they are debt-free.

It is not known how many complaints have been made, but there are several other social media posts directed to the bank's Facebook page of people detailing their dismay.

According to creditcard.com.au the total balance held on Australian credit cards with an interest-free period as of February 2014 was $45 billion.

The company said this was a slight increase from the same time last year and in her letter Mari-Anna Reiljan-Dillon pointed to Australia's escalating credit card debt.

'Do you know how many Australians are weighed down with credit card debts they are unsure of ever being able to repay? But of course you do, and that is why you are trying to milk me for all the interest you can.'

She said she would happily ignore and decline every future credit card application the bank tried to entice her to make in the future.
