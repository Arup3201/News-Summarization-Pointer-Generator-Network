Dani King thought she was dying. Lying in the back of an ambulance, she was struggling for breath, in agony and unable to feel her feet. She began to panic that her body was shutting down.

‘It was horrible,’ she says. ‘I just remember looking into these really bright lights in the ambulance and thinking: “I’m too young”.’

An hour earlier she had been descending on her bike on a rain-soaked road in south Wales. It was part of a training regime designed to give her the endurance to secure a second Olympic gold. She won gold in 2012 in the team pursuit with Laura Trott and Joanna Rowsell and is looking for a repeat in Brazil in 2016.

But a rider to her left hit a pothole at more than 30mph and lost control, taking King with him as he hit the tarmac. Riding behind her was a former rugby player weighing over 16 stone. Unable to avoid the 24-year-old, his front wheel rammed into King’s side before he too was thrown off his bike.

The impact left King with eight broken ribs and a punctured lung. Had a bone fragment damaged another organ it could have been far more serious. Even so, she had to spend two days in intensive care and a further 10 on a ward.

Sitting here in a London hotel only 10 days after she was discharged from hospital, it is hard to believe this is the same person. She seems fit and well, not a scratch on view, even if she admits to feeling apprehensive about getting back on a bike on the road.

‘We were about 100km into the ride,’ she says. ‘It was really bad weather, raining and cold. We were riding two abreast and a guy to my left hit a pothole and fell right into the group. I just hit him and went over my bars. A rider behind me rode into by back. That’s what did the damage really. It was bad luck.’ King thinks it was an hour before the first ambulance arrived.

‘When they did arrive there were two people with head injuries who needed help first,’ she says. ‘They were discharged later that day, but it meant I was the last to get in an ambulance.

‘It was carnage, horrible. I was in the road for over an hour, cold in the rain. I was aware straight away that I’d done something to my lung. I could only take the tiniest breaths. And I could feel my ribs grinding together.

‘I went into survival mode. I wasn’t crying, I was in so much pain, but because I knew I’d done something serious I realised I needed to stay calm and get the oxygen into my lung.’

A shot of morphine enabled the paramedics to lift her on to a spinal board and into the ambulance.

The mother of her boyfriend, the fellow professional cyclist Matt Rowe, had driven to the scene after receiving a phone call and joined her in the ambulance.

‘I genuinely thought I was going to die,’ she says. ‘I couldn’t feel my feet, and while they’d given me all the painkillers I could have I just couldn’t breathe. There was a scary moment in casualty too. My heart rate went from 50 to 150 in a split second. The doctors told Matt and his mum to leave the room and pulled the curtains round and called the doctor. Thankfully it must have just been a bit of shock.’

A scan revealed the collapsed lung. ‘I had to go straight into theatre to have a chest drain put in,’ she says. ‘They put the drain — this tube the width of a hosepipe — into the lung to remove the liquid and re-inflate the lung. And I had to have an epidural too because they said I wouldn’t be able to deal with the pain.’

She has proved a fast healer, and the doctors have said she will make a complete recovery. But some mental scars remain. ‘When I was on the floor I said, “I’m never going to ride a bike again”,’ she says. ‘I was thinking, “Is this actually worth it?” But it wasn’t long before I thought, “no, I will”.

‘That said, I will probably still be a bit worried about getting on a bike again. I wouldn’t be human if I wasn’t. I have suffered a significant trauma and it happened riding a bike.

‘My liver was bruised. The consultant told me that if one of the pieces of bone had become dislodged I would have had a 50 per cent chance of living. I was shown a 3D image of my bones. It was a mess.

‘I will find it hard getting back on the bike on the road. Especially in groups, in bad weather.

‘I’m sure it will come back (her confidence on the bike). It’s going to have to. Matt and I are planning to go on holiday somewhere warm where I can just ride and enjoy it.

‘Then when I come back I’ll start on my training plan, the aim being January 1 (the accident was on November 6). It might mean I miss a couple of early-season races but it won’t disrupt anything.’

King makes a point about the state of Britain’s roads, and the fact that other countries do invest more in cycling. Something like £2 per person in this country, according to the national cycling charity CTC, compared to £35 in Holland and Denmark. The pothole that caused the accident was a monster, measuring one foot long, almost a foot wide and two inches deep.

‘We do a lot of training in Majorca and I don’t think I’ve ever needed to shout “pothole”,’ she says.

But her focus is now very much on the future. On more success, and more Olympic gold.

‘I hope this experience makes me stronger,’ she says. ‘I can’t just sit at home and cry. I have cried, don’t get me wrong.

‘And I’m still struggling to sleep, because I’m injured on the side I sleep — on my right. But I also feel I’m lucky.

‘In intensive care I was the only one who was conscious. I could see there were lots of people an awful lot worse off than me.

‘Winning gold in London was the pinnacle for a lot of top sports people but I am really determined.

‘I want to make Rio. This is just another setback, another bump in the road. If I do make it, it will make the journey that bit more special.’
