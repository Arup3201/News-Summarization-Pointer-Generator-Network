Andrea Pirlo has revealed he will continue playing for Italy.

The 35-year-old had hinted he would retire after the World Cup but says he changed his mind after a conversation with new Italy boss Antonio Conte.

Pirlo is not with the Italy squad preparing for Juventus' game against Sampdoria this weekend, but says he hopes to be part of the next squad.

‘I spoke to Conte, he asked me to be part of the Azzurri family again and I accepted. So hopefully I’ll be with them for their next training camp,’ he told Gazzetta TV.

‘It was a difficult decision for me. I wanted to quit playing for Italy, but then Conte came to me and asked me for help. I’m happy to do so and I hope we’ll do well.’

Pirlo also backed former boss Conte – who led Juventus to three successive Serie A titles to turn Italy’s fortunes around after a disappointing World Cup that saw them beat England 2-1 but fail to qualify for the second stage.

‘He has everything he needs to be successful,’ the Juventus’ playmaker added. 

‘He gave his team a new identity in just a few days, and that was very difficult after such a devastating World Cup.

‘He needs time, one match isn’t enough to evaluate a team, but Conte and his staff are working to create a national team that makes the fans proud and happy to watch their games.’

Pirlo is currently the fourth most-capped player in ltaly history with 112 appearances but is currently sidelined with a hip injury.
