If you've had your fill of exciting times, then pack up and head for Lubbock, Texas - voted America's most boring place to live in a recent survey.

The West Texas town - famous for its dearth of music venues and restaurants - was ranked number one in a list compiled by real estate agents, Movoto.

A close second was North Las Vegas, Nevada, a city which celebrated the ground-breaking of its new corporate center earlier this month but has no nightlife to speak of.

Welcome to Lubbock, voted America's most boring town in a recent realtors' survey based on its lack of restaurants and things to do. Pictured, is the Texas town's cone grain elevator

In third place, is Chesapeake, Virginia, where life appears to flow along at a sedate place, according to the realtors' survey

The Motovo Real Estate survey analyzed the 100 most-populated places in the U.S. and came up with the 50 most boring based on factors from aging population to amusement parks 

Third, fourth and fifth places were taken by Chesapeake, Virginia; Irving, Texas and Fort Wayne, Indiana respectively. 

Although Chesapeake is scenic and good for those who love the outdoors, forget it if you are a music lover. 

Despite having a fifth of the populate under the age of 34, there is a scarcity of bars and restaurants. Sports fans were also left disappointed with the Dallas Cowboys pulled out in 2010.

Then there's Fort Wayne, Indiana. While it does do well when it comes to festivals and local sports games, when those aren't happening there's a lot of time for twiddling your thumbs.

The realtors' survey analyzed the 100 most heavily-populated places in the U.S. and then compiled the 50 most boring based on so-called 'Saturday Night Science' - looking at the number of clubs, bars, restaurants and entertainment venues, like theaters and amusement parks. 

Each place was ranked on various factors, using a scale one to 100 (the higher the score, the more boring it is). 

The figures were compiled using the business listings in the 2010 U.S. Census.

The percentage of aging population in each location was also taken into consideration.  

The top ten most boring towns, according to the survey, were rounded off with Plano, Texas; San Bernardino, California; Stockton, California; Mesa, Arizona and Laredo, Texas.

Motovo, a real estate agency, has analyzed other segments of American life in surveys including 'The 10 Smartest Suburbs', the  'The 10 Happiest Small Places' and 'The 10 Mid-size Places With The Prettiest People'.

Stockton, California (pictured) had a bad reputation when it came to nightlife, so not really the natural home of party-lovers

Laredo, Texas (the post office is pictured) was the fourth Texas location to make it into the top ten. It had the worst rep for arts on the entire list
