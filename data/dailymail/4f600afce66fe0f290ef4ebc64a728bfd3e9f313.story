A food artist has immortalised a slew of celebrities including Holly Willoughby, Julia Roberts, Kate Middleton and David Beckham,using eggs, four and milk - just in time for Pancake Day.

Nathan Shields, a stay-at-home father and former mathematics teacher, has created a portfolio of pancake portraits  of celebrities using a squeezy bottle of batter as his paint.

And he's been busy, capturing A listers including  Cheryl Cole, Emma Bunton, Tess Daley, Anna Wintour, Alan Sugar and Victoria Beckham.

Mr Shields, from Houston, Texas, created the portraits for Lyle's Golden Syrup to mark Shrove Tuesday on 17 February.

Using a squeezy mustard or ketchup bottle, his freehand drawing skills are truly a sight to behold.

Using two types of batter - a plain flour mix and a chocolate version - he skillfully sketches out the outline of the celebrity.  

As the pancake cooks and becomes darker, he works against the clock to fill in the surrounding areas of the pan with details such as the hair and facial features like the eyes, nose and mouth. 

The surrounding areas of the pancake are further filled in before he quickly flips the pancake over to show the finished result. 

But there are far more astonishing pancake themes on his website Saipancakes.com, from tropical birds, exotic seashells, animal tracks, as well as Winnie the Pooh and Star Wars characters.

Mr Shields said it was his mother who first inspired his craft, having grown up with her making 'monster pancakes' for him as a child.  

However, he does admit it getting more challenging to come up with new pancake themes.

'It's getting harder and harder to come up with them but people are recommending them on my website,' he said to Good Day Sacremento.

Mr Shields may have got the famously unsmiling Victoria Beckham's expression right but he could have done better with her hairstyle, which is at least ten years out of date

Outside of that, his hardest theme he's accomplished so far he says was his capture of a series of marine invertebrates seen on his blog.

His portfolio of pancake images on his website boasts a broad range of topics including themes from science, nature and popular culture.

Mr Shields began posting videos to YouTube last year to spread pancake love around the globe.

Mr Shields has also created pancake portraits of characters from the The Hobbit 

Mr Shields created the portraits for Lyle's Golden Syrup to mark Shrove Tuesday on 17 February.

Research was conducted by Lyle's Golden Syrup to uncover the most famous celebrity smiles .  

Sara Harrison at Lyle's Golden Syrup said: 'We want to encourage people to have a bit of fun this Pancake Day, get creative and spread smiles in the kitchen. 

'SaiPancakes is the perfect partner to help us inspire people to do this and the brilliant 'pan-portraits' he has created for us are as delicious as they are beautiful.'
