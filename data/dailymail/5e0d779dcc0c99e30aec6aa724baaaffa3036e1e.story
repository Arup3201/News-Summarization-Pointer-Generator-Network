Activists clashed with police yesterday after nine days of protest failed to stop drilling at a rural site earmarked for possible fracking.

A 19-year-old woman and a man were arrested on suspicion of assaulting police as the energy company Cuadrilla started an exploratory borehole at the site.

Protesters from across the UK have descended on the outskirts of the tiny village of Balcombe, West Sussex, which has become the focus of the campaign against fracking.

Anger: Protesters clashed with police during the ninth day of protest against fracking in West Sussex

Clashes: A man and a woman were arrested on suspicion of assaulting a police officer following clashes at Balcombe

Trouble: A police officer grapples with a protester at Balcombe earlier this afternoon

Shocking: A protester has her hair pulled as tensions rise during the ninth day of campaigns against fracking in West Sussex

Keeping calm: A man is led away by police during this afternoon's protests

Restrained: Two policemen pin this man down as clashes erupt at the anti-fracking protest today

Drilling finally began at the site shortly after 11am yesterday.  

Police formed a line of protection as trucks carrying supplies and equipment were driven inside.

Officers were seen using a saw to 
remove a man chained to the ladder of a fire engine which had been used 
as a makeshift blockade to the site’s entrance.

Protesters waving anti-fracking banners, including many women and children, had earlier blocked the road leading to the site.

Hydraulic fracturing – fracking – 
involves pumping liquid at high pressure deep underground to split shale
 rock and release gas for use as fuel.

Forcing through: Protesters stand on the road as police officers escort a lorry to the entrance gate of a site run by Cuadrilla Resources outside the village of Balcombe

Placards: A demonstrator makes her feelings clear during the protests today

Finally started: A police line escorts a truck through protesters at the site of drilling being carried out by an energy company in West Sussex this morning

Ready to begin: A truck carrying equipment is pictured making its way to the site despite fierce protests

Still campaigning: Protesters stand in front of police after they had escorted a lorry onto the West Sussex site

Opponents of the method have 
highlighted concerns about potential water contamination and  
environmental damage, as well as the possibility of triggering 
small-scale earthquakes. Environmentalists say the potential benefits of
 shale gas and oil – such as cheaper energy bills – have been 
overstated.

Cuadrilla has started drilling a 3,000ft vertical well in a project lasting up to three months.

Chief executive Francis Egan says the 
firm has ‘no intention of ruining the countryside and won’t ruin the 
countryside’ and has no plans to start fracking.

But villagers fear it will begin to use the controversial technique at some point in the future.

More than 30 people have been arrested at the site, mainly on suspicion of obstructing deliveries.

They include Natalie Hynde, 30, the daughter of musicians Ray Davies and Chrissie Hynde.

Worried: Protesters gathered at the site for a ninth consecutive day

Forlorn: Despite the best efforts of protesters, exploratory drilling begun today

Fears: Campaigners are worried about the possible effects of fracking, or hydraulic fracturing

Demonstration over: Police cut a protester free this morning after he had chained himself to the ladder of a fire engine that was being used as a blockade at the site entrance

Cut free: The man was then led away from the top of the fire engine by police

The 19-year-old woman arrested 
yesterday is from Portsmouth, police said. She had claimed to be 14 when
 arrested but police confirmed she was older.

The man arrested, who is aged 22 and 
from Bexhill, East Sussex, was held after an officer was hit by a 
placard. Both remained in custody last night.

Superintendent Lawrence Hobbs said: ‘My officers are there to allow protesters to safely and peacefully protest.

‘We also need to uphold the right of the company to operate and bring their vehicles on to the site.

‘The vast majority of the protesters 
feel very passionately about this issue and are protesting peacefully. 
If protesters do become violent they should understand that this is not 
acceptable and they will be arrested.’

Blockade: The fire engine had been parked across the entrance to the West Sussex site where drilling has now started

Chained up: Demonstrators had chained themselves to the decommissioned fire truck until police brought in cutting equipment to move them on

On the march: A woman pushes a pram past a line of police that surrounded a decommissioned fire engine used as a blockade

Moved on: A recovery vehicle was eventually brought in to move the truck out of the way and pave the way for equipment and supplies to be delivered to the site

Kathryn McWhirter, of No Fracking in 
Balcombe Society, said: ‘It is of huge national importance that we all 
stand up against this dangerous coalition of the petrochemical industry 
with our Government.’

Vanessa Vine, of Frack Free Sussex, 
said: ‘This is a violation of our geology that could threaten our water,
 fresh air and our children.

‘I cannot comprehend why the people in
 Government who are supposedly responsible for protecting the people 
have not only allowed this, but forced this through.’

Earlier this week former Government 
energy adviser Lord Howell apologised for suggesting fracking could be 
used in the ‘desolate’ North East of England without the environmental 
impact it might have in the South East.

Front line: Women and children pictured protesting against tests that they fear will lead to fracking this morning

Disruption: Drilling had been delayed for several days due to fierce protests at the site

Entertaining: A protester plays the bagpipes close to a line of police as equipment is escorted through blockades by police

In for the long haul: Campaigners begun a ninth day of protests at the gates of the West Sussex site earlier today

Danger: Campaigners described the start of exploratory drilling today as a 'threat to our geology'

Safeguarding their future: Rory aged seven and his friend Jasmin, also seven, years old have been among protesters trying to stop drilling by the energy firm

Desperate measures: Natalie Hynde, daughter of the Kinks' Ray Davies, and her partner Simon Medhurst glued themselves together at the site gates
