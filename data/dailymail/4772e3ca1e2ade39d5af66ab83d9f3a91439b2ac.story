Marie Holmes first day as a multi-millionaire started off as normally as possible - making breakfast for her four kids and aimlessly checking Facebook. 

It was when she was scrolling through her feed though that life changed forever. 

A friend posted the winning numbers to the $564million Powerball, so 26-year-old Holmes went and fetched her tickets. 

When she noticed that all the numbers matched she started screaming so loud that her three daughters and son thought something was wrong.

'I started screaming and stuff and my kids ran away from me and said I scared them...they ran into the next room,' Ms Holmes said on Good Morning America on Tuesday.

Powerball winnter Marie Holmes appeared on Good Morning America on Tuesday and discussed the moment she realized she won $188million 

Ms Holmes was cooking breakfast for her children and reading Facebook when she saw a post with the winning numbers, and saw that one of her tickets matched

Ms Holmes says she then called her mother and told her to come over, saying: 'I think I got the matching numbers'. She fave her mother $15 to buy five tickets on the way to church, and later bought five more.  

When her mother arrived, they checked the numbers again and this time Ms Holmes had to run outside to release her utter excitement.  

Ms Holmes accepted a check for a lump-sum payment $188million on Monday in a press conference in her home state of North Carolina.

But even though her newfound fortune is in the bank, the reality of her life as a millionaire still hasn't sunk in. 

'I still don't believe it,' she told GMA. 'I don't know when I'm actually going to believe it.' 

Ms Holmes, a single mother, plans to spend her money getting her mother a new house, fixing up her gradmother's house and setting up college funds for her children. 

But she insists she won't spoil the kids. 

'They're not going to get everything they want,' she said. 'They're going to learn. It's a learning process.'

She plans to use the money to buy a new house for her mother, fix up her grandmother's house and set up a college fund for her children

While she plans to spend some of the money travelling, Ms Holmes is also eager to get back in the classroom and finish her education. She plans to study nursing. 

Holmes, one of three winners of the historic $564million jackpot, announced her winnings to a local news station two weeks ago.  

Holmes and her family live in a trailer in Shallotte, North Carolina — just north of South Carolina on the coast. 

She used to work at McDonald's and Walmart before quitting to take care of her children.

Her four children, Brayden, Charisma, Andrea and Ebony, are aged from nine months to seven years old. Brayden is believed to suffer from cerebral palsy.

Holmes sacrificed her education to care for her four children and took minimum wage jobs to provide for her family.

With little or no help from the fathers of her four young children, she has struggled financially for most of her adult life.

Ms Holmes is a single-mother to four children - three daughters and a son ages 9-months to 7-years-old

It's beleived that Ms Holmes son has cerebral palsey. She intends to donate to a foundation that researches the disease 

Holmes has also seen her own father repeatedly jailed and her favorite cousin shot and left paralyzed after a home invasion. 

Family members  describe Holmes as a loving mother who always put her children first.

'Marie is very grounded and she will know what to do with all that money,' said her uncle William Bryant.

'I'm sure she will want to buy a new home for herself and her kids, but I can't see any extravagant purchases. She's a nice girl who loves her family and loves her church.' 

Holmes has little contact with the two fathers of her four children. The three eldest are with her former high school sweetheart who now lives in California.

Her youngest child is with a local man but friends say he is not involved in his daughter's life. 

Lottery officials said her winning ticket was sold at a convenience store in Shallotte. It is the fourth time that a North Carolina ticket has claimed a Powerball jackpot. In North Carolina, a winner has 180 days from the drawing to claim the prize.

The winning numbers were: 11, 13, 25, 39, 54 and the Powerball 19. 

Holmes's winning line was the fourth of the 'quick picks'. The odds of winning the Powerball are one in 175million.

The gas station she bought the ticket at will get $50,000 as a retailer incentive award. 

Another ticket-holder from the February 11 drawing in Puerto Rico has elected to remain anonymous, while the owner of a winning ticket sold in Texas has not yet come forward. 

The Texas Lottery posted on Twitter that one of the winning tickets was sold at Appletree Food Mart in Princeton, a city about 40 miles north of Dallas.

This is the trailer where Ms Holmes lives with her four children - but odds are she'll be upgrading soon 

She used to work at McDonald's and Walmart before quitting to take care of her children. 

It had been nearly a year since a Powerball prize reached the giant number people have come to expect recently. That was last February, when someone won $425.3million.

The February 11 jackpot was the third-largest in Powerball history and the fifth-largest U.S. lottery prize. 

The last time a Powerball jackpot climbed so high was May 2013, when a Florida ticket won a $590.5million prize.

The largest payout in U.S. history was to three ticketholders in the Mega Millions game, the other national lottery drawing. 

That was a $656million prize won in March 2012 by players in Kansas, Illinois and Maryland.

In 2012, state officials who run Powerball and Mega Millions changed ticket prices and lowered the odds of winning jackpots in hopes the moves would increase the number of huge prizes and draw more players. 

The new rules worked, causing jackpots to repeatedly climb to record levels. More than half of the top 10 U.S. jackpots have been reached in the past couple of years.
