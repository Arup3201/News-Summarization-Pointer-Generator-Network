Britain’s beleaguered Passport Office will be taken over by the Government to avoid a repeat of this summer's travel chaos, it was announced today.

Home Secretary Theresa May announced the move in the wake of two damning reports into the agency's failings - after it allowed its application backlog to spiral out of control putting thousands of family holidays in jeopardy.

It also comes after the influential Home Affairs Select Committee urged the Government to strip the Passport Office of its independent status.

Pictures leaked to MailOnline, showing hundreds of boxes of applications piled on the floor of a Passport Office in Liverpool, piled pressure on the Government to introduce emergency measures to tackle the backlog

The Passport Office was accused of putting holidaymakers’ summer plans in jeopardy as it struggled to cope with demand and a backlog of applications in progress spiralled to 550,000.

Ministers said the number of outstanding applications has now fallen to around 80,000.

After the severity of the delays emerged, applicants booked to travel within seven days, whose applications had been with the Passport Office for longer than three weeks, were offered a free upgrade to the fast-track service.

The Home Affairs Select Committee has called for all applicants who paid for the fast-track upgrade, prior to the contingency measures being introduced, to be compensated.

A normal passport application costs £72.50, while the fast-track service costs £103.

The Passport Office was established as an executive agency of the Home Office on May 13 last year.

A similar move was made for the former UK Border Agency, which was abolished and brought back into the Home Office under control of ministers.

The Passport Office will be scrapped as an arms-length ‘executive agency’ from October 1 and current chief executive Paul Pugh has effectively been sacked.

He will remain in place until a successor - in the form of a Director General - is appointed.

Home Affairs Committee chairman Keith Vaz called on the Government to return the Passport Office under the control of the Government

The Home Secretary said: ‘On June 12, I informed the House that I had asked the permanent secretary to conduct a review to consider whether HMPO’s agency status should be removed.

‘I have considered the review and relevant Cabinet Office guidance and decided that it should be brought into the Home Office and report directly to ministers.

‘As the events of the summer showed, it is essential that HMPO is run as efficiently as possible and is as accountable as possible.

‘I also know that its hard-working staff are committed to delivering a high-quality service to the public.

‘I believe these changes will put them in a stronger position to do so.’
