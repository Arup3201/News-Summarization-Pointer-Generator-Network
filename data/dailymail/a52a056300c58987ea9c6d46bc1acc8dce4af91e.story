A 14-year-old Christian student was sent to his principal’s office and suspended for telling a classmate that being gay is wrong.

Dakota Ary, of Fort Worth, Texas, was overheard giving his opinion to a friend during a ninth-grade German class discussion.

The Western Hills High School student is a ‘very well-grounded’ teenager who volunteers at his church, his shocked mother said.

Opinion: Dakota Ary, 14, of Fort Worth, Texas, was sent to his principal's office and suspended for telling a classmate that being gay is wrong

A class discussion turned to religion and homosexuality in Germany when the Christian boy told a friend that ‘being a homosexual is wrong’.

‘It wasn’t directed to anyone except my friend who was sitting behind me,’ he told Fox News. ‘I guess (the teacher) heard me.’

Dakota said his teacher started ‘yelling’ and sent him to the principal’s office, where he was given two days of full suspension.

‘He’s been in church his whole life and he’s been taught to stand up for what he believes,’ Dakota’s furious mother Holly Pope told Fox News.

But when Ms Pope got her lawyer involved, the school decided against the suspension so he could play in a forthcoming football match.

‘They’ve righted all the wrongs,’ lawyer Matt Krause told Fox News. ‘This should have no lasting effect on his academic or personal record going forward.’

Mr Krause  said the principal is ‘doing the right thing’ but Dakota should never have been suspended as it breached his Constitutional rights.

Ms Pope added that her son was not disruptive, threatening or hostile - and he never suggested he had anything against gay people.

Dakota will return to the teacher’s classroom and has been told to respect him ‘what his beliefs are or what they are not’, she added.

A Fort Worth Independent School District spokesman told Fox News it does not comment on specific employee or student issues.

‘We are following district policy in our review of the circumstances and any resolution will likewise be in accordance with district policy,' he added.
