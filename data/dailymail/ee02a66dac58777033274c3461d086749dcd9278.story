The Football Association are poring over video footage of Branislav Ivanovic’s altercation with James McCarthy in Chelsea's win against Everton on Wednesday night.

The Chelsea defender appeared to aim a headbutt at McCarthy and then there were suggestions he tried to bite him.

The FA have already started investigating the entire melee involving players from both teams and are waiting on the report of referee Jon Moss and his match officials due this morning. Both teams could be charged for failing to control their players.

They are trying to establish exactly what went on before deciding on the appropriate course of action.

Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho refused to discuss the issue after the match and is sure to be furious if the FA take any action against his player.

Moss is not expected to include in his report that he saw what happened.

That would pave the way for the FA to take retrospective action and impose a three-match ban, which would rule Ivanovic out of the Capital One Cup final against Tottenham.

Mourinho feels his team are being victimised by match officials and the media, in the wake of Diego Costa being retrospectively banned for three matches for a stamp on Emre Can.

The Portuguese questioned why Robin Van Persie was not banned for appearing to aim an elbow at James Tomkins in Manchester United’s draw with West Ham.

Referee Marck Clattenburg saw that incident and opted to give Van Persie a talking to, leaving the FA powerless to take further action.

Martin Keown – I think he's just about going to get away with this, there's not enough in it in terms of making contact with his head. He'll get away with it for me.

Steve McManaman: I don’t think it was worth a red card, Jon Moss, the referee didn't see the incident - it's up to the law makers now.

Robbie Savage: I've seen a lot worse but can you grab someone around the throat and do that? If the referee sees the movement towards McCarthy it's a red for me.

Michael Owen: It’s a yellow for me - nothing more. 

Phil Neville: It's not clear cut enough for the FA to ban him for three games, for me. It’s not good what’s he done granted, but I don’t think the FA will take action.
