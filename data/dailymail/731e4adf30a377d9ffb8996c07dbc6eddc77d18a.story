In the space of one frantic fortnight, Jak Alnwick has been exposed to the brilliance and brutality of life as a professional footballer.

On Sunday afternoon, as the rookie goalkeeper makes his full home debut in a Tyne-Wear derby, you get the feeling his experience will swing across the perilous pendulum which divides those two extremes.

To recap, the 21-year-old was an unknown without a Wikipedia page two weeks ago when he emerged from the backbenches of the dugout at St James’ Park to first flatten Diego Costa and then perform heroics as Newcastle became the first team to beat Chelsea since April.

Then, at Arsenal, he shipped four on live television and suffered the humiliation of Santi Cazorla’s ‘Panenka’ penalty, a cheeky chip straight down the middle which does little for the confidence of any goalkeeper, let alone one making his first Premier League start.

And so to Spurs at the other end of the Seven Sisters Road where his fortunes fared even worse. Again, four were conceded, only this time he was at fault for two and picked up a shoulder injury.

He has been on the back pages of national newspapers for reasons which span good and bad. That, after all, is the existence of a professional footballer.

Today, however, represents an entirely different proposition. Eight goals at Arsenal and Spurs will be forgotten with the passage of time. Tyne-Wear derbies, however, are etched in North-East folklore for eternity – just ask Liam O’Brien, he scored a winning free-kick for Newcastle at Roker Park in 1992 and hasn’t had to buy a drink on Tyneside since.

Alnwick, then, would be forgiven for carrying a few nerves with him as he journeys along the River Tyne from his Prudhoe home and across the water to St James’.

Alan Pardew is well aware of the exposure and expectancy surrounding the young custodian, who has been passed fit following his shoulder scare.

‘I have certainly had a chat with him,’ admits the man who is bidding to avoid becoming the first Newcastle manager in derby history to suffer four straight defeats.

‘I would have done that if he hadn't made a mistake (at Spurs) because I think it's important to talk to young players when they are going into the first team.

‘I think he was unlucky with his mistake (dropped his catch from a corner and Spurs scored) because he got punished severely with it.

‘You can get away with that sometimes, and I have played with much better goalies than Jak, without being disrespectful to him, who have got away with it.

‘They have dropped it and someone has cleared it, or it was blocked on the line or something, so I explained that to him. I think he realised that.

‘He was apologetic about the mistake, as you would imagine, but I said to him it's important not to be too apologetic, that's it's gone.

‘We make mistakes in other areas and there are all forgotten; you make a mistake there and it isn't, so he grasped that.

‘He's a local boy, he wants to make amends today in terms of a real performance, and all my squad and my staff, because we like him, will be wishing that happens.’

Alnwick is out of contract in the summer and, with Tim Krul and Rob Elliot sidelined until the middle of January, he has a chance to win a new deal.

Either way, Pardew says the experience will serve the former Sunderland youth keeper well.

‘Whatever line his career takes, this is going to be a massive period for him,’ says the boss.

‘He did brilliantly against Chelsea, everyone was raving about him. Now he has had a down-turn against Spurs and now he has got the other side of the coin, all in the space of eight or nine days, and that is football.

‘In a minuscule way, he's had the experience of what it’s like to play football at the highest level, and now he needs to respond.’

Alnwick, of course, is one half of a goalkeeping family. His brother, Ben, played for Sunderland and Spurs and now resides between the posts for Peterborough.

He has every faith in his little brother and was thrilled – if a little panicked – when the call came that Jak was coming on at half-time against Chelsea.

‘I knew one of our local pubs had BT so I sprinted down and got there just in time to see Jak flatten Diego Costa with his first contribution,’ laughs the 27-year-old.

‘I was shaking just watching him play and all my Peterborough team-mates started texting me and this made me worse. But Jak was okay. Goalkeepers like a good first touch and Jak seemed to grow a couple of inches at the way he took care of Costa.’

Ben, then, is proud of his sibling, if a little envious at the same time.

‘On Sunday he will be doing something I have dreamed about all my life - playing in a derby match for Newcastle with Sunderland,’ he says.

‘I was actually on the bench for Sunderland at St James' Park in the derby match Newcastle won with that goal from Emre in 2005.

‘But like all Northumberland lads I would have loved to have played for Newcastle United. It's been my life-time dream. Now Jak is living my dream.’

Young Jak will certainly be hoping his first derby is more dream than nightmare.
