A British schoolboy was today feared to have drowned following a tragic swimming accident in ‘extremely dangerous’ seas off the west coast of France.

Kieran Knight, 16, was last seen desperately trying to swim back to the beach on an isolated stretch of coast close to the town of Messanges, in the Landes region, south of Bordeaux.

He was swimming with his father some 150 meters off from the shore in an unsupervised area where coastguards regularly pitch warning flags when he apparently ran into difficulties.

The teenager was last seen by a witness 
at around 3.30pm on Wednesday, sticking his arm in the air as his father
raised the alarm, but the schoolboy hasn't been found despite extensive searches.

The Foreign Office issued a statement on behalf of the 16-year-old's family.

It said: 'On Wednesday July 24, while holidaying with his family on the Atlantic coast in south-west France, Kieran Knight, aged 16, got caught by a strong undercurrent and was unable to make his way back to shore.

'Despite extensive ongoing searches by the French authorities, Kieran has not been located. Kieran's family would like to request privacy at this time to come to terms with this tragic event concerning their much-loved son.'

French officials had said earlier this week that rescue workers were alerted to the boy's disappearance near the town of Messanges, in the Landes region, on Wednesday afternoon.

‘The boy was seen disappearing under the waves,’ said a spokesman from the local coastguards.

‘He and his father had found themselves in difficulty quite a way out to sea, but the boy was unable to get back to the shore.

‘We immediately scrambled a patrol boat and three helicopters, but the boy has not been found. It is feared that he has drowned.’

The coastguards spokesman said that the stretch of coast was ‘extremely dangerous’ because of the fast currents and strong winds.

At the time of the accident the weather was good, and the swell was less than one meter high, but there was a ‘very strong’ tide, said the spokesman.

Kieran, a sibling, and his mother and father were on the first day of their summer holiday, having just checked into the Vieux-Port camp site close to Messanges.
