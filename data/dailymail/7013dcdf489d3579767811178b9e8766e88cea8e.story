As the wintry cold sets, one little boy has found himself the perfect snuggle buddy - a Shih Tzu by the name of Abba.

A home video captures two-year-old Silas from New York wearing a festive onesie as he watches cartoons with his fluffy friend.

The duo rest against each other peacefully, with their heads and shoulders touching.

At one point, Silas looks at his companion and lets out a 'meh' in a bid to talk to her.

'Are you going to give her a kiss?' a woman filming the sweet scene asks.

Silas looks longingly at Abba but goes back to the television after his advances are rebuffed.

To date the video has been watched more than 79,000 times.

Many viewers have deemed the duo 'cute' and 'adorable'.

Silas' mother says that he and Abba are becoming great friends and are very gentle with each other.
