Tesco has spent millions relaunching its Finest range after discovering shoppers were turning to Waitrose, Marks & Spencer and Sainsbury's for upmarket treats.

From hand-decorated cakes worthy of the Great British Bake Off to pies filled with the best ale and berries, the revamped range, which went on sale this month, is clearly aimed at wooing affluent customers.

But will it work? Or is Tesco inextricably linked in shoppers’ eyes with budget fare?

Daily Mail cook ANNE SHOOTER taste-tested the new Tesco products against similar high-end items from Sainsbury’s (which has a rival Taste The Difference range), Waitrose and M&S to find out which supermarket's food really is the finest.

Taste tester: Anne Shooter with a selection of supermarket foods

Fabulous: Waitrose Heston Chicken Liver Parfait

Tesco Finest Rannoch Smoked Duck Pate, 113g, £1.50

Oh dear, not a good start. This pate is very sweet and doesn’t taste of smoked duck at all - not surprising, as it is mostly made of duck liver and pork fat. Yuck. 1/5

Sainsbury’s Taste The Difference Duck Liver Pate with Grand Marnier, 170g, £2.15

A traditional pate that transports me to a French charcuterie - creamy with back- notes of orange from the Grand Marnier. The slightly spongy texture disappoints. 3/5

M&S Chicken Liver Pate, 170g, £1.49

Savoury and rich, with a lovely warmth that comes from the addition of Madeira. Doesn't look particularly appealing, but tastes utterly yummy. 4/5

Waitrose Heston Chicken Liver Parfait, 80g, £3.99

This is pricey but so pretty in its little jar - as well as being delicious. Push aside the buttery seal to reveal a silky pate with layers of flavour - savoury, sweet, creamy, with a warm cognac finish. Fabulous. 5/5

Winner: Waitrose

Tesco Finest Smoked Haddock Fishcakes, £3 for two

Moist and fluffy, with a lovely smoky flavour from the undyed haddock, and a good crumb. There’s a gooey, cheesey middle, too: unnecessary, but luxurious. 4/5

Sainsbury's Taste The Difference Smoked Haddock Fishcakes with Cheddar and Leek Centres, £2.99 for two

Comforting, but tastes like potato flavoured with leek and cheese - I can barely detect the fish. Tasty, though. 3/5

M&S Salmon, Cod and Smoked Haddock Melting Middle Fishcakes, £4 for two

Like a fish pie in a ball shape! The combination of fish flavours works well, but the salmon is dry and I'm sure I am detecting little pieces of undercooked onion. 3/5

Waitrose Cod Fishcakes with Cheddar and Lemon, £4.19 for two

These look impressive, but are disappointingly bland. They have lots of fish, but it doesn't taste of anything. The overwhelming flavour is lemon from the sauce. 2/5

Winner: Tesco

Tesco Finest Chorizo and Chipotle Chilli Quiche, 400g, £3.25

Is this a quiche? All I can taste is the chilli in the pastry (not nice) and the smoky chorizo on a thin eggy layer. It’s more like a pizza. 1/5

Sainsbury's Taste The Difference Goat’s Cheese & Spinach Quiche, 170g, £1.90

Very good. Large pieces of light, fresh goat’s cheese atop spinach-flecked custard in a buttery pastry. Looks pretty, too. 4/5

M&S Slow Roasted Tomato, Feta and Spinach Quiche, £2.29

This looks rather patchy and  tastes delicious - crisp, perfect pastry and sweet tomatoes that contrast well with the salty feta. 5/5

Waitrose Balsamic Onion and West Country Cheddar Tart, 400g, £3.49

A good traditional quiche with a twist - the balsamic onions give a sweetness that works well with the cheese. The pastry is too thick for the thin filling layer, though. 3/5

Winner: M&S

Sausage test: Waitrose is the winner when it comes to the best tasting sausages

Tesco Finest Pork and Caramelised Onion Sausages, £2.99 for six

A good proportion of pork - 74 per cent, but the onion makes them too sweet. Children will love them, but they are not savoury enough for me. 3/5

Sainsbury's Taste the Difference Caramelised Red Onion and Pork Sausages, £3 for six

The 77 per cent pork makes these a decent sausage, but they are also very sweet from the onions, and the addition of onion powder gives them an artificial flavour. Good herby notes, though. 3/5

M&S Gloucester Old Spot Sausages, £3.79 for six

These are like sausages your butcher would make. They have a whopping 90 per cent pork and no rusk or breadcrumbs, so they are uber-meaty. Very 'piggy' - amazing if you like that kind of thing. 4/5

Waitrose Pork Sausages with Caramelised Red Onion Confit, £3 for six

These are really meaty - 80 per cent pork - with just the right amount of caramelised onion flavour. A truly delicious sausage. 5/5

Winner: Waitrose

Tesco Finest Traditional Recipe Cherry Tomato and Chilli Pasta Sauce, 340g, £1.65

Not spicy enough for me and rather sweet, this is also slightly gloopy, probably from the addition of potato starch. 3/5

Sainsbury's Taste The Difference Cherry Tomato and Chilli Pasta Sauce, 330g, £1.65

Rich with a good flavour, this has a great chilli kick and a natural taste - but it is on the greasy side, with a film of oil on top. 4/5

M&S Arrabiata Pasta Sauce, 340g, £1.99

This has a lovely bright colour and is fresh-tasting with a big chilli hit. It tastes home-made and has no additives. Great stuff. 5/5

Waitrose Hot and Spicy Arrabiata, 555g, £2.49

I like the colour and fresh flavour of this, but it is lacking salt and - crucially - sugar, making it bland and too acidic. 3/5

Winner: M&S

Tesco Finest Slow-Cooked Scotch Beef and Cornish Ale Pie £3.20

This looks very cute, coming, as it does, in a little flower pot. It's only a shame the pot is plastic and the pie is horrid! The pastry is too soggy underneath and the gravy is gloopy and bitter with the meat disintegrated into it. Back to the drawing board. 1/5

Sainsbury's Taste The Difference Beef Steak Pie, £3

A well-filled pie with lots of pieces of meat in good gravy. The pastry is a little too thick, but it's tasty - made with lard as well as butter. 4/5

M&S Handcrafted Steak and Old Peculier Ale Pie, £3.49

Dangerously delicious - I dare you to try this pie and not finish it. Well-browned, soft meat chunks in a proper beery onion gravy within fantastic pastry. 5/5

Waitrose Dark and Velvety Aberdeen Angus Steak and Ale Top Crust Pie, £2.99

Not enough meat and too much gravy. The flavour of the sauce is good, but the pastry is greasy. Not a great offering. 2/5

Winner: M&S

Tesco Finest Red Velvet Cake, £10

Stunning looking cake with three layers of moist, chocolatey sponge and lots of divine cream-cheese frosting, finished with striking red crumbs. Superb. 5/5

Sainsbury's Red Velvet Cupcakes, £1.35 for two

Pretty, yet so disappointing. The sponge tastes as if it's full of additives - which it is - and the buttercream is sickly sweet. Did anyone taste these first? 0/5

Too sweet: Waitrose Seriously Fruity Passion Cake, left, but Tesco Finest Red Velvet Cake is superb

M&S Triple Chocolate Brownie Layer Cake, £4.99

A treat for chocolate lovers, made of layers of vanilla sponge, buttercream and brownies.  Tastes luxurious and rich. 4/5

Waitrose Seriously Fruity Passion Cake, £4.29

Like a carrot cake with added pineapple and coconut. I expect it to be moist, but it’s on the dry side and very sweet. The passion-fruit frosting is too sugary. 2/5

Winner: Tesco

Tesco Finest Morello Cherry Cheesecake, £4.40

Stylish with its red topping, this has a good cherry flavour that works well with the vanilla filling. But the cheesecake is too set. 4/5

Sainsbury's Frozen Taste The Difference New York Cheesecake, £3

A very creamy, silky topping on a great biscuit base. Just a point lost for its unimpressive looks. 4/5

M&S Lemon and Raspberry Brulee Cheesecake, £4

Love the crunchy topping, love the base, love the lemon and raspberry combo. But where's the creamy stuff in the middle? 3/5

Waitrose Frozen Chocolate Cheesecake, £3.79

Oh. My. Diet. Just. Died. Worth it, though, for this dreamy, creamy concoction that is like a divinely silky chocolate mousse on a biscuity base. Seconds, please. 5/5

Winner: Waitrose

Waitrose and M&S share the top prize, as each come top in three categories. Tesco is close behind with two - still well ahead of Sainsbury's, which doesn't manage to win a single category. Tesco Finest? It would appear not.
