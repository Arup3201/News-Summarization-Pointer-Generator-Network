Having been almost decapitated by discarded fishing nets, these seals are being released into the wild after medics nursed them back to health.

The heart-warming photographs show a four-month-old seal pup named Iron Man and a five-month-old called Beast let back in the water off Cornwall.

They were badly injured by lost, discarded or abandoned fishing nets that campaigners warn can cause a devastating impact to marine life.

In the two-month period following Christmas 2014, there were five seals entangled in such nets saved by marine rescuers in Cornwall alone.

Iron Man was rescued last December having suffered severe injuries after a 30ft-long piece of lost fishing trawl net became caught around his neck.

British Divers Marine Life Rescue found him near Pendeen, not far from Land’s End, entangled with a net and trapped on rocks near the shore.

With a drowning risk posed by an incoming tide, medics freed the net from the rocks and cut it from where it had created a deep wound round his head.

Sue Sayer from Cornwall Seal Group, who will monitor Iron Man’s progress back on the wild, said: ‘These cases are by no means unique.

Beast in recovery: The five-month-old was also rescued with a deep wound on his neck after a fishing net cut into his flesh

Coming to their aid: Staff from the Cornish Seal Sanctuary hospital in Gweek - near Culdrose Airfield - help the injured seals

Medical attention: This seal was helped by the Cornish Seal Sanctuary, set in the Helford Estuary, which is a national rescue centre

Nursing them back to health: Lost, discarded or abandoned fishing nets are known as 'ghost gear' - and can cause serious harm to seals

‘Iron Man would have playfully explored the lost fishing net floating in the sea and then become hideously wrapped up in it.

‘Despite being only a few months old, he had been entangled long enough to cause a wound so deep it looked like his head was being cut off.’

After his rescue, Iron Man was immediately transported to the Cornish Seal Sanctuary hospital in Gweek for emergency veterinary treatment.

He is now four months old and was released in full health back into the ocean last Thursday, where it is hoped he will thrive in his natural habitat.

He was accompanied by Beast, who was also rescued with a deep wound on his neck after a fishing net cut into his flesh.
