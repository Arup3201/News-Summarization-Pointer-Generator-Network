FA Cup minnows Warrington Town got a pep talk from their most famous former player - 1966 World Cup winner Roger Hunt - as they received a plum home draw against League Two Exeter City in Monday night's first round draw.

Hunt, who played for the club between 1955 and 1958 before signing for Liverpool, turned up at Warrington's Cantilever Park ground to watch the draw with the current players who have made history by reaching the first round for the first time in their 65-year history.

Warrington, who play in the eighth tier of English football, are managed by Shaun Reid, brother of former Everton and England star Peter.

Hunt played for the club when they were known as Stockton Heath - they changed their name in 1961 to reflect the whole of the town.

Now 76, he said: 'Although I went on to win things with Liverpool under Bill Shankly and England, I've never forgotten where it all started for me.

'I am so proud to see them in the FA Cup first round, we didn't manage it when I played for them! There was a great atmosphere when the draw was made and I've told the lads they've got to go out and enjoy it. There is nothing to be afraid of.'

Hunt still lives in Warrington and has been known to turn up on occasions to watch their games.
