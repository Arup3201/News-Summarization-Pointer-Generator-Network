Two wanna-be rappers have been arrested after extorting $50,000 plus almost $4,000 worth of Apple products out of the son of a prominent New York banker.

John Fontein, 27, an amateur record producer and son of Goldman Sachs broker Andrew Fontein, had initially agreed to pay Ryan Mixon and Andres Lozano the hefty sum to cut a record.

However, on Thursday night, during a meeting at restaurant Pera Soho in Greenwich Village, Mr Fontein tried to back out of the deal.

But Mixon, 33, and Lozano, 28, were not about to let their dreams of hip hop stardom fade that fast.

The pair demanded the record producer pay up. If he didn't, they said they'd kill his family and do 'unspeakable things' to his girlfriend, according to The New York Post.

The rappers also marched him at gunpoint to the Apple Store on Fifth Avenue and East 59th St in Manhattan.

There, they forced him to buy $3,800 worth of gadgets, including iPads and laptops, before finally letting him go.

The next morning, Mr Fontein went to the the NYPD's First Precinct near his Park Pl. home and recounted the extortion plot to detectives.

While the man was talking to the police, one of the rappers sent him a text to line up a 'drop time' for the $50,000, according to The Post.

Mr Fontein did so, but when Mixon and Lozano arrived at the agreed place, the scene of the previous night's meeting, officers were ready.

'It was like a business deal gone bad,' a police source told The Post.

The men were both arrested and charged with kidnapping, robbery and extortion, among other things.
