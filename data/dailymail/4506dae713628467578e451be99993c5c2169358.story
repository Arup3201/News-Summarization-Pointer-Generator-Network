At least Lukas Podolski was able to find the humour in Arsenal's disappointing display against Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday, albeit with a light-hearted joke about his missing shinpad.

The Gunners forward's tactical deployment from the bench for Mikel Arteta after 77 minutes in their 2-0 Champions League Group D opening loss was delayed when Podolski couldn't complete his required playing kit.

After rummaging around the dugout, the Germany international had to borrow from his countryman Mesut Ozil, who had been brought off in a double substitution with Aaron Ramsey 15 minutes prior.

The substitution - and the shin pads - didn't do Arsene Wenger's side any good though as they were unable to recover from 2-0 down in their opening Champions League group match.

Clearly not beaten up by the result, Podolski had a joke at his own expense on Instagram on Wednesday.

'After last night I’m thinking about bringing out my own set of books,' he wrote with a mock image of a Where's Wally book with his own image and the title, Where's My Shin-pad?
