Lib Dem member Natasha Chapman described how she was groped and leered at by older men

Fresh sex harassment claims against senior Lib Dems emerged last night.

Both male and female members told a meeting they were pestered or groped by party figures, while others claimed there remained a ‘cultural problem’ with sexism. 

One female activist described how older men would often hug her, but then put their hands on her lower back before letting them ‘slip’ to her bottom.

Others felt they just ‘had to put up with’ abuse and claimed their concerns were still not being taken seriously, despite Nick Clegg vowing to tackle the problem following disputed allegations involving Lib Dem peer Lord Rennard.

Activists said the police probe into the former chief executive was being used as an ‘excuse’ to sweep other sexual harassment claims under the carpet.

The latest revelations came yesterday at a fringe event at the Lib Dem conference in Glasgow.

Natasha Chapman, a 22-year-old student from Lincoln, described how she was groped and leered at by older men at regional conferences and other events.

She said: ‘A few times people’s hands are on your lower back and then you feel the slip. 

‘You feel annoyed, but then you do not want to start an argument on the spot. It’s not really very pleasant and it does destroy your confidence.’

She declined to identify the culprits, but claimed the attacks were not made by MPs because they had ‘too much to lose’.

‘It does make me wonder though how many good women candidates we have lost out on since the Rennard claims,’ she added after the meeting.

A male Lib Dem councillor – who did not give his name – said he had been sexually harassed by a woman councillor but was told not to risk a by-election by complaining.

‘It wasn’t politically convenient’ to get rid of the councillor, he said. Yesterday’s meeting, organised by a protest group against harassment within the party called Rock the Boat, was not attended by a single senior Lib Dem. 

Founder James Shaddock said many were using the police probe into Lord Rennard as ‘an excuse to avoid the issue’.

Chris White, a councillor in St Albans, Hertfordshire, told the group there was a ‘cultural problem’ in the party.

He described how a female councillor said women who dress provocatively ‘are asking for it’ and claimed that older people in the party tolerated sexual harassment because they felt they ‘had to put up with it’.

‘Older people feel if you are robust this problem will go away, he said. 

‘That is not an attitude that is acceptable at all. We have to have zero tolerance.’

A Lib Dem spokesman acknowledged there were ‘failings in the past’ which led to an independent inquiry into the party’s culture and practices.

Party leader Nick Clegg later said he had ‘no idea’ why there were no senior figures at the event in Glasgow.

‘We have always taken issues like that very seriously and we will continue to do so,’ he said.
