Former federal parliamentary speaker Peter Slipper has won his appeal against three convictions for dishonestly misusing taxpayer-funded taxi vouchers.

ACT Supreme Court Judge Justice John Burns threw out the guilty charges and ordered the penalties given to Mr Slipper be set aside, in a court hearing Thursday morning.

Mr Slipper had been convicted in September 2014, ordering him to serve 300 hours community service and repay $954 to the Commonwealth.

Former federal parliamentary speaker Peter Slipper has won his appeal against three convictions for dishonestly misusing taxpayer-funded taxi vouchers.

Mr Slipper was found guilty last year of three dishonesty charges for misusing his government Cabcharge allowance  to visit Canberra wineries throughout 2010. He also filled out multiple vouchers in an attempt to hide the trips.

While he admitted to using government travel entitlements to visit vineyards outside Canberra in 2010, Mr Slipper always denied he acted dishonestly.

A Canberra court threw out the conviction against Mr Slipper, which was handed down in 2014.

The former speaker admitted to using the Cabcharge vouchers, but has always denied he acted dishonestly. 

Mr Slipper's lawyers told the court the original magistrate who found him guilty failed to consider other possibilities, including that he had simply made a mistake. 

His lawyers also said it had not been proven that Mr Slipper was not on parliamentary business.

Mr Slipper lodged his appeal in December, and had argued he should have simply been allowed to repay the money.

The former speaker was forced to resign from the position in 2012, after former staffer James Ashby brought sexual harassment claims against him.  

Mr Ashby recently abandoned his claim against Mr Slipper after a two-year court battle. He had alleged Mr Slipper sexual harassed him over a period of months, when he worked as a media adviser in the then-Speaker's office.
