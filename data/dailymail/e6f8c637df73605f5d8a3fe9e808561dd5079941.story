No compensation: Barry George was acquitted of murder

The man sensationally acquitted of 
murdering Jill Dando yesterday lost his High Court bid for compensation –
 on the grounds that another jury could have found him guilty.

Two judges ruled Barry George, who 
spent eight years in jail before being cleared of the TV presenter’s 
killing at a retrial, was not eligible for up to £500,000 as a victim of
 a ‘miscarriage of justice’.

Lawyers for the convicted sex 
offender claimed that the Justice Secretary  had unfairly and unlawfully
 decided  Mr George, 52, was ‘not innocent enough to be compensated’.

But in ruling that Mr George had 
‘failed the legal test’ for an award, Lord Justice Beatson and Mr 
Justice Irwin said the minister who had opposed his compensation bid was
 ‘entirely justified in the conclusion he reached’.

They added: ‘There was indeed a case 
upon which a reasonable jury, properly directed, could have convicted 
the claimant of murder.’

Crimewatch presenter Miss Dando, 37, was shot outside her home in Fulham, south-west London in April 1999.

The murder prompted an enormous 
inquiry by Scotland Yard and resulted in unemployed loner Mr George 
being convicted in July 2001.

He was granted a retrial on appeal, and received a unanimous acquittal by a jury in August 2008.

Mr George then made a  claim for 
compensation for lost earnings and wrongful imprisonment, but this was 
rejected in January 2010.

He went to court again to seek a 
reconsideration of his case, which could have opened the way for him to 
claim as much as £500,000.

His barrister, Ian Glen  QC, insisted
 that the original decision to refuse compensation was ‘defective and 
contrary to natural justice’, arguing that for more than 30 years, those
 acquitted on retrials in similar circumstances had been compensated.

Previously, compensation was only awarded for a miscarriage of justice if a claimant could effectively prove they were innocent.

But a Supreme Court hearing in 2011 
widened this to say a person is eligible for compensation if they can 
prove that no set of circumstances could possibly lead to their 
conviction by a jury.

The judges ruled Mr George’s case did
 not pass this second test. His solicitor, Nick Baird, said: ‘We are 
very disappointed with the judgment and shall be applying for permission
 to leapfrog the Court of Appeal to have the matter heard before the 
Supreme Court.’

Mr George’s action was one of five test cases to decide who is now entitled to payments in ‘miscarriage of justice’ cases.

Decisions to refuse payouts in all 
five cases were defended by current Justice Secretary Chris Grayling in a
 three-day hearing last October.

Only one claimant, Ian Lawless, who 
spent eight years in jail for murder before being freed by the Court of 
Appeal in 2009, was successful. The judges ruled the decision to refuse 
compensation was flawed and must be reconsidered.

Mr George – who has a record for 
attempted rape and indecent assault – and the three other claimants 
failed in their challenges. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ‘We 
welcome the Court’s decision in these cases, in that it confirms that 
our decision not to grant compensation to the named individuals was 
correct.’

In 2010, the Mail revealed how former
 deputy headmaster Sion Jenkins had been refused compensation for the 
six years he spent in  jail accused of murdering foster daughter 
Billie-Jo. He had sought up to £500,000 damages for the term he served 
before he was acquitted.

But although Mr Jenkins said he 
fitted ‘all the criteria’ for a payout, the Ministry of Justice rejected
 his request after officials assessed the case. Rules stated that 
applicants for miscarriage of justice compensation had to show they were
 ‘clearly innocent’ to receive money.
