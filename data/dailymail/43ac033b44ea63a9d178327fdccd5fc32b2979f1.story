Like any kitten, Ralphee is affectionate, playful and mischievous.

But it doesn’t take long to spot that she is different from other cats and is unsteady on her feet because of an unusual neurological condition which is colloquially known as ‘wobbly cat syndrome’.

The tabby can be seen waggling her head and sometimes jumping around uncontrollably, but is happy in the company of a protective cattle dog called Max.

The disorder is caused when a pregnant cat contracts feline distemper – a highly contagious and potential fatal vial disease.

It can result in cerebellum damage to unborn kittens as the virus passes from the mother cat to foetuses in her womb.

The earlier the mother cat contracts the disease in her pregnancy, the less likely the kittens are to survive – or the more serious their Feline CH will be.

Nature’s natural enemies immediately became friends when Ralphee was rescued from a barn at a horse stable and came to live with the dog in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.

The kitten has a neurological disorder called feline cerebellar hypoplasia (CH), which causes her to walk in an unusual way and wobble her head.

Some kittens are born with CH when their cerebellum – the part of the brain that controls coordination and fine motor skills – is underdeveloped.

The disorder develops inside the womb when a pregnant mother cat contracts feline distemper, which is a highly contagious and sometimes fatal viral disease.

Symptoms of the feline CH include: falling over for no apparent reason, a prancing, or high stepping walk and a general lack of balance, which can make it difficult for them to climb stairs.

Kitten's best friend: Ralphee has a neurological disorder called feline cerebellar hypoplasia (CH), which causes her to walk in an unusual way and wobble her head, but Max the dog watches over her

While Ralphee’s owner says she is happy, loves affection and causes trouble wherever she goes, Max the dog is protective over his feline friend.

‘Ever since Ralphee was brought home, Max is never far away. He appears to be forever curious and watches over Ralphee wherever she goes,’ according to the Wakaleo YouTube channel.

‘Ralphee is growing more mischievous by the day and loves to see what Max is doing as well. She will often get excited when he is nearby and leap in the air before playfully charging in his direction.’

Symptoms of the disorder include: falling over for no apparent reason, a prancing, or high stepping walk and a general lack of balance, which can make it difficult for cats like Ralphee (pictured) to climb stairs. Cats with the syndrome usually form close bonds with humans and animal companions like Max (also pictured)

While some people might be worried that animals with the condition are in pain - because they can appear to be walking gingerly and jerk around – they are not and their life expectancy is the same as an average cat’s, according to the CH Cat Community.

The cats also have normal levels of intelligence, although they are often more dependent on humans and other animals, like Max, with whom they build strong bonds.

The condition is non-progressive and some owners of cats with CH have said it appears to improve as they get older, because the cats learn to deal with symptoms over time.

The photographer who filmed Ralphee told MailOnline that she does everything a normal cat does with a few minor differences.

'She has a room that has blankets and anything pointy or hard softened with pillows so when she stumbles out of her bed she is surrounded by soft items to keep her safe. This is more a precaution than anything.'

Mealtimes can be messy but the kitten manages better if her food is elevated. She is allowed to play outside if she is supervised by Max.

'There is a definite connection between Max and Ralphee. Max seems bothered when Ralphee wanders too far and will often remain at her side wherever she goes.

'I think he may be aware that Ralphee is different as he seems to look much like a concerned father observing his kids as they play in the pool. It's quite surreal.

'Ralphee, will sometimes chase Max and give him a playful swipe and play tough before giving him a nuzzle or rubbing along his legs. Max seems happy to entertain this behaviour,' he said.

While the kitten loves to pounce on leaves and enjoys chasing nuts around, her favourite playmate is Max, who doesn't seem to tire of her antics.

'People often feel sorry for cats with disabilities but for Ralphee and many others they seem to get along without even realising they are any different,' he said.
