Dwarfing houses and trees, these enormous bonfire stacks have completely reshaped Belfast's skyline.

The huge tyre mounds, many of which are more than 100ft tall, have been built as the city nervously prepares for an annual  Protestant loyalist celebration.

Hundreds of fires will be set alight at midnight tonight as Protestant loyalists commemorate the Battle of the Boyne.

The annual demonstration sees 
thousands of Orange Order members and bandsmen go on parade across 
Northern Ireland - which has sparked serious rioting and violence in recent years between loyalists and nationalists.

A total of 550 parades are due to take place throughout Northern Ireland on Friday with 43 deemed to be contentious, resulting in hundreds of extra police officers been drafted on to the streets.

In recent years police 
officers have been battered with bricks, bottles and petrol bombs. Last year shots were also fired and a pipe bomb hurled at police lines in the Ardoyne.

The celebration marks the defeat of the Catholic King James, by the Protestant William of Orange in 1690, which was one of the major turning points in Irish history.

Taking place in1690, and known as the Battle of the Boyne, around
 36,000 troops commanded by King William III defeated an army of 
approximately 25,000 troops led by King James II along the river Boyne 
near the town of Drogheda.

The victory of Protestant William over
 the forces of England's Catholic king created a Protestant ascendancy 
in the Emerald Isle - most notably in the Ulster region.

The battle took place on 1 July in the Julian calendar, which is equivalent to 11 July in the Gregorian calendar, and the celebration is held each year on the 12th.

In 
Northern Ireland, the Eleventh Night refers to the night before the 
Twelfth of July, the annual Protestant commemoration of the famous 
battle.

On this night, large towering bonfires are lit - with 
Irish flags placed on top - in many Protestant, unionist and loyalist 
communities where it is also known as 'bonfire night'.

Sometimes stacked by their thousands, the tyres in such bonfires around 
the region cast a plume of fire - and thick, toxic smoke caused by the 
burning rubber - high into the night sky.

The PSNI chief constable has revealed he is drafting in an extra 630 police officers from forces across the UK to help keep the peace on the streets over the Twelfth.

Mr Baggott denied claims that the unprecedented move was an indication he was concerned about serious disorder in places like Ardoyne but said the scale of this year's Twelfth event was unique. 

The 30 units of specially trained additional public order officers will be used as a 'strategic reserve' and will be deployed to less sensitive areas accompanied by an armed PSNI officer.

Unionist anger has intensified in recent days over a decision to ban an Orange Order parade past a sectarian flash point.

While Orangemen will march past the 
Ardoyne shops on the Crumlin Road on Friday morning on their way to the 
annual Twelfth demonstration, the Parades Commission adjudication body 
has banned them from taking the same route on their return journey in 
the afternoon.

The interface area has been the scene of serious rioting on the Twelfth in recent years.

The Orange Order has branded the commission's decision "ludicrous" but urged supporters not to react with violence.

However, the hardline collective has 
been widely blamed for orchestrating violence which has seen police 
battered with bricks, bottles and petrol bombs during violent clashes.

Shots were also fired and a pipe bomb hurled at police lines in Ardoyne last year.

The decision by the Commission is the
 first time it has ruled that the Orange Order cannot hold an evening 
parade past Ardoyne. It came after intensive talks with nationalist 
residents failed to reach agreement.

With many communities building the huge tyre stacks, not everything has gone to plan.

A 40ft stack of tyres collapsed on an estate 10 miles outside the city on Tuesday.

The
 structure, comprising more than 25 layers of tyres and pallets, came 
tumbling to the ground under its own weight, according to website UTV, 
in Ballycraigy, Antrim,

It is illegal to burn 
the tyres, which emit toxic fumes - and bonfire committee workers had 
previously removed stacks in the area on safety grounds.

Their 
concerns are echoed by the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service 
(NIFRS), which advises those building and attending the bonfires to 
consider the risks.

'If we are called out to attend a 
bonfire-related incident, I am asking the community for their support to
 ensure that firefighters are able to carry out their job without fear 
of attack or harassment,' Assistant Chief Fire Officer Dale Ashford 
said.

Last year, there was a significant drop in the number of 
bonfire-related incidents - down from 49 call-outs between 6pm on July 
11 and 8am on July 12 in 2011, to 29 during the same period in 2012.
