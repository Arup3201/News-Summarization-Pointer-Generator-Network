Hugo Lloris has revealed how the France players used footballs as missiles in an attempt to knock down the spy drone that flew over their training ground last week.

The France team have become embroiled in a spying row after reporting that their training had been interrupted by a small, unmanned aircraft that was presumably armed with a camera.

Speaking after the French opened their World Cup campaign with an impressive 3-0 win against an over-physical Honduras, their captain spoke of an extraordinary incident that brought one of their training sessions to a halt.

Missiles: The drone flew over their training ground during a session last week

Over the top: A drone with a spy camera attached (not one which flew above France's training ground)

‘It’s a good invention,’ said Lloris  
with a smile. ‘It looked like a little helicopter and it flew well. We 
heard it first and then we saw it. We didn’t see anyone controlling. 
Maybe they were behind the stand or the hotel. It was a big challenge to
 hit it.’

On Saturday the 
France coach Didier Deschamps said the matter — which he described as an
 invasion of their privacy — was now being investigated by FIFA.

Curiously, a FIFA spokesperson has said they have not received an 
official complaint from the French federation. In the same Deschamps 
press conference a Honduran journalist insisted his country was not 
responsible for the drone. ‘No?’ said Deschamps with more than a hint of
 suspicion.

If Honduras were responsible, it did not do them much good here in Porto Alegre.

A ROOM WITH A VIEW

KINDERGARTEN FLOP

Napoli staff tried to blend in at a children’s judo practice next to a Juventus training session.

Was Lloris concerned on privacy grounds?

‘Players
 can do nothing about that,’ he said with a shrug. ‘Maybe the guy is 
from the hotel just behind the stand and you can’t see him. Maybe with a
 good job of the security we can find him!’

If
 Karim Benzema was among those who launched a football at the drone, he 
proved more accurate against Honduras. This World Cup has so far seen 
the big-name forwards make an early impact and Benzema was no exception —
 the Real Madrid striker scoring twice on his World Cup debut.

‘He
 had a really good season with Real Madrid, winning the Champions League
 final,’ said Lloris. ‘That has given him good confidence. He played 
well during the preparation games and he was in excellent condition to 
play.

‘He showed that. It was important for him to start well because he is a decisive player for France.

‘Maybe he is our key player and he showed it. This competition is the perfect platform to show who he is to everyone.’

Lloris
 said the France players should be more than happy with their 
performance against physically aggressive opponents who were reduced to 
10 men before half time with the dismissal of Wilson Palacios.

‘It’s
 a good start,’ said Lloris. ‘We expected that kind of game and we had 
good control. It was a tough game physically because Honduras play very 
hard, very strong. But we stayed very calm and played our own game.

‘We
 have to stay calm because it’s just the first game. We have two more 
strong games against  Switzerland and Ecuador. I think the next game 
will be decisive for us.

‘I 
don’t want to compare to four years ago but, for me and everyone, it was
 really important to start well this time and come into the competition 
with a good performance and a good result.’

Seeing red: Wilson Palacios was sent off just before half time after a second bookable offence for flooring Paul Pogba in the area

Lucky: But the Juventus midfielder could perhaps consider himself fortunate for not being sent off himself for an incident with the same player earlier
