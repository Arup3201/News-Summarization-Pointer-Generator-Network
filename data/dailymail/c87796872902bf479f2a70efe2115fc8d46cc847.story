TV reporters are often the target of videobombers who are desperate to get themselves seen on screen.

But one correspondent was so fed up with people videobombing her news reports that she has taken revenge by shaming them online.

Addie Olson, who covers Iowa on ABC 5 News was repeatedly interrupted by cyclists taking part in the state's annual seven day bike ride.

The news reporter then decided to make a compilation of all the clips of people who attempted to videobomb her and posted them to her Instagram account

So to get her own back she assembled clips of all the people who spoiled her reports and posted them to Instagram in a bid to shame the people attempting to videobomb her.

Miss Olson, who has been a reporter at the station since January 2013, was covering the The Registerâ€™s Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa.

But she was repeatedly stopped by people wanting to make sure they got their faces on camera too.

Not only did she have to deal with people sneaking up behind her, she also had people shouting and whooping in the background while she gives her piece to camera

The first clip shows a cyclist unzip his top and flash his chest in the background in a bid to disrupt her report.

Another cyclist then attempts to get close to her so he can stick his hand in her face, to which she shouts: 'Did you photobomb me?'

She then has to deal with people whooping and cheering as while she tries to talk.

In another clip as she speaks to the camera, a man in a passing car can be heard shouting: 'Travis it's that girl from the TV station!'

While in the fourth clip as she speaks to the camera, a man in a passing car can be heard shouting: 'Travis it's that girl from the TV station!'

She posted the compilation to her Instagram page saying: 'My entire week has been like this. At least Travis is a fan? #RAGBRAI #photobomb #MMJ #reporterprobs'
