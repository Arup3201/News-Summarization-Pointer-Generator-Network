Convicted rapist Ched Evans should not play football again until at least 2017, according to West Ham's Chief Executive Karren Brady. 

Evans was jailed in April 2012 after being found guilty of raping a woman, but was released in October last year after serving half of a five-year sentence. 

He will 'have to wait a long time before he returns to football, if at all,' Brady wrote in her Sun diary, 'That's as it should be. At least to 2017 when he has served his full parole.' 

Ched Evans, 26, has struggled to find a new club following his release from prison in October last year

The former Sheffield United and Wales striker has been trying to resume his playing career since his release from prison, but has faced a backlash from wider society, with several campaigns launched against him returning to the pitch.

Evans' supporters, however, feel that the striker has served his time and should be given the chance to complete his rehabilitation and continue his career. 

League One side Oldham Athletic had looked set to offer Evans a route back into football and held talks with the player, but the move collapsed amid external pressure from fans and sponsors, who threatened to pull their funding if Evans was signed.

Before the deal fell through, Oldham's motives were unclear and Brady has mused, 'The employment of another striker, Lee Hughes, soon after release for causing death by dangerous driving suggests they see the club as a rehabilitation unit - or is Evans just a cheap item unexpectedly on the market?'

Evans has maintained his innocence throughout the protests against him and is currently appealing against his conviction.
