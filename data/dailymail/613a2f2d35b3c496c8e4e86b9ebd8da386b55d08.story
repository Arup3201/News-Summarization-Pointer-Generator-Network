Walking down the aisle without her brother in the church was never going to be easy for Claire Holmes.

Russell was just 26 when he was killed by a brain haemorrhage four years ago, and the family is still grieving.

But among the congregation, one teenaged girl went some way to filling the gap in the family.

Abi Richardson, 18, was facing death in 
2008 - until Russell's family made 
the painful decision to donate his organs.

With a second chance at life, she struck up an unusual and touching relationship with the family of her life-saver.

And four years later, she was the first person Claire asked to be a bridesmaid at her wedding.

It was poignant moment for Russell's mother, Pauline, to see Abi and Claire together - but one that brought her great comfort.

Mrs Holmes, 60, who lives in Southampton, said: ‘It was a lovely wedding day. We all missed Russell so much, but having Abi there as bridesmaid, it was almost as though he was here with us, which made me feel better.’

Their remarkable friendship began in 2009, 12 months after Abi had anonymously received Russell’s liver for her lifesaving transplant.

Tragic: Russell Holmes was 26 when he died of a brain haemorrhage carrying furniture in 2008

Although her son did not have a donor card, Mrs Holmes decided to give Russell's organs up for transplant after his death in October 2008.

Russell, 26, had been helping some friends move furniture when he collapsed and was rushed to Southampton General Hospital.

Mrs Holmes, who works for an administrator for a yacht broker, said: ‘It was devastating. When we arrived at the hospital the doctors told us that he’d suffered this massive brain haemorrhage and there was nothing that could be done for him.

‘I couldn’t take it in. I thought he must be talking about someone else. Russell was only 26 years old, and he had his whole life ahead of him.

‘Now he was lying in a hospital bed with only a machine keeping him alive.’

The doctors asked Mrs Holmes and her ex-husband Trevor, whether they would agree to Russell’s organs being donated for transplant.

She said: ‘It was a lot to take in. But then I thought of a friend’s daughter who needed a heart and lung transplant. Russell didn’t have a donor card, but we knew that he would want to help others. We couldn’t waste his life, so we agreed.’

His liver and kidneys were used for donation. Part of his liver went to Abi, another part of it went to another man, one of his kidneys went to a man and another kidney went to a woman.

Mrs Holmes said: ‘I didn’t know any of the recipients, but I bought them each a good luck card and asked the hospital to pass them on. I didn’t expect to hear back from any of them. I just hoped that he had managed to help save another four lives.’

Then three months later, she received a letter through the post from Miss Richardson.

Mrs Holmes said: ‘It was a lovely letter. She said she was sorry for the loss of my son, but that thanks to him she had another chance at life. She also said that she would like to meet me. Her mum Sarah also wrote to me explaining that Abi had been born with chronic liver disease and had been waiting two years for a transplant.

‘My heart filled with joy. Of course I’d rather still have my son with me, but it felt wonderful knowing that this young girl had a chance at a future because of Russell.’

More letters were sent between them and then a few weeks later, Abi’s mother telephoned Mrs Holmes, and they agreed to meet up in December 2009 at a hotel in Lyme Regis.

Transplant: Abi was born with liver disease and faced death aged 13 sitting on a stagnant transplant list

Friendship: She sent a letter, aged 13, to grieving mother Pauline to thank her for a second chance at life

Mrs Holmes said: ‘I didn’t know how I was going to react when I met Abi for the first time, but when I saw her I was so glad that we had agreed to meet.

‘She was beautiful and had blue eyes, just like Russell. I had been worried that I’d find it unsettling, but instead I found it comforting.

‘Abi put her arms around me and thanked me for everything we had done and we all started to cry. It was so emotional. Even though we were strangers, there was this bond between us.’

Since then, their relationship has gone from strength to strength. They speak on the phone every few days - and in May, Abi was asked to be Claire’s bridesmaid.

Mrs Holmes said: ‘I’ve come to love Abi as a daughter, so it felt so right having her as Claire’s bridesmaid on her wedding day. She stayed at our house the night before the wedding, and it all felt so right.

Like family: Pauline said having Abi there was like having Russell there in spirit at Claire's wedding day this year

‘It was wonderful to see her standing next to Claire, in her beautiful turquoise dress.

‘Abi’s parents have also asked me to be godmother to their youngest daughter Lily Mai, which is a huge honour.

‘I can’t have my son back but he has given priceless gifts. Abi has gone from a terribly ill girl to a young woman who celebrated her 18th birthday in October.

‘Losing Russell was the hardest thing in the world and I will never get over it, but knowing that my son has given other people a second chance at life makes it that little bit easier.

More than 10,000 people in the UK currently need a transplant. Of these, 1000 each year - that’s three people each day - will die.
