Steve Job's widow spoke out for the first time about her husband's death and his lasting legacy that inspires her to fulfill her passions.

Laurene Powell Jobs spoke about how her famous husband Steve left both a personal and a private legacy, only one of which she feels comfortable talking about now that he is dead.

'In the public (legacy) we see the products that he created, that he cared so deeply about that changed all of our lives- the way that we function and communicate,' she said in an interview with NBC's Brian Williams on Rock Center that aired Friday night.

Life after love: Laurene Powell Jobs talked about how her husband Steve left a private and public legacy

Tender moment: Though he was known best as the Apple CEO, Laurene said that she and their children miss Steve as a loving father and husband (seen together in 2011)

What he wanted to do in his life was create tools that allow people to work at the highest level, and I think he did that. So that legacy is beautiful for me to live with.'

Mrs Powell Jobs, who continues her husband's tradition of being notoriously private, agreed to be interviewed because she is working with a documentary filmmaker to promote immigration reform.

As part of the preconditions for the interview, she made it clear that she would not talk about her famous husband's death.

That said, she did pay a small tribute to her husband of 20 years by praising him as a father and partner.

Lips sealed: Mrs Powell Jobs only spoke briefly about her husband, saying that seeing Apple products around the world is a positive reminder of his great work

'His private legacy with me and the kids is that of husband and father, and we miss him every day,' she said.

Jobs was known for his intense work ethic, and even he admitted that part of the reason why he allowed a biographer to interview him repeatedly before his death was so that his children could get a full portrait of the work he did while away from his family.

In addition to the more than 650-page tome, Mrs Powell Jobs told how the myriad of Apple products that he created also serve as living memorials.

Passion project: Mrs Powell Jobs teamed up with filmmaker Davis Guggenheim to created a documentary about the struggles of undocumented immigrants

'Having the body of work surrounding us is actually a really beautiful reminder and I find it touching and inspiring for me to make sure that I continue to do what I'm most passionate about and I hope my kids feel the same way,' she said.

That passion has driven her to work with Academy Award-winning director Davis Guggenheim to create and promote the film ‘The Dream is Now’ which unveils the plight of students raised in the United States who are pushed out of the country because they are undocumented immigrants.
