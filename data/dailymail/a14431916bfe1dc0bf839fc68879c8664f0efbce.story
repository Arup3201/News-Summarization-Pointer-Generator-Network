Normally she's not afraid to  flaunt about in a bikini and show off her flesh, but this time Pamela Anderson showcases a more demure look.   

The 47-year-old looked unrecognisable as she posed for the Autumn cover issue of Notofu magazine.

With her trademark blonde locks styled into a shapely bob and held together with a velvet bow, it is hard to believe this is the same woman.

Make-under: Pamela Anderson showcases a more demure look for the cover of Notofu magazine

The Peter Pan collar adds to the sophisticated and very different attire for the model and actress. 

Natural make up accentuates Pamela's piercing blue eyes and shapely cheekbones as she poses sweetly in front of the cameras, but notably her wedding ring is still missing. 

It comes after she was seen out and about wearing the ring suggesting that things with husband Rick Salomon are definitely back on.

In July, just weeks after marrying Salomon for a second time, Pamela filed for divorce but the blonde bombshell has now filed a petition asking a judge to toss out the divorce filing.

Pamela filed the dismissal request on August 21, according to People magazine, just weeks after the pair enjoyed a cosy holiday in Copenhagen, Denmark. 

Apparently Pamela was only trying to force the wayward Salomon to tow the line when she hit him with divorce papers.

Change of heart: Pamela Anderson has apparently filed a petition requesting the court to dismiss her July divorce filing against husband Rick Salomon (pictured with her on May 16 in Cannes, France)

'Pam felt the only thing she could do at this point in her relationship and marriage to Rick was to file for divorce because of his wild partying,' an insider claimed.

'They love each other, but it's always a roller coaster with Pam and Rick. No one should be shocked if they reconcile. Since she filed for divorce, Rick has been begging Pam to halt the proceedings.' 

Pamela, who has two teenage boys with ex-husband Tommy Lee, gushed about Rick during a speech at the Cannes Film Festival earlier this year.

After surprising the press by opening up about sexual attacks she endured during her childhood, Pamela called Rick her 'Angel.'

'He is the only man besides my boys that I trust,' she said. 

She added: 'His way of helping the world to be a better place is by caring for me, protecting me and making me happy. I am so proud of him.'
