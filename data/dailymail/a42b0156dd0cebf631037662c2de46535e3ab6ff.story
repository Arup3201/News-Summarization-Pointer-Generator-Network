Japan is braced for torrential rain and 120mph winds as Super Typhoon Vongfong sweeps north towards the country's southern islands. 

The storm, which will be Japan's second typhoon in a week, was moving extremely slowly on Friday afternoon - raising the risk of landslides and flooding when it makes landfall this weekend. 

Satellite images taken of Vongfong, which means 'wasp' in Cantonese, suggest that the eye of the hurricane is approximately 50 miles wide.

Striking: Nasa astronaut Reid Wiseman, who is currently serving as a flight engineer aboard the International Space Station, tweeted this striking picture of Vongfong - swirling across the ocean

Approach: Waves smashing the shores of the island of Okinawa, southern Japan, show waves up to 50ft high 

Threatening: Infrared satellite images suggest that the eye of the hurricane is approximately 50 miles wide

Vongfong is currently following the path of Phanfone, a typhoon that slammed the mainland on Monday, disrupting transport and prompting evacuation advisories for hundreds of thousands of people

Earlier in the day, Nasa astronaut Reid Wiseman, who is currently serving as a flight engineer aboard the International Space Station, tweeted a picture of Vongfong, and said: 'I’ve seen many from here, but none like this.' 

His striking shot shows thick white clouds swirling across the ocean. 

At one point the typhoon rivalled last year's devastating typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest tropical cyclones ever recorded, which killed more than 6,000 people in the Philippines alone when it struck in December last year. 

Vongfong is expected to weaken further as it crosses the open ocean. There have already been reports of waves that are up to 50ft high.

'There is no question that it is an extremely large, extremely powerful typhoon,' an official at Japan's Meteorological Agency (JMA) said.

'It's the strongest storm we've had this year, definitely, although it has lost some strength from its peak.' 

It was likely to be closest to Okinawa, an island chain 1,000 miles southwest of Tokyo, and the home of the largest contingent of U.S. troops in Japan, late on Saturday or early on Sunday.

Dangerous: Waves batter the coast in Tamagusuku, Nanjo city on the southern island of Okinawa. The typhoon is expected to make landfall at some point this weekend 

Deadly: This satellite image from NASA shows the eye of Super Typhoon Vongfong in the Philippine Sea.  At one point the typhoon rivalled last year's devastating typhoon Haiyan, which killed more than 6,000 people

Slow moving: The creeping speed of the typhoon raises the risk of landslides and floods once it makes landfall

Television broadcast images of residents of Minami Daitojima, an island southeast of Okinawa, boarding up windows ahead of the storm.

Government officials were set to meet on Friday night to coordinate their response, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a regular news conference.

Suga said: 'We are calling on all citizens to pay close attention to weather reports and respond promptly if the authorities advise them to evacuate.'

The typhoon was expected to weaken as it moved north, however, and likely to hit land on Sunday on the westernmost main island of Kyushu, before moving northeast towards Japan's largest main island of Honshu, where it is likely to weaken into a tropical storm. Tokyo was set for heavy rain, at the worst.

Tropical Storm Risk, which tracks typhoons, labelled Vongfong as a Category 4 typhoon, set to weaken to Category 2 before hitting Kyushu.

There are no nuclear plants on Okinawa, but there are two on Kyushu and one on Shikoku island, which borders Kyushu and may be hit. All are currently halted in line with national policy.

The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, crippled by an earthquake and tsunami in 2011, is on the other side of the country, which is likely to see rain at the worst.

Vongfong is currently following the path of Phanfone, a typhoon that slammed the mainland on Monday, disrupting transport and prompting evacuation advisories for hundreds of thousands of people.

Seven people were killed, including three U.S. airmen swept out to sea and a man who died while surfing. 

It was unusual for two powerful typhoons to hit Japan in such quick succession, the JMA official said, but added the overall number of such storms had not increased.

'It's more coincidence than anything else, mainly due to the way the high pressure systems are located off Japan this year.'
