A politician's 'spur of the moment' idea for Comic Relief left her more than £14,000 out of pocket after promising £1 for every retweet she received on Twitter.

Slough MP Fiona Mactaggart, who once spent Red Nose Day dressed as a chicken when she was a teacher, has donated £14,268 to the charity after thousands of people retweeted her post on the social networking site.

She admitted being 'Twitter naive' before sending the message but told followers she could afford it.

Although she had always planned to write a cheque for Comic Relief, the Labour MP said she had the sum of £10,000 in mind, and admitted she was 'a bit' worried as the number of retweets steadily increased.

Slough MP Fiona Mactaggart tweeted that she would donate £1 for every retweet of her first messsage, top, and by the 9pm deadline more than 14,000 people had done their bit to make her open her chequebook

The British public took part in thousands of fundraising stunts and generously donated money to help raise a record £75million for Comic Relief last night.

Some of the UK's biggest celebrities and presenters took part in fundraising extravaganza on Red Nose Day yesterday, with singer Jessie J shaving off her long hair, One Direction performing live, and comedian Peter Kay travelling the length of the country on a sofa.

Fiona Mactaggart said she has already handed over the cheque to Comic Relief

By the end of the live broadcast, viewers had donated £75,107,851 - a record total for on-the-night donations, which pipped 2011's £74.3million.

Ms Mactaggart tweeted: 'I will give £1.00 to Comic relief for every retweet of this message before 9pm.'

The MP received a number of negative 
tweets suggesting that she would claim the donation back on her expenses
- a reaction that annoyed her.

'"I was surprised by that, and depressed by it,' she said.

'I had always planned to write a big cheque for Comic Relief. Doing it that way wasn't a carefully planned campaign.

'I think if it had been it would have cost me a lot more, because people would have been ready to start retweeting as it were.

'When I was a teacher, before I was 
an MP, I taught for the whole day dressed up as a chicken, and got 
sponsored for Red Nose Day.

'I am prepared to do peculiar things for this good cause. Maybe this will encourage people to do peculiar things as it were.

Ms Mactaggart said the cheque has already been handed over to Comic Relief.

A host of stars featured in sketches 
on the BBC broadcast to persuade the public to donate to good causes 
that help thousands of people in the UK and Africa.

Music
mogul Simon Cowell walked down the aisle and rejected advances from 
David Walliams, Louis Walsh, Dermot O'Leary and Olly Murs, only to marry
himself, while Ricky Gervais resurrected the character of David Brent 
from The Office.

Pop stars One Direction performed the official Comic Relief single, a cover version of Blondie's One Way or Another which also samples The Undertones' Teenage Kicks, while band member Louis Tomlinson dyed his hair red for the occasion.

There were also outings for TV shows the Vicar Of Dibley and Call The Midwife, while comedians Jack Whitehall and Micky Flanagan attempted their best dishes for Comic Relief does MasterChef, in a head-to-head cook-off for Dame Edna Everage.

But there were also reminders of what Red Nose Day and Comic Relief are about, with moving films on the effects of malaria, pneumonia and starvation in Africa and domestic abuse in the UK.

The night of entertainment was hosted by celebrities including Davina McCall, Claudia Winkleman, John Bishop, Jonathan Ross and Comic Relief co-founder Lenny Henry.

Singer Jessie J raised more than £500,000 when she had her head shaved.

She told host Dermot O'Leary, who seemed to be enjoying stroking her newly-bald head, that: 'It's the weirdest feeling.'

She had admitted being nervous 
beforehand, but told viewers: 'It feels so liberating. But this isn't 
about this (gesturing to her head), it's about donating.'

The
singer said it was 'amazing' to have raised so much money, and added: 
'Everyone's crying. My mum's back there, crying with happiness.'

Jessie,
who has visited Comic Relief-funded project Body & Soul which helps
young people living with HIV, said: 'I feel exhilarated to be able to 
have the opportunity to raise money for people that aren't fortunate 
enough to say something and be heard.'

The
BT Red Nose challenge - a five-day trip down the Zambezi River in 
Africa by comedians Dara O'Briain and Jack Dee, singer Melanie C, 
actress Chelsee Healey, triple jumper Phillips Idowu and Radio 1 DJ Greg
James - also raised almost £1.2million.

A
week of madcap challenges by comedian Miranda Hart, including 
organising a real life wedding in a matter of hours,  raised 
£1.1million.

David Walliams shared an intimate 
secret with celebrities he had become close to over the year, including 
Kate Moss, Alan Carr and Hugh Grant, while Rowan Atkinson addressed the 
nation on the importance of fundraising - in the guise of the Archbishop
of Canterbury.

Thousands
of people across the UK did their bit for the cause, dressing up for 
work yesterday, taking cakes into work and holding wacky fundraising 
events.

Sainsbury's also donated more than £10million through sales of Red Nose Day merchandise, TK Maxx raised £3.7million through sales of the Red Nose Day T-shirts, designed by Stella McCartney, and homeware, and British Airways donated more than £2million.

The Government also promised to back the public's support with a donation of £16million to the overall total, specifically for Comic Relief's work to improve the lives of women and girls in Africa.

BT's 10,000 volunteers handled 458,000 calls to the donation line during the live TV show, peaking at 200 calls per second.

Comic Relief co-founder Richard Curtis said: 'Once again the extraordinary generosity of the British public has put Comic Relief in a position to be able to serve thousands upon thousands of people with very hard lives in Africa and the UK.

'It's almost impossible to thank enough all those who took part in the event, all the members of the public who fund-raised and all those who gave so generously on the night.'
