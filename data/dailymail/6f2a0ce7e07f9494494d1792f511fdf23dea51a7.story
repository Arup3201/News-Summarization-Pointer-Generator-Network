Tottenham's Emmanuel Sonupe scored an 89th-minute winner at the Lamex Stadium on Monday night as Chelsea missed the chance to go top of the Under 21 Premier League.

In a tight contest that looked to be headed for a stalemate, Sonupe settled the match in the closing stages as he rifled an effort into the roof of the net after the ball broke to the 18-year-old in the Chelsea box.

The goal condemned the Blues to their first Under 21 Premier League defeat of the season as the home side shaded a tight match that was largely bereft of chances and quality.

In an entertaining first half both goalkeepers were called into action during the early stages.

Chelsea striker Dominic Solanke, who made his first-team debut when he came on as a second-half substitute during last week's 6-0 Champions League win over Maribor, saw his effort smothered by Spurs keeper Luke McGee.

And moments later influential Tottenham midfielder Christian Ceballos forced Chelsea keeper Mitchell Beeney into a smart save.

The home side enjoyed plenty of first-half possession including a succession of corners as Spurs heaped pressure on the Chelsea defence, but without creating a clear chance.

Tottenham: McGee, McQueen, Ogilvie, Lesniak, Ball, Carter-Vickers, Sonupe, Winks, Ceballos (Akindayini, 80), Onomah (Lameiras, 73), Miller

Goals: Sonupe, 89

Chelsea: Beeney, Kane, Davey, Aina, Dabo, Houghton (Colkett, 45), Loftus-Cheek, Kiwomya, Boga (Palmer, 69), Masonda, Solanke

And it was Spurs keeper McGee, who had remained a by-stander for much of the half, that had to react brilliantly to tip Fankaty Dabo's effort over the bar.

Chelsea finished the first half the stronger of the two sides as McGee had to be alert again to keep out Alex Davey's header before the 19-year-old saved from Solanke as the half ended goalless.

Chelsea started brightly after the interval and Charly Masonda hit a rasping drive but the 18-year-old's strike whistled over McGee's goal.

Will Miller was put through on 65 minutes after a neat Tottenham move but Beeney was out quickly to deny the Spurs forward. 

Ola Aina made a break from the Chelsea defence and was put through with a perfectly weighted pass, but saw his effort brilliantly saved by McGee as the Chelsea defender attempted to lift it over the on-rushing keeper.

As the second half began to fizzle out Alex Kiwomya's low drive on 82 minutes took a wicked deflection on the way through to McGee, who got down superbly to make a one-handed save.

And with the match heading for a draw Sonupe smashed home the winner as Tottenham snatched the three points at the death.
