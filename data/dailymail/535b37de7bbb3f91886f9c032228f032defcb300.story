Sir Cliff Richard has firmly denied the allegation of sexual assault

Sir Cliff Richard has no idea who is behind an allegation of sexual assault but has vowed to continue working to clear his name.

The accusation, first revealed on August 14, prompted controversy after it was revealed the BBC and South Yorkshire Police cut a deal which tipped off the BBC to a raid on Sir Cliff's home.

Now a friend has now reportedly said Sir Cliff, 73, wants the accusation to be dealt with as soon as possible so he can get on with his life.

His friend told The Mirror: 'He doesn’t know his accuser. He has no idea when his ordeal will end.'

He added Sir Cliff had told his friends the accusation was unfounded.

Sir Cliff told them: 'Nothing will come out of the woodwork because I’ve absolutely nothing to hide.’

Detectives swooped on his £3.1million apartment in Berkshire last month amid accusations he sexually assaulted a 15-year-old schoolboy at a Christian rally almost three decades ago.

And just three days ago Sir Cliff - who is currently staying at his holiday home in the Algarve, Portugal - released a statement on Facebook vowing to clear his name.

In it he thanked members of the public, fans and 'those in the press' for their support.

He wrote: 'Hi everyone, this is just a brief message to thank all of you who have shown support, including those in the Press.

'I wanted to let you know that I'm doing ok and it goes without saying that I fully intend to clear my name.

'Just to be absolutely clear, the allegation is completely false and I will continue to cooperate with the police should they wish to speak to me again.

Once again...many thanks!'

It was the second public statement he has made since the allegation was first revealed.

His first comments came on August 14, in which he acknowledged 'completely false' claims of 'sexual impropriety' had been circulating online for months.

He stated: 'Up until now I have chosen not to dignify the false allegations with a response, as it would just give them more oxygen.'

In a reference to the BBC's coverage of the raid, he added: 'However, the police attended my apartment in Berkshire today without notice, except it would appear to the press.'

Sir Cliff has spoken to police but has not been arrested or charged.

Meanwhile, one of the country's senior police officers was accused of 'sheer incompetence' last week over his handling of the raid, which was aired live on the BBC.

During a Home Affairs Select Committee hearing, chairman  Keith Vaz told South Yorkshire Police Constable David Crompton his committee was amazed at what appeared to be 'sheer incompetence' in dealing with the matter.

The BBC and South Yorkshire police clashed over how TV reporters were able to film live aerial shots of the search last month.

Mr Crompton said the BBC put his force in 'a very difficult position' after confronting officers with leaked information about the planned search in connection with allegations of a historic sexual assault.

He added his force was convinced that the broadcaster would run a story about the investigation without some kind of deal.

Committee MP Julian Huppert asked Mr Crompton if the compromise was a common method in dealing with the media as opposed to a  'rather remarkable blackmail attempt'.

But the BBC flatly rejected the accusation and claimed they would have pulled the story if the police had asked.
