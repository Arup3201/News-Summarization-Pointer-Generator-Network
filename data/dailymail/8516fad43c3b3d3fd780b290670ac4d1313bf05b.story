A member of one of Britain's oldest aristocratic families was today jailed for two years after repeatedly beating his wife in a series of drink- and drug-fuelled rampages over two decades.

Lord Edward Somerset left his wife Caroline needing hospital treatment after bruising, scratching and pulling her hair at their home on the Badminton Estate in Gloucestershire.

The attacks took place over a 22-year period, and were often motivated by arguments about the peer's addiction to alcohol and drugs including heroin and cocaine.

In 2011, Lady Caroline received an 'incredibly hard' kick to her foot after challenging her husband when he moved his new girlfriend into their home while they were still married.

She was later treated in hospital after arguing with Somerset, 55, third son of the 11th Duke of Beaufort, when he took crack cocaine in front of their youngest daughter Rose.

Judge Mark Horton jailed the peer for two years after he pleaded guilty to actual bodily harm at Bristol Crown Court.

'This is a case of two tragedies,' the judge said. 'A tragedy of a man born to privilege and almost limitless opportunities whose life has been marred and destroyed by an addiction to alcohol and drugs and an uncontrollable temper.

'The tragedy with which the court is concerned is the tragedy caused to your wife by you over a period of 22 years by your repeated and deliberate violence.

'You abused your position of power over your wife, not only physically but more importantly by psychological and emotional damage caused by that physical control.'

He also imposed a restraining order to protect Lady Caroline, who now lives in Australia, from her estranged husband.

Divorce proceedings between the couple - who have two daughters, Francesca and Rose - are set to be finalised in the near future.

Prosecuting, Eleanor Laws QC told the court: 'The couple were married for over 30 years, during which he subjected his wife to incidents of serious, repeated domestic violence.'

Ms Laws said the marriage started as a 'happy one', with the 'hedonistic' couple moving to New York where they 'indulged in a party lifestyle'.

The family moved to London soon after Francesca's birth, but Lady Caroline realised Somerset had a drink problem and was taking heroin.

'When she confronted him, the arguments resulted in him being violent towards her,' Ms Laws said. 'Their dysfunctional marriage continued in the same vein.

'Many of their arguments were fuelled by alcohol as it was only when she had been drinking that she had the courage to confront him about his drinking and drug use.'

In July 1991, the pair started arguing while on a trip to visit a friend in France.

'He reacted by dragging her across the floor and punched her to the head and body,' Ms Laws said. 'She received two black eyes, bruising to her arms and a dislocated finger that required hospital treatment.'

Despite this, the couple returned to England together and moved into Essex House on the Badminton Estate, where daughter Rose was born in 1992.

Three years ago, Lady Caroline underwent treatment for alcohol abuse and moved to London with Rose, returning to the Badminton Estate at weekends to see her husband.

But in late 2011, Somerset began a relationship with another woman and invited her to stay at the family home during the week.

'Lady Caroline was still telling herself that she hoped things would improve,' Ms Laws said. 'She confided in friends but she could not imagine living another life. She felt protective towards her husband's family.'

In November 2011, Lady Caroline was alone at Essex House with Somerset when an argument about his new girlfriend flared and he kicked his wife in the foot, making her fear she had broken a bone.

She confronted him about smoking crack in front of Rose in October 2012, and he kicked her in the ribs and punched her in the stomach.

Doctors reported Lady Caroline's injuries to police, who subsequently interviewed Somerset.

He told officers: 'I shouldn't do it, I know. That is what worries me, I think I could go further one day. It was all so undignified.'

In a victim impact statement, Lady Caroline, who initially refused to cooperate with police, said: 'I don't know why Edward assaulted me and though he apologised, he never explained.

'I lost my confidence, my self-esteem and believed everything was my fault. I would state I have suffered enormous emotional and psychological damage.'

Representing Somerset, William Clegg QC said his client estimated there no more than three periods of domestic violence in the 30-year marriage.

Speaking after the case, Rob Allen of the Crown Prosecution Service said: 'This case is a reminder that domestic violence permeates all sections of our society.'
