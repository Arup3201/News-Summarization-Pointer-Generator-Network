Could the secret to less stress, improved health and enjoying a better night's sleep be found in a transparent house? That's what one company is claiming, and they say living in glass homes can improve our overall wellbeing.

Of course location would play a part; living in the centre of a busy park might not be as relaxing or quaint as living, say, out among the trees in the English countryside. 

But the company says that by being exposed to sunlight more regularly, our circadian rhythms work properly and our bodies know how to better regulate themselves.

Cosy? A London-based company is planning to build transparent homes. The Photon Space project is currently seeking funding for the all-glass houses (artist's illustration shown)

The team of architects and scientists used the latest in all-glass technology to come up with The Photon Space, a house made entirely of glass.

The multi-layered, high-performance glass walls, bonded to curved glass beams, are fully transparent, which allows natural light to flood in, boosting the health, mood and productivity of those inside, according to the company.

The Photon Space has also been designed so it is never too hot or too cold and can be darkened for privacy via smartphone, night or day, using the latest nanotechnology. 

Earlier this year researchers in New York provided clear physical evidence that sleep fortifies learning.

The finding adds to research that a lack of shut eye causes rogue proteins to build up in the eye, increasing the risk for Alzheimer’s disease.

Using a microscope, scientists looked inside the brains of mice to see what happened when they were either asleep, or sleep-deprived, after being trained to walk on top of a rotating rod for the first time.

They found learning led to the formation of new dendritic spines - tiny structures that project from the end of nerve cells and help pass electric signals from one neuron to another - but only in the mice left to sleep.

The study, published in Science, provides the first physical evidence of how sleep helps to consolidate and strengthen new memories. 

The 485 square-foot (45 square-metre) house, with 360 degree views, includes a living room, double bedroom, kitchen and bathroom, and takes just four weeks to build.

The pods will 'retail' for £210,000 ($330,000), with a luxury version available for £260,000 ($410,000).  

All the homes can be designed according to the request of the customer, however, including the size and shape of the structure. 

It has also been suggested for use as an office, cafe or base on a safari park, among others, with its steel sub-frame making it suitable for building at most locations.

The double-glazed glass panels have apparently a high-performance in insulation and also block adequate amounts of solar radiation: 63 per cent.

They also block 99.9 per cent of ultraviolet light, and can keep out 85 per cent of sound.

When constructed, the building also touches the ground ‘lightly’ in the words of the team, so it can be removed with little impact on the surroundings.

‘The intention is for The Photon Space to “nest” in the environment and become embedded in the surroundings,’ they write on their website.

However they note this will not always be possible, and suggest the structures could also be placed on top of roofs in cities.

Quite how much privacy you'd be afforded in such a home, though, might be somewhat called into question.

While the walls can be tinted to block out prying eyes, it's unlikely the occupant would want them tinted all the time, considering the purpose of the house is to let in more light.

And location would also be key; it almost certainly wouldn't be as fun living at the centre of a busy park as opposed to, say, a nice secluded piece of countryside. 

Each custom built abode contains a bedroom, kitchen, toilet and lounge. The glass walls can be tinted for privacy or when going to sleep

Each home takes up a space of 485 square-feet (45 square-metres). When and where they will be built has not been revealed, but the company says they could be built on top of roofs

Charlie Sharman, managing director of The Photon Project, said: 'This exciting project combines years of research, glass innovation, engineering and architecture to provide a new way to restore, relax and rejuvenate. 

'In our modern lives we spend too much time indoors, despite the fact that scientific research shows that daylight has profound benefits for our health, mood and productivity.

'We have ignored the fact that we still require exposure to natural light for psychological and physiological reasons to stay in tune with our biological clocks and to keep us healthy and happy.'

The design has been supported by the long-term studies by Oxford University's Professor Russell Foster into human's response to natural light. 

The inventors are now seeking funding through Crowdcube to make the glass houses more widely available.

Designer Brent Richards said: 'I have always been fascinated by the opportunity to explore the benefits of glass and harness its capacity to capture light and space.

'As an architect with a passion for glass, I'm excited to discover leading research by Oxford University confirm that natural light provides the critical input to our biological system, synchronising of body clock to our natural environment.'
