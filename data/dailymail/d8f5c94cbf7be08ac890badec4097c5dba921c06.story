Stephen Sutton, who was first diagnosed with bowel cancer aged 15, is back in hospital with tumors blocking his airways according to his family

The family of terminally ill teenager Stephen Sutton have taken to Facebook to let his supporters know his condition has 'deteriorated' and he can no longer communicate himself.

The 19-year-old, who has raised more than £3.22 million for the Teenage Cancer Trust, was readmitted to hospital with breathing difficulties on Sunday.

Stephen touched the hearts of the nation after posting a picture on his Facebook page where he said his 'last goodbye' to his friends and family at Birmingham Queen Elizabeth hospital.

After an internet campaign saw his fundraising target of £1million smashed, he made a mild recovery and was allowed home.

But last night his family posted a message on Facebook which read: 'Unfortunately in the last 24 hours Stephen's condition has deteriorated to where he can no longer communicate through this page himself.

'Unfortunately the breathlessness which had him re-admitted to hospital is due to the regrowth of tumours which are blocking his airways, and not just due to infection as we had all been hoping.

'He is currently comfortable and stable, and we will let you know of any further developments.

'Right now however, as a family, we wish for a certain amount of privacy for us to spend what time he has remaining with him.

Stephen, who is now 19, raised the money through a series of inspirational blog posts which saw his fundraising total rise from £10,000, to £1million to £3million

Stephen drew up a bucket list when he was told his cancer was terminal which included skydiving. He managed to tick off 36 of the 46 tasks on the list, including raising money for charity

'We appreciate everyone's concern, and for all the love and goodwill sent his way, and indeed ours too, we thank you deeply x.'

Stephen returned to his home in Burntwood, Staffs., was diagnosed with colorectal cancer in 2010 when he was just 15 but despite having the tumour removed from his bowel it returned the next year.

Despite being told he would be unlikely to survive more than a few years, he decided to make a 46 part bucket-list of things to do before he dies. Top of his list was to raise £10,000 for the Teenage Cancer Trust.

Three weeks ago, his blog went viral when, with a collapsed lung and believing he was ‘a goner’, the teenager posted a picture of himself in a hospital bed giving his trademark thumbs-up sign. His message touched hearts across the world.

‘It’s a final thumbs-up from me,’ he wrote. ‘I’ve done well to blag things as well as I have up till now, but unfortunately I think this is just one hurdle too far.

Stephen's trademark thumbs-up pose was coined after he sent a message from his hospital bed with the message 'a final thumbs up from me' (pictured, David Cameron poses with Stephen two weeks ago)

‘It’s a 
shame the end has come so suddenly. There’s so many people I haven’t got
 round to properly thank  or say goodbye to. Apologies for that . . .

‘Whatever
 happens next I want you all to know I am currently in a good place 
mentally and at ease with the situation. That’s it from me. But life has been good. Very good.’

Money began to flood in for his nominated charity. To date, he has raised more than £3.2 million.

He has also managed to tick off 36 of the 46 tasks on his bucket-list.

Last week it emerged 25,000 people had signed a petition to award Stephen a knighthood - with signatures coming from as far away as India and Australia.
