Cam Newton looked remarkably healthy as he took to the sidelines to watch his Carolina Panthers take on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the first game since he was injured in a terrifying car crash last week. 

While the 25-year-old suffered two traverse fractures in the accident, NFL reporter Ian Rapoport revealed Sunday that he could return to the field as early as next week's game against the Cleveland Browns. 

The quarterback is taking it easy for now, sitting out today's game and letting back-up quarterback Derek Anderson lead the Panthers offense.

He previously brushed off comments on his return, saying he's just glad to be alive.

'As far as when I am coming back, who cares? That's not something that I am worried about right now. I am just thankful to have breath in my lungs,' Newton told the Charlotte Observer.

Last week, Newton spoke with the Observer to describe the horrifying  crash just a block from Panthers stadium.

Newton said he was travelling through an intersection in his black pick-up truck on Tuesday when a driver in a Buick sedan pulled out into the intersection. 

He says he tried to avoid the car, but was clipped and the T-bone crash caused his truck to flip and roll several times. 

'I really couldn't talk afterward because I was in such shock,' Newton said. 'I got myself out of the truck, and I couldn't stop smiling.'

Safe and sound: Newton was able to escape his vehicle and pull himself to safety on a nearby sidewalk. He says he was so happy to be alive, he couldn't stop smiling

Indeed, pictures of Newton after the crash show him grinning from ear to ear as he lay down on the sidewalk with an police officer attending to him.

He was later moved to a gurney and transported to the hospital where he spent the night healing, and was released Wednesday. 

While Newton was religious before the crash, he says the brush with death reaffirmed his faith in God.

'I am on somebody's fantasy league and I think it is the man upstairs,' he said.

Neither Newton or the driver of the sedan have been ticketed in the crash. Police say Newton was travelling within the speed limit.
