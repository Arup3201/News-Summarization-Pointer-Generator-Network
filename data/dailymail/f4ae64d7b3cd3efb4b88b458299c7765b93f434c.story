Pressure is growing on leading bankers to follow the example of Royal Bank of Scotland boss Stephen Hester and give up multi-million-pound bonuses.

As hundreds more RBS employees wait to hear what they can expect from a bonus pot of around £500million this year, Business Secretary Vince Cable called for a ‘sense of perspective’ in an age of austerity for most.

RBS investment banking boss John Hourican remains in line for a salary and bonus of up to £5.9million.

And Mr Hourican, who will oversee a 
restructuring including around 3,500 job losses, could later this year 
receive as much as £5.7million in long-term incentive shares that he was
 awarded in 2009, providing targets are met.

Ellen Alemany, a U.S.-based executive,
 could also get £5.9million in salary and bonus and is in line for a 
£1.6million shares windfall. On Sunday Mr Hester, RBS’s chief executive,
 bowed to pressure and told the board of the bank, which is 82 per cent 
owned by the taxpayer, that he would not accept his 2011 shares award 
worth £963,000.

Labour leader Ed Miliband insisted 
yesterday that the row over Mr Hester’s bonus must not be a ‘one-off 
episode’ and called on the Government to reintroduce a specific tax on 
bankers’ bonuses and put a worker on the board of every firm to help set
 executive pay.

Coalition tensions over the issue are 
threatening to burst into the open, with Liberal Democrats complaining 
last night that the Treasury ‘stonewalled’ for months over the issue of 
Mr Hester’s bonus.

Hands-off approach: Prime Minister David Cameron, left, does not want to 'micro-manage' the bonuses of senior RBS staff while Business Secretary Vince Cable, right, called for a 'sense of persepective'

A Lib Dem source said the Treasury 
must now take a more hands-on approach to avoid further controversies at
 RBS, which is still largely owned by the taxpayer having been steered 
close to collapse.

‘Rather than just sighing and saying 
“this isn’t ideal, but there’s not much we can do”, we need to look at 
what has happened and get a grip on the issue. Surely once bitten, twice
 shy,’ the source said.

Asked whether the Prime Minister was 
happy to see other RBS executives receive million-pound bonuses, a 
Downing Street spokesman said: ‘What we are not going to be doing is 
micro-managing.

‘This Government has taken action to 
ensure that bonuses are responsible, they are much lower, there is a cap
 on cash bonuses of £2,000 and we are reforming the whole system.’

It was ‘a matter for individuals’ whether they chose to accept any bonus they are offered, she added.

But Mr Cable said Mr Hester’s decision to give up his bonus was a ‘good step to dealing with the bonus culture more generally’.

The Business Secretary added: ‘I’m not
 dictating… but I think he has set a good example. I think that more 
generally in the banking sector we have got to see more of a sense of 
perspective.

‘We have got to focus on what the bank
 is for and what the performance actually means. I just want to focus 
very clearly on getting proper bank lending to good British companies.’

But Right-wing Tories warned that politicians meddled in RBS’s affairs at their peril.

Some said Mr Hester and other members 
of the bank’s board could walk away having been publicly humiliated, a 
huge  risk given the bank’s massive balance sheet and the danger to the 
public finances if it cannot be sold back to the private sector.

Mark Field, Tory MP for the Cities of 
London and Westminster, warned that a ‘lynch mob mentality’ was putting 
the vital financial services industry in peril.

The head of the Financial Services 
Authority admitted yesterday that supervision of Britain’s banks was 
‘grossly inadequate’ in the run-up to the credit crunch.

Hector Sants told the Commons Treasury
 committee he was ‘truly sorry’ for the impact of the banking crisis on 
small shareholders and taxpayers.

The former investment banker 
acknowledged that he had been instrumental in persuading RBS to ask 
shareholders for £1billion in 2008 as it struggled to boost its cash 
reserves – a decision which led to heavy losses for shareholders when 
the bank collapsed months later.
