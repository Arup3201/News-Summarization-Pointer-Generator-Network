Drink-related early death rates among low paid workers like bar staff, cleaners and labourers are four times higher than well-paid professionals, a new study showed today.

Total death rates linked to alcohol have fallen to their lowest level since 2000, the Office for National Statistics said.

But there are 'substantial' differences between ages and jobs with those in 'routine occupations' likely to have higher death rates and lose more potential years of working life because of alcohol-related deaths.

In 2011, alcohol-related death rates were highest for those in routine occupations such as bar staff, cleaners and labourers, with 29.5 and 12.6 deaths per 100,000 men and women respectively

Those in routine occupations tended to have higher death rates and lose more potential years of working life because of alcohol-related deaths

In 2013 there were 8,416 alcohol-related deaths registered in the UK, equivalent to a rate of 14 deaths per 100,000 people. It is the lowest rate since 2000, when it stood at 13.1 per 100,000.

Two thirds of all deaths linked to alcohol were among men. For both sexes, death rates were highest among those aged 60-64 years (45.3 deaths per 100,000 men and 22.4 per 100,000 women).

The ONS said that alcohol-related death among men increased steadily across age groups, rising from 0.3 per 100,000 population for those aged 20-24 to a peak of 45.3 per 100,000 for those aged 60-64 years.

For women, the lowest death rate was among those aged 20-24 (0.2 per 100,000) and highest was among 60-64 year olds (22.4 per 100,000).

Death rates were similar among men and women for those aged 20-24 and 85-89.

But in all other age groups, the alcohol-related death rate for men was approximately twice that of women. For those aged 90 years and over, the rate for men was three times higher than that of women.

A linked study released today examined how death rates varied between people in differing jobs.

The ONS said the latest analysis shows 'substantial socio-economic and gender inequality in alcohol-related deaths among working-age adults'.

'Those in routine occupations tended to have higher death rates and lose more potential years of working life because of alcohol-related deaths than those in more advantaged socio-economic classes,' the ONS said.

In 2011, alcohol-related death rates were highest for those in routine occupations such as bar staff, cleaners and labourers, with 29.5 and 12.6 deaths per 100,000 men and women respectively.

The ONS said that alcohol-related death among men increased steadily across age groups, rising from 0.3 per 100,000 population for those aged 20-24 to a peak of 45.3 per 100,000 for those aged 60-64 years

By contrast rates were lowest for those working in higher managerial and professional occupations like doctors, IT strategy and planning professionals and lawyers, with 7.3 deaths per 100,000 men and 5.2 deaths per 100,000 women.

'This meant that alcohol-related death rates for those in routine occupations were four times greater for men and two times greater for women, than those in professional roles,' the ONS added.

The largest difference between the sexes was among semi-routine occupations, which includes veterinary nurses, traffic wardens and security guards.

In this group of workers, the rate was almost three times greater for men than women. In contrast, the higher managerial and professional occupations were the only class without a significant gender difference in the alcohol-related death rates. 

Elaine Hindal, Chief Executive of alcohol education charity Drinkaware, said: 'It's encouraging to see that alcohol related deaths are at their lowest since 2000. 

'However it's concerning to see the continued trend of alcohol related deaths disproportionately affecting men and those who work in more manual occupations.

'This is particularly worrying because ONS data shows that despite those in higher managerial and professional jobs drinking more, those they employ are more likely to die from alcohol related cause. This may be because those workers are more likely to have poorer overall health and are less likely to seek medical advice at the first sign of symptoms.'
