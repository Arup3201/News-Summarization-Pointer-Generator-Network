Royal Navy frigate HMS Montrose has been deployed to the Baltic Sea for Nato military exercises tomorrow, amid continuing tension with Russia over Ukraine.

British armed forces are to take part in three military exercises in the Baltic area to provide ‘reassurance’ to allies in Eastern Europe, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said.

HMS Montrose will take part in Baltops, the largest multi-national naval exercise in the Baltic Sea this year, to improve maritime security in the region, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said.

The event tomorrow aims to enhance co-ordination and co-operation among Baltic Sea countries, the MoD added.

More than 100 soldiers have also been deployed to Estonia and Latvia for a live-fire training exercise called Sabre Strike.

The
 soldiers from 1st Battalion the Princess of Wales Royal Regiment will 
take part in the test today, along with 12 artillery and engineer 
experts, and two exercise controllers in the Adazi training area near 
the Latvian capital Riga.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said the situation in Ukraine continued to be 'of great concern to the international community'

Military personnel from Denmark, Estonia, 
Finland, Lithuania, Latvia and Norway are involved along with 580 US 
servicemen and women.

Meanwhile, about 200 British infantry troops 
will take part in the live-fire exercise Anakonda in Poland in 
September, the MoD said.

The RAF has already sent four Typhoons to join Nato's air policing mission over its Baltic member countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.

Troops from 1st Battalion The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment also recently worked alongside the Estonian counterparts on Exercise Steadfast Javelin.

Mr Hammond said: 'The situation in Ukraine continues to be of great concern to the international community and it is right that Nato members and partners publicly demonstrate our commitment to the collective security of our Nato allies.

'The UK continues to play a central role in providing reassurance to our allies in Eastern Europe and the Baltic states.

'Our contribution to these exercises builds on other action we have taken, including the deployment of RAF Typhoons to the Nato air policing mission in the Baltic states.'
