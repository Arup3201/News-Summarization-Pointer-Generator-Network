It was revealed on Tuesday night’s special EasEnders episode that Lucy Beale had been killed in her own home.

And on the latest instalment of the BBC One soap, the ongoing murder mystery unravelled even further when a distraught Peter Beale (Ben Hardy) was finally told the truth by his girlfriend Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa), who pointed the finger at his own parents.

In a dramatic cliffhanger showdown, the troubled youngster rushed home to confront his father Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) and stepmother Jane (Laurie Brett) after they tied the knot in front of all their family and friends, accusing one  of them of murdering his twin sister.

Distraught: Peter Beale was finally told the truth about his twin sister's murder by girlfriend Lauren Branning

After an emotional confrontation with Lauren, who has pieced together the clues in detective Emma Summerhayes' case file, the semi-live episode ended with Peter bursting into the family home and declaring, ‘Lauren’s told me - Lucy was killed in this house… and it was one of you!’

This was only the second bombshell of the evening, since it was also revealed that Lauren is expecting  Peter’s child.

She had fled Albert Square to avoid a confrontation, but her father Max Branning found her waiting in an abortion clinic after uncovering the truth about the pregnancy by checking her phone.

Suspicious: Jane had been wracked with nerves since reading Lauren's note and was extremely flustered while saying her wedding vows to Ian

Surprise! It was revealed that Lauren is expecting Peter's child, with her father Max turning up at an abortion clinic to talk her into keeping the baby

He proceeded to talk her out of making a rash decision, all the while probing whether she would be going to the police about Lucy's killer since he still believes that his youngest daughter Abi is the culprit.

‘I’m not doing it because I don’t love it. I’m doing this because I already do. It’s for the best’, Lauren cryptically declared.

And when Abi spilled the beans to Peter, he missed his own father's wedding to find Lauren at the clinic and tell her he wants to keep the baby.

Shocker: Max Branning confronted his daughter Lauren at an abortion clinic

‘I always wanted kids. Loads of them and I want them with you’, he pleaded. ‘I know we’d be young parents, but we’d be really good at it. I’d do everything for you… both of you.’

But it seems Lauren has already made up her mind and wants nothing to do with the Beale family, deciding to tell Peter the terrible truth about who killed his twin sister all those months ago.

Jane and Ian – who have both been prime suspects in the never-ending murder mystery – certainly raised suspicions throughout the episode as they were both visibly dealing with guilt.

As they exchanged vows, Lauren’s note (which featured prominently in Tuesday’s programme) preyed heavily on Jane’s mind.

Visibly flustered, she paused the ceremony to ask where Peter was and stopped to get a glass of water.

Anxious: Jane struggled to go through with the ceremony and is  hiding something from her family

Recovering enough to continue with the wedding, she made a speedy exit during the pub after-party and seemed to be preparing for the worst when Ian came to find her at home, shortly followed by Peter.

As suspected, the Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald) storyline from the first of this week’s special 30th anniversary episodes was a red herring.

The soap kicked off with the outraged blonde querying why her father Max thought she had killed Lucy.

‘You were pretty angry with her. You might have pushed her, she might have banged her head or something’, he explained.

Abi retorted: ‘I told you we had a row, and I slapped her!’

Not guilty: The Abi Branning bombshell turned out to be a red herring, although she did confess  she wished she had killed Lucy, who was having an affair with her father

Dubious Max was still convinced his youngest daughter is the culprit and tried to cover it up from her mother Tanya Branning, who  returned to Albert Square especially for Ian and Jane’s nuptials.

Actress Jo Joyner made a welcome return to the soap after almost two years away and had her moment of glory when she confronted Abi about her alleged crime.

‘I didn’t, but I wish I had [killed Lucy]’, Abi declared. 

However, Jo unfortunately fluffed one of her live lines earlier on in the episode, mentioning Ian Beale by the actor's real name, Adam [Woodyatt].

She asked, 'How's Adam?', leading to a confused look from her scene partner Laurie Brett [Jane].

Short-lived comeback: Jo Joyner has returned to the soap for two episodes as Tanya Branning

Elsewhere, soap veteran Dot Cotton (June Brown) confessed to a murder of her own.

She went to the hospital to apologise to bed-ridden Ronnie (Samantha Womack) – who has just woken up from her coma – for her son Nasty Nick Cotton (John Altman) putting her there.

But as she was pouring her heart out about leaving drug addict to die, her grandson Charlie (Declan Bennett) entered the room and was stunned to discover the truth about his father’s last days. ‘I’ve killed my son’, the god-faring pensioner admitted.

EastEnders continues on Thursday night, when viewers will finally discover who killed Lucy, and concludes with a fully-live episode on Friday.
