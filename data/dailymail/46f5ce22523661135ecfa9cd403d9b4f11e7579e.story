Customers have complained that billboard for the JC Penny kettle on the 405 Interstate looks like Hitler

Retailer J.C. Penney might have faced the embarrassing task of denying their latest tea kettle was a reference to Hitler, but to compensate, the product sold out in just hours.

After a string of customers complained the Michael Graves Stainless Steel Tea Kettle resembled the World War II dictator, the retailer was forced to deny any intentional link.

But as the kettle became an internet sensation on Monday after appearing on a huge billboard over the 405 Interstate Highway in southern California, it also became a sell-out item, according to The Atlantic.

By the end of Tuesday afternoon, the retailer's website said the product 'was no longer available'.

After saying the resemblance was 'certainly unintended', J.C. Penny told The Daily Telegraph: 'If we'd designed the kettle to look like something, we would've gone with a snowman.'

Commuters driving along the route near 
Culver City found themselves instantly reminded of the Nazi leader Adolf
Hitler when looking up at one of the 31 kettles previously for sale in store.

Several motorists took pictures of the sign, which is around 10 foot tall and 36 foot wide, and posted it on Twitter along with their views about the kettle's resemblance to the former dictator.

Jim @scplanetable tweeted: Every time I see that JC Penny billboard with the teapot, I keep seeing Hitler. Seriously, the thing looks exactly like Hitler. 405 S, man.'

Proving the billboard may not be the best advertising for the retailer, another commuter, Benari @benarilee tweeted: 'Uh, no thanks, JC Penny. I don't think I want your HITLER teapot.'

Other social media users added that they dreaded to think what the store's pressure cookers must look like.
