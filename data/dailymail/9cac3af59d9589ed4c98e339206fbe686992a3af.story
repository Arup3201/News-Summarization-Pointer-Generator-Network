Police in Wall Township, New Jersey have filed juvenile charges against a current sixth grader who allegedly planned a school shooting in the vein of Columbine or Newtown.

As the suspect in question is a minor, police have not released his name.

His plan was uncovered last April when school officials found a note containing violent threats.

The plan: The unidentified suspect was a fifth-grader at Central Elementary School last April when police discovered his plan to carry out a school shooting - and he was suspended

New school: He would have entered the sixth-grade at Wall Intermediate School this fall but is now enrolled in an alternate program as he faces charges for the plan

Police subsequently searched the boys computer and found a more elaborate plan with a detailed 'hit list' of 40 students.

While most of the students on the list were similar in age to him, police aren't sure why any of them were specifically targeted.

Parents of the students on the hit list were informed about the plan in a meeting on September 4.

Investigators said the boy was planning an event 'similar to Columbine or Newtown' but that it wasn't something he was capable of carrying out and merely a 'fantasy'.

Reports have pointed out that a distant family member of the student's owned weapons but didn't have recent contact with the boy.

Modeled after: Police in New Jersey said that he was planning an attack similar to Newtown, above, or Columbine, below

Just a 'fantasy': And while a distant family member did own weapons, officials say that he had no real chance of carrying out the attack

'There was never any real threat to those students,' Wall Township Police Lt John Brockriede told the New York Daily News. 'He wasn't capable of carrying out anything that he put down.'

Though he never carried through on his threats, the police say they have filed juvenile petitions against him.

'As soon as they docket them, they will be able to release them,' Lt Brockriede told the Asbury Park Press. 'Our agencies are confident that our kids are safe, and there is no current threat whatsoever.'

The student - who was a fifth-grader last spring - was promptly suspended from school at Central Elementary School.

He would have started the sixth grade at Wall Intermediate School this fall, but now is enrolled in an alternate program.

School district superintendent Stephanie Bilenker addressed parents Wednesday in a press release.

'The matter is firmly under control by the law enforcement officials no present threat exists,' she said.

She also said that school officials and police 'have already and will be continuing to take additional stps, beyond normal security measures, to ensure the safety of the students involved and every other students in teh school system.'
