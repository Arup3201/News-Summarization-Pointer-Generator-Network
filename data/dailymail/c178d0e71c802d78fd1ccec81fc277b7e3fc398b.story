An former Royal Marine who was struck down by a car and catastrophically injured after dropping his trousers in the middle of the road has won the right to millions in compensation.

Even though Robert Ayres' behaviour had been 'reprehensible' and 'very foolish' a judge ruled that the driver who hit him was 80% to blame for the tragedy that wrecked his life.

Mr Ayres, then aged 24 years, had been out with friends and was in high spirits when he strolled out into the middle of the road and exposed himself to oncoming traffic.

Injured: Former Royal Marine Robert Ayres suffered brain damage when he was hit by a car after he walked into the road with his trousers and underpants pulled down

His girlfriend, Kim Brown tried 
to convince the ex-serviceman to cover up, however Mr Ayres continued to
stand in Horsefair Street, central Leicester with his trousers and 
underpants around his ankles as driver Mahesh Odedra approached.

The
28-year-old freight company worker's Volkswagen Passat struck Mr Ayres,
who hit his head on the kerb as he fell to the ground.

Mr
Ayres, who had served two tours in Iraq with the Royal Marines, 
suffered devastating brain damage in the collision, which occurred 
shortly after midnight on September 27, 2008, and was faced with a 
lifetime of serious disability.

The care he will require for the rest of his life was estimated to cost millions of pounds and many of his friends have organised a series of charity events, including marathon runs and a benefit rugby match, to raise funds for him.

High Court Judge Mrs Justice Swift yesterday guaranteed that 
Mr Ayres would be awarded a huge compensation payout when she ruled 
that Mr Odedra bore the lion's share of blame for the accident.

Rejecting as 'inherently implausible' 
the driver's plea that his car had not even touched Mr Ayres before he 
fell, the judge said that Mr Odedra's initial account to police of a 
crowd of people surrounding him and urinating on his car before the 
accident was 'wholly false'.

Ruling: High Court Judge Mrs Justice Swift guaranteed that Mr Ayres would be awarded compensation for his injuries, despite calling his actions 'foolish'

Mr Ayres 'not acting in a hostile or threatening manner' towards the driver or actively interfering with his car, said the judge.

However, she firmly rejected claims that Mr Odedra had deliberately or recklessly driven into the half naked pedestrian, who at the time was working as a trainee nurse at De Montfort University Hospital, in Leicester.

Finding Mr Odedra 80 per cent to blame, the judge said that he had probably wrongly believed that, by steering slightly to his left, he could avoid Mr Ayres and get safely on his way.

Mrs Justice Swift ruled that Mr Ayres' behaviour, 'whilst reprehensible' and 'very foolish', had not caused the accident.

However, the judge said that he could not be absolved from all responsibility and found him 20 per cent to blame.Â 

He had placed himself in danger by standing, half-clothed, in the middle of the road in front of Mr Odedra's car.

'His drunken state and dropped trousers hampered his ability to move freely and at a normal speed out of the path of the car,' the judge added.

The court's ruling means that Mr Ayres' compensation will now be assessed on the basis of 80 per cent liability.

The amount of his payout will be calculated at a further court hearing, unless final settlement terms are agreed before then.
