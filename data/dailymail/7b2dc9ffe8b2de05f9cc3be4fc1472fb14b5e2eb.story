Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic has been acquitted of one of the two genocide charges he faces at the halfway stage of his long-running showpiece trial.

Judges say prosecutors did not present enough evidence to support the genocide count covering mass killings, expulsions and persecution by Serb forces of Muslims and Croats from Bosnian towns early in the country's 1992-95 war.

However judges refused to dismiss 10 more charges, including a genocide count covering Karadzic's alleged involvement in the 1995 Srebrenica massacre of 8,000 Muslim men. His trial will continue.

The U.N. court's rules allow suspects
to seek acquittal after prosecutors wrap up their case. Earlier this 
month Karadzic asked judges to dismiss all 11 counts against him, saying
prosecutors had failed to prove them.

Last month the showpiece trial was 
dramatically halted in The Hague after an extraordinary and embarrassing
blunder by prosecutors.
