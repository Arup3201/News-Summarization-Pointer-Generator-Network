Representing her nation: Sarah Attar will be the London Games

Saudi Arabia will send two female athletes to the London Olympics, ending the ultraconservative Muslim country's record of sending only all-male teams to the games.

Wodjan Ali Seraj Abdulrahim Shahrkhani will compete in the +78kg judo competition while runner Sarah Attar will be at the start line for the 800m at the Olympic Stadium.

The Gulf kingdom will also include female officials in their Olympic delegation for the first time, one of the officials said.

While in previous Games, men have been able to wear shorts and singlets, the women will almost certainly have to compete with their heads, legs and arms covered - and most likely in leggings.

Speaking from her training base in the US, Sarah Attar said: 'It's such a
 huge honour and I hope that it can really make some big strides for 
women over there to get more involved in sport.'

Competing
 in the Olympics is such a huge step for women in Saudi Arabia, they are
 happy to abide by the strict caveats laid out by their country's 
leaders.

These include 
dressing modestly, being accompanied by a male guardian at all times and
 never mixing with men during the Games, Prince Nawaf bin Faisal told 
the Al-Jazirah newspaper.

Saudi sportswomen may only take part 
if they do so 'wearing suitable clothing that complies with sharia' 
(Islamic law) and 'the athlete's guardian agrees and attends with her', 
he said.

In Saudi Arabia when in public women are required to wear a black abaya and head scarf by law.

They are banned from driving their own cars and they are not permitted to run their own businesses.

Women are also not allowed inside main government buildings.

Travel is very difficult for women in Saudra Arabia.

Regardless of their age, they are not allowed to travel abroad without official permission from their guardians, which has to be authorised by the government.

Two years ago lingerie shops were staffed by men which could prove awkward when women had to discuss underwear sizing with the men.

But it's a year of change and women are now allowed to work in malls as sales clerks in lingerie shops thanks to several campaigns both by officials such as the past labour minister Ghazi Algosaibi and activists such as Reem Asaad. 

'There must also be no mixing with men during the Games,' he added.

'The athlete and her guardian must pledge not to break these conditions,' he said.

It comes after months of talks - with Saudi Olympic chiefs at one point insisting no women would be allowed to take part.

IOC
 president Jacques Rogge described their entry, confirmed by the Saudi 
Arabian Olympic Committee ahead of the July 9 deadline, as 'very 
positive news'.

He said: 
'The IOC has been working very closely with the Saudi Arabian Olympic 
Committee and I am pleased to see that our continued dialogue has come 
to fruition.

'The IOC has 
been striving to ensure a greater gender balance at the Olympic Games, 
and today’s news can be seen as an encouraging evolution.

'With Saudi Arabian female athletes 
now joining their fellow female competitors from Qatar and Brunei 
Darussalam, it means that by London 2012 every National Olympic 
Committee will have sent women to the Olympic Games.'

Qatar
 and Brunei, two other countries that have never sent any female 
athletes to the Olympics, are also including women on their teams for 
the London Games. 

With the Saudis now following suit, 
it means all national teams competing in the games will include female 
athletes for the first time in Olympic history.

About 10,500 athletes are expected to compete in London, representing more than 200 national Olympic committees.

Saudi Arabia has been under pressure 
from the International Olympic Committee and human-rights groups to 
include women athletes.

The IOC has been in negotiations with the Saudis for months on securing the participation of women.

They said the two Saudi athletes were entered by the Saudi Arabian Olympic Committee by the official deadline of July 9.

Rights groups hailed the decision as a
 step forward for Saudi women in their quest for basic rights in a 
country that severely restricts them in public life.

'It's
 an important precedent that will create space for women to get rights 
and it will be hard for Saudi hardliners to roll back,' said Minky 
Worden of the New York-based Human Rights Watch.

Good news: IOC president Jacques Rogge described their entry as 'very positive news'

In the Saudi city of Jeddah, Mariam Alawi, a housewife in her 20s, said: 'This is fantastic news and it's about time. Maybe now people in Saudi can see that females are capable of taking the reins. The world already knows that women can do great things - maybe now Saudi can know that too.'

Hashim Adnan, a 28-year-old Saudi man who works at an investment firm in Jeddah, said the athletes were likely to face "heavy criticism" in the country, but that the government should support them.Saudi King Abdullah has a reputation as a cautious reformer and supporter of women's rights. Last year he announced plans to allow women to vote in municipal council elections and join the consultative Shoura council.

The country's official sports body, the General Presidency of Youth Welfare, only caters to male athletes and women do not take part in sports at state schools. So women athletes have to fund themselves and arrange their own training, mostly abroad.

A Saudi official told Reuters earlier this week Saudi women participating in the Olympics would have to obey the dress code of Islamic law. He did not elaborate, but other conservative Muslim countries have interpreted this to mean a headscarf, long sleeves and long pants.

Saudi Arabia is one of three countries, alongside Brunei and Qatar, never to have sent female athletes to the Olympics but the latter two confirmed earlier this year that their delegations would include women.

Brunei has entered Maziah Mahusin (athletics), while Qatar has entered Nada Arkaji (swimming), Noor Al-Malki (athletics), Aya Magdy (table tennis) and Bahiya Al-Hamad (shooting), who will also be her country's flagbearer at the opening ceremony.
