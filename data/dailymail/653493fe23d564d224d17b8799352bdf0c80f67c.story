Demba Ba was inches away from scoring one of the most audacious goals ever seen in the Champions League - straight from kick-off.

The Besiktas striker saw his ingenious strike hit the Arsenal crossbar in their play-off first leg encounter.

The halfway effort caught out everyone bar Gunners goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny, who managed to react just in time to tip it on to the frame of his goal.

Ba, who joined Besiktas for £4.7million from Chelsea, is looking to impress his new side since leaving west London.

And the Senegal striker nearly did so after six seconds at the Ataturk Stadium with that spectacular strike.

Had it gone in, it would have been the fastest strike ever in the Champions League, beating Roy Makaay's goal for Bayern Munich against Real Madrid in 2007.

The 29-year-old should not be an unknown quantity to Arsene Wenger's side having faced them while playing for West Ham, Newcastle and Chelsea during his time in England.

Ba has already opened his European account for the season, scoring a hat-trick as Besiktas beat Feyenoord 3-1 in their second leg match during their Champions League third qualifying round.
