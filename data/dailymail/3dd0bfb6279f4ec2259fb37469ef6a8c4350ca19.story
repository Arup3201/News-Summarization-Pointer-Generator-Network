Liverpool legend Robbie Fowler has backed Daniel Sturridge to stake his claim as the club's most influential player after the loss of Luis Suarez.

The pair scored 52 goals between them last season as Liverpool came within two points of winning the Premier League title before Suarez was sold to the Barcelona for £75 million.

Despite losing a striker voted as the Player of the Year, Fowler insists the club will move on and Sturridge will emerge from under the Uruguay international's shadow.

Double act: Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge scored 52 league goals between them last season

'He's got that chance now, to go out there and prove to everyone what we already know: that he's a great player,' Fowler told Liverpoolfc.com. 

'We know he's been a shining light since he's been here, but now he's got even more of a chance.' 

The player known as 'God' at Anfield has seen a succession of great forwards arrive and leave Merseyside and Fowler has no doubt that cycle will continue in the wake of Suarez's departure.

'He's a great player, but no-one's bigger than the club and we all know and accept that,' Fowler said.

Living legend: Robbie Fowler has seen great players come and go at Anfield

'We all know he's a phenomenal player, but Liverpool as a club, they just go on. Think of all the players that have gone in the past -- great players -- and they've always adapted and gone on to do well.

'When Ian Rush went, someone came in and done a job -- obviously I came in after Rushie, I forgot about that! I come in and done alright, then Michael [Owen] was there - he was always handy as well; you've got Fernando Torres who was brilliant at Liverpool. He leaves and Suarez comes in and does an unbelievable job.

'Now all of a sudden people are saying 'what will we do?' but Liverpool as a club will always go on. Whatever team Brendan [Rodgers] puts out, they'll all be singing from the same hymn-sheet and wanting to do well.'
