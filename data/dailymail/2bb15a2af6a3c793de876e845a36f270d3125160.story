Charged: Justin Vangilder, 24, has been indicted after three pipe bombs were found in his Illinois home earlier this month

Pipe bombs are improvised explosive devices made by filling a tightly sealed section of pipe with explosive material.

KTVI reported Vangilder had started making two of the three bombs when he was 18.

Authorities were tipped off by Vangilder's colleague at Scott Force Air Base, KSDK reported.

He saw the devices when he visited Vangilder and notified the Office of Special Investigations of the United States Air Force the next day.

The FBI and local law enforcement moved within hours, sending in a bomb squad to disable the devices. Vangilder was also arrested at home. 

Vangilder allegedly told his colleague he was suicidal and had fantasies of killing child molesters.

He had already started collecting detailed personal information and addresses of sex offenders in the area. He also allegedly said he was disappointed at parents for not supporting him during his recent divorce.

Action: Authorities with the FBI, the Illinois State Police Hazardous Device Unit, and the Shiloh Police Department converged on Vangilder's Shiloh home after reports he possessed bombs

Bomb threat: Bomb technicians went inside Vangilder's home, located the devices, and rendered potential explosive devices safe

U.S. Attorney Steve Wigginton said the devices 'were very dangerous and could have caused mass casualties'

According to the criminal complaint, Vangilder's goal was to kill local child molesters and to 'to inflict as many casualties as possible.'

The complaint also states Vangilder waived his right to an attorney and confessed to possessing three pipe bombs.

U.S. Attorney Steve Wigginton said the 'devices were very dangerous and could have caused mass casualties'.

If convicted, the accused faces up to ten years in a federal prison, a $10,000 fine and three years of probation.

Vangilder was a senior airman at Scott AFB, a junior ranking with not more than four years of service.

Officials haven’t said whether he was planning to use the bombs on-base.
