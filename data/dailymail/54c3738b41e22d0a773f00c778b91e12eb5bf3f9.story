Elegant in a floor-length burgundy dress, her blond locks swept off her face into a chic chignon, Princess Charlene of Monaco looked every inch the royal style icon at the opening of an exhibition on Saturday night.

But the South African born royal wasn't the only princess to draw the eye at the Michener Art Museum in Philadelphia, where a new Grace Kelly retrospective opens to the public on Monday.

As she toured the exhibition on the arm of her husband, Prince Albert of Monaco, the princess appeared mesmerised by the photographs and artifacts documenting the life of her late mother-in-law.

And it seems she wasn't the only one, as Prince Albert, who opened the exhibition, also found time to appear in a filmed tribute to his mother which will be shown alongside the rest of the collection.

'I'm deeply touched by your interest in my mother and her rich legacy,' he says in the film. 'Most of the world knows my mother first as a Hollywood film actress, then as the princess of Monaco.

'She was indeed a beautiful and talented woman and a fashion icon but that is just the surface of her life.'

Kelly's only son also spoke of his mother's warm parenting style and revealed that he admired her passion for helping underprivileged children and up-and-coming creative talents.

He said: 'She left a successful Hollywood acting career to pursue her heart. During her lifetime, she became a United Nations advocate for children and an international spokesperson for arts and culture.

'She also established an enduring legacy
as president of the Monaco Red Cross and through the Princess Grace 
Foundation, which is dedicated to identifying and assisting emerging 
talents in theatre, dance and film by awarding grants in the form of 
scholarships, apprenticeships and fellowships.

'Those of us who were fortunate enough to know my mother, her family and friends, knew her to be a genuine, warm and loving woman. A woman who always put her family first.

'I hope that through experiencing this exhibition, you will be able to get a glimpse of the real Grace Kelly, the woman beyond the icon, my mother.'

Kelly, who died at the tragically young age of 52 in a car crash, was born in Philadelphia and lived there until 1947 when she relocated to Manhattan to study at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts.

After graduation and a stint on Broadway, she was signed by MGM studios in Los Angeles and appeared in a string of films including Mogambo and The Country Girl, before retiring from acting at the age of 26 following her marriage to Prince Ranier of Monaco.

The marriage produced three children, Princesses Caroline and Stéphanie and the current ruler of Monaco, Prince Albert.
