David Cameron today prepared to hand over powers which will give 16-year-olds the vote in the Scottish independence referendum.

However, despite the concession to the Nationalists, he vowed to fight to preserve the United Kingdom ‘with everything we’ve got’.

At a meeting on Monday the Prime Minister will agree to Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond’s demands that 16 and 17-year-old Scots should be given a vote on independence.

This will be viewed as a victory for the Scottish National Party, which says a higher proportion of younger voters back its aims. However, this claim was thrown into doubt by a poll for the Mail on Sunday which showed that only 26 per cent of youngsters supported independence, with 59 per cent opposed. 

The Nationalists have lost the fight to have a second, fall-back question which would give them more powers even if they fail to get support for independence. Instead, Scottish voters will face a simple question asking whether they want their country to become independent. In his speech to the Tory conference, Mr Cameron asked: ‘What could matter more than saving our United Kingdom?’

Mr Cameron told activists in Birmingham that the Olympics had highlighted the depth of feeling for the United Kingdom.

‘Whether our athletes were English, Scottish, Welsh or from Northern Ireland, they draped themselves in one flag.

‘Now, there’s one person who didn’t 
like that and he’s called Alex Salmond. I’m going to see him on Monday 
to sort out that referendum on independence by the end of 2014.’

Decision: Under-18s are close to securing a vote in the historic referendum on the United Kingdom's constitution in 2014

He added: ‘Let’s say it: we’re better together and we’ll rise together – and let us fight that referendum with everything we’ve got.’

As part of the deal with the Nationalists, the Scottish Parliament will hold the power over how the referendum is run and who gets a say in it.

A Downing Street source said: ‘It is 
usually for the administration which is running the vote to decide on 
the franchise. We cannot stop them from extending voting rights but the 
Scottish government will have to explain how it will ensure all 16 and 
17-year-olds get on the electoral roll in time. 

‘This is definitely not setting a 
precedent for general or other elections, this is very specific to the 
independence referendum.’ 

Polls have shown that most young 
people oppose the break-up of Britain. Government sources said this was 
because they were ‘more internationalist’.

'Personal issue': Education Secretary Michael Gove, who is Scottish, said lots of UK ministers will be taking part in the campaign

Mr Salmond said: ‘I’m certainly 
hoping and optimistic that a deal can be done next week. There are a 
number of issues that are still to be resolved.’ 

Education Secretary Michael Gove, who
is Scottish, said: ‘There will be lots of UK ministers taking part in 
the campaign. For myself, because my family live in Scotland, I don’t 
want to be in a situation where I’m part of a government that sees that 
my mum and dad become foreigners. For me, it’s an emotional and personal
issue.’ 

The elderly could have to wait years 
before the introduction of a system to prevent them having to sell their
homes to pay for care, Jeremy Hunt admitted.

Currently at least 20,000 pensioners 
are forced to sell their home every year – denying their children an 
inheritance. Older people were promised two years ago that a new system 
would be in place by 2015.

However, the Health Secretary’s 
comments appear to contradict Mr Cameron’s pledge in the summer to find 
the money to cap the lifetime costs of long-term care for the elderly at
£35,000.

At a fringe event at the Tory 
conference, Mr Hunt said, although he wanted to impose a cap, it may 
have to be set at a higher level to make it more affordable. Money could
also be saved by restricting pensioners’ eligibility for assistance, he
said.

Last year, economist Andrew Dilnot 
recommended a cap on total lifetime costs, with the Government stepping 
in to pay the rest. The economist put the cost of this at £1.7billion a 
year. 

The Health Secretary said: ‘It may be
that the right solution takes us a period of years to get to. This is 
something that is potentially very expensive.’
