Britain's first motorway pub is set to open, serving alcohol from 8am.

JD Wetherspoon has been granted a licence in a move that drew condemnation last night from road safety and alcohol awareness campaigners.

They say the proposal is 'a backwards step' that sends out 'completely the wrong message' about drinking and driving.

The branch of Wetherspoon is planned for the main building at Beaconsfield service station on the M40

Wetherspoon plans to open the pub at 
the Extra service area on the M40 near junction two at Beaconsfield, 
Buckinghamshire, later this year – with more to follow at other Extra 
sites.

The pub chain said bar staff will 
trust customers to know whether they should be drinking or not and does 
not plan to quiz people asking for a pint of beer or glass of wine.

It follows a move by the Home Office to relax the law that bans the sale of alcohol at motorway service stations.

As a result, a growing number now sell drink through retail partners such as Marks & Spencer.

And two weeks ago, Harvester opened 
its first motorway restaurant – selling alcohol – at Moto services on 
the M1 at Donington Park in Leicestershire.

It is part of a six-month trial but 
more Harvesters are expected to open at other Moto sites. Alcohol 
Concern chief executive Eric Appleby warned: 'Selling alcohol on our 
motorways sends all the wrong signals to drivers, it just sounds like 
profits being put before sense.

Wetherspoon: has been given permission for a £2million licensed bar and restaurant on the M40 at Beaconsfield, Bucks

'Campaigners have worked tirelessly to
 improve road safety in the UK and persuade people that drinking and 
driving don't mix and this feels like a backwards step.'

Carol Whittingham, the founder of 
Campaign Against Drink Driving, said: 'I'm absolutely astounded they 
have got permission for this.

'People will be tempted to drink and 
drive and I can't understand how the local authority has allowed this. 
It is just not necessary – you can buy alcohol on every street corner so
 why tempt people by having it at motorways as well?

Sir Ian Gilmore, chairman of the 
Alcohol Health Alliance, said: 'To reduce alcohol-related harm, we have 
to reduce its availability, not increase it. Opening a bar at a service 
station sends out completely the wrong message if we are trying to 
prevent harm from alcohol-related traffic accidents.'

Drink-driving resulted in 9,990 
casualties, including 280 deaths, on British roads in 2011, with 42 per 
cent of all road deaths linked to drinking.

But Wetherspoon insists that neither 
Thames Valley Police nor South Bucks district council raised any 
objection to its licence application for the first fully-fledged pub to 
be opened specifically to serve motorway traffic.

The Conservative-run council said the 
licence was granted last week following the statutory 28-day public 
consultation during which no objections were lodged.

It insisted the M40 site is not 
directly on the motorway – drivers have to take a slip road to reach it.
 Wetherspoon and Extra are investing more than £2million on the M40 
development, which will create 50 jobs. It will open 24 hours a day for 
food, coffee and soft drinks, and serve alcohol from 8am to 1am.

JD Wetherspoon chairman Tim Martin 
said: 'The company has always been innovative and this is an exciting 
new development for us. Hopefully it will be the first of many.'

Asked about the risk that it will 
encourage people to drink-drive, a Wetherspoon spokesman said: 'We think
 the majority of people who want a drink will be coach parties with a 
driver who is not drinking.

'If an individual comes in and orders a
 whisky or pint of beer, we are not going to ask whether they are 
driving. You wouldn't do that in a village pub and we won't be doing 
that here. We expect people to act responsibility. We don't see this as 
any different to a pub that you may drive to that is just off the 
motorway network.'

Extra chief executive Andrew Long said the motorway pub would 'improve customer choice'.

Until recently, the sale of alcohol at motorway service station outlets was banned.

However, this has been relaxed over the past 18 months.

A proposal to remove controls has been
 outlined by the Home Office in its Alcohol Strategy, which is designed 
to reduce the red tape surrounding drink licensing.
