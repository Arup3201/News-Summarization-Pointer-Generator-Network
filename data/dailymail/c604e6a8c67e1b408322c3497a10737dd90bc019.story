PC Stephen Hudson was given a nine month suspended sentence after he was found guilty of misconduct in a public office

This is the moment a police officer lost both his unblemished career and his reputation by  losing his temper with a disruptive teenage tearaway.

PC Stephen Hudson bent the 15-year-old boy’s arm behind his back and lifted him off the ground after he refused to empty his pockets.

CCTV captured the 6ft 1in officer – who in a 12-year career suffered injuries including a suspected fractured skull, cracked rib and broken finger while tackling criminals – slam the 4ft 8in  boy on to the counter, causing him to scream in pain.

The 43-year-old then pushed his face against the teenager’s ear and shouted: ‘You are not the big man. You might think you are but you’re not.’

However the divorced father-of-three was himself arrested after the boy – described in court as a ‘local nuisance’ who had repeatedly tried officers’ patience – complained of bruising and a nosebleed.

Hudson claimed to have been using an authorised police restraint technique called ‘pain compliance’ and said he himself had been assaulted by the youth.

The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had been arrested for a breach of bail.

He had been in the custody suite at Swinton police station in Greater Manchester ‘numerous times’ before and had previously kicked cell doors and refused to obey the rules, a court heard.

The jury heard he went 'over the top' when the boy refused to empty his pockets

He pulled the 15-year-old boy's arms behind his back three times and held him against the counter

However a jury at Bolton Crown Court found the former officer, who worked at the suite, guilty of misconduct in a public office.

Hudson, who has quit his job, was given a nine-month jail term suspended for 18 months.

The court heard he had been left ‘a 
broken man’ facing bankruptcy, while his children had to be taken out of
school as a result of bullying over the incident.

During the incident the teenager was lifted off his feet when Hudson took hold of him

Hudson has now quit his role as police constable after 12 years service after he grabbed the boy

The 15-year-old boy was so distressed he was left with a bleeding nose and bruised chest

In addition, he faces being sued by the boy’s family.

But Judge Peter Davies accused 
Hudson, of Westhoughton, near Bolton, of ‘besmirching’ the reputation of
a force which last  month lost two female officers in a shooting by 
inflicting ‘deliberate degradation and humiliation’ on the teenager.

And he branded the laughter of three 
other watching officers, including a sergeant, ‘bullying of the worst 
form’ and said they  ought to have been in the dock alongside Hudson.

The two PCs and a custody  sergeant are now facing disciplinary action.

Judge Davies declared: ‘The 
overwhelming majority of police officers discharge the faith and trust 
invested in them by the public with diligence, courage and fortitude.

‘A tiny few, however, betray that trust, and I am afraid you have been found to be one of those few.’

Hudson said no one questioned his actions at the time and he had not made a complaint of assault himself despite being kicked by the youth

PC Hudson, who has been attacked while on duty, is 'likely to be left bankrupt' and is a 'broken man'

Iain Simkin, prosecuting, said Hudson
had used ‘far more force than proportional or reasonable’ against a boy
who was simply  being ‘cheeky’. Hudson said he had acted in accordance 
with his  police training, saying: ‘I was frustrated and a bit angry 
that he wouldn’t comply.

‘I was trying to do a legitimate search and he just wasn’t doing what he was told.

‘I didn’t lose my temper. I was just being assertive.’

The boy’s mother said: ‘That man should never have been called a police officer. He abused my son at the end of the day.’

Detective Chief Superintendent Paul 
Rumney, from Greater Manchester Police, said: ‘PC Hudson overstepped the
boundaries of reasonable force and acted instead with excessive force.’

‘His actions were totally unacceptable,’ he added.
