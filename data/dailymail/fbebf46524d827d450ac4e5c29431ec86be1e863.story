Crime has fallen to its lowest level since records began more than 30 years ago, official figures revealed today.

There were about 8.5 million crimes last year, down 7 per cent despite cuts to police budgets.

But there was a nine per cent rise in reports of sexual offences, in part blamed on the inquiry into abusers like Jimmy Savile encouraging victims to come forward.

Record low: The number of crimes reported to the annual survey in England and Wales fell seven per cent to 8.5million in the year to June

Based on the Crime Survey for England and Wales there were just over 8.5million crime in the year to June 2013, down from 9.1 million on the previous 12 months.

It means the headline crime figure is the lowest since the survey began in 1981, and is now less than half its peak level in 1995.

Of crimes actually recorded by the police after complaints from the public, there were 3.7 million offences in the year to June, a decrease of five per cent compared with the previous year.

Crime prevention minister Norman Baker said: ‘Police reform is working and crime is falling.

‘Recorded crime has dropped yet again, by more than 10 per cent under the coalition Government, and the crime survey says that crime has more than halved since its peak in 1995.

‘This is really positive news. Forces are rising to the challenge of making savings whilst cutting crime and delivering a better service to the public.'

Beat: Police have seen falls in violent crime and robberies but the number of reports of sexual offences has risen

He went on: 'England and Wales are safer than they
have been for decades but we will continue to deliver measures which 
keep pace with the changing nature of crime and improve our ability to 
combat emerging issues.’

The rise in reports of sexual 
offences was put partly down to greater numbers coming forward to report
historical sexual offences to the police.

Cuts: Home Office minister Norman Baker said the falls i crime had been achieved at a time when police budgets were squeezed

The ONS said: ‘There is evidence to 
suggest that these increases are partly a result of the Operation 
Yewtree investigation, initiated in October 2012 and connected to the 
Jimmy Savile inquiry.

‘Whilst some of these increases will 
be a direct consequence of the crimes reported as part of Operation 
Yewtree there is also evidence to suggest that there has been a wider 
“Yewtree effect”1 whereby there is increased willingness on the part of 
the victims to come forward and report historical sexual offences that 
are not directly connected to Yewtree.

‘Additionally the publicity surrounding Operation Yewtree may have encouraged more victims to come forward and report more recent abuse cases.’

There was also a 21 per cent rise in fraud offences recorded. The ONS said the figures should be viewed in the context of a move towards the centralised recording of fraud by police.

There were also increases in theft from the person, which was up eight per cent, and shoplifting, up 1 per cent.

Max Chambers, head of Crime and Justice, at the think-tank Policy Exchange, said: ‘Whether you believe it’s as the result of an ageing population, better policing and prevention, or the impact of the internet, there is little doubt that Britain is becoming a safer place to live, do business and raise a family.

‘But crime is still too high and there are pockets of the country which remain blighted by anti-social behaviour and gang activity.

‘While the latest figures show that the police have been able to cut crime substantially even with fewer resources, they must now redouble their efforts to tackle the hardcore of prolific offenders who commit offences that can often disproportionately hit the poor and the vulnerable.’
