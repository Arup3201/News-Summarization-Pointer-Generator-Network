I’ve always loved an adventure, be it back-packing around Iceland when I was six, exploring the Valley of the Kings, or walking through rainforest to reach Mayan temples.

Exploring the world and experiencing new things makes me feel alive. Space would be the ultimate adventure - a chance to look back on our fragile planet and be part of the next phase of explorers. 

Many children dream of being astronauts, but the reality of space seems so far away. They get written off as dreamers, but what’s wrong with aiming for the stars?

You might think that I’m crazy for trying to get to space, but if I make it a reality I’m really excited about sharing the adventure with others.

If you’d told me three years ago that I would see shuttles launch, meet rocket scientists and have a friend in space I would thought you were crazy, but all those things have happened – so why not space? Hopefully my enthusiasm will encourage more people to dream.

Space is starting to open up to more people. Companies such as Virgin Galactic and XCOR offering tourist flights are just the start.

Astronauts I’ve spoken to are keen that more people should share their unique view of the planet.

They are using social media to share their time in space, and current International Space Station Commander Chris Hadfield has sent down a plethora of awe-inspiring images from on high. 

The space sector has come a long way from its beginnings where only macho male military pilots had the chance to be astronauts, so it’s such a shame that Lynx campaign has seemingly ignored this progress. 

Is the ad sexist? According to Kate, the galactic Lynx campaign most certainly is

Ready for lift off! Despite the sexism, Kate is still entering the contest and hopes to see Earth from above

Their adverts, encouraging people to apply for the Lynx Space Academy, portray women as poor helpless girls that have to be rescued by hunky firemen or lifeguards - not even polite enough to thank their rescuers before ditching them for a male astronaut.

The campaign slogan 'Leave a man, return a hero' begs the question 'which man shall I leave?'.

'But the product is aimed at men' I hear you cry. Well I’m not stupid. I know that it’s a male brand. I know that Lynx adverts have always used sex to sell their products.

It’s not that that I take issue with. It’s the fact that the adverts promote outdated stereotype that space is just for men, so much so that several in several countries Axe/Lynx refused to allow female entrants to the competition when it began.

Research has shown that enduring cultural stereotypes about women’s abilities in scientific fields have real-world effects on their success in the lab.

This international, multimillion pound campaign reinforces those stereotypes and may put off the next generation of female scientists. I think it’s really damaging and I want to highlight the fact that there are many amazing women who also work in space.

If I won a chance to go to space I would not be able to contain my excitement and nor would I want to. Space is exciting. Space is dangerous, and amazing, and flashy, and sexy.

Plan B: If Lynx doesn't work out, Kate hopes to go into space with Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic

We need to encourage more people to study science and engineering and remember what it was about space that made us dream of being astronauts when we were younger.

Too often scientists are caricatured as boffins, geeks and nerds, but at the heart of it is a desire to explore and understand. To be excited by the world around us.

I would love to be able to share the experience and excitement with others and perhaps make Lynx think about the way they portray women in the future.

NASA has worked hard to encourage more women into science and engineering. A good friend of mine who got a long way through NASA’s astronaut selection process (for which I sadly lack the US citizenship), sums up the importance of this work: 'It is precisely because NASA has worked so hard to distance itself from its overly masculine past that I felt I had a chance in the first place.'

She continues 'I fear Axe/Lynx’s Apollo campaign tarnishes the image of all human spaceflight endeavours, not just their own, and therefore may ultimately discourage young women from imagining they might one day become an astronaut'.

That is exactly the sort of thing that I’m fighting against, and if I can get somewhere in this male-oriented competition, maybe that will help others dare to dream.

Not only was Sheffield's Helen Sharman the first British woman in space, she was the first Briton full stop.

Her unusual career began in 1989, after she responded to a radio ad for would-be astronauts - and beat 13,000 other hopefuls to take her place on board a Russian space shuttle.

After 18 months of intensive training at the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Russia's 'Star City', Sharman was blasted into space on the Soyuz TM-12 mission in 1991.

Just 27 years old, she was the fifth youngest person ever to blast into space.

Fellow travellers included the Soviet cosmonauts Anatoly Artsebarsky and Sergei Krikalev, and most of the eight day trip was spent on the Russian space station, Mir.

Now a broadcaster and science lecturer, Sharman has never returned to space, although she was one of the UK's three candidates for the1992 European Space Agency astronaut selection process and was on the shortlist of 25 applicants in 1998.
