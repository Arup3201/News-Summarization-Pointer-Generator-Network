It provides a vital service to the vulnerable. But  that didn’t save this meals-on-wheels van from being targeted by clampers.

Their action – outside a sheltered housing block – delayed deliveries to some patients who have to have their food at set times with medication. Mark Baker, of meals provider Agincare, said Patrol Plus had demanded £125 to remove the clamp.

Neighbours claimed the company had previously targeted other carers at the block in Poole, Dorset. After a heated discussion the clampers released the van free of charge.

Neighbour Rob McDonald was so appalled by the situation he took photographs of the van with the yellow clamp on its front off-side wheel.

Mr McDonald, 62, added: 'I thought it was ridiculously over-zealous by this clamper to do what he did.

'Ironically, we held a residents association meeting just the day before it happened and voted to have this clamping company thrown off the site.

'We have had a series of people, mainly carers visiting in the mornings and evenings who earn not much more than minimum wage and do a job that many of us would not want to do.'

Mark Baker, of meals-on-wheels firm Agincare home cuisine, said: 'I had this guy on the phone demanding £125 for the vehicle's release so the driver could complete their rounds.

'I wanted to make sure he fully understood he was holding up the meals for vulnerable adults in the community.

'Some of these people have dementia, some have diabetes and need to have food with their medication at specific times. This could have proved detrimental to their health.'

Mr Baker said he believed it was the pressure from angry neighbours which forced the firm into a U-turn.

The housing development is operated by Synergy Housing which made no comment on the clamping incident.

A spokesman for Patrol Plus claimed that staff from Agincare were choosing to park on yellow lines outside the building rather than park in the designated two-hour parking bays.
