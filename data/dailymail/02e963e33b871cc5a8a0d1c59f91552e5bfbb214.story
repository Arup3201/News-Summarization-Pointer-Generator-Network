Whether you're seething with envy because you didn't get a ticket, giddy with delight that you won't be trudging around a farm all weekend, or simply don't care either way, it's impossible to forget about a certain little music festival going on in Somerset this weekend.

But those suffering the dreaded Glastenvy can console themselves with the thought of how much cash they'll be saving by not hanging out with the likes of the Rolling Stones and the Arctic Monkeys at Glastonbury.

Because before you've even factored in the £210 ticket price, transport costs, sleeping bags - plus the all-important cold cider and hot food money once you're actually at the event - every attendee is likely to spend an average of £200 on festival essentials before they set off. And it's mostly alcohol and fancy dress for the boys, wet wipes and wellies for the girls.

It's Glastonbury this weekend, if you hadn't already noticed, and attendees will be packing their bags with over £200 worth of stuff before they even arrive in Somerset, according to new research into festival spending

While the girls grab wet wipes, loo roll, wellies and anti-bacterial hand gel, for the boys, alcohol and fancy dress came top of the list of things to pack for a festival

It seems men pack 'to have a good time' (58 per cent) and women pack 'to be comfortable' (61 per cent) when it comes to attending festivals, according to a new survey.

And in terms of what to bring, the essential items found in the backpacks of girls and boys also varies wildly.

Alcohol, funny fancy dress, snacks and sex protection came top of the men's 'to buy' lists... while wet wipes, dry shampoo, wellies and anti-bacterial hand gel were the priorities for women.

Further ingredients for making a festival complete for male fans are drinking games, outdoor games such as footballs, paracetamol and water.

Women, on the other hand, also chose toilet roll, perfume, umbrellas, mirrors, sun lotion and waterproofs.

Festival-goers spend £200 each on packing essentials

Anti-bacterial hand gel is crucial to the girls

Women don't like to go without their own loo roll

Attending Glastonbury is no longer a case of hopping over the fence with nothing but the clothes you're wearing and a fiver - these days festival fans arrive laden with alcohol, camping gear, stoves, bicycles, umbrellas and five days-worth of fancy dress

In effort to save money while on site, many people resort to bringing in stashes of alcohol to last them five days, left, and energy drinks to keep them going for the whole festival, right

Respondents were asked how much they spent on items to take along with them, including a tent, and the average festival spend was £230 per person.

Ennis Al-Saiegh, marketing director at offeroftheday.co.uk who conducted the research, said: 'It seems that men and women have different views on what's essential when it comes to festival camping.

'Women seem to make the sensible stuff as a priority, but men appear to focus on the good times!'

'It would suggest that there's more of a cavalier attitude amongst the men surveyed. Maybe it's pre-festival exuberance or post-festival nostalgia, but it would be interesting to see if the list changes two days in!

Got Glastenvy? Try not to think about the music and the laughter, and instead focus on the money you'll be saving (we know, we know, it's hard)
