Phil Taylor's preparation for the William Hill World Darts Championship has been seriously overshadowed by the illness to his mother, who he admits is close to death.

Late on Monday night the 16-time world champion rushed to the bedside of his 74-year-old mother, Liz, who has a severe lung infection.

‘I thought it was over the other night to be honest,’ Taylor revealed. ‘It will be touch-and-go, I think, in the next couple of weeks.’

His mother’s condition is so bad that she has often struggled to recognise her son, or other members of the family, when they have visited her at the Staffordshire hospital where she has spent the past month.

‘She is losing her memory now,’ said 54-year-old Taylor. ‘One minute she will know you, the next thing she won’t know who you are. She will think you are Tommy Steele. Or Edward VIII one minute. It’s awful, like. It’s life unfortunately. It’s heart-breaking.

‘It’s worse for the kids because my mum is like their mum, if you know what I mean. She is the guru.

‘She is still there. It’s a good job I haven’t got an insurance policy on her, I tell her. “Come on you hurry up”. I said that to her the other day. I said: “I have got a £2million policy on you. Hurry up will you”. She laughed at that.’

Taylor’s father, Doug, died of prostate cancer 17 years ago and his mother, who the family call their ‘Yoda’, has been the hub of the family. He fears Liz may not make it through to the start of the World Championship on December 18.

But Taylor, who will look to extend his record 16 world titles and win the trophy back from Dutchman Michael van Gerwen, has found solace in his sport during this difficult time.

‘You know what, darts has been like escapism for me,’ he added. ‘It has. It takes your mind off it for those days you are in a tournament. My mum is ill now — she won’t get better. That’s it now. She will only gradually get worse.

‘It’s just a matter of when, now. If you are out there competing, you are not thinking about the situation at home.’

Sky Sports will show the William Hill World Darts Championship exclusively live on the Sky Sports Darts channel starting Thursday, December 18.
