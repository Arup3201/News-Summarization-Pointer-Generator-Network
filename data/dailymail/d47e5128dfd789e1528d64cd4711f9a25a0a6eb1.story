Two Britons are among 20 journalists arrested in Egypt while working for TV news channel Al Jazeera, the authorities have claimed.

Egypt’s prosecutor’s office said yesterday an Australian, a Dutch citizen and the two from the UK are accused of helping to promote false news benefiting the Muslim Brotherhood.

The Brotherhood, which was in power until Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi was forced from power by the army last year, has since been declared a terrorist group.

Mohammed Badr, a cameraman for Al-Jazeera, appears at a court in Cairo, Egypt, on charges of joining or assisting a terrorist group and spreading false news that endangers national security

Prosecutors also claim that 16 Egyptian Al Jazeera workers are accused of joining the group.

Al Jazeera said it was only aware of five employees who have been arrested.

The Foreign Office said it was aware of the reports and investigating, but was unable to confirm the arrest of Britons.

Among those previously known to have been arrested is Australian Peter Greste who was detained a month ago.

Others are Al Jazeera Cairo bureau chief Mohammed Fahmy, who is Egyptian-Canadian, and Egyptian producer Baher Mohamed.

The Britons who are said to have been arrested have not been identified.

If found guilty at a trial, those arrested could face sentences ranging from three years for spreading false news to 15 for belonging to a terrorist group.

Prosecutors allege that the 20 journalists set up a media center for the Brotherhood in two suites in a luxury hotel.

Analysts said the move showed the government was expanding its crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood but was also designed to send a message to countries hostile to the current regime.

Al Jazeera is controlled by the Emir of Qatar’s cousin.

Qatar has stated its unhappiness at the methods used by Egypt to crush dissent, having previously backed Islamist movements across the Middle East.
