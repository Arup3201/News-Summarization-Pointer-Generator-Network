Dozens have been killed and wounded in an attack by Islamist extremists in norteastern Nigeria, military sources say.

Boko Haram insurgents attacked Maiduguri, the biggest city in northeast Nigeria, home to more than 1million people, just after midnight on Sunday.

Government troops are now blocking roads to and from the city, putting several hundred thousand civilians 'at grave risk', Amnesty International says.

A video of Boko Haram leader  Abubakar Shekau was posted on YouTube just days before the Islamist group attacked Maiduguri, the biggest city in northeast Nigeria, just after midnight on Sunday

An officer involved in the fighting, said the extremists attacked on three fronts around Maiduguri early Sunday and dozens of fighters have been killed.

Military spokesman Chris Olukolade tweeted that 'coordinated air and land operations are being conducted now.'

Maiduguri has been attacked many times in Nigeria's five-year Islamic insurgency that killed 10,000 people last year.

Just hours after the attack on Maiduguri, another town in the state, Monguno, came under fire from Boko Haram militants.

Maiduguri is the capital of Borno state and would be a major prize for the Sunni jihadist group, which has killed thousands during their five-year insurgency to carve out an Islamic state in the northeast of Africa's most populous country.

The army's inability to quash the group is a major headache
for President Goodluck Jonathan, who is seeking re-election in
February and who visited Maiduguri on Saturday as part
of his campaign. Opposition candidate Muhammadu Buhari had been
due to arrive on Monday.

 The militants control vast swathes of Borno state and some
areas of neighbouring Adamawa and Yobe states, and recently took
control of the town and a multi-national army base at Baga by
Lake Chad.

The government said 150 people had been killed in that
attack but local officials say the figure is far higher and some
have put it as high as 2,000.

Monguno is about 138 kilometres (miles) north of Maiduguri, and just over 50 kilometres from Baga. 

Security sources
said the attack there began on Sunday morning and that the
military was being overwhelmed by Boko Haram's firepower. Houses
in the town were also being set on fire.

'Boko Haram has more power than us and are shelling the town
... our colleagues are fleeing,' a soldier in Maiduguri said
after speaking to friends fighting the insurgents in Monguno.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is due to arrive in
commercial capital Lagos, in the southwest of country, later on
Sunday. Nigeria is Africa's biggest economy.

Boko Haram last attempted to take Maiduguri from the same
area in December 2013, attacking a nearby army and airforce base
which is also the area's civilian airport.

Security sources said the militants tried to take the
airport again during the latest attack but were repelled to
about 350 metres away.

A resident, Rachel Adamu, who lives around Njimtilo said
'please pray for us, we are in danger, under serious attack
now.'
