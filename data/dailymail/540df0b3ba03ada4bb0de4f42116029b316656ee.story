NICO ROSBERG COLUMN: Melbourne won't be stroll in Albert Park that Red Bull say it will... and I am relishing being one of title favourites

Lewis Hamilton cemented his status as favourite for the Formula One title after posting the fastest time in practice at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix. 

The 2008 world champion led a Mercedes 1-2 with Nico Rosberg two tenths adrift of his team-mate.

Hamilton's success in the day's second session at Albert Park came in stark contrast to the morning where he failed to complete one lap due to an oil problem which saw him stop on track.

On song: Lewis Hamilton posted the fastest time in second practice after a troubled start to the day

Confrontation: Hamilton is quizzed by an over-zealous security guard as he makes his way back to the paddock

Going through: Hamilton responds to the security guard's question by informing him he is a driver

As Hamilton's Mercedes was craned back to the garage, the British driver was then involved in an 
altercation with a security guard en route back to the pits where he was 
asked to present his paddock pass despite being dressed in his Mercedes overalls, and wearing his helmet.

The
 over-zealous security guard attempted to put his arm across the 29-year-old asking: 'Have you got a pass'? To which Hamilton maneuvered his way past and
 said: 'I'm a driver!'

The 
Ferrari of Fernando Alonso, who was fastest in the opening session, 
posted the third quickest lap in the afternoon. Despite their pre-season
 troubles, Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel was fourth, with McLaren's Jenson
 Button fifth quickest. 

Despite his chaotic day, Hamilton was pleased with his progress.

'I think we basically got a massive foundation in FP2 and I can build on that in FP3 and then see where we end up in qualifying,' said Hamilton.

'It would have been great to have had FP1 but I got enough running thankfully in FP2 so I feel quite comfortable with the car.

'I felt I was really on the back foot already. But I got up to the pace quite quickly and found a balance relatively fast as well so I'm positive.'

Issues: Hamilton's Mercedes is craned away after he stopped on track inside five minutes of the first session

Cnetre of attention: Fans flock to take pictures of the British racer after his Mercedes ground to a halt on Friday

Vettel
 completed a session-high 40 laps, a triumph of sorts given Red Bull 
were one of the teams worst affected by testing gremlins throughout the winter.

The
 reigning four-time champion sat out the opening 50 minutes of  the 
morning session as his engineers changed the floor on his seemingly 
troublesome car, yet come the end of the day Vettel was 0.756secs adrift
 of Hamilton, with new team-mate Daniel Ricciardo in close attendance in
 seventh.

Surprisingly, 
Williams pairing Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa were eighth and 12th 
respectively, despite their pre-season standing as second favourites for
 the constructors' crown.

In trouble: Hamilton parked his Mercedes after failing to complete a lap in the day's opening practice session

Although
 the sessions were not as chaos-strewn as perhaps had been anticipated, 
there are two teams in serious trouble - Caterham and Lotus.

The
 two Renault customers managed a combined total of just 17 laps across 
the four cars. Hardest hit was Caterham's Kamui Kobayashi who completed a
 solitary installation lap in the morning, only to encounter a fuel 
system issue that kept his car in the garage for the entire day.

Rookie team-mate Marcus Ericsson suffered electrical problems, with the Swede only managing one lap per session.

On track: Nico Rosberg ended the day with the second fastest time as Jenson Button takes to the circuit

On the slide: Despite this off-track incident, Sebastian Vettel enjoyed a promising day at the office

Lotus'
 Pastor Maldonado did not take part in FP2 after ending first practice 
with wisps of smoke floating from the cockpit of his car on only his 
second lap.

Team-mate 
Romain Grosjean sat in the garage for the whole of FP1 and although he 
made it on track in FP2 for 12 laps, he ended it in the gravel after a 
brush with a wall.

Of those
 that did complete a time, Marussia's Max Chilton was slowest, five 
seconds down on Hamilton, although he at least ran for 29 laps after 
only completing four in FP1.

Lighting up the timesheets: Hamilton was two tenths clear of team-mate Rosberg in the second session
