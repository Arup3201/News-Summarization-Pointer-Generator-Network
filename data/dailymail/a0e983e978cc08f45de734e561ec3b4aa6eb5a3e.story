Pampered and preened, with curlers in their hair and stylists giving each of them a last trim before showtime, this could be backstage at a fashion show or a celebrity gala.

Instead, this is day three of Crufts 2014, where the great, the good, and the downright bizarre of the canine world gather to indulge their passion for pets.

From poodles with pigtails, to a pomeranian in a pram, day three of the event at the NEC arena in Birmingham has already seen some incredible sights.

Pampered: With pigtails in their hair and a dedicated owner giving a final haircut and applying hairspray, these two poodles are given celebrity-style treatment

Perfect: With their gleaming white fur, dainty bows and sparkling eyes, these two Maltese dogs America (left) and Raphael are sure to impress

Grumpy: As Carter the Bichon Frise has his Afro trimmed on the third day of the show, he looks a little less than impressed with the attention he's getting

Crufts, which started in the Victorian era in 1891, is said to be the largest event of its kind anywhere in the world and attracts the beautiful and the bizarre

Pram: Rather than risk spoiling the coats on these dogs on the way in, their owners have instead opted to put them in specially designed baby buggies

Ready for a closeup: This Shih Tzu waits patiently while his owner styles his hair ready for his time to shine and a chance to be named Best In Show

Today it is the turn of the Toy group of dogs to take centre stage, with breeds such as Chihuahuas, Shih Tzus and Yorkshire Terriers all on display.

The day's events will also feature Utility dogs - breeds which don't fit into any other category or whose original use has become redundant.

The four-day event is the world's largest dog show, and today features competitions from 9am until 5.15pm. Categories include agility, freestyle and heelwork to music. There will also be various displays from groups including the the West Midlands Police and the East Anglian Staffordshire Bull Terriers.

How do I look?: A Yorkshire Terrier, part of the Toy dog category, has its fur styled ready for an appearance on the big stage

Today it is the turn of the Toy and Utility dogs to take centre stage, with the Gundogs to follow on the final day tomorrow

Does this fur make me look fat? This tiny canine is all puffed out after an extensive styling session by his owners at the NEC arena

Cheer up!: All the waiting around seems to have got the better of this poor pooch who looks thoroughly fed up

Thirsty work: This pampered pet proves that its not easy being beautiful as he takes a quick drinks break

Patience: The dog will compete in events such as the Obedience category, which sees them follow on their owners heels and lie down for two minutes

Thursday saw the Working and Pastrol dogs strut their stuff, yesterday featured the Terrier and Hound categories and tomorrow will mark the finale of the competition with the Gundogs - featuring breeds such as Labrador Retrievers, Irish Setters and Springer Spaniels.

There are also a number of events solely for children and their dogs

It has changed in ways that couldnâ€™t possibly have been imagined when the show was set up in Victorian times by the late Charles Cruft. Although it was a very different event in 1891 Charles Cruft was a great showman and would surely have enjoyed the size and scope of the event today, which is an essential date in any dog loverâ€™s calendar.

Star quality: The dogs get celebrity treatment for the day, and also celebrity attention, as Ulrika Jonsson arrived to give bulldogs Mable and Ted a hug

Flying the flag: If the judges were giving out points for patriotism then this British bulldog would surely walk away with first prize

Ab fab: This tiny chihuahua, called Queenie, is the centre of attention as she arrives with owners Kelly Pearce (left) and Josie Carter

A whole lotta love: The gaze on this man's face shows nothing but love for his two chihuahuas as he sits with them during Crufts

Dog tired: Spending the whole day as the centre of attention and having your hair done can be exhausting, as this Yorkshire terrier seems to be finding out

Upstaged: While the attention is supposed to be on the dogs, this flamboyant owner manages to upstage her poodle with her pink hair, suede and trainers combo

Bad hair day?: Caught halfway through preparations for the show this dog makes for quite a striking sight but will hopefully have the mop-top under control soon

The dog show is still an important part of the event, celebrating the unique relationship that dogs share with their owners. Judges are trained to ensure that only healthy dogs win prizes, which in turn encourages the breeding of healthy dogs. But the event is now about so much more besides.

Crufts is ultimately a celebration of all dogs. It celebrates working dogs, such as those in the Gamekeeper classes or which line up for the Police Dog Team Operational and Humanitarian Action of the Year award.

It hails hero dogs through the Friends for Life competition. Rescue dogs are celebrated in the rescue dog agility competition and the speed and agility of dogs is celebrated in the ever popular competitions of Flyball and Heelwork to Music.

International: Dog owners travel from across the globe to take part in the four-day extravaganza including Laura Donzelli (left), Claudia Madel (centre), and Clara Valtulini (right) from Italy

Picture perfect: This pair of pomeranians, DD and Daisy, have travelled with their owner Sylvia Pope from Shropshire for the day

Nearly ready: After hours of preparation these Yorkshire terriers have the final touches applied to their immaculate hair

For prospective dog owners and dog lovers, Crufts is a prime opportunity to talk to Kennel Club Assured Breeders, rescue charities and breed experts about how to responsibly buy, train and enjoy life with your dog.

The dogs compete in various events to test their obedience and agility in order to be named Best In Show.
