Having run the gauntlet of sibling rivalry at the family home in Auckland from the age of four, it's perhaps no surprise that Ken Pisi developed such lethal, evasive footwork.

His ability to dance his way out of trouble has been honed through years of attempting to emulate his older brothers, Tusi and George. Now he and George are running amok on behalf of Northampton – adding a major dash of Samoan sparkle alongside the Saints' English core.

Last weekend, the pair of them were try-scorers as the Aviva Premiership champions thrashed Sale 43-10 at Franklin's Gardens and director of rugby, Jim Mallinder, made a special point of acclaiming Ken's exploits on the wing this season. Having touched down himself following a quick-step break, the 25-year-old then teed up George for a swallow-dive finish which captured the attention of every nearby camera lens.

Sat together after training this week, ahead of Saturday's Champions Cup showdown with Racing Metro in Paris, George reflected on a job well done seven days ago, saying: 'It wasn't bad – the little one did well, and he set up a try for the old fella too!'

The 'little one' was happy to provide an assist for his outside-centre brother, as a sign of gratitude for providing a hard-knocks education all those years ago. Whether it was in the back garden or indoors, Ken learned the hard way by providing target practice for George and Tusi.

'When we were younger we used to play rugby in the lounge, on our knees,' said George. 'We'd get Kenny to run a straight (line) so we could practise our tackling! My older brother was probably 12, I was eight at the time, so Kenny would have been four or five! We always picked on the little guy!' Ken added: 'I was the tackle dummy for the other two!'

The pair of them were highly amused by the memory. In fact, they are highly amused a lot of the time. They are smilers with a lethal streak on the field; mixing defensive solidity, slick ball skills and predatory running with an eye for the line. First George, then Kenny, established themselves at Northampton and they've gone from strength to strength.

These days, they're team-mates – a situation they relish – but for a time back in New Zealand, they were opponents; which was equally enjoyable, it seems. Billy and Mako Vunipola have spoken of how difficult they found it to tackle each other in matches, but the same can't be said for the Pisi boys. 

'We were playing together for North Harbour, but then I went down to Taranaki and Kenny had another two years at North Harbour,' said George. 'We played against each other a few times. We always wanted to smash each! It was extra special!

'It was all about brotherly love – a lot of love went into those tackles! I would say, "You're a good little player, but I'm still your older brother!". Ken echoed the sentiment, saying: 'On the field, it's a different story; you just want to give it to him! It's all about respect.'

It is respect, Polynesian style. George was born in Apia, capital of Samoa – as was Tusi, who now plays in Japan – while Ken was born in Auckland after the family had relocated to New Zealand for a better life. Both men have come to be adored in the East Midlands, but now they are gearing up to make trouble for many of their English colleagues.

Samoa come to Twickenham on November 22 as a gloriously rising force, if a somewhat disorganised one. They are awash with wonderfully gifted players but tend to be undermined by financial difficulty and administrative chaos. That hasn't stopped George warning several club-mates to expect trouble ahead though.

'I've been giving them a lot of banter,' he joked. 'I'm saying, "You better watch out because the blue army is coming!". They will be s****ing themselves about seeing a few flying Samoans coming their way! It's an exciting opportunity for us.'

Never before have all three players represented their Pacific-island nation together. Tusi and George are well established in the side, whereas Ken has made just three appearances, two off the bench. But armed with Mallinder's endorsement, he is determined to become a regular fixture in a key year leading up to the World Cup, via an historic first home encounter with the All Blacks.

'It will bring the country to a halt. Everyone will be at the game,' he said of the match, to be played in Apia on July 8 next year. Addressing his own hopes, Ken added: 'I see it as a priority this autumn; to play well and try to establish myself in that team, so that next year hopefully I will be at the World Cup. I will play my heart out to do that.' 

On Saturday, the brothers will play their hearts out in Paris, in a back line featuring a third Samoan, Kahn Fotuali'i, at scrum-half. George recognises the need for Northampton to start their campaign with a bang. 'This first hurdle is so important,' he said. 'We went away to Castres last year and lost. If we can beat Racing away, it should set us up. We want to be one of the best clubs in Europe.'

For now, that is the immediate objective, then the Pisis will set out to terrorise Twickenham.
