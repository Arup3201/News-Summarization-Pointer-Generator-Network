A young Afghan woman whose nose and 
ears were cut off after she fled an abusive marriage has revealed the results of the reconstructive surgery to 
rebuild her face.

Aesha Mohammadzai became famous 
across the world after her picture appeared on the cover of Time 
magazine.

The 19-year-old girl became a symbol of the oppression of 
women in Afghanistan after fleeing the war-torn country. Three years later and she has a new face and life.

New face: Aesha Mohammadzai, who became a symbol of the oppression of women in Afghanistan after fleeing the war-torn country, shows off the results of her reconstructive surgery

Aesha's wounds are healing, but she lives with the scars of an ordeal few could imagine

As part of the life-changing treatment, 
her forehead has ballooned and dark, drooping flesh now covers where her
 nose once was - before her husband sliced it off.

Doctors
 placed an inflatable silicone shell under the skin of her forehead and 
gradually filled it with fluid in order to expand her skin and provide 
them with extra tissue for her new nose.

They
 have also taken tissue from her forearm and transplanted it to 
her face to form the inner lining and lower part of the nose.

Aesha's wounds are healing, but 
she lives with the scars of an ordeal few could imagine. Speaking for the first 
time on television to ITV's Daybreak, she told the story behind that
 photograph.

She said: 'Every day I was abused 
by my husband and his family. Mentally and physically. Then one day it 
became unbearable so I ran away.

'They caught me and put me in jail
 for five months. When I came out the judge sent me back to my husband. 
That night they took me to the mountains.

'They tied my hands and my 
feet. They said my punishment was to cut my nose and ears. And then they
 started to do it.'

Aesha, who has never attended school
 or celebrated her birthday, now lives in America. 
Helped out of Afghanistan by a charity, she now has a new family who 
care for her as one of their own.

Aesha said she is 'happy' with her
 new nose and wants her experience to tell a new story, this time one of
 hope.

She said: 'I want to tell all women who are suffering abuse to be
 strong. Never give up and don’t lose hope.'

Aesha’s story was first told in August
 2010 by Time magazine, who published a harrowing cover photo of her - 
horrifying people around the world and symbolising the oppression of 
Afghan women.

When she was 
12, her father promised her in marriage to a Taliban fighter to pay a 
debt.

She was handed over to his family who abused her and forced her to
 sleep in the stable with the animals.

When Aesha was 12, her father 
promised her in marriage to a Taliban fighter to pay a debt. She was 
handed over to his family who abused her and forced her to sleep in the 
stable with the animals.

The UN estimates that nearly 90 per cent of Afghanistan's women suffer from some sort of domestic abuse.

But
 when Aesha attempted to flee, she was caught and her nose and ears were
 hacked off by her husband as punishment. Left for dead in the 
mountains, she crawled to her grandfather's house.

Terrifying: Aesha's nose and ears were sliced off by her abusive husband as she tried to escape their home

'When they cut off my nose and ears, I passed out. In the middle of the night it felt like there was cold water in my nose.

'I opened my eyes and I couldn't even see because of all the blood,' she told CNN reporter Atia Abawi.

Left for dead in the mountains, she 
crawled to her grandfather's house and her father managed to get her to 
an American medical facility, where medics cared for her for ten weeks.

In December, Aesha underwent a fourth operation, lasting
eight hours, at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Centre in Bethesda,
Maryland.

Surgeons said the procedure marks the halfway stage in their
work and they can complete the reconstruction this year.

During the operation, doctors placed an inflatable silicone
shell under the skin of her forehead and gradually filled it with fluid in
order to expand her skin and provide them with extra tissue for her new nose.

They have also taken tissue from her forearm and
transplanted it to her face to form the inner lining and lower part of the
nose.

Previous patients who have had this type of reconstructive
surgery have also had tissue transplanted tissue from the forehead - because it
is the same tone, unlike other areas of the body.

Louisa James, the Daybreak reporter who interviewed Aesha,
said she had now completed the major surgery she required, and she would now
undergo a series of minor nose operations to modify it and make it look as
normal as possible.

She is then expected to undergo surgery on her ears.

They
 then transported Aesha to a secret shelter in Kabul and in August 2010,
 she was flown to the U.S. by the Grossman Burn Foundation to stay with a
 host family.

She was taken in by a charity in New York called Women for Afghan Women who supported her and helped pay for her eduction.

But Aesha soon became unhappy
 and her behaviour gave rise to concern. During one outburst during, she
 threw herself to the floor and slammed her head against the ground, 
grabbing at her hair and biting her fingers.

Her
 primary guardian figure at the centre Esther Hyneman, who witnessed the
 tantrum said no one was able to prevent her from inflicting the 
injuries and they had to call 911 for help, Ms Hyneman  said during the CNN interview.

Nowadays
 Aesha still prefers watching Bollywood films rather than American TV.

She arrived in Maryland 16 months after she came to the U.S. and had spent
 time in California and New York.

Aesha was treated at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Centre in
 Bethesda, which was arranged for her by the office of outgoing U.S. 
Representative Roscoe Bartlett of Maryland.

Couple
 Mati and Jamila Arsala have been caring for Aesha in Maryland, and they
 have a 15-year-old daughter in Miena Ahmadzai, who has become good 
friends with her adopted older sister.
