A Stradivarius violin forgotten in a closet for decades and formerly 
owned by a reclusive U.S. heiress to a copper fortune could sell for as 
much as $10 million in a sealed bid auction next month, according to 
Christie's.

If the 1731 violin, known as 'The Kreutzer' after the
 French concert violinist Rodolphe Kreutzer who once owned it, reaches 
the top end of its pre-sale estimate it would be one of most expensive 
musical instruments ever sold.

The violin is one of the highlights of the sale from the estate of 
Huguette Clark, a reclusive, eccentric heiress who owned sprawling 
Manhattan apartments and palatial homes but chose to spend her final 
decades living in a New York hospital where she died in 2011 at the age 
of 104.

Kerry Keane, Christie's Musical Instruments specialist, poses for a photograph with the Kreutzer Stradivarius, estimated to be worth between $7.5 million and $10 million

After she died, the violin was found in a closet, where it had been for 25 years.

The highest price paid for a Stradivarius violin is $16 million.

A rare
 viola made by the Italian artisan Antonio Stradivari in 1719 that will 
be sold by Sotheby's in a sealed bid auction in June is valued at $45 
million.

'Kreutzer owned and played his namesake Stradivari from about 1795 until his death in 1831,' Christie's said in a statement.

The violin was discovered in the closet of Huguette Clark, a reclusive, eccentric heiress, years after her death

The instrument was a present from her parents, copper magnate and 
politician William A. Clark and his wife Anna, to the then-teenaged 
Huguette.

The violin will be sold in a special auction with 
bidding starting on June 6 and will coincide with the New York sale of 
more than 350 lots from the Clark estate on June 18.
