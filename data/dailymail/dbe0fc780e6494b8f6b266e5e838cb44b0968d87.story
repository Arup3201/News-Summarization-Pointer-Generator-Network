For the royals there is no better way to celebrate a high profile state visit than with British pomp and ceremony.

But while most seemed happy to stick to tradition at Windsor Castle today it appeared not everyone was singing from the same hymn sheet.

That's because a glittering military display went slightly awry as one horse decided to throw its rider to the floor as it made an embarrassing run for it.

Attention seeking: The skittish horse seems desperate to unseat its 
rider causing a few heads to turn as they try and get back in position

Bolt out of the blue: The horse, having unseated its rider, makes a run for it during a military display for the Amir Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah of Kuwait

There was nothing senior royals could
do as the horse bolted in front of their guests from Kuwait during the 
display from the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment.

It
had been organised to kick-off the Queen's welcoming of the Amir of the
middle eastern country as part of the leader's three-day official trip.

Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah was formally welcomed during the somewhat hampered ceremony staged in Windsor, as Britain bids to strengthen its already strong relations with the Middle East nation.

Rebel: The horse could be seen moving out of position during the precession before it unseated its rider

Awkward: The rider looks suitably embarrassed after he was thrown off his horse, while others seemed to want to capture it on film

Professional: He decides there is nothing left to do than make the best of a bad situation and stands at attention

The Queen, Duke of Edinburgh and Prince of Wales were present to greet the 83-year-old Arab leader, who is likely to see the visit as both a personal and political highlight of his career.

Handshakes between the British and Kuwaiti heads of state were made in the centre of Windsor near one of the town’s two stations as well-wishers looked on.

But the full ceremonial greeting came within historic Windsor Castle’s quadrangle where the 1st Battalion Irish Guards were formed as the guard of honour.

The royal party arrived at the castle - said to be the Queen’s favourite home - in a carriage procession accompanied by the dazzling sight of a sovereign’s escort provided by the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment in their breastplates and plumed helmets.

Already waiting was the Amir’s 
delegation, which included his government’s finance, foreign and 
commerce ministers in their flowing robes.

Following tradition Philip, dressed in a
morning suit, top hat and carrying an umbrella, escorted the Arab 
leader to inspect the guard of honour lined up in two rows in front of 
the royal party.

The Amir walked past the massed ranks in
their bear skins and winter coats and at the end of the line 
Philip gestured towards him to review the soldiers standing in the rear.

Waiting: A mounted guard of honour are given instructions as to where to stand, but they are not waiting for a bus as the sign suggests, instead they are waiting to meet the Queen's procession

The Queen and Charles waited patiently under a small gazebo and watched as the two men rejoined them.

An impressive procession was then staged
for the Queen and her guest with the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment
and the guard of honour marching past.

Later after a private lunch with senior 
members of the Royal Family the Amir was shown a small exhibition of 
items from the Royal Collection that have a Kuwaiti theme.

In Windsor Castle's impressive Green 
drawing room the Queen pointed out the objects which included a sword 
and dagger presented to her grandfather George V in 1919 and another 
ornate weapon also from Kuwait and a gift to mark the Queen's coronation
in 1953.

The Amir later visited Sandhurst 
military academy which has a tradition of training the ruling classes of
Gulf states and is where the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry began 
their military careers.

This evening, the Queen gave a state banquet in the Amir's honour at the castle.

Dozens of guests gathered round a extensive table before the Queen gave a speech to mark the beginning of the lavish meal.

In a speech to Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, she praised the 'enduring ties' between the United Kingdom and the State of Kuwait.

'Our relationship runs deep, and the United Kingdom is proud to have played its part in Kuwait's recent history,' the Queen said.

'The future too, holds great promise. Your visit to this country allows us to celebrate the breadth and strength of that partnership.'

The Queen then raised a toast to the Amir and the Kuwaiti people, with the speeches of the banquet broadcast live on Kuwaiti television.

Speaking in Arabic, the Amir made a speech praising Britain as being 'confident, creative, multi-racial, tolerant and welcoming to the world'.

He also congratulated the British people for the success of this summer's Olympic Games, and Team GB for its spectacular haul of medals.

The Queen wore a full-length diamante tulle over white satin evening gown, by Angela Kelly.

It was the outfit she had worn for 
the official Diamond Jubilee photographs, with Queen Mary's tiara and 
Queen Victoria's diamond Collete necklace and earrings.

She presented the Amir with a silver Armada dish.

Guests, who included Sir Mervyn King,
John Major, David Cameron, George Osborne and William Hague, dined on 
poached fillet of turbot, Windsor partridges and pistachio and dark 
chocolate gateau.

Music included a Bach's Violin Concerto in A Minor and the best of The Beatles.

State
visits by foreign heads of state encompass not just the ceremonial but 
political, and economic elements and talks will be held over the coming 
days between British and Kuwaiti politicians.

Kuwait is also a key Western ally in the Gulf and allowed US troops to launch the invasion of Iraq from its territory in 2003.

The
last incoming state visit from oil-rich Kuwait was 17 years ago, when 
the late Amir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah visited the Queen 
at Buckingham Palace.
