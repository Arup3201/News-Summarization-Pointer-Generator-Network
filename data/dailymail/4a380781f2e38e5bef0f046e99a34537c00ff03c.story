Like many teen boys in Beirut, Lebanon, Mohammad el-Shaar had hoop dreams.

The gregarious 16-year-old 'once signed a basketball with his name and he gave it to his mom,' el-Shaar’s friend, Omar Bekdash, 18, tells MailOnline in an exclusive interview. 'He told her, "You keep this because someday I’m going to be famous.'"

On December 27, 2013, el-Shaar got his wish — but for all the wrong reasons.

Tragic photobomb: Lebanese student Omar Bekdash (right) thought the selfie he took of himself with his friends would capture a great day out with pals. Instead it captured the moments before a horrific explosion. A bomb planted in the gold SUV on the top left of the photo killed his best friend Mohammed el-Shaar (wearing a red hoodie)

Hoop dreams: Mohammad, with his mother Nasma at left, had hopes of becoming an NBA star. Before he was killed, he gave her a signed basketball and told her 'You keep this because some day I'm going to be famous'

Early that bright Friday morning, Bekdash and Rabih Yousef, 17, picked up el-Shaar and 18-year old Ahmad Moughrabi. The four were on break from school and looking for a way to spend the day.

'We decided to go grab a cup of coffee and have a jog afterward,' says Bekdash of their plan.

The group drove to an upscale section of downtown Beirut to get their coffees before heading to a nearby plaza filled with fountains and outdoor seating in the shadow of the Starco building, a Swiss-designed complex refurbished after the 15-year Lebanese civil war ended in 1990.

'Mohammad was talking about his family, about his brother and his mom,' says Bekdash. 'We were reminiscing about the time before his little brother came into this world and how afterwards everything changed.'

Their serious conversation turned light when Bekdash took out his phone. He wanted to record their day with a selfie and post the image to Snapchat, a popular mobile app that broadcasts pictures to friends. 'The guys always take selfies, so this time I decided I would take one,' says Bekdash.

The photo captured the looks of quiet amusement on his buddies’ faces — Bekdash closest to the camera on the right and the usually active el-Shaar sitting uncharacteristically still in a red sweatshirt between Moughrabi and Yousef.

Only later would anyone notice the significance of the golden SUV tucked in the upper-left side of the frame. It was forgettable background scenery in an innocuous selfie focused on friends just hanging out. It was also a ticking time bomb, which officials estimate was packed with 50 to 60 kilograms of explosives.

Moments after Bekdash uploaded his photo, the shock of a huge blast knocked the phone from his hand and all four boys toppled as fragments of glass and other shrapnel hurled in every direction. 

Heartbroken: Mohammad's parents and his two brothers are devastated over the the brutal death and loss. 'May ur soul rest in peace our Angel,' his mother Nasma wrote on his Facebook page

'It took a few seconds to realize that it was an explosion because we saw ash and smoke and shrapnel flying everywhere,' Bekdash says of the initial blast, which he notes sounded like fireworks and felt like being shoved and hit over the head.

'As soon as I fell on the ground, I bounced back up to my feet and started running immediately,' recalls Bekdash.

When he got far enough away from the blast site, Bekdash stopped. Only then did he become aware of the bits of glass speckling his leg, leaving him in excruciating pain.

'I wanted to go back but I couldn’t walk, so I sat on a curb,' he explains. 'I couldn’t find anyone. I just saw black smoke everywhere.'

Big brother: Mohammad and his siblings were very close. He was talking about his family in those fateful moments before the car bomb ended his life

Bekdash finally spotted Yousef running towards him, panicked and crying.

'He was yelling that Mohammad is dead and he’s on the ground with blood around him,' he says.

An ambulance rushed Bekdash and Moughrabi to the American University of Beirut Medical Center while Yousef went to the home of nearby relatives, since he wasn’t as badly injured. Bekdash, who required stitches to his leg, face and head, had no idea what to tell el-Shaar's parents after they arrived to the hospital, begging to know if their child was alive.

'I tried to keep my hopes up and convince myself that he was going to be okay, and that I was going to see him again as soon as he got well,” says Bekdash. “Deep down I knew there was no hope of him coming back to us.'

Zest for life:  Mohammad was an athletic teen who wasn't shy about hugigng his friends and telling them how special they were. 'I tried to keep my hopes up and convince myself that he was going to be okay, and that I was going to see him again as soon as he got well,' says Bekdash

He was right. Two days later el-Shaar became the seventh person to die in the blast that reportedly targeted — and killed — Mohamad B. Chatah, a former finance minister. Chatah, 62, was an important adviser to Saad Hariri, leader of the main Sunni party, the Future bloc, as well as a vocal critic of another of Lebanon’s powerful parties, the Shiite-backed militia, Hezbollah.

Today the three surviving friends don’t exhibit many physical scars from their horrific experience, but the emotional trauma they suffered in the blast is still bubbling beneath the surface.

'I can’t stand to look at the picture because I cringe and I get flashbacks,' says Bekdash of the selfie he took that December morning.

And, like el-Shaar before he died, Bekdash understands his future isn’t in this tiny Mediterranean country that's struggling to deal with the internal strife and side-effects from the ongoing conflicts in neighboring Syria.

'Even before the explosion, I knew that the situation would never ever get better,' he explains, 'and every one of us [who was] there at the explosion dreams to get out of here and have a family outside of Lebanon. We know that there are a lot of confrontations between two political parties and people like Mohammad have to pay for it every time.'

Now Bekdash just wants people to remember that his friend Mohammad, an athletic teen who wasn’t shy about hugging friends and telling them how special they were, deserves to be celebrated for who he was — instead of what happened to him.

'It’s sad that he got famous from his death and not from his achievements,' says Bekdash. 'I’m really convinced that if he had lived on he would have achieved huge results from the things he would have done.'

And the el-Shaar family can only imagine whether or not their boy could have realized his dream of becoming a renowned NBA star. 

'His mom is heartbroken because she has been looking everywhere for that ball he signed, and she can’t find it,' says Bekdash. 'But she won’t stop searching.'
