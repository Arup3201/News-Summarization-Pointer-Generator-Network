Unapologetic: Nicky Morgan, secretary of state for education, has shrugged off controversies over the inspection of Christian faith schools

Education Secretary Nicky Morgan last night shrugged off recent controversies over the inspections of Christian schools and launched a stalwart defence of her ‘British Values’ drive.

In the wake of the row over some faith schools in the North East being labelled intolerant, she said she was ‘unapologetic’.

Parents had complained that young children were being asked ‘inappropriate’ questions by Ofsted inspectors about gays, lesbians and Muslims.

Just last week, the Mail reported how a ten-year-old girl came home from school crying after giving the ‘wrong’ answer to an inspector who asked her: ‘What is a lesbian?’

Ariella Wilkinson’s school, Grindon Hall Christian School in Sunderland, has now been put in special measures after the official Ofsted report found that discrimination ‘persisted’ there.

Her mother, Lena, 46, said: ‘The questioning was completely inappropriate.’

However, Mrs Morgan said last night that she would ‘vigorously defend’ the British Values drive because it helped to ‘open young people’s minds’. 

She added: ‘I have no sympathy for those who say that British values don’t apply to them. Every school regardless of faith should be promoting British values.’

The Education Secretary, who has been nicknamed Ms U-turn for abandoning policies by her back-to-basics predecessor Michael Gove, condemned schools where girls might be made to sit apart from boys, or where ‘homophobia goes unchecked’, saying: ‘No school should be exempt from promoting fundamental values.’

The so-called British Values drive was launched last summer amid fears of an Islamist take-over of some state schools in Birmingham. But the new inspection regime has led to claims from other faith schools that they are being unfairly targeted.

Mrs Morgan also attacked ‘old-fashioned nostalgia’ when it came to reforming the education system. In a speech to the political think tank Politeia, she revealed her plans for change were not about an ‘outdated world view’, but boosting social mobility.

Mrs Morgan said: ‘The rationale that underpins our plan for education is simple – it isn’t about an outdated world view or old-fashioned nostalgia. 

'It’s about a refusal to accept that educational attainment must be correlated to the wealth of your parents – that your future life chances are determined not by talent or effort, but by the circumstances of your birth.

‘None of us who believe in meritocracy, whatever side of the political spectrum, can be content with that.’

Congratulating her Government’s achievements over the last five years, she said the attainment gap was narrowing and one million more pupils were now studying in good or outstanding schools. And she described the rationale behind some of the Coalition’s policies, including curriculum, practical skills and ‘character education’.

The latter means putting ‘character-building’ lessons on a par with traditional subjects.

Mrs Morgan said: ‘Just as important to the next generation’s future as getting a sound academic grounding is ensuring they have the resilience and grit to deal with the challenges that life will throw at them.

‘To support schools, we’re investing in character education, supporting projects like the cadets, debating in schools and team-building activities, and providing support to help the best of these projects expand.’

This policy is in stark contrast to Mr Gove’s insistence that education policy should revolve around a thorough grounding in the essentials of maths, spelling, grammar and punctuation.

Mrs Morgan, who replaced Mr Gove last summer, has been previously criticised for giving too much ground to teachers.

As well as promising the unions she would do everything to reduce teachers’ workload, she scrapped Mr Gove’s introduction of snap Ofsted inspections.

And she abandoned his plan to punish misbehaving children by sending them on a run.
