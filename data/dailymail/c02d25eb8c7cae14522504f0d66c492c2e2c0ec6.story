Arsenal have been handed a major boost with the news that Olivier Giroud will return to full training next month.

Manager Arsene Wenger  revealed on Friday that the striker is three weeks ahead of schedule in his return from an ankle injury that has kept him sidelined since August 23.

Giroud wasn't expected back until mid-December, but he may now be fit for first-team action as early as November 29, when Arsenal visit West Brom.

Olivier Giroud looks set to return to training at Arsenal after the international break

'Olivier is coming along very well. He's three weeks ahead of schedule and I think he will join in normal training after the international break,' said Wenger.

'Of course, it's a big boost. He's miles ahead of schedule.'

Danny Welbeck and Alexis Sanchez have carried Arsenal's goalscoring burden in Giroud's absence. The Chilean, in particular, has been in lethal form for the Gunners.

And Wenger  heaped praise on his summer signing from Barcelona, saying the South American's fighting qualities have ensured he's hit the ground running during his first season in English football. He also compared the forward to one of his former transfer targets, Luis Suarez.

'There are similarities, Suarez sometimes gives the ball to the opponent but he gets it back straightaway,' said Wenger. 'Sanchez is the same, there is no time between offence and defence. They are very quick as well.

'If you look across Europe, South America is the only continent that develops strikers. We have to question ourselves, what can we add to our academies to develop strikers again?

'They both played street football with friends. In street football when you are 10, you play with 15-year-olds so you have to be shrewd. You have to show that you are good, you have to fight, win impossible balls.

'When it is all a bit more formulated then you develop less your individual skill, your fighting attitude. We have lost that a little bit in football.'

Sanchez will be aiming to add to his impressive season tally of eight goals against Burnley today. Wenger is set to rest Aaron Ramsey, who still doesn't feel 100 per cent after a hamstring problem. Victory against the Clarets could cut the deficit to league leaders Chelsea to six points.

But while Wenger admits chasing down Jose Mourinho's side will be an uphill challenge, he insists his side are up to the task.

Theo Walcott is making progress in his return from injury but will not play against Burnley 

'I won't write us off, let other people do that,' said the Frenchman. 'It is a little bit linked with mathematics. It doesn't consider who we played, how many times we played away, what is the quality of the team we played against, which missing players we had in the big games. That is absolutely normal but I have a strong belief we will come back and we can prove that on the pitch.

'Chelsea are in a strong position at the moment. I believe it would not be realistic to think that we'll catch Chelsea very quickly.

'We have to get consistent results to get a chance to come back. Personally, I'm more focused on the quality of our games and on the consistency of our results, before we think about coming back on Chelsea.'
