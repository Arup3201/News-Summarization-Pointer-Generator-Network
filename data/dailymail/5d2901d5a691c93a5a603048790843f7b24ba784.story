A video games sales clerk has penned a letter begging parents to think hard before buying young children a copy of the mega hit, and ultra-violent, Grand Theft Auto V.

In a heartfelt letter posted to Kotaku, the game sales veteran says parents are often too preoccupied or indifferent to notice that they’re buying sex and gore-filled games for elementary school children.

‘Last week my store sold over a thousand copies of GTA V,’ he writes. ‘At least a hundred of which were sold to parents for children who could barely even see over my counter.’

Look carefully: A game store clerk says too many parents just buy extremely violent games like Grand Theft Auto V without understanding their graphic content

The fifth installment of the Grand Theft Auto franchise hit store shelves last week. In just one day, sales reached $800 million.

Game maker Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. says the launch is the biggest of any game in the company's history.

Past versions of Grand Theft Auto have been derided by concerned parents and other groups as inappropriate for children and some would suggest that a game whose main objective is to cause as much property damage and bodily harm as possible is inappropriate for any age group.

Nonetheless, the Entertainment Software Rating Board gives the game—as it has all Grand Theft Auto iterations—one of the strongest warnings possible: an M for mature audiences of 17 or older.

A 'deeply disturbing world': The state-of-the-art game cost $270million to make and some fear its realism and ultra-violence will adversely affect children

'Last week my store sold over a thousand copies of GTA V,' writes the sales clerk, 'at least a hundred of which were sold to parents for children who could barely even see over my counter'

Much like the ratings that deem who should, and should not view certain theatrical releases, a group called the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) rates all video game releases based on sexual content, violence, and other factors. They range from E for everyone—which includes games in the vein of Mario Bros.—to Adults only, for the most explicit of games.Grand Theft Auto V, like all its previous iterations, received an M for Mature rating. This means the ESRB recommends that only people aged 17 and over play the game.But with sales of Grand Theft Auto expected to exceed the $1 billion mark, it seems unlikely if not impossible that every parent is abiding by these guidelines.

The concerned game seller is afraid an ESRB rating isn’t enough.

‘Over the years, I have watched the size, story, and graphics of games evolve to provide better player immersion and realism. This is true for all kinds of games, including M-rated games,’ he writes.

But not every parent understand what the ratings are.

‘When I recite the phrases from the ESRB ratings box on the back cover of an M-rated game and it just goes right over your head I feel the need to be more specific,’ the writer continues. ‘So I mention things like a game having a first-person view of half-naked strippers or that the game has a mission that forces you to torture another human being.’

Even such a forthright explanation is often not enough, he writes. ‘In response, I often hear things like, “Oh, it's for my older son" or "All his friends already have it.”’

Sales of the game support this widespread indifference to its graphic content, and the writer admits his own love for such games.

Advanced: 'Over the years, I have watched the size, story, and graphics of games evolve to provide better player immersion and realism. This is true for all kinds of games, including M-rated games,¿ he writes.

The writer says he tries to convey to parents the graphic nature of games like GTA. ¿In response, I often hear things like, ¿Oh, it's for my older son" or "All his friends already have it.¿¿

‘Then I wonder to myself how often the youngest child watches the “older son” playing and if “all his friends” were to jump off a cliff,’ he writes.

'Now this is where those of you who are not parents will sound off with "you should let them judge" or "I killed hookers in GTA III when I was five and I turned out fine." That is great. I accept your opinion. Although, when your daughter comes home from elementary school crying because someone called her a b***h, you might change your tune.'

The writer ends his plea with some simple advice: listen to the person selling you a game and just pay attention to what those games contain:

‘I just ask that you look at the box, ask an associate for guidance, or just be more involved. Lastly, when I try to describe the content and warnings of an M-rated game to you, please don't ignore me and nod while scrolling through your iPhone.’
