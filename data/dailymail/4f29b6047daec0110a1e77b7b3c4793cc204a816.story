Rant: Jennifer Saunders has hit out at the 'corporate-heavy' institution that the BBC has become

Comedienne and writer Jennifer Saunders has hit out at the BBC claiming that the corporation has become 'an executive-run place for idiots.'

The Absolutely Fabulous star said that it is no longer fun to work at the BBC and that it has become 'unrecognisable' from what it once was, in an interview to promote her autobiography, Bonkers: My Life In Laughs.

Miss Saunders described how the BBC has changed since her and comedy partner Dawn French first arrived at Television Centre at the beginning of their career.

She told Glamour magazine: 'It's become top-heavy in such an ugly way. They went corporate instead of being what they should be, which is a national resource, a place which trains people and curates the best programmes, and encourages talent and does great news and journalism.'

'They just became a corporate, executive-run place for idiots.

'It's just so weird that they could put people off coming into the building.'

The 55-year-old star told the magazine how she wanted to shout at one unnamed former director general for preferring to spend money on lavish lunches at the Ivy than on commissioning programmes.

Ms Saunders said that in the old days, the BBC was full of people who were happy to be working there despite getting paid little.

She said that now too much focus is placed on holding 'workshops' to help executives to make decisions.

The Bafta winner questioned the wisdom of appointing people who cannot make decisions already to management roles.

Jennifer also criticised the BBC's move to its new 'soulless' northern centre at Salford Quays in Greater Manchester.

During her 30-year career Miss Saunders has won three Baftas and an International Emmy in 1994 for Absolutely Fabulous, the series she wrote and appeared in as Bollinger-swilling PR Edina Monsoon, alongside co-star Joanna Lumley.

The once highly successful French and Saunders, which ran for 20 years on the BBC until 2007, eventually fell victim to budget cuts at the corporation

Jennifer married Ade Edmondson in 1985, and they have three grown-up daughters, Ella, Beattie and Freya, plus grandson Freddie.

Despite her huge success as Edina alongside Joanna Lumley in Absolutely Fabulous, which was reprised last year for a series of 20th anniversary shows, she told Glamour that the show will not be turned into a film.

She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2009 following a routine mammogram. Tests revealed it to be several malignant lumps.

Miss Saunders underwent chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

Following the treatment she was given Tamoxifen which she has revealed plunged her straight into menopause and depression.
