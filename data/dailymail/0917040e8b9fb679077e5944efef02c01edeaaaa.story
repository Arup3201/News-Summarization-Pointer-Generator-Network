A woman who scaled the heights of the male-dominated boxing profession before quitting in the face of derision over controversial calls in two world championship bouts has denied taking bribes in exchange for making ‘unpopular decisions’.

Thrice-divorced, 65-year-old grandmother Cynthia Jo ‘CJ’ Ross spent more than 30 years working as a boxing judge before walking away from the sport she loved late last year. She is currently living alone in the Nevada desert after her fiancé died and is trying to rebuild her life.

During her impressive career she worked her way up through the ranks from officiating amateur boxing program to world championship bouts in Las Vegas.

Her first professional fight was in Reno in 1992 and when her third husband’s job moved them to Vegas not long after, it provided her with the perfect opportunity to work more fights with better fighters in the boxing-mad city.

Ross was assigned her first title fight in 1999 and by 2012 had worked nearly 500 fights over 20 years including at least 65 bouts competing for a championship belt.

‘I took my time going through the ranks,’ she told Buzzfeed. ‘I was never one to push or to ask for anything.’

Then in July 2012 her glorious career suffered a knockout blow from which it never really recovered.

Ross was asked to judge a WBO welterweight title bout between Filipino champ Manny Pacquiao and American challenger Timothy Bradley at Las Vegas' MGM Grand.

Pacquiao, the only fighter in the sport’s history to win world titles in eight divisions was heavy favorite, while Bradley was a 7-2 underdog.

The fight went the distance and the pundits were all agreed that Pacquiao appeared to have done more than enough to win despite slowing in the later stages.

Instead Pacquiao famously lost his belt to Bradley after a controversial split decision.

Everyone was left stunned after two of the judges – including Ross - scored the bout 115-113 to the unbeaten Bradley, while the other handed the win to Pacquiao by the same score.

The fallout was harsh for Ross. As well as being hounded by the boxing media she received personal attacks on social media.

Angry fans found her Facebook page and she was sent disturbing photos of the butt of a gun and of a cigarette with a bullet in it.

Despite the harassment, Ross still stands by her decision to award the fight to Bradley, rather than fan’s favorite Pacquiao.

‘There was more noise for Pacquiao throughout the fight, so you would expect them to be disappointed,’ she said.

Boxing is a sport beset by stories of mob involvement and gambling through the years.

Questions were asked of the apparently bizarre decisions of the judges, but no evidence was ever found that Ross was on the take.

In fact, Francisco Valcarcel, president of WBO, told BuzzFeed that Ross ‘was very professional and she was very good.’

In spite of the uproar that surrounded Ross’ decision, she returned to the ringside and over the next 15 months, she judged 37 fights, 10 of them with a championship at stake.

The came the fight that was to finish of her career once and for all. In Sept 14, 2013, she was assigned a championship bout between Floyd ‘Money’ Mayweather - boxing’s biggest draw and the world’s highest-paid athlete in the world - and undefeated challenger Saul ‘Canelo’ Alvarez.

Again the match went the distance, but this time Ross was on her own in scoring it as a draw, while the other two judges - and most observers - had judged it a decisive win for Mayweather.

No sooner was her scoring made public, than a tidal wave of vitriol was unleashed upon Ross.

The fighter himself couldn't contain his dismay at Ross’ decision. ‘What the f**k is this?’ he said in the ring after the announcer read Ross’ scorecard.

Alvarez himself said, 'I recognize that he beat me.' Alvarez’s promoter, Richard Schaefer of Golden Boy Promotions, called Ross’ scorecard a 'disgrace.'

ESPN analyst Teddy Atlas raised the question that perhaps foul play was to blame.

‘That criminal, that corrupt … incompetent, whatever you want to call her,’ he told SportsCenter. ‘This is the second time she’s done this.’

‘It speaks to the corruption of the sport,’ he continued. ‘The criminals will be rewarded.’

Two days later, Ross sent an email to the Nevada Athletic Commission informing them that she planned to leave the sport indefinitely.

'I will be taking some time off from boxing but will keep in touch,' she wrote.

Again no evidence has ever been uncovered that lends any credibility to Atlas’ comments.

Since quitting the sport, Ross has been spending time at her modest home in Pahrump, Nevada, where she moved after her third marriage ended in divorce in 2004. She had been engaged to be married before her fiancé suddenly died in 2009.

'What money?' she asked, when interviewed by Buzzfeed. 'Where’s this trail of money at? There isn’t enough to pay me off, even if it was millions.'

'I was pretty disgusted by the whole thing,' said Nick Zagala, a close friend. 'They were just piling on. And I think it’s totally because she’s a woman.'

Shortly after the Mayweather debacle, she was also laid off from her job leading a workout class at a local gym.

Ross, who enjoys wide-open 
spaces and outdoor activities, now spends most of her time alone with nothing to do in the wilderness.

'I think I’m getting tired of the desert,' she told Buzzfeed. 'I’m going crazy here.'
