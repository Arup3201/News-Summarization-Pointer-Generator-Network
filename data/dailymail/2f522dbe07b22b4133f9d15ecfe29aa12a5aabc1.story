A grand wooden staircase with connections to the famous Brontë sisters that was sold in auction in the 1950s has been tracked down to a family home in Long Island, New York.

The Queen Anne staircase was sold off from Blake Hall in Mirfield, West Yorkshire, when the house was demolished in 1954 - and now a Brontë enthusiast has managed to trace it to  the other side of the Atlantic.

Anne Brontë, the youngest of the sisters, worked as a governess at the house in 1839, looking after five of the children of the Ingham family.

Lifelong Brontë enthusiast Imelda Marsden, 68, who tracked down the staircase in Long Island, explained: 'There was Tom, aged six and Mary-Anne, who was about four or five.

'The story goes that Tom was a bit of a handful and used to do all sorts of nasty things and Anne Bronte had trouble controlling him.

'On one occasion, she tied the children to chairs. The family must have found out about this and they dismissed her the same year. She would have worked there for about nine months in all.'

Imelda, known as the 'Miss Marples of Mirfield', said: 'The staircase was once part of Blake Hall and I can remember going there as a very small child.

'But the mansion was demolished and today it's a housing estate. Bits of it were sold to dealers and the staircase went to one in Kensington, London.

'It was sold at auction to a Mr and Mrs Toppings, who had just built themselves a new house on Long Island and were in London looking for things to fill it with.

'They took the staircase and installed it in their house and there it stayed.'

Opera singer Gladys Topping and her husband bought the staircase in 1958 for their new home in Quogue, Long Island.

But six decades down the line no one knew if it was still in the house.

Through tireless research, and the help of the Quogue Long Island Historical Society, Imelda managed to track the stairs down.

In a strange twist to the tale, it was claimed Mrs Topping had seen the ghost of a woman on the stairs in 1962, believed to be Anne Brontë.

The figure, her hair in a bun, was dressed in a long full skirt with a tri-cornered shawl.

Mrs Topping was convincecd Anne's ghost had been exported 3,000 miles away with the staircase.

Indeed, the discovery, which was aided by museum staff in New York, came as a complete surprise to the current owners of the building.

Fellow Brontë enhusiast Hilary Wainwright said: 'The staircase represents a slightly more unusual connection between Mirfield and Anne Brontë.

'Some will know she worked as a governess at Blake Hall for nine months in 1839 and she depicts her experiences there in the first half of Agnes Grey, renaming the hall 'Wellwood' and the Ingham family the 'Bloomfields.'

She wrote two novels, Agnes Grey and The Tenant of Wildfell Hall (left). She died of tuberculosis on 28 May 1849 and was buried in Scarborough, North Yorkshire (right)

'That house was demolished in 1954 and, although the interior parts were dismantled and auctioned off, their fates were lost in the mists of time.

'With one exception. Due to a short article in the Mirfield Reporter back in the 1960s, the wonderful Queen Anne staircase, hand-carved in burled yew, went to a London dealer.

'He then sold it to Allen and Gladys Topping, an American couple he met at Kensington Antiques Fair in 1958 and they installed it in their house on Long Island, New York.

'The story goes that Mrs Topping saw a ghost on the stairs in 1962. Was it Anne? Who knows?

The Bronte sisters (pictured l to r Anne, Emily and Charlotte) were part of a literary family, who lived in Haworth in Yorkshire in the 19th century

'Having checked this much out, our 'Miss Marples of Mirfield' made inquiries abroad but things did not look promising. 

People seemed to think that the house had been lost in one of the many hurricanes that occur so commonly there.

'The breakthrough came when a keen local librarian suggested contacting the Quogue Long Island Historical Society and they tracked down the exact location of the house and contacted the current owner.

'Much to their joy they discovered that not only was the staircase intact but the current owner was unaware of its origins and delighted to invite them over to see it.

'Now Mirfield and Quogue are working together to document this little-known link between them with a view to incorporating it in the bicentenary celebrations.'

The quirky find has come at an important time as preparations are being made to mark the bicentennial of the birth of Charlotte Brontë in 1816.

A number of events are planned both here and in the U.S. to mark the occasion and now the staircase has been found, it is hoped it will become a part of it.

Bronte bicentenaries are going to be celebrated from 2016 to 2020 starting with Charlotte Brontë's birthday on April 21, 1816 followed by Emily's on July 30, 1818 and Anne's on January 17, 1820.

Anne Brontë lived most of her life with her family at the parish of Haworth on the Yorkshire moors. She wrote two novels, Agnes Grey and The Tenant of Wildfell Hall.
