Pimm's has long been considered the ultimate Wimbledon drink - but punters may be getting less than they bargained for.

A glass of the drink costs nearly £8 at the championships, but scientific analysis has revealed that it can be so diluted that it is just 2.5 per cent alcohol.

This implies that the Pimm's served at Wimbledon is less than half as strong as is officially recommended - although organisers insist that they are following the manufacturer's guidelines.

Fan favourite: Pimm's is one of the most popular drinks served at the Wimbledon championships

Pimm's is a gin-based spirit which is traditionally mixed with lemonade before being served in a glass with ice and mixed fruit.

The original drink is always 25 per cent ABV, but the alcohol level of the final product can vary hugely depending on how much lemonade and ice are included.

Wimbledon claims to sell around 230,000 glasses of Pimm's every year - more than 20,000 a day - at a price of £7.80 per drink from the official bars.

The Sunday Times carried out scientific tests on the drinks to determine exactly what punters were getting for their money.

At one bar, the glass contained just one part Pimm's to nine parts lemonade and water - meaning it was only 2.5 per cent alcohol.

The quantity of Pimm's varied at other bars, but no drink was stronger than 4 per cent.

The Pimm's served at Wimbledon is provided by the drinks company pre-mixed with lemonade at 5.4 per cent ABV, meaning that it must have been watered down with melted ice before being tested.

On the Pimm's website, fans are recommended to use one part spirit to three parts lemonade - making a drink which is 6.25 per cent alcohol.

A spokesman for Wimbledon and its contracted caterers told the Sunday Times that customers could request a Pimm's without ice if they did not want to water their drink down.

'The Pimm's comes in pre-mixed sealed containers and we serve it over ice as recommended,' he said. 'The amount of ice in the glass will affect the dilution but you can always ask for it without ice.'

A spokesman for Pimm's added that the pre-mixed drink is 'best served over ice'.

Some Wimbledon spectators criticised the quality of the Pimm's, comparing to a 'soft drink', but others insisted that it is nonetheless a vital part of a day out at the championships.
