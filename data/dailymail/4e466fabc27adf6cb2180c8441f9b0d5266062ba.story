A Russian tourist has been hospitalised with severe lacerations to his leg, after being hit by a speedboat while swimming in Phuket.

Sergey Kuzennyy, 55, was swimming outside of a dedicated swimming zone when he was struck by the blades of a parasailing speedboat's propeller on Wednesday, said Phuket Marine Office Chief Phuripat Theerakulpisut.

Mr Kuzennyy suffered five deep lacerations to his left leg and remains in Mission Hospital in Bangkok.

Speaking on behalf of Mr Kuzennyy, Maria Lukashevich said: 'I was contacted by Mr Kuzennyy and his wife to help them translate, but I was not there when the accident occurred'

'Mr Kuzennyy said that he was swimming at about 5pm on Wednesday at Kata Noi and that he had no idea that he was in an area that swimming was not allowed.

'I would personally like to ask Phuket officials to take action and prevent any further accidents. Incidents like this might prevent tourists from coming here.'

The incident coincides with new rules for jet-ski and parasailing operators being rubber stamped by Phuket Governor Nisit Jansomwong.

The Russian tourist was hit five times by the propeller and was taken to Mission Hospital in Bangkok

Kata Noi beach in Phuket Thailand where My Kuzennyy was stuck is a popular spot with holidaymakers 

However, the plans, which were pushed through  last week, create clearly designated swim zones and jet-ski/boating zones only in  Patong, although there are plans to roll the rules out to other areas of Phuket too.

'The new rules will first be enforced in Patong. We will later introduce them at Kata-Karon and other beaches in Phuket,' Governor Nisit said. 

Marine Office staff concluded that Mr Kuzennyy was swimming in a speedboat zone but Mr Phuripat said that he would look at what safety measures could be taken in addition to those that were implemented earlier this month.

Marine Office staff concluded that Mr Kuzennyy was swimming in a speedboat zone 

Included in the new set of rules to eventually be applied at all provincial beaches is that boats and jet-skis not approaching or departing from the beach must be operated 300m from shore.

Mr Phuripat did not elaborate on whether or not Mr Kuzennyy was swimming beyond the swim zone, or if he was swimming in a beach-approach zone.

The victim and speedboat owner are planning to settle compensation outside of the legal system and nobody is pressing charges, Lt Col Ason Jiraksa of the Karon Police told the Phuket Gazette.

The safest place for swimmers to enjoy themselves is on sections of beach marked with red-yellow flags said Kata-Karon chief lifeguard Uten Singsom following the accident.

More than three million people visit Phuket every year and it is the largest island in Thailand

In the past decade, tourism has become the biggest earner for the area with more than three million people visiting every year. 

Phuket is the largest island in Thailand. At 540 square kilometres, it's about the same size as Singapore. 

Just over an hour by jet from Bangkok or Singapore, and with daily connections to most major Asian airports, Phuket replies on holidaymakers and has seen a  swell in the number of jet-skis and speedboats being used off the island as a result.
