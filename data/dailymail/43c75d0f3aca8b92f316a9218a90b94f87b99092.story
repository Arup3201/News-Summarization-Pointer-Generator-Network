Almost 12 years and 122 Tests have passed since Keven Mealamu made his All Blacks debut in Cardiff but the hooker still relishes the fiery reception.

The battle-hardened front-row has learned to blank out any crude remarks and, with a 100 per cent win rate over Wales, has a habit of silencing the sledgers.

New Zealand’s unbeaten run stands at 25 games and Mealamu will set out to extend that record on Saturday, when he returns to the ground where he first played in 2002 alongside Jonah Lomu, Andrew Mehrtens and Tana Umaga. ‘I’ve got amazing memories from that day,’ said Mealamu, 35.

‘Being able to hear the Welsh inside the closed stadium was something I had never experienced before. You can hear vividly what they’re saying. It’s not just advice on throwing the ball in; I’ve had some comments about my mother, too.

‘You’ve just got to stay cool. There’s no time to tell them to sort it out. Being in a closed stadium you can feel the energy. There’s nowhere for the sound to escape and it’s bouncing off each wall.’

A noisy home crowd will be hoping to inspire Wales to an unlikely victory at the Millennium Stadium. But the odds are stacked against Warren Gatland’s side, with New Zealand plotting to end their season with a resounding scoreline before the squad take a long break.

The 35-year-old has won every time he has faced Wales, and will want that to continue this weekend

Head coach Steve Hansen is expected to name a fully loaded starting XV for the Test in Cardiff, having rested some first-choice players for the narrow victory over Scotland, who frustrated the tourists at the contact area.

‘That’s a constant work-on area,’ said Mealamu. ‘It’s something we want to keep improving because it’s a vital part of our game. If we can nail it then it really sets us up.’
