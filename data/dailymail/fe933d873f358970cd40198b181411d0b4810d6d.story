Opera singer Tamar Iveri has been dumped by Opera Australia over homophobic comments posted on her Facebook page

A soprano has been dumped by Opera Australia after she was accused of labelling homosexuals 'sewage' and 'fecal masses' on her Facebook page more than a year ago.

The company confirmed on Monday that Georgian singer Tamar Iveri, set to star in its production of Verdi's Otello, had been released immediately from her contract.

Iveri was to have played the lead part of Desdemona in the opera, scheduled to open on July 5.

A post on Iveri's Facebook page against a gay pride march in her Georgian home city had brought widespread condemnation, with patrons sharing their outrage on social media and Opera Australia sponsor Qantas expressing its concern.

'I was quite proud of the fact how Georgian society spat at the parade ... Please, stop vigorous attempts to bring West's 'fecal masses' in the mentality of the people by means of propaganda,' read Iveri's comments, which were taken down shortly after they were posted.

The singer has since blamed her zealous Christian husband, Raul Tskhadadze, for posting the comments in her name, saying he had found an article she had been writing about recent gay pride protests, changed it and posted it under her name.

In a statement, Opera Australia said the opinions posted were 'unconscionable', and it acknowledged Iveri had apologised at the weekend.

'Opera Australia has agreed with Tamar Iveri, to immediately release her from her contract with the company,' the statement reads.

'Ms Iveri and her husband have both made public statements in the last 48 hours with regards to comments attributed to Ms Iveri. She has unreservedly apologised for those comments and views.

'Opera Australia believes the views as stated to be unconscionable.'

Opera Australia's decision was supported on its Facebook page with observers unanimously approving of Iveri's sacking.

The opera singer has previously taken to Facebook to hit out at claims she was homophobic, as reported by the Australian media.

'For my entire career I have been working with gay people and some of them are very dear friends,' she posted.

'All of them can confirm that I never lost a word that might associate me with homophobic ideas. I respect every single human being and I am against all kind of discrimination and violence'.

Iveri goes on to explain to context of the post that was made on her Facebook account. She points out that on May 17, 2013, 'a gay parade was supposed to pass directly in the yard of an Orthodox Church in Tiflis', the capital of Georgia.

'At the same place and for the same date a commemoration for Georgian soldiers killed in Afghanistan had been announced.

'For that reason and because Georgia is a country where 90 per cent of the population are deeply religious, conservative Orthodox Christians I wanted to express my sincere doubts that a parade made sense under these circumstances, in the yard of an Orthodox church.

'I was worried that this would provoke people and lead to violence. Unfortunately this is what happened then.'

The opera singer explains that her husband was also using her Facebook account and that he is deeply religious and has a 'tough attitude towards gay people'

'He copied my text, changed it considerably and posted it under my name. You might imagine that I was not happy with that at all and I immediately deleted it when I saw the text about half an hour later.

'This text does not express my own opinion. I'm afraid it was too late and the text was already spreading in the internet.

Iveri said she explained the post and officially apologized to the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community in Georgia a year ago and her apology was accepted and she also denied writing a letter to the Georgian president about the issue.

An Opera Australia spokeswoman said it had been important for the company to take some time to understand fully what had been said, and to exercise due diligence.

She said if Opera Australia failed to do so, it would be acting in a discriminatory way and 'we value fairness for all'.

'Having now taken this time, Opera Australia believes the views expressed by Tamar Iveri to be unconscionable, and has therefore taken action to part ways.

'We have all felt this to be emotional and disturbing and have sought to bring this situation to a resolution as fairly and quickly as possible.'

On Monday, Iveri shared Facebook a post by her husband Raul Tskhadadze, written at about midday Monday, in which he broke his silence to address 'mushrooming pathos and hatred' in the media about the post.

'For me it is hard to watch how affected she (Iveri) is, and watch how people are damaging my most precious person's reputation and her peace of mind due to which she had no share of the underlying,' the post reads.

Mr Tskhadadze has taken all responsibility for the post written last year, in a Facebook post yesterday, which was shared by his wife

Mr Tskhadadze claims to have been responsible for the Facebook post, which caused the 'stir'.

'At that time we used a common Facebook profile, at the same time, I thought to use Tamar's popularity, and to reached (sic) my voice to numerous audience I published a letter on her behalf,' he posted.

'The letter was signed on our Facebook page, when Tamar returned home she erased the letter and got very upset. However, a few minutes were enough for people and for Georgian press.'

Mr Tskhadadze said news of the post was spread by the Georgian press, which nearly cost him 'the price of a loss of personal happiness'.

He said his wife did not initially disclose that the letter was not written by her. 'She had endured and suffered a lot because of the letter which I wrote. Tamar has never been homophobic and especially not against western values,' the post reads.

Mr Tskhadadze then explains why he wrote the post, in light of the funeral of the Georgian soldiers killed in Afghanistan, one which was his best friend.

He said a gay march at the same churchyard where the funeral was taking place 'seemed a provocation' and such reports were spread all over Georgia.

'I believe that society should be naturally tolerant toward people of different sexual orientation, and at the same time people can express their will for freedom, and I thought I could express the fact that someone may not agree with the idea of gay people’s demonstration on the streets.'

Having lived in Europe for a 'few years', he concludes by making comparisons between Georgian and European consciousness and that Georgia is still not ready for some European culture in daily life.

'That is what I wanted to say in the letter. However, I regret that it was not entirely clear... and by this letter I have caused many trouble for my lovely wife and also for myself.'

He finished by stating he understands his responsibility and publicly declares he is to blame for the post on May 17, 2013 and that 'all the damage should be on myself'.

'It is unbearable to me that the year later, when her (Iveri's) explanation and apology after the incident is over in Georgia, released articles in the foreign press again caused controversy around this delicate issue,' the post ends.
