A greedy postman who has been jailed after stealing nearly £250,000 worth of post was using the money to 'feather his nest'.

Paul Doughty, 57, bought a timeshare in the Canary Islands and a caravan, a court was told.

The Liverpool resident also kept most of his ill-gotten gains in bank accounts with balances ranging from £10,000 to £25,000. Royal Mail was forced to pay out £228,935.28 in insurance claims as a result of his crimes.

Officials launched an investigation in 2011 after a number of customers complained they had not received recorded delivery parcels.

The pattern of missing mail soon pointed to driver Doughty and a surveillance operation in August 2011 spotted the Warrington mail centre employee stopping on the hard shoulder of the M6 heading to Birmingham.

Simon Clarke, prosecuting, told Warrington Crown Court: 'A Royal Mail investigation found there had been a sustained campaign of theft of special delivery bulk mail often used for sending reasonably high value items including currency and jewellery.

'He was stopping his Royal Mail HGV at 
the side of the motorway and removing mail sacks and putting them into 
black bin bags before hiding them in bushes at the roadside.

'When he had finished his duty he would return in a private vehicle to collect the bags and dispose of them through what is thought to be a network of buyers.'

He added the total loss to Royal Mail could not be calculated as many people do not report missing post.

Doughty made no comment to a number of questions during police interview and initially pleaded not guilty.

He then admitted fraud charges in March before being sentenced.

His wife Pauline was also accused of having a hand in the operation but the charges were later dropped.

Johnathon Duffy, defending, said Doughty had been an 'exemplary employee' for 16 years.

He added: 'To his shame as he approached retirement, he gave in to temptation.

'He is dreadfully sorry and the consequences to him and his family are going to be disastrous as everything he has saved and worked for will be taken from him.'

Judge Roger Dutton said he had no choice but to jail Doughty for three years and nine months.

He added: 'Those who are employed by Royal Mail have a special position and are regarded as people the public have a high degree of trust in.

'You took thorough and complete advantage to feather your own nest while you and your wife were in a healthy financial position.

'This was pure, unadulterated greed.'
