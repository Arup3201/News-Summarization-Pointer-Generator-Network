Critics are blasting Washington Redskins coach Mike Shanahan over his decision to play a visibly injured Robert Griffin III before he went down in an agonizing injury that made football fans across the nation cringe.

Griffin, known as RGIII, appeared weaker and weaker as the game against the Seattle Seahawks wore on last night, with the fourth quarter fall as the rookie sensation's knockout punch.Â 

The scope of Griffin's injury is not yet known, and he was to undergo additional tests today - including an MRI.

Now that the team is out of playoff contention, many have questioned Shanahan's decision to leave Griffin in the game, and whether he should have been on the field in the first place.

Griffin suffered a mild sprain of the
 lateral collateral ligament located on the outside of the knee against 
Baltimore on December 9, caused when he was hit by defensive tackle 
Haloti Ngata at the end of a 13-yard scramble.

He had been limping earlier in this game last night at Washington's FedEx field, still ailing from that injury.

'It was hard to watch RGIII tonight,' Seattle coach Pete Carroll said. 'It was hard on him. He was freaking gallant.'

Despite Griffin's struggles, the quarterback was not about to accept an early exit.

'I probably would been right back out 
there on the field,' Griffin said. 'You respect authority, and I respect
 coach Shanahan. But at the same time, you have to step up and be a man,
 sometimes. There was no way I was coming out of that game.'

New York Post sports columnist Steve Serby said that despite Griffin's warrior attitude, Shanahan should have known better.

Serby wrote: 'There are times when the coach, in his position of authority, must take that decision out of the hands of the player, and this was one of those times.'

At a news conference today, Shanahan said he talked to Griffin and team doctors on the sideline after each hit during the game, and he felt confident in Griffin until the last play.

A report over the weekend accused Shanahan of lying about Griffin's medical clearance to play after the December 9 injury.

After that game, Shanahan claimed that team doctors had allowed Griffin to return to the field, despite spraining his lateral collateral ligament (LCL).

But Dr James Andrews, a knee specialist who also serves as the Redskins' sideline doctor, told USA Today that Griffin refused an evaluation by the team's medical staff, and ran back out to the field before anyone could examine him.

Dr Andrews told the paper: 'We didn't even get to touch him or talk to him. Scared the hell out of me.'

There were also some concerns about the quality of the field prior to the game.

The grass - or lack therof - was blamed for a separate injury to Seahawks defensive end Chris Clemons, who tore his ACL.

Clemons' agent, Donal Henderson, told NFL.com that the 'crappy' conditions at FedEx Field contributed to his client's troubles.

In addition, Fox Sports broadcaster 
Erin Andrews tweeted: 'Even before tonight's game at Fed Ex, players 
were telling me just how awful the field was..there was barely any grass
 at the 50'

The Seahawks finally won a road playoff game, snapping an eight-game postseason skid away from home with a 24-14 NFC wild-card victory Sunday over the Redskins.

'I think I did put myself at more risk by being out there,' Griffin said. 'But every time you get on the field, you're putting yourself on the line.'

Griffin didn't know what the injury was, and Shanahan said he was scheduled for an MRI to determine the extent of the injury.

Washington won seven straight games 
to win the NFC East title and become the only team in the last 16 years 
to make the playoffs after a 3-6 start.

As Griffin - the No. 2 overall pick in 
the 2012 draft - writhed in pain on the field, many fans stood in 
silence, cupping their hands over their faces as Griffin was being 
attended to.

Several of Griffin's Redskins teammates also stood around the quarterback to see if he was OK.

Though Griffin walked off the field under his own power after several minutes and saluted the fans, the Redskins (10-7) quickly announced he would not return.

'If you didn't pull him out then, you should get fired,' Shanahan said.

Griffin
 went to the locker room to get checked out after going down in a heap 
in the fourth quarter, but walked back out a few minutes later and stood
 on the sideline as only a spectator for the rest of the game.

Seattle's Steven Hauschka kicked his third field goal of the game, and backup quarterback Kirk Cousins couldn't pull off the late-game heroics he displayed a few weeks ago against the Ravens when Griffin was first injured.

Griffin was playing in his third game since spraining his right knee against Baltimore, which also brought Cousins into that game.

While setting a rookie quarterback record with 815 rushing yards this season, Griffin captivated the D.C. area - and the football world - with his dazzling ability to pass and run.

After four straight last-place finishes in the NFC East, the Redskins appear to have a bright future.

As long as Griffin stays healthy, of course.

Sunday's game was only the second playoff contest in NFL history between rookie quarterbacks, and before his injury, Griffin looked more like a first-year player than he had during Washington's impressive run to end the regular season.

He completed 10 of 19 passes for 84 yards with two touchdowns and an interception and ran for 21 yards on five carries.

'I don't feel like me being out there hurt the team in any way,' Griffin said. 'I'm the best option.'

Shanahan said he spoke with Griffin throughout the game about the quarterback's health.

'He said, "Hey, trust me. I want to be in there, and I deserve to be in there," Shanahan said. 'I couldn't disagree with him.'
