The Cairns suburb of Manoora, where the bodies of eight children were found on Friday, has a reputation for crime and violence.

Manoora, along with the suburbs of Manunda and Mooroobool, forms the Cairns West area, which has developed a reputation over several decades as an area where crime and violence are higher than average.

While Cairns is broadly known as an iconic Australian city, and is a popular tourist destination, Manoora is one of several 'problem areas' known to police and local politicians as in need of constant surveillance.

Just kilometers from the glittering Coral Sea and international natural gem, the Great Barrier Reef, Cairns is often categorised as an affluent area despite problems which are obvious to local residents. 

In the wake of the tragic events which claimed the lives of eight children and left one adult in a serious condition, one Twitter used asked, 'How did i know it'd be an M suburb before i read the story?'  

'Eight children dead?' one woman mouthed as tears streamed down her face after hearing the news that the victims, aged 18 months to 15, had been found in a house on Murray Street.

Residents, along with family and friends of the deceased, took refuge together near a children's playground at a small park on the street. 

Some said they were waiting anxiously to hear whether their child one was one of those who had died. 

'I felt sick when I saw the picture (of the house on TV),' local Pastor Nicole Dalla Vecchia said.

Ms Dalla Vecchia was one of the local community members to comfort relatives of the children, calling the events heartbreaking.

'It doesn't matter if you know them or not, it breaks your heart.'

Shd said that although the area had been branded as notorious in past years, the area housed a  close-knit community that stood by each other.

Two teenage sisters who live nearby and knew one of the older children laid flowers under a tree.

'They're a close, tight-knit, loving family,' Jade Aitkinson, 14, said.

'We're all very tight and this is a very big shock to the area.'

Local state member, Gavin King, had previously noted the high concentration of social housing with a large number of low socio-economic families in the area. 

Cairns has seen a population boom, with government statistics revealing that two-thirds of recent population growth in North Queensland had happened in the city. 

Murray Street had CCTV cameras installed by the police after the street was one of four areas identified by Cairns Regional Council in their funding submission to the Queensland Government in need of permanent surveillance.

In June, media revealed the suburb was at the centre of a secret government report into youth sexual abuse and domestic violence.  

Up to 80 per cent of homes in the suburb are public housing – the highest concentration in any regional Queensland city.

'We do need to change the physical make-up, environmental make-up, of that area because it absolutely contributes to the problems faced in that community,' Mr King told the Cairns Post earlier this year. 

Mr King noted that 'problem spots' had been ignored, and that the introduction of CCTV into the area was being introduced to address that. 

Local website Cairns Lifestyle reported that the 'M suburbs' were not recommended by locals for being worthy places to buy or rent.

'The Cairns M suburbs are densely populated with housing commission rental properties, and due to the presence of this demographic these suburbs should be considered a write off,' the post said.

'Violence and crime are common in these suburbs.' 

In September a 63-year-old Manoora man was charged the attempted murder of a 31-year-old man, and in February 2013 three men were found to be holding a man prisoner. 

Murray Street resident Rebecca Levers said that the whole neighbourhood was shocked and heartbroken that something this tragic had occurred. 

'I've liver here seven years and this is the first major crime that's happened,' Ms Levers said.

‘It’s heartbreaking knowing there were kids involved, I think it’s a big shock to the community’.
