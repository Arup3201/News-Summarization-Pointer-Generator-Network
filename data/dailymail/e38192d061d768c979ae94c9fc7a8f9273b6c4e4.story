She has been slowly overtaking the Duchess of Cambridge as ruler of the Windsor fashion roost, and now the Queen's style has been given the ultimate seal of approval.

Donatella Versace has said she sees the monarch as a fashion icon.

'She is couture,' said the Italian designer.

'I could put her in the colours in this collection, the lilac, pale pinks and purples, but my dream was to put her in black,' she said to the Sunday Times as she discussed her new summer range

Her latest, glamorous collection will grace the runway at Paris couture week at 8pm tonight.

Versace thinks the Royals are behind the rise in young and wealthy Britons coming to her with a keen interest in couture.

'I call it the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge effect,' she said.

The designer said she would love for the Duchess to wear one of the sleek Grecian draped dresses from her summer collection.

'She can wear anything because she has a fantastic body.'
