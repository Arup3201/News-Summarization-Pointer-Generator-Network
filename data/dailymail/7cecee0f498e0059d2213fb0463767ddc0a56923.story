Veterans in suburban Boston gathered in a park to mark Memorial Day this year rather than hold a parade because of failing health and dwindling numbers.

The city of Beverly called off its parade this year because so few veterans would be able to march.

The parade has been a fixture in the town since the Civil War.

Aging population: With most WWII veterans now in their 90s, fewer are able to take part in parades and there seems to be little interest from veterans from younger generations in certain areas

Red, white & blue: A couple photograph themselves amongst a sea of flags on Boston Common in Boston. The flags were placed by the Massachusetts Military Heroes Fund in memory of every fallen Massachusetts service member from the Civil War to the present.

Vietnam veteran Ron Innocenti tells WBZ-TV he hates canceling because of the message it sends to current service members. But he does understand the reason.

Many veterans who were gathered at the Herman A. Spear American Legion Post this weekend are upset by the decision.

'It’s not right to me,' says Ron Innocenti. He is a Vietnam veteran who has not only marched in the city’s Memorial Day parade in the past, he says he has also been its grand marshal.

He hates to cancel because of the message it sends to men and women serving now.

In our own way: The town of Beverly in Massachusetts has cancelled its Memorial Day Parade for the first time since the civil war because of its aging veteran population

Remembering: Bob Lewis looks over a field of crosses with names while participating in the College Point Memorial Day Parade in New York. Lewis made the crosses, 137, for all the service members that were killed from the Civil War to the Vietnam War

'It’s a slap in the face to them that we’re not doing it,' he says. 'But on the other hand, I can see why we’re not doing it because of the age of the veterans we have now.'

That gets to the heart of the problem. In Beverly, there just are not enough veterans alive who are well enough to march in the parade anymore.

As for younger veterans – like the men and women who have served in Iraq or Afghanistan – they are often too busy to take part.

World War II Navy veteran Bill McPherson tells NECN he's upset about parade cancellation but 'there aren't that many of us left.'

'My wife and I have both been quoted as saying we are upset by the whole thing,' said McPherson.

There are veterans that are OK with the fact there is no longer a parade. People like the town's Veteran's organizer Jerry Guilebbe

He says it can be difficult for older vets to take part.

'It's not about parades and down the 
street and waving flags, it is about what we did all week long, spending
countless hundreds of hours putting flags on every veteran's grave, and
remembering who they were,' said Guilebbe.

Calm: Some veterans are fine without there being a parade. Showing their support in other ways, such as placing flags on the graves of the fallen, can help

The show must go on: Other parades still take part in many towns and cities across the country. Here. a float passes by during the College Point Memorial Day Parade in New York

Tom Condon is the town's oldest veteran, at 93, he recalls those who were lost.

'That people remember, who left and never came back, which is a lot of them, that's who I remember,' said Condon.

Tom's daughter Suzanne, believes that it is about more than older vets who can no longer march a mile.

'It's a little bit of a reflection to people who are in younger generations not really realizing how many people fought for us and how hard life was for them to make life great for us,' she said.

'It’s very disappointing to me; I think it’s a shame,' says Robert Driscoll, a local veteran who served in Korea. 'Hopefully maybe next year we can change that.'

City officials think that if enough veterans come forward to participate next year, or if the city can come up with another way to have them be a part of the parade, then the city will bring it back.
