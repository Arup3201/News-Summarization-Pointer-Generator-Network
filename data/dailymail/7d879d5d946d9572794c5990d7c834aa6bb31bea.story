The former owner of the South Florida clinic that supplied performance-enhancing substances to Major League Baseball players and other athletes has been sentenced to four years in federal prison.

The sentence for Anthony Bosch came today as Alex Rodriguez, Bosch's best-known client, issued a hand-written apology to fans. 

A-Rod wrote that he takes 'full responsibility for the mistakes that led to my suspension for the 2014 season.' 

However he also pointed out that his punishment was the longest suspension in league history - and urged fans to move on.  

Four years: Anthony Bosch prepares to turn himself in at federal court in Miami after he was sentenced to four years in prison for running a South Florida clinic that supplied performance-enhancing substances to Major League Baseball players and other athletes

US District Judge Darrin Gayles imposed the sentence Tuesday on Anthony Bosch, who was seeking a more lenient term because of his cooperation in the investigation. Prosecutors said Bosch could still get his sentence reduced through further cooperation.

Bosch pleaded guilty in October to conspiracy to distribute testosterone to athletes from the now-closed Biogenesis of America clinic in Coral Gables. One customer was New York Yankees star A-Rod.

Gayles said Bosch was under the influence of cocaine during the time he committed his crime. 

'My addiction took the best of me,' Bosch told Gayles. 'I can't put into words how sorry I am.'

Bosch became a key witness for MLB, which has been paying his legal and security bills after suspending more than a dozen players based on information he provided.

Choking back tears during the court hearing, Bosch apologized for putting lives in jeopardy.

'My choices were terrible and I'm ashamed of myself,' he said. 'I can't put into words how sorry I am.'

Gayles gave Bosch until 11,15am to surrender to the US Marshals, the New York Daily News reports. 

Meanwhile, Rodriguez issued a handwritten apology Tuesday 'for the mistakes that led to my suspension' but has turned down the team's offer to use Yankee Stadium for a news conference and has failed to detail any specifics about his use of performance-enhancing drugs.

The five-paragraph statement issued three days before the team opens spring training, was addressed 'to the fans.'

Rodriguez says 'I regret that my actions made the situation worse than it needed to be' and 'I'm ready to put this chapter behind me and play some ball.'

The 39-year-old, a three-time AL MVP, was suspended last season for violations of baseball's drug agreement and labor contract. An arbitrator found 'clear and convincing evidence' Rodriguez used three banned substances and twice tried to obstruct the baseball's drug investigation.

Bosch and Rodriguez are expected to testify if Rodriguez cousin Yuri Sucart and ex-University of Miami pitching coach Lazaro Collazo go to trial as scheduled in April.

Professional athletes paid Bosch as much as $12,000 per month for testosterone-filled syringes and creams, federal officials have said. 

He was also accused of selling performance-enhancing drugs to high school athletes, charging between $250 and $600 per month, according to an indictment.

Bosch's cooperation with MLB investigators led to the suspensions of Rodriguez; Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Ryan Braun, who was the National League's most valuable player in 2011; Baltimore Orioles outfielder Nelson Cruz; Everth Cabrera of the San Diego Padres and Jhonny Peralta of the St. Louis Cardinals.

None of the players have faced criminal charges.

Bosch also served as a witness for the federal government in prosecuting a handful of former associates from his former clinic.

To the Fans,

I take full responsibility for the mistakes that led to my suspension for the 2014 season. I regret that my actions made the situation worse than it needed to be. To Major League Baseball, the Yankees, the Steinbrenner family, the Players Association and you, the fans, I can only say I'm sorry.

I accept the fact that many of you will not believe my apology or anything that I say at this point. I understand why and that's on me. It was gracious of the Yankees to offer me the use of Yankee Stadium for this apology, but I decided that next time I am in Yankee Stadium, I should be in pinstripes doing my job.

I served the longest suspension in the history of the league for PED use. The Commissioner has said the matter is over. The Players Association has said the same. The Yankees have said the next step is to play baseball.

I'm ready to put this chapter behind me and play some ball.

This game has been my single biggest passion since I was a teenager. When I go to Spring Training, I will do everything I can to be the best player and teammate possible, earn a spot on the Yankees and help us win.

Sincerely,

Alex
