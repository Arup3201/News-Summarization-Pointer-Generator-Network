Iran's President Hassan Rouhani arrived home today to shouts of 'death to America' from hardline protesters.

While hundreds of Iranians gathered at the airport to cheer his return to the country after a week of UN talks, around 100 others gathered outside to throw eggs and shoes at his car.

The hardline activists also waved a banner and some threw stones, according to Iran's news agency.

Hassan Rouhani has spent the week away for international talks including a summit at the UN

Rouhani and Obama shared a phone call after a handshake opportunity earlier in the week didn't happen

They appeared to be protesting against Rouhani softening relations with the West, and particularly a 15 minute phone call he shared with Barack Obama yesterday.

News of the call surprised reporters after a handshake between the two leaders failed to materialise at the United Nations headquarters.

They spoke through an interpreter in the first direct contact between a U.S. and Iranian President in more than 30 years.

Obama told journalists at the White House the the call was the result of Iranian officials 'reaching out' though Rouhani has since claimed it was a U.S. initiative.

Iran's political leaders have been slow to react to the news, but Alaeddin Boroujerdi, head of national security and foreign affairs, tentatively welcomed the conversation as a sign of the Islamic Republic's 'position of authority'.

'This (phone call) shows that Iran's place in the world is of critical importance. That the president of America insists on a telephone call is a sign of sincerity.'

While Obama spoke to journalists Rouhani used his Twitter account to share the news

Obama also asked Rouhani about the fate of three Americans imprisoned in Iran: Saeed Abedini, Amir Mirzai Hekmati and Robert Levinson. Abedini was imprisoned for setting up home-based Christian prayer meetings, Hekmati was sentenced to death for espionage, and Levinson, a former FBI agent, disappeared.

Rouhani also found himself as the subject of scorn earlier in the week when he admitted in an interview that the holocaust had happened.

Though Rouhani's more moderate stance has won over Western diplomats he face stiff opposition in his home country

The acknowledgement marked a break from eight years of holocaust denial by Rouhani's predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as part of his rhetoric against the Jewish State of Israel.

Though Rouhani said the exact numbers and scale of the massacre were best left up to historians, the remark still prompted Iran's news agency to accuse CNN of mistranslating his comments.

Rouhani has since gone on to repeat the admission, and CNN says it stands by its work.

The news comes at the end of a week which has seen a dramatic thawing of relations between Iran and the West.

Rouhani
 has said he wants to end the stand-off between Iran and America over 
his country's nuclear programme, which Ian claims is for peaceful 
purposes but the West has long suspected will be used to make atomic 
bombs.

Addressing a UN summit on the issue, Rouhani said he would 
like the dispute to be resolved in 'months rather than years' and called
 for Israel to sign up to a treaty on nuclear weapons.

He has 
consented to more international inspections and diplomats will have to 
deliver a detailed plan to fresh UN talks next month aimed at dispelling
 fears that the country is developing nuclear weapons.

In return 
Rouhani has said that he expects all sanctions on his country to be 
lifted, which have cut oil exports in half, devalued the Iranian 
currency and crippled the economy.
