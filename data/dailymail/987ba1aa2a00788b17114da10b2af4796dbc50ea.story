A row has broken out in Germany over a church painting which appears to show Nazi leader Adolf Hitler standing next to Jesus.

Recent cleaning of the painting - first unveiled when the Christus Church in the northern Bavarian city of Hof was consecrated in 1939 - shows the uncanncy likeness to the former Fuehrer. 

There is the toothbrush moustache, the hair parted on one side and the staring, maniacal eyes which made him a dark Messiah to so many Germans.

The painting, which was discovered at the Christus Church in Hof, northern Bavaria, which appears to show Hitler standing next to Jesus 

Evangelical pastor Martin Goelkel, who recently left after eight years at the church some call the 'Nazi Temple,' believes the likeness is just co-incidental but its discovery so long after it was painted is causing a stir among his flock.

'Some people have called this a Nazi place over the years but I don't think this is true,' he said. 

'It was designed and inaugurated in a severe time for Germany, no question, but if I interpret the pictures correctly they are now about the glorification of the powerful during this time.

'On the contrary; the individual is made aware that his life belongs to Christ no matter how powerful he feels personally - there is another power over him, a stronger power.  

'This is no Hitler homage, in my eyes. We find people asking something of Christ, there is someone kneeling before him. God resists the proud, but the humble he gives his grace to. 

'Hitler, however, stands imperiously at the side, alone, wearing boots, his robe somehow militaristic. Haughty and arrogant.

'He looks like a rabbit before slaughter. He is a man on the edge, an outsider.'

Former pastor of the church Martin Goelkel, has defended the painting and said that it is in no way an homage to the Nazi leader, pictured 

Asked if he ever had a problem preaching in the vicinity of such a portrait he replied: 'Not at all. Jesus is the winner. This is the message!'

He claims that in all the years that the church has been open for worship no-one has objected to the Hitler painting near the altar. 

But now there are rumblings of discontent with some parishioners calling for him to be erased.

'It is not right under any circumstances that the biggest mass killer in history should be featured in a painting in a house of Christian worship,' one of the flock said in a recent interview on Radio Bavaria.

Pastor Goelkel added that he thought the painting should not be removed. 'This image is a central challenge to Nazism: Christ is in the middle. The powerful can stand idle as much as they want,' he said.
