A grand jury will now decide whether any charges will be filed against a Texas father who fired one fatal shot at a 17-year-old boy he found in his teenage daughter's bedroom early Thursday morning.

As photos of victim Johran McCormick emerged on Friday, his heartbroken family said the least they expect is an apology from the gun-wielding dad, who constables say was on 'several medications' at the time of the incident.

'I would like my baby back, but I know that's not possible,' the victim's mother, Zakia McCormick, told KHOU 11 News.

'I have never ever felt a pain like this. Ever.

'(I want) a call, you know. ''I'm sorry''. He didn't deserve to die that like.'

Gone too soon: Johran McCormick, 17, was shot dead early Thursday morning after sneaking in to the house of a 16-year-old girl. His sorrowful mother Zakia says she expects the girl's father to call her and apologize

Daddy got his gun: An unidentified father (pictured above on a stretcher) shot dead a 17-year-old boy after finding the teen in bed with his 16-year-old daughter this morning in Spring ,Texas

Authorities have confirmed Johran McCormick, a 17-year-old Klein Collins High School student, was not armed when he was shot

Investigators said the suspect's 16-year-old daughter let the boy into the house. 

The father told police that he was woken up by one of his four children who said someone was in the house, which is located on the 22300 block of Bridgestone Ridge Dr in Spring.

At first, the daughter denied knowing the boy and an argument ensued between the stranger and the father when he wouldn't listen to the father's commands.

When the teen reached for something, the father shot and killed the boy. 

Authorities say the teen was unarmed.

The 16-year-old daughter later admitted to knowing the boy and letting him into the house. 

The father was seen being brought out of the house on a stretcher.

He was transported to hospital with symptoms of a panic attack, according to reports.

A news release from the Harris County Sheriff's Office said officers are preparing a case that will be presented to the grand jury.

It is not uncommon in Harris County for grand jurors to decide if a crime was committed in fatal shootings that may have self-defense claims or other legal issues, according to the Houston Chronicle.

In 2008, a grand jury declined to indict Pasadena retiree Joe Horn after he fatally shot two burglars in the back as they ran across his front yard.

Horn made national headlines because he was on the phone with a 911 operator who was telling him to stay inside and out of harm's way.

The Nov. 14, 2007, call ended with the sound of Horn racking a shell into his 12-gauge shotgun's chamber, followed by three gunshots that killed Colombians Diego Ortiz, 30, and Hernando Riascos Torres, 38.

Police showed up at the house shortly after 2:30am when they received a 911 call from one of the father's other daughters

Lied: When first asked, the father's 16-year-old daughter said she didn't know the boy she was in bed with, but later took it back

Grand jurors in that case decided the act was a justifiable use of deadly force and did not constitute murder.

The men had taken about $2,000 from the home next door to Horn's.

Horn's defense hinged on his assertion that he had fired out of fear for his life, making the shooting justifiable under Texas law.
