This brings new weight to the term 'chasing rainbows', because chasing this colour spectrum would literally mean running in circles.

During a recent trip over Cottesloe Beach in Western Australia, 46-year-old aerial photographer Colin Leonhardt happened upon a rare natural phenomenon.

'The pilot and I were on our way back from shooting a grand final AFL match in rural Perth. It was raining softy, and the sun was peering through the clouds.

'As we went through the trailing edge of the rain, the sun was low and setting and the sunlight just created this amazing rainbow. It just evolved in front of us.'

Think quick: Leonhardt took over 50 images for the five minutes it remained a complete full circle rainbow

According to NASA, the full circle rainbow is 'an observer dependent phenomenon primarily caused by the internal reflection of sunlight by raindrops'

'I had never heard of it before, not to mention seeing one in person. We looked at each other and said 'what the hell is that?' 

Leonhardt says he trusted his instincts on how to capture the moment.

'My experience with this sort of thing is to shoot first, then ask questions. I starting snapping like there was no tomorrow.'

He took over 50 images for the five minutes it remained a complete full circle rainbow.

'Once we reached the beach, a big burst of light came through and the whole thing really lit up. Then it faded as quickly as it came.'

'As soon as I got home, I started researching. Basically it's a very rare phenomenon that relies on specific conditions. 

'It needs to be low sun-so early mornings or evenings-and it has to be straight after a storm, with light coming through the rain.'

When Leonhadt uploaded the images online, they spread like wildfire.

Leonhardt received a spate of emails from scientists and astronomers who said they had 'never seen anything like it' 

Leonhardt (right) says he probably wouldn't attempt to  find the circle ranbow a second time due to the exorbitant costs of aerial photography

Apart from getting media attention from all over the world, Leonhardt was also contacted by a wealth of scientists and astronomers-including none other than NASA.

'I received a bunch of emails from people in those fields. They were so excited, they said they had never seen anything like it.

'Next thing I knew, I got an email from NASA. They wanted to use my image for their Astonomy Pic of the Day. I thought 'why not?''

According to NASA, the full circle rainbow is 'an observer dependent phenomenon primarily caused by the internal reflection of sunlight by raindrops.' 

When asked if thought he would try to chase the rainbow down a second time, Leonhadt said 'in the end of the day, aerial photography isn't cheap. 

'It costs $1000 every time you want to get up there. With how rare these things are and how difficult it would be to replicate the moment, I'm not sure if I could justify a second time.'
