Liz Hurley has become embroiled in fresh controversy over her range of children’s bikinis – with critics branding them unsuitable for young girls.

The actress was bombarded with angry comments after she used Twitter to advertise her controversial collection, which includes skimpy designs aimed at under-eights.

The model, who was accused of sexualising young girls after initially unveiling the skimpy, two-piece designs two years ago, faced a backlash from her followers who insisted ‘kids should look like kids’.

The 49-year-old used her personal Twitter account to ask her 450,000 followers: ‘Going somewhere hot at Easter? Check out our Swim Collection.’

She then added: ‘Our Kids collection is divine too.’ Miss Hurley then added a picture of the kids bikinis on display in Harrods, before uploading a link to her website where the items are sold.

However, one follower, Lee-Anne Compton wrote back: ‘I’m all for kids looking fab, but looking like kids and safe in the sun.’

EM Grant then posted the message: ‘KIDS? Leopard Print bikinis on KIDS!?’

Julia Hall then wrote in disbelief: ‘What ages are the kids!?’

The actress’s website features several children wearing the skimpy designs while striking poses more suitable for adult models.

It includes items for the under eights, such as an animal-print ‘Mini Cha Cha Bikini’ which costs £32.90 and is modelled by a blonde child with both hands placed precociously on her hips.

Another design, called the ‘Collette Bikini’ is advertised in the 8-13 age range, and is described as being ‘great for girls who want to look grown up’.

Campaigners have previously hit out at Miss Hurley’s bikini collection, calling them ‘disturbing’.

Dr Katherine Rake, chief executive of the Family and Parenting Institute charity, said the designs put pressure on parents by attracting young girls to the notion of growing up too fast.

She says: ‘Parents have been telling us for a long time that they want their children to be able to enjoy childhood. We’d like young girls to be encouraged to emulate Olympic stars like Ellie Simmonds and Rebecca Adlington when in the swimming pool - not models in leopard print.’

In a report in 2011, Reg Bailey, chief executive of the Mothers’ Union, set out a series of guidelines to be met in order to prevent the sexualisation of young children.

One of the recommendations was for ‘retailers to offer more age-appropriate clothes for children and sign up to a code of practice which checks and challenges the design, buying display and marketing of clothes, products and services for children’.

A spokesman for Miss Hurley has previously defended the designs saying they are hugely popular with parents and children.

It was last year that Gwyneth Paltrow was also accused of sexualising children after endorsing a range of bikinis for girls as young as four, and which she was selling through her lifestyle website, GOOP.

The website says the design is perfect for little girls who want to match their mothers, as the top is an exact copy of the adult version - also sold on the website.
