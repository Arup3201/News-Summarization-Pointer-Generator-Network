He has been accused of using corporate jargon where normal language would do.

And it seems the similarities between BBC executive Alan Yentob and the corporation’s self-mocking comedy W1A don’t end there.

On Saturday, creative director Mr Yentob bore an uncanny resemblance to the 2014 series’ character Ian Fletcher – the broadcaster’s fictional ‘Head of Values’ played by Hugh Bonneville.

He was seen in London folding away his Brompton bicycle, a much-admired model which costs around £1,000.

It comes days after the 68-year-old – who earns £330,000 a year – was ridiculed for patronising the working classes by referring to them with the marketing term C2DEs.

On Saturday, the casually-dressed BBC boss put aside the criticism to dine with a friend at the exclusive San Lorenzo restaurant in Knightsbridge.

The Italian-style restaurant was a favourite haunt of the late Princess Diana’s. 

Mr Yentob, who earns £330,000 a year for the BBC, insisted last week that the corporation did make programmes for C2s and DEs – a technical term for the working classes
