Teenager Beckii Handy refused to have a hysterectomy despite being diagnosed with ovarian cancer

A 15-year-old turned down a hysterectomy despite becoming one of the youngest women in the UK to be diagnosed with ovarian cancer.

Beckii Handy visited her GP, complaining of what she thought was indigestion.

But she and her parents Jan and Chrys Handy, were shocked when doctors revealed the teenager was suffering a type of cancer, more often diagnosed in women over the age of 50.

As part of the treatment doctors suggested was a hysterectomy - the removal of the womb, which would have left Beckii unable to carry her own children.

But the teenager bravely refused, determined to maintain her fertility and ability to bear children.

'The doctor started to examine me and it became very painful,' she said. 'I was sent for tests but I never dreamed I would be told I had cancer.'

Beckii, from Solihull in the West Midlands, bravely refused a hysterectomy to maintain her hopes of having children in the future.

'There was no way I was having it and they couldn’t do it without my permission,' she said.

'Due to my stubbornness, I can hopefully now go on and have children.'

Beckii was diagnosed in August 2011 and underwent two types of chemotherapy treatment.

The now 18-year-old was given the all-clear in January 2012.

She has forged links with the Ellen MacArthur Cancer Trust, which gives young people in recovery from cancer the chance to rebuild their confidence through sailing.

And earlier this month she teamed up with British Olympic sailing star Sir Ben Ainslie to take part in the J.P Morgan Asset Management Round the Island Race around the Isle of Wight.

'When you get the all clear, people expect you to have this big celebration but it is something I really struggled to deal with,' Beckii said.

'You’re left thinking: "Well, what now?" The Trust has been amazing and I have made some great friends through it.

'If I had not gone to the doctor that day, I probably would not be here now.'

Diagnosed at 15, Beckii is thought to be among the youngest women in the UK to be diagnosed with the disease, which is usually seen in older women. Beckii is pictured with her mother Jan Handy

She also urged teenagers to have any health problems checked out promptly.

'I get annoyed when friends tell me they have aches and pains but they haven’t been to the see the doctor,' she said.

'I think young people can get embarrassed about going to the doctor but what is a bit of embarrassment if it saves your life?'

The J.P Morgan Asset Management Round the Island Race is one of the largest participation sporting events in the UK and the largest yacht race of its kind in the world.

Organised by the Island Sailing Club in Cowes, it has been dubbed ‘Britain’s favourite yacht race’, regularly attracting around 1,500 boats and 16,000 competitors.
