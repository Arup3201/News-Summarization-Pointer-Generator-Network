No matter how brutal their crimes, most Florida death row inmates are given their choice of a last meal and while some ask for typical fare, others  leap at the last chance for indulgence.

While the recent execution of Florida murderer William Happ made headlines last week for its controversial use of a new drug, his choice of a box of chocolates and a tub of ice cream wouldn’t strike anyone as ill advised.

While decadent choices are the norm, other inmates—including one very notable female killer—opt for more Spartan last meals.

Indulgent: Rapist and murder William Happ, Florida's most recently executed inmate, made headlines when the state chose to use a new drug to do the job called midazolam. Also notable was his choice of a box of chocolates and a tub of chocolate ice cream as his last meal

Before Panhandle Killer Arthur Rutherford was put to death in 2006, he requested some foods true to his southern locale, reports the Orlando Sentinel.

A deep fried feast of fried catfish, fried green tomatoes, fried eggplant, and hush puppies were laid out for him before his lethal injection. Rutherford washed it down with sweet tea.

Clarence Hill, an attempted bank robber and cop killer, asked for tacos. So did Angel Nieves Diaz, who murdered the owner of a Miami strip club while he and accomplices robbed it.

Oba Chandler, who raped and murdered an Ohio woman and her two teen daughters after they asked him for directions in 1989, asked for salami sandwiches and a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

Simple: When Oba Chandler was about to be put to death for raping and murdering a woman and her teen daughters in 1989, he chose to eat salami sandwiches on white bread and a peanut butter and jelly sandwich

Wasted: Killer John Spenkelink's execution was notable for two reasons--one, he was the first person executed after the Supreme Court lifted the ban on capital punishment, and two, he was drunk when it happened. Florida has since banned alcohol as part of the last meal

Deep fried: The Panhandle killer Arthur Rutherford stayed true to his deep south locale when he asked for fried catfish, fried green tomatoes, fried eggplant, hush puppies, and sweet tea

John Spenkelink got a special treat at his 1979 execution. Not only was he the first in Florida to be put to death following the Supreme Court’s reinstatement of the death penalty, but he also got to split a flask of Jack Daniels whiskey with the prison superintendent.

Aileen Wuornos’ seven-man killing spree was immortalized in the 2003 film Monster, but her life came to an end the year before. She declined a last meal and instead drank just a cup of coffee nine hours before she was put to death.

Taking the opposite route was Allen Lee Davis, who murdered a pregnant woman in 1982 along with her two young daughters. He chose to have a smorgasbord of lobster tail, fried potatoes, a half-pound of fried shrimp, six ounces of fried clam strips, half a loaf of garlic bread and 32 ounces of A&W root beer.

Restrictions: Florida now limits last meals to $40 each. They must be prepared at the prison and the food must be purchased locally

Crunchy or soft? Though Angel Nieves Diaz killed a man in a strip club, he did not ask for buffet cocktail wieners. Instead, he chose tacos. Clarence Hill, a cop killer and attempted bank robber, also chose the Mexican dish

Allen Lee Davis's execution became infamous when the state's brand new electric chair after retiring 'Old Sparky' caused him to scream and bleed from the nose. His meal of a lobster tail, a half-pound of fried shrimp, six ounces of fried clam strips, garlic bread and 32 ounces of A&W root beer was also conspicuous

Famous: Aileen Wuornos, whose wild murder spree became the Charlize Theron film Monster, declined a last meal and had only a cup of coffee 9 hours prior to her 2002 execution

In addition to the extravagance of his meal, Davis’ execution became well known its goriness after the killer convulsed and screamed as blood gushed from his nose. Davis’ was the first execution that utilized Florida’s new electric chair in 1999, which replaced the rickety oak ‘Oak Sparky’ chair that had been in use since 1924.

All inmates in Florida must request their last meal ahead of time and each meal must be prepared in the prison.

That means no fast food. Extravagance is now also frowned upon and meals may not cost in excess of $40. No booze has been allowed since John Spenkelink’s indulgence with the superintendent.

Inmates must eat their meals, according to the state’s Death Row Fact Sheet, from a tray and, oddly enough, with a spork.

From lobster tails to fried green tomatoes to a simple cup of coffee, the last meal requests of Florida inmates are unpredictable and varied
