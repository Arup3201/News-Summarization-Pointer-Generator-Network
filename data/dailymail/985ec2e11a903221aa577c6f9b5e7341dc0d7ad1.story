As the world's highest-paid DJ Calvin Harris is usually hidden behind the decks of a super club, but now the Grammy-winning Scot has stepped out from behind the turntables to be unveiled as the face and body of fashion label Emporio Armani.

The handsome 30-year old seems totally at ease in front of the camera in campaign shots released today, showing off his buff body, long legs and blue steel pout.

In fact, he wouldn't look out of place in a male model line-up, but when exactly did this happen? When did Calvin Harris get so damn hot?!

Because the 6ft 5in music man hasn't always been quite so polished. 

Back in 2007, as he released his debut album I Created Disco, Dumfries-born Calvin - whose real name is Adam Wiles - was a pale and scruffy brunette who favoured a battered leather jacket, hooded tops and loose jeans. 

But roll on a few years and the award-winning producer, who is signed to music company Three Six Zero, has ditched the hair dye, hired a stylist and started working out. A lot. 

In the name of investigative journalism we have traced Calvin's transformation from so-so to super fit. 

Calvin has morphed from gawky twenty-something to a suave 30-year-old in the last seven years

Living in LA seems to have helped: 'The food is fantastic over here. You can eat healthily, there’s a lot more healthy options than in the UK — that’s a fact.' he told The Sun when he moved there in 2012. His daily routine now involves eggs for breakfast ('egg-white omelette with smoked salmon and spinach for protein, fibre and omega-3') and a trip to the gym before hitting the studio.

Calvin has also learned to love his height. In the past the lofty chart-topper has admitted to being bullied at school for being different: 'It was hard being the tallest person in class. Especially when you are a teenager. You want to keep your head down. I did anyway.When you are a spotty awkward teenager, you don't want people to look at you. It's a self-conscious thing. Everyone looks at you because you are extra gangly. It's only in the last five years that I have come to terms with the fact that I am a big tall b******.' he said in 2009.

The DJ shared this six-pack snap on Twitter on Tuesday with the caption 'Need more stepladders #Armani #BehindTheScenes #LaughingAboutSomething,'

Other photographs shared by the artist showed off a toned chest and perfectly coiffed hair

But the biggest difference to Calvin's look has been embracing his natural blonde hair in 2012. 'I just don’t have time for that s*** any more in my life, and as I approach 30, I don’t think it’s a good thing for a man to be doing,' he said at the time.

'It’s just part of growing up, coming to terms with myself as a human being and not doing that s*** any more. I prefer my more natural look. If anyone doesn’t, they’d be preferring something that isn’t actually real — so it’s like you’re preferring an imaginary idea of someone who doesn’t exist. You either like it or you don’t like it.'

We like it Calvin, we like it a lot.

Designer Giorgio Armani says of the DJ: 'Calvin Harris is a truly cosmopolitan, dynamic young man who is capable of attracting the masses with his music and energy. He isn't a model by nature, and this creates a more sincere and engaging bond with the public.'

This lucky lady is model Aarika Wolf who is the first women that the musician has been publicly linked with since splitting from Rita Ora ealier this summer. It is understood Calvin met the 21-year-old American model after she was cast as one of a number of lingerie-clad women for his Blame music video filmed in August
