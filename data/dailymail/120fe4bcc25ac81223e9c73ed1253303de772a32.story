On the rolling greens of the genteel Aldeburgh golf club, the talk is  usually of turf and tees.

That is, until it was rocked by allegations of inappropriate behaviour between married members – and claims of an ‘Ayatollah’ at the helm.

That is the damning judgment of an employment tribunal, which accused the club of conducting a ‘witch hunt’ against a well-regarded employee, and ordered it to pay £50,000 in compensation.

secretary and a married female member. Bill Beckett (right) refutes allegations of inappropriate behaviour

It 
labelled club secretary Bill Beckett an ‘overbearing and aggressive 
. . . Ayatollah’, while former club captain Steve Beaumont was branded 
‘ignorant and naive’.

The
 trouble started when rumours swept the club that ‘something happened’ 
between Mr Beckett, 69, and a married member, Juliet Brereton, 73, at a 
party.

Days
 later, assistant secretary Margaret Chadwick claimed to have seen Mrs 
Brereton – who is married to Phil, 81 – pinching Mr Beckett’s bottom. 
Her submission stated that Mrs Brereton told him: ‘Bill, everyone loved 
the barbecue and I loved squeezing your bottom. Let me squeeze  it 
again.’ 

Mrs
 Chadwick, 58, quietly discussed the incident and its impact on the 
130-year-old Suffolk club with senior members. But when details leaked 
out, she was escorted from the premises – and two months later, 
dismissed. Mrs Chadwick, who was given the compensation for unfair 
dismissal,  yesterday said she was pleased at the outcome but had been 
through a ‘terrible ordeal’.

‘I’m not jumping for joy – I would rather have kept my job. But here we are and at least justice has been done,’ she said.

Mrs
 Chadwick had worked at the club – England’s second oldest heath course –
 since May 2008 and received no complaints until Mr Beckett took over in
 April 2012. 

Within weeks she felt ‘criticised and bullied’, and in June 2012 was given a written warning to turn around her performance. 

She
 went to then club captain Mr Beaumont and made a formal complaint. The 
tribunal in Bury St Edmunds heard that he replied: ‘I do not regard Bill
 Beckett’s behaviour to you as bullying and there has been no physical 
violence.’

Scandal: Mrs Chadwick was escorted from Aldeburgh Golf Club in Suffolk and later sacked after she said she saw Bill Beckett have his bottom squeezed by a female member, a tribunal found

Mrs
 Chadwick was later accused of making ‘unprofessional and unfounded 
remarks’ and ‘escorted’ from the £1,000-a-year club. She was sacked in 
October 2012.

The tribunal heard Mr Beckett and Mrs Brereton ‘categorically, vehemently and consistently’ deny acting inappropriately. 

The
 club accused Mrs Chadwick of spreading rumours to discredit her boss. 
But employment judge Robin Postle said its investigation was ‘one-sided’
 and its findings ‘irrational and unreasonable’.

It
 was ‘not unreasonable’ for Mrs Chadwick, a mother of one who is married
 to solicitor Richard, 68, to raise concerns about rumours of 
inappropriate behaviour being ‘openly discussed within the club’ – 
particularly as similar allegations had engulfed a previous secretary. 
Judge Postle added: ‘One cannot get away from the feeling that the 
claimant was the victim of nothing short of a witch hunt.’ 

Mrs
 Brereton, who runs a guest house in Aldeburgh, last night insisted the 
claims were ‘made up’. She said: ‘A new club secretary arrived with a 
new way of doing things and she didn’t like it. Her husband is involved 
with the law and perhaps she saw a way to make some money.’ 

Mr
 Beckett could not be contacted but the club said it had ‘full 
confidence’ in him. Captain Tim Rowan-Robinson said the tribunal was 
‘disappointing’, adding: ‘The club refutes claims over secretary Bill 
Beckett’s behaviour, which was fully investigated at the time.’
