However Real Madrid remain top of their Euro League division over their bitter rivals, just by points difference.

Neymar helped Brazil beat Chile 1-0 at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday in a feisty contest and had to withstand several brutal challenges from the South American rivals.

Before the international break Luis Enrique's Barcelona had won their El Clasico contest to move four points clear at the top of La Liga.

Neymar and his Barcelona team-mates return to La Liga on Sunday, taking on Celta Vigo as they continue to compete for a treble of trophies.
