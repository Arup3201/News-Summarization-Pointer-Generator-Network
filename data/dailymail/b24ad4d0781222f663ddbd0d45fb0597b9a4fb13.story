As if the game did not have enough excitement surrounding it already, what with Louis van Gaal taking charge of his first competitive match at United, McIlroy;s appearance is certain to delight Reds fans.

The devoted United fan, quoted by The Mirror, said: 'I am going to enjoy this week. I have a week off. It has been a great summer. I am not sure if I am ever going to have another summer like this.

'I will be back home in Northern Ireland at the end of the week. I don't know if I can parade the Claret Jug and the Wanamaker Trophy at the same time at Old Trafford on Saturday but I will try.

'I will go to Old Trafford for the first game of the season on Saturday (against Swansea) and bring the Claret Jug with me. That will be a great thrill and then come back over to the States and get ready for the FedEx Cup. I want to let this all sink in. I may never have a summer as good as it has been in 2014.'
