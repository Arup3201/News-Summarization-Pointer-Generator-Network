A man accused of murdering his wife on their honeymoon and making it look like a scuba-diving accident was acquitted today after the judge in his trial threw out the case.

Circuit Judge Tommy 
Nail issued his ruling before the defence had even presented its case in
the two-week-long trial of Gabe Watson, and before jurors were given the case to 
deliberate.

Mr Watson, 34,
had faced a sentence of life in prison without parole if convicted of 
murdering his wife, Tina Thomas Watson, in 2003.

He has already served 18 
months in an Australian prison after pleading guilty there to a 
manslaughter charge involving negligence.

Mr Nail
agreed with defence arguments that prosecutors failed to show Mr Watson 
intentionally killed the woman.

Prosecutors claimed he drowned her for 
insurance money, but the only eyewitness testified that he thought Mr Watson was
trying to save the woman.

The state's evidence was 'sorely lacking' and did not prove Mr Watson had any financial motive, according to the judge in the trial in Birmingham, Alabama.

'I
don't think anyone knows for sure what happened in the water down 
there,' Mr Nail said. He repeatedly clashed with prosecutors during both the
trial and earlier hearings.

Prosecutor Don Valeska said he had never 
before had a trial end in a judge's acquittal in 41 years of trying 
cases.

Defence attorneys
had argued that Mr Watson did not stand to gain anything monetarily because
Tina Watson's father was the beneficiary of her life insurance policy. 
They contended her death was an accident.

Gabe Watson's 
father, David, hugged his son in the courtroom after the judge made his 
ruling. He said every court that had looked at the case determined Gabe 
did not intentionally kill his wife.

'I'm just so relieved. Hopefully he can put his life back together,' David Watson said.

'I hope everyone can begin to heal. The rest of his life will determine his legacy. Gabe is a good kid.'

Gabe Watson left the courtroom hand-in-hand with his second wife, Kim, without commenting to reporters.

Tina
Watson's father, Tommy Thomas, had testified earlier in the day. He 
described how his family's grief and shock over Tina Watson's death 
turned to suspicion of Gabe Watson.

Prosecutor Mr Valeska walked with his arm around Mr Thomas, who appeared to be in shock and stunned by the judge's decision.

'It should have gone to the jury for them to decide,' Mr Thomas said of the judge's decision.

Shortly after the death, Mr Thomas testified, his wife Cindy was worried about Mr Watson's condition.

But evidence showed relations between Mr Watson and his wife's 
family frayed quickly as the Thomases began having doubts about what 
happened and Mr Watson started asking for Mrs Watson's belongings.

However, the judge did not allow Mr Thomas to testify that his daughter 
told him her husband has asked her to increase the value of her life 
insurance.

Mr Nail described the claim as hearsay and said it would be inadmissible as evidence.

Mr Watson was accused of turning off his wife's air supply and trying to cash in on her death, but the judge questioned his motive for the alleged crime earlier this week.

The prosecution called the director of the funeral home which handled Mrs Watson's death to testify that her husband had removed her engagement ring before she was buried.

But Mr Nail then ordered the jury out of the courtroom and proceeded to question the prosecutor's argument that this showed a greed motive in the alleged killing.

'You mean to tell me that [Gabe Watson] bought the engagement ring, married her, he and his family paid for a wedding, he planned and paid for a honeymoon halfway around the world, all so he could kill her to get an engagement ring he bought in the first place?' the judge asked.

Mr Nail's scepticism reflected the increasing fragility of the prosecution argument in the light of the failure to find a convincing motive for the alleged killing so soon after what seemed a harmonious wedding.

Montre Carodine, a law professor at the University of Alabama, said the judge's decision to end the trial without the defence even presenting evidence was a 'serious indictment' of the prosecution's case, particularly considering it was a capital trial.
