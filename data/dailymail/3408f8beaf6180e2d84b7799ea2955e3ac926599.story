A school has been forced to offer anger management lessons to children as young as five after 40 children were excluded for bad behaviour.

Psychologists and other mental health professionals have been drafted in to help pupils at Hillcrest Primary School, in the run-down Leeds suburb of Chapeltown.

The moves comes after Ofsted inspectors labelled conduct at the West Yorkshire school unacceptable. A total of 40 pupils were excluded in just one year.

Under fire: In the latest Ofsted report, inspectors point to some progress but say more needs to be done at Hillcrest Primary School (pictured)

The school is now receiving the highest level of ‘behaviour support’ from Leeds City Council - the only school in the city to do so.

In the latest Ofsted report, inspectors point to some progress but say more needs to be done.

Inspector John Young said: 'The deputy headteacher overseeing this aspect [behaviour] has a good understanding of potential flashpoints.

'Some pupils are taught in ‘nurture’ groups while others receive counselling in anger management and improving social skills.

'Joint working with a learning support unit and an educational psychologist is helping the school to break the cycle of poor behaviour some pupils have fallen into.'

This month’s Ofsted report also criticises achievement and teaching at the 429-pupil school.

However, In the 17 months since its last inspection, the school was said to have failed to have made sufficient progress.

Headteacher
Teena Thomson said: 'We are obviously all disappointed that the Ofsted 
team did not feel that Hillcrest has made adequate progress.

'We were, however, pleased by the acknowledgement of the positive actions being taken, particularly in improving behaviour.'

Nigel
Richardson, director of children’s services at Leeds City Council, 
said: 'Hillcrest has been facing a number of challenges.

'We
have put in place expertise from within Leeds and a number of other 
initiatives to ensure that the necessary improvements are made.'
