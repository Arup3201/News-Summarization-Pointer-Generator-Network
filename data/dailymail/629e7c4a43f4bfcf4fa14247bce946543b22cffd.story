This is a side of My Kitchen Rules' contestant Ash that Australia hasn't seen before.

Daily Mail Australia can reveal Ash Pollard, 28 - dubbed one of the villains of this year's show alongside her best friend Camilla Counsel, 23 - is a keen actress and dancer with a penchant for partying.

Photographs obtained by Daily Mail Australia show Ms Pollard clutching cigarettes and what appears to be alcoholic beverages while getting down on dance floors at nightclubs with friends.

It can be revealed that Ms Pollard, who is one half of the Victorian team, attended a posh private school on the Gold Coast, Queensland, where the family is understood to live.

She has studied acting, performed as a dancer in many theatre events and worked in the media industry, according to a 2013 theatre biography.

Ms Pollard graduated from All Saints Anglican College in Merrimac, on the Gold Coast, in 2003. 

The past students' association celebrated her appearance on MKR in a Facebook post this week, a commenter writing: 'Good to see ash's drama/acting abilities haven't weakened!!!'

After she left school, the MKR contestant moved to Sydney to acting school, where theatre documents said she was 'mentored by Hugh Jackman and Dean Carey along the way'.

The contestant - now known for her acid tongue on the reality TV show - then moved to Los Angeles, California, where she worked in film and television.

The biography was produced for a performance she of A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Forum at Williamstown Little Theatre in Victoria, where she was cast as a promiscuous nun. 

'She has very much enjoyed playing a slutty nun,' the November 2013 document said.

Ms Pollard had spent more than 15 years dancing as of 2013, and her performing credits include Shakespearean classics The Taming of the Shrew and The Merchant of Venice, as well as Measure for Measure, Blood Wedding, Chess the Musical and Arsenic and Old Lace. 

Her sister works in Queensland as a veterinarian technician and her father is the director of a tiling and stone-washing company, according to Facebook.

On a social media profile, Ms Pollard is connected with what appears to be a profile of War Machine, the UFC martial artist who is facing life in a Californian prison if found guilty of charges of beating his girlfriend, porn star Christie Mack, however Ash says doesn't know the American man, with a Seven spokeswoman telling Daily Mail Australia: 'She doesn't know who he is.'

'Ash has lived in Victoria for 4 years,' the Seven spokesperson also told Daily Mail Australia. 'She has studied acting but has never worked as an actress - it's a hobby.

Camilla and Ash will cook for the first time on the show on Sunday night, in MKR's so-called 'instant restaurant challenge'.

The Network has promoted the pair as socialites who love 'rubbing shoulders' with the stars and 'love everything European', with marketing material purporting that Ms Pollard's current job is an events manager, which Seven said she had worked in for five years.

'Our social calender is absolutely brimming,' Ms Pollard said. 'One half of the year it's polo, the second half it's the races.'

She described Melbourne as the 'Paris of the south' in publicity material. 

Ms Pollard defended herself from claims she was this season's 'villain' in interviews with Sunrise and KIIS FM this morning.

'They don't know anything about me,' she told Samantha Armytage and David Koch. 'So that's all I would have to say to them. They're wrong.'

'We're not awful people. People have been dubbing us, or me, the villains.

'It's a bit unfair because you are seeing things on the television and perhaps things have been edited.'

But she added that they knew what they were getting into.   

'At the end of the day things we knew what we were coming into and it is what it is. So we have to put with the critics, I suppose.' 

She told Kyle and Jackie O that their characters had been 'exacerbated' by TV editing.
