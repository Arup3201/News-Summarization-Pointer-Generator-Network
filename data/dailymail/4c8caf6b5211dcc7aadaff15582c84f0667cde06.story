Astronomers have discovered a planet orbiting a nearby sun at just the right distance for an Earth-like climate that could support life.

The planet, which orbits a star 42 light years away, sits in the so-called Goldilocks Zone, the band around a sun where temperatures are neither too hot nor too cold for liquid water to exist.

'The star HD 40307 is a perfectly quiet old dwarf star, so there is no reason why such a planet could not sustain an Earth-like climate,' said Guillem Angla-Escude from Germany's University of Goettingen.

Dr Angla-Escude led the research alongside Mikko Tuomi at the University of Hertfordshire.

It is one of three super-Earth type planets recently discovered orbiting HD 40307, doubling the number of known planets in that system to six.

Of the new planets, the one of greatest interest is the one with the outermost orbit from the star.

The planet has a mass at least seven times that of Earth but it orbits at about the same distance from its sun, meaning it receives a similar amount of solar energy as Earth gets - increasing chances it may be habitable.

More than 800 planets have been discovered outside our solar system since the first was detected in the early Nineties, but only a handful of those have been in the habitable zone.

Even more rare are planets in the zone that rotate, as this one does, to create a day-time and night-time, which increases the chance of an Earth-like environment.

Asteroid belts like the one in our own solar system may be the key to tracking down life elsewhere in the universe, a new theory proposes.

An emerging view proposes that asteroid collisions with planets may provide a boost to the birth and evolution of complex, intelligent life.

This might sound surprising; asteroids are generally known - and feared for - for their potential to trigger mass extinctions after catastrophic impacts with our own planet.

However, according to the theory of punctuated equilibrium, occasional asteroid impacts might accelerate the rate of evolution by disrupting ecosystems to the point where species must find new adaptation strategies.

Those that don't spin are said to be tidally locked, with one half in constant darkness.

'This is the closest one to Earth in a habitable zone that is not tidally locked,' University of Hertfordshire astronomer Hugh Jones said.

'The longer orbit of the new planet means that its climate and atmosphere may be just right to support life.Â 

'Just as Goldilocks liked her porridge to be neither too hot nor too cold but just right, this planet, or indeed any moons that it has, lie in an orbit comparable to Earth, increasing the probability of it being habitable.'

The planet, named HD 40307g, is part of a system that was previously thought to have just three planets, all in orbits too close to the star to support liquid water.

The astronomers made the discovery, unveiled in a research paper in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics, by examining data from the HARPS spectrograph, attached to a European Southern Observatory telescope at La Silla in Chile's Atacama desert.

The HARPS device is able to pick up tiny changes in the colour of the light coming from a host star as it wobbles under the gravitational influence of orbiting planets.

The team used a novel technique to filter out signals caused by the host star itself.

'We pioneered new data analysis techniques including the use of the wavelength as a filter to reduce the influence of activity on the signal from this star,' said Mikko Tuomi.

'This significantly increased our sensitivity and enabled us to reveal three new planets around the star.'

David Pinfield, also of the University of Hertfordshire, who leads the RoPACS network, under the auspices of which research was carried out, commented: 'Discoveries like this are really exciting.

'Such systems will be natural targets for the next generation of large telescopes, both on the ground and in space.'
