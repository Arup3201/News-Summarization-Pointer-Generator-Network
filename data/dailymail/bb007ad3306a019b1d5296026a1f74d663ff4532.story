These amazing pictures show Britain’s last remaining mud-horse fisherman still at work and determined to continue using the centuries old technique - despite falling profits.

Adrian Sellick, 56, is the fifth generation of his family to use the method, which sees him lie on his belly and push a wooden sledge across mudflats.

The bizarre technique allows him to get to the tide’s edge where he sticks stakes into the mud and hangs nets between them to catch shrimp.

Mr Sellick, of Somerset, learned the art from his father, Brendan, when he was just eight years old and says he plans to continue for at least another decade.

His father, who harvested shrimps, eels, cod, sea bass and dog fish, worked for 60 years before ‘retiring’ into the family shop.

But father-of-four Mr Sellick said dwindling numbers of fish and shrimps meant he was now forced to take a night job to make ends meet.

He said: 'I can’t survive on what I make now, it’s not sustainable like it used to be years ago. The supermarkets have come in now and taken all our business away.

The technique has been practiced for centuries, and two generations ago it was commonplace

A mudhorse is a cross between a barrow and a sledge with a flat wooden base and a plank sticking out.

The base is a wooden cage made up of four poles.

The fisherman loads it with buckets and kets and pushes it out two miles into the mud when the tide is low.

To set up the nets at a strategic point, they must have an encyclopedic knowledge of the flats and fish.

It is then a waiting game. When the tide goes out again, there should be a bounty of catch in the nets.

'We put it down to living next door to Hinkley Power Station too, we have lost a good 75 per cent of our shrimp since that was put in.

'We used to get loads of shrimp years ago, now I’m lucky to get a basket full.

'I work nights at Yeo Creamery now to make ends meet. That is my income, that’s what we survive on.

'I really enjoy mud-horse fishing, I would rather be outside than in a stuffy factory, but that is the reality now.'

The mud-horse is a hand-built wooden sledge which enables Adrian to navigate his way over the treacherous mudflats of Bridgwater Bay.

The technique was used by many families only a couple of generations ago.

Once he has sledged out and set up the stakes, he simply waits for the tide to wash in and out - flinging fish into the nets.

Mr Sellick added: 'I was about eight or nine when I first went out, my dad used to put nets down and I would go out and collect the fish twice a day.

'That shows you how things change.

Both found the technique difficult at first but agree that it is worth the effort

'As long as I can I will continue, unless someone like my sister wants to take it over. It’s a young man’s job now.'

The senior Mr Sellick, Brendan, who still prepares fish at the family’s shop, added: 'I can remember my dad putting me in a basket two miles out, dad chasing a conger eel and me being worried.

'I can see him now, I was just a titch.'
