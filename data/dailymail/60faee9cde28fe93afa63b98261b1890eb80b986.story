The mother of a four-year-old boy feared dead after he fell into the sea told yesterday how she was ‘destroyed beyond words’.

Dylan Cecil tumbled into treacherous waters from a slipway before his parents’ eyes on Sunday evening.

The parents, Rachel McCollum and Darren Cecil, both jumped in after him but were unable to reach their son and passers-by had to pull them out after several minutes.

Paramedics treated the couple for 
water ingestion while lifeboats launched a search for the boy, who was 
fully clothed when he fell.

Yesterday Miss McCollum, 27, wrote on her Facebook page: ‘Destroyed beyond words, my heart, soul and life ripped apart.’

She and Mr Cecil, 30, of Kettering, 
Northamptonshire, had been with Dylan and his younger sisters – Faith, 
three, and one-year-old Alice – on a slipway that is several hundred 
feet long and juts into the water at Burnham-on-Sea in Somerset.

The rescue operations continued 
throughout the night and resumed at first light yesterday as Dylan’s 
distraught family watched from the seafront, but coastguards called off 
the search late yesterday afternoon.

Vince Irwin, coastguard sector manager
for North Devon, said: ‘We’ve had an extensive search throughout last 
night, the early hours of this morning and again this afternoon and have
covered every possible area that we can think of.

‘As you would expect it’s not good news for the family, like it’s not good news for us. They were very upset.’

The waters off Burnham-on-Sea have 
very strong currents, and even when the tide is out the area is well 
known for its dangerous mudflats. It is feared Dylan was swept away by 
the spring tide, which can reach speeds of five knots.

Dave Hughes of Swansea Coastguard 
said: ‘When the tide does ebb and flow there, it’s very, very fast and 
powerful. It can sweep an adult off his feet.

'It’s a very, very 
dangerous area.’

Dylan had been visiting his grandparents Dave and 
Jackie McCollum, who live in Brean on the Somerset coast, while his 
parents had a short break in Dorset, from which they had just returned 
on Sunday.

Yesterday a bunch of flowers was left 
at the top of the jetty with a card that read: ‘To our darling little 
Dylan, all our love and kisses, Seaside Nan and Granddad.’

As he watched rescue crews continue 
their search for his grandson’s body, Mr McCollum said: ‘We just want 
him back – we are all devastated.

‘You never think something like this is going to happen to you.

‘It is a terrible feeling knowing my grandson is out there somewhere, all alone.’

He added: ‘He is a brilliant boy – he loves Sonic the Hedgehog.

‘Dylan used to call us “Seaside Nan 
and Granddad” because we live here by the sea. His mum and dad are 
really cut up, they are absolutely devastated. We just want our baby 
home.’

Dylan’s grandmother added: ‘We want 
him back so we can start the next stage of the grieving process. It is 
just unbelievable. We are all struggling to come to terms with what has 
happened.

Working round the clock: On Sunday night rescue workers searched with helicopters, lifeboats and other crews into the early hours

A police and RAF helicopter were also 
involved in the search and rescue operation and further teams were 
helping with the frantic hunt at first light

‘We would like to thank rescue crews for all their efforts.’

Supintendent Keith McCoubrey, of Avon 
and Somerset Police, said yesterday: ‘At 6pm in the evening the family 
went on to the beach with Dylan and their two other children.

‘At some point Dylan wanted to go and see the sea. Unfortunately he slipped off the edge of the jetty and went into the water.

‘He had only run out a couple of feet then stumbled in. He went under and didn’t come back up.’

He added: ‘A rescue operation was then
launched with the coastguard, RNLI and full support of RAF search and 
rescue helicopters.

Rescuers were out again at first light. Dylan slipped off the jetty about 100 metres from the shore

Keeping watch: Police and paramedics were on stand-by looking out for the little boy although the chances of him being found alive after so long in the water were now slim

'Unfortunately at this time we have been unable to 
locate Dylan. Our hearts, minds and sympathies go out to his family.’

Mark Newman, a member of the Burnham Area Rescue Boat, was one of the first on the scene.

He said: ‘It was a really sad and 
frantic sight. The parents of the boy were both there – they had just 
been pulled out of the water after jumping in to save their son.

‘There was a mixture of shock and raw emotion.

‘Mum and Dad had ingested a lot of sea
water but they didn’t go to hospital. Quite clearly they were upset and
didn’t want to leave their son.’

Members of the RNLI search the waters at Burnham-on-Sea in Somerset where a 4-year-old child was reported missing at 6pm Sunday night

Hunt: The boy fell into the water, which is known for its strong currents

The little boy's parents desperately tried to find him and had to be treated for water ingestion in their attempts

Emergency services scoured the water through the day and vowed to hunt through the night to find him, after he fell off of a jetty

The community is in shock as this sort of incident is very rare for that area
