Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure has been named African Player of the Year for a record fourth time at a ceremony in Lagos.

The Ivory Coast international saw off competition from Borussia Dortmund's Gabonese forward Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Lille and Nigeria goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama to claim the honour for a fourth year in a row.

The award was confirmed by the Confederation of African Football via Twitter on Thursday evening, and Toure's club were quick to tweet their congratulations.

'Congratulations to @YayaToure, CAF African Player of the Year for the fourth successive year!' City tweeted.

Last season, Toure scored 24 goals for City, 20 of them in the Premier League as they claimed the title for the second time in three seasons.

After a turbulent summer in which Toure suffered the loss of his younger brother Ibrahim to cancer and seemed to be at odds with his club, he started the season slowly by his own standards but returned to form before heading to the African Nations Cup.

Toure scored 20 goals in the Premier League last season including this effort against Fulham in March
