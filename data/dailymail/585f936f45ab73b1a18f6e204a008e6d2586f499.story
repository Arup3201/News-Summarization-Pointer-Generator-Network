It used to be regarded as a national trait that set the English apart from more emotional nationalities.

But the stiff upper lip could be a thing of the past, it was claimed yesterday.

The ability of the English to remain stoical and visibly unmoved under pressure has been replaced by a tendency to show off our emotions in public.

The outpouring of emotion over the death of Princess Diana and watching footballers such as David Beckham and Paul Gascoigne cry on the pitch has given us licence to display our emotions for all to see, a survey suggested.

The research, commissioned by the think tank British Future, asked 2,360 people which qualities summed up the concept of being English, and which were outdated.

Fifty-one per cent of those questioned think the stiff upper lip is an ‘outdated stereotype’, while other familiar characteristics - a fondness for queuing, apologising and talking about the weather - are all still well ingrained into the English mind set.

Seventy per cent of those polled said the English sense of humour as a national attribute, while the vast majority chose talking about the weather as the most quintessentially English trait.

Sixty-nine per cent said the English were happy to queue and wait their turn, and 60 per cent described ‘saying sorry unnecessarily’ was a national trait.

British Future, which deals with ‘identity and integration’, commissioned the ICM poll ahead of a Festival of Englishness, which it will co-host with another think tank, the Institute for Public Policy Research, in London this weekend.

Sunder Katwala, director of British 
Future, said: ‘From Gazza’s tears to the public reaction to Princess 
Diana’s death... people are more happy to wear their heart on their 
sleeves.

'The Englishness 
that we’ve now got is still proud of tradition, such as Shakespeare, but
isn’t as emotionally repressed and buttoned up as it was in the past.’

More than half of those surveyed said that being happy to wait in a queue was an English trait

He continued: ‘This research shows that many of the images of what sums up being English still ring true for most people - that we talk about the weather, are happy to queue and are proud of our distinctive sense of humour, but do say sorry too much.

‘But the English also feel that we have become less buttoned up.

‘After the chilly, stiff upper lip world of Downton Abbey and Brief Encounter, this research shows that we don’t see being emotionally repressed as a valuable part of our national character.’

Mr Kutwala added: ‘We hope to put to bed the equally outdated idea that Englishness is something we can’t really talk about.

'There is much to be proud of in English history and culture, comedy and sport. We need to ditch the idea that Englishness is the one national identity that nobody’s allowed to celebrate.’

The ICM poll, which took the thoughts of more than 2,300 people, also revealed the most popular choices for the best ‘spokesman for England’.

Top of the list - which excluded politicians - was the Queen, who was in the top three choice for 57 per cent of respondents.

Next was the actor and comedian Stephen Fry with 27 per cent, while the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, was picked by 12 per cent.
