Lee Osler, pictured leaving Hull Crown Court, admitted poisoning his partner's vodka with bleach in revenge after she dumped him

A jilted boyfriend poisoned the mother of his two children at a family party in revenge for the break-up of their five-year relationship.

Lee Osler, 35, mixed 10ml of Mr Muscle bleach into Sarah Sutherland's vodka drink which she drank believing 'it tasted funny.' She put it down to a cheap orange mixer. 

The court heard he blamed Miss Sutherland, 34,for the break-up of their five-year relationship in which they had two children and told police he wanted 'revenge'.

Osler had been handing his victim the drinks spiked with bleach during the children's party, two months after their break up. 

The mother-of-two woke the day after the party with a banging headache. The following two days she fell ill suffering from diarrhea not knowing she had been deliberately poisoned.

When the truth emerged she began having panic attacks and sleepless nights.

Osler a factory agency worker, of Portobello Street, Hull, pleaded guilty to a charge of administering poison with intent to injure Sarah Sutherland under the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act and appeared for sentence at Hull Crown Court.

Principal Crown advocate Philip Evans said the couple had been in a relationship for five years until it came to an end in October 2013. Osler had to move out of the family home to live with his sister and blamed Sutherland from the break-down in their relationship.

He said they shared contact with their children Grace, 5, and Thomas, 4, but Osler - described by his partner as a loner - suffered from anxiety and depression and was referred to his doctor who advised him to seek counselling.

During the course of the first telephone conversation with a counsellor Osler admitted he had been following Sarah Sutherland with a view to finding out where she lived and who she was seeing.

'He said he had put a chemical in her drink,' said Mr Evans. 'He told her that it did not work and that she was ok. The counsellor told Mr Osler she had to report the matter to the authorities. He agreed and was subsequently arrested by Humberside Police. 

Osler was handed an eight-month jail term suspended for two years at Hull Crown Court (pictured) as well as a three year restraining order

'During the course of the police interview he said his ex-partner had a three-quarter litre bottle of vodka that was one quarter full. He said he had put 10ml of Mr Muscle bleach in her vodka. He said he did this to Sarah Sutherland as an act of revenge for the ending of the relationship when Osler went to her home for a children's party.

'Miss Sutherland recalls him pouring her vodka in a glass and he mixed it with Coca Cola. She said he then poured her a vodka and orange which she said tasted funny. She put that down to the cheap orange juice mixer. She said she recalled the peculiar taste. She recalled the next day she had a headache.

'By the Monday and Tuesday, because this happened on Saturday, she was experiencing diahorrea.'

In a victim impact statement,  Miss Sutherland said since the poisoning she had experienced panic attacks and lost her self confidence. 

Mr Evans said Miss Sutherland wanted a restraining order to keep Mr Osler away.

Defence barrister Robin Smith said: 'He accepts this was a wretched and dangerous thing to do to someone he loved and still loves. He believed the relationship did not break down because of his own problems, but that in some way it was her fault.

'He irrationally thought he should take revenge on her. He said it was not pre-planned. He is entirely remorseful. He is grateful it has not lead to more severe health problems. She recognised there was not something right with the drink but put it down to a cheap mixer. Any thoughts of a reconciliation with his partner, he recognises, are now over.

'He has not seen his children at all since the start of proceedings.'

He said had it not been for the counselling telephone call, the authorities and his ex would never have known about the poison.

Sentencing Judge David Tremberg said: 'Lee Osler, you are 35 and you have pleaded guilty to administering poison with intent to injure your former partner. It is said in the reports you are willing to accept any advice from people prepared to give it to you. Well here is a piece of advice from me: If you do anything like this again you are going to get locked up for years.'

Judge Tremberg said he accepted at the time Osler was suffering mental health problems and was at the end of a relationship. 'You put a small amount of bleach in a bottle of alcohol which you encouraged your former partner to drink. While she was not immediately affected, she woke the next day feeling poorly and suffered a stomach upset. Mercifully the physical affects were not great, but the psychological affects have been significant. She has been losing sleep and experiencing panic attacks. This is akin to causing actual bodily harm.'

He said the offence clearly crossed the custody threshold, but he had to take into account his guilty plea, that he was working, and that he was an isolated individual with no record of previous convictions.

He said: 'This is your first and last chance.' 

Osler was handed an eight-month jail term suspended for two years and  a three year restraining order banning him from contact with Ms Sutherland unless through child and family services.

He was also ordered to attend a building better relationships programme.
