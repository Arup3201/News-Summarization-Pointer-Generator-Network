When it comes to popping the question,
most women consider themselves to be lucky to be on the receiving end 
of a bended knee, bunch of flowers and a ring that fits.

But for one man, a simple declaration of love and commitment was a little tame.

Ross Doswell is in a field of his own when it comes to marriage proposals - after popping the question on a hillside using straw.

The huge 'Carly Marry Me' sign written in hay on hills at Moddbury by her doting boyfriend

Ross Doswell got a good reaction from his new fiancee Carly Richards after proposing to her with a giant sign made from hay

The romantic science graduate, 29, spelt out 'Carly Marry Me?' using huge piles of hay so big they could be seen by passing motorists.

Ross placed a blindfold on girlfriend Carly Richards, 26, a charity worker, and led her to the field next to the A379 in Modbury, Devon.

He then removed the blindfold and after she saw the huge message she quickly said 'yes'.

Ross said the hay proposal took him, father Lance and brother Scott a day to set up.

He said: 'On the day, I blindfolded Carly and led her down the road into the town centre. I then told her to take the blindfold off and look straight ahead.

Ross placed a blindfold on Carly and lead her to the field then removed the blindfold and after she saw the huge message she quickly said 'yes'

'While she did this, I went down on one knee behind her and asked the all-important question.

'Thankfully she said yes. I had a busy time trying to keep her out of the town centre before I popped the question but I managed it.'

Ross was helped with his grand proposal by Roy Lugger, the farmer who owns the land.

Ross said: 'When I decided I was going to propose that was the first idea that I thought of and couldnâ€™t get it out of my head.

The good news was sealed with a kiss by the loved-up couple, who are yet to set a date for their wedding

'I rang my dad to see if he thought it would be possible to put the sign up. As it turned out he had just finished doing some work for Mr Lugger.

'The farmer loved the idea and offered to help with it as well. It took a day to set up.'

The couple, from Modbury but now living in Leicestershire, have not yet set a date for the wedding.
