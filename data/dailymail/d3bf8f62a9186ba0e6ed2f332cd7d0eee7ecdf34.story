More than 13million families are each losing £200 a year because they are on rip-off variable rate energy tariffs, it is revealed today.

The total extra cost of these deals to families is an astonishing £2.7billion a year.

Some 60 per cent of customers with the Big Six firms – British Gas, SSE, Npower, EDF, E.ON and Scottish Power – are on standard variable tariffs, for which tiny price cuts have been announced in recent weeks.

But industry experts say that, even after the cuts, these tariffs are £200 to £250 a year more expensive than fixed rate deals available from the Big Six and smaller rivals.

And the households on these tariffs tend to be those who have been with their supplier for many years – meaning they are being penalised for their loyalty.

The details are revealed as an inquiry by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is this week expected to reveal a culture of exploitation by the Big Six firms, which are accused of failing to pass on huge falls in the wholesale cost of gas and electricity in the past year.

The £2.7billion rip-off has been estimated by the Department of Energy and Climate Change, which is today launching a 'Power to Switch' campaign to encourage people to escape these expensive tariffs.

The campaign is being backed by Martin Lewis, of financial advice website MoneySavingExpert, who said people need to wake up to the 'ugly truth' about the standard tariffs.

'We need to shout loud about the benefits of switching tariff,' he said. 'Too many people think energy firms are all the same. That's far from true, there are huge differences on both price and customer service.

The easiest way to switch is to use one of 13 price comparison websites accredited by the industry regulator Ofgem. It is possible to agree to switch in as little as five clicks on these sites.

You will need your 'annual summary', a document sent by energy firms to all customers, which includes key facts about your tariff, such as energy use over the previous 12 months in kilowatt-hours.

The switching website will ask for your current supplier and tariff, annual usage, preferred payment method and postcode. It will then show two lists of tariffs that are cheaper, highlighting the potential annual saving. The first list will be for suppliers where the comparison website can begin the switch immediately. The second list will be for the entire industry, including firms you will need to contact directly.

More information on how to switch is available at www.BeAnEnergyShopper.com or by calling the Energy Saving Advice Service on 0300 123 1234.

'The worry is that news of recent price cuts, even though they were paltry, will have given many false confidence that they're on a decent deal.

'Examine the figures and the ugly truth is very different.

'Even after price cuts, someone on a Big Six supplier standard tariff with typical use will pay £1,158 a year, whereas switch to the cheapest tariff and they'd pay just over £900 a year.' Trade association Energy UK, which represents the suppliers, said: 'New, cheaper tariffs are being launched every week, meaning that customers could save hundreds of pounds on their annual bill.

'The savings are even greater for households who haven't switched in a long time.'

Energy expert Emma Bush, from comparison website uSwitch, said: 'If more of us switched from expensive standard tariffs to cheaper deals, suppliers would work harder to attract and retain customers with lower prices and better customer service.'

The CMA investigation is expected to focus on the poor treatment of long-standing customers and to argue that the profits of the leading firms are far higher than they admit.

The companies claim their profits margins are around 5 per cent of what customers pay. But the CMA is predicted to use a different measure, which could reveal 'eye-watering' profits.

Later this week, Centrica, which owns British Gas, is set to report profits of nearly £1.6billion for 2014.

Energy secretary Ed Davey said: 'The power is in people's hands to get a better deal and save. Millions of people can switch supplier and save hundreds of pounds today.'
