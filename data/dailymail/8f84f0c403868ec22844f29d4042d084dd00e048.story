Listening to your favourite songs no longer requires you to pick up the remote or swipe your smartphone screen.

A new app, dubbed Brainwave, now lets anyone with an Android smartphone or tablet change tracks simple by waving their hands in the air.

The app, released today, uses the device’s front facing camera to follow movements from a user’s hands, allowing them to control music without ever touching their phone.

A new app, dubbed Brainwave, now lets anyone with an Android smartphone or tablet to change tracks simple by waving their hands in the air. Open hand gesture means 'play' or 'pause'. A swipe right moves you onto the next song and a swipe left takes you to the previous song

Created by Oregon-based OnTheGo Platforms, the system uses a mobile gesture recognition technology known as Ari.

‘It’s kind of like the Xbox Kinect but for a smartphone and with no added hardware,’ Ryan Fink, chief executive of OnTheGo, told MailOnline.

‘The phone has to be in landscape mode, then, you put your hand over the phone at least a foot to almost three feet away.

‘If you want to play or pause a song, you can put an open hand in front of the phone. Waving skips the song, while a wave in the other direction will take you to the previous track.

Once the user downloads BrainWave, all of their compatible music apps - including Pandora, iHeart, Spotify, Beats, Google Play - are automatically added to the apps list (left). When a user selects their preferred music player, BrainWave will automatically run in the background, working even if the screen is switched off (right)

• Gestures are recognised 1-3ft (30-90cm) away from the phone

• It uses the front-facing camera on an Android smartphone or tablet

• The app automatically adds compatible music players

• Open hand gesture means 'play' or 'pause'

• A swipe right moves you onto the next song

• A swipe left takes you to the previous song

• The app works when screen is locked and off

• It is currently compatible with Pandora, iHeart Radio, iHeart Auto and Spotify

Once the user downloads BrainWave, all of their compatible music apps - including Pandora, iHeart, Spotify, Beats, Google Play - are automatically added to the apps list.

This then allows the third party apps to be controlled with gesture recognition using the camera on the front of the Android device.

When a user selects their preferred music player, BrainWave will automatically run in the background, working even if the screen is switched off.

‘[Its accuracy] is pretty dead on,’ said Mr Fink. ‘It should work almost every single time.'In the near future, Brainwave’s creators are hoping to add gesture control that will adjust volume and like/dislike songs.

A car mode is also in development so that the app will automatically turn on when a user is driving.

The app is currently free on Google Play, and is only compatible with an Android device. An iOS version will be available in the near future.
