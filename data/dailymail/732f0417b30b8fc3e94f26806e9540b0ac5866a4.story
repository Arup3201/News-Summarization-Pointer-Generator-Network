Cristiano Ronaldo turned to the banks of photographers, stripped off his shirt, clenched his fists, struck a pose like he was the Incredible Hulk, showed off his ripped upper body and I felt like throwing up.

Ronaldo had just scored a penalty to make it 4-1 in the Champions League final in Lisbon on Saturday. It wasn’t exactly a crucial wonder goal in the dying seconds to win the game.

But he stripped and showed off his muscles because he knew it would be the image most widely used online and in the world’s newspapers. He wanted to create an image for the ‘Decima.’ Ronaldo wanted to be 'La Decima.’

It's all about him! Cristiano Ronaldo scored a late penalty and immediately stripped off in Lisbon on Saturday

Egotism taking hold: Gareth Bale will always be in the shadow of Ronaldo, who demands Real attention

Not a blind bit of difference: Ronaldo's spot kick had little consequence on the Champions League final result

The main man: The Portuguese striker wanted to be the iconic image of the Decima victory

You see, in Ronaldo’s world, it’s all about Ronaldo. And as long as he is at Real Madrid then Real Madrid will always be about Ronaldo.

He’s a great player, so you can probably forgive the size of the ego, but Ronaldo’s obsession with himself will have implications, notably for Gareth Bale.

While they are both at the Bernabeu, Bale will always be in Ronaldo’s shadow, no matter how well he plays. With CR7 in the team it’s never about the collective.

Bale wandered around after the trophy lift bouncing the ball, doing the Rambo thing with a scarf tied to his forehead, but almost a peripheral figure as the celebrations began in earnest.

This is the man who cost a world-record fee.

This is the man who scored Madrid’s best goal of the season in the Copa del Rey final against Barcelona. He also scored the goal in extra time that gave Real the lead - a lead they never relinquished.

I suspect Bale would publicly deny that he’s upset in any way about Ronaldo poking home a penalty and stealing the glory. But he’s a rare kind of footballer if his ego isn’t at least slightly wounded.

Most of us wanted to be first pick in the playground, but few of us had the honour.

After being the only pick at Tottenham for a season he’s had to lurk behind Ronaldo hoping someone sees him in his first year in Spain.

And on the night when he genuinely emerged from the shadows to claim top dog spot, Ronaldo got naked and sent the Welshman back to the shadows.

Right now, with two cups to celebrate in his first season at such a great club, Bale will be happy to let Ronaldo be the star.

But if Ronaldo continues to hog the headlines and limelight, I’d be surprised if it doesn’t become a problem at some point for Bale. Especially if like Saturday night, the story shouldn’t be about Ronaldo.

That's the one: Bale scored the important second goal for Madrid in extra time as they sealed the win
