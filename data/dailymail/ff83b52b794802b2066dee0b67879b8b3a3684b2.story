A heavily pregnant woman pleaded with her cage fighter ex-boyfriend not to kill their unborn baby as he stabbed her in the stomach five times, a jury heard.

Lauren Oliver said she was convinced her child was dead after Nicholas Leaning, 28, launched a frenzied attack to prevent her proving he was the father.

Miss Oliver told of the ordeal in video evidence played to Hull Crown Court. She said: 'I knew it was him and I knew what he was going for. He was trying to kill the baby.

'It was like he was enjoying it because he was smiling... I pleaded with him not to kill me and my baby.' 

The court heard Leaning and Miss Oliver had been in a 'great' relationship for around two years before she discovered he had rekindled a relationship with his ex-partner Lindsay Coombs.

The pair split in November last year - but Miss Oliver then discovered she was pregnant with his child. She claimed he made repeated instructions to her to abort the baby, but she refused. 

She said: 'I went to see Lindsay and she showed me pictures and messages and everything to prove they were together.

'We found out he had been with us both all along. I found out I was pregnant, and when I told him he told me to I had to go and get an abortion, but I didn't want to.

'He was nice at first saying "it's not right", but when I said I couldn't go through with it, he got mad. He said he would kick it kick it out of me if he had to.

'He said I had to get rid of it but when I wouldn't, he said he didn't want anything to do with it.'

Miss Oliver said she demanded a DNA test, but Leaning refused. She was 34 weeks pregnant and in the doorway of her home in Belton, North Lincolnshire, when the alleged attack took place.

The stabbing led to an emergency caesarean and the premature birth of her baby, who cannot be identified for legal reasons.

She said: 'He knew exactly what time I would be back - he knows my routine like clockwork.

'When I got back I unlocked the door and I was just about to open it when I felt someone jumping up on me from behind.

'I looked down and I clocked the trainers straight away. I knew they were his as we had been in a relationship for 18 months and he lived at my house.

'I felt a stab in my stomach and I tried to push him off. He stabbed me five times. I felt a massive gush of blood between my legs and I thought my baby was dead. 

Miss Oliver claimed Leaning was wearing a mask he used while training as a cage fighter during the alleged attack, as well as a dark hoodie, blue jeans and a black and red baseball cap.

She said: 'He wore all his clothes that he used to wear. I used to wash his clothes when he was working as a chimney sweep. All I could see was his eyes staring at me.

'The first stab took me down. I bent forward and then he pushed me and he was standing over the top of me.

'He was trying to get the knife in as many times as he could. I was shouting "someone help me please", and "Nick please stop it".

'Eventually he got up and ran away. It's just sick.'

Simon Waley, prosecuting, said yesterday: 'When the defendant learned of the pregnancy he had tried to persuade her to have an abortion and when she said she didn't want to, he became angry and said he didn't want to have anything to do with the child.

'He began to indicate to others that the child wasn't his and he hadn't been sleeping with Lauren for some time.

'Lauren and Lindsay had been in touch with each other and had been on friendly terms and arranged a DNA test to determine who was the father.

'He said he would not participate in such a test so Lindsay said she would allow DNA from their child to be used.'

He added: 'She was thrown in through the front doorway and fell to the floor. 

Aftermath: The stabbing led to an emergency caesarean and the premature birth of Miss Oliver's baby

'She landed on her knees just inside the door and she was pushed onto her back and she curled up into a ball trying to protect her stomach area.

'She could heard grunting as further blows were made to her stomach area. She realised now she was being stabbed.

'She was screaming, shouting his name and begging him to stop.

'He seemed almost to be smiling before stabbing her for the fifth time. He then fled from the scene.'

Following the alleged attack, Mr Waley said Lauren got up and tried to follow him before screaming for help. 

The court heard Lauren was taken to nearby Scunthorpe District Hospital where it was confirmed she had five stab wounds to her abdomen.

She underwent emergency surgery and a caesarean section to deliver her baby six weeks early. Mr Waley said 'astonishing that the baby was not harmed'.

When giving a description of her attacker to police, the prosecutor said that Lauren told them he was wearing a mask - the type Leaning wore while training as a cage fighter.

The court heard that Leaning was arrested around an hour after the incident at his home address in Scunthorpe.

Mr Waley said that he gave a number of conflicting accounts as to his whereabouts on the morning, as well as allegedly getting his father to provide him with a false alibi.

During police questioning, Leaning finally admitted being at Lauren's property where he said she had shouted at him and 'came at him with a knife'.

Mr Waley added: 'It's absurd that a 34-week pregnant Lauren launched an attack on her cage fighter ex-boyfriend and then went on to stab herself and her unborn baby five times in an act of spite against the defendant.'

Leaning denies attempted murder, attempted child destruction and wounding with intent.

The trial continues.
