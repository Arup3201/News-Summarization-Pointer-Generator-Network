The mother of a man charged with shooting and killing his stepfather before turning on her with a knife has said her son 'deserves the death penalty'.

Jennifer Cloninger said it would be 'hard to forgive' her 21-year-old son Matthew Safrit, who attacked her and her husband Nathan Cloninger near Shelby, North Carolina, U.S., on Friday.

Mrs Cloninger told U.S. news channel WSOCTV that Safrit shot his stepfather 'several times' after an argument over a borrowed car, before attacking him with a knife outside Safrit's girlfriend's house in Shelby.

Charged: Matthew Safrit is escorted into the Sheriff's office after allegedly shooting dead his step-father when they argued over a car

Attack: Safrit's mother was stabbed during the attack and says that she wants him executed

When Safrit's mother tried to hold her son back he stabbed her in the arm and 'pistol whipped' her, she said.

The 21-year-old student, of Cramerton, North Carolina, fled into the woods surrounding his girlfriend's mobile home but was arrested after reportedly being tracked down by a police sniffer dog.

'He deserves the death penalty for what he has done,' his mother told WSOC.

Mrs Cloninger, 40, said her son had borrowed his grandmother's car to visit his girlfriend Natalie Champion in Shelby on Friday afternoon.

When she and her husband Nathan, 41, arrived to take the car back she said Safrit was drunk and angry.

Mr Cloninger and Safrit got into a shouting match after the younger man thew the car keys in his mother's face and slammed the door, Mrs Cloninger told the news channel.

Jennifer Cloninger, the wife of murdered Nathan Cloninger, told news channel WSOC it would be 'hard to forgive' her son Matthew Safrit

'Nathan came to the door and banged on the door and said: "Matt your stuff is going out of the house tonight,"' she said.

But Mrs Cloninger said that as she and her husband were getting into the car Safrit came 'charging' out of the house with a gun and shot his stepfather 'several times'.

She said Safrit then went back into his girlfriend's family's mobile home before re-emerging with a knife and stabbing his stepfather in the chest and the stomach.

When Mrs Cloninger tried to intervene Safrit stabbed her in the arm and 'pistol whipped' her, she said.

Matthew Safrit, 21, is said to have struggled with depression in recent months

Safrit, who is understood to have been studying mechanics and business at North Carolina's Piedmont Community College, appeared in court on Monday facing charges including murder and assault with a deadly weapon.

'You can't take a life and apologise and think that everything is going to be okay, because it's not,' Mrs Cloninger said.

'He is my son and I love him, but it's going to be hard forgiving him.'

Safrit's girlfriend Natalie Champion said the 21-year-old had struggled with depression in recent months.

Champion, 26, who was in court for Safrit's appearance on Monday, told the Gaston Gazette he was a 'really good person' who had hoped to start his own business in the future.

She
told the Gaston Gazette Safrit had recently posted a video on his 
Facebook page that showed him destroying a car he had been working on 
with his biological father.

'That car was his pride and joy,' she said.

'He beat that car to death. That's when they should have known.'

Safrit is due back in court next month.
