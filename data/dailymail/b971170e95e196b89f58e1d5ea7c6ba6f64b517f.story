While other children might  have to be dragged kicking and screaming into the barber’s chair on their first visit, Rean Carter can hardly wait.

The five-year-old has never had his hair cut, and his golden locks tumble past his waist.

But after being mistaken for a girl, he is demanding a trip to the barber – and any tears on the day are more likely to come from his reluctant mother.

Golden locks: Rean Carter, five, has to tie his hair back in school because it is a health and safety risk. His two-year-old brother Regan has also never been to the barbers

Leeanne Smith, 30, said: ‘When Rean was born he had a lovely little curl of golden hair at the back of his head.

‘I just could never bear to get it cut, not even his fringe.

‘Now it flows all the way down his 
back to his bottom and is very beautiful and soft. When we go out he is 
often mistaken for a little girl. People say, “Isn’t she gorgeous”, but 
it has never bothered him. He just laughs.

Hair today, gone tomorrow: Rean Carter, five, will finally have his hair cut during his Easter holidays

‘It was only when he joined school and
had to have it tied back in a ponytail, for health and safety, that 
some of the other little boys began to make fun.

‘They said he could not play  with them because he looked  like a girl.

‘I’ve already cried at the thought of him having it cut, and will cry again when it actually happens.’

Miss Smith, from Hylton, Sunderland, 
said her son inherited his curls from her partner Neil Carter, 48, a 
painter and decorator. She added: ‘Rean said he wants it shorter, and 
spiky on top. The barber will be under strict instructions not to take 
too much off. There will be no use of clippers.’

Cut it out! The schoolboy from Sunderland has been teased by classmates for looking like a girl and has asked his mother Leeanne to get his hair trimmed

The youngster is raising money for 
charity by having his hair  cut, and has already collected  £82 from 
relatives, friends and classmates at Grange Park  primary school.

The money will be donated to 
Sunderland Royal Hospital children’s unit, where Rean spent a week and a
half in 2010, suffering from skin infection impetigo.

Miss Smith, who works as a party organiser, said her son’s long locks would then be donated to a cancer charity for use in wigs.
