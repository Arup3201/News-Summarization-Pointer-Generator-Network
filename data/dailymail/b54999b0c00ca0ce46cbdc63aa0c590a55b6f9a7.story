Manchester United legend Peter Schmeichel believes Louis van Gaal is the perfect man to restore the club's faded fortunes.

The former goalkeeper, who played at Old Trafford between 1991 and 1999, is an admirer of the Dutchman's courage in making decisions other managers would never take.

For example, in Holland's World Cup quarter-final with Costa Rica, Van Gaal replaced goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen with penalty specialist Tim Krul just moments before the shoot-out and his team duly prevailed on spot-kicks.

New man: Louis van Gaal was appointed new Man United manager following the disastrous David Moyes era

The Dane told the Daily Mirror: 'Van Gaal did one or two things in the World Cup which were quite noticeable and have put his name right up there. They were things no one else ever dared to do.

'So he looks to be his own man who knows exactly what he wants to do. I think we should be contending for the title again this season under him.

'He has always been someone who is at a big club like Bayern Munich and Barcelona and done good things. Hopefully he can do the same at Manchester United.'

European pedigree: Van Gaal guided Ajax to Champions League success back in 1995

Legend: Peter Schmeichel made over 300 appearances for the Old Trafford club between 1991 and 1999

 Van Gaal arrives at Old Trafford with a proven track record - he has won seven league titles in three countries and the Champions League with Ajax in 1995.

He guided Holland to third place at the World Cup in Brazil this summer before taking up his post at United.

The Dutchman favours an attack-minded 3-5-2 formation and this is likely to provide plenty of entertainment in the Premier League.

United face Valencia in their final friendly on Tuesday night before starting the season at home to Swansea City on Saturday lunchtime.
