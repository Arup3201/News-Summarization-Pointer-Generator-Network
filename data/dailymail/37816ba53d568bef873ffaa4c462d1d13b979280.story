Forget beef, us Brits have got a new have got a new favourite meat when it comes to roast dinners and even BBQs.

And it's a rather rarefied one: sales of venison have reportedly risen by 400 per cent over the last year.

The meat, derived from deer, is quickly increasing in popularity with high street supermarkets expanding their venison ranges to cater to the demand.

The game meat has increased in sales by 400 per cent in just one year

This news comes following data from market analysts, Kantar Worldpanel who found that sales of the game meat had rocketed by 413 per cent year on year, from £1.2 million in June 2013 to £6.4 million last month.

It appears that supermarkets are preparing to cater to this surge in popularity with The Grocer magazine reporting that Sainsbury's will roll out a new venison line this autumn under its Taste The 
Difference range. It has also increased the distribution of 
its venison lines which include sausages, burgers and diced steak with a
 sauce.

Tesco are also reported to have rolled out a 
seven-strong Tesco Chef's Selection range including venison burgers, 
meatballs and steaks from supplier Highland Game across the UK in April. 

Even low-cost supermarkets have jumped on the bandwagon with a venison Wellington being one of the major players in Asda's Christmas product range this year.

The meat has already been revealed as a major player in Asda's Christmas product range

Asda, which is sourcing its venison Wellington from Northern Ireland supplier Finnebrogue, said the launch reflected the increasing quality of its Christmas range and said that shoppers were looking for a 'wow factor.'

A spokesman from Asda told The Grocer: 'Finnebrogue has put itself on the map and are bringing venison to the fore but in an easy format.'

The Downpatrick-based supplier, which also make the retailer's Extra Special sausage range, has also noticed a surge in the sale of venison and as a result has ramped up production following a £3 million expansion of its facility in January.

The surge in popularity could also be down to its health benefits, boasting more protein than any other red meat. It is also much leaner than its counterparts, with a 4oz steak containing only 3g of fat compared to a beef steak that would contain 9g.

Sainsbury's supermarket told The Grocer, 'We have seen a growing customer demand for the protein, which is why our range now covers added-value venison.'
