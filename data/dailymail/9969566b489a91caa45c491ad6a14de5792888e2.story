Taken down by technology: Ion-Liviu Radita has been been jailed following a string of burglaries after a Find My iPhone app was used by police to help finally capture him

A burglar has been jailed following a string of break-ins after a Find My iPhone app was used by police to help finally capture him.

Ion-Liviu Radita broke into 11 properties over the course of just three weeks, stealing more than 100 pieces of jewellery.

In two break-ins, he left an unusual calling card by relieving himself on the homeowners' beds.

The 36-year-old's downfall came after an iPad he took from one of his victims allowed detectives to trace him to his home, in Ilford, Essex, through the Find My iPhone app the owner had installed.

A police spokesman said: 'Detectives tracked a red Nissan Primera that was seen outside one of the properties and were able to prove that it travelled to Kent at the exact time each of the 11 burglaries were committed.

'A search warrant was carried out at Raditaâ€™s property on May 30 and he was found in possession of a jewellery box with about 100 items of jewellery.

'He was arrested and charged with the offences.'

Radita, of Ilford, Essex, denied involvement, but was convicted of conspiracy to commit burglary in connection to seven raids in Dartford, Kent - five in the same part of the town in just eight days.

He had also carried out break-ins in Sevenoaks and one in Greenhithe, also in Kent.

A spokesman for Kent Police said: 'Radita stole laptops, mobile phones, cash and jewellery and in each burglary entry was gained by smashing a back door or window.

'He then placed furniture against the front door to prevent anyone entering while he carried out the burglary.

'In two of the burglaries in Dartford, both in Myrtle Road, he was found to have urinated on the bed.'

Detective Constable Bill Looker of Kent Police added: 'Radita was calculated about the way he went about these burglaries.

'He knew what he was after; laptops, electronic devices and jewellery, which are items he knew he could move on quickly and make a quick buck.

'With the help of the Find My iPhone app, we were able to tie his location down to a small number of addresses and from there it was a case of using other tools available to us such as Automatic Number Plate Recognition cameras to keep tabs and track the car we knew was being used to commit these burglaries.

'The cameras proved the car was in the area of those burglaries at that time and was seen to go back to Essex after they were committed.'

Radita, a Romanian national who lives in Eynsford Road in Ilford, was jailed for seven years.
