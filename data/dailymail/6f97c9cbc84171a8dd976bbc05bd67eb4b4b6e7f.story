Tasted freedom: Inmate Shaun Lloyd was working as a chef at The Clink, a restaurant run by prisoners, before he escaped

An inmate who worked at a 'fine dining' restaurant in a converted wing of a prison went on the run because he developed a fear of closed conditions, his mother has said.

Shaun Lloyd, 25, was working as a chef at The Clink, in Cardiff Prison - set up to help offenders become more employable - before he escaped almost a month ago.

Seven years into his jail sentence at HMP Prescoed open prison in Monmouthshire, South Wales for street robbery, Lloyd feared 'closed conditions' and longed for the outside world.

His mother Shirley Lloyd, 52, said: ‘He was going to work in The Clink and he loved it. But the going back to prison every evening was a problem for him.

‘I spoke to him on the day before he absconded and he didn't sound right on the phone. He sounded shaky.

‘He had a fear of them taking him back to closed conditions.’

Cardiff Prison won Home Office clearance last year to convert their former visitor centre into the £380,000 restaurant, an initiative to encourage prisoners not to reoffend by providing them with hospitality training. 

Diners pay up to £5.50 for entrees and £11.50 for mains from a breakfast and lunch menu at the 96-seat restaurant. Prisoners are paid £15 for a five-day working week.

It took 30 minutes to transport Lloyd to The Clink each day for work where he cooked dishes such as thyme-roasted baby beets with marinated Coley fillet.

Lloyd was due for parole in June but it is thought that the date could have been delayed after he tested positive for alcohol on his last day release.

Ms Lloyd from Adamsdown, Cardiff, said: ‘Shaun is banned from drinking alcohol but he's a 25-year-old man and probably just wanted to taste it.

‘He went back to prison, he was tested for alcohol and it showed positive.

‘His parole would have been postponed for three months or more because of that and I don't think he would have been able to cope with that much longer.’

'Hand yourself in': Ms Lloyd said she does not know where he is but appealed to him to turn himself in

Customers at The Clink must be searched before they enter the Category B jail which houses 780 inmates. They must hand in their mobile phones and are warned not to carry more than £50 cash.

Ms Lloyd appealed for her son to hand himself in.

She said: ‘I don't know where he is. Shaun if you're out there, reading this, please hand yourself in.

‘I can help you and there's people that can help you.’

The Prison Service said it does not comment on individual prisoners.

A spokeswoman said: ‘According to published data, the number of absconds from open prisons is at a record low.

‘Those who do abscond will be returned to a more secure prison and may face further charges.’

Gwent Police said the force had activated its operational plan to try and find him.

A spokesman said: ‘There may be a potential risk due to the fact that Lloyd is no longer in the custody of the prison service.

‘It is thought he could be in the Cardiff area where he has contacts.’

The
restaurant employs about 24 chefs and waters, as well as cleaners, with
the hope that prisoners, once released, are employable in luxury hotels
and restaurants instead of resorting to low paid work.

So far, 85 prisoners have been or are currently training at the restaurant with 25 ex-inmates successfully gaining full time employment upon jail release.

The restaurant is the brain child of 
Alberto Crisci, an award-winning chef who worked at Mirabelle Restaurant
in Mayfair, London.
