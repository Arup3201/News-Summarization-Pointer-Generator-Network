The daughter of revered former NSW premier Neville Wran has been remanded in custody on murder charges after a very brief hearing in a Sydney court on Wednesday.

Harriet Wran was due to face court by video link from jail over a double stabbing at a notorious housing commission unit block in Redfern in August.

The 26-year-old was believed to be high on ice when she and 35-year-old boyfriend Michael Lee along with another man, Lloyd Edward Haines, 29, allegedly stabbed a man to death during a drug deal.

Wran, 26, and the two men burst into a housing commission flat in the inner city Sydney suburb of Redfern on the night of Sunday, August 10 and allegedly murdered Daniel McNulty, a musician who had been operating as a drug dealer.

But Wran was not required to appear on screen by video link from Silverwater Women's Correctional Centre on Wednesday.

Her co-accused, former boyfriend Michael Lee who is in Long Bay jail, also did not show his  face on screen in court.

Magistrate Les Mabbutt adjourned the matter until a week before Christmas to allow the prosecution to get the post-mortem report on murder victim, Daniel McNulty, as well as forensic reports, handwriting analysis, video evidence and medical reports on Brett Fitzgerald, who suffered knife wounds in the attack.

Wran will be held behind bars until at least December 18.

Wran, who is understood to have been suffering from a methamphetamine addiction for months, was believed to be so desperate to score drugs she acted as 'a door girl' to help gain entry to the squalid apartment, where a fight broke out with Mr McNulty, who was stabbed twice and died from the wounds.

Another man inside the flat, Brett Fitzgerald, was stabbed several times, but was taken to hospital and survived.

Wran, Haines and Lee were each charged with murder, attempted murder and aggravated break and enter.

Wran was detained  and is believed to have been in custody in maximum security Silverwater Women's Correctional Centre.

Her barrister Winston Terracini SC said during a court appearance in August that she would be pleading not guilty to the charges.

Harriet Wran is the daughter of arts executive Jill Wran and Neville Wran, a charismatic barrister who  was the premier of NSW between 1976 and 1986, and one of the most revered political figures in the state labor party.

Mr Wran died in late April after a long period battling dementia. 

Harriet Wran, who enjoyed a private girls' school education and stands to inherit part of her father's $40 million fortune, is said to have relapsed into drugs following his May 1 funeral and was said to have been living rough in Redfern at the time of the alleged offences.

She and her co-accused Michael Lee will appear at Central Local Court on Wednesday,with Haines due in the same court on Thursday.
