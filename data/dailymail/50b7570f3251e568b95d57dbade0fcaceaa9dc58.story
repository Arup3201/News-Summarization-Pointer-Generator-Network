A mother who was left horrified by her size in festive photographs is looking forward to a slimmed down Christmas this year after losing an incredible five stone.

Kelly Jo Hearsey, from Calvert Green, Buckinghamshire, had ballooned to a size 18 after years of gorging on takeaways, chocolate, crisps and sandwiches.

But after she was left humiliated by a picture of herself tucking into her turkey dinner last year, Kelly became determined to become healthy, shedding a third of her body weight in just 12 months.

Kelly Jo Hearsey has dropped five dresses sizes and lost a third of her body weight

It was this photo, taken by Kelly's husband Glen, that inspired her to change her diet and shed the pounds

As a vegetarian mother-of-two, Kelly had been stuffing herself with carbs and cheese, eventually tipping the scales at nearly 15 stone. 

But when she saw the snap, taken by her husband Glen, 41, she said it made her feel sick. In fact, Kelly revealed that when she looked at it she decided to make the most important New Year's resolution of her life.

Since then she has dropped a whopping five dress sizes and lost a third of her weight - now weighing in at a healthy 9 stone 10lbs.

And this year she is preparing to tuck in on Christmas Day with Glenn and kids Jay, 12, and Millie, 10, in full festive spirit.

Kelly, a professional photographer went from an 18 to a tiny size 8 after just six months on a food replacement diet.

She said: 'Every time I saw a photograph of myself I felt fat and ashamed. I always shied away from the camera.

Kelly says she felt guilty and ashamed when she would see herself in shop windows, she is now a slim size 8

'When my husband showed me the Christmas dinner picture I felt horrible. I decided I needed a whole new mindset when it came to food.'

She added: 'I used to walk past shop windows, glimpse my reflection and feel a huge wave of shame, guilt, horror and loathing.

'Now I have to do a double take and still can't believe it's me, I can't get enough of looking in the mirror. 

Kelly followed the Ideal Weight diet and believes her husband now fancies her more after shifting the pounds

Kelly revealed she couldn't bear to see how she looked in front of the camera

'I've have had to buy a whole new wardrobe for myself, it feels amazing to try and clothes and find they just fit so easily.

The Ideal Weight diet works on the idea that there is not one ideal weight for everyone. 

You go to the Ideal Weight team and specify the weight loss you would like to achieve and they create a plan especially for you. 

There are different plans including the 4 plan - a kickstarter where you fast on 600 calories a day for four days.

There is also a maintenance plan for when you have lost the weight and wish to keep it off which is based around eating 1400-1600 calories a day.  

'My husband has always been so supportive of me, and has never really known me a different size, but I think he finds me more attractive now, though he'd never say it.'

Kelly followed the Ideal Weight diet - which includes eating nutrition packs such as milkshakes, soups, meals and bars as replacements for meals.

She now just has one regular healthy meal in the evening which include low-carb salads and lots of veg.

Kelly, who loves cooking Christmas dinner for her family, said she won't be holding back on Christmas Day.

She said: 'It's been so long since I've been this slim and I'm at the stage where I have to maintain the weight.

'But I'm going to enjoy Christmas this year and I won't hold back, I really enjoy the time of year.

'My stomach has shrunk and I can't eat the way I used to now and I'll go back on the diet in the new year just to get back to where I was again.'

This year Kelly will still be tucking into her Christmas dinner but will be going back to her diet in the New Year
