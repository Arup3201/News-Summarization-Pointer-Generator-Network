In custody: Mugshot of Caleb 'Kai the Hitchhiker' McGillvary, 24, taken after his arrest in Philadelphia

A homeless man known as 'Kai the hatchet-wielding hitchhiker', who was arrested for bludgeoning a lawyer to death, will be extradited to New Jersey to face charges, it emerged today.

Canada native Kai, 24, whose real name is Caleb Lawrence McGillvary, spoke from Curran-Fromhold correctional facility in Philadelphia via video conference, where he waived his right to extradition. 

The judge revoked his bail and ordered he be extradited to New Jersey, where he is accused of murdering 73-year-old lawyer Joseph Galfy Jr in Union County, earlier this month.

Kai became an Internet celebrity after he thwarted a deadly attack on a California woman with the help of his hatchet in February. 

But despite appearances on Jimmy Kimmel and an immediate fan base, his hero status quickly disintegrated after he was accused of murdering Joseph Galfy at his home after they met in Times Square.

Galfy's body was found two days later. Their earlier encounter was caught on surveillance video.

The 73-year-old was found severely beaten and wearing only his underwear and socks by police, who went to his home to check on his well-being.

Statements posted on McGillvary's Facebook page following the homicide indicated the encounter was sexual in nature.

On his Facebook page, McGillvary's last post before he was arrested said: 'What would you do? if you awoke in a stranger's house and found you'd been drugged and sexually assaulted.'

One friend who commented suggests 'hitting him with a hatchet' – and McGillvary's final comment on the post said: 'I like your idea.'

Photos and a YouTube video from early March show the 24-year-old vagrant getting an elaborate tattoo on his right cheek which helped police apprehend him after a Starbucks barrista recognized it and told police.

Disturbing twist: 'Kai the hatchet welding hitchhiker,' whose real name is Caleb Lawrence McGillvary, is accused of killing a man just months after he was hailed as a hero for saving three people from a crazed man

Since McGillvary's much-publicized 
capture, his friends have organized an online fundraising campaign to 
help him with the legal fees.

The effort is being spreadheaded by Terry Ratliff, from Georgia, who described himself as a 'personal friend' of McGillvary. 

Ratliff
created a page on the site gofundme.com with a goal to collect 
$3million for his bail. But it looks like the 24-year-old's supporters 
are facing an uphill battle as donations did not pour in as expected.

'Did
he mean to kill the guy?...Who knows, 'Ratliff wrote on the site. 'All I
know is that its an extremely unfortunate incident for a good person to
find themselves in.'

Long road ahead: Terry Ratliff, McGillvary's friend from Georgia, launched a fundraising effort on the site gofundme.com hoping to collect $3million in donations for the murder suspect's legal fees

McGillvary, better known on YouTube and Facebook as Kai
Lawrence, Caleb Kai Lawrence and Kai Nicodemus, became an instant Internet celebrity
in February when he was featured on a California news report for saving three people
from 54-year-old Jett Simmons McBride by hitting him on the head with a
hatchet.

The homeless hitchhiker, who describes himself as 'homefree,'
was riding in a passenger seat with McBride when he said the man started making
racist comments and calling himself Jesus Christ.

The incident culminated with the out-of-control driver slamming
into a black utility worker and pinning him against his truck.

He then
allegedly attacked two women who came to the aid of the victim, at which point
McGillvary jumped into action and hit the assailant over the head with a
hatchet he had on him. 

Celebrity: McGillvary (left) became an Internet sensation in February after giving an interview about his hatchet heroics, and he was even invited by late-night host Jimmy Kimmel (right) to appear on his show

McGillvary, sporting long shaggy hair tied with a bandanna,
later described his heroics in a hilarious, profanity-laced stream-of-consciousness
interview that instantly went viral online.

Since the February incident, the 24-year-old self-described
surfer dude has been regularly writing about his adventures on the road on his
Facebook page under the user name 'Caleb Kai Lawrence Yodhehwawheh.

According to his Facebook page, Galfy was a founding partner
at the Rahway law firm Kochanski, Baron Galfy, P.C.    

Galfy's neighbors said the 73-year-old had been living alone
since his long-time partner died five years prior.

According to Galfy's obituary, he served in the Army from 1965 to 1970 as a major, and got his Juris Doctor degree from Seton Hall University.

Galfy served as the attorney for the Planning Board in Green Brook, and in his free time played in a wedding band for 25 years.

Wanted man: Police said McGillvary had cut his hair to change his appearance and while on the run was considered armed and dangerous
