A former IRA member whose taped interviews played a crucial part in the arrest of Gerry Adams has said he fears for his life as tensions grow in Northern Ireland.

Anthony McIntyre's series of interviews with former comrades cast the Sinn Fein leader into the frame for one of the most notorious murders of the Northern Ireland Troubles.

Adams was arrested on Wednesday in connection with the 1972 death of Jean McConville.

The Police Force of Northern Ireland were, in part, compelled to turn their attention to Adams as a result of the Boston College Belfast Project.

Mr McIntyre led the team responsible for interviewing dozens of former IRA members, creating an oral history of the Troubles from the mouths of those who took part in violent loyalist and republican armed campaigns.

Anthony McIntyre said he fears for his life as tensions mount following the arrest of Gerry Adams. Mr McIntyre was the lead researcher on a project with Boston College, where former IRA members gave testimonies, on the proviso the recordings would not be released until after their deaths

But 10 tapes were secured by the Police Service of Northern Ireland after a landmark U.S. ruling, leaving those who took part fearing for their safety as republicans lash out labeling them 'Boston College Touts' and 'In-former Republicans' in graffiti across west Belfast

Those who opened up and revealed their parts, did so on the proviso that none of the interviews were to be released until after their deaths.

But a landmark legal judgement in the US supreme court resulted in Boston College being forced to hand over 10 taped interviews.

The tapes included information about the kidnapping, killing and burial of Ms McConville.

They are believed to name Adams as an IRA commander involved in the decision that she be killed and secretly buried for being an informer.

Adams denies any involvement in the murder and says he was never a member of the IRA.

His arrest led to growing tensions in Northern Ireland this week. His detention threatens to undermine his party Sinn Fein's support for policing in the region.

That threat could endanger the power-sharing settlement in Northern Ireland, it is feared.

In a highly inflammatory outburst, his 
deputy Martin McGuinness threatened to withdraw republican support for 
the police if the Sinn Fein president had been charged with ordering the
 abduction and killing of Jean McConville in 1972.

The move would have devastating consequences for security and stability in the province, where police officers were routinely shot by IRA terrorists before the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.

Mr McIntyre told the Observer's Henry MacDonald: 'The hate has been ratcheted up since the Adams' arrest.'

He is no stranger to protests outside 
his home.

Following the publication of Voices From The Grave by 
journalist Ed Moloney in 2010 he said excrement was smeared across the 
house next door to his.

The book included a tape from the former hunger striker Brendan Hughes.

It included allegations that Adams gave the order that Ms McConville 'disappear' for allegedly being a British army agent.

Hughes also claimed that Adams set up a covert IRA unit called the Unknowns, given the task of weeding out informers during the 1970s.

In the face of mounting tension Mr McIntyre has been critical of Boston College, claiming he feels they were not fully invested in protecting those who agreed to take part in the controversial project.

He said: 'Its lack of resolve has put both me and the research participants in a position that is close to precarious.'

He said Mr McGuiness has accused the participants of working with the Police Service of Northern Ireland, while Sinn Fein's former publicity director Danny Morrison has reportedly been labelling them informers.

Police officers used a UK-U.S. Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty, to argue they were entitled to examine those tapes which discussed Ms McConville's murder.

A Boston College spokesman said they did all they could to oppose the subpoena.

He said: 'Once the U.S. federal courts issued their final decision, Boston College had no choice but to comply.'
