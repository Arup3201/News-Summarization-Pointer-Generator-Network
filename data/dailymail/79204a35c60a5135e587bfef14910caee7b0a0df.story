Diane Sheridan got more than she bargained for during a shopping trip yesterday - when her romantic boyfriend proposed to her via a huge 23ft TV screen.

Ms Sheridan 26, was at the Intu Braehead shopping centre in Glasgow with her partner when a video of her daughter Lilly was broadcast to shoppers.

Then her partner Tony Moore, 43, appeared on the huge 23ft by 13ft screen, went down on one knee and popped the question.

Diane Sheridan and her now fiance Tony Moore, from Glasgow, celebrate their engagement with a kiss

Mr Moore surprised his partner Diane Sheridan by playing a video of the proposal on a shopping mall's giant TV screen at Intu Braehead mall, in Glasgow. Fortunately, she said yes to the proposal

He had taken her along to the shopping mall after telling her he had won a prize in a competition which he needed to collect.

Family members including aunts, and uncle were also hiding nearby after finding out about the proposal plans only days before.

And as they were waiting to collect the 'prize' Tony's video flashed up on screen.

She said: 'I thought what the hell is going on here? I kind of smelt a rat.

'I thought it seemed a bit much for a competition. Then I saw Lilly on screen and I wondered how they managed to get those images because she was dressed differently.

'I was shocked, I can be quite shy sometimes. I saw family members nearby when we were waiting so I thought something might be up.'

She looked speechless as she saw her partner on the big screen before he got down on one knee on screen to present a sparkling diamond ring.

The engagement ring Tony Moore bought his partner - which she happily accepted

The couple, pictured after their engagement at Intu Braehead mall, have been together for two-and-a-half years

The couple have been together for two-and-half-years and he had been planning to propose for a while.

The driver for Marks and Spencer's said: 'I've been thinking about it for quite a wee while but I couldn't afford to get a ring at the time.

'I wasn't planning something as big as this and I was worried about how she would react.

'I just thought about what I wanted to do for a while.

'The video was brilliant and I couldn't wait for it to be shown on the big screen.

'I liked the idea of proposing in the video because as well as being very unusual, it was also quite personal.

'Diane knows every time I do something I like to push the boat out and don't do things low-key.'

Mr Moore also has a 10-year-old stepson, Declan who was at Braehead to see the unusual proposal alongside their daughter Lily.

The full-time mum - who said yes - said the pair would celebrate with a few glasses of champagne to get over the shock.

She said: 'We're definitely going to have a glass of bubbly - or maybe a few bottles to get over the shock.'

The proposal video was played yesterday afternoon in between the latest music videos, news bulletins and adverts normally shown on the screen.

In the video, he said: 'Hi Diane, surprise! Bet you weren't expecting to see me here.

'I told you a wee bit of a lie on Monday when I said I was going to see the mortgage adviser.

'I was over in Braehead making this video and I feel as if it's time now, we have been together for a wee while - yourself, Declan and now we have got beautiful Lilly.

'I want to do this - will you marry me Diane? Please say yes.'

Assistant marketing manager for intu Braehead, Christine Macdonald said: 'I'm sure Diane won't forget this shopping trip in a hurry and we wish the happy couple all the very best for the future.'
