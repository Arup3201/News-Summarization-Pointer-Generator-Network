Tragic: Kenneth Bellando, 28, was found dead in an apparent suicide on March 12

An investment banker has been found dead in an apparent suicide in Manhattan's Upper East Side.

Kenneth Bellando's death is the latest in a spate of suicides by finance professionals both around the globe and in New York.

He was found dead in a neighboring backyard after jumping off his six-story building at around 10.20pm on Wednesday March 12.

Police investigators told MailOnline that the case is still technically under investigation but there was no immediate suspicion of foul play and he was dead on arrival.

Bellando, 28, worked at Levy Capital Partners and was previously an investment bank analyst at JP Morgan and Paragon Capital Partners.

He was raised in Long Island before attending and graduating from Georgetown University in D.C.

He returned to New York after graduation and launched his career in finance.

Kenneth was not the only one in the family to work in the business world.

Latest: Kenneth, a Georgetown University graduate, is the 12th finance professional to kill himself this year

His father John Bellando is chief operating officer and chief financial officer at Conde Nast- and is listed just below famed editor Anna Wintour on the magazine company's executive team bio page.

The New York Post reports that Kenneth's brother John worked at JPMorgan as the bank's chief information officer.

Because of his role and involvement in risk exposure valuations, some of John Bellando's emails were used as evidence in the Senate Finance Committee's hearings about the 2012 'London Whale' trading scandal.

Kenneth's friends have begun posting photos and condolences on his Facebook page since his March 12 death, including some of Kenneth posing with his two sisters.

His death came the day after another banker killed himself by jumping in front of a commuter train in Long Island.

So far this year, there have been nine other apparent suicides by people who work in various financial roles around the globe, making Bellando's death the 11th in two and a half months.

Bellando is the youngest of the deaths, having only graduated from college in 2007.
