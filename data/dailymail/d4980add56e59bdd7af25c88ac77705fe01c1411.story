House Majority leader John Boehner has rented his DC apartment from a tanning bed lobbyist.

The perpetually-tan Republican from Ohio has repeatedly denied that he has ever gone to a tanning salon.

It has long been known for years that Boehner has rented his two bedroom basement apartment in DC from John Milne, a lobbyist.

Now it has been revealed that one of the groups that Milne represents is the American Suntanning Association.

The Daily Caller reported the connection between Milne and the tanning booth group but Boehner's ties to Milne were originally reported by The Washington Post in 2006 when he was the House Majority leader and President George W. Bush was in office.

At the time, Boehner's spokesman stressed that though Boehner had known Milne's wife, Debra Anderson, since the 1990s, their friendship had never been used to enhance his lobbying interests.

'John Milne does not lobby John Boehner on any issue and has not lobbied him on any issue during the time period in which John has been renting the property,' Boehner's then-spokesman Don Seymour told The Post in 2006.

One of the new high-profile clients that Milne has taken on since then was the American Suntanning Association, and they hired Milne’s company, mCapitol, to represent them for $90,000 earlier this year.

They undoubtedly wanted the company to fight for their interests when it was revealed that the Affordable Care Act includes a proposed 10 per cent sales tax against tanning beds.

In reference to the newfound, Milne told The Daily Caller that there has never been any salon-style bed in the house where Boehner rents.

'There is not nor has there ever been a tanning bed in the residence!' Milne wrote in an email.

In spite of Boehner's unseasonable complexion- and this new connection to tanning enthusiasts- he has repeatedly denied ever using such a contraption to get his unusual glow.

This is not the first time that Milne and Boehner have had overlapping interests as mCapitol has represented a number of clients in the restaurant industry. They would have been especially interested in the Small Business Tax Fairness Act- of which Boehner was one of the co-sponsors.

Though Boehner’s spokesman may deny the role their personal relationship has influenced whatever work they have done together, those connections are a major selling point for the company itself.

‘At mCapitol Management, we specialize in forging business and government relationships for our clients,’ the company’s website states.
