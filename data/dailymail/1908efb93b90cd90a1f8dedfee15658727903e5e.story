Almost a fifth of casualty departments are being left entirely in the hands of junior doctors at night, an alarming report by the body which represents A&E doctors reveals.

The A&E units have no consultants or any other senior doctors present overnight and are instead run by medics with a few months’ experience.

The report, by the College of Emergency Medicine, warned that A&E units are ‘facing their biggest challenge in well over a decade’ due to ‘unsustainable workloads’ and a shortage of high-level doctors.

A new report says junior doctors are in charge of fifth of all A&E units overnight

Already there is mounting concern that hospital emergency departments are in crisis and struggling to cope with soaring numbers of patients.

Last week a senior doctor called them a ‘war zone’ as they were increasingly overwhelmed with patients let down by GP out-of-hours services, a rise in the frail, ageing population, and problems caused by the new 111 non-emergency service with patients wrongly referred to A&E by untrained call centre staff.

A report today by the college shows there is a gap of eight hours overnight where no consultants are present at any units in the country. And in almost a fifth – 17.5 per cent – there are no ‘middle grade’ doctors, the level in between consultants and juniors.

The report also showed that blunders such as scalpels being left inside patients which are known as ‘never events’ – because they should never happen – occurred in 6 per cent of all A&E units last year.

The college examined the staffing levels, admissions and waiting times at 131 emergency departments in Britain.

Dr Taj Hassan, vice president of the college and an A&E consultant at Leeds Teaching hospital, warned: ‘Because of the pressures we have there is no doubt that we have an increasing number of units that at times probably are unsafe or where they have serious safety issues.’ He said the lack of senior medics overnight was partly due to a national shortage of A&E doctors, with many regarding the job as ‘highly stressful’.

Dr Hassan added: ‘There is a steady move in the NHS towards improving the amount of time consultants are present but obviously that can’t happen immediately.

‘We have to create sustainable and safe working practices which are attractive to future trainees.’

There are 22million admissions to A&E units each year, a rise of nearly 60 per cent in the past decade. The report says between 15 and 30 per cent of patients going to A&E could be seen by GPs.

Katherine Murphy, of the Patients Association, blamed the crisis in A&E on a ‘complete lack of faith’ in local GP out-of-hours services, ‘exacerbated by the complete erosion of public confidence in the NHS 111 service’.

Labour health spokesman Jamie Reed said: ‘It has come to something when A&E doctors issue statements like this.’

A government review of A&E units and out-of-hours GP care is expected to report this summer. Last month Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said that since family doctors had been allowed to stop working evenings and weekends, an extra four million patients were attending casualty each year.

Many areas outsource out-of-hours care to private firms which have been accused of putting profits before patient safety.

This week the Mail revealed how the largest of these companies, Harmoni, was using nurses instead of doctors to cover districts with up to 250,000 patients.
