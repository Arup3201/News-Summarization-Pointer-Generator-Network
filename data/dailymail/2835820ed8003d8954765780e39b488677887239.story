The oldest ever traces of olive oil have been unearthed of shards of ancient pottery in Israel.

Archaeologists unearthed the 8,000-year-old fragments at Ein Zippori, an Early Bronze Age town in the Lower Galilee.

Analysis of the pots revealed traces of the plant oil remarkably similar to modern versions, researchers said.

Ianir Milevski and Nimrod Getzov of the Israel Antiquities Authority sampled the vessels to reveal what was stored in them and how they were used by the site’s ancient inhabitants.

‘Although it is impossible to say for sure, this might be an olive species that was domesticated and joined grain and legumes – the other kinds of field crops that we know were grown then.

‘Those crops are known from at least 2,000 years prior to the settlement at Ein Zippori. With the adoption of olive oil the basic Mediterranean diet was complete.

‘From ancient times to the present, the Mediterranean economy has been based on high quality olive oil, grain and must, the three crops frequently mentioned in the Bible,' they said in a statement.

The society using the oil was pre-Jewish and practiced a pagan religion revolving around the worship of fertility.

Olive oil has a very long history of religious symbolism. 

An enormous number of references to olive oil can be found in the religious writings of Judaism, Christianity and Islam as well as in the sacred texts of Ancient Egypt, Greece and Rome.

The olive tree has long been understood as a symbol of  life, renewal, resilience, and peace.

The oil symbolises purity, protection, health and light.

‘We have no writing during that period so we know little about them. We do not know what language they spoke but we assume it was an early Semitic language, from which Babylonian and Akkadian evolved and later also Hebrew and Arabic,’ Milevski said.

On the same site archaeologists found stone palettes with engravings of female figures with animals around them, reported The Times of Israel.

They also found bones from the limbs of large animals engraved with images of eyes, trees and triangles symbolizing the female sex.

Of the 20 pottery vessels sampled, two were found to be particularly ancient, dating to approximately 5,800 BCE.

Researchers said the findings (pictured) went hand in hand with recent finds at Kfar Samir, a 7,700-year-old site now underwater off the coast of Haifa, where the oldest evidence of olive oil production was discovered

The researchers said the findings went hand in hand with recent finds at Kfar Samir, a 7,700-year-old site now underwater off the coast of Haifa, where the oldest evidence of olive oil production was discovered.

‘Now at Zippori, evidence has been found for the first time of the use of olive oil. Together with the Kfar Samir discovery, this is the earliest evidence of olive oil production in the country, and possibly the entire Levant (the Mediterranean basin),’ researchers added.

It is not known whether the oil was used as a food or as lighting or both. 

The findings were published in the Israel Journal of Plant Sciences.
