Deciding where to place a Wi-Fi router at home to minimise signal blackspots is a fine art.

But a physicist has attempted to tackle the problem by mathematically working out the optimum position for a router.

He studied how walls and reflections affected signal strength and concluded that, as common sense might suggest, there’s just no beating the centre of a house for router location.

Jason Cole at Imperial College London simulated Wi-Fi router locations (shown above in the diagram of Mr Cole's flat). He found that the best location, as common sense might suggest, was in the centre of a home. He had grown frustrated after finding blackspots in his flat

The 'complex' research was carried out by Jason Cole, a PhD physics student at the John Adams Institute at Imperial College London.

Wi-Fi signals use very low intensity radio waves. Whilst similar in wavelength to domestic microwave radiation, the intensity of Wi-Fi radiation is 100,000 times less than that of a domestic microwave oven.

The type of radiation emitted by radio waves (Wi-Fi), visible light, microwaves and mobile phones has been shown to raise the temperature of tissue at very high levels of exposure - but that's much higher than what people are subjected to on a regular basis.

This is called a thermal interaction, but researchers are divided as to whether the radiation we receive daily can cause damage.

The UK Health Protection Agency (HPA) has been monitoring the safety of Wi-Fi. It says people using Wi-Fi, or those in the proximity, are exposed to the radio signals it emits - and some of the transmitted energy in the signals is absorbed in their bodies.

However, the signals are very low power. Sitting in a Wi-Fi hotspot for a year results in receiving the same dose of radio waves as making a 20 minute mobile phone call. 

Frustrated at finding numerous Wi-Fi blackspots around his flat, Mr Cole turned to mathematics to find out how he could improve his internet connection.

The detailed research can be seen in his initial study and a more in-depth follow-up.

Using something known as the Helmholtz equation, which can resolve physical problems in both space and time, Mr Cole simulated his flat in a program called Matlab.

In the simulation he mapped out his flat and then created a virtual router and computer.

He then tested out what happened to the router’s signal when it was placed in different locations around his flat.

He found that, when confined to one side of the flat, the waves were hindered not only by walls and closed doors but also when they went around corners.

This, he says, is because the signal loses strength when it bounces off objects.

‘I suspected that the thick Victorian walls were absorbing the radiation or scattering it away from my computer,’ Mr Cole tells MailOnline.

‘I found an equation which approximates the behaviour of high-frequency electromagnetic waves such as Wi-Fi, and tried to solve it by placing a virtual router in the floor plan of my flat.

‘After crunching numbers for a few minutes I was able to generate maps of Wi-Fi signal strength inside the flat, showing poor signal near my computer.

‘I can now test putting the router in different positions to improve the situation.’

Walls, doors and corners were found to greatly decrease signal strength (shown). Mr Cole found there was no substitute for direct line-of-sight to the router, especially when it was place at one side of his flat. The simulations were created in a program called Matlab

In order to get the best signal strength around a home, Mr Cole says nothing beats placing the router at the centre (simulation shown). While he has yet to test the simulations in real life yet, some commenters on his website suggested he tape an antenna to a robot vacuum cleaner

By showing how weakened the signal can be when it moves across the flat, Mr Cole found that no matter where his router was placed at one side of the flat, there would always be blackspots elsewhere.

Instead, he suggests that the only solution to ensure as few blackspots as possible is to place the router in the middle of the flat.

‘It turned out that the model I developed was very sensitive to every little detail, so it was difficult to say other than the common sense advice: direct line-of-sight to the router is best,’ he explains.

‘There is also some reflection of the signal around corners, but engineers tell me reflections are bad too.

‘In my case, the best position was as central as possible, preferably near open doorways.’

He says he hasn’t tried any physical tests of the simulation yet, but has been given suggestions by commenters on his website.

‘Some inspired online commenters have suggested taping an antenna to a robot vacuum cleaner and letting it sniff around the flat,’ he says.

‘There have been many other helpful comments which will no doubt improve the methodology in the future, and a surprising number of people asking for an app to test their own houses or offices, so there's plenty of work to do.’
