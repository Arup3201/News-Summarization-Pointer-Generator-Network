A Palestinian lured an Israeli soldier
 to a village in the West Bank and killed him with the intention of 
trading the body for his jailed brother, Israel's intelligence agency claims.

The Palestinian man was arrested and confessed to the killing, the Shin Bet intelligence agency have said.

The soldier was reported missing yesterday and Israeli forces began looking for him.

Loss: Israeli soldiers carry the body of a fellow soldier killed in the north of the occupied West Bank, near the town of Qalqilyam after Palestinian Nidal Ammar reportedly confessed to the killing and led them to the body

The search led the troops to Nidal Amar, a 42-year-old Palestinian from Beit Amin a village near the city of Qalqiliya in the northern West Bank.

Amar told the Shin Bet that he had killed the soldier, who he knew because they had worked together at a restaurant in the coastal city of Bat Yam in central Israel, the agency said.

According to Shin Bet, the Palestinian recounted how he had picked up the soldier in a taxi on Friday after convincing him to accept a ride.

They claim that after talking the soldier into joining him, Amar took the Israeli to an open field, killed him and hid his body in a well.

Israeli forces raided Amar's home early on Saturday based on intelligence information, and interrogated him and his brother.

They claim Amar confessed to intending to trade the soldier's body for another brother, who has been in an Israeli jail since 2003 for his role in several terror attacks.

Amar then led Israeli forces to where the body was hidden this afternoon and was arrested.

It is sadly not the first case of Palestinians abducting Israeli soldiers, sometimes killing them afterward and the military has a long standing campaign warning soldiers not to accept rides from strangers.

It's still unknown how Amar convinced the soldier to join him on the ride Friday.

The killing could deal a new blow to 
U.S.-led Mideast peace efforts, which resumed in July after a nearly 
five-year break in Israel-Palestinian talks.

The
 deaths of several Palestinians in Israeli arrest raids in the West Bank
 intended to detain militants involved in attacks have further soured 
the atmosphere between the two sides.

In 2001 a Palestinian woman lured an Israeli teenage boy over the Internet to the West Bank where he was murdered by waiting Palestinian militants.

The woman, Amna Muna, was released along with over a thousand other Palestinian prisoners in exchange for a single Israeli soldier held captive in Gaza by Hamas-allied militants in 2011.

The West Bank has been under Israeli military occupation since 1967.
