Oral Bryan denies murdering his ex-partner and the mother of two of his children, Nicola McKenzie, (pictured) with a hockey stick during a row last year

A father-of-five murdered his ex-partner in front of their children by hitting her across the head with a hockey stick 'like an axe', a court has heard.

Nicola McKenzie, 37, was allegedly killed by her ex-partner Oral Bryan during a row in the street on September 17 last year.

She suffered serious head injuries after he swung the hockey stick 'like an axe' and hit her with 'severe force' - she died two days later.

Bryan, 44, of Moss Side, Manchester, denies murder and told police he acted in self-defence.

Manchester Crown Court heard yesterday that the fatal incident took place after Ms McKenzie turned up at Mr Bryan's home, where she was allegedly 'abusive and aggressive' to another woman with whom he had three children.

All five children were present when 'devoted mother' Ms McKenzie was knocked unconscious by Bryan. 

Opening the case, prosecutor Mark Kellet described how in the moments before she was hit, a passing postman heard Ms McKenzie say to Bryan: 'These are your kids, go on, show them what you're like.'

The court heard Bryan then turned around and walked back to his house before returning with the hockey stick.

Mr Kellet said: 'The witness could hear the lady who must be Nicola shouting, "go on, hit me, I want you to hit me."

'That's exactly what the defendant did, striking a single blow across the head, causing her to fall to the floor on the road.'

Following his arrest, Bryan told police 'I didn't mean to hurt her'.

He said that Ms McKenzie attacked him with a knife and that he struck the fatal blow accidentally as he tried to disarm her with the hockey stick.

But Mr Kellet said no knife was recovered from the scene and that none of the witnesses saw one.

Mr Kellet told the jury: 'You will be sure that rather than jabbing or flicking at Nicola to disarm her, Nicola wasn't in possession of a knife and there wasn't a jab or flick - this was a hockey stick raised, brought down with severe force, knocking her unconscious.

'The location, the nature of the laceration, swelling, bleeding, bruising and nerve damage to the brain is all consistent with a blow of severe force, as described by all the witnesses.

'This was an unlawful assault striking a violent blow and at the time of striking this blow the defendant must have intended to cause at the very least really serious harm.

'Consequently, the Crown say having heard the evidence you will be sure the defendant is guilty of murder.'

Following her death last year daughter Teja and son Amahri described Ms McKenzie as a 'devoted mother'.  

The case continues. 

The incident occurred on this quiet residential street in Moss Side, Manchester on September 14, 2014
