It is pointless asking Steven Gerrard where it all goes wrong. Gerrard is where it all goes wrong.

Not just in this tournament, not just with the odd mistake of a player raging against the dying of the  light, but from the very start, from his earliest days as an international footballer.

All those times when we looked and wondered what happened to the Gerrard we knew, the one in the red shirt, a hero of the modern game. That was it going wrong. That was it right there.

Stepping away: The 34-year-old has called time on his England career after 114 caps

Name Gerrard’s greatest performance for Liverpool. It is impossible to stop at one.

The second half of the 2005 Champions League final; the FA Cup final in 2006; that Champions League tie against Olympiacos in 2004; the 3-0 win over Everton in 2012; Napoli in the Europa League in 2010; as a 21-year-old against Manchester United in 2001.

Anfield regulars would not stop there. They could add another 50, maybe 100. Southampton, New Year’s Day, 2001; Marseille in 2008. Games that Liverpool would not have won without Gerrard, the pumping heartbeat.

Now do the same with Gerrard and England. Several of those who have seen each one of his 113 appearances tried it yesterday. There was a consensus on Andorra away in 2007 under Steve McClaren. And not a whole lot else.

He was very good when England beat Germany 5-1 in Munich, but so were a lot of players.

There was a friendly against Hungary immediately after the 2010 World Cup, when he stopped the Fabio Capello backlash reaching its shrill crescendo.

And he was most consistent in the qualifying campaign for the 2010 World Cup, albeit in a starting position on the left, which he hated.

Irregular: There have been fewer great displays for England, with the best arguably against Andorra in 2007

Yet Gerrard’s malaise is England malaise. Just as the national team is less than the sum of its parts, so his century of England appearances do not amount to his best 10, maybe his best five, for Liverpool.

Gerrard, an admirable individual of great honesty and often given to brutal self-analysis, admits as much. On the occasion of his 100th cap, he said he had played six or seven good games for England.

That was harsh. It is generally agreed Gerrard has frequently hit a standard that justifies his inclusion. Only very recently has his place in the team been questioned, and never by Roy Hodgson.

He has asked Gerrard to stay as captain, and he will consider his future in the coming weeks. Yet it is impossible to divorce Gerrard’s legacy as a player from the decade or so of underachievement from what was a highly promising England group.

‘If we can’t make this one a player, we might as well give up,’ Sir Alex Ferguson once said, viewing the young Ryan Giggs.

Looking back on Gerrard’s international career, it would appear the England machine has failed even that simple challenge. It has taken one of the greatest England footballers of this, or any, generation, one of the most talented players in the world, the midfielder Luis Suarez says is the greatest he has played with, and somehow reduced him to mediocrity.

It is as if someone has pulled the plug on The Beatles, chucked a blanket over Gainsborough, brought the curtain down on Larry Olivier. This is one of the finest footballers we will ever see. And we’re harking back to a golden hour against Andorra.

Gerrard looked pained on Sunday. Injured, mentally more than physically. He picked at the back of his leg until he drew blood, and his face was wrinkled so intensely a bicycle could have been parked in one of the furrows on his brow.

He recalled the afternoon after the night before, flicking around on his hotel television, back and forth, checking on Italy’s game with Costa Rica in the hope there might be one last lifeline. It wasn’t to be. Gerrard gave the impression he half expected as much. 

‘There was a small, tiny glimmer, but that made the pain even worse when the game was gone,’ he said. ‘It was a desperate position to be in.

'To me, that’s not good enough, to be relying on others, when you’ve got the talented players we have in this squad.

'The margins are smaller now from where we were two years ago but, sitting here, we’re bitterly disappointed. It’s killing me not to have any positives to speak about.’

Dead rubber: England and Gerrard trained ahead of the Costa Rica match on Tuesday

England are all about accentuating the positives in Brazil, but it seems so empty in the wake of the poorest performance at a World Cup since 1958. The margins are small, was yesterday’s mantra.

Yet in three hours of football, England have not been ahead in a match, once. The group of death myth has also been exploded. No group of death is won by Costa Rica, as seems likely here. Italy were not world-beaters. Uruguay truly are Luis Suarez plus 10 others.

In Belo Horizonte on Tuesday,  England will face a Costa Rica team that would not merit a second glance from many Premier League clubs - even, in Joel Campbell’s case, the one that holds his registration, Arsenal. 

It was hoped this game would be the comfortable victory that confirmed English progress, after tussles with Italy and Uruguay. Instead, it is a desperate attempt at saving face.

England have never lost every match at a World Cup, and a draw would merely confirm Costa Rica’s place as winners of Group D. Either outcome would be a savage denouement for Hodgson.

And a win? It would be scant consolation. This, then, is the proverbial kick into nothing.

‘The last couple of days have been grim,’ Gerrard conceded. ‘It’s a tough moment. In my head, I’ve got a mixture of emotions: frustration, pain.

'The season for Liverpool ended badly for me and the team. I was coming out of that, trying to put it to bed, trying to get some positivity back through the World Cup. This is exactly what I didn’t want to happen. 

‘I have to try to grieve, get away with the family and away from international football, and then make a decision on my future.

'It would be wrong for me to make that decision now. I will consider it long and hard, speak to people who will guide me. I’ve put everyone before myself. I’ve done that all the way through. This time I’ve got to make the decision that is best for me. I’ve told Roy I’ll need three weeks to clear my head.

‘It’s difficult to put into words. When you’re an England player, the captain, a fan and you’ve worked so hard to get into this position, for it to backfire over a few days, it’s a tough place to be. I’m not going to share blame or responsibility. I’ve got to take it on the chin.’ 

When England’s underachievement was put before Hodgson, the England manager had little in the ways of tangible answers.

Endemic: England's problems run far deeper than anyone imagined they did before Brazil 2014

‘Costa Rica were the team who were going to finish bottom of the group,’ he said. ‘Yet they’ll win it and might end up winning all three games. But if you can become a good team, maybe you can survive without necessarily having world-class players. 

‘Look at their team. Their players weren’t regarded as world-class before the tournament, and maybe not after it, but they’ve had success together. Maybe there is something for us to learn from that.’ 

It sounded like clutching at straws, the idea a new England can be formed, minus its marquee names and elite performers. Is this really where we go from here, the acceptance that while we might fail to make an international footballer out of a truly exceptional player in Gerrard, we might succeed with an inferior model? 

There is no logic in that, no reason. If the path from here involves alchemy, the problems are greater than we have imagined. Deep down they all know it, too.
