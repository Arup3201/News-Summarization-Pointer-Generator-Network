QPR have enquired about signing Marseille midfield maestro Mathieu Valbuena and want teenage Uruguay striker Kevin Mendez.

So far Rangers have brought in defensive duo Rio Ferdinand and Steven Caulker, but are in major need of strengthening their attack, with Charlie Austin and Bobby Zamora the only strikers on Rangers books to date.

Rangers have been alerted to the 18-year-old Mendez, who plays for Penarol,  and was also one of the stars at the U17 World Cup last year.

Hoop heaven: Could QPR pull off a major coup by signing Mathieu Valbuena and young forward Kevin Mendez?

Prolific: Rangers are one of a host of clubs interested in signing Watford signing Troy Deeney

West London neighbours Chelsea have also expressed an interest in the youngster.

France international Valbuena, 29, has been made an offer by Dinamo Moscow but is reluctant to move to Russia and is awaiting interest from La Liga. Elsewhere, QPR are also considering a renewed offer for Norwich's Leroy Fer and have tabled a bid for Troy Deeney at Watford, but are way short of the £10million valuation currently.
