A  man, who is serving life  for fatally torturing the 10-month-old son of his de facto partner, received another four-year sentence for bashing the mother before kidnapping the baby boy.

Mervyn Kenneth Douglas Bell was convicted after a judge-alone trial in the Western Australian Supreme Court of sexually assaulting and murdering Charles 'Charlie Boy' Mullaley in March 2013, and was sentenced in December last year to life in prison with a minimum of 27 years behind bars.

On Wednesday, Bell, 27, received a further four years and 10 months in prison after pleading guilty to causing grievous bodily harm to Charlie’s mother Tamica Mullaley.

However, Bell will not serve anymore time, as the term will run in conjunction with the murder sentencing, The West Australian reported.

The night before he took the baby, Bell punched and kicked Ms Mullaley outside a neighbour's house in Broome, Western Australia and left her on the ground in a bloody mess after stripping her naked.

She suffered severe bruising to her face, back and stomach, a laceration to her kidney and a badly bruised spleen.

When paramedics were tending to Ms Mullaley  by police, Bell convinced a neighbour to hand over Charlie to him.

Bell wanted payback for Charlie's mother humiliating him after an argument about alleged infidelities, so he took Charlie and drove almost 1000 kilometres on a very hot day.

After abusing the baby for about 15 hours inflicting broken bones, burns and bruises, Bell took the boy to the Fortescue Roadhouse near Karratha but Charlie died.

In her victim impact statement, Charlie's mother, Tamica Mullaley broke down in tears as she told court of her agony and how she felt powerless when she learnt what had happened to her son.

'I felt sick. How could someone do this to a child?' she said.

'My son would have been petrified.'

Ms Mullaley cried as the statement was read out to the court in December, describing her son as a happy boy who was always smiling. 

'This will forever be a lifetime sentence for me.

'I feel a sense of loss and I just do not know what to do.'

Instead of watching baby Charlie grow, Ms Mullaley said she had to visit his grave on his birthday.

The grieving mother added that she was scared every time she saw someone who looked like Bell.

Charlie's grandfather, Ted, wrote he felt guilty for not babysitting that night, and believed police let them down by responding slowly to his concerns about Charlie's safety.

He said when he learnt Charlie was dead, he felt shocked and numb, adding it still tore his heart apart to think too much about his grandson.

The night before he took baby Charlie from Broome, Bell assaulted the baby's mother so badly that she ended up in hospital and has now received another four-year setence for the brutal bashing

Justice John McKechnie said in sentencing that it was one of the most evil cases he had encountered.

'Once in every 10 years there comes a crime so evil that it shocks the public,' he said.

Although Bell had not intended to kill the baby, his overall intention was to injure him enough to threaten his life, Justice McKechnie said.

'The fact that you did not intend death counts for little,' he said.

Justice McKechnie noted that Bell had a traumatic childhood with a violent stepfather, and had some psychopathic traits, although he was not a psychopath.

He added that Charlie must have been in terrible pain in his final hours.

Justice McKechnie had considered imposing an indefinite jail term on Bell but said that would not be appropriate.

Bell kept his head down during sentencing.

Ms Mullaley was hospitalised after Bell attacked her before he fled Broome, and she still faces charges over an assault on police that night.

She has demanded to know why police did not search for Charlie immediately.

Police are conducting an internal investigation.

Outside court, Ms Mullaley said she was satisfied with the sentence and would continue to try to be strong for the sake of her other children.

Baby Charlie was left with broken bones, bruises and burns to his body

At the time of conviction, Justice McKechnie, who presided over the trial without a jury, combed through forensic evidence including graphic images of the dead baby before handing down the guilty judgement.

Bell had claimed the child's injuries were caused by multiple factors, including when he fell out of a moving car travelling at about 60km/h, when the boy sat on hot rocks by a river, and when he fell into the water.

But Justice McKechnie said Bell's claims the baby had fallen from a car seat were a 'lie' and that rocks had caused his burns was 'unbelievable'.

Bell had showed a 'callous disregard for his health and safety', Justice McKechnie said.

During the trial, the court heard the cause of death could not be ascertained, but the baby had suffered a broken arm and leg, third-degree burns on parts of his body, and severe bruising on his genitals and anus. 

'It is not possible for the deceased to have injured himself,' Justice McKechnie said.

'He was not yet able to walk.'

Justice McKechnie said while Bell had not intended to kill the baby, his overall intention was to threaten the child's life, which meant he was guilty of murder.

The family said the loss of the baby was an 'unbearable grief' they would have to live with

The child's mother and supporters wept and cheered in court when the verdict was handed down.

Bell was remanded in custody for sentencing in December, with Justice McKechnie warning him at the time that he would face a life sentence. 

Outside court, the baby's aunt read a statement on behalf of the family, thanking the detectives in the case but saying the local police should have acted more swiftly when the kidnapping was reported.

'(The baby's) beautiful eyes would have searched for his mother,' the aunt read.

'But he was not to know she was under custody in intensive care in Broome Hospital having just been critically bashed by Mervyn Bell and strangely arrested by Broome Police when they attended the assault.

'His eyes would have searched for his beloved Pop who, as soon as he realised he had been taken by Mervyn Bell, frantically sought help from Broome Police to find him and sadly was turned away.'

The family said the loss of the baby was an 'unbearable grief' they would have to live with.
