A young woman born with no ligaments is suffering a condition so rare doctors have not been able to diagnose it.

Lucy Foran has launched a worldwide search, desperate to find others born with a similar condition.

The 20-year-old has no ligaments, the connective tissues that hold joints together.  

All her joints are either partially or fully dislocated, leaving her unable to run or jump.

Lucy Foran, 20, is a medical mystery. She was born with no ligaments, the connective tissues that hold joints together. This is so rare that doctors are unable to diagnose her

All of Miss Foran's joints are either fully or partially dislocated, leaving her unable to run or jump. She endures gruelling physiotherapy sessions with Melissa Loche (the pair are pictured left and right) to strengthen her muscles

And she also experiences problems with her lungs, feet and eyes, 7 News reported. 

Doctors have been unable to diagnose the condition, so her family, who she lives with in Queensland, Australia, have dubbed it the 'Lucy syndrome'.

Every day she completes a gruelling physiotherapy routine to strengthen her muscles.

Her physiotherapist Melissa Loche said the fact Miss Foran is able to walk with her condition is remarkable, and credits her hard work in her daily sessions.

All her joints are dislocated either fully or partially, she said.

She told 7 News journalists: 'Lucy's tolerance to pain is quite remarkable. She goes above and beyond what many people would be able to do.'

Now Miss Foran has began a global hunt find out if there is anyone else with her condition.

Miss Foran lives with her parents in Queensland, Australia. She is now searching for others like her. 'I would be the happiest girl in the world just to know that someone out there is like me,' she said

Her physiotherappist Melissa Loche says Miss Foran has a higher pain threshold than most people. The fact she is able to walk is down to her own hard work during physio sessions, she said

'I would be the happiest girl in the world just to know that someone out there is like me,' she said.

Her doctors said  it would help them to see how the condition develops, and the journey someone else is on.

Despite her mysterious condition, Miss Foran manages to stay positive, and is grateful for her family's love and support.

She considers herself 'lucky', she said. 

She added: 'I've got a family that loves me regardless of what's going on with my bones.' 

A father desperate to prevent his children suffering has launched gave up his job to find a cure for his children's rare degenerative disease. 

Daniel and Julien Sireau, aged 10 and 12, have black bone disease – also known as Alkaptonuria (AKU) – which will cause them to develop severe early-onset osteoarthritis unless a cure can be found.

The genetic disease causes the bones, cartilage, urine and earwax to turn black. It also results in brittle bones and heart disease.

Desperate to prevent his children suffering, in April this year he launched a clinical trial into a treatment he believes could stop their rare disease progressing.

If the drug trial is successful, the pill could be offered to all patients with the same genetic condition.
