Poundland's profits have soared by a quarter to more than £40million and it plans  to open 60 new outlets as  Middle England battles the cost-of-living squeeze.

The chain has overcome the stigma of being a budget brand to become one of the few success stories on the high street.

At one time, middle-class neighbourhoods campaigned to keep Poundland out, but today it is seen as vital to breathing life into threatened shopping areas.

Success story: Poundland boss Jim McCarthy has seen profits soar by a quarter to more than £40million and plans to open 60 new outlets

More than 4million people shop in Poundland every week, up from 3.5million a year ago.

The company's expansion plans promise to deliver 2,000 jobs this year at a time when other chains are closing stores.

A move to offer household-name brands 
has helped the chain attract the middle-class families who might have 
balked at using a pound shop.

The brands include Cadbury, Nestle, Disney, Weight Watchers, Fairy, Pampers and Organix baby food.

Currently, its shelves are offering a 
raft of £1 camping trip items for the music festival crowd, ranging from
aluminium water bottles to enamel mugs and bowls, cutlery and emergency
rain shelters.

The chain, which has more than 400 
outlets, achieved sales of £780million in the year to April 1, up by 
21.6 per cent on the year before.

Moving up: Offering household name brands has helped the chain attract the middle-class families who might have balked at using a pound shop

Its pre-tax profits of £40.1million 
were up 26.5 per cent. The chain has opened 22 stores this year already,
including four in the Republic of Ireland.

Its 400th outlet opened in Haringey, 
North London, in April, while it will open a 200,000sq ft south-eastern 
distribution centre at Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, next month.

Chief executive Jim McCarthy said: 
'Our fixed price makes it easy for families to budget as they can see 
how much they've spent, before they get to the checkout. Our strong 
sales and volume increases demonstrate that customers recognise the 
exceptional value for money that Poundland offers.'

He added: 'Waste of any kind has become abhorrent.

'In 1990, when Poundland was created, 
there weren't many Aldis and Lidls, TK Maxxes and Poundlands. Now there 
are price comparison sites and people shop with their smartphones.

'There is definitely some structural shift going on in shopping values.

'Poundland is a great business in good
times, and a good business in times of tough economic conditions. We 
have the benefit of those who choose to shop with us, and those who need
to shop with us.'

In its financial statement, the 
company said: 'The UK consumer remains under pressure as a result of the
on-going difficult economic conditions that prevail in the UK and 
Ireland.

'Our products are of increasing importance to challenged customers from all socioeconomic groups.

'Notwithstanding the challenges of the
economy and the competitive environment, Poundland is expected to 
perform robustly in the coming year.'

The first Poundland store opened in 
Burton on Trent, Staffordshire, in 1990, founded by a father-and-son 
team who later sold the business to US-based private equity group Advent
International.

Now the stores offer a range of 3,000 items for £1 each, with around 65 per cent being branded goods.

In the past year, the chain has sold 
more than six million boxes of  Maltesers,  two million umbrellas, more 
than 2.5million CDs and 500,000 garden gnomes.

The store hit the headlines last week 
when unemployed geology student Cait Reilly, 22, said it was 'like 
forced labour' to be forced to give up volunteering in a museum to work 
for free at Poundland – or risk losing her benefits.

She asked the High Court to rule that it was unlawful for her to  be made to work to keep her jobseekers' allowance.

The hearing continues.
