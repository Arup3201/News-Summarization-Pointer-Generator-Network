Toys 'R' Us Australia has been fined more than $10,000 for selling cots that did not meet safety standards.

The infringement was issued by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to the toy retailer.

The Nantucket 4-in-1 household cots were sold across Toys 'R' Us and Babies 'R' Us stores throughout Australia as well as online between February and November 2013.

Testing shown to the consumer watchdog confirmed that the cots did not meet the mandatory safety standard, and that there was a risk of 'injury or death to infants from the cots, including from falls, entrapment or suffocation.'

The retail chain cooperated with the ACCC, establishing a recall soon after being notified of the problem. 

The infringement notice was labelled as a disappointment by the ACCC, who said that Toys "R" Us failed to identify the problem through their compliance system.

'Mandatory safety standards prescribe certain design, performance and labelling requirements to safeguard Australian consumers from the risk of serious injury or death,' ACCC Deputy Chair Delia Rickard said.

'Retailers have an obligation to exercise effective and ongoing due diligence in sourcing and testing products before stocking them for sale to consumers, in particular where a failure to do so puts the safety of infants and children at risk,'

'The ACCC is committed to ensuring that all Australian suppliers, regardless of their size, meet their product safety responsibilities.'

Toys "R" Us has agreed to provide further notices to customers about the recall, and will offer free collection of affected cots and refunds to customers.

The retail chain will also be taking efforts to improve its product safety procedures, introducing a consumer law compliance program as part of the court enforced undertaking.

'It is disappointing that the Toys R Us compliance system failed to identify this problem. Companies must have quality assurance systems that can ensure the integrity of their supply chain and that important product safety standards are complied with,' Ms Rickard said.

'Adopting and maintaining a comprehensive compliance program is a fundamental aspect of any retailer’s ability to comply with safety standards.'

The ACCC has noted that the undertaking will be available on the public register, and the infringement notice is available on the infringement register.
