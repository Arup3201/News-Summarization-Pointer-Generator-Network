Rafael Nadal will make his first appearance at London's Queen's Club in four years this summer as the main part of his Wimbledon preparation.

The world No 3 has opted for the Aegon Championships over the rival event in Halle, Germany, as he seeks to rediscover his best form on grass.

Nadal's best years at SW19, including his two titles in 2008 and 2010, have come when he has done the bulk of his preparation in the capital.

It is also different this summer in that there is a three-week gap between Roland Garros and Wimbledon, therefore allowing him a week's rest after his usual run to the finals weekend in Paris.

Nadal said: 'I always loved playing at The Queen’s Club and I am very happy that I will be back this year.

'It was a great experience for me to lift the trophy in 2008 because it is such an important and traditional tournament. To win Wimbledon a few weeks later was like a dream.

'Coming to the Aegon Championships helps with the adjustment from clay to grass because the grass courts at Queen’s are so good.

'It is also a tournament where the people are very nice - the organisers and of course the spectators who always make me feel very welcome in London.'

Andy Murray will be his main rival for the title. Murray is back in his second home for the Miami Open this week, where Heather Watson and Kyle Edmund will also feature in the main draw.

Third seed Murray has been given a first-round bye and will face Donald Young or Yen-Hsun Lu in the second round, while Watson and Edmund both face qualifiers in their respective openers.
