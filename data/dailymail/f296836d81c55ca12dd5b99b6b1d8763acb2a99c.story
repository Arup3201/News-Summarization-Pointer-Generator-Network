Warrant: Andrew Rutter, who has been sentenced to six and a half years in jail for shaking his baby, is on the run

A father who violently shook his baby because he wouldn’t stop crying went on the run part-way through his trial, which saw him sentenced to six and a half years in prison.

Andrew Rutter, 28, from Walkden, Greater Manchester, disappeared as evidence mounted against him over his cruelty to his son, Jacob.

His trial, at Bolton Crown Court, continued in his absence after he went missing on Tuesday, and, after sentencing him, the judge issued a warrant for his arrest.

While babysitting for the seven-month-old, Rutter sent a series of desperate text messages to the infant’s mother, Samantha Harper, 22, who was at work.

‘He is doing my head in, he won’t stop screaming,’ he wrote. ‘I can’t handle him,’ he said in a second message. And a third read: ‘If you keep being soft with him I’ll never have him again.’

The alarm was raised after Rutter sent a fourth text saying: ‘He can’t open his eyes, he’s gone all floppy.’ This was followed up with the message: ‘He won’t wake up - I’m getting worried now.’

Ms Harper called the out-of-hours doctors service for advice but the baby’s health deteriorated and he was taken to a walk-in centre.

Staff examined him and called an ambulance to take him to hospital where was found to have been shaken so violently he suffered a bleed to his brain.

Scans showed the youngster had suffered a subdural hematoma and he had to spend more than a month in hospital.

Now two years old, Jacob is currently living with his grandparents and, despite his injuries, is not thought to have suffered any long-term problems.

Rutter, who had been on bail, turned up for the start of his trial on January 20.

But he failed to appear on Tuesday after the prosecution finished its case against him - and he has not been seen since.

On Thursday a jury - who heard the incident was a ‘moment of madness’ - convicted Rutter in his absence of causing grievous bodily harm with intent and cruelty to a child by wilful neglect.

Today, Rutter was the subject of a 
police man-hunt after Judge Timothy Clayson issued a warrant for his 
arrest and said he would face six years and six months jail when he is 
captured.

Judge Clayson said: ‘The defendant had become increasingly frustrated with Jacob.

‘Medical
 evidence in the case indicates that Jacob was significantly subjected 
to a violent shaking that resulted in a serious injury to his brain.’

He added: ‘There is a trail of evidence via text messages that demonstrates what happened.

‘The
 defendant didn’t take any steps to summon any medical help. He didn’t 
reveal what he had done to his girlfriend. Samantha did contact the 
walk-in centre but was not in a position to say what had happened.

‘The next day the baby was taken to a medical centre and then the hospital and received treatment some weeks thereafter.

‘There is no up-to-date progress but his grandparents seem to be positive and it’s to be hoped that there are no serious long term problems.’

The incident occurred on May 13 2012 while Rutter, who has 22 previous convictions, but none relating to violence, was alone with Jacob. He became ‘frustrated’ with his son’s crying.

Prosecutor Rob Hall said of the text messages: ‘It indicates that Rutter shook him in a manner that is beyond anything appropriate and then knowing what he had done, failed to do anything to assist the child in getting any sort of care.

‘These are the type of messages you might get from a parent who was losing their self-control and displaying increasing anger.’

Defence counsel Wayne Jackson, said: ‘While I concede there was a shaking injury at some point, I say the evidence does not support any shaking on the day in question.’

Ms Harper was cleared of child neglect at an earlier hearing after the prosecution discontinued proceedings against her.
