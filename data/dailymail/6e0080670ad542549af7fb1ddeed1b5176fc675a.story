A Mexican diplomat and his wife didn’t call 911 before getting a cab to New York City hospital with 5-month old baby son who later died in ‘suspicious’ circumstances, it emerged today.

Eduardo Rocha Bracamontes, 36, and his wife Gina Ximena Ovalle, 26, left their a upmarket building in Midtown, Manhattan, to hail a taxi to a nearby hospital instead of calling emergency services and waiting for an ambulance to arrive.

‘That’s how it works in a third world country,’ Roger Asmar, the attorney retained by the couple, told MailOnline today. ‘The baby would die in your hands if you call 911 and wait for authorities to come'.

‘In an emergency you take your child straight to the hospital.’

Diplomat: Eduardo Rocha Bracamontes works at the Mexican Consulate in Manthattan. He and his wife took a cab to the hospital rather than dialling 911

The parents handed over the couple’s infant son Eduardo Rocha Ovalle to hospital staff at around 9pm on Tuesday. Staff at the hospital contacted police.

The whereabouts of the father and mother is unknown, but Mr Bracamontes hasn’t returned to work as he in a grieving state. 

But they were unable to resuscitate the boy, who had bruises and cuts on his body, and he was pronounced dead shortly afterward. 

The couple had left their fourth floor apartment on E. 32nd Street apartment to bring him to NYU Langone Medical Center - six minutes away in clear traffic - where he was pronounced dead, police said. 

‘They brought him to the hospital and hospital staff called 911,’ a police source confirmed. 

Although a preliminary autopsy proved inconclusive NYPD Police Chief Raymond Kelly said today that the investigation remains ‘open’ pending further testing. 

‘We're waiting for a toxicology report that will take up to two weeks,’ he said. ‘The Mexican ambassador was informed that there were no charges against the individual(s) at this time. 

‘The investigation is still open.’ Despite not calling 911 the couple’s lawyer said his client’s are already in the clear. ‘They did the right thing – they rushed their son to the hospital and I believe it’s clear both my clients have nothing to do with his death.’ 

The lawyer didn’t confirm whether or not the child suffered from epilepsy, as has been reported. 

‘I do know he was suffering from a condition,’ Asmar said. ‘But I’m not clear what the condition is as I’ve never seen the medical documents regarding that.’ 

The couple claim the bruises and cuts across his body were were self-inflicted. 

The New York Daily News reported that the baby boy had a laceration to his scalp and cuts on his right thumb and a toe.

Home: Police have been called to the family's home in this Manhattan building twice for domestic spats

The parents are cooperating with police, their lawyer said. 

‘[Eduardo] has been very cooperative with the investigation by providing any information that’s needed.’ 

A downstairs neighbor, who requested anonymity, was home on that fateful Tuesday night. 

‘I was downstairs that night and I didn’t hear nothing no crying no yelling, nothing. And the walls are so thin here that you hear everything.’ Not long afterward the tenant saw the mother ‘sitting downstairs waiting for cops.’ 

The tenant said the couple moved into the building 10 months ago and recalled the cops paying two visits to the apartment. ‘[Gina] called the cops and was crying saying he shook her.’ 

Cops confirmed that they were called to the home that the couple lived in twice for ‘verbal disputes’ in September and October, however there’s no record of any arrests. 

But the neighbor said as parents they doted on their son. ‘I would see them go out together with the stroller just like a happy family,’ the tenant said. ‘And she would show pictures of the baby saying, “Look at him in this outfit or in that.”’ 

According to Carlos Gerardo, press attaché at the Mexican consulate, Eduardo Rocha Bracamontes ‘is a consular official who has consular immunity.’ 

Gerardo said the diplomat shares the same [diplomatic] immunities as all consular officers. Today, a funeral home claimed the boy’s body, a spokeswoman fro the medical Examiner’s Office confirmed.
