James Peter Sabatino posed as a record company executive had unpaid hotel bills of $250K in MiamiJames Peter Sabatino

A conman who posed as a record company executive in Miami has been arrested for not paying hotel bills of up to $250,000.

Peter Sabatino, 36, was held after police burst into his Miami hotel room where he was having sex with a teenage girl.

One of his unpaid bills at a Hilton Hotel included bottles of champagne that amounted to $100,000.

Sabatino is alleged to have stayed at several Miami Beach hotels with friends after allegedly fooling them into believing he was a record executive entertaining corporate clients.

He is alleged to have persuaded the hotels that the bills for his stay should be sent to his employer.

'He lived like a king,' said Miami Beach police Sgt. Bobby Hernandez.

Police said Sabatino told staff at the Eden Roc hotel, favored by A-list celebrities - that he was working for Warner Bros. pictures and needed three rooms.

His three day stay cost was $7,000 before he allegedly walked out without paying.

Sabatino, who weighs 360lbs at 5 foot 6, next checked into the SLS Hotel on Miami's South Beach.

He said he worked for the record label Roc-A-Fella and that he was there to entertain the rapper J. Cole.

The hotel checked him into two $697-a-night private villas and one $296-a-night room.

Once the bill hit $16,000, he and his friends took off.

Next stop was the South Beach Hilton where he posed as a Sony executive.

During his five week stay he ran up a bill of $150,000 - with $100,000 spent on champagne.

Police said he and his entourage ordered only the finest food and are said to have run room service waiters ragged with their continual orders.

Investigators sent out a bulletin to all hotels in the Greater Miami area as US Marshalls joined local law enforcement in the search for the alleged conman.

A manager at the Hyatt Regency in Coral Gables saw the bulletin and recognized him as a guest who had checked in last Friday, asking for several rooms, including the presidential suite.

The manager called police. When officers arrived at 2 a.m., they found their man in bed, having consensual sex with a 17-year-old girl, police said.

Officers found $50,000 worth of champagne in his Honda Civic car.

Sabatino had two outstanding warrants at the time of his arrest, one from Broward County and the other from a federal probation violation.

Sabatino,whose father once managed a restaurant owned by the sons of infamous New York City mobster Paul Castellano, has a history of white-collar crime that began when he was a teenager, according to court records.

At 18, Sabatino posed as a Blockbuster executive and was able to accumulate 262 tickets to the 1995 Super Bowl in Miami.

He sold them for $170,000 then went on the run, but turned himself in six months later, saying he was tired of hiding out.

When he was 22, Sabatino threatened to 'cut the [bleep]ing heads off' federal prosecutors investigating his uncle and other alleged South Florida organized crime figures.

In a plea deal, federal prosecutors dropped a slew of charges, including ones stemming from Sabatinoâ€™s alleged threats to kill then-President Bill Clinton and his brother, Roger, decapitate a federal judge and two prosecutors, and blow up the federal courthouse in downtown Fort Lauderdale.

Sabatino faces charges of grand theft, organized fraud and unlawful sexual acts with a minor.

He is being held at the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center on $55,000 bond.
