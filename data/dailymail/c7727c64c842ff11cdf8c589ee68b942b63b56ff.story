Pope Francis has said he has accepted that he may be assassinated- but has asked God to make sure it doesn't hurt too much as he is 'a real wimp'.

Francis said that if fanatics want to kill him, it is 'God's will'. 

He said: 'Life is in God's hands. I have said to the Lord, "You take care of me. But if it is your will that I die or something happens to me, I ask you only one favour: that it doesn't hurt. Because I am a real wimp when it comes to physical pain."'

Pope Francis has revealed that he accepts he may be assassinated - but has asked God to make sure it does not hurt too much

The pope made the light-hearted comments in an interview with Buenos Aires favela tabloid La Carcova News in which inhabitants of the shantytown Villa La Carcova collectively came up with the questions.

The parish priest of the extremely poor area is Jose Maria Di Paola, or Father Pepe, described as 'the spiritual son of Francis'.

For months, there have been threats against Pope Francis by the ISIS militants, who call him the 'bearer of false truth.'

In January an assassination plot to kill Francis by detonating a bomb in Manila was reportedly thwarted by the Philippines military, although this was denied by the Vatican.

Former Special Action Force (SAF) commander Getulio Napeñas testified before the Philippine senate that the Philippines National Police had received information that Southeast Asian Jihadist terrorist organization Jemaah Islamiya, planned to set off a bomb near the papal convoy.

Italian prosecutors have also warned that the Mafia have considered a lethal strike on Francis.

Francis also used the unusual interview to address the concerns of the slum dwellers. 

He condemned drug trafficking saying that there are now countries that are 'slaves to drugs', and where the traffickers are 'triumphant because they feel that they have won'.

He also answered the concerns of those that feel that today's children 'often live virtual relationships,' The real 'danger' is that children today have the capacity to gather information, but will be transformed into 'young museums', who do not know what to do with what they know.

He said he would visit Argentina in 2016 'in principle'.
