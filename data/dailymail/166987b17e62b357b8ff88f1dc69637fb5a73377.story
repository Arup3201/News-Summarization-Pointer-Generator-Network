Poppy sellers are to be given ‘minders’ after the collectors were subject to a string of vile attacks last year.

In an unprecedented move, teenage volunteers will be chaperoned as they raise money for the Royal British Legion in Bradford.

Last year there were a spate of assaults on those asking for the donations, which go to help the families of soldiers who have been injured or lost their lives.  

Protection: The Poppy Appeal collectors in Bradford will now be chaperoned after a string of attacks

Three young collectors were attacked in Bradford whilst raising money for the Poppy Appeal  - one of whom was just 13.

This year the youngsters will be accompanied by older members of the Royal British Legion and ex Armed Forces.

The Army is also going into at least one local school to talk to youngsters about the need to honour the fallen and overcome cultural barriers.

Army cadet Bethany Holmes, then 13, was one of those attacked last year.

She was spat at three times while collecting for the first time.

Her mum Christine Holmes, 43, a teaching assistant, said: ‘She gave up her whole day and raised quite a bit of money.

‘She was not in uniform because she had only just become old enough to join the cadets but was with another lad who was in uniform.

‘Three Asian boys who were younger than her - about 11 or 12 - came up while she was stood outside a shopping centre.

‘One of them pinched a poppy from the box, turned his back to her, and spat on it unknown to her.’

Bethany ordered the boys to return the poppy and was appalled when she realised what they had done.

‘Then he tried to spit on another poppy and when she grabbed him he spat in her face,’ added mother-of-two Mrs Holmes.

‘She was very upset by what happened at the time and we got a letter from the Royal British Legion saying how sorry they were - and how horrified.

‘She was out there from 9.30 in the morning until five o’clock and this was her reward.

‘It happened 15 minutes before I came to pick her up.

‘So I think providing chaperones is a good idea - but it is also a sad sign of the times.’ 

The incident was reported to police but Mrs Holmes said none of the yobs was ever traced.

Mrs Holmes works a multi-cultural school - Belle Vue Boys’ School in Bradford - and said the Army was coming in to explain the importance of Remembrance Sunday.

‘They will be giving a talk explaining that everyone was involved in the war and the boys should appreciate that and be respectful,’ she said.

As a result the local branch of the Legion has accepted an offer to provide personal protection to its younger collectors.

Bethany, now 14, has now put the incident behind her and is determined to do her bit for Allerton Army Cadet Force.

‘I just don’t want any fuss,’ she said yesterday.

‘I am independent. It might be a good idea but I do not want this.’ 

In separate incidents last year yobs also hurled abuse at two Asian girl cadets and two other sellers were sworn at in the city centre.

One young poppy seller had her tin grabbed from her shoulder.

Grandmother Barbara Allsopp, Poppy Appeal organiser for the Bradford Royal British Legion branch for 13 years, said it had never happened before.

Fears that young collectors, aged from ten to 17, could be too frightened to take part this year prompted the Royal British Legion’s Riders branch to offer their services as chaperones.

The Riders is a branch of the British Legion and was set up in 2004.

Its members are all ex-forces motorcycle enthusiasts who wanted to support the poppy appeal and include riders of all ages from youth members to veterans in their 80s.

The West Yorkshire branch of the Riders will follow the youngsters around during their collections.

Mrs Allsopp said: ‘It is something we need and it’s ideal because it would keep the cadets safe.’ 

Riders West Yorkshire official Rod Walker said: ‘After what happened last year we thought our job should be to support the branches.

‘You have to remember the cadets who are affected by this are very impressionable and in some cases they will turn out to be our future Armed Forces.

‘We have to educate the public why we are doing these collections.’ 

Lord Mayor of Bradford Dale Smith said it was a ‘sad reflection’ that some youngsters were targeted by mindless thugs last year.

‘There are numerous events on November 11 to commemorate the fallen,’ he said.

‘We are strong supporters of the appeal.

'It deals with the past and present generations of service men and women who are always in our minds.

‘It is very important the younger generation are continually reminded - and it is a sad reflection that this small minority did abuse some of the younger collectors last year.

‘I welcome that the motorcycle section will be keeping a watchful eye - but hope their services will not be needed.’
