Richard Horton, 52, was caught drinking while he worked at Albany pub in  Cardiff, and hanged himself  after failing to find work following the incident

A barman who lost his job after being caught on CCTV drinking a pint behind the bar while working hanged himself after failing to work, an inquest heard.

Richard Horton, who was also known as Tash due to his distinctive handlebar moustache, was recognised on security cameras knocking back a pint while he worked at the Albany pub in Roath, Cardiff.

An inquest into his death at Cardiff Coroners Court today heard how the 52-year-old lost his job at the pub where he had worked for 14 years over the incident.

He couldn't find another job and even shaved off his facial hair because he thought it would make it easier for him to get new work.

However, after three months of being unable to find employment, he hanged himself at the home he shared with his girlfriend in the city in July.

His girlfriend of 11 years, Tiny Dunlop, who moved from the U.S. to Cardiff to be with him, found him unconscious and called an ambulance. However, he could not be saved.

Keith Griffith, his friend and the pub's landlord, said Mr Horton was well-known and popular with regulars at the pub, evening running the pub quiz.

He said: 'Richard had a very distinctive look, he had handlebar moustache, always carried a black umbrella and usually wore an RAF flying jacket.

'Everyone knew Richard from how he looked. But he was caught on camera drinking.

'He took the route of resignation because he thought he would have a better chance of getting another job.

'From the day he lost his job until the day he died he had been applying for work constantly.

'He stopped drinking alcohol - he even shaved off his distinctive moustache while he was looking for a job.' 

Mr Horton worked at the Albany pub (pictured) in Roath, Cardiff, for 14 years before resigning following the incident which was caught on CCTV. He was well-known with regular customers and even held the pub quiz

Coroner Thomas Atherton recorded a verdict that Mr Horton, who was originally from Ripon, Yorkshire, had killed himself.

He said: 'Apart from the fact that he had lost his job there doesn't seem to be anything that would have precipitated a desire to end his own life.

'Taking into account the degree of sophistication in the method of death I’m satisfied that he intended to take his own life.'
