From ballroom to ballet and tap, their years of training should stand them in excellent stead on the Strictly dance floor.

The only trouble is, these are meant to be the professionals, not the amateurs.

Viewers and experts have complained some of this year’s celebrity contestants have an unfair advantage over their rivals after it emerged five have previous experience.

The BBC1 show returned on Sunday with an average audience of 8.4million, easily beating the 7.1million who tuned in to ITV’s X Factor at the same time.

As they were paired up with their professional dance partners, many of the celebrities – such as Judy Murray, 54, and Mark Wright, 27 - expressed nervousness at the months of gruelling competition ahead of them.

But it seems some have more to be worried about than others.

Pop star Pixie Lott, 23, is one of the most experienced, having trained in dance for eight years as a child at the elite Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts in London.

Even before she joined the academy on a scholarship aged 11, she went to nightly dance lessons after school and learned to tap dance.

Two years ago, she told an interviewer: ‘I had a double bedroom, which was decorated like a ballet studio. I loved dancing, so there were mirrors and a ballet bar on one wall. Dad even had a wooden floor laid so I could practise on my own.’

Fellow singer Frankie Bridge, 25, also benefited from rigorous dance training as a young girl. Not only was her mother a ballroom dancing coach, she was given classes at primary school and has spent much of her music career learning the choreographed moves in her pop videos.

Meanwhile, presenter Caroline Flack, 34, and boy band star Simon Webbe, 36, have benefited from training on previous reality shows.

Mr Webbe had a taster of the demands of Strictly training when he competed in the Christmas special in 2011, dancing the cha cha with professional Katya Virshilas.

In 2010, Miss Flack trained with Strictly professional Kristina Rihanoff on another BBC show, called Dancing On Wheels, in which contestants were paired with dancers in wheelchairs.

Finally, Casualty actress Sunetra Sarker, 41, is the daughter of a professional dancer and lists Indian dance as one of her hobbies.

Some of the contestants have dismissed claims they are at unfair advantage, claiming they have not been specifically trained in ballroom dancing. Miss Lott has said her stage school training was ‘completely different’ to what she will be doing in Strictly, while Miss Flack said Dancing on Wheels was ‘more of a documentary style programme’ than a competition.

However, one of the UK’s leading dance coaches told the Daily Mail that any previous experience – particularly as a child – will be a ‘significant advantage’ as the competition progresses.

There is disquiet among Strictly Come Dancing fans after it emerged a third of this year's line-up of 15 contestants (pictured) have had previous dance experience

Former national dance champion Warren Bullock, who runs the Zig Zag Dance Factory said: ‘It doesn’t matter what kind of dance it is, if you’ve got any type of training it will help you do ballroom and Latin dancing.

‘Even if you only did ballet as a child, it will still have taught you how to move your body. These contestants will have a real edge over the others. If she’s been to the Italia Conti, she will have been trained to the highest level. She will be heads and shoulders over the others, especially over some of the older ones.

‘It counts for even more when you’ve been trained from a young age. That kind of dance education never leaves you’.

Some viewers said it was ‘unfair’ that Strictly will pit trained dancers against complete beginners.

Writing on Twitter, Hayley Douglas said: ‘Doesn’t it seem a bit unfair that Pixie Lott is competing on #strictly this year when she has ballroom dance training already.’

Luke Harrison added: ‘I’m calling frankie to win already. Seems a bit unfair to put someone in who’s been performing professionally since she was ten!’

And Tina Campbell said: ‘Has Caroline Flack got an unfair Xtra advantage?’

A BBC spokesman said: ‘Ballroom dancing is a specific discipline and none of our celebrities have had enough in-depth training to give them an advantage.’
