A heroin dealer and a fellow inmate imprisoned for stabbing a taxi driver in the back in an unprovoked attack were let out of jail for three hours to watch Fifty Shades of Grey, it has been reported.

Roseanne McCreadie, 34, who is serving nine years for helping her gangster father smuggle heroin into Scotland, was allowed to go and watch the sexually explicit film along with fellow criminal Kim Gray, 47.

Gray, who is less than a year into a 40-month sentence for her near-fatal assault, and McCreadie were taken to the Vue Cinema in Stirling, Scotland, by former inmate Louise McLachlan.

The pair were joined by Louise McLachlan, another former prisoner who had recently been released, who boasted that she had booked them VIP seats for the film (file image)

The trio met while they were incarcerated at Cornton Vale prison, also in Stirling. 

McLachlan even used Facebook to boast about the trip. According to the Scottish Daily Record, she wrote: 'Right my ladies just booked the tickets for 50shades (sic) on Sunday at 12 at the vue.

'VIP seats of course, use [you] sort it out with CV & i’ll pick use up at 12 it finishes at 2.25 so use will make the 3hours no bother.'

McCreadie replied: 'Brilliant lou look 4ward to that babe.'

The drug runner was only just back from a week of release  when she was given a three-hour extension to go and watch the film, according toThe Sun.

Speaking to the paper, Conservative MSP Margaret Mitchell said: 'These were serious crimes. To get let out to go to the flicks is unacceptable.'

McCreadie was jailed as part of a gang of 13 who were given a total of 152 years in 2012 when police busted a heroin smuggling ring that stretched from Liverpool to Scotland.

It is believed that McCreadie had just returned from a week's leave from Cornton Vale prison, Stirling, but was granted an extra three hours to go and watch the film

She was initially sentenced to nine years for her part in the criminal enterprise, but the judge added another 28 days for contempt of court after she yelled 'ya bunch of c****' at the jury.

She was jailed alongside her father Eddie, then 54, who was given 12 years and eight months.

Meanwhile Gray was given 40 months after stabbing 60-year-old cab driver Joe Cameron, causing him to suffer a near-fatal heart attack.

Mr Cameron was called to a fare in Dunfermline in February last year, and when he walked up to the customer's door to collect them, he was attacked from behind by Gray.

Police later told him she stabbed him with a kitchen knife up to the hilt in a motiveless attack. 

A Scottish Prison Service spokesman told MailOnline today: 'We wouldn't comment on individual prisoners.'
