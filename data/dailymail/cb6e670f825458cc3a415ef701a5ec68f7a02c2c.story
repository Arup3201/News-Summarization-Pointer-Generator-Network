A British expat has given birth to the biggest baby to ever be delivered naturally in Spain.

The girl born yesterday, whose name has not yet been released, weighed in at 13lbs 3ozs (6.02kg) - almost twice the size of the average newborn.

Maxime Marin became the first woman in Spain to give birth naturally to a baby heavier than four kilos.

Remarkably Mrs Marin, 40, did not require an epidural during the delivery, Spanish media reported.

The Marina Salud Hospital at Denia, north of Benidorm, on the Costa Blanca, announced the record-breaking birth today.

The hospital announced that both mother and baby were doing well.

Mrs Marin and her Colombian husband already have three children.

Babies weighing more than four kilos have been born in Spain before but all by Caesarean section.

Although large, Mrs Marin's baby girl is well shy of the all-time record.

Last month, Germany recorded it largest 
ever baby when Jasleen was born in Leipzig weighing 13lb 8oz (6.11kg) 
and measuring 23in (57.5cm) long.

Her mother Maria, 31, also gave birth naturally, without the need for a Caesarean.

She had undiagnosed gestational which can contribute to abnormally sized babies.

The largest baby ever recorded was born in Canada to 
mother Anna Bates in 1879.

The boy weighed 23lb 12oz but he died 11 hours later.

In 2005 a Brazilian woman gave birth to a 17lb baby boy named Admilton does Santos.

He was mother Francisca’s fifth child and it is thought that his size was also caused by gestational diabetes.
