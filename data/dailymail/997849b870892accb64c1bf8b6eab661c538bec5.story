A woman has accused a beauty salon of botching an eyebrow wax, leaving her with two layers of skin torn from her eyelids.

Ashley King, from Glendale, Arizona, paid $10 for the wax, only to emerge from the salon with patches of skin missing from raw eyelids and 'bleeding creases.'

'Never have I felt the fire-burning pain that I felt that day,' Ms King told AZ Family, adding that Annie's Fashion Nails, in Glendale, has since refused to take responsibility, and have instead suggested she merely has 'sensitive skin.'

Ms King said that after the first rip of the wax strip on either eyelid, she went 'numb' but as the waxist began tweezing around the area, she had to ask her to stop because it hurt ‘badly.’ 

As soon as she left the salon, Ms King reports her boyfriend warned her 'not to freak out' but that she had skin 'missing' from her eyelids. She promptly started to freak out.

'The doctor saw me immediately and said, "Yeah, there's skin taken from your eyes, and this was due to a burn”,' said Ms King. 'Looking at it, about two layers of skin was taken from my eyes.'

Waxing lyrical: 'Never have I felt the fire-burning pain that I felt that day,' Ms King said following the procedure

Ms King, who said she 'couldn't stop crying' from pain, demanded a refund from Annie's Fashion Nails but was initially refused one. The owner reportedly told her 'it was not her problem.'

Eventually, Ms King was refunded the $10, but insists the salon still refuses to accept responsibility.

3TV approached the salon with photo evidence of the botched wax job but was turned away. The owner allegedly said that she doesn't believe Ms King's injuries were her employee's fault, but if the employee did do this, then she's 'sorry.'

Heated: The owner told this 3TV journalist (pictured) that she doesn't believe Ms King's injuries were her employee's fault, but if the employee - who has since 'quit' - did do this, then she's 'sorry'

The employee in question has apparently 'quit' since the incident.

Ms King has filed complaints with the Arizona State Board of Cosmetology, who are investigating Annie's Fashion Nails; as well at the Better Business Bureau, which has classified the salon as a D- establishment.

'Our goal is to make each client feel comfortable and special!' the salon's website states. 'We invite you to experience the difference in our services.'

Annie's Fashion Nails has four Yelp reviews; three of which are positive and mention 'great prices' and 'friendly staff.'

The fourth however, is less than glowing.

'My toes look really nice, except for the chunks of skin missing around my nails,' wrote a woman from Phoenix, Arizona in 2010.

'It hurts to walk. Four of my toes have scabs surrounding my nails.'

Ms King claims to have hired a lawyer and is seeking damages for her medical expenses.
