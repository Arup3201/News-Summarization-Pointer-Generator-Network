Robin van Persie has revealed how much he misses close friend Nemanja Vidic - both from a personal and professional point of view.

The Holland striker, speaking while on duty at the World Cup, said he counted Vidic as one of his best friends during the two seasons they spent together at Manchester United where their families were also close with their children attending the same school together.

'We became very close in those last two years and I do count him as one of my very best friends,' said Van Persie.

The Dutch captain also had high praise for the no-nonsense Serbian as a defender of the highest order.

'When I think of him as a footballer, Nemanja puts his head where other players are scared to put their feet,' he said.

'I see him diving sometimes to block a ball and when I'm witnessing that I'm scared for him, scared that something bad happens to him. But, this is Nemanja... unbelievable!'

'The way he defends, the way he lives his life is incredible. I will miss him, Manchester United will miss him but Inter Milan can feel very lucky to have him for the next few years.'

Van Persie has been in in scintillating form at the World Cup under future Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal, scoring in both their opening group games against Spain and Australia to secure their passage into the next round.

Holland face Chile on June 23 in a game that will decide the group winners.
