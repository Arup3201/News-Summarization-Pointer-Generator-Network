A cafe owner has been forced to apologise after putting a sign in its window telling mothers they should breastfeed in the toilets.

Tillings Cafe came under fire after a customer posted a picture of the notice - which informs customers they can use the disabled toilet if they want to breastfeed their babies - on Twitter.

But the family-owned coffee shop in Gomshall, Surrey was forced to remove the sign after the National Childbirth Trust, the UK's largest parenting charity, asked for it to be taken down.

The sign, which was posted in the window of Tillings Cafe in Gomshall in Surrey, which told breastfeeding mothers they would have to use the toilets 

The laminated note, which is headed a 'Polite notice for the comfort of customers', read: 'We have baby changing facilities in our spacious disabled toilet.

'There is also a chair nearby which can be taken inside for mothers who are breastfeeding.

'We reserve the right to ask GROUPS of breastfeeding mothers to use this facility instead of feeding at the table.'

The sign angered local mothers, who called for it to be removed.

Hayley Kenway, who has a seven-month-old, said: 'I have been there before and have never had any problems. But after hearing about this I am disgusted that they have requested babies to be fed in the toilets.

'Asking any of their customers to feed in the toilet is a breach of human rights.'

While mother Sophie Stone added: 'It's laughable that they seem to suggest groups of mothers take it in turn to use the chair in the loo.

'I think the screams of hungry babies would cause more disruption than feeding them ever would.'

The note was posted in the window of the family-owned cafe in Gomshall in Surrey

However, the owners have now taken down the sign and have issued a full apology, claiming the sign was meant to present an option for mothers, rather than an order.

Owner June Radford, who has run the cafe for three years, said: 'Tillings can only apologise for a huge miscommunication.

'We have had many happy breastfeeding mums in our cafe in the three years we have been open and we continue to support breastfeeding.

'We have never and would never ask anyone to stop breasting in the cafe, nor leave the cafe.

The sign, headed 'A polite notice for the comfort of customers', was posted on Twitter by a customer and attracted the attention of the National Childbirth Trust 

'We are a small independent family-owned business and we try to do our best to look after all of our customers.

'Being human we can make mistakes and if we have offended anyone in trying to establish an option for more private feeding facilities we can only apologise and ask for your help in telling us what we might do to support the breastfeeding cause.'

Emma Pickett, chair of the Association of Breastfeeding Mothers and a breastfeeding counsellor, said: 'Most people are now aware of the rules that breastfeeding mothers shouldn't be discriminated against.

'To say breastfeeding women should use a disabled toilet is unacceptable as it is unhygienic and what happens if a disabled person wants to use the toilet?

'Everyday breast feeding mums meet up all over the UK with other mums and babies for at cafes so it is important they are catered for.'

Emma Bond, who posted a picture on Facebook of her breastfeeding her premature daughter for the first time, which was then removed from the site 

The cafe row comes after Facebook were forced to reinstated a picture of a mother breastfeeding her severely premature baby for the first time last month after it was removed from the site because it ‘breached nudity rules’

Emma Bond, 24, posted the picture of herself with Carene, who was born 12 weeks early, but soon found it had been removed after it had been deemed 'offensive'.

Meanwhile in September, breastfeeding mother Olivia Pozniak claimed she was forced to cover up with a dirty dishcloth while joining friends for breakfast at a Wetherspoon pub in Bexleyheath.

And in June, 27-year-old Carrie Davies says she was left feeling 'embarrassed and ashamed' after staff at Global Buffet in Cardiff suggested she move while feeding her four-month-old son.

According to the Equality Act of 2010, it is discriminatory to treat a woman unfavourably because she is breastfeeding.

However, in September a breastfeeding mother claimed today that she was ordered to cover up with a dirty dishcloth while joining friends for a breakfast.

Olivia Pozniak, a single 25-year-old, was feeding her 11-week-old son Louie at the Furze Wren pub owned by J D Wetherspoon in Bexleyheath, Kent, when she was told to cover up.

Meanwhile in August Natasha Barnett, 29, from Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, was told by a lifeguard at Middleton Pool that she could not breastfeed her five-month-old daughter Olive because it was 'classed as eating and drinking'.

In June, a mother was asked to sit in a corner by a waitress while breastfeeding her son - to keep her away from schoolchildren eating in the same restaurant.

Carrie Davies, 27, was left feeling 'embarrassed and ashamed' after staff at Global Buffet in Cardiff suggested she move while feeding her four-month-old son Trystan.

Ms Davies, who was lunching with a friend, was offered a spot by the restaurant's toilets, which bosses at the restaurant say was more 'convenient' for her in light of a large school party who had started eating there.

It comes after around 70 women descended on Sports Direct in Nottingham city centre in April to show support for 25-year-old Wioletta Komar, who claimed she was kicked out of the premises earlier this year for breastfeeding her three-month-old son.

She claims a member of staff suddenly marched over and told her that breastfeeding mothers were not welcome because of 'company policy'.

The sales assistant then told her that the store had no facilities for her and suggested she should go to McDonald's which had a baby and mother room.
