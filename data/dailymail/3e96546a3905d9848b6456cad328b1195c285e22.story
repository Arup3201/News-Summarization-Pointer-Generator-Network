Gangland killing: Amateur footballer Kevin Nunes was gunned down in a country lane in 2002

Four police chiefs are at the centre of a corruption inquiry over claims that five gangland killers are the victims of a miscarriage of justice.

The actions of the officers, who occupy senior positions at three forces, are being examined by an independent watchdog.

They include Northamptonshire Chief Constable Adrian Lee, the Association of Chief Police Officers’ spokesman on policing ethics, and his deputy Suzette Davenport.

The probe was sparked by lawyers representing some of the five men jailed for life in 2008 for the murder of drug dealer and amateur footballer Kevin Nunes.

He was gunned down by a ‘firing squad’ after being driven to a   country lane in Staffordshire in 2002.

Questions have been raised over the complex six-year inquiry which a senior judge praised as ‘extremely skilful’.

The convicted killers’ legal teams brought the case to the Court of Appeal over fears that key information was not disclosed ahead of the trial.

Judges alerted the Criminal Cases Review Commission which is responsible for investigating potential miscarriages of justice.

Officials uncovered fresh material about the conduct of officers and 
notified the Independent Police Complaints Commission.

Derbyshire Chief 
Constable Mick Creedon was brought in to oversee the secret and 
sensitive inquiry.

Among the allegations being investigated by his team 
are claims of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and misconduct
in a public office.

Nine serving or former Staffordshire officers have been handed official 
notices warning them that they are under investigation.

They include the
two Northamptonshire chief officers, Staffordshire Assistant Chief 
Constable Jane Sawyers and West Midlands Assistant Chief Constable 
Marcus Beale.

None of the senior officers, who were told they were under investigation
this month, has been suspended. But it is extremely rare, and possibly 
unprecedented, for four officers of such senior rank to be under 
investigation in such circumstances over the same inquiry.

All of them have held senior posts at Staffordshire Police in the period
since 2002. Mr Lee rose through the senior ranks to become acting chief
constable.

Nunes, 20, a talented footballer who was once on the books at Tottenham 
Hotspur, was shot five times on September 19, 2002. The drug dealer had 
been released from custody in Aberdeen 24 hours earlier.

Police suspected the shooting was the result of a turf war between 
criminals in the West Midlands battling to control the Scottish drugs 
market. Levi Walker, Adam Joof, Antonio Christie, Michael Osbourne, 28, 
and Owen Crooks were jailed for up to 28 years each at Leicester Crown 
Court in 2008.

Detectives were initially met by a wall of silence but eventually persuaded a witness to give evidence against the gunmen.

Mr Lee became the head of Northamptonshire Police in 2009.

Northamptonshire Police Authority said it was ‘completely confident’ in 
Mr Lee and Miss Davenport and did not want the inquiry to detract from 
their daily work.

Staffordshire Police Authority said the official notices were ‘not 
judgmental in any way’ and the investigation must be allowed to run  its
course.
