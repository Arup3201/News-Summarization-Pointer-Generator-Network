What better way in the modern day for two football legends to reminisce over their great careers than an open conversation on Twitter?

Ryan Giggs and Javier Zanetti - who both retired this year - took over the Manchester United and Inter Milan Twitter accounts on Friday to discuss some of their finest moments.

Here's how the conversation between the two 40-year-olds went...

Twitter takeover: Ryan Giggs took over the Manchester United account for a chat with Javier Zanetti

Giggs: Hi Javier. Enjoyed the World Cup? As Argentina's most-capped player, you must be proud to see your team in the final.

Zanetti: Amazing, especially for #ARG.Best of luck to our players Rodrigo, @ricky11alvarez & Hugo on Sunday!

And how are you, Ryan? Which teams and players have impressed you most?

Giggs: I'm good thanks! You have to respect the likes of #CRC and #COL – they’ve held their own on the biggest stage in football.

So Javier, is part of you happy not to be doing pre-season training or are you missing it?

Zanetti: I have more time with my family now and this is good, but as soon as I have the chance I'm on the pitch playing football

Giggs: Not sure I'll miss the training! Although, I admit I always loved the buzz around getting back into the swing of things.

Not playing will be strange but I’m excited for my new role. You’re vice-president at @Inter now. That’s a big challenge…

Zanetti: It's very strange, but what awaits is a great challenge.The most important thing was remaining in this great Inter family

You have a new challenge too, as assistant coach to Louis van Gaal. He's had a great World Cup…

Giggs: I can't wait to get started. I'm still in the early stages of my coaching so to work with Louis is a great opportunity.

As you know, we both retired this summer. How difficult was your decision? I thought long and hard about it…

Legends: Zanetti (right) makes a challenge on Giggs during the Champions League quarter-final in 1999

Zanetti: I knew it would happen sooner or later. I was lucky to play until I was 40, so I have no regrets

I was wondering... if you hadn't been a footballer, what would you have done in all these years?

Giggs: I get asked this question a lot. Definitely something sporty! Possibly golf.

The reaction I’ve had from fans since I retired has been incredible. You must have had the same at Inter…

Zanetti: The Inter fans showed me love throughout my career. I can't thank them enough for the support

Do any fan moments stand out for you?

Giggs: Well... there have been so many at Old Trafford. When we were going for the Treble in '99, we went 1-0 down against Spurs... but our fans were just amazing. You could feel the push from the crowd and we went on to win 2-1. I'll never forget it.

Zanetti: People always ask me for my best moment but it’s so hard to pick one. Have you got a favourite?

Giggs: So many! But it has to be lifting the Champions League trophy in Barcelona, back in 1999. You?

Zanetti: It's hard for me to choose but, like you, it was when we won the Champions League in Madrid

Giggs: If there’s one game you could relive what would it be?

Zanetti: The cup final vs Lazio in Paris in 1998, just to be able to feel all those emotions one more time

If I ask you the same, I bet you'll say that final against Bayern Munich in 1999...

Giggs: Definitely… although I only want to relive the last five minutes!

Winning that Treble in 1999 was just incredible. How did you feel winning it with Inter in 2010?

Zanetti: It was an unforgettable year for Inter fans. We won the Treble but we added two more trophies to make it a total of five

So, Ryan... You played with so many players down the years. Which ones did you get on best with?

Giggs: You'll get me in trouble here, Javier! I'd have to say Nicky Butt, Gary & Phil Neville, Paul Scholes and David Beckham.

Going back to 1999, we played against you guys in the quarter-finals. They were tough games, remember?

Zanetti: Of course! I remember our own personal duel. You are one of the toughest opponents I have ever played against

I'm looking forward to seeing you again this summer, in the USA. It's a pity we won't be playing against each other!

Giggs: I know! But I think I would have to wear a face guard... I still remember your elbow! Haha, see you soon.

Zanetti: Haha! Sorry about that.I'm looking forward to it as well.See this commemorative shirt? It's for you 

Gift: Zanetti will present this commemorative Inter shirt to Giggs in America later this month

Giggs: Wow! Thanks so much. I have a shirt for you as well. I'll give it to you in America. See you in Washington DC!
