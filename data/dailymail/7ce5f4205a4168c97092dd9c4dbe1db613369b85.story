Comedy actor Kris Marshall has been banned from driving for six months after he admitted dodging a breath test.

Police found the 38-year-old asleep in his Jaguar in a Tesco car park near his home following a night out drinking.

He was arrested on suspicion of being drunk in charge of a vehicle after police spotted a key in the car's ignition.

But Marshall – known for his roles in 
sitcom My Family and the BT adverts – thought he was being responsible 
by sleeping in the car rather than driving home and was annoyed at being
 arrested, magistrates heard.

He decided to 'avoid giving a 
specimen' and failed to seal his lips properly around a breathalyser 
during an 'official' test at a police station.

Five breath test readings taken 
beforehand ranged from 56 micrograms of alcohol per 100 millilitres of 
breath to 67 micrograms – nearly twice the limit.

Yesterday at South Somerset 
Magistrates Court, Marshall pleaded guilty to failing to supply a 
specimen of breath on September 30.

Chairman of the bench, Geoff West, 
said: 'We can understand how it must have annoyed you that evening. Like
 your lawyer said, it was your only mistake (to not give a sample).

'Nevertheless you have learned a valuable lesson.

'You have got more than 12 points 
which means an automatic six month disqualification. This means you 
cannot drive a motor vehicle in any road or public place at all until 
the period ends.

'If you do drive then you have committed a serious offence and could be sent to prison or disqualified again.'

Marshall was banned for six months 
after the court heard he had also been caught on a mobile at the wheel 
and already had three points on his licence for speeding.

The court heard that Marshall, who 
lives in Long Barton near Wells, Somerset, with his self-employed 
plumber girlfriend, had been in London doing voiceover work on September
 30 this year.

He had returned on the train to 
Castle Cary station - after consuming a gin and tonic on the journey 
back - before picking up his green Jaguar and driving to Wells.

The actor then left his car in the car park and went to a bar for more drinks. He returned before midnight but decided not to drive the short distance back to his village.

Tim Rutherford, prosecuting, said: 'Police were called to Tesco in Wells following reports of a possible drunk driver.

'At 12.04am PC Reynolds attended the 
scene and saw a green Jaguar. He approached the vehicle and saw a male 
by the name of Kris Marshall sat in the drivers seat.

'The seat was reclined he and appeared to be asleep at that point.

'The officer noticed the keys still 
in the ignition, noticed a smell of alcohol. He woke him and said have 
you been drinking - he said "Yes I have".

'His eyes were glazed.'

Police carried out a positive breath 
test on a co-operative Marshall before arresting him and taking him to 
Yeovil Police Station an hour's drive away.

The court heard that when he arrived at the station he decided to 'effectively avoid giving a specimen'.

Mr Rutherford said: 'It appears Mr Marshall failed to seal his lips around the tube.'

Marshall told officers he did not have any medical reason not to take the test - apart from mild asthma.

Richard Hallam, defending Marshall, 
stressed that his client had made the sensible decision not to drive 
back home as he was over the limit.

He told the court that Marshall did 
not want to leave his car to get a taxi or walk home - because it would 
mean going through a large unlit wood.

Mr Hallam said his client had been co-operating with the police right up until they arrested him.

He said: 'The truth of the matter is that he felt a little aggrieved at being arrested.

'He felt he had made a responsible decision in not driving while over the limit. He made a decision to sleep in the vehicle.

'Many members of the public do not understand the charge of being drunk in charge of a vehicle.

'He was a little fed up. He accepts that it was in his mind to affectively avoid giving a specimen.

'I have told him that was a mistake.'

The court heard that Marshall, who 
already had three points on his license for a speeding offence, had 
recently been spotted on the phone while at the wheel.

His lawyer told the court that he had surrendered his license to the police and was awaiting another three points.

Marshall was given another ten points
 by magistrates for failing to provide a sample - resulting in more than
 12 points on his license and an automatic ban.

They also fined him £700 and £100 costs.

The actor, who found fame as Nick 
Harper in the hit BBC series My Family and hit the big screen in the 
2003 Richard Curtis hit Love Actually, made no comment when leaving 
court after his conviction. Originally from Malmesbury, Wiltshire, he studied at Wells Cathedral School and, after failing his A-levels, attended drama school.
