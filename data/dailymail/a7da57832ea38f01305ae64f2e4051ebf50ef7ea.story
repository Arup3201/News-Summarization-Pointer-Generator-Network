Public executions, amputations, lashings and mock crucifixion have become a regular Friday fixture in jihadist-controlled areas of Syria, according to a UN human rights investigation.

A report by the UN Office for the High Commissioner for Human Rights also accused the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad of repeatedly using chemical weapons against civilians.

The report by the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic paints a bleak picture of life for people in Syria, whichever side of the civil war's frontline they are on.

'In areas of Syria under Isis control, particularly in the north and northeast of the country, Fridays are regularly marked by executions, amputations and lashings in public squares,' the report said.

Jihadists from the group now calling itself the Islamic State are also pushing residents, including children, to attend public executions by beheading or a shot to the head, it said.

'Executions in public spaces have become a common spectacle on Fridays in Raqqa and in (Islamic State)-controlled areas of Aleppo governorate,' said the commission.

'Bodies of those killed are placed on display for several days, terrorising the local population.'

The report says the Islamic State, which declared a 'caliphate' across northern Iraq and eastern Syria, is also recruiting and training children as young as 10, with teens being used in active combat and suicide missions,

In the 45-page report on the situation in the war-ravaged country, the panel described beheadings of boys as young as 15, men flogged for things like smoking or accompanying an 'improperly dressed' female relative.

Women have been publicly lashed for not following the group's strict dress code and stoned to death after allegations of infidelity.

Islamic State, which declared a 'caliphate' across northern Iraq and eastern Syria, is also recruiting and training children as young as 10, with teens being used in active combat and suicide missions, the report said.

The jihadists, who sparked outrage last week when they released a video showing the beheading of US journalist James Foley, are guilty of widespread war crimes and crimes against humanity in Syria, the commission said.

The groups was also contributing 'to a spillover of violence affecting international peace and stability,' it warned, stressing that 'risks of the conflict spreading further are palpable.'

The commission was created three years ago by the UN Human Rights Council to investigate abuses committed in the war, which is estimated to have killed nearly 200,000 people.

It will present to the council next month its latest report covering a litany of war crimes and crimes against humanity it says were carried out by the Syrian government, Islamic State and other opposition groups.

Many fighters from Syria's weakened rebel battalions are defecting to Islamic State 'owing to the latter’s superior financial and operational capabilities,' it warns.

Meanwhile, even 'moderate' armed groups are 'closely coordinating with extremist groups, including the Al-Qaida-affiliated Jabhat al-Nusra.'

And it is alleged that rebel groups of all stripes are guilty of targeting regime-controlled civilian areas, including some schools in Damascus. 

The Syrian government, which during the first years of the conflict was blamed for the lion share of abuses and deaths, had since January continued to kill hundreds of men, women and children every week due to the 'indiscriminate firing of missiles and barrel bombs into civilian areas', the report found.

Government forces have also continued to impose their own reign of terror in areas they control, with accounts of torture, rape and deaths in custody 'indicating the existence of a State policy'.

It also said forces loyal to Damascus appeared to have dropped barrel bombs containing the chemical agent chlorine on civilian areas in the north on eight different occasions last April.

'Reasonable grounds exist to believe that chemical agents, likely chlorine, were used on (northern Syrian villages) Kafr Zeita, al-Tamana and Tal Minnis in eight incidents within a 10-day period in April,' the report said.

'Witnesses saw helicopters drop barrel bombs and smelled a scent akin to domestic chlorine immediately following impact,' it pointed out.

Victims, it said, had suffered 'symptoms compatible with exposure to chemical agents, namely vomiting, eye and skin irritation, choking and other respiratory problems.'

The report also warned that some states continue to deliver 'arms, artillery and aircraft' to Damascus, while other states, organisations and individuals are supporting rebel groups.

'The weapons they transfer to the warring parties in Syria are used in the perpetration of war crimes and violations of human rights,' the report says, adding that the commission recommends an arms embargo.

President Bashar al-Assad's regime and rebels have both accused the other of using chemical agents, including chlorine, in the bloody uprising that began in March 2011 and in spite of Damascus promising to hand over all its chemical arms.

The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) mission also said in June that Damascus appeared to be using chlorine 'in a systematic manner'.
