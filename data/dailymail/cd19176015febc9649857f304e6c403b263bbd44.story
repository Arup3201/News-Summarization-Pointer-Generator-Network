George Galloway’s former secretary has been arrested - along with her anti-terrorism officer husband - on suspicion of data protection offences.

Aisha Ali-Khan and her husband, Detective Inspector Afiz Khan, were both arrested on Wednesday on suspicions relating to the mis-use of police databases.

It follows Galloway's allegations in October of 'dirty tricks' by the pair - although the arrests are not believed to be connected to his specific complaints.

Mr Galloway suspended mother-of-one 
Miss Khan, 32, from her role in October - claiming the couple ran a 
smear campaign against the Respect MP for Bradford West, including 
encouraging the Guardian newspaper to run a piece against the party.

He also claimed that the couple slept together at the MP’s house in Streatham, south London, while he was away in Indonesia.

Afiz Khan, a member of the Met’s elite SO15 anti-terror squad, is suspected of misusing police 
databases and abusing his position as a police officer. He has been on 
restricted duties since October.

A Met spokesman said: A detective inspector from specialist operations was arrested this morning at his home address in Watford.

'He has been arrested on suspicion of misconduct in a public office and data protection offences.'

George Galloway, pictured with wife Putri Gayatri Pertiwi, claimed the Met officer had sex with his aide in his house while he was abroad

The spokesman added: 'A
 woman has been arrested [not a Met police service employee] in 
connection with the DPS [Directorate of Professional Standards] 
investigation at her home address in Bradford.

'She has been arrested on suspicion of data protection offences.

'The
 arrests come as a result of an investigation by the DPS into a 
complaint from a member of the public with regard to the actions of an 
officer based within specialist operations.'

In October, Galloway alleged Ali-Khan was a Met police 'agent' who was running a 
'dirty tricks' campaign to discredit the Respect party.

He
 showed emails between the husband and wife which he claimed supported 
his claims - and the Guardian said police are 'trying to 'ascertain' how
 the MP managed to get the private Hotmail emials.

Ali-Khan told the newspaper the emails merely showed a husband 'counselling 
his wife in how to deal with bullying and misogyny in Respect's Bradford
 office.

The pair have been bailed to return pending 
further inquiries in early March 2013.
