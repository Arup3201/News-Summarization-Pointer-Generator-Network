New course: Survival expert Bear Grylls' is launching the initiative in Wales

Learning how to use a knife for survival and tackling extreme river crossings are two of the skills children and parents can learn on a new Bear Grylls course.

The Bear Grylls Survival Academy is launching its 24-hour family trip near Neath, South Wales, on which kids as young as 10 can take part if they are accompanied by an adult.

The overnight break, which costs £429 for two or £858 for a family of four, is designed to inspired fathers and sons, and mothers and daughters to learn the TV star’s extreme techniques.

Techniques
 taught will include learning how to build and light a fire, how to 
navigate at night, and best ways to use a knife for survival.

They will also include foraging for 
grubs and rodents, building a shelter, extreme weather survival and 
river crossings. 

The
 Academy has been designed for parents and 10-17-year-old children by 
Bear Grylls - but it won't be taught by the former SAS reservist, but by
 a team of highly trained experts.

The course will run in Pontneddefechan, close to Pen y Fan - the highest mountain in South Wales. 

This
 area of woodland, fast rivers, gorges and rock faces make it the ideal 
spot, according to the academy, as the terrain is tough with water 
obstacles and high, difficult ground being a key part of the challenge.

Survival skills: The course includes guidance on how to cross a river in extreme weather

Family outing: The course is open to children as young as 10

Bear
 Grylls, who spent three years as a soldier in the British Special 
Forces, said: ‘As a father of three young boys I love sharing my 
survival techniques and going on family adventures together. 

‘It
 is not only exciting and fun but teaches them useful life and outdoor 
skills and what it really means to be able to look after yourself when 
the chips are down. 

‘So
 it is with great pride that we can now launch our 24-Hour Family Course
 in South Wales as a great opportunity for parents to share these 
experiences with their children together.’

Overnight trip: The 24-hour course includes spending a night outdoors under shelter

Survival skills: The group of 12 will learn various techniques while on the 24-hour course

The course is limited to 12 places and the price includes all meals, an overnight stay under shelter and kit.

On completion, participants will receive a Bear Grylls Survival Academy badge and certificate.

Paul Gardiner, MD of Worldwide Experience which delivers the courses with the Bear Grylls Academy, said: ‘Nature, conservation and education are really important to us and we are so excited about this opportunity to work with Bear and his team to inspire people to reconnect with the natural world.

‘The course will give people a really raw but fulfilling experience hopefully leaving people feeling challenged but with big smiles on their faces!

‘The new 24-Hour Family Course is a great addition to existing Five-Day Course based in Scotland which is designed for 18 year olds and up.’
