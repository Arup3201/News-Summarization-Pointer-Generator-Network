There were both positives and negatives to be taken from England's defeat to Italy in their World Cup opener.

The boldness shown by Young Lions Raheem Sterling, Daniel Sturridge and Danny Welbeck in attack chimed with the adventurous approach demanded by the nation.

But weaknesses were exposed at the back when Italy scored their two goals, suggesting Roy Hodgson must find greater balance in the team, while Wayne Rooney's performance came in for criticism.

Ahead of Thursday's match with Uruguay, our reporters have selected the team and the tactics they would choose for this must-win match. See if you agree and join in the debate in the comments box below.

VIDEO Team Profile: England  

First picks: The England team that played against Italy in Manaus on Saturday night

JEFF POWELL

Hart; Johnson, Jones, Cahill, Baines; Gerrard; Sterling, Lampard, Barkley; Sturridge, Rooney

The team needs balance to offer better protection to the back four. Gerrard can help with that if he stays anchored, while Lampard’s  engine and experience can help the youngsters control midfield better than against Italy. Plus we have Rooney back in the position he should play, which would support Sturridge.

LEE CLAYTON

Hart; Johnson, Jagielka, Cahill, Baines; Gerrard, Henderson, Barkley; Sterling, Sturridge, RooneyRooney at centre forward. He’s scored 39 international goals. He’s up against Diego Lugano, who is 33 and has just been given the boot by West Brom. Play him with his back to goal and then build pace all around him, with Sturridge and Sterling running off him right and left. Barkley would come in to help create more chances and to win free kicks around the box. And I’m backing Leighton Baines to score from one. He was exposed in the first game, but he’s an outstanding left back. 

Mixed bag: Wayne Rooney helped set up England's goal, scored by Daniel Sturridge, but otherwise endured a frustrating evening out on the left wing against Italy

Purposeful: Ross Barkley looked lively after coming off the bench against Italy and is in contention to start against Uruguay

MATT LAWTON

Hart; Johnson, Cahill, Jagielka, Baines; Gerrard, Henderson; Sterling, Rooney, Welbeck; Sturridge.

I'd go with the team that is being talked about, with Rooney through the middle and Welbeck and Sterling wide. I'm nervous about the back four but I don't see much of an alternative.   

ROB DRAPER

Hart; Johnson, Cahill, Jagielka, Baines; Henderson, Gerrard; Sterling, Rooney, Welbeck; Sturridge

Rooney central because the threat from Uruguay's midfield is nothing like that from Italy's. However, Rooney, Sterling and Welbeck to rotate positions. Oxlade-Chamberlain, if fit, should be an early change and then Ross Barkley.

Decision time: Roy Hodgson must decide whether to stick with the England side that lost 2-1 to Italy on Saturday night or tweak the team and tactics for the Uruguay clash

Good showing: Danny Welbeck looked lively on the right-hand side but could potentially lose his place if Hodgson switches around the midfield

Comeback: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's return from injury gives England another attacking option 

PETE JENSON

Hart; Johnson, Jagielka, Cahill, Baines; Gerrard, Henderson; Welbeck, Sterling, Rooney; Sturridge

The centre of Uruguay’s defence struggles with direct running so keep Sterling through the middle with Welbeck right running at Caceres. Rooney starts on the left but you make good use of the bench. Uruguay tired badly against Costa Rica so you want Barclay and the Ox getting a good half-hour.

MATT BARLOW

Hart; Johnson, Jagielka, Cahill, Baines; Gerrard, Henderson; Welbeck, Sterling, Rooney; Sturridge

Don't see a reason to change the personnel. That's about as good as we are. We could tighten it defensively but that would be at a cost and it would be a shame to step back from the attacking edge everyone enjoyed against Italy. I hope the team is unchanged but with more flexibility and rotation within the three behind Sturridge. And more forward movement from Henderson.

Back of the net: Daniel Sturridge turns in Wayne Rooney's cross from the left to bring England back to level terms against Italy

LAURA WILLIAMSON

Hart, Johnson, Cahill, Jagielka, Baines; Gerrard, Henderson; Sterling, Rooney, Welbeck; Sturridge

Play Rooney through the middle or not at all, and give Baines more protection by using the hard-working Welbeck in front of him on the left. I'm not sure England need two holding midfielders, so I would encourage Henderson to sit slightly further forward than Gerrard, too.

RIATH AL-SAMARRAI

Hart; Johnson, Cahill, Jagielka, Baines; Gerrard, Henderson; Sterling, Rooney, Lallana; Sturridge

Initially advocated dropping Rooney, but can't help feeling this week's debate will bring the best from him, so long as he plays centrally. Sterling has the versatility to move and Lallana proved himself on the left with Southampton.

Flying: Adam Lallana is also in contention for a starting berth after coming off the bench in Manaus

CHRIS WHEELER

Hart; Johnson, Cahill, Jagielka, Baines; Gerrard, Henderson; Sterling, Barkley, Welbeck; Sturridge

The Rooney debate is getting boring now, so let’s give him a rest and play Ross Barkley behind Daniel Sturridge. Danny Welbeck is more used to that left-sided role than his Manchester United teammate, and Rooney can be used as an impact sub after an hour if things aren’t going well.

Biggest question is where to deploy Wayne Rooney in Thursday night's game with Uruguay

@highlight

Manchester United striker played wide left in Saturday's defeat to Italy

@highlight

He could be pushed up front with Daniel Sturridge or just behind

@highlight

Raheem Sterling and Danny Welbeck likely to keep their places, but Ross Barkely could come in

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain fit again and Adam Lallana has chance
