Guilty: Karl Addo, 30, admitted manslaughter after stabbing his flatmate before decapitating him with a meat cleaver

A paranoid schizophrenic laughed as he brutally knifed his flatmate to death before decapitating him with a meat cleaver.

Karl Addo, 30, launched the 'prolonged and horrific' attack on Spanish student Sergio Marquez at their Bournemouth flat on the 23-year-old's birthday.

Addo repeatedly stabbed his victim during the 20-minute attack, knifing Mr Marquez in the chest before striking him numerous times with a meat cleaver.

A court today heard Addo struck Mr Marquez with such force that the handle of the cleaver snapped.

A neighbour heard Mr Marquez beg Addo to stop the attack by repeatedly yelling ‘please, Karl’ and then the sound of laughter.

Mr Marquez’s headless and mutilated body was discovered a short time later when three of his friends turned up at the flat for the celebrations.

The trio - two girls and a man - fled the gruesome scene screaming for help after Addo fled the property covered in blood.

Bournemouth Crown Court heard that Addo, who pleaded guilty to manslaughter after denying a charge of murder, had a history of mental illness and was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2005 when he was living in Atlanta, US.

He came to UK in 2008 to study aerospace engineering at university in London but endured delusions of being attacked by a gang and injected with drugs.

In October 2011 - nine months before he killed Mr Marquez - a Mental Health tribunal ruled Addo should be sectioned under the Mental Health Act.

But Addo absconded the hearing and disappeared. In February last year he was thrown out of Heathrow Airport for sleeping rough and moved to Bournemouth a month later.

He moved in to the flat but was due to be evicted on the day of the killing after his flatmates complained to their landlord about Addo’s behaviour.

Prosecutor Nigel Pascoe QC, told the court: 'There was tension in the flat. The flatmates let it be known Mr Addo was difficult to live with.

'He was untidy and he ate food that was not his. They complained to the landlord that led to him serving notice.

'On the morning July 17, 2012 Sergio stayed at home while the other two flatmates left the house.

'In the afternoon the landlord spoke to Mr Addo to make sure he was going to leave that day as agreed.'

At about 3.30pm a neighbour said they heard an arguement coming from the property.

Mr Pascoe said: 'He heard the words "please, Karl, please, Karl."

'He heard noise at it sounded like a tormented voice. It lasted for 15 or 20 minutes. He heard a voice laughing and after that all was silent. It was the defendant laughing.

'He did hear at least part of the prolonged and violent attack on Mr Marquez.'

A short time later three friends of Mr Marquez arrived at the flat but failed to get an answer at first.

Devastated: paying tribute to her son, Mr Marquez's mother Maria Marquez Torres said: 'He was handsome, happy, kind, healthy, responsible, fun, and polite. He is a person that is impossible to replace'

Mr Pascoe said: 'They looked through the letterbox and could see the defendant running between the bedroom and bathroom.

'Finally the defendant opened the door. He ran past them and then it was plain to them that he was covered in blood.

'They went inside the flat and looked in the bedrooms. There was a large cleaver in the sink with a broken handle.

'They went into another bedroom and the victim was lying on the bed. He was headless and his stomach had been mutilated.

'The two girls run screaming onto the road and three builders entered the flat and saw the body and called the police.'

Addo was arrested minutes later fleeing down a nearby road with two knives in his pocket.

After being taken into questioning he was detained under the Mental Health Act and held in Broadmoor.

Addo pleaded guilty to a charge of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility today.

The case was adjourned and Addo, of no fixed address, will be sentenced at Bournemouth Crown Court on Wednesday.

Addo pleaded not guilty to a charge of murder. The lesser charge of manslaughter was accepted by the Crown Prosecution Service.

In paying tribute to Sergio, his mother Maria Marquez Torres said: 'Sergio had everything. He was handsome, happy, kind, healthy, responsible, fun, and polite. He is a person that is impossible to replace.

'He had such a beautiful life. He wanted to be a father and have three children, and the thought of this filled him with excitement.'
