Ally McCoist has refused to become embroiled in a war of words with Donald Findlay over the Cowdenbeath chief’s claim that Rangers are a ‘new entity’.

In a Sportsmail interview on Saturday, Findlay controversially insisted he no longer recognises Rangers as the same club he once served as vice-chairman.

Addressing a bitterly divisive newco/oldco debate before hosting Rangers at Central Park in a rearranged Championship clash on Tuesday evening, Findlay said: ‘To me, this is a new Rangers which has to establish its own history and tradition. But it’s not the Rangers I know. To me, genuinely, it is a new entity.’

Then and now: Donald Findlay (left) as Rangers vice-chairman but he now claim the club is unrecognisable 

Supported by Lord Nimmo Smith’s independent investigation into non-disclosed payments to players, Rangers dispute that view and maintain former chief executive Charles Green paid £5.5million for both the assets and the history of the Ibrox oldco post-liquidation.

McCoist agreed with that view and ahead of the match said: ‘Donald Findlay is a man I respect 100 per cent. I always have done and I always will do. Like everybody else, he’s entitled to his opinion.

‘His great friend Lord Nimmo Smith thought the opposite. So there you have two different opinions.

‘My opinion would lean towards Lord Nimmo Smith’s. I’m not going to get involved in a war of words with Donald, who I have far too much respect for.’

Findlay admitted that McCoist and coach Ian Durrant are two of the only faces he still knows at Ibrox after resigning as vice-chairman in ignominious circumstances in 1999 and, in a personal viewpoint, claims something is ‘missing’ at the club.

‘I think, like a lot of fans, Donald will be disappointed at what has happened,’ added McCoist. ‘Particularly in the last 24 months.

‘I understand that. There are a lot of fans who feel the same way, in that they feel they have lost a bit of identity, of their own relationship with the club because of what has happened.’

The Rangers boss has yet to speak to Derek Llambias, meanwhile, after a stock market announcement on Monday confirmed the appointment of Mike Ashley’s associate as a non executive Rangers director.

‘I haven’t heard anything at all,’ said McCoist. ‘I spoke to the chairman this morning when he told me about the appointment of a new director to the board.

‘That was fine, he was keeping me up to speed.’

SFA president Campbell Ogilvie revealed the governing body are poised for a sit-down with Ashley — as they seek further ‘clarification’ over his growing power at Ibrox.

Ogilvie, who revealed that the 10-per-cent limit on Ashley’s stake in the club extends to members of his family, said the issue of ‘influence’ was at the heart of their request for details.

Asked to provide a definition of ‘influence’, Ogilvie said: ‘I wouldn’t say it’s clear. A lot depends on the circumstances at any one time, the situation at the club.

‘That’s the very point we’re trying to get more information on, so I don’t want to second guess what kind of reply we’re getting.’
