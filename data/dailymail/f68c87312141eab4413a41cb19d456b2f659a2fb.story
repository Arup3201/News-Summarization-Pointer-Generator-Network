When it comes to the cinema sensation Gone Girl, it appears that most of us fall into one of two camps – those who have seen it, and those who are about to see it.

The thriller, which topped the UK film charts, taking £4.1million in its opening weekend, is the story of an unhappily married woman who goes missing – leaving her husband accused of murder.

At its heart is British beauty Rosamund Pike, 35, who plays Amy, the wife of Nick Dunne, portrayed by US star Ben Affleck, 41.

Gone Girl star Rosamund Pike, 35, said people have ridiculous expectations of their spouses nowadays

Even though she is not married herself, Miss Pike has revealed forthright views on matrimony during interviews about the movie.

The actress, who is expecting her second child with partner Robie Uniacke, said we demand too much of our spouses nowadays, telling Spectrum magazine: 'People have ridiculous expectations of a mate.

'In my grandmother's day, you wouldn't expect your husband to fulfil the same need in you as your sister, or girlfriends, or colleagues at work. You'd have different needs met by different people.

'Now we want all our needs met by one person, and I don't believe that's possible. Or rather, it is, but I don't think it's universally achievable.

'I do think separation is key to a relationship. I go out with my partner and we are put next to each other – there's a feeling of, 'What, you don't think we can't operate without each other?' I don't need him as a crutch. Of course, he's the person I want to go home with but he's not necessarily the person I want to sit next to. I'd rather meet someone new, and he would too.'

The success of the film – directed by David Fincher – puts it on course to become one of the biggest earners this year, and has catapulted Miss Pike to global fame. On Monday, it was one of the most talked-about topics on Twitter.

Speaking of the difficulty of rehearsing sex scenes with on-screen lover Neil Patrick Harris, 41, she told Glamour magazine: 'It was very funny. David left Neil and me alone for two hours to make sure we could do it. But when it's just two of you on a bed, it feels so inappropriate.'

Prior to meeting Robin, Rosamund was engaged to Pride & Prejudice director Joe Wright, but they split in 2008 when he called off their wedding plans.

In an interview soon after, she said: 'I still have no idea why Joe called off the wedding. He was never clear about it. Part of what makes it so confusing.

'I still think he's an extraordinary man, I really do.'
