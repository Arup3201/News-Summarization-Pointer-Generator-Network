The nephew charged with shooting hip-hop artist and reality TV star Benzino shot his uncle during his own mother's funeral procession out of self-defense, a court heard on Monday.

Gai Scott, 36, of Randolph, Massachusetts, pleaded not guilty in Plymouth District Court to armed assault with intent to murder after an argument broke out as the service was making its way through the streets of Duxbury, Massachusetts, on Saturday, headed for a church in Plymouth.

Scott shot 48-year-old Benzino - who was born Raymond Scott and is the former owner of hip hop magazine The Source - as the singer pulled up in his car at the cavalcade about 11.55am.

Sources say Scott was behind the wheel of his Bentley and pulled up alongside Benzino's red Dodge SUV and opened fire, striking him three times.

Benzino was taken to South Shore Hospital with non life-threatening injuries and was released on Monday.

Scott was held without bail pending a hearing Wednesday to determine whether he is a danger to society.

'When the dust settles with respect to this case, it's going to be abundantly clear that Mr. Scott, a licensed gun owner, was acting in self-defense and in defense of his family,' said Jon Ciraulo, Gai Scott's lawyer.

The Plymouth district attorney's office said in a statement that 'growing family tension' between the men was behind the shooting.

The funeral was for Benzino's mother, Mary Scott, who passed away on March 20, and resumed as usual after shooting, ending at St Peters Church.

Benzino posted pictured of himself on Instagram on Sunday, saying that he believes the hand of his mother saved him.

Bloody scene: Witnesses reported seeing blood stains on the hearse and limo in the motorcade after the shooting

‘Feel much better. God is real. My mother touched me I'm certain,’ he wrote online.

Father William Williams, who presided over the ceremony, recalled seeing blood on the vehicles in the funeral cortege.   

'I said to one of the guys, ''There's blood on the hearse’',' the clergyman told the WHDH news station.

Benzino said he had paid his respects to his mother in private at a Quincy funeral home but that he was not actually going to the funeral because of tensions in the family over money.

Benzino, a Boston native who now lives in Atlanta, said he was on his way to Plymouth to pick up a friend when he stumbled upon the procession and someone attacked him.

He did not identify the person who shot him by name.

Last week, Benzino took to Instagram to share photos of his late mother and talk about his grief and sense of loss, writing in one of the captions that he did not know how he will continue living knowing that Mrs Scott was gone. 

Benzino is best known for starting The
 Source magazine in 1988. A decade later, he joined the rap collective 
Made Men, and his other claim to fame is that the entertainer has been 
locked in a feud with Eminem for more than a decade. His net worth is 
estimated to be $10million.

Since
 2012, the 48-year-old rapper has been starring in Love and Hip Hop 
Atlanta, which premiered on VH1 that year as a spinoff of Love and Hip 
Hop New York.

The 
reality show follows the lives of more than a dozen local hip hop 
artists. The third season of the program will premiere in May.
