A public protest about paying employees penalty rates on public holiday by an Adelaide pub restaurant has attracted a torrent of negative feedback with punters taking to Facebook to vent their fury.

The Bombay Bicycle Club in Ovingham put up a sign outside its doors complaining they have to pay 2.75 per cent above the ordinary hourly rate of pay on public holidays, reported News.com.au.

They multiplied everything on the menu 2.75 times in an attempt to highlight the 'stupidity of the new rate.

Fed up: Adelaide's Bombay Bicycle Club put up a sign complaining about paying penalty rates

'The bread would be $19.25 under the cafe's calculations, while lamb korma was $65, salt and pepper squid $55, chicken schnitzel $48.50 and it would be more than $60 for a seafood pizza,' the sign read.

After getting negative feedback in person, the restaurant turned to Facebook to further explain its stance on penalty rates.

Its post claimed the increased penalty rates left employees worse off in some cases and would force venues to stay closed on public holidays, as was the case in Melbourne.

Backlash: Many people said that the pub was being unreasonable and should be willing to pay their workers the required rate

'So, by all means don't come back, and by all means complain about us pointing out the stupidity of a rate 2.75 times the norm but please don't insinuate disrespect by us to our employees,' it explained on Facebook.The message prompted a further backlash, attracting more than 300 comments, many of them critical.

'Bombay reminds us what we loved about slavery,' wrote one person. 'Here's a quick maths formula. Multiply zero (which equals the amount I will now spend at your establishment) by 2.75 and see what it equals,' wrote another.'Interesting to see that wages make up 100 per cent of your costs. While it must suck to have to compensate people for working when everyone else gets a holiday, it must be nice not to have to pay for rent, insurance, or food,' wrote another.An angry post declared, 'Pay penalty rates you bourgeois swine!'

'I will never be returning. How dare you treat your staff like they don't deserve decent wages and conditions,' David Pink wrote.

A handful of comments defended the business' right to highlight an issue

Later the Bombay returned to its Facebook page to apologise and later took down its sign from the front of the restaurant.

It claimed to regret the wording it used and that it didn't mean to cause offence.

'Too late. Your "opinion" has already spread across Facebook and beyond. Not going to be good for business,' one Facebook user wrote while another concluded, 'Damage has been done.'

The sign: Bombay Bicycle Club later removed this notice because it had caused such controversy
