If you are short of something to do this weekend and grimly looking forward to another night in front of the TV you are not alone.

Brits are much less happy with their social lives than most of Europe, according to new analysis of how we spend our free time.

People in the UK get less satisfaction from time partying or socialising than the likes of Luxembourg, Austria and Denmark.

Staying in: A new league table released in Parliament shows how the UK lags behind most of Europe for satisfaction with our social life

Figures released in Parliament reveal Denmark tops the European league table for socialising.

People in Turkey and Bulgaria, by contrast, are least happy with their lot.

Brits abroad might have a reputation for partying hard, but long working hours and raising children are taking their toll.

People across the continent were asked to rate how happy they were with 
their social life out of 10, with one being very dissatisfied and 10 
being very satisfied.

The UK average was only seven out of 10, almost 20 per cent lower than Denmark’s 8.3.

The figures, from the Office for National Statistics director general Glen Watson, were published by the Cabinet Office this month.

Contrast: Britain might boast some of the biggest clubs in the world, including Ministry of Sound in London (left), but people in Luxembourg (right) are happier with their social lives

Austria and Cyprus recorded 8.1, with Finland and Luxembroug on 7.8.

Anyone looking for a good time might want to give Bulgaria a miss, where people scored their social life at just 5.9 out of 10.

Experts suggest levels of satisfaction with social life could be linked 
to not having enough time because of work or family commitments.

New parents often fear that children will spell the end of their social life, and they could be right.

More than three-quarters of couples with no children are happy with how 
often they go out with friends, compared to just two-thirds of those 
with young children and half of single parents.

More than two-thirds of under-25s see their friends every day or most days, compared to just a third of people aged over 65.

Rows: Barely two-thirds of parents are happy with their social life, compared to three-quarters of couples without children

Earlier studies suggest a quarter of people in the UK are unhappy with 
the amount of leisure time they have, while 15 per cent are 'completely 
satisfied'.

And in an alarming warning, having a poor social life can be worse for your health than eating badly.

The Office for National Statistics points to research by the 
Universities of Exeter and Queensland, Australia which states: ‘The 
quality of a person’s social life could have an even greater impact than
diet and exercise on their health and well-being’.

Almost three quarters of those aged 16 to 24 and the over-55s are most satisfied with their social life, the ONS says.

This compares with 58 of those in the 35-44 age bracket, 62.1 per cent 
of those aged 45 to 54 and 63 of those aged 25 to 34-year-olds.
