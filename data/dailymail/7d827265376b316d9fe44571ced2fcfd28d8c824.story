A smiling Josef Kazzan, 9, who has died in a tragic accident in his garden in Cleckheaton, West Yorks

A nine-year-old boy died after he accidentally hanged himself on a play rope in his garden.

It is thought Josef Kazzan – known as Joe – was climbing the rope tied to a large tree when he slipped and his neck became trapped in a loop at the bottom.

Joe’s parents told yesterday how they found him caught in the rope and pulled him down to resuscitate him.

Paramedics managed to restart his heart but he died in hospital two days later.

His mother Rachel Cullen, 43, said the family has been left ‘broken’ by Joe’s death. They had been to church on the morning of Sunday, July 15, and were having lunch.

But Joe wanted to play outside because of the good weather. 

Miss Cullen said: ‘Joe loved playing in the garden, but it had been raining for weeks, so as soon as the sun came out he was desperate to play outside.’

The full-time mother of three, of Cleckheaton, West Yorkshire, said she was looking after Joe’s brother Sam, five, when she went to check on him.

‘I’m the sort of mum who’s always worrying about where my kids are, what they’re doing,’ she said.

‘I wondered where Joe had gone. It must have only been about five minutes since I saw him. I was looking around the house for him.’

She went out to the front gate and caught sight of her son in the tree as she turned around.

Neighbour Steve Rhodes described how Josef's mother battled to save the boy

Screaming in horror, she ran into the back garden.

Her partner Ahmed Kazzan, 61, and daughter Nadiah, 16, came out to help.

Miss Cullen said: ‘I ran out to the 
tree and clambered up to try and pull him down. I remember Ahmed came 
out and I passed Joe to him.’

The family called for an ambulance and began trying to resuscitate  the schoolboy.

Paramedics managed to restart his 
heart on the way to hospital in Dewsbury and he was transferred to Leeds
General Infirmary for more specialist care.

Mr Kazzan, an unemployed mortgage and
insurance agent, said he was told by a doctor Joe could survive 
although he may have suffered brain damage.

Keen footballer Josef was a pupil at St Patrick's Catholic Primary School, Birstall, 
West Yorks. Counsellors are understood to be helping staff and pupils 
with their grief

The father replied: ‘I don’t care, I want him home. If there is a chance, do what you can.’

But there was nothing the doctors 
could do and Joe’s life-support machine was switched off two days later 
with his family at his bedside.

Mr Kazzan said: ‘We decided to let him 
go in peace.’

Miss Cullen said: ‘I’m in shock. As a mother you just never ever think that this will happen to you. It doesn’t feel real.

‘I never left my kids alone. I can’t 
believe this happened when I turned my back for such a short period of 
time. I am just taking one hour at a time because I can’t even begin to 
think about life without Joe.

‘Joe was a beautiful, lovely boy. He 
was full of life and energy and loved being around people. He would win 
everyone over. He had loads of friends and was always wanting to call on
his friends. The family has been torn apart by this. The house is 
quiet, we are broken.’

Miss Cullen said Joe liked playing the
piano, swimming, and most of all football. He played for a local team 
and recently won an award voted for by the players’ parents.

Neighbour Steve Rhodes, 49, who ran to
help the family after hearing shouting, said Joe had been climbing the 
tree with the rope since he was a tiny boy.

‘It was Joe’s tree, he was always up 
it. His mum and dad made that garden for the children, it’s like a 
wonderland. My heart bleeds for the family. They are such a lovely 
family.’

Drighlington Juniors Football Club is 
organising a collection in Joe’s memory to go to the children’s ward at 
Leeds General Infirmary.
