Ashley Gardner is easing herself into motherhood. 

The Pleasant Grove, Utah woman whose priceless reaction to learning she was pregnant with quadruplets became a viral video, took home one of her four baby girls for the first time on Monday.

Ashley and Tyson Gardner's daughter Evangeline was the first of her sisters strong enough to leave the hospital and at one point slept a full four hours straight on her first night at home. 

But the Gardner's shouldn't get used to the calm. They expect their other three daughters Esme, Indie and Scarlett will be joining them at home soon when they can say goodbye to sleep.

Parenthood is a breeze! In a post on Tuesday, Mrs Gardner wrote that baby Evie had a rather peaceful first night at home, at one point sleeping sour hours straight

They are currently being cared for round-the-clock by nurses in the NICU at Utah Valley regional Medical Center in Provo. 

In an update on their Facebook page, Mrs Gardner wrote about the 'incredible' experience it was to finally take one of her babies home after giving birth in December. 

However, she says the moment was bittersweet since the couple had to leave their three other daughters behind. 

'I haven't stopped crying since we brought her home because of this incredible joy I am feeling,' Mrs Gardner wrote. 'But at the same time 3 pieces of our hearts are left behind at the NICU tonight. I know they aren't going to be too far behind Evangeline here but the thought of separating them made my soul ache!'

On Tuesday, Mrs Gardner detailed baby Evangeline's surprisingly peaceful first night at home. 

'Last night went great!!! Miss Evie just slept and cooed all night. There was even one stent where she slept for 4 straight hours! Yay! We are exhausted and so happy to be! 

'In the middle of the night when we were half asleep and I was feeding her she was making all these cute little grunting noises and we just started laughing. 

'We are so happy to have her home and to start learning how to juggle everything!' Mrs Gardner wrote. 

The Gardners first gained national attention in October, when they released photos showing Mrs Gardner's shocked expression when she learned they were having four babies during an ultrasound.

Unlikely: Ashley says that the chances of her conceiving the four girls - and them surviving to be born - is around 70million-to-one

The couple went on to become a national sensation, documenting their unique pregnancy on social media. 

'People identify with our story. There are hundreds, thousands of people that struggle with infertility,' Tyson Gardner said. 'Our story's a story of hope.'

 'It was scary at first, and then, you know, the second you see the babies' faces and hear them cry, it just is, it's all worth it,' Ashely Gardner said, according to the Deseret News. 

The quadruplets' survival was called a 'miracle' after emergency surgery was needed to stop  contractions when Ashley was around 20 weeks pregnant.

The couple flew to a specialist center at Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital, where Ashley was admitted for surgery in late October.  

Doctors managed to stave off the earlier delivery after an intense operation, which allowed the unborn babies vital extra weeks to bolster their chances of survival. 

Mr Gardner said doctors told his wife she needed immediate surgery after it appeared her cervix had started to open and she could be going into early labor. 

Surgeons also managed to cure two of the girls of their twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), which could have resulted in developmental problems.

Doctors made the decision to deliver the babies by C-section after Ashley started experiencing contractions a few weeks early in December. 

The Gardners posted a picture shortly before the birth of their girls with the message: 'Santa let the elves take over for a bit today so he could come visit us in the hospital!! #happy29weeks'

Proud new father Tyson Gardner posted this picture of his wife Ashley with the message: 'Moms saying Hello to Esme! Incredible day! God is real people!!'
