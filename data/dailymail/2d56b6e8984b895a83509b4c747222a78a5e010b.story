Covered in dirty clothes, plates and rubbish, this flat looks like it could be the home of a hoarder.

But a London estate agent is actually using the interior images of this messy flat in a bid to sell it.

The 'spacious' two-bedroom home in Tulse Hill, which Brooks Estate Agent says it 'could benefit from an upgrade' is on the market for £285,000 and proves that people in the capital will try and get their hands on almost anything, just to get their foot on the property ladder.

In one bedroom, boxes are piled up almost to the ceiling, while in the living room, litter has been spread out all over the floor.

The kitchen is covered in dirty plates, laundry and is littered with empty bottles and cans.

Messy: The kitchen in the London flat is covered in dirty plates, cups and litter. The estate agents urges the property only needs an 'upgrade'

In one of the bedrooms of the £285,000 property, boxes are piled up towards the ceiling with clothes spilling out of the top. A single armchair is covered in dirty clothes and two chest of drawers have been placed in front of each other

Location: The flat being sold by Brooks Estate has a garage and additional private storage room. It is also a short walk from Tulse Hill Undergound station

Messy: A TV stands in the corner of the living room which is covered in old papers, picture frames and even has a toilet roll on top of one of the piles

Improvement: One of the bedrooms is reasonably tidy, with the bed made and bags packed into a corner. However a blue plastic bag has been left on top of a chest of drawers

Space: The floor plan of the 'spacious' flat which includes dimensions of the storage basement and garage. The door opens out into an entrance hallway with the two bedrooms on the right
