A 31-year-old Mexican housewife has given birth to sextuplets - 12 years after she had quadruplets.

Salud Romero extended the size of her family on Thursday with four girls and two boys born by Caesarean section.

The babies, who weigh between 1.25 to 2lbs each, are in incubators and their condition is 'delicate'.

They are said to measure just 12 inches long.

Father Joshua Salinas, a 21-year-old labourer who earns between £60 and £95 a month, admitted they had not even got round to thinking about names for the babies.

He said: 'I feel very happy but also worried about their health and how we’re going to cope financially.

'We thought Salud was going to give birth to five children so the sixth caught us by surprise.

'We haven’t even thought of names for them yet. I’ll talk with Salud about that when the children are out of danger.'

Doctors decided to deliver the babies when Mrs Romero was just 27 weeks pregnant because of anaemia and an internal bleed.

Rosalba Martinez, a neo-natal specialist at the Women’s Hospital in Morelia, 200 miles west of the capital Mexico City where the babies are under constant observation in intensive care, said: 'The outlook for them is not great but we have the staff and tools we need here to do the best we can.'

Hospital director Yara Pineda added: 'Their health is delicate because they are underweight, because of their lack of pulmonary development and because of all the complications associated with artificial respiration.'

Mother-of-nine Mrs Romero gave birth to quadruplets 12 years ago.

Two of the children, fathered by a previous partner, survived and she went on to have another child with her current partner.

The world’s last set of sextuplets were born in October 2008 in the New York borough of Queens.

They were delivered by Caesarean section during mother Digna Carpio’s 25th week of pregnancy.

The Suleman octuplets, born in California in January 2009, are the longest-living octuplets in known history.
