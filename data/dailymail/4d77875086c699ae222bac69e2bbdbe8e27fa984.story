Busted: George Boedecker, 51, plead guilty to DUI in court yesterday after his bizarre arrest in Colorado last year

The founder of Crocs decided to change his 'not guilty' plea over a DUI arrest, and admitted in court yesterday that he was 'wasted' at the time.

George Boedecker, 51, plead guilty in a Boulder, Colorado, courtroom on Thursday, after he was pulled over in his Porsche and blamed his 'girlfriend' Taylor Swift for the incident, last August.

The entrepreneur has been sentenced to two years probation and 96 hours of community service, TMZ reported.

Police found Boedecker slumped over the wheel of the black Porsche in Boulder on August 12, and when cops decided to arrest him, he said: 'Go f**k yourselves in the a**.'

The bizarre confrontation with police also saw Boedecker allegedly blame country star Taylor Swift - who was thousands of miles away with her then boyfriend Conor Kennedy.

Police and paramedics said that when 
Boedecker got out of the car, which was partially on the sidewalk, he 
had trouble keeping his balance and was slurring his words.

A witness told police that Boedecker had gotten out of the car, and first said that he had pulled over to take a nap. 

He later changed his story completely, saying that his girlfriend had been driving, and she is 'bats*** crazy'.

Boedecker, whose other business ventures
include Domino's Pizza and Quizno’s, was approached by an officer, who 
asked what had happened.

A police report obtained by TheSmokingGun.com said that Boedecker told the officer that his girlfriend had been driving, and she ran away after the two had an argument.

When asked about the girlfriend, Boedecker told the officer that she is a singer who is 'really f****** famous.' He then asked if the officer had ever heard of Taylor Swift.

When the officer pressed for information about where the girlfriend went, Boedecker allegedly motioned toward a neighboring backyard, and then said 'Taylor' was in Nashville.

The officer wrote that Boedecker then became agitated, saying he was done with the questions that that things were about to get 'mid-evil'.

Wild claims: Boedecker is not believed to have ever been romantically linked to Taylor Swift

Shortly after that, Boedecker was 
arrested, but he apparently was not done talking, as the officer noted 
that the philanthropist told him and another responding officer to 'go 
f*** themselves in the a**' and that he hoped the cop would 'f****** 
die.'

Unfortunately for 
Boedecker and his story, Swift was in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, at 
the time of his arrest with her actual boyfriend Conor Kennedy and his 
family - about 2,000 miles away.

And
while Swift has dated such A-listers as Jake Gyllenhaal, Taylor 
Lautner, and John Mayer, there is no evidence to suggest she has ever 
been romantically linked to Boedecker.
