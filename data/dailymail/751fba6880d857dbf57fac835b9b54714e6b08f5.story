Germany saw off France in a dramatic World Cup quarter-final to book their place in the final four.

It took Mats Hummels just 12 minutes for Joachim Low's men to get going with a precise header that proved enough for Germany to win 1-0.

But how did the players get on individually? JOE CALLAGHAN gives his ratings.

GERMANY

Manuel Neuer: 7

Thirty-two years after Harald Schumacher grabbed the headlines against France, Neuer had a quieter afternoon.

Philipp Lahm: 7.5

Removed as defensive midfield pivot to steady a shaky defence, the captain thrived in more familiar ground.

Jerome Boateng: 6

Preferred to Per Mertesacker as Hummels' partner but still looked vulnerable to balls over the top.

Save: Manuel Neuer was strong in goal for Germany as per and helped them win with a clean sheet

Stop: Neuer kept Germany in the tie right up to the final few minutes when France threatened to equalise

Mats Hummels: 7

Was missed so badly against Algeria but returned here to contribute hugely. A superb header opened the scoring.

Benedikt Howedes: 6.5

Not in his natural role but continues to show little evidence of being uncomfortable as a full back.

Bastian Schweinsteiger: 7.5

Another to benefit from the Lahm switch, he revelled in being the quarterback again. Couple of key interceptions too.

Peace: Bastian Schweinsteiger (right) made key interceptions and looked comfortable as quarterback

Sami Khedira: 6

Not as busy as his defensive midfield partner but got through what work he had diligently. Deserved yellow card from cynical play.

Thomas Muller: 6.5

Removed from false nine duties to act as a deeper and wider foil in the attack but still an absolute pest.

Toni Kroos: 6.5

The man with the most completed passes in the tournament was at it again. Superb delivery for the opener.

Mesut Ozil: 6

Needed an upturn against Algeria and provided it. Carried that improved form here. Busy if a little isolated from play.

Miroslav Klose: 6

Low went horses for courses and finally called on his World Cup thoroughbred. Led the line energetically but threw in an awful dive too.

Manager Joachim Low: 8

Made some huge calls in team selection and saw one immediately justified with Hummels' goal.

Yellow cards: Khedira (54), Schweinsteiger (80)

Celebrate: Germany made the semi-finals after seeing off France in a tight encounter

FRANCE

Hugo Lloris: 6

Nothing the captain could do about Mats Hummels' header. Attempts at quick distribution came to little.

Mathieu Debuchy: 6

Marshalled Ozil relatively well. Tried to get forward plenty but got little change out of Howedes.

Raphael Varane: 5

Preferred to Laurent Koscielny but so easily out-muscled by Mats Hummels for the opener. Not a great day out.

In: Hugo Lloris dives to make a save but couldn't stop Mats Hummels from giving Germany the lead

Backtracking: Lloris could do nothing about Hummels' header and could not captain his side to victory

Mamadou Sakho: 5.5

Still struggles to convince that he's the £15million defender Liverpool thought they were getting. Nervy.

Patrice Evra: 6

Toiled at times against Nigeria but more solid here. Superb cross to Benzema before break deserved better.

Yohan Cabaye: 6

Withdrawn after 73 minutes of trying - but failing - to control operations in midfield. Lacked support but he's had better days. 

Beaten: Patrice Evra loses out on a header during France's loss to Germany in the quarter-final

Task: Yohan Cabaye was withdrawn after 73 minutes after trying - but failing - to control the game

Blaise Matuidi: 5.5

Blessed not to have been suspended for this one but he struggled to impose himself at times in the middle.

Paul Pogba: 6.5

Took it to the Germans with five first-half dribbles but we've already come to expect so much more. For him, a quiet day.

Mathieu Valbuena: 6

He might not make it much higher than the corner flag but he has really raised his game in Brazil. Not enough though.

Control: France crashed out of the World Cup in the quarter-finals but Germany make the final four

Heading home: Benzema couldn't find the back of the net, despite his last-gasp effort

Karim Benzema: 6

Drew back-to-back blanks after a red-hot start to the tournament but had chances to get back on the board here. Couldn't take them.

Antoine Griezmann: 5.5

Could have laid one on a plate for Benzema early on had he steadied himself. Little impact overall.

Manager Didier Deschamps: 6

Like his opposite number, made a change in central defence but it wasn't nearly as successful.

Yellow cards: NONE

Gutted: France crashed out of the World Cup at the hands of Germany and will be heading home

Frustrated: France manager Didier Deschamps could do little to lift his team to the World Cup semi-finals

Referee Nestor Pitana (Argentina): 7

Got two first-half penalty calls spot on. Otherwise was unfussy and happy to let things flow.
