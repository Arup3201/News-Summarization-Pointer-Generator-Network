Janet Brown, pictured, went missing in 2005, and was not able to make a claim on her parents' valuable estate

A man has been charged with the murder of a TV extra who went missing eight years ago.

Donald Graham, 59, has now been charged with the murder of Janet Brown, who has not been seen since June 2005.

Ms Brown, from Hexham, Northumberland, disappeared just before she was able to claim her parents’ estate - worth a reported £1million.

Graham, from Seaton Delaval, Northumberland, has also been charged with two counts of obtaining a money transfer by deception and 13 counts of fraud.

He is jointly charged with Elizabeth Todd, 51, for forgery, conspiracy to commit fraud, and perverting the course of justice.

Ms Brown, who was single, loved to travel and for that reason friends were not concerned when she first went missing.

Suspicisons were first raised when irregular activities were reported in her deceased parents’ bank account in 2009.

But since then extensive inquiries around the world, including in Thailand, have drawn a blank.

Ms Brown, who worked on the ITV show Distant Shores, never made a claim for her parents’ inheritance after they died.

Earlier this year officers from Northumbria Police searched a farm near Sparty Lea, in the remote North Pennines, for her body.

While the search was taking place, 
Detective Chief Inspector Nicola Musgrove,  said: ‘The police 
investigation commenced in 2009 after a report in relation to 
irregularities in the parents' bank account.

‘As a result of that we started looking for Janet Brown and after extensive enquiries to try to establish where she was, we've come to a point that we believe that she's dead and this is now being treated as a murder inquiry.

‘It has been a really difficult investigation. Since 2009 we've been trying to find some evidence that Janet Brown was still alive but I'm now satisfied that she is dead.

‘Her parents are both dead and there is an estate but she has never claimed the estate.'

A police spokesman said the pair would appear at Newcastle Magistrates’ Court later today.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
