Hardcore porn movies have been filmed at the top of an eight-storey council car park, just yards from the offices of town hall staff.

Police are investigating after Sutton Council, in south London, passed on footage of the explicit film after it was uploaded 
to an internet porn site last week.

The 11-minute professional video was shot in broad daylight and shows sex scenes on the top floor of the Gibson Road Car Park.

Police are investigating after hard core porn films were filmed on top of a Sutton Council-owned car park

It
is understood there are other films in circulation on the internet 
which have also been shot at the car park opposite the council offices.

As many as three professional blue movies may have been shot at the council car park in the past few weeks.

Conservative councillor Tony Shields, who was told about the films by a 'furious' resident, 
said: 'I
have seen it and it is about as explicit as it gets. It wasn't a kiss 
and a cuddle. If you were coming back to your car with your shopping it 
would be very shocking.

'The
informants showed me the video on their doorstep on a tablet while I 
was out canvassing. They have subsequently contacted me to tell me there
are not one but three videos.'

Police
are investigating to see if any offences have been committed through 
the filming and councillors
have demanded a review of security at the car park.

It is illegal to film on council property without its 
permission.

The film shows a
taxi driving around the borough with a 'client' in the back seat and 
the civic offices can clearly be seen in the background.

In later explicit scenes outside of the car in the car park, which has CCTV, the Sutton skyline is clearly visible.

A
still image from the film shows a woman in the back of a cab, and a 
subtitle that reads: 'So maybe I'll have you first and him after.'

A
police spokesman said: 'The council passed a web link to the police who
are working with the council to identify any offences. Appropriate 
action will be taken.'

Councillor
Shields, who has demanded a council investigation into security at the 
car park, said: 'It is tempting to liken this situation to a "Carry On" 
film maybe "Carry On up the car park" but in reality it is profoundly 
concerning to see that hard core pornographers feel safe to make a very 
explicit film in broad daylight at a public car park.'

He
also questioned whether other illegal activities could be taking place 
there and whether it was safe for people using the car park.

He
said: 'I did not think Sutton was a favoured porn film location but it 
seems it is rather the porn capital and Gibson Road car park is the film
set.'

A 
council spokesman said: 'The Safer Neighbourhood Team has been made 
aware of the incident and will make sure their patrols pay attention to 
the car park.

'Albeit that 
this incident is not related to any security issues as it involved a 
taxi driving into our car park during daylight hours, we have undertaken
a full safety review of this car park over recent months and have 
installed a range of security measures including fitting a safety 
barrier on the top level and installing gates and grilles to prevent 
out-of-hours access as well as treating walls with anti-climb paint.'
