The NHS that has served us so well for 60 years is in crisis. The current model is no longer sustainable. We are living longer and that means our bodies become harder to maintain. 

Many of us who are 60 now will die with at least three different conditions – and the State simply does not have the money to cope. 

At the current rate of growth, spending on healthcare will rise from 8.2 per cent of GDP to 20 per cent over the coming years unless action is taken.

Former chief executive of Marie Curie, Sir Thomas Hughes-Hallett has said the NHS is no longer suited to our aging population

We think of free healthcare as our national birthright – but how much do we really need? The  brutal answer has to be: a lot less.

The NHS will be fundamentally threatened unless non-essential services become the responsibility of communities, charities  and individuals – and unless people are prepared to pay for some of them. I have just spent nine months talking to people in Essex about their care and its future.

Their need is great – the number of people needing social care in Essex will grow from 35,000 now to 137,500 by 2030. And what they told me was astounding.

In Pitsea, I was told: ‘It is the individual who is responsible for their own health – not the Government.’

In Braintree, a young mother couldn’t understand why the State funds her maternity care when she made a choice to get pregnant – yet doesn’t fund the care of her elderly next-door neighbour.

In Clacton-on-Sea, people told me that they would rather see their local hospital closed and the money reinvested in community services.

First port of call: People should make better use of their local pharmacies says Sir Hughes-Hallett

As an experiment we gave two representative groups of 50 people £3.5 billion in virtual money to spend on health and social care, and they did something extraordinary.

They cut spending on hospitals, drugs and services offered by GPs – and reallocated funds to support community services and pharmacies. Why pharmacies? Because they’re convenient and often open when surgeries are not.

A staggering 40 per cent of people in Basildon and Braintree use the pharmacy (or Google) as their first port of call.

In Benfleet they didn’t ‘have a  clue’ where to get help. A carer in Chelmsford told me that he had  a bewildering choice of 28 local  organisations and charities offering support.

And children in Chelmsford offered to give up an episode of EastEnders each week to have time to care for an elderly lady in their street.

These good people of Essex have one thing in common. They want to take back control of their own health. They just need the support of the State to do so.

I have briefed ministers, NHS England and the Department of Health, because what we’ve learned from the process will have national implications. And the reaction has been very positive, at the highest level. So by 2016 if you live in Essex and are worried, say, by a recurring back pain, you will be able to . . .

l Use a health ‘TripAdvisor’ and ‘satnav’ to find the best help, which might be from the chemist and not the GP.

l Ask someone in your community  to drive you to the GP – who will  now offer care that you used to get only at A&E. 

l Know that if you think you need a  massage, and it is not a clinical  necessity, the State will not provide it – but your neighbour might.

l Pay to receive immediate non-urgent care.

l Talk to your ‘buddy’ if you’re vul-nerable. 

l Accept that if you go to A&E unnecessarily, you are depriving someone else of urgent care.

In all my years working with patients  – 12 of them with Marie Curie Cancer Care and after that with Lord Darzi at the Institute of Global Health Innovation – I have never heard more compelling arguments for change articulated by the very people who will be most affected by it. 

A new partnership at a local level between citizens and those who currently provide their care is the best solution to the impending crisis.

1. A new understanding between the public sector and the people . . .

I
will take responsibility for my own health – you, the State, will help 
me to do so. You will give me access to a health ‘TripAdvisor’ – where I
can find the best care – and a health ‘satnav’ that tells me how I can 
access these services. Don’t assume I’m not  prepared to pay for some of
these – I pay for repairs to my car, so why not to my body?In return, you will give more support and recognition to my informal carer.And you will always be there for me in a crisis – 24/7.

2. Identify vulnerable people well before they reach that crisis point . . .

I want people to notice if I have started to fall over repeatedly – not just when I’ve broken my hip. Astonishingly,
GPs cannot warn the fire service about patients whose mobility problems
put them at greater risk in a fire. Why? Because of data protection 
laws.Everyone who is vulnerable should have a care plan, with 
information about their needs, as a human right. And a named ‘buddy’ – a
district nurse, or a neighbour – to help them.

3) Mobilise our most precious asset – the communities we live in.

We
need to create an entire new awards scheme for our most compassionate 
citizens. We need a new organisation to recruit, train and support 
volunteers who will take responsibility for a number of households. You may not want a Lynda Snell of The Archers on your street, but a nosy neighbour would at least keep an eye out for you.

4)
Use data. Do you know why so many hospitals ask you to bring your drugs
with you? It’s the only way they can be sure what you’re taking. Your 
GP knows, but doesn’t always share the information. On the Isle of Wight
they’re piloting a smartcard loaded with all your details, so that you 
don’t have to repeat it to five different members of staff.

5) Get 
round a table with one pot of money and design the best care package for
me. In Essex, there are five or even six pots of money all controlled 
by different people, some in Essex, some in London.

This isn’t 
wishful thinking. In Essex, it is going to happen. Last Thursday David 
Finch, leader of Essex Council, confirmed he will be asking the local 
health and wellbeing board to plan for adoption of our recommendations. 
And it shouldn’t cost Essex a penny more (since one of our 
recommendations is that for every service created another must be 
closed).
