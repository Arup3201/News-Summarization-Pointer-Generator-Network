The new iPad has proved to be another hot-seller, with thousands of fans queuing up all night at shops across the world to get their hands on the tablet.

The sales are doing wonders for Apple's share price, which hit $600 for the first time just as the new iPad launched.

So, if you have the cash to spend, you have a choice - one new iPad, or one share in Apple.

Joy of the purchase: Zohaib Ali was first in the long line of eager iPad buyers - all helping to buoy Apple's share price

It is another milestone figure for Apple - which has $97.6billion of cash in the coffers.

Two weeks ago the tech giant became more valuable than the entire nation of 
Poland, with the company's stock value soaring past $500billion.

The buzz of the latest launch helped propel Apple's share price to a high of $600.01 before easing back slightly to $585.56.

The peak came half an hour after the first iPad went on sale in Australia, extending the market worth of the world's most valuable company to almost $560 billion.

What you've been waiting for? After months of speculation, and a week of anticipation, the iPad hits the shelves

Only a month earlier, the stock price had crossed $500 for the first time, and the Â£100 jump means Apple's stock has risen 45 per cent this year.

With Thursday's closing price of $585.56, Apple's share price is far more expensive than the $499 starting price for a WiFi iPad in the U.S.

The new iPad goes on sale today in 10 countries, including the United States, Canada, Singapore, France and Britain, with diehards lining up overnight in front of Apple stores in Munich, Paris, London, Singapore and Hong Kong.

Wall Street expects a strong start for the latest iPad and some analysts even expect sales of the current model to overtake the iPad 2. Apple will continue to sell the iPad 2 but dropped its price by $100 to start at $399.

Apple may sell 65.6 million iPads, according to an estimate by Canaccord Genuity analysts, who also raised their target price on Apple stock to $710 from $665.

So far, the company has sold 55 million iPads since it was launched in 2010.

Apple become only the sixth company in history to soar past half a trillion dollars on March 7.

Apple's value was $506bn - in contrast to Poland, with a population of 38 million people, which has a GDP figure of just $497bn.

The company, co-founded by Steve Jobs, is also worth more than Belgium, Sweden, Saudi Arabia and Taiwan.

Apple's value only overtook Microsoft in May 2010 - but since then their ascent has been rapid.

Microsoft saw their value hit $600bn in 2000 - but after losing their dominance they are now worth just $267bn.

Steve Jobs: The Apple leader remembered the lean times of the 1990s

Cisco Systems, Intel and General Electricity also peaked just above $500bn in early 2000. Cisco and Intel are now worth a bit more than $100bn each, while GE is worth $200bn.

CEO Tim Cook told shareholders at the annual meeting that the company has more money than it needs, and the board and management are thinking 'very deeply' about ways to use the cash.

Former CEO Steve Jobs, apparently haunted by the company's lean years in the 1990s, had a policy of accumulating cash and the company now sits on a war chest worth $97.6billion.

China's largest oil company, PetroChina, was briefly worth $1trillion after it listed on the Shanghai stock exchange in 2007, but only based on its price on that exchange.

Its shares also trade in Hong Kong and on the New York Stock Exchange. Based on trading there, its market capitalization has never reached $500bn.

Apple's iPhone business is now bigger than the whole of Microsoft, according to recent revenue figures.

The company's smartphone division generated $24.4 billion of revenue in the quarter up until December, whereas the whole of Microsoft generated $20.9 billion in the same quarter.

That includes entertainment devices such as Xbox, as well as Windows, Microsoft Office and Windows Phone.
