New lord of the manor: Nicholas Johnston, an old Etonian chum of David Cameron, the Prime Minister, has bought an entire coastal village in Devon

An old Etonian chum of the Prime Minister has been revealed as the mystery buyer of an entire coastal village in Devon.

Nicholas Johnston, 42, fought off a rival bid from the National Trust to snap up the Bantham Estate in Devon, which was on the market for £11.5million.

His family already control the Great Tew Estate in Oxfordshire, where he hosts the annual Cornbury music festival, regularly attended by David Cameron and nicknamed 'Poshstock' for its moneyed attendees.

Until now the identity of the Bantham Estate's new owner had been shrouded in secrecy, with the sellers only speaking to deny rumours the buyer was a Russian oligarch or an investment firm.

The current owner is Evans Estates, a family-owned company formed by the descendants of Lieutenant Commander Charles Evans who began buying up Bantham in 1918.

Today the 728-acre estate includes of a village shop, a golf course, a mooring, a thatched boathouse on the River Avon, an oyster farm and the grand-sounding Lordship of the Manor of Bigbury, the Sunday Telegraph reports.

It also includes ownership of Bantham beach, various properties in and around the village of Bantham, and is responsible for managing the Bantham harbour facilities.

The National Trust had put in a bid for part of the land in an attempt to protect its coastline.

Barbara Tucker, who runs the village shop, told the Sunday Telegraph she was relieved to learn Mr Johnston would be the new lord of the manor.

'I have heard of the Tew Estate and it's pretty well run, so it sounds like we won't have to worry,' she said. 'If he has run an estate nicely and properly maybe that will be better for us - maybe he will put those ideas into practice here.'

She added that she will have to look him up so she would be able to recognise him.

Mr Johnston's enterprises at Great Tew include a farm, a quarry and a large property portfolio. External firms also use the estate's 4,000 acres to offer shooting classes and rally driving lessons.

Each year Mr Johnston and his wife also host the Cornbury Music Festival, which you may not have heard of but is almost-annually haunted by the Prime Minister, his family, and other members of the well-heeled Chipping Norton set including Jeremy Clarkson and Rebekah Brooks, the former editor of the News Of The World.

Last year Mr Cameron raised eyebrows with his choice of attire as he walked around the site barefoot and appeared to be sporting a pair of fake Ray-Ban sunglasses after enjoying a private lunch with the Johnstons.

The festival boasts music across four stages and also has an exclusive VIP area.

On the festival’s website, the 'eclectic and eccentric' event is described as a 'dynamic summer festival disguised as a country fayre - a lovingly crafted, top notch, very English open air party, tailor-made for the whole family'.

The site adds: 'Like the best of England, Cornbury is eccentric, charming and irresistible - a homespun melting pot where music-lovers share pies and a glass of champagne with superstars, toffs, rockers, crooners, Morris dancers, farmers, urbanites, fashionistas, gourmet chefs and the little old ladies who make exceptional cakes.'

Actress Tina Hobley - formerly of TV drama Holby City - was also spotted among festival-goers.

The Bantham Beach website says the ethos of the current owners 'has always been to allow Bantham to remain a place of outstanding beauty, with the village’s old thatched cottages portraying an image of unchanging charm and the beach and its surrounds staying as wild and natural as can be.'

It adds: 'Evans Estates has consistently set its face against commercialisation of the beach. It is determined that families should continue to enjoy a peaceful day out in an unspoilt environment.'

A source with knowledge of the sale, which is yet to be signed and sealed, told the Sunday Telegraph 'obviously different owners will do different things' but denied Mr Johnston was pursuing any of the 'mad ideas' that have circulated as rumours in the locality.

The sale is being handled by Strutt & Parker, which declined to comment on Mr Johnston's plans for the estate.
