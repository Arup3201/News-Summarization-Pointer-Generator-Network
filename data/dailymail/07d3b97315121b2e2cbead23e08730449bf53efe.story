Hundreds of thousands of savers who have built up small pension pots are to receive a major boost from George Osborne in next week’s Budget.

The Chancellor will relax rules to enable retirees with modest nest eggs to take them as cash lump sums, the Mail has learned.

The move would help those who are currently forced to turn small savings into a regular income known as an annuity when they stop work.

Savers: Those with less than £15,000 in their pension pots will be able to convert the amount into cash

Mr Osborne’s reforms are expected to benefit up to 150,000 savers a year who have built up pension pots of less than £15,000, usually having been in a job for only a few years.

Many get a poor deal when they are forced to use it to buy an annuity – a form of insurance – even if it only pays out a few pounds a week.

Change: It is understood the rules will be introduced by the Chancellor George Osborne

They also have little choice when they try to shop around for a better deal, since many insurers will not accept savings so small.

The Chancellor’s Budget reform, to allow people to convert such pension pots into cash, is a victory for the Daily Mail’s ‘Stop the Great Pensions Rip-off’ campaign which called for the change.

The move is also a response to repeated Labour attacks on the £12billion-a-year annuity industry, which has been criticised for a lack of clarity on charges to consumers.

Under existing rules, only those approaching retirement with less than £18,000 in total pension savings can avoid buying an annuity and take their fund as cash instead.

But many workers have had several employers, and built up pension savings from each job – which when added together take them over  the threshold.

A third of the 335,000 annuity sales last year were for sums of less than £10,000, though they are usually unable to secure similar value to those who have saved more.

A recent analysis by City regulator the Financial Conduct Authority found that individuals with pension pots in the range of £50,000 to £100,000 could buy pensions worth as much as 50 pence per pound more than those with a pot of £5,000 or less.

A 65-year-old with a nest  egg of £5,000, for example, would receive a retirement income of just  £5 per week.

The FCA has expressed concern that small pensions savers are being placed at risk by the requirement to use their savings to buy an annuity.

Floored: Many savers who were only in a job for a few years get a poor deal on their pension

Those who have small sums dotted around among previous employers will also pay duplicate charges if they have to buy an annuity.

The Chancellor’s measure will allow ordinary workers to access small pension pots directly and make their own choices about how they invest it or spend it, rather than handing control over to annuity salespeople.

Tom McPhail, a pensions expert at financial services firm Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ‘It is very hard for investors with such small pots to get good value from their pension fund.’

The Association of British Insurers, which represents the country’s leading pension providers, has also said it supports reform.

Other key expected moves in next week’s statement include an attempt to underline Tory claims to be the true ‘workers’ party’ with another increase in the personal tax allowance, cutting tax bills for millions by at least £100 a year, and further cuts to the welfare budget.

The Chancellor is also poised to extend emergency tax breaks offered to small and medium-sized businesses that were introduced by the Coalition during the recession as a means of kick-starting Britain’s ailing economy.

COMMENTARY BY JAMES CONEY, MONEY MAIL EDITOR

Turning a pension into an income for life using an annuity can seem desperately poor value at the best of times. But for anyone with a pot of less than £15,000 the returns can be rotten. A 65-year-old with £10,000 of savings would get an income of just £7.50 a week.

And pound for pound these small savers are worse off than those who convert bigger pensions into  an annuity.

Of the 353,000 pensions turned in to an income last year, 100,700 were by people who had savings of less than £10,000. They shouldn’t have to.

Many retiring workers today have had several 
employers, and been left with scraps of pensions from all these 
different jobs. In some 
cases they’ve got two from the same company, after a final salary scheme
 was shut down and replaced with one linked to the stock market.

Anyone with a pot this small ought to be allowed to have their money back as cash.

A lump sum could help them pay off a debt, make home improvements, or bolster their other savings – an annuity of £7 a week is going to make little or no difference to their lifestyle. It just lines the pockets of insurers a little bit more.

The reason so many take an annuity they don’t want is because they are hampered by antiquated pension rules. Now, the Chancellor looks set to offer them help.

This Government has been accused of fiddling too much with pensions – but this is the kind of tinkering that is necessary and welcomed.

A particular problem has been the changing face of Britain’s workforce and the retirement schemes employees are offered. Many retiring workers today have had several employers, and been left with scraps of pensions from all these different jobs.

In some cases they’ve got two from the same company, after a final salary scheme was shut down and replaced with one linked to the  stock market.

It is these final salary benefits that typically push savers over a limit which prevents them from taking their smaller pots of cash.

Allowing those with slightly bigger pots to discount their final salary benefits and cash in their small savings in defined contribution schemes is a practical step which will help 150,000 people.

This rule change is likely to cost the Treasury nothing – it will still pull in the same amount of tax – but could be a valuable lifeline for hundreds of thousands of those who just want  to get a better deal for their  life savings.
