A United Airlines airliner carrying more than 230 passengers have been forced to make an emergency landing after a fire broke out on board the plane.

The Boeing 777, which was flying from Newark to Brussels, was forced to divert to Canada's Halifax Stanfield International Airport Tuesday night.

Peter Spurway, the 
spokesman for the Halifax Airport Authority, said the fire was in a 
contained area and was extinguished prior to the emergency landing just before 10pm.

The pilot of United Airlines Flight 999 decided to land at the nearest available airport, he said.

Airport Fire and Halifax Regional Fire units met the aircraft on the 
tarmac, but the flight crew had already contained and extinguished the 
fire.

The plane with 233 people on board had been on a flight from New Jersey to Brussels.

All passengers and crew members on board were safely evacuated without injury or incident, and are set to board a replacement aircraft.

The aircraft will now be inspected by United Airlines authorities as well as Transport Canada.

Flight 999 from Newark to Brussels is a regularly scheduled flight.
