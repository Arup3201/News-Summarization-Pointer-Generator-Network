The breastfeeding equipment vending machine, which has been installed at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore

Instead of offering drinks and snacks, a vending machine thought to be the first of its kind to offer breastfeeding equipment has been installed at a Baltimore hospital.

The machine stocks 14 different types of items including pump accessories, storage bottles and everything else working mothers need to breastfeed their babies.

The machine, which took a year to develop has been up and running at the hospital for a little over a month, where it is reported that business has been steady.

The idea to create the vending machine with a difference came from Meg Stoltzfus, an employee at the hospital working in the human resources department.

And with staff at the hospital having to work unusual hours, she says that it can be a big problem when they have to pump milk during a shift.

Walking through an airport she noticed a large number of items for sale in vending machines and she came up with a solution, according to the Baltimore Sun.

She then set about putting her idea into practice, which resulted in the new machines.

She told the newspaper: 'I worked and pumped as well, so I've made it sort of a mission to help other moms.

'You can get a vending machine company to build you a vending machine to do just about anything.'

Working mothers wanting to use the machine just swipe their credit card and then select the product they need.

In 
addition the machine is linked to the computer of Ms Stoltzfus, meaning 
that when it items start to run low, it reminds her to order in more.

The machines stock 14 different types of items, meaning working mothers can find everything they need to breastfeed their babies

The new vending machines are part of the hospital's Breastfeeding Support Program, which helps nursing mothers when returning to work.

The hospital has 14 dedicated nursing rooms, with the hospital revealing they are visited 23,000 times a year.

If the machine proves popular, more could be rolled out in the hospital's other nursing rooms.
