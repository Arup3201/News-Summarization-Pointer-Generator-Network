Dreams of Downtin: Actress Anjelica Huston has said she would love a role in the hit British series

American actress Anjelica Huston says she is 'slathering' to star in Downton Abbey.

The Academy Award winner and daughter of legendary director John Huston has said she 'loves' the show and gets very emotional watching it.

In an interview with Times Magazine, she said: 'I would be slathering to work on 
Downton. I love it. I like manners and behaviour — and to 
me, that’s a very satisfying show. I get very involved [and] emotional.'

The Hollywood 
actress is the latest in a long list of high-profile performers who have hinted they want to star in one of the most successful programmes on British television.

Recently, superstar Joan Collins said she wanted to play Lady Cora - a role that went to Shirley MacLaine.

Some actors have been luckier and have made it to the abbey. This series, Dame Kiri Te 
Kanawa played opera singer Nellie Melba and Golden Globes winner Paul 
Giamatti has also starred.

British actors in Dame Harriet Walter, Nigel Havers and Tim 
Pigott-Smith have also starred in the show - the fourth series of which finishes tomorrow night.

The highly anticipated Christmas special will air in December.

As usual, Julian Fellowes’ drama has seen numerous dramas - including the Dowager Countess of Grantham, played by Dame Maggie Smith, suffering from a nasty cough.

But, according to bookmakers, the legendary actress is not the most popular choice to meet a dramatic end very soon - with odds currently at 7-1.

Scheming footman Thomas Barrow is 5-2 according to bookmakers William Hill to be the next character to die.

John
Bates - the valet released from jail after being convicted, wrongly, 
for the murder of his first wife - is 9-2 to face the death penalty 
should he take revenge on the servant who raped his second wife Anna 
this series.

Lady Mary and Tom Branson are both 25-1 to be killed, while pregnant Lady Edith is the rank outsider at 33-1.

However, the series executive producer has said that that no one will die in this year’s Christmas special following the traumatic death of Matthew last year.

Footman Thomas Barrow is 5-2

Valet John Bates 9-2

Lady Mary 25-1

Former chauffeur Tom Branson 25-1

Lady Edith 33-1

Dan Stevens, who played Matthew, is one of several actors cashing in on the series' success - having made four films since he was killed off 12 months ago.

Similarly, Jessica Brown Findlay, who played Lady Sybil - is involved in five films currently.

Hugh Bonneville - otherwise known as the Earl of Grantham - will appear in The Monuments Men with George Clooney while his on-screen daughter Michelle Dockery, Lady Mary, will soon be in Non-Stop alongside Liam Neeson.

The fourth series drew a peak audience of 10.5 million when it was aired two months ago, with nine million regularly watching. Iran and Serbia are the latest of 100 countries that tune in to the series
