People around the world are uniting for 'Malala and the 32 million girls day' in honour of injured Pakistani schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai as part of a global day of action for girls' education.

It is part of a drive led by former prime minister Gordon Brown, UN Special Envoy for Global Education.

He has presented a petition to 
Pakistan president Asif Ali Zardari, along with one million signatures 
from Pakistan, demanding free and compulsory education.

In London, schoolboy David Crone, 17, will hand 
in a petition, which calls for every child to have the right to go to 
school, to the Pakistan High Commission.

Today marks exactly one month since 15-year-old education campaigner Malala was shot in the head by a Taliban gunman as she travelled home from school with two classmates in north-west Pakistan.

Malala is now recovering at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham after being flown to the UK for treatment a week after the shooting.

She has become a symbol of courage and received thousands of goodwill messages.

The public is being encouraged to show their support for today by using social networking sites to post messages.

Youth representatives worldwide are handing in the 'I am Malala' petition, which has already attracted more than one million signatures.

Mr Brown said: 'The president of Pakistan has agreed to work with the United Nations to ensure urgent delivery of education for all and to get Pakistan’s five million out-of-school children into education for the first time.

'No bombs, bullets, threats or intimidation can deter the international community, working in partnership with Pakistan, to ensure we build the schools, train teachers, provide learning materials, and ensure that there is no discrimination against girls.'

Mr Brown announced that three million children in poor families in Pakistan will now receive cash in return for going to school.

He also set a goal with Mr Zardari to ensure that every girl and boy will have a quality education with teachers, books and classrooms by 2015.

The latest Unesco figures show that 61 million children worldwide are not in school - 32 million of whom are girls - and that Pakistan has the second largest number of girls out of school in the world.

In Pakistan today, Mr Brown met two of Malala’s friends who were injured in the attack in Pakistan.

He said there was now a real momentum for change in the country.

'I believe that in Pakistan, the silent majority is speaking and that there is now a national consensus that the country can delay no longer in ensuring girls and boys have schools to go to and teachers to teach them,' Mr Brown said.

'This has been a breakthrough moment for Pakistan and now we must turn Pakistan’s new ambitions and popular determination into delivery on the ground.'
