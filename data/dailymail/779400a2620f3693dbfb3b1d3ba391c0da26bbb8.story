President Obama's dramatic change of heart on the issue of gay marriage today sent shockwaves through the political world - and a boatload of cash into his campaign war chest.

After Obama's shock announcement last night, his re-election crusade saw a massive spike in donations as gay donors lined up to pour money into his campaign.

BuzzFeed reported that Obama's campaign collected an astonishing $1million within 90 minutes after the ABC News interview aired.

But while gay rights advocates applauded Obama's announcement on Wednesday, Republicans
accused the commander-in-chief of pulling off a cynical political 
manoeuvre.

Change of heart: President Barack Obama said he once thought civil unions were sufficient rights for gay couples, but he no longer believes that

Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus accused Obama of placating to voters.

Priebus said in a statement: 'While President Obama has played politics on this issue, the Republican Party and our presumptive nominee Mitt Romney have been clear.

'We support maintaining marriage between one man and one woman and would oppose any attempts to change that.'

Obama's announcement yesterday opened up the first major battleground in this year's election campaign.

Romney himself did not swipe at Obama directly, but affirmed his own views on same-sex unions during an Oklahoma campaign stop, saying: 'I believe that marriage is between a man and a woman.'

Historic: Obama is the first sitting U.S. President to publicly support gay marriage. President George W Bush opposed it and President Bill Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage act into law

Obama was also rebuked by Log Cabin Republicans, who also accused the president of playing politics and questioned the timing of his remarks.

Log Cabin Republicans Executive Director R. Clarke Cooper said in a statement: 'That the president has chosen today, when LGBT Americans are mourning the passage of Amendment 1, to finally speak up for marriage equality is offensive and callous.

'Log Cabin Republicans appreciate that President Obama has finally come in line with leaders like Vice President Dick Cheney on this issue, but LGBT Americans are right to be angry that this calculated announcement comes too late to be of any use to the people of North Carolina, or any of the other states that have addressed this issue on his watch.

'This administration has manipulated LGBT families for political gain as much as anybody, and after his campaign’s ridiculous contortions to deny support for marriage equality this week he does not deserve praise for an announcement that comes a day late and a dollar short.'

1996, running for Illinois State Senate: 'I favor legalizing same-sex marriages,and would fight efforts to prohibit such marriages.'

2004, running for U.S. Senate in Illinois: 'My religious faith dictates marriage is between a man and a woman, gay marriage is not a civil right.'

2008, running for U.S. President: 'I believe marriage is the union between a man and a woman. As a Christian it's also a sacred union.'

2010, after Republican wave election: 'My feelings with this are constantly evolving, I struggle with this.'

2012, running for reelection: 'I think same sex couples should be able to get married.'

Others, like House Speaker John Boehner, said there are more pressing issues at hand.

Boehner told the Fox Business Network: 'I have always believed that marriage was between a man and a woman. But Republicans here on Capitol Hill are focused in on the economy.'

The president appears to be banking 
on the gay marriage issue, which is heavily supported by younger Americans, to 
mobilize the youth vote, which has become disaffected during his term in
office.

Obama had long been suspected of 
holding this view, but was thought to be afraid to make it public 
because of the political backlash.

The
revelation comes the day after voters in the key battleground state of 
North Carolina approved a strict new ban on same-sex marriage.

The measure, which prohibits any civil or domestic benefits for gay couples, passed by a landslide with 61 percent of the vote.

'At a certain point I’ve just 
concluded that for me personally it is important for me to go ahead and 
affirm that I think same sex couples should be able to get married,' the
president said.

Obama claims the change is a personal
one only, and that he he still believes the issue of gay marriage 
should be left up to the states.

Currently, six states allow gay couples to wed and 30 states have constitutional amendments explicitly banning it.

Obama said his daughters and their friends were a major reason he changed his mind about gay marriage.

'You know, Malia and Sasha, they have
friends whose parents are same-sex couples. There have been times where
Michelle and I have been sitting around the dinner table and we’re 
talking about their friends and their parents and Malia and Sasha, it 
wouldn’t dawn on them that somehow their friends’ parents would be 
treated differently,' he said.

'It doesn’t make sense to them and frankly, that’s the kind of thing that prompts a change in perspective.'

Obama had been under intense pressure
to clarify his view toward gay marriage after Vice President Joe Biden publicly announced he supported it on Sunday.

The White House sought out the interview with Robins Roberts, the 'Good Morning America' host, to explain himself.

Parts of the interview will aired 
tonight on 'World News Tonight' and will also appear on Thursday 
morning's 'Good Morning America.'

Roberts, herself, has never married.

Obama
seems to be making an election-year political gamble by directly 
challenging Romney, his likely Republican opponent in November.

'When these issues were raised in my state of Massachusetts I indicated my view, which is I do not favor marriage between people of the same gender and I don't favor civil unions if they are identical to marriage other than by name,' he told KDVR-TV in Denver.

'My view is that domestic partnership benefits, hospital visitation rights and the like are appropriate but the others are not.'

It could be that Obama is hoping to use the issue to energize young voters, who support gay marriage by way margins.

The president, himself, acknowledged the issue is a generational one.

'You know when I go to college campuses, sometimes I talk to college Republicans who think that I have terrible policies on the economy, on foreign policy, but are very clear that when it comes to same sex equality or, you know,  believe in equality. They are much more comfortable with it,' he said in the interview.

Last week, Romney's spokesman for foreign policy, Richard Grenel, quit the campaign after he came under fire from some conservatives for being openly gay. 

Recent
polls show 50 per cent of Americans support gay marriage, but also 
reveal that the 45 percent who oppose it have strong convictions.

This
could explain plain why North Carolina's Amendment 1, which changes the
state constitution to prohibit gay marriage and partnership benefits to
gay couples, won by such a wide margin among voters.

Biden's remarks on Sunday set the stage for Obama's announcement.

'I am absolutely comfortable with the fact that men marrying men, women marrying women and heterosexual - men and women marrying - are entitled to the same exact rights, all the civil rights, all the civil liberties. And quite frankly, I don’t see much of a distinction beyond that,' Biden said on Meet the Press.

The president signaled that he was open to changing his opinion on gay marriage in 2010 when he said his feelings on the issues were 'evolving.' 

'I struggle with this,' he famously said.

Since 2004, Obama has opposed gay marriage, saying his beliefs were based on his Christian faith.

As a presidential candidate he supported civil unions.

However, this isn't the first time Obama has changed in mind on the issue.

In
1996, as an Illinois State Senate candidate, he told a gay newspaper in
Chicago that he was in favor of legalizing same-sex marriage and 'would
fight efforts to prohibit such marriages.'
