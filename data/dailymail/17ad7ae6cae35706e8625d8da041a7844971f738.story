Adam Peaty produced a storming last 25 metres to land the Commonwealth 100m breaststroke title on a night of double Glasgow gold for England at the Tollcross Swimming Centre.

The 19-year-old reeled in South Africa's Cameron van der Burgh in the closing stages to touch in a Games record of 58.94 seconds, with home favourite Ross Murdoch taking the bronze.

And Peaty admitted afterwards that he was amazed to beat the Olympic champion whose performances he has idolised during his development.

'I can't believe it, it's a dream,' he said. 'I've studied Cameron van der Burgh for a while, he was my idol now my rival so I know he goes off quick but I caught him.'

Peaty's gold followed success for Fran Halsall in the 50m freestyle and took England's gold medal tally in the pool to four.
