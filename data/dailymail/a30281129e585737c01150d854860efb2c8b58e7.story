We reveal how to get the enviable physiques of the stars. 

This week: Cindy Crawford’s arms.

It’s hard to believe that decades have passed since model Cindy Crawford, now 49, first appeared on the covers of glossy magazines, as she recently showed off super-sculpted arms with no hint of bingo wing. Crawford is a fan of running and hiking, as well as Pilates and dance classes.

Essential to her toned appearance is a twice-weekly weights routine designed ‘to hit the major muscle groups: legs, bum, abs, back, chest, triceps, biceps and shoulders’, she says.

What to try: The single arm row is a good way to tone upper arms. You will need a bench or dining chair and a dumb-bell or bottle of water.

Stand sideways to the bench with left side nearest to it and place your left knee and left hand on the seat.

Keep your back straight and body ‘square’ to the floor. Holding the weight in your right hand, allow it to hang at arm’s length so that it is in line with the shoulder.

Then pull the weight up, keeping elbow close to the body, until it is level with your back. Lower the weight to the start position and repeat 12-15 times before changing sides.
