Rape charges have been filed in Las Vegas against former NFL safety Darren Sharper, who already faces sexual assault charges in Los Angeles, New Orleans and the Phoenix area.

Sharper's Las Vegas attorney, David Chesnoff, appeared Friday before a Las Vegas judge on two sexual assault charges stemming from allegations that he forced sex on two women in January 2014 while they were incapable of resisting. 

Details of the Las Vegas allegations weren't immediately available.

Chesnoff declined to comment on the charges but said Justice of the Peace Janiece Marshall set another court hearing for April 3. Each count carries a possible sentence of 10 years to life in Nevada state prison. 

Sharper, 39, is sought on a warrant in Las Vegas, but he has been jailed since Feb. 27 in Los Angeles, where he was due for a preliminary hearing Friday after pleading not guilty to drugging and raping two women in 2013.

He faces rape allegations in New Orleans, where he's accused of sexually assaulting three women in 2013.

He has also been indicted in Arizona on charges he drugged three women and sexually assaulted two of them in November 2013 in the Phoenix suburb of Tempe. 

Sharper is also under investigation in Florida for sexual assault.

Exact details of the Las Vegas case have not yet been made public, but they are likely similar to the other three cases in which after a night out he would allegedly take a woman or women home who later reported they believed he served them a drink mixed with an illicit substance.

He would then engage in sexual intercourse with the woman or women. 

Sharper retired in 2010 after a 14-year All-Pro career as a defensive safety with the Green Bay Packers, Minnesota Vikings and New Orleans Saints.
