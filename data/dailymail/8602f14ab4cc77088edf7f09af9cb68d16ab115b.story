Federal agents have raided the Massachusetts pharmacy linked to the widespread meningitis outbreak across America that has left 16 people dead and left more than 200 ill with the infection. 

Agents from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration searched the New England Compounding Center (NECC) in the Boston suburb of Framingham, with officers from the local police department providing support.

Nearly 14,000 people nationwide are at 
risk of infection because they received injections from suspect steroid 
medications shipped to 76 facilities in 23 states.

Raided: The Food and Drug Administration searched the New England Compounding Center (NECC) in Framingham after at least fifty vials of steroids containing fungi linked to meningitis were discovered

Caution: The grounds of the pharmaceutical company's headquarters were cordoned off as the agents raided the property

Outbreak: The NECC's products have been linked with the deadly meningitis outbreak across America which has left 16 dead

The raid took place as calls came for
an even wider probe into whether the pharmacy may have broken federal 
laws dealing with controlled substances, as additional meningitis cases 
were announced in the country.

Carmen Ortiz, U.S. attorney for Massachusetts, said in a statement: ‘I can confirm that this office and our law enforcement partners are investigating allegations concerning the New England Compounding Center.’

Ortiz said it was ‘entirely premature’ to speculate about what might be uncovered.

Paul Cirel, a lawyer representing NECC, said the raid was unnecessary and that ‘asking would have produced the same result.’

He added: ‘It is difficult to understand the purpose of this search, since we have been clear that (NECC) would provide, and has provided, anything requested. 

‘We've been clear that warrants weren't needed.’

The entrance to NECC's headquarters was cordoned off with yellow tape as the agents searched the property into the night.

The FDA's criminal unit, the Office of Criminal Investigations, is a team of agents with specialised knowledge and training to investigate violations of food and drug laws. It pursues about 1,200 criminal cases each year.

Long haul: Agents and local police search the premises well into the night

Lethal: The raid was undertaken as the outbreak widens, with 231 confirmed cases across the country

The raid came as a leading U.S. lawmaker called for an investigation of whether the compounding pharmacy violated federal laws covering potentially addictive drugs.

Meanwhile, the U.S. meningitis outbreak is widening. A 16th fatality was announced on Tuesday, after the death of a patient from south west Virginia.

According to statistics released yesterday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there are 231 confirmed cases of meningitis in America, 19 more cases than the previous figures revealed.

Experts believe the outbreak will get worse before it gets better.

Dr William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, said: ‘We will see more patients reporting in ill and we'll have to treat many more.’ 

The FDA on Monday widened its investigation of the cause of the fungal meningitis outbreak to other drugs made by NECC.

Product: Pictured are the vials of the injectable steroid used to treat back pain made by New England Compounding Center implicated in the fungal meningitis outbreak

Last week the FDA said that more than 50 vials of steroid treatments from NECC tested positive for a fungus that causes meningitis.

Infections have been detected within two weeks of a patient receiving the NECC-supplied medication methylprednisolone acetate, on average, and up to 42 days afterward.

But anyone exposed to the vials of 
the steroid  - used to treat back pain and other conditions - should be 
vigilant for health problems for several months, CDC officials said. 
Local health authorities have contacted over 90 percent of patients who 
may have been exposed.

Although
it remains unclear exactly how any medication could have been 
contaminated, federal regulators have come under criticism for failing 
to prevent the outbreak by closely regulating drug compounding companies
such as NECC, which prepare medications for clinics and doctors largely
outside federal oversight.

The FDA has said the law does not give it adequate authority to do so, leaving regulation largely to the states.

The pharmacies are owned by Gregory Conigliaro, an engineer, and his brother-in-law Barry Cadden, a pharmacist who was in charge of pharmacy operations at NECC.

'It does seem like the agencies, both at the state and the federal level, may have been misled by some of the information we were given,' Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick said last Wednesday.

Hopeful: CDC workers at the Infectious Disease Laboratory hope that the raid of the NECC can help to control the widespread outbreak

Besides the meningitis cases, two additional patients have a different type of fungal infection from injections in their joints (as opposed to back injections).

Massachusetts Democratic Representative Edward Markey, a senior member of the committee that oversees business, called on the Justice Department to investigate whether NECC violated federal laws designed to stem illegal activity in controlled drugs.

The company already faces multiple investigations by the FDA and several states, but Mr Markey's request could launch an even more serious probe involving the Drug Enforcement Administration, which oversees sales of potentially addictive or controlled drugs.

The FDA said on Monday it was looking into two other drugs produced by NECC.

The agency said it had received reports of a patient with possible meningitis who received an injection of a different steroid from the one found to have caused the deaths.

It said on Tuesday that one transplant patient was infected with a fungus after receiving a drug used in open heart surgery manufactured by NECC. The FDA originally said two such patients were infected.

Investigation: Shawn Lockhart and his colleagues at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are working round the clock to ascertain exactly how the outbreak of fungal meningitis began

Confirmed: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have said they have found Exserohilum, a type of fungi, in patients with meningitis

Another patient identified by the FDA received an injection of the steroid triamcinolone, also supplied by NECC.

On Tuesday, FDA official Janet Woodcock stressed that the two additional products had not been linked to confirmed infections.

She asked doctors to contact patients injected since May to make sure they had no signs of infection.

NECC said in a statement that it was reviewing the new information from the FDA.

The FDA has been inspecting the NECC facilities. Woodcock said that based on the condition of the plant and other factors, 'we really can't assure the sterility of these products.'

The legal threat to NECC also mounted as more victims of meningitis filed lawsuits, including two filed by Michigan residents this week.

All but eight of the 23 states that received suspect medications from the Massachusetts specialist pharmacy have reported at least one case of fungal meningitis.

Meningitis is an infection of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms include headache, fever and nausea. Fungal meningitis is not contagious.

The outbreak has raised questions about how the pharmaceuticals industry operates as a whole in the U.S.

NECC engaged in a practice called drug compounding that is not regulated by the FDA, which generally oversees drug manufacturers.

Tragic: Lilian Cary, 67, from Michigan died of meningitis in September, weeks after being treated with steroids for back pain

Grieving: Lilian's husband, George, received similar treatment at the same clinic where his wife was treated but said there was 'no evidence' he had contracted meningitis

In compounding, pharmacies prepare specific doses of approved medications, based on guidance from a doctor, to meet an individual patient's need.

A Reuters investigation found that NECC solicited bulk orders from physicians and failed to require proof of individual patient prescriptions as required under state regulations.

State pharmacy regulators have said that NECC violated its license in Massachusetts by not requiring patient prescriptions before shipping products.

The states reporting cases of meningitis are Tennessee, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, New Jersey, Texas, Idaho, Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia, Ohio and Florida.

Lilian Cary, 67, from Howell, Michigan, is one of the victims of the infection.

Ms Cary's husband, George, received pain-killing injections at the same Brighton-area clinic where his wife was treated shortly before her death.

The grieving husband was forced to have a spinal tap to check to see whether he had been infected, but said there was 'no evidence' that was the case.
