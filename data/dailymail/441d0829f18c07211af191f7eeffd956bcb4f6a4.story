This is the moment Andy Murray's father got down on one knee to propose to his long-term girlfriend, just a month after the tennis ace popped the question to his long-term love Kim Sears.

Will Murray, 60, is set to tie the knot with his girlfriend of more than 10 years, Sam Watson, after proposing during a festive walk along a beach on Christmas Eve.

The couple, who met when Andy moved to Barcelona to train more than a decade ago, celebrated their engagement with the 27-year-old tennis star and his brother Jamie at their home in Dunblane, Perthshire.

The engagement comes just a month after the Wimbledon champion proposed to his own girlfriend of nine years. He popped the question with a diamond ring he chose himself in November, and Kim – who he met at the U.S. Open in 2005 – said yes.

No details have emerged about either  wedding, but relatives have been quick to congratulate the most recent engagement news.

Sam's daughter, Brogan Watson, 20, wrote on Twitter: 'Congratulations to my mum and will on their engagement!!'

And her other daughter, Erin Watson, said: 'Congratulations to my mum and Will on their engagement so happy for the 2 of them (sic).'

It is believed Sam's daughter Brogan helped Will buy the engagement ring, which he presented to his long-term girlfriend while down on one knee during the beach walk.

A source close to the couple told the Daily Express: 'Will and Sam have been a couple for a long time now and he just felt the time was right.

'He wanted to do something special for Christmas this year and the proposal on the beach was very romantic. He was a bit nervous beforehand.

Will was said to be 'a bit nervous' before he got down on one knee to pop the question on Christmas Eve

Sam's daughters took to Twitter to congratulate the couple and post pictures from the engagement (above)

Brogan Watson, 20, wished her mother and Will congratulations on her Twitter page following the proposal

'All the family are delighted and it was a double celebration with Andy and Kim also recently getting engaged.'

The source added that the family haven't made any plans for a double wedding, but quipped: 'You never know.'

Will, an area manager for Scottish newsagent chain RS McColl, split with Andy and Jamie's mother Judy nearly 20 years ago.

The couple's tennis star sons continued to live with him in Dunblane after the divorce was finalised, and he put his love life on hold while he helped bring them up.

He later met Sam, an optician, when Andy moved to Spain to study at the Schiller International School and to train on the clay courts of the Sanchez-Casal Academy.

Speaking in 2009, Will said: 'Once we got to a point where the boys were more comfortable with the situation between me and their mother, then I built up a bit of a social life again.

'I sold the house in Dunblane when Andy went to train in Spain about seven years ago and moved into an apartment in town.

'Just about that time I met Sam and we've been together ever since.'

Andy, 27, announced in November that he had proposed to long-term love Kim Sears, 26 (together above)

The couple tend to remain out of the limelight, but both have been seen strongly supporting their sons at matches and both have cheered on Andy at Wimbledon.

Will has watched without envy as his ex-wife – a former tennis pro herself – has become almost as well-known as their sporting sons.

He said previously: 'Since Andy and Jamie have been in the public eye for the past couple of years, Judy has always been there with them. That's just the way it's worked out and I am not the kind who runs in and demands publicity.

'To me, it's just about Andy and Jamie. They are the people that count and as long as they are happy, that's all that matters.'
