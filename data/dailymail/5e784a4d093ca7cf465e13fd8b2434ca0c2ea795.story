She was the Afghan child bride whose horrific injuries at the hands of her husband shocked the world.

Today, most of Sahar Gul’s terrible wounds have healed, her hair and nails have grown back, and she has ambitions to be a doctor or a lawyer.

But as three people were jailed for ten years each for their part in her torture, the 15-year-old broke her public silence to demand a harsher sentence.

She described how her life had been destroyed by her husband – who is still on the run – and his family and said that she would never have peace until she had left Afghanistan.

'Ten years is not enough, they should be given 50 years,' Sahar said. 'They should be punished in prison.

Sahar Gul has made a remarkable recovery since she was rescued after neighbours heard her tortured cries

When her abusers electrocuted her feet, Sahar though she was going to die

'They hurt my eyes and pulled out my nails and hair and the same should 
be done to them. Whatever they did to me, the same should be done to 
them.

'I think the punishment given by the 
court to these people worries me. The government is trying its best to 
find my husband; convicted but on the run.

'But if tomorrow, if he finds me, it's possible he could kill me.'

When she was first pictured in her hospital bed she appeared small and withdrawn. But now she appears to have put on more weight and the scars that were left on her body have all but disappeared.

During the court case against her husband and his family, it was said that the beatings at a
house in northern Baghlan province started because Sahar had refused to
become a prostitute.

She believes that the 10-year prison sentences weren't long enough and wants to see them treated the same way as they treated her

Sahar was forced to marry at the age of 15 and raped by her husband, but because she didn't become pregnant they started torturing her with the intention of eventually making her become a prostitute

It was only when neighbours heard her pained cries
that authorities were alerted to what was going on.

'[My husbands family] told me to go to the basement because there are some guests coming to the house,' she told CNN.

'When I went there the came in and tied my hands and feet and pulled me upwards from above. They brought very little food for me, while going to the bathroom they used to beet me a lot. I was crying all the time.

'When they put electric shocks in my feet I felt like I was going to die at that moment. I screamed and that was how our neighbours realised there was something happening.

'For one day and night I was unconscious, feeling dead.'

While Sahar has clearly made a remarkable physical recovery, the mental scars will no doubt last for years. She wants to escape from Afghanistan, but remains hopeful for her future.

'I want to go abroad,' she said. 'If I stay here they will find me. I want to go to school and become a doctor or a persecutor so I can give punishment by myself to these people.'

Cruel: Sahar Gul was brutally tortured by her husband's family. The 15-year-old was burned with cigarettes and had chunks of her flesh cut out with pliers

Disgusting: Sahar Gul's in-laws pulled out her nails and hair, and locked her in a dark basement bathroom for about five months, with barely enough food and water to survive

Her husband's family also burned the teenager with cigarettes and cut out chunks of her flesh with pliers.

Following the ordeal, Afghanistan president Hamid Karzai said those responsible would be punished and despite being barely able to speak, Miss Gul managed to tell media about the terrifying ordeal.

'For several months I was locked up in a toilet by my in-laws and 
particularly my mother-in-law,' she said. 'I was denied food and water. I was tortured and beaten.'

Doctors say the youngster has suffered both mentally and physically and will need weeks of treatment in order to recover.

'She was married seven months ago, and was originally from Badakhshan province. Her in-laws tried to force her into prostitution to earn money,' Rahima Zarifi, head of women's affairs in Baghlan told Reuters.

Miss Gul was covered in scars and bruises, with one eye still swollen shut six days after her rescue.

'This is one of the worst cases of violence against Afghan women. The perpetrators must be punished so others learn a lesson,' health minister Suraya Dalil told journalists after visiting Sahar.

Recovery: Sahar Gul was treated in a government hospital in Kabul, but doctors have said she may have to be sent to India

Despite progress in women's rights and freedom since the fall of the Taliban 10 years ago, women throughout the country are still at risk of abduction, rape, forced marriage and being traded as commodity.

However it can be hard for women to escape violent situations at home, because of huge social and sometimes legal pressure to stay in marriages.

Running away from an abusive husband or a forced marriage are considered 'moral crimes,' for which women are currently imprisoned in Afghanistan.

Some rape victims have also been imprisoned, because sex outside marriage, even when the woman is forced, is considered adultery, another 'moral crime.'
