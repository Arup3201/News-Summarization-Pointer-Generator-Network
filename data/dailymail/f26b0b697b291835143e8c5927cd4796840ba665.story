A man locked in a battle with his energy supplier has gone without gas or electricity for three years because he refuses to pay for his meter to be fixed.

Chris Guest, 50, has refused to pay Eon £70 to fix the device, which they installed in 2010, and has been left without power ever since.

Mr Guest has been forced to read by torchlight, go without heating and hot water, and survives on corned beef sandwiches because he is unable to cook.

The former advert writer, who cannot work because he has gout, has also resorted to using his mother's washing machine and charging his phone at other people's houses.

After three years living in miserable conditions, he has finally decided to speak out having reached the end of his tether.

He said: 'I can't cook, I have a mobile phone I charge at other people's houses just so I can listen to the radio and at night it's pitch black.

'My mum didn't even know. She's 84 and I didn't want her to worry.'

Mr Guest fell out with Eon over a bill in 2010. To resolve the problem, the firm entered his house while he was out and installed a prepayment meter using legal powers granted by the Warrant of Entry Act.

Mr Guest claims they reached a stalemate around Christmas 2010, after he finally paid off an outstanding £500 bill.

He claims he then found that the meter was not working and Eon wanted another £70 to repair it, which he refused to pay.

Eon decline to comment on the dispute, but confirmed that Mr Guest has not used any electricity for three years.

The company says they have tried to resolve the issue with.

A spokesman said: 'With regard to Mr Guest's case, a prepayment meter was installed in May 2010 due to a considerable balance which had built up on the account.

'His last payment was made in 2005 for £1.97 and Mr Guest has been provided with a prepayment key to use to top up his electricity meter with credit.

'We have tried many times since then to resolve this matter, however energy used needs to be energy that is paid for.'

Mr Guest's landlord, Green Vale Homes, 
confirmed that he was unable to use his boiler without an electricity 
supply and has urged him to come to an agreement with Eon.

Frances Clarke, head of Green Vale Homes, which is responsible for maintaining Mr Guest's boiler said: 'We are aware Mr Guest has had a dispute with his energy suppliers.

'We would urge him to resolve these disputes as soon as possible so we can carry out a full check on his heating system.

'The boiler won't work without an electricity supply and an inactive system is more prone to leaks, especially in cold weather as the pipes expand and contract, so we hope we can avoid this.
