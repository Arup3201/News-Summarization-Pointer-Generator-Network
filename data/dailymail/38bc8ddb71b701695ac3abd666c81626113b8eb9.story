Hamburg midfielder Lewis Holtby is facing a long spell on the sidelines after breaking his collarbone in a friendly encounter on Thursday.

The 24-year-old, on loan from Premier League side Tottenham, has been ruled out for around 10 weeks after falling awkwardly on his shoulder during his side's 3-0 win over Eintracht Frankfurt in Dubai.

He will undergo surgery on Friday before continuing his long recovery, which rules him out of some crucial fixtures in Hamburg's battle to avoid relegation from the Bundesliga.

'It's obviously very bitter for Lewis,' said Hamburg coach Josef Zinnbauer on his club's website.

'I'm incredibly sorry for him. We will support him in any way we can.'

Holtby had been on the field only 10 minutes when he fell badly on his shoulder after clashing with Frankfurt's Martin Lanig.

He spent the night with his shoulder immobilised in hospital and he will remain in hospital for several days after the operation.
