A man charged with killing a woman and raping her 10-year-old daughter after a carjacking at a New York mall last week was able to remove his court-ordered electronic monitoring bracelet before carrying out the brutal attacks.

A senior probation officer told a New York court earlier this week that David Renz, 29, managed to cut the device from his ankle and put it back together so quickly that it didn't prompt BI, the company in Colorado that makes the monitors, to notify court officers in Syracuse.

Now an expert in offender tracking technologies has spoken out to say the blame in this case lies not with the tracking device, but with the protocols of the pretrial unit assigned to monitor Renz.

Expert George Drake denies that the GPS device could have been at fault in the case of David Renz, right, who has been charged with first-degree rape, murder and kidnapping, as well as second-degree murder

‘As soon as the ankle bracelet comes off
the ankle, it creates an event. But the pretrial services in Syracuse 
decided, for some reason, to not make it an alert unless an event 
persisted for some period of time,’ said George Drake, president of corrections technology firm Correct Tech.

‘There was a hole in the security fence and someone found it and walked right through it,’ Drake told ABCNews. ‘They should close that hole.’

In the federal court system, 51,170 defendants have been supervised on pretrial relief in the past 12 months, with nearly 9,000 defendants placed on electronic monitoring.

Drake said in the vast majority of those cases a GPS bracelet is a perfectly acceptable means of monitoring suspects but it had been a bad choice in the case of Renz.

According to Chief U.S. Probation Officer Matt Brown, officers had told BI not to notify them when the ankle monitor's signal was interrupted for a short period of time because the officers had been getting tampering alerts every time the devices were knocked against bathtubs or walls.

‘We finally figured out that the circuit can be interrupted because of something as simple and innocent as that,’ Brown told Syracuse.com.

Since the incident BI has admitted to Brown that this isn’t the first time someone had tampered with one of its monitors this way.

The company’s contract is being reviewed by the U.S. Office of Probation and Pretrial Services in Washington as a result of this incident.

A tracking device similar to the one Renz removed from this ankle on Thursday evening before he allegedly killed a school librarian and raped a 10-year-old girl

Probation officers
didn’t know Renz had slipped their leash until more than two hours 
after state police say he attacked school librarian Lori Bresnahan and 
her daughter outside Great Northern Mall, tied up Bresnahan, raped the 
girl, stabbed Bresnahan in her car and fled on foot as the girl ran 
away.

When
Renz was arrested shortly after police said he killed Bresnahan, he was
not wearing the ankle monitor, which he had left at his home to prevent
it from sounding an alarm.

There
was no alert to probation officers from BI until 11:30 p.m. That only 
occurred because the monitor hadn’t moved in more than four hours. At 
12:30 Friday morning, state police alerted Brown that Renz had been 
arrested.

In 2003, BI, also known as 'Behavioral Interventions,'
was found to be partly responsible for the death of a Texas woman who 
was killed by an ex-boyfriend who snipped off his ankle bracelet. BI 
paid the woman’s family $200,000, according to news reports.

Renz was beaten and suffered a broken nose during his first night in jail, authorities said.

When he appeared in federal court on Friday to face a probation violation charge, he had a swollen face and tissues stuffed up both nostrils.

His attorneys, James Greenwald and Kenneth Moynihan, said Renz was assaulted by other inmates at the Onondaga County Justice Center, where he was taken following his arrest.

Sheriff Kevin Walsh said he was looking into why Renz was put into a holding area with other prisoners - not the usual practice in holding someone facing such accusations.

Walsh said Renz has been segregated from other prisoners and is being watched around the clock.

'We're dealing with a man who is innocent until proven guilty,' he said. 'He's got to be protected.'

Renz
was arraigned Friday morning at a court in East Syracuse on charges 
that he abducted the mother and daughter as they left a gymnastics class
in the Syracuse suburb of Clay.

Police said Renz raped the girl and stabbed the mother to death before fleeing into some woods. The 10-year-old girl escaped and was found by a passing motorist, who dialed 911.

Renz was captured a short time later.

He had abducted the school librarian 
and her daughter as they left a gymnastics class at a mall in the 
Syracuse suburb of Clay, about 150 miles west of Albany, on Thursday 
night.

Renz bound both victims, raped the girl and 
drove a short distance to a spot where the girl escaped and was found by
a passing motorist, troopers said.

The motorist told 911 dispatchers he saw a 
man running away from the scene, allowing police to quickly send in 
officers on the ground and a sheriff's helicopter in the air. Renz was 
caught a short time later near a wooded area.

They believe
Renz tied up the woman and the girl and then raped the 10-year-old in a
deserted area of the mall parking lot shortly before 9pm on March 14.

It was unclear how the girl escaped or when her mother was killed, authorities said.

Police
are still piecing together the timeline of the crime, but their best 
guess is that after assaulting the girl, Renz drove down a nearby rural 
road.

That’s where they think the woman, 47, who worked at an elementary school, was stabbed to death.

The
girl managed to escape the scene and run down the road and was aided by
a passing driver. The child's name has not been released.

The girl sustained injuries from the attack and is currently being treated at a hospital. Her mother died from multiple stab wounds.

Police seem sure, however, that the suspect did not know the victims personally.

Following his court appearance, the 29-year-old suspect was returned to jail, but placed into protective custody. Renz is also being guarded for now, but he will not be transferred to a different facility.

The 29-year-old had been charged in 
January with possession of child pornography and allowed to remain free 
under terms that included staying off the internet and away from places 
including schools, parks and arcades.

He lost his job at a supermarket, 
moved in with his mother and hadn't been able to find other work after 
his arrest, according to court documents.

According
to an FBI criminal complaint, agents who went to the North Syracuse 
apartment where Renz was living in June found in his bedroom four 
computers that he told them he used to view adult pornography.

Agent
Alix Skelton said Renz eventually admitted using the internet for the 
past six years to download child porn to a drive on one of the machines,
which he turned over to the agents. Technicians determined in November 
that it had an encrypted hard drive, and Skelton said Renz provided the 
encryption key.

Agents 
reviewing the drive in December found about 100 gigabytes of child porn 
comprising more than 500 videos and more than 3,000 images, according to
the complaint.

Among the 
images were two showing sex acts involving prepubescent girls, said 
Skelton, a member of a unit that targets people involved in online 
exploitation of children.

Renz was charged on January 9 in federal court with possession of child pornography. On Jan. 29, a judge granted a prosecutor's request for an extension of the time required for grand jury action so investigators could continue going over 'numerous items of electric media' for additional evidence.

Renz, who authorities said had no prior police record, was released after agreeing to stay at home at night with an electronic monitor and away from any place he might encounter children.

Late Friday afternoon, state police turned Renz over to federal authorities, who will hold him for violating the terms of his release, court documents said.

Duncan said the cases against him will continue in federal and state courts.

In an interview with Syracuse.com on Friday, a former manager and trainer of David Renz described him as a courteous and intelligent employee who had worked at the James Street Wegmans since his teens.

The manager recalled that the 29-year-old was always willing to help customers and was 'trusted' by his superiors.
