Brad Barritt's England return was scuppered after the Saracens centre had to be taken off with a serious-looking knee injury during a win over Wasps.

Barritt, who was expected to replace Luther Burrell at 12 for England against Scotland next week, landed awkwardly after contesting a high ball with Wasps' Andy Goode.

And it was reported that the 28-year-old may have suffered knee ligament damage, which would rule him out of the Six Nations, after he was treated off the pitch before limping off.

It is a blow to Stuart Lancaster, who had hoped to bring Barritt back into the team for the Calcutta Cup clash.

Northampton flanker Tom Wood, an England team-mate of Barritts, tweeted his support, writing: 'Really hope that wasn't as bad as it looked mate. Hopefully see u tomoro'. 

Saracens held on, despite losing Barritt, to win 26-17, becoming the first team to win at the Ricoh Arena in the Premiership since Wasps moved there.

Sarries scored two tries through Jackson Wray and Chris Wyles with Alex Goode converting both and adding four penalties.

The big centre had been in line for a return to the England squad, but the injury looks likely to rule him out
