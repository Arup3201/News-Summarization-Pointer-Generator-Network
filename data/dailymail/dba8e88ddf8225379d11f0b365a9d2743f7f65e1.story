Elderly actors who played Munchkins in The Wizard of Oz have told of their shock at the campaign to propel Ding Dong! The Witch is Dead to the top of the charts in the wake of Baroness Thatcher's death.

Ruth Duccini, 94, and Jerry Maren, 91, who sang the song as part of the classic family film's cast of munchkins, said it was 'terrible' that the song had been hijacked by critics of the former prime minister, who died at the Ritz on Monday.

'Nobody deserves to be treated in such a way... I am ashamed I really am,' Ms Duccini said.

Campaign: The song Ding Dong! The Witch is Dead from the iconic family film is climbing the charts in the wake of Baroness Thatcher's death

'When we were filming the movie no one intended it to be used in this way,' she told the Sun from her home in the U.S, adding that the campaign made her 'very sad'.

Mr Maren, who also appeared in the Judy Garland film, agreed, adding: 'It is shocking that the song is being used to celebrate the death of someone.' He described Baroness Thatcher as a 'great lady'.

The pair spoke out after the BBC was accused of fudging the decision over whether to play the track during the chart show on Radio 1 this weekend.

The song is climbing the charts after critics of the former Conservative prime minister launched an online campaign to get it to the number one spot as a means of 'celebrating' her death.

Allies of Lady Thatcher have branded the
 campaign 'utterly disrespectful', and have urged the BBC not to play 
the song. But the corporation has confirmed it will play a 'brief 
excerpt' of the track during the chart show following hours of private 
talks.

The song, which at number 10 in the BBC's singles chart on Wednesday, is at the number one spot in the UK chart on iTunes.

The BBC has said its Radio 1 chart show will contain a news item explaining why the song is in the charts, during which a short clip of the track will be played.

The new director general Tony Hall released a statement in which he said he personally viewed the campaign as 'distasteful and inappropriate'.

But he added that to ban the song outright would be wrong as 'free speech is an important principle'.

Tory MPs have branded the decision to play a clip of the song as a 'cop out' by Lord Hall and BBC executives.

Meanwhile admirers of Baroness Thatcher have launched a counter-campaign to get punk band the Notsensibles' 1979 track I'm In Love With Margaret Thatcher back into the pop charts.
