Paul Scholes has confirmed he will not be taking over as Oldham Athletic manager.

As revealed by Sportsmail, the League One side wanted to make the Manchester United legend Lee Johnson's replacement but Scholes did not feel the timing was right.

And the 40-year-old, who lives in the town, confirmed the decision in his column in the Independent on Friday.

Paul Scholes is a lifelong Oldham Athletic fan but feels the timing is not right for the manager's job

Scholes says there is no way he would ever combine a coaching job with his work on television

He said he was tempted by the offer and believes he will one day manage Oldham but added: 'I just did not feel this was the right time.

'When I go into management, I want to do so with 100 per cent commitment. At the moment I have a lot of responsibilities and things going on in my life that I cannot simply drop immediately. Most importantly I have a young family who need their dad around, having been away a lot during my playing career.

'There was no way, for example, I would ever have tried to combine a coaching job with my work on television.'

Scholes, who only played for Manchester United, has not ruled out being Oldham boss in the future

Lee Johnson left League One side Oldham Athletic to become manager of Barnsley

Former Oldham boss Iain Dowie is the fans' favourite for the job and is expected to meet chairman Simon Corney this weekend although whether the club can give him assurances over the availability of funds to strengthen the squad is unclear.

Others linked with the post include ex-Chelsea defender Winston Bogarde, former Oldham striker Shefki Kuqi and Huddersfield Town coach Steve Eyre.

Oldham, who go to Yeovil Town on Saturday, are three points outside the play-offs with a game in hand on many of their rivals.

Coach Dean Holden is currently in charge, assisted by experienced defender Adam Lockwood.
