Bolton are in talks over a deal for Celtic midfielder Kris Commons.

Manager Neil Lennon, who is also hoping to secure a loan deal for Manchester United midfielder Nick Powell, wants Commons, 31, to spearhead his side’s promotion push.

Commons is out of contract in the summer and will weigh up his options as he is on the periphery at Celtic under Ronny Deila after being a regular under Lennon.

Bolton may struggle to match Commons’ wages but could offer bonuses if he can help them go up. They are 11 points off sixth-placed Brentford at this stage.

Starting his career with Stoke City, Commons has also played for Nottingham Forest and Derby County. 

Celtic, meanwhile, were among clubs represented at Tranmere's clash with Northampton on Sunday as they continue to monitor midfielder Max Power. The 21-year-old is out of contract in the summer.
