This is the heart-stopping moment a photographer came within inches of a young cheetah when it stuck its head through her sun roof.

Australian Bobby-Jo Clow, 31, was on safari in Tanzania when the juvenile started heading towards her Land Rover with his sibling.

She carried on taking pictures as the young male dangled its paws in front of her face and smelt her hair before its mother called it away into the wilds of the Serengeti National Park.

But not until Ms Clow, a full-time elephant keeper at a Tanzanian Zoo, had leaned forward enough to capture the perfect shot, causing the cheetah to hiss and bare its teeth.

She said: 'It was wildlife heaven. It was so overwhelming. I was actually crying through my viewfinder at times.

'I wasn't scared, I was in total awe of how majestic and glorious this young cheetah was.

'He ducked down and peered through the windscreen, like he was trying to see who else was in the car.

'My hands were shaking so much with excitement that I was very surprised that my shots were in focus.

'It made me feel extremely happy.'
