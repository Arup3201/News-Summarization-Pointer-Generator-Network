A video of a horrifying assault on a young woman by a female attacker has spread across the Internet.

In a smartphone clip, uploaded to Instagram on Tuesday, a girl called Sharkeisha is seen viciously sucker-punching a girl called Shay in the face before kicking her in the head as she lies curled up on the ground.

Sharkeisha then has to be restrained by another young woman as her victim lies on the ground, protecting her head with her hands.

A girl, called Sharkeisha on the tape posted online on Tuesday, sucker-punches her victim as she sends her flying to the ground

The attacker then screams obscenities at her victim who lies on the ground holding her head. It appears that the confrontation followed a dispute over a boyfriend.

The identity of Sharkeisha has not yet been confirmed however several Twitter and Facebook users have identified the attacker as 22-year-old Sharkeisha Tyeshia Thompson from North Carolina.

This young woman, also known as Shakeisha, has a number of prior convictions and mugshots listed with the Sheriff's Office in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina.

The video went viral after it was posted on Instagram but was later removed by the social media site. It was later uploaded by worldstarhiphop.com where the number of 'likes' jumped by thousands in a matter of minutes.

The brutal assault has spawned a number of spoof videos and memes, many based on the movie Sharknado and its similarity to the attacker's name - however it is unlikely that authorities will take such a light-hearted view of the vicious assault.Â
