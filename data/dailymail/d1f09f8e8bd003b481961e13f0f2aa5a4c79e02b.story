Two teenage girls have died in a horror crash after the sports car they were in smashed into a wall.

The 19-year-old friends were passengers in a Mazda RX-8 being driven by a 21-year-old man when it hit the wall in Lyndhurst, Hampshire, this morning.

Emergency services were called to the picturesque New Forest village at around midnight after residents heard a loud bang like an 'explosion'.

Nicky Marshall, landlady of the Stag Hotel, said Lily had been in the pub last night with Abbey.

She said: 'She was here last night - they were getting a lift home.

'We are all devastated, absolutely devastated. Everybody knew her. 'She was here all the time, she was a full-time nanny and worked here in the evening.

'She was a lovely girl, full of energy. It is awful. We were meant to be wearing fancy dress today but I don't think we will be doing that now.

'She was always helping me out. She was a good girl, full of life, but she was also sensible.

'I could trust her to look after the pub. She was everything you would want in a daughter. I can't believe she's gone.

'She was going to be wearing a reindeer outfit today for Christmas.

'Abbey was a lovely girl and they were really good friends. We let her go early so they could continue the evening with her friends.'

This afternoon Miss Godwin's boyfriend, Kane Parnell, took to social media to express his grief. 

'Absolutely gutted and broken into pieces! Just wanna say thank you to everyone for your thoughts and love! ' he wrote.

Her friend Abbey worked as a stylist at a The Velvet Rooms Hair & Beauty salon in Lyndhurst.

The salon is closed today as a mark of respect and to let staff come to terms with her death.

The sports car collided with the wall where the road forks left toward nearby Brockenhurst, and right towards Christchurch in Dorset

A message on the salon's Facebook page said: 'As you all know the velvet rooms has a fallen angel. One of our beloved team was taken from us. We are devastated. 

'She was an amazing girl and loved soooo much (sic). Please give us time to grieve. We apologise for any convenience.

'The Velvet Rooms will be closed until further notice due to bereavement.

'We have tried to contact all our clients with appointments. When we reopen we will rebook.'

Meanwhile, friends and colleagues of the two teenage girls have been paying tribute.

One of the notes at the scene reads: 'To Lilz, I love that you used to make belly full of butterflies.

'I will miss you everyday. You made every smile on my face in our time together. I love you so much. I will miss our "Sundays".'

Friends of Abbey have been posting tributes on her Facebook page.

Lillia Neale wrote: 'RIP Abbey, heaven has another angel now.'

Kerri Brannigan said: 'R.I.P to my beautiful friend you are gunna be missed so much love you baby girl xxx.'

Richard Collis said: 'Rest in peace Abbey you'll never be forgotten.'

Neighbours in the quiet New Forest village described the crash as being 'like a small explosion' and ran from their homes to offer help.

John Gibbs, 49, said: 'It was an almighty bang. It was obviously one car, it didn't sound like two cars hitting each other.

'It was like a small explosion, that was what it sounded like.

'They blocked the road off. We didn't go up to bed until 3am, there was no traffic until then.'

Mr Gibbs described how local residents went to help victims of the crash and how neighbours brought out sheets to cover one woman to keep her warm.

He added: 'I went out and somebody was calling for help. I thought it was round the corner as you couldn't see a thing - it was pitch black.

'The car was facing the wrong way, it was not looking in good condition.'

Mark Thompson, who also lives nearby, added: 'It was like thunder.

'It must have had quite an impact - I can only imagine what it was like. It is tragic.'

The crash happened in Gosport Lane, part of the A35 which runs one way round the back of Lyndhurst high street.

The sports car collided with the wall where the road forks left toward nearby Brockenhurst, and right towards Christchurch in Dorset.

A total of 18 firefighters from across Hampshire attended the scene in an attempt to free the group of four.

They worked together to cut the driver and three young women from the car. Two ambulances and a response team were sent to the scene.

Hampshire Constabulary are appealing for witnesses to help establish the circumstances of the crash.

A police spokeswoman said: 'Police are investigating a road traffic collision in Lyndhurst after two young women died.

'Four people were travelling in the car: the driver, a 21-year-old man, and three passengers, all 19-year-old women.

'Two of the passengers were pronounced dead at the scene.'
