An Olympic runner who lived a double life as a $600-an-hour call girl in Las Vegas is planning a new memoir about her exploits on and off the track.

Suzy Favor Hamilton, 46, competed for the United States in the 1992, 1996 and 2000 Olympic Games - but was living a double life offering herself up as an escort under the pseudonym Kelly Lundy.

Hamilton was unmasked in 2012, and lost a host of lucrative athletic sponsorship deals with the likes of Nike and Disney.

While working for the Haley Heston Private Collection company Favor Hamilton, a married mom, had tried to conceal her true identity.

She had blurred her faces in the provocative photographs published online, and wrote in her profile that 'discretion is EXTREMELY important to me', later adding that obscuring her identity was 'essential'.

Her rates were $600 for one hour, $1,000 for two, $4,000 for 12 and $6,000 for 24 hours. Her profile listed her as being 110lbs and 5' 4", and made much of her blonde hair and blue eyes.

Now, however, discretion could hardly be further from her mind after her book deal with Dey Street Books, an imprint of HaperCollins, came to light.

The 320-page book, titled Fast Girl: Running from Madness, is set to hit stores in June next year.

However, both she and her publishers have been silent about what exactly the book will cover - and retail listings only have the title, author, price and publisher listed.

Speaking to The Smoking Gun when her sideline was revealed, Favor Hamilton, said: 'I'm owning up to what I did. I would not blame anybody except myself... Everybody in this world makes mistakes. I made a huge mistake. Huge.'

In a series of Twitter posts after her escort work was disclosed, Favor Hamilton said that the paid encounters provided 'coping mechanisms' and 'escape' from a life in which she struggled with depression.

Favor Hamilton, now a certified yoga instructor, recently relaunched her web site, noting that, 'I'm not about to hide in shame. I'm here, perfectly willing to remain in the public eye.'

She is now a yoga instructor, who divides her time between Los Angeles and Madison, Wisconsin.

Her new website, which makes no direct mention of her escort girl past, says: 'Sure, this site is designed to provide exposure for me and keep people up to date on what I have going on, but more than anything I hope it serves as a statement that I’m not about to hide in shame.

'I’m here, perfectly willing to remain in the public eye.'
