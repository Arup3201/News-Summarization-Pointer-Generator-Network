Teens are in danger of doing long-term damage to their spines by leaning over screens for up to four hours

It's unlikely computer addicted teenagers will take any notice â€“ although desperate parents might be grateful for this ammunition. 

Four in ten teens have suffered back or neck pain from spending too much time slouched in front of the TV or a computer screen, according to researchers.

A study by the British Chiropractic Association revealed that more than one in seven parents said their son or daughterâ€™s problem was a result of using a laptop, tablet or computer.

The survey of more than 460 parents of 11- to 16-year-olds also found that 23 per cent of teens are spending between two and four hours a day watching TV, while a quarter spend the same amount of time on a laptop, tablet or computer.

Based on a two hour period, young people spend more time on games consoles (33 per cent) than doing an activity such as riding a bicycle (12 per cent).

When asked how much time their teenager spends on their bicycle, more than one in five parents (21 per cent) admitted that their child doesn't even have a bike.

Nearly half of the parents polled (46 per cent) acknowledged that their children don't spend enough time exercising, despite NHS guidelines stating that children and young people between five and 18-years-old need to do at least one hour of physical activity every day.

Now the BCA is encouraging parents to limit the time their children spend using technology.

Commenting on the study to mark Chiropractic Awareness Week, BCA chiropractor Rishi Loatey, said: 'We are seeing more and more people under the age of 16 with back and neck pain and technology is so often the cause.

The British Chiropractic Association told parents of 11-16-year-olds their children spend more time on laptops than doing physical exercise such as riding a bike or running

'Young people are becoming increasingly sedentary which is damaging their posture.

'There is the tendency to sit in a hunched position when working on computers and laptops, putting a lot of strain on the neck.

'Learning how to sit properly and keeping active will help to keep young people healthy and pain free.

'It's important that parents seek help for their children from an expert as soon as any pain starts - if conditions are left untreated it could lead to chronic back and neck problems in later life.'
