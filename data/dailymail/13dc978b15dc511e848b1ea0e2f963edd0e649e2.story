The jewellery of a former Playboy model who called Australia home is set to go under the hammer in a bid to raise funds for charity.

Uta Pearson became a well-regarded collector of antiques and jewellery in South Australia after reaching the height of fame when she appeared as a Playboy centrefold in 1974.

The German-born model, internationally famous for her 'Bond girl' looks, continued to buy the pieces and left behind an exquisite collection after her death last year, aged 74. 

Uta Pearson spent most of her life living in South Australia. She was a Playboy model and glamorous jetsetter who left behind an incredible collection of jewellery when she died late last year

Her exquisite jewels are being auctioned and the proceeds will be donated to charity to assist wildlife

As a passionate traveller, the stunning blonde bought and traded antiques and jewels during her many journeys around the world.

Having lived in both New York and London, Uta settled in Australia in 1966 where she remained for 47 years. 

Due to her fun-loving, outspoken character, and her passion for fashion, she appeared on local television and wrote numerous articles for newspapers and magazines.

She was often photographed in social pages and was very proud of her appearance in Playboy magazine.

Amongst the pieces up for grabs are antique diamond butterfly brooches and a beautiful butterfuly made from a stunning blue stone

Her style has been described as boho-chic and her collection of jewellery contains many sought-after pieces

Uta was always concerned about wildlife conservation. She raised funds for this cause during her lifetime.

Her final wishes were that her assets be liquidated and the proceeds donated to the animal conservation society of her choice. 

Ironically, many of the incredible pieces are also in the shapes of animals.  

Caring Uta's final wish has now been granted - auctioning of her jewellery, and other assets, to raise funds for charity. 

Amongst those benefiting from the sale by Bonhams will be the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust based in Jersey - where Uta had been a member since the 1970s.

Uta was a socialite, model and television personality who as born in Germany and travelled the world before she settled in Australia, where she lived for 47 years

The collection of jewellery, which includes 85 pieces, will go under the hammer on November 25, in Sydney, Australia.

Amongst the pieces up for grabs are antique diamond butterfly brooches and spider and snake bracelets.

Lucky bidders could also take home Nouveau diamond encrusted bats, and rings modelled as coloured diamond animals.

Long-time friend and the executor of the model's will, Vaughan Cottle, said that the donation was not out of character.

He said: 'She was quite the character, and not afraid to coerce her friends into donating, as she'd often leave herself short to make sure that animals in Gerald Durrell's care were provided for.'

Uta's final wishes were that her assets be liquidated and the proceeds donated to the animal conservation society of her choice. She chose the Durrell Wildlife Park in Jersey

Rachel Shaw, head of fundraising at Durrell, said: 'We are very grateful to Uta for her support during her lifetime, and with this final gift in her Will.

'She has also given us a wonderful opportunity to offer people the chance to own some beautiful pieces of jewellery, and at the same time help us in our mission of saving species from extinction.' 

The proceeds will we used by Durrell to continue to work towards financial stability.

The charity's conservationists are currently poised to launch the most all-embracing mission in the trust's 51 year history - a global effort to save amphibians.

A spokesperson for Bonhams added: 'It was Uta's wish that these jewels, which brought her much enjoyment over her life, be offered at auction and that the proceeds of their sale be donated to the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust.' 

The antique jewellery from Uta's collection will be auctioned off as part of Bonhams Fine Jewellery auction on November 25 in Moore Park, Sydney
