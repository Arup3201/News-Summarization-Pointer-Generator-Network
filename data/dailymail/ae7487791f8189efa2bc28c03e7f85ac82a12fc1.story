Chinese parents have admitted to putting their son in chains and refusing to let him go as a punishment for constant stealing.

Father Wen Yuan, 47, chained up his son, Chuang, 24, because he believed his thieving habits had brought shame on the family.

As a result he tied his son to his bedroom in their house in Xibianban village in south China's Jiangxi province, for fear that if he didn't stop his son from stealing, he would soon end up in jail.

Chuang was chained by the neck to a heavy concrete block, which he placed in the boy's bedroom so that he couldn't do anything but move around the room and sit in his bed.

Wen Yuan said: 'It isn't exactly a large community here, when something is stolen 
everybody knows who's to blame.

'I always had to compensate my neighbours
 and apologise for what he had stolen if I couldn't return it and I just
 got fed up with it.

'I can't keep paying compensation all the time 
because I just can't afford it and eventually someone was can call the 
police and he would have been locked up.

Chuang Wen Yuan had been stealing things around the neighbourhood to the point that his parents could no longer keep bailing him out

Chuang's parents tied him by the neck to a concrete block that his father found, so that he could not leave his room

'I don't think once you been
 jailed would be any chance of correcting him and so we have kept him at
 home and chained him up to remind him exactly what a wonderful thing is
 to have freedom.'

He said that every time the youngster had stolen something he had given him repeating warnings.

But he explained that nothing had helped over the years.

His parents claim the did not have the money to keep bailing their son out of his scrapes, it appeared that there would be no end to the thievery, so they turned to a unique brand of parenting

His parents intend to keep him chained up until they are convinced he has 'learned his lesson'

So Chuang's parents felt they only had one option: a prolonged stay in chains.

Wen Yuan added: 'I don't know how long they will people like that, we need to be convinced he's learned his lesson and is prepared to become a proper part of the community.'
