'Absurd': Education Secretary Michael Gove, pictured at No10 yesterday, wants the clause removed

Teachers could be stripped of the ‘absurd’ right to refuse to do basic work-related tasks such as photocopying and stapling.

Contracts currently contain a clause that states they cannot be ordered to carry out day-to-day duties that millions of other workers do as part of their job.

Michael Gove today spelled out his intention to end the practice by referring it to the independent School Teachers’ Review Body, which looks at pay and conditions.

In a letter to chairman Dame Patricia Hodgson he wrote there is ‘a need to review the framework for non-pay conditions’ that will give schools the ‘flexibilities they need to deliver outstanding education provision’.

The ban on 21 routine administrative and clerical tasks was introduced in 2003, when support staff took over the duties.

The list included collecting money for school trips, stapling reports together, investigating a pupil’s absence, keeping records and putting up displays in classrooms.

They were also exempted from analysing exam results or pupils’ reports - both essential to identify weaknesses.

It was approved by most unions except the National Union of Teachers, which argued classroom assistants would be expected to do more if workloads were reduced - meaning more lessons taken by people not qualified as teachers.

The STRB has been asked to send its recommendations to Mr Gove by January next year.

These could include removing the clause from the teachers’ employment contract. Those that continued to refuse to do the tasks would be in breach of contract.

The Education Secretary’s letter will further inflame relations with teachers’ unions

The NUT and NASUWT, which represent 90 per cent of teachers between them, have already announced a series of strikes later this year over pay, pensions and conditions.

Earlier this week the Department for 
Education unveiled guidelines on how to appraise performance related 
pay, which is being introduced from September. They included taking 
pupils’ performance and behaviour into account.

Unions are also opposed to fundamental reforms to the National Curriculum and exam formats.

A government source said some of the items on the list of prohibited tasks were ‘absurd’.

They added: ‘Teachers shouldn’t be forbidden from analysing why their pupils might be struggling and all teachers who want to improve the reputation of the profession should support sensible reform.

‘Decisions on these issues and things like how best to prepare classes are much better made by teachers on the ground, heads of department and headteachers - not by politicians and union leaders.’

A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘The STRB has said that there needs to be a consistent national framework for the profession.

‘It is now appropriate for the STRB to consider the full range of those aspects of the School Teachers Pay and Conditions Document.’

But NASUWT general secretary Chris Keates said: ‘The letter shows the depth of contempt the Secretary of State has for the teaching profession, for schools, and for children and young people.

‘He is determined to remove any provisions which support teachers in working effectively to raise standards.’
