Holland manager Louis van Gaal has thanked David Moyes for the form of Robin van Persie and revealed he has been set a target of reaching the World Cup semi-finals by the Dutch FA.

Van Persie has scored in friendlies against Ghana and Ecuador and Van Gaal admitted Moyes - who he succeeded as Manchester United manager this summer - helped get the striker fit ahead of Holland's opening game against champions Spain on June 13.

The 30-year-old striker had been struggling with knee and thigh injuries after a frustrating season with United, but Moyes's decision to allow him to travel back to Holland for a fitness camp seems to have paid off - much to the relief of Van Gaal.

'He (Van Persie) is coming out of injury, you know that. We built him already up in our federation, our medical department,' Van Gaal told The Daily Mirror.

'It was under the permission of David Moyes. So we could control him. He has worked very hard. Then he played two matches of 20 or 30 minutes and the last match 30 minutes.'

Despite the rapid improvement in Van Persie's condition, Van Gaal admitted the striker has some way to go but he is confident he will be fully fit to face Spain.

He added: 'Van Persie had a heavy injury. So I think of course he is not 100 per cent fit. He is not 100 per cent fit. But he can play. We have two weeks to go (before the Spain game). But I think he will be 100%.'

Van Gaal also admitted he is under pressure to reach the semi-finals of the World Cup.

Four years ago in South Africa, Holland lost in extra time to Spain but Van Gaal has suggested that reaching the semi-finals this time around may be beyond his squad. He said: 'The purpose of the board is the semi-finals. I think itâ€™s a big purpose. The purpose is maybe too big an expectation.'
