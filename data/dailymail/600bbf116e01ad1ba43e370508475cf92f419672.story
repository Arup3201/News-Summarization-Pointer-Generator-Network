Paying extra money for private school fees does not guarantee a better paying job out of university, new research has shown.

The study has found there is no long-term employment advantages for private school students, with public school graduates earning just as much in equally prominent jobs.

A Canberra University research fellow, Jenny Chesters, found that even though private school students were more likely to attend prestigious Australian universities, it would not lead to a higher income.

A Canberra University research fellow, Jenny Chesters, found that even though private school students were more likely to attend prestigious Australian universities, it would not lead to a higher income

'If a parent wants to pay to send their child to a private school, I don't have a problem with that but they should know that if they think paying for an education is an investment and you will get a monetary return on it, you probably won't,' Dr Chesters told the Sydney Morning Herald.

The basis of the study analysed data from the Melbourne Institute's Househould Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia report.Â 

Dr Chesters examined data for more than 2,000 people aged between 24 to 35 in 2012.

About 70 percent went to public schools, while 17 percent attended Catholic schools and 13.5 percent to independent schools.

While the students more likely to have graduated from high school in year 12 attended Catholic or independent schools, public school students were not disadvantaged when it came to getting a high paying job out of university.

'There has been an explosion in independent schools since (former Prime Minister) John Howard changed the funding formula so, if you are aged 25 to 34, an independent school is a very different place than it was if you are 45,' Dr Chester said.
