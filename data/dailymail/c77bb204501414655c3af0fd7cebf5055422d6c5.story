A restaurant owner and ex-cop was caught off guard when a brazen burglar entered his steakhouse and walked out with a 250-pound safe.

Kevin Hynes owns Stockholders Steakhouse in South Weymouth, Massachusetts where the burglary happened last Sunday, during the busy dinner hours.

'It was almost like a perfect storm, he had some kind of information, I'm thinking from the inside or someone that knew what was going on here at the time,' co-owner Erik Hynes told Fox 25.

Brazen: A burglar was caught on camera entering Stockholders steakhouse in Weymouth, Massachusetts Sunday night and making off with the restaurant's safe

Inside source: During the six minute heist, the burglar remained on his cellphone leading the restaurant's owners to believe that he was getting information and it was an inside job

Right under their noses: The burglar conceals the 250-pound safe in a garbage bag and walks out of the restaurant without notice

Surveillance footage shows a man wearing a hat and tan jacket enter the restaurant through a side door before going down the stairs and into the storage room, all while on the phone.

'That tells me it was one of the employees, an inside job,' Kevin Hynes told CBS Boston. 'Or it was one of the delivery guys.'

At one point the burglar passes a manager on the floor, who gives him a second look, but moves on without raising suspicion because people come in and out of the restaurant all day.

From there, the burglar forces his way into the office where he picks up the 250 pound safe and walks right out of the restaurant without attracting notice, using a trash bag to conceal his loot.

Caught off guard: Stockholders is co-owned by former policeman Kevin Hynes who says he's never heard of such a brazen burglary

Won't happen again: The Hynes family will be stepping up security at all three of their restaurants. They replaced the safe with a new 315-pound one that has been bolted to the floor

'This guy was a big guy. He knew it was a one man job, he knew his size, he could pull it off and he did' Erik Hynes said.

They wouldn't say how much cash was in the safe when it was stolen, but Kevin Hynes said 'it was enough to hurt'.

Weymouth police continue to investigate the burglary and the restaurant is offering a $2500 reward of their own for any information to lead them to the thief.

Since the burglary, The Hynes' have purchased a heavier 315-pound safe for the restaurant, which has been bolted to the floor.

They said they will be stepping up security at all three of their restaurants.
