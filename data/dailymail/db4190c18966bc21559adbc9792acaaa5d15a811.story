A biker has been filmed performing a series of death-defying tricks inside a hollowed-out mansion on 'Billionaire's Row' in Kensington.

Chris Northover rode his dirt bike into the former Russian embassy on Kensington Palace Gardens - reputed to be the most expensive street in Britain - which is now owned by the founder of Foxtons estate agent.

Once inside the Grade II-listed building, which is currently undergoing a total renovation, he carried out stunts such as doughnuts, wheelies and jumps before going up to the roof.

Imposing: Mansion is thought to be worth around £100 million despite needing total renovation

Stunt: Rider used his Oset trials bike to perform doughnuts, wheelies and other tricks throughout the building

Beams: Stunts included balancing over wooden beams where the floorboards had been removed

He sped towards the edge of the roof at high speed, repeatedly braking just in time to stop inches short of a 50ft drop.

The
 27 year-old, who works for a biking magazine, also jumped onto the 
window ledges, hopping from one to another in a fearless display.

But 
perhaps the most daunting move of all was abseiling through a skylight 
while still on his Oset 20.0 48v trials bike, worth around £1,800.

Basement: At one point in the video the rider is seen zipping through arches underneath the house

Balance: Later Northover appears on the roof of the mansion and balances on the apex with his leg ajar

On the edge: He also bounces across the tops of small bay windows

'It was a really good experience,' said Mr Northover, from Welwyn Garden City in Hertfordshire. 'All that was going through my head when I got up there was don't fall off, as I could be really badly hurt or die.

'But once I started it was like riding on a pavement. I've done a few stunts before but the abseiling bit was was terrifying.

'It was all quite surreal as we were on the roof and people were down on the ground looking up.'The bike was brilliant. They market them as children's bikes but it's really strong and I've had loads of fun with it.'

Jump: The daredevil could be seen jumping between windows from the ground without any ropes or safety net

Long way down: Northover considers a shortcut down from the roof through a skylight

Swing: He uses a lanyard to swing through safely into the room below

The house used to be the Russian embassy, but in 2005 it was bought by entrepreneur Jon Hunt for £14million.

Mr
 Hunt, who founded Foxtons in 1981 and sold it for £390million in 2001, 
gave Mr Northover permission to film his stunts in the house last 
summer.

He is currently carrying out a major programme of renovation on the property, which is now estimated to be worth around £100million.

Among the features of the home when it is finally finished are set to be an underground tennis court, health centre and a private motor museum for Mr Hunt's six vintage Ferraris.

Steady: Northover used careful control of his brakes to ensure he didn't slip over the edge

Relief: He removes his helmet at the end of the video

The owner is known as a lover of 
motorsports - he hosts classic car exhibitions and motorcycle stunt 
shows at Heveningham Hall, his country estate in Suffolk.

Mr
 Northover's video, entitled 'Storm the Embassy', has been viewed more 
than 320,000 times since it was first posted on YouTube.

'When the video got to 20,000 views we went out and celebrated as we didn't expect it - but it has kept going,' he said.
