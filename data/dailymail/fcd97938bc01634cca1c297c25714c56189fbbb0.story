Known as America’s first serial killer, his innermost thoughts have remained secret for the last 63 years.

But now Howard Unruh’s reasons for killing 13 people in 1949 have finally been made public - including his chillingly clinical confession.

Speaking to a prosecutor about how he began his ‘walk of death’, Unruh calmly said: ‘I went over to the shoemaker, pulled the gun and I shot him.’

Deposed: Howard Unruh, war veteran who went berserk and shot and killed 13 men, women, and children, is questioned on September 7, 1949 in a Camden, New Jersey, hospital by prosecutor Mitchell B. Cohen

The tranche of files suggests he was paranoid, convinced his neighbours were out to get him and severely damaged due to an incestuous relationship with his mother.

Void: In his confession, Unruh was clinical in the way he described the massacre

And on the day of the massacre, his failure to meet up with a gay lover and discovering his home had been damaged could have been the things to send him over the edge.

Unruh took just 20 minutes to enter America’s criminal history books when on September 6th 1949, the lithe 6ft-tall man wearing a bow tie shot 13 people and injured three during a rampage through Camden, New Jersey.

He used a 9mm German Luger pistol – commonly used by soldiers in WWII - he had purchased two years ago at a Philadelphia shop for the killings, taking aim first at shoemaker John Pilarchik, 27.

Aged 28 at the time and an unemployed World War II veteran, he has been described as the first instance in the US of a ‘lone wolf’ gunman going a killing spree.

His methodology has been copied many times since.

Unruh handed himself in and was convicted, spending more than six decades in jail before dying in 2009 at the age of 88 after a lengthy illness.

An investigation by the Philadelphia Inquirer has now unearthed documents about his prosecution and treatment by psychiatrists for the first time, giving a new insight into his motives.

Taken down: Unruh was arrested some 20 minutes after he began shooting people

An hour after giving himself up Unruh was sat in the Camden Police Detective Bureau talking to County Prosecutor Mitchell Cohen whom he told: ‘I deserve everything I get, so I will tell you everything I did and I will tell you the truth’

'Neither of
us said nothing, and I pulled the trigger. He had a funny look on his 
face, staggered back and fell to the floor.I then realised he was still 
alive, so I fired into his head.'

-Howard Unruh

The Inquirer reported that Unruh was interrogated by psychiatrists who used a truth serum to try and discover his motives, a technique which is discredited now but at the time was considered effective.

He told them a month after the attacks: ‘I had levelled the gun at (the shoemaker’s), neither of us said nothing, and I pulled the trigger.

'He had a funny look on his face, staggered back and fell to the floor.

‘I then realised he was still alive, so I fired into his head.’

Early years: Uhruh, as seen in his yearbook photo for Cramer Junior High, (left) was described as 'a very quiet fellow'; he also served abroad in WWII

They found that two years before the killings he had decided to ‘become’ gay but was paranoid his neighbours knew his secret.

The
night before the massacre began he had been due to meet a man at a 
theatre frequented by homosexuals but did not make it due to traffic.

John Wilson, 9, shot in car

Emma Matlack, 68, shot in car

One of the reports from the narcosynthesis session reads: ‘He was very much broken up about that.‘This is the one point in the whole narco when he showed any emotion.’

Unruh
spent several hours brooding at the theatre and went home, only to 
discover that the rear gate had been damaged, possibly by a storm.

In the early hours of the morning he made up his mind to kill, but waited until 9.30am so the shops were open and his targets would be where he wanted them.

Among the other revelations are the details about Unruh’s mother, with whom he lived after his father left their home.

In one of his sessions with psychiatrists, Unruh talks about fondling her breasts and mentions how ‘their privates touched’.

The report by Dr Robert Bennett says: ‘He never remembers being sexually excited.

‘He showed no emotion whatsoever throughout the entire narco until he started talking about this incident with his mother, being in bed with her, wrestling, etc.’

Unruh also admitted that he had been considering killing his mother, but she fled the morning of the massacre after he threatened to kill her and did not return home.
