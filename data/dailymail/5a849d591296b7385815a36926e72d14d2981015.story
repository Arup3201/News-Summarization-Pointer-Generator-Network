The biggest strike for five years will cause huge disruption to schools, courts and travel tomorrow in the most serious industrial challenge to the coalition since it was formed.

Hundreds of thousands of teachers, lecturers, civil servants and other workers will walk out for 24 hours in protest at controversial plans to change their pensions, cut jobs and freeze pay.

All police leave in the capital has been cancelled as the force seeks to control a huge protest march as well as walkouts by civilian staff at Scotland Yard.

The strike will cause delays to people arriving at airports. Managers have been trained to step in to conduct airport passport checks amid staff shortages (file picture)

The co-ordinated union action is also set to hit up to 15,000 schools, affecting seven million children

Extra officers are being parachuted 
in to man 999 call centres with fears that a minority of activists may 
attempt to hijack the march for their own purposes.

The first effects of the strike 
action will be felt tonight, before the official time of 12.01, with 
staff at the Border Agency set to walkout early due to varying shift 
patterns. 

That will cause huge problems for passengers at 
Gatwick and Heathrow airports, which are warning passengers 
of long delays at passport control.

'As far as we are concerned the 
strike officially starts at 12.01 but the effects of it may be felt 
earlier,' said a Border Agency spokesman.

Tomorrow, Westminster Bridge will be 
closed, as will the roads around the Palace of Westminster, with police 
fearing 'Greek-style' protest outside Parliament. Security inside 
Parliament is also going to be stepped up.

Mark Serwotka, leader of the Public 
and Commercial Services union, said it was the most important strike in 
his union's history, adding: 'Everything we have ever worked for is 
under attack.'

Schools: Up to 15,000 will close

Airports and seaports: Severe delays expected

Courts: Urgent cases will be heard but trials may be postponed

Job centres: Jobseekers Allowance will be paid automatically with no signing on

Universities: 350 colleges and 75 universities to close or partially shut

Whitehall: Skeleton staff

Driving tests: Licenses and tax discs should be applied for online

Coastguard: Expected to continue as usual

Fire service: No strike but most staff are against increasing retirement from 55 to 61.

The Prime Minister launched a fresh 
attack on the strike, while business leaders warned it will have a 
'significant impact' on industry.

David Cameron told MPs there was no 
case for industrial action and repeated that the proposed changes to 
public sector pensions were 'fair'.

Speaking at Prime Minister's question
 time, he said he hoped 'as many mums and dads as possible' would be 
able to take their children to school despite the action.

'I don't believe there is any case for industrial action tomorrow, not least because talks are still ongoing.

'It is only a minority of unions who have taken the decision to go ahead and strike.

'What we are proposing is fair. It is
 fair to taxpayers but it is also fair to the public sector because we 
want to continue strong public sector pensions.'

He also attacked Labour leader Ed 
Miliband, who did not ask about the walkout, accusing him of being 'in 
the pocket of the unions'.

The British Chambers of Commerce said
 disruption will lead to many parents having to take the day off work to
 look after their children, losing them pay and hitting productivity.

Paul Griffin of law firm DBS Paul 
Griffin warned that workers could face disciplinary action if they take 
time off to look after their children.

Mr Cameron today echoed his feeling that the strikes were wrong at a time when negotiations were ongoing

He said: 'Anyone thinking of phoning 
into the office tomorrow and claiming absence on the grounds of a 
parental emergency could find themselves in hot water.

'Whilst parents are entitled to 
unpaid time off to arrange childcare due to sickness or some other such 
unpredictable event, these strikes have been known about for months.

'Employers could argue that this 
situation does not qualify as an emergency and take disciplinary action 
against individuals who don't turn up for work.'

Picket lines will be mounted outside 
school gates, courts, jobcentres, Parliament, driving test centres and 
Government buildings by members of the National Union of Teachers (NUT),
 Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL), University and College 
Union, and PCS.

Negotiators: Len McCluskey of the Unite union and Mark Serwotka of PCS who warned of a security risk

Education Secretary Michael Gove has said that teachers wanting to strike could be forced to tell head teachers if they intend to strike.

Many schools will close - up to 15,000 - because they don't know if they will have enough staff to provide adequate supervision.

Schools are not allowed to close 'in sympathy' with strike action, but may be forced to as a result of the staff shortages.

Mr Gove told the Commons that these rules would be reviewed as he urged schools to stay open with CRB checked parent volunteers.

He said: 'I would far rather see schools stay open and offer a restricted curriculum than see hard-working families have to lose a day's pay themselves or have to pay for ad hoc and expensive last-minute childcare.'

He added that it was 'regrettable' that two of the teaching unions were planning strike action which was 'unnecessary while talks were still going on'.

'It will cause massive inconvenience to hard-working families and it will hit working women particularly hard,' he said.

Mr Gove has also written to head teachers asking them to keep schools open warning that strikes 'won't improve the prestige of the profession' an a column for The Sun today.

He concluded: 'This Government won't allow strike action to derail our drive for a better future for our children.'

Labour leader Ed Miliband said: 'I understand why teachers are so angry with the Government.

'But I urge them to think about whether causing disruption in the classroom will help people understand their arguments.'

Business Secretary Vince Cable said 
he believed the public would find it difficult to understand why the 
strike was going ahead when negotiations over pensions were continuing.

It was 'imperative' that public 
sector pensions were reformed, said Dr Cable, adding that he intended to
 be in his office tomorrow and hoped that if any Business Department 
staff went on strike it would not 'spoil' the working relationship.

Mike Cherry, policy chairman of the 
Federation of Small Businesses, said: 'Small firms are concerned about 
the impact that the proposed strike action will have on their ability to
 do business on Thursday.

'The recovery remains in a fragile 
state and this action will have a wider impact on the economy as 
businesses lose productivity - something the economy simply cannot 
afford.'

Airports have warned travellers to expect disruption on arrival into the UK as immigration and customs officers join the strike.

Passengers have been advised to consider travelling on a different day to avoid delays as hundreds of staff walk out.

A spokeswoman for Virgin Atlantic 
said: 'Virgin Atlantic is working closely with the UK Border Agency to 
support their contingency planning and minimise disruption to our 
customers.

'We will keep our passengers informed of the situation through text messages, advice at check-in and onboard announcements.'

High-speed Channel Tunnel train company Eurostar said it would not be affected by industrial action.

It added that it was running two 
extra trains tomorrow - one from London to Paris, the other from Paris 
to London, to cope with expected extra demand.

Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, has written to headteachers across the capital urging them to keep their schools open.

'To close would cause considerable 
inconvenience to working parents who will be forced to make alternative 
childcare arrangements,' said the Evening Standard, quoting from his 
letter.  

Disappointed: Francis Maude, left, and Danny Alexander said the talks 
were 'constructive' but said they were unhappy the strike was going 
ahead

A militant union is ‘bullying’ 100,000 school support staff into joining teachers in Thursday’s mass walkout – even though they have not voted to strike.  

Education Secretary Michael Gove has implored schools to remain open by any means possible, utilising an army of mothers and support staff.

But yesterday it emerged the GMB – which is not involved in this round of strikes – is telling its members not to cross the picket line.

The GMB represents some 100,000 non-teaching schools staff, from teaching assistants to dinner ladies, and caretakers to porters.

It is illegal union members, other than those who have voted in favour of action, to strike.

However, under guidelines from the Department for Business, non-striking staff are not obliged to cross a picket line.

Meanwhile Unison, which represents 200,000 school support staff, has told its members not to cover the jobs of striking teachers.

Their action will make it near-impossible for the majority of schools to remain open.

'It would also have a considerable 
impact on those employers in the capital whose employees will need to 
take leave to care for their children.'

NUT leader Christine Blower said: 
'The action tomorrow is regrettable but unfortunately, due to the 
position that the Government has taken, unavoidable.

'Teachers have been left with no 
option but to demonstrate the strength of feeling they have about the 
unnecessary proposals, which will see teachers paying more, working 
longer and getting less for their pensions.

'The National Audit Office has confirmed that teachers' pensions are affordable.

'The Institute of Fiscal Studies has said all the evidence demonstrates that the costs of public sector pensions are falling.

'It is increasingly obvious that the Government is pressing ahead with changes on an ideological, not economic, argument.'

Mr Serwotka urged union members to 
ignore Government calls not to strike, adding: 'Thousands of jobs are at
 stake, lower pensions are set to cost three times as much, and pay is 
frozen while inflation soars.

'If you have never taken part in strike action before, make tomorrow's national action your first.'
