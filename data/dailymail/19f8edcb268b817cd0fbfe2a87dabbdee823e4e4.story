'Despicable': Michael Coyle was caught trying to sell a World War One memorial plaque to a scrap dealer

A convicted burglar will spend Christmas in jail after being caught trying to sell a stolen First World War memorial plaque to a scrap dealer for just £200.

Jobless Michael Coyle, 40, was captured on CCTV trying to get rid of the 5ft by 3ft bronze memorial.

When the dealer realised the significance of the plaque, which was inscribed with the names of 34 men who died in the Great War, he confronted Coyle, who claimed an ‘old guy’ had given it to him and he didn’t know what it was.

Magistrates were told that police were called and arrested Coyle two days later based on the CCTV footage.

But he refused to name his accomplice and the plaque, which had been 
taken from the grounds of Christ Church, Willaston, Wirral, in July has 
never been recovered. 

Coyle, of Little Neston, Wirral, was jailed for nine weeks by 
Chester magistrates after admitting handling stolen goods.

Michael Trevor-Barnston, chairman of the bench, told Coyle: ‘This was a 
particularly despicable offence and we found it hard to believe that you
did not know what you had in your possession.

The plaque, taken from the grounds of Christ Church, Willaston, Wirral, in July has never been recovered. Coyle was jailed for nine weeks after admitting handling stolen goods

'You have previous 
convictions for dishonesty and you failed to help police recover the 
plaque, causing shock and abhorrence to the families and loved ones.’ 

The memorial was built in 1921, with the £1,130 cost being met from 
public subscription. It contained the names of many locally raised men 
who fell on the battlefields of the Western Front.

Others were killed in
more distant campaigns, such as Mesopotamia and Palestine, or died in 
captivity in Germany. After the Second World War, the names of nine men 
killed during that conflict were inscribed on another plaque.

Relatives of those honoured on the memorial last night said Coyle was a ‘disgrace’.

Upset: Reverend Raymond Dent of Christ Church, standing next to the memorial which is without its two plaques

Alan Pollard, 89, who served with the Gloucester Regiment during the 
Second World War, said: ‘It is a disgusting crime and one that left 
people truly appalled and I welcome the magistrates’ decision to jail 
this man.’

Mr Pollard, who is related to Private John Pollard, a soldier with the 
Cheshire Regiment who died in Mesopotamia aged 23 in 1917, said: ‘I 
really don’t understand what goes through the minds of someone to steal 
such a thing. He is a disgrace.’

The Rev Ray Dent, the vicar of Christ Church, said the memorial will 
cost between £8,000 and £10,000 to restore. ‘It is a terrible crime,’ he
said. ‘Some of the village have called for the stocks, but my concern 
is that he (Coyle) won’t help the police find the plaque, so he can’t be
truly repentant.

‘He will be meeting another judge one day and needs to clear his conscience. I will be praying for him.’

Sue Gibson, prosecuting, told the court that both plaques were reported 
missing on July 30. Schoolchildren made replacements so the monument 
could be used for last month’s Remembrance  parade.

Neither bronze has been recovered but within 48 hours of the theft, 
Coyle was caught on CCTV driving into a local yard and offering a plaque
as scrap. He would have received just £183.30 for the metal.

Coyle lives on incapacity benefit after being diagnosed with depression.
Chris Hunt, defending, said his client had ‘genuine remorse’.

Highlighting a Facebook campaign  against Coyle, he added: ‘What you do 
to him is a fraction of the punishment he will receive in a campaign of 
vilification against him.’

Anyone wishing to make a donation to help replace the memorial can 
send a cheque, payable to the Willaston War Memorial Fund, to The 
Vicarage, 13 Hooton Road, Willaston, Neston, South Wirral, CH64 1SE.
