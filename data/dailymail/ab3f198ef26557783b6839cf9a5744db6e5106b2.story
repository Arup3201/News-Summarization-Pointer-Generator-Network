A mineral discovered on Mars could suggest there may have been past life on the red planet.

Scientists have discovered that the earliest living organisms on Earth were capable of creating this mineral, which may hint that similar microbes were able to do the same on Mars.

Named stevensite, the clay mineral has been used since ancient times by Nubian women in Egypt as a beauty treatment.

But up until now, scientists had believed deposits of the mineral could only be formed in harsh conditions like volcanic lava and hot alkali lakes.

Researchers led by Dr Bob Burne from the Australian National University (ANU) in Canberra have now found living microbes create an environment that allows stevensite to form, raising new questions about the stevensite found on Mars.

‘It's much more likely that the stevensite on Mars is made geologically, from volcanic activity,’ Dr Burne said.

The latest study found that microbes can become encrusted by stevensite to create ‘microbialites’.

Microbialites are the earliest large-scale evidence of life on Earth

‘But our finding – that stevensite can form around biological organisms – will encourage re-interpretation of these Martian deposits and their possible links to life on that planet.’

Dr Burne and his colleagues found microbes can become encrusted by stevensite, which protects their delicate insides and provides the rigidity to allow them to build reef-like structures called ‘microbialites’.

‘Microbialites are the earliest large-scale evidence of life on Earth,’ Dr Burne said.

‘They demonstrate how microscopic organisms are able to join together to build enormous structures that sometimes rivalled the size of today's coral reefs.’

He said the process still happens today in some isolated places like Shark Bay and Lake Clifton in Western Australia.

‘Stevensite is usually assumed to require highly alkaline conditions to form, such as volcanic soda lakes. But our stevensite microbialites grow in a lake less salty than seawater and with near-neutral pH,’ he added.

The discovery of microbes once living on Mars is key to understanding whether life once flourished on the red planet.

In a separate study, researchers have shown that some of the simplest and oldest organisms on our planet could also survive on the Martian surface.

Named methanogens, these organisms use hydrogen and carbon dioxide to metabolise and produce methane.

Methanogens live in swamps and marshes, but can also be found in the gut of cattle and termites, as well as in dead and decaying animals.

These ancient and highly-specialised ‘extremophiles’ are thought to be able to grow quickly in harsh conditions.

They are anaerobic, so they don't require oxygen. They also don't require organic which suggests they could exist in sub-surface environments.

Researchers from the University of Arkansas wanted to see if two species of methanogens could withstand Martian freeze-thaw cycles below the organisms’ ideal growth temperatures.

Methanothermobacter wolfeii was placed in a chamber 55°C (131°F) and Methanobacterium formicicum in one at 37°C (98.6°F).

The two species were selected because one is a hyperthermophile, meaning it thrives under extremely hot temperatures, and the other is a thermophile, which thrives under warm temperatures.

‘The surface temperature on Mars varies widely, often ranging between -90°C and 27°C over one Martian day,’ said Rebecca Mickol, a doctoral student at the University of Arkansas.

‘If any life were to exist on Mars right now, it would at least have to survive that temperature range.

‘The survival of these two methanogen species exposed to long-term freeze/thaw cycles suggests methanogens could potentially inhabit the subsurface of Mars.’
