Mitt Romney has 
raised more than $5million since the Supreme Court upheld President 
Barack Obama’s signature healthcare reform, a sign that the ruling could
energise Republicans this November.

In a message to supporters on Friday 
morning, just over 24 hours after Chief Justice John Roberts had 
delivered his majority opinion, the Romney campaign said it had raked in
$5.5million from 55,000 supporters.

The campaign also touted Mr Romney's 
social media presence, which they said underlined the fact that 
Americans were mobilising against the Affordable Care Act – better known
as Obamacare – by backing the presumptive Republican nominee.

Raising funds: Speaking yesterday with Capitol Hill as backdrop, presumptive presidential nominee Mitt Romney speaks out against 'Obamacare'; since the announcement, he raised an estimated $4million

Campaign spokesman Andrea Saul said: 
‘Governor Romney has also had more Facebook engagements and added more 
than three times the amount of Facebook followers as President Obama, 
despite President Obama starting with a Facebook list of over 27 million
people to our over 2 million people.’

The Obama campaign, which has sought 
to project a high-minded message of ‘ordinary Americans are the 
winners’, attacked Mr Romney’s staff for boasting about his fundraising 
success.

‘It's perverse that Mitt Romney won't share details about what he'd do 
for the millions he'd leave uninsured or at the whims of insurance 
companies when he “kills Obamacare dead” but he'll share the hourly 
details of his fundraising after the Supreme Court ruling,' said 
spokesman Ben LaBolt.

In his fundraising email to supporters, Mr Romney had said: ‘Today, the 
Supreme Court upheld ObamaCare. But regardless of what the court said 
about the constitutionality of the law, ObamaCare is bad medicine, it is
bad policy, and when I’m president, the bad news of ObamaCare will be 
over.’

The former Massachusetts governor said the landmark ruling had injected 
fresh impetus into the presidential contest. 'What happened yesterday 
calls for greater urgency, I believe, in the election,' he told donors 
in New York.

'I think people recognise that if you want to replace Obamacare you've 
got to replace President Obama. And the urgency of doing that is 
something which is galvanising people across the country.'

The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Obamacare by a 5 to 4 
majority. Mr Romney has promised to repeal the measure if elected, 
although he introduced a similar reform at the state level in 
Massachusetts.

Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsuerg, a liberal, cited the 
Massachusetts law in her opinion, writing: 'Congress followed 
Massachusetts' lead.' Mr Obama also mentioned it in his address after 
the decision was announced and is sure to raise it during the three 
presidential debates in the autumn.

The dramatic and historic Supreme Court decision represented a major 
short-term victory for Mr Obama and a potential boost to his re-election
chances. Mr Roberts, appointed by President George W. Bush, enraged 
conservative colleagues by siding with the court’s liberals.

But the chief justice may have delivered a political sting in the tail 
for Mr Obama by rejecting his lawyers’ argument that the mandate was 
permissible under the constitution commerce clause and instead ruling 
that Congress could levy fines for non-compliance as a tax.

This enables Republicans to accuse Mr Obama of breaking an election 
promise not to raise taxes – a potent attack line and one that sunk 
President George H.W Bush in the 1992 election.

In September 2009, Mr Obama told ABC News: ‘For us to say that you’ve 
got to take a responsibility to get health insurance is absolutely not a
tax increase. 

‘What it’s saying is, is that we’re not going to have other people 
carrying your burdens for you anymore than the fact that right now 
everybody in America, just about, has to get auto insurance. Nobody 
considers that a tax increase.’

Hiding his happiness: President Obama addressed the Supreme Court ruling and while he did tout the benefits of the legislation, he also instilled the importance of moving past the issue

Republican response: Speaker of the House John 
Boehner (left) and Majority Leader Eric Cantor (right) said that they 
disagreed with the ruling and Mr Cantor announced a scheduled vote to 
repeal on July 11

WHO DOES IT AFFECT?

The
decision affects nearly every American and marks a major milepost in a 
century of efforts to make health care available to all.

WILL ANYONE NOT BE COVERED BY IT?

An
estimated 26 million people will remain without health coverage once 
the law is fully implemented, including illegal immigrants, people who 
don't sign up and elect to face the fine instead, and those who can't 
afford it even with the subsidies.

WHAT NOW?

The
2010 health care law will continue phasing in as planned. It's expected
to bring coverage to about 30 million uninsured people, so that more 
than 9 in 10 eligible Americans will be covered.

Some
parts are already in effect: Young adults can stay on their parents' 
insurance up to age 26. Insurers can't deny coverage to children with 
health problems. Limits on how much policies will pay out to each person
over a lifetime are eliminated. Hundreds of older people already are 
saving money through improved Medicare prescription benefits. And 
co-payments for preventive care for all ages have been eliminated.

WHAT'S NEXT?

Starting
in 2014, almost everyone will be required to be insured or pay a fine. 
There are subsidies to help people who can't afford coverage. Most 
employers will face fines if they don't offer coverage for their 
workers. Newly created insurance markets will make it easier for 
individuals and small businesses to buy affordable coverage. And 
Medicaid will be expanded to cover more low-income people.

Insurers
will be prohibited from denying coverage to people with medical 
problems or charging those people more. They won't be able to charge 
women more, either. During the transition to 2014, a special program for
people with pre-existing health problems helps these people get 
coverage.

An assortment of tax increases, health industry fees and Medicare cuts will help pay for the changes.

IS THE ISSUE SETTLED NOW?

Not
necessarily. Although the court found it constitutional, the health 
care law still could be changed by Congress. Romney and Republican 
congressional candidates are campaigning on promises to repeal it if 
elected in November.

                               ---The Associated Press

Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican chief whip of the House of 
Representatives was one of first to rename Obamacare – initially a term 
of conservative contempt but later embraced by the White House – 
Obamatax.

Mr Obama’s 2009 words denying his bill was a tax have already been 
turned into an ‘Obamatax’ attack video by Ben Howe of the conservative 
video company Mister Smith Media.

Sarah Palin, the 2008 vice-presidential nominee and a Tea Party darling,
sent out a tweet saying: 'He said it wasn't a tax. Obama lies; freedom 
dies.'

Mr Romney immediately seized on the tax argument as a way of linking 
healthcare to the ailing economy – the centrepiece of his election 
strategy.

He used the term Obamacare no fewer than 18 times. 'Obamacare was bad 
policy yesterday,’ he said. ‘It's bad policy today. Obamacare was bad 
law yesterday. It’s bad law today. Let me tell you why I say that. 
Obamacare raises taxes on the American people by approximately 
$500billion.’

Mr Obama was visibly buoyed by the decision, which stunned official 
Washington, which had been expecting the law to be struck down. He 
sought to portray his pursuit of the reform, which had eluded presidents
for half a century, as a historic act of statesmanship.

‘It should be clear by now that I didn't do this because it was good 
politics,' he quipped. ‘What the country can't afford to do is re-fight 
the battles of two years ago.

'Today I'm as confident as ever that when we look back five years from 
now, or ten years from now, or twenty years from now, we'll be better 
off because we had the courage to pass this law and keep moving 
forward.'

Mr Romney, speaking close to the Supreme Court on Capitol Hill minutes before Mr Obama, said: 'I agree with the dissent.

'What the court did not do in its last day in session, I will do in my first day if elected President of the United States.’

Committing himself to repealing the healthcare law, he said: ‘Our 
mission is clear - If we want to get rid of Obamacare, we're going to 
have to replace President Obama.’

The dueling addresses and the stark policy differences ensured that 
healthcare would be a key issue in the final four months of the election
campaign, probably second only to jobs.

Justice Anthony Kennedy, normally considered the swing vote on the 
court, sided with the three consistent conservatives Antonin Scalia, 
Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito in opposing the decision.

It was a major surprise that Mr Roberts aligned himself with the liberal 
justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena 
Kagan.

Was the Supreme Court right to uphold individual mandate in Obamacare?

Although the White House had urged Democrats not to ‘spike the ball’ if 
they prevailed before the court, many liberals were jubilant.

Patrick Gaspard, executive director of the Democratic National 
Committee, tweeted: ‘it's constitutional. Bitches'. Minutes later, he 
added: ‘I let my scotus excitement get the better of me. In all 
seriousness, this is an important moment in improving the lives of all 
Americans.’

The Obama campaign sent out a tweet saying ‘Still a BFD’, a reference to
a remark by Vice President Joe Biden, caught by a microphone, that 
healthcare reform was a ‘big f***ing deal’. The Obama campaign then 
started selling $30 t-shirts that said: ‘Health Reform Still a BFD’.

The Romney campaign branded the use of bad language ‘not presidential’ –
a move undermined somewhat by Romney ally Donald Trump sending out a 
tweet that said: ‘Judge Kennedy should be proud of himself for sticking 
to his principles, in light of Justice Roberts’ bulls***!’
