Working parents are to be given thousands of pounds a year toward the cost of childcare.

Radical proposals at the heart of a new Coalition deal to be unveiled today will see generous tax breaks being offered to families with children under five who need to pay for nurseries and childminders.

Britain has some of the highest childcare costs in the world, meaning the typical mother with one child and a full-time job needs to work for up to four months of the year just to break even. Millions with two or more children conclude it is not worth working at all.

David Cameron and Nick Clegg will mark the halfway point in their Government by making reform of childcare a key priority for the next two and a half years.

Ministers are to meet later this week to finalise a deal expected to be worth up to £2,000 per year per child for all working parents.

The Prime Minister and his Lib Dem deputy will insist the coalition is 'steadfast and united' – and risk alarming party grassroots by hinting at a fresh deal between the Tories and Lib Dems after the next election by claiming their sense of 'shared purpose' has 'if anything grown over time'.

As well as childcare, the Coalition's 'mid-term review' will commit to:

A cap of around £75,000 on elderly care costs;

A more generous flat-rate state pension, to be worth around £155 a week after 2015;

Planning reforms to encourage housebuilding and more state mortgage guarantees to help first-time buyers;

A new 'freedom bill' to limit the reach of the state, including reining in criminal record checks for volunteers;

Allowing private companies to build and run new toll motorways and trunk roads.

Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg, making a rare joint appearance in Downing Street, will list deficit reduction, welfare reform, tougher school standards, council tax freezes, protecting the NHS, help with energy bills, fuel duty cuts and increases in the personal income tax allowance as among the Government's achievements.

In a nod to Labour's lead in the opinion polls, they will claim they have 'consistently chosen to do what is right over what is easy or popular; what is in our country's long-term interest over our parties' short-term interest'.

Aides said many of the measures will be legislated on in this Parliament, but will only be implemented after 2015. Mr Cameron suggested yesterday he wants to serve as Prime Minister until at least 2020 to see them through.

'We will support working families with their childcare costs. We will build more houses and make the dream of home ownership a reality for more people,' Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg write in a foreword to the new Coalition deal.

One suggestion in Whitehall is for a third of the cost of childcare to be made tax deductible.

But senior sources suggested a simpler, flat-rate voucher system was more likely to be announced when final details are made public next week.

This is seen as a fairer option, since it would be worth the same for every family regardless of income.

One source said the scheme would be implemented before the next election, since it is seen as a key vote winner.

The favoured model would more than make up for the loss of child benefit for better-off families that comes into effect today – but only for those where both parents work.

It is not clear how the cost of the scheme will be met, though scrapping existing workplace childcare vouchers that give some parents a monthly sum tax-free will go some of the way.

Red tape deemed unnecessary – such as adult to child ratios required by organisations offering childcare – will be scrapped.

Banks were last night given four more years and greater flexibility to build up cash reserves to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis.

Global regulators watered down a draft plan and gave banks until 2019 to comply with rules making them hold enough liquid assets to avoid taxpayers having to bail them out.

They also said a broader range of assets would be considered eligible – including high quality mortgage-backed bonds – under the new system.
