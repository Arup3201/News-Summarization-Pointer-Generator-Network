Avid fans of one red headed blogger were left bemused as Facebook linked her posts to a ‘similar’ page – that of a flame-haired porn star.

Erika Napoletano, an author, marketing expert and former TEDTalk speaker, who blogs at RedHead Writing, realised when the social media giant gets it wrong, they get it very wrong.

The site’s targeted advertising algorithms, used to tailor the ads a person sees on their page, suggested fans of RedHead Writing might also be interested in Camille Crimson’s page.

Mix up: Blogger and marketing executive Erika Napoletano was bombarded with messages to say Facebook's targeted advertising was linking her blog page with that of Canadian porn star Camille Crimson

There Camille, a Canadian model, web developer and editor, says ‘I write on my blog about sexy things,’ describing herself as a ‘geeky redhead b***job devotee’.

The social networking site linked Miss Crimson’s pages, which have 15,000 likes, ‘The Art of B***job’ and ‘Slow-Motion B***job’ with Miss Napoletano’s blog page, which has 11,000 likes.

Writing her RedHead blog, Ms Napoletano, from Denver, Colorado, said: ‘For the past few weeks, I’ve gotten a flood (a metric f**kton, if you will) of emails, Facebook messages, and wall posts from readers informing me of the following:  

'Seth Stern: Speaking of branding, this “Similar to Redhead writing… Camille Crimson”, was posted immediately under this post in my news feed.

‘Two thoughts, #1, Facebook is sentient and knows what I want. #2, Facebook is drunk.’

But days later, taking the mix up in 
good spirits, she took to her Facebook page posting: ‘Since Facebook 
thinks I’m a porn star, I decided to rebrand. Enjoy today’s blog.’

Seductive: Flame-haired porn star Camille Crimson blasted the 'Facebook FAIL'

The red head then added a gallery of seductive shots of her posing on a bed, topless and covering her modesty with her arm.

She said: ‘Now, Camille’s a pretty hot sandwich and I’m flattered that Facebook thinks we’re similar.

‘After
all we are both redheads. We both have freckles. Might I also say that 
we both respectively have a nice set of boobs? And we’re both industry 
professionals.’

Initially Miss Napoletano assumed her fellow red head must have launched an advertising campaign targeting keywords and interest, including red hair or redhead.

But she added: ‘Camille (a very lovely lady) contacted me and said she’s not running Facebook ads. So yeah – this is all the work of Facebook’s awesome algorithms. They’re drunk. How awesome is that?!’

Taking to her Facebook page, Camille Crimson added: ‘Facebook decided that this (non-porn) red head, Redhead Writing and I have similar pages.

‘She wrote a great piece about our common trait: our hair!

'Plus, she took some beautiful photos to highlight our potential similarities, (to clarify, I didn't buy any Facebook ads. Facebook FAIL).’

A Facebook spokesperson said: 'At Facebook we're always trying to help people discover things that might be interesting to them. 

'We use some pretty smart, complex technology that gets it right most of the time. In this case, the technology made an unfortunate comparison.

'It's definitely not a reflection on Erika and we're glad she took it in good humour. We're satisfied that this is a pretty rare case.'
