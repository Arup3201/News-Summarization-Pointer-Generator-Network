Their plans for a futuristic £5million eco-home - complete with a sound-proofed cinema, solar panelled pods and a garish waterfall - were never going to be to everyone's taste.

And it seems lottery millionaires Matt and Cassey Topham's new neighbours in upmarket Adams Hill in Nottinghamshire are distinctly unimpressed.

After the Mail yesterday revealed how the young couple are planning to spend part of the £45million they scooped on the lottery on a bizarre new mansion, those living in the surrounding houses raised their eyebrows at the plans.

The £1.2 million house in Nottingham will be transformed into an eight bedroom eco-home named 'Serenity'

The couple will move into a far larger home than their previous one. Their new property appeared as 'Wayne Manor' in the latest Batman film The Dark Knight Rises

Neighbours described the home as being 'very out of character for the area' and looking like 'a collection of turtles'. Former painter and decorator Matt, 24, and his new wife Cassey, 23, a former Iceland supermarket supervisor, were described as 'lucky people with bad taste'.

After winning the Euromillions in February 2012, the newlyweds, who were living in a £89,950 ex-council house in Stapleford, Nottinghamshire, announced they would spend some of the money on a 'dream home'.

Within seven months, the Tophams had bought a 1930s mansion in Adams Hill, Nottingham, for £1.2million - which they now plan to demolish to make way for their new home, a £5million eight bedroom eco-home named 'Serenity'.

Proposals for the house, which were lodged with the local authority on Thursday, outline how the property will boast a sound-proof cinema, a botanical garden and a swimming pool.

Baca, the London-based architects behind the design, have described the property as a '21st century country house and hidden retreat'

The home will include four wings or 'hubs' covered in solar panels, a dramatic sweeping staircase inside, and a garage with space for 10 cars.

There they will keep their expanding collection of vehicles, including a Jaguar XKR-S and Range Rover Evoque, which are worth a combined £150,000. Mr Topham is also said to have bought a Porsche and an Aston Martin DB9 to replace the Peugeot 107 the couple used to share.

The cars will be hidden by a waterfall of rainwater, which will flow from one pool at the centre of the mansion to a second pool below.

The home, said to be fit for a Bond villain, will also back onto the grounds of a stunning country house which appeared as 'Wayne Manor' in the latest Batman film The Dark Knight Rises.

Baca, the London-based architects behind the design, have described the property as a '21st century country house and hidden retreat' which is 'ultra-low in energy use but also high in aesthetic aspiration and quality'.

Lottery winners Matt Topham and Cassey Carrington have planned to create a home which neighbours are disgusted by

But locals in the exclusive neighbourhood of Adams Hill, Nottingham, said it looked 'tasteless' and 'disgusting'.

Houses on the road, one of the most sought after in the area, sell for an average of £1.4million.

Princess Diana stayed at a house there in 1990 when Prince Charles was receiving treatment at the nearby Queen's Medical Centre hospital for an elbow he damaged while playing polo.

Housewife Lina Alamoudia, 30, said of the Tophams' new home: 'I don't like it at all. It looks like a collection of turtles. It is very out of character for the area.

'It is very unusual. With all that money they could have designed something far prettier. I haven't met them, or seen them at all since they moved in. They are lucky people with bad taste.' Another neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: 'It might be an eco-home and good for the environment but it looks pretty disgusting to me.

'It certainly isn't my cup of tea, and I think that would go for most people around here too.' A Nottingham City Council spokesman confirmed that an application had been received to demolish the Tophams' current home and build a new property on the site.

He said its fate would be decided in July, adding: 'Planning officials have not had time to scrutinize the plans in detail but preliminary discussions have already taken place.

'The formal process of examining the application has now begun. Among the issues to be examined are any impact the new property would have on the surrounding area, including people who live locally.'
