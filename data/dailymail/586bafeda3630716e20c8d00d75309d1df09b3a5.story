Significant blow: David Cameron, pictured in New York, had tried to take the sting out of the vote

More than 100 Conservative MPs condemned the Government last night for not bringing forward an EU referendum Bill.

A total of 130 MPs, including 12 Labour rebels and DUP members, backed an unprecedented motion expressing 'regret' that last week's Queen's Speech did not include legislation paving the way for a referendum.

In all, 114 Tories – more than half the party's backbenchers and one in three of its MPs – backed the amendment.

Ministers abstained on the issue, in 
which Tory backbenchers were allowed a free vote. The vote was the most 
significant on Europe since October 2011, when 81 Tory MPs revolted in a
 bid to call for an in/out referendum.

Backbencher Peter Bone, one of the leaders of last night's revolt, said MPs had simply voted to reinforce 
the Conservative Party's position and claimed Labour would now have to 
make its position clear.

But the scale of the Tory rebellion 
was a significant blow for David Cameron, who had tried on Tuesday to 
take the sting out of the vote by unveiling draft legislation, to be 
adopted by a Conservative MP and backed by the leadership as a Private 
Member's Bill.

The Liberal Democrats have refused to
 countenance a Government Bill, arguing that talk of an EU referendum in
 2017 is causing uncertainty for business leaders.

'Hypocrite': Tory MPs brandished a 2010 leaflet, right, featuring Mr Clegg, left, promising an EU referendum

Nick Clegg, however, standing in for 
Mr Cameron at Prime Minister's Questions, surprised MPs when he said it 
was a question of 'when, not if' to hold an in/out referendum.

The Prime Minister, on a visit to the
 US, accused both Mr Clegg and Labour leader Ed Miliband of 'burying 
their heads in the sand' over Europe and defended his handling of the 
referendum debate.

Speaking in New York he said his 
pledge to hold an in/out referendum by December 31, 2017, was a 'very 
clear, popular and right position which is in the national interest'. He
 added: 'The other parties have got to make their mind up.'

In the Commons, Mr Clegg was 
condemned as a 'hypocrite' by Tory MPs having promised an in/out 
referendum on the Lisbon Treaty, the last major transfer of powers from 
Britain to Brussels, when it was signed by Gordon Brown. 

Rebels: David Cameron's three-day trip to the U.S. has been over-shadowed by Tory infighting over Europe

The Deputy Prime Minister dismissed 
Tory calls for the Lib Dems to allow a Government Bill paving the way 
for a vote on remaining in the EU, which Mr Cameron has vowed to hold if
 he wins the next election.

'Get me out of here': Nadine Dorries declared she wants to stand on a joint ticket with UKIP

Mr Clegg insisted the Coalition had 
already legislated to guarantee a referendum if there was a significant 
transfer of powers to Brussels.

But he then went further, suggesting 
that an in/out referendum was inevitable: 'By the way I think it's a 
question of when, not if, because the rules are bound to change.'

Aides suggested later that Mr Clegg 
believed an in/out referendum would have to be held when countries in 
the eurozone agreed a new treaty to allow them to integrate more 
closely, even if that meant no new powers being transferred from Britain
 to the EU.

However, Mr Cameron accused the other party leaders of trying to ignore the fundamental changes going on in the EU.

'The single currency is driving a 
massive process of change in Europe and so as a result Britain needs to 
get its stance with respect to this massive change right,' he said.

'There are various responses you can 
make – sticking your head in the sand and pretending nothing has changed
 and just carrying on and accepting everything that comes out of 
Brussels.

'This is not a sensible approach - 
although it does seem to be the approach some in British politics seem 
to take – or you can say Europe is changing, Britain needs to be a part 
of forging that change.

'Just as the eurozone countries come 
together and do more things together, so those countries outside the 
eurozone need to work out how they're going to make their relationship 
work with Europe.

Rebel: Conservative Nadine Dorries said it is 'important that the Right unites' over Europe

'It makes sense at the end of that to
 give British people the proper choice, which is not just do you back 
this new treaty, but do you back Britain being in this reformed 
organisation or coming out of it?'

Mr Cameron dismissed talk of a 'rebellion' in the Commons, pointing out it was a free vote.

George Osborne hailed the draft 
legislation on an EU referendum. He said: 'Labour cannot answer the 
simple question: do they rule out offering an in/out referendum?'

Tory grandee Edward Leigh said: 'I've
 been arguing for a referendum for 20 years. Only yesterday our Prime 
Minister became the first party leader to actually draw up a real Bill.

'This is not just a paper promise, the sort of thing that Nick Clegg wriggles out of.' 

But at a meeting of Conservative MPs,
 Foreign Secretary William Hague was urged by arch-Eurosceptics to hold 
an EU referendum before 2017.
