A jet rolled into a Florida pond on Saturday morning.

The incident occurred at the Spruce Creek Fly-In in Port Orange, according to a report by WFTV.

Deputies told the station that all three passengers on the jet were able to escape safely.

Officials told WFTV that the Cessna 525B 'ran off the runway.' They reportedly used airbags to float the plane and let it dry out.

Universal Towing Company of Holly Hill was later used to remove the aircraft, according to WESH.
