The Super Bowl will be staked out by snipers and SWAT teams while fighter jets fly overhead as part of a tight blanket of security around Sunday's game. 

As a 'level-one' national security event, Super Bowl XLVIII at the MetLife stadium in New Jersey will be tightly locked down by federal, state and local authorities.

Snipers will keep a close eye from birds' nests in the roof of the stadium as the Denver Broncos take on the Seattle Seahawks in front of 82,000 fans.

Despite no specific terror threats 
against the Super Bowl, federal and local authorities have security 
teams on high alert and studied intelligence about recent attacks on 
mass transit in Russia, law enforcement officials said this week. 

'Certainly, we're keeping an eye on 
activities around the world, but as of this time, there are no threats 
directed against this event that we're aware of,' New York City Police 
Commissioner William Bratton said a security briefing in Manhattan on Wednesday.

Snipers are part of a typical security program at the Super Bowl. Former FBI agent Jonathan Gilliam told my9nj.com: 'Snipers have a better angle then anyone who is on the ground to actually hit that target. It’s an entire team that communicates.

'You have individuals who are at high altitudes inside the arena and then you have individuals that are on the ground moving in and around the crowd.'

Lt. Anthony Gracia of New Jersey's North Newfield Police Department told examiner.com that fighter jets from the Continental United States Aerospace Defense Command Region are set to protect the skies around the stadium in Meadowlands.

Because
 this year's Super Bowl has the distinction of relying on mass transit 
to take up to 30,000 fans to the game, the deadly bombings in the 
southern Russian city of Volograd have raised worries here, said Col. 
Rick Fuentes, head of the New Jersey State Police.

Security is also tight around Super Bowl Boulevard in Times Square, according to NYPD chief William Bratton who said officers had been running safety drills for weeks

The suicide attacks on a trolleybus and a train station that killed more than 30 people within weeks of the Winter Olympics also prompted a series of meetings among the planners for Super Bowl security, he said.

Local officials are counting on the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security 'to keep an eye on and brief us on those events,' Fuentes said. 'There is a concern with mass transit and we've prepared ourselves for it.'

Trains, buses and cars taking fans from New York and parts of New Jersey to the stadium and back again 'are going to be scanned, they're going to be checked, they're going to be swept,' he said.

In Manhattan, the NYPD is drawing on its experience securing the annual New Year's Eve celebration in Times Square, the New York City Marathon, the U.N. General Assembly and other high-profile events to secure 'Super Bowl Boulevard' - a 13-block street fair on Broadway.

The department has deployed hundreds of extra uniformed and plainclothes police officers to the area.

It's also relying on bomb-sniffing dogs, portable radiation detectors and a vast network of surveillance cameras to detect trouble.

In the weeks leading up to the Super Bowl, the NYPD rehearsed its response to a variety of potential threats, including 'the backpack left unsecured scenario,' Bratton said. 'We are very, very well-prepared.'

The state police plan to assign up to 700 troopers at the stadium on Sunday, Fuentes said.

A security center has been set up in a hollowed-out building across a highway from the stadium that's slated to become a mammoth retail and entertainment complex.

A 24-hour FBI command center will monitor the latest counter-terrorism intelligence, said Aaron Ford, head of the FBI's Newark office.

Measures have been taken to protect power grids and to make sure there's plenty of backup energy in case of another blackout like the one last year at the game in New Orleans, said Jeffrey Miller, the NFL's head of security.

'This year we're going to try to go blackout free,' Miller said. 'One thing that I've learned is that you don't want to be overconfident. You want to prepare and be ready. You just don't know what you might face on game day.'

Randy Killikevc, a tourist from Tennessee who attended a Super Bowl party in Byrant Park on Wednesday, said possible threats against the Super Bowl weren't on his mind.

'If terrorists were going to strike New York why not do it on New Year's Eve? There's lots more people here (then),' he said.
