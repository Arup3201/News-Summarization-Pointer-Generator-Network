Milos Raonic is through to the Brisbane International final after defeating US Open finalist Kei Nishikori in a pulsating encounter over three tie-break sets.

The 24-year-old Canadian prevailed 6-7(4), 7-6(4), 7-6(4) in just over two and a half hours in a match of high-quality tennis as neither player dropped serve.

Only two points separated the pair as Raonic reached the final on Sunday to take on 17-time Grand Slam champion Roger Federer, who is aiming for a 1,000th career win.

Both Raonic and Nishikori won 77 per cent of their service points and matched each other saving all three break points faced on serve.

Raonic, the world No 8, will need to replicate this fine form against Federer considering his negative head-to-head record of seven to one against the Swiss.

In his 14th ATP World Tour final, Raonic will hope to deny Federer a 1,000th career win after the world No 2 defeated Grigor Dimitrov 6-2, 6-2 in the other semi-final on Saturday.

The Brisbane International is used as a warm up event to the first Grand Slam tournament of the season, the Australian Open, which begins on January 19.

The draw has already begun to open up with US Open champion Marin Cilic and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga withdrawing from the tournament in Melbourne with injuries.
