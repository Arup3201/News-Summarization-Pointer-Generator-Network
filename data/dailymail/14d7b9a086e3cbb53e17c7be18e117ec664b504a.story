Peter Reid says the inaugural Indian Super League heralds a time for India to shed its ‘poor boy image’.

The 58-year-old former England international midfielder is manager of Mumbai City who kick off the new season on October 12 against Atletico de Kolkata

Organisers hope this is the start of a new dawn in India with the launch of the high-profile ISL and the country hosting the Fifa U17 World Cup in 2017.

The league has taken three years to get off the ground, and those involved hope it will help loosen cricket’s stranglehold on India’s sporting public.

Similar to the steps taken by the USA’s NASL in the 1970s, the league will boast some big names, albeit ageing ones, from Europe, with Freddie Ljungberg, Nicolas Anelka, Robert Pires, Alessandro del Piero, Mikael Silvestre and David Trezeguet among them.

The league represents a huge investment with money coming from India’s booming businesses and Bollywood stars but the aim is to attract younger generations to participate and sustain the interest across the country.

Reid said: ‘I feel this is the right time for football in India to shed its poor boy image. This is what happened in England when open terraces went and seating was forced on the teams. The rate of a ticket is high but, now, everything comes at a price.

‘The key message is that football can make everything attainable. We are working with the community too and encouraging their participation. I’m a big cricket fan and cricket is huge here but we want football to become another major part of their lives.’

R‘We went to watch a game the other day and there was real mixture of people in the crowd. All aspects of life and that’s what we want football to be about. It’s a game for the people and we want the people of India to embrace the sport and fall in love with the game,' he added.

Reid has welcomed Anelka and Ljungberg to Mumbai over the past few days as excitement mounts for the season’s kick-off and he insists he aims to entertain but win.

‘I have a philosophy and I like to use the wingers. But I have to look at my players and play according to strength. If I have players who pass the ball, then we pass the ball. But in these conditions (heat and humidity), we need to adapt well, not pass the ball excessively.

Anelka is looking to resurrect his career after leaving the Premier League under a cloud of controversy

‘We want to be able to adapt our style to win. I am not preparing anyone in Mumbai City to face Barcelona. However, what people forget about Barcelona is their pressing game, the way they get the ball back. If we can get that kind of shape at the back, I would be happy.

‘It’s a simple process, when you have the ball, keep it...when you don’t, try and get the ball.’

Talking to the Times of India, Reid added: ‘I am coming here to coach players I don’t know. Obviously I know Nickolas Anelka, I know Freddie Ljunberg, but the Indians, I am learning.

‘It is a new league, it’s exciting. The players are getting to know me.’

India icon Sachin Tendulkar added to the romance of the occasion  by bringing in former East Manchester FC player Duleep Menon to play for his franchise Kerala Blasters, who are coached by David James.

Menon, 27, has been drafted in after impressing during a friendly playing for Central Excise against Blasters in Thrissur.

Duleep, from Kochi, studied in England in 2011 and played for semi-pro side East Manchester who play in the Premier Division of the FBT Manchester Football League.

‘I was stunned to see Sachin at the hotel lobby in the morning,’ said Duleep. ‘I couldn’t say a word when he conveyed his best wishes to me and tears trickled down from my eyes. Sachin asked me to calm down. It feels like a dream.’

David James said: ‘He was superb against us in that practice game. Soon after the match I said that we could make use of this guy.’
