A motorist who drove eight miles down a motorway in the wrong direction before colliding with a police car has been jailed.

A video released by Hertfordshire Police shows Luke Goodall, 26, driving the wrong way down the A1(M) near Stevenage before crashing into a police car which was blocking the road.

Goodall, from Southampton, admitted dangerous driving and failing to provide a specimen and was today sentenced to eight months in prison and banned from driving for three years.

Sergeant Karl McDermott positioned his police car in the way of Goodall's Ford Fiesta to bring him to a halt

Goodall was seen driving a silver Ford Fiesta south along the northbound carriageway at junction 7 of the motorway at 1.40am on August 7.

He narrowly avoided crashing into several vehicles heading in the opposite direction before police arrived.

Sergeant Karl McDermott was about to set up a rolling roadblock when Goodall arrived, slowing down before colliding with the police car, bringing the Fiesta to a stop.

The video shows Sgt McDermott driving the correct way along the motorway when a pair of headlights appear on the horizon - on the wrong side of the central reservation.

The brave officer slows down, quickly positioning himself in front of Goodall's vehicle before carefully shunting the car, bringing it to a halt.

With Goodall seemingly unaware of what has happened, Sgt McDermott runs from the police car and drags the offender out of the car.

Goodall was later arrested and was today jailed for eight months for dangerous driving and failing to provide a specimen. He was also disqualified from driving for three years

Meanwhile other officers put a road block on the carriageway to reduce further risk of a collision and Goodall was later arrested on suspicion of drink driving and dangerous driving.

As well as being disqualified from driving for three years, Goodall will also have to take an extended driving test before being able to get behind the wheel again. 

Sgt McDermott said: 'Despite the time of night there was still fast-moving traffic on the motorway and the darkness meant drivers had minimal time to avoid the oncoming vehicle.

'I would like to take this opportunity to thank the many witnesses who came forward to provide evidence in this case. It is clear that a number of drivers were left in genuine fear for their lives after describing how Goodall only missed them by inches.

'Goodall is extremely lucky that he did not cause a serious collision that could have resulted in people getting killed or seriously injured. At the time he had no regard for how much danger he was in.'

Sentencing Goodall at St Albans Crown Court, Judge Michael Baker commended Sgt McDermott for his 'significant and brave actions in bringing [Goodall] to a stop'. 

Inspector Phil Bloor said: 'In some circumstances and always as a last resort when there is an immediate risk to life – as was the case in this incident – the only way to stop a dangerous driver is to put a physical barrier in their way. 

'In this case I am certain that the actions of Sgt McDermott and other road policing officers on that night were all that stopped a serious collision from happening.

'The driver was removed from his car for his own safety. Given where the cars were stopped – the fast lane of a motorway – it was imperative that officers acted quickly to arrest him and remove the danger to the public, to themselves and to Goodall himself.

'I hope video footage brings home some of the dangers present on our roads and the lengths police officers will go to keep them safe for everybody.'
