Army sergeant-turned-beauty queen Miss Kansas has revealed the tattoos she has proudly displayed through the Miss America competition were inspired by her father and her quest for peace.

As well as being the second Army recruit
to take part in the contest, 22-year-old Theresa Vail has broken down barriers by having her body ink on show in the bikini round.

She told Good Morning America that she 
had been nervous she was going to get booed when she walked on to stage,
but 'I went out there and I rocked it'.

Vintage lettering of the Serenity Prayer covers her right side - the largest of her two tattoos.

'I rocked it': Theresa Vail, Miss Kansas, showed off her tattoos in the swimsuit section of the Miss America competition on Tuesday - becoming the first contestant ever to reveal her body ink

Mantra: The words on her side show the Serenity Prayer. 'God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change. The courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference'

'God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,' it reads. 'The courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference.'

She told The Star-Ledger that ever since she was a 10-year-old school girl suffering at the hands of bullies she has maintained that same wish - a desire for peace.

A second tattoo is the insignia of the Army Dental Corps on her left shoulder.

She said her father, who is a dentist in the Army and has been a soldier for 33 years, inspired her path in the forces and her desire to work as an Army dentist as well.

'Everything I aspire to be,' she wrote beneath a Facebook photograph of her with her father.

'My whole platform is empowering 
women to overcome stereotypes and break barriers,' she has explained. 
'How can I tell other women to be fearless and true to themselves if I 
can't do the same? I am who I am, tattoos and all.'

Proud: Sergeant Vail, pictured on GMA on Friday morning, said that the competition officials and her fellow competitors had been supportive of her decision to show off her body ink

She added to Good Morning America that competition officials and her fellow contestants had been supportive of her choice to show off her body ink.

For her, a self-confessed 
'conservative', the tattoos carry real meaning - and she said she 
doesn't agree with people who get tattoos that are purely ornamental.

'I don't think they're taboo anymore,' she said. 'It's 2013. Half the girls have tattoos, they're just choosing to cover them.'

The competition's preliminary rounds are
currently taking in place in Atlantic City, where Sergeant Vail is 
strutting her stuff against 52 other competitors.

Although
she has so far not won any of the preliminary categories, the sergeant 
is not letting that put her off her newest mission.

Mission: Sergeant Theresa Vail is representing Kansas in the Miss America pageant

Fresh look: Sergeant Vail is taking part in the contest to break stereotypes

'Tell me no and I go 'head and do it,' she said. 'When I set my mind to something, I give it my all.'

And she has an impressive resume to back that up.

Sergeant
Vail, who loves the outdoors, is a former motorbike racer and claims to
have a great recipe for squirrel stew, joined the army when she was 17.

She
has just signed up for another six years, as well as starting as a 
senior at Kansas University, where she is majoring in Chinese, which she speaks fluently, and 
Chemistry. Her GPA is 3.8.

'Nobody expects
a soldier to be a beauty queen, but I'm all about breaking 
stereotypes,' Sergeant Vail, who has eight siblings, said.

Nine
months ago Sergeant Vail had never considered entering a beauty 
contest, but her commanding officer encouraged her to take part, saying 
she would be an ideal role model.

'I
never thought about it until a mentor, in my unit, explained how the 
recognition could help with what I want to do as a role model,' she 
said.

She joked on GMA that the basic training in the Army had prepared her perfectly for the contest.

'This is hard here,' she said. 'The long nights, the mind games. Basic training definitely prepared me for this.'

The
former motorbike racer, who stopped racing only after breaking all the 
fingers in her right hand, had originally planned to show off her 
archery skills for the talent section.

Great outdoors: Miss Kansas loves to shoot and hunt

Hunter: She can skin a deer and claims to have a great recipe for a squirrel stew with sauerkraut

Ready to serve: Miss Kansas says the pageant helps her empower other women

However, two days before the contest 
she discovered 'projectile objects' were banned so, despite never sung 
professionally before, the young woman taught herself Pavarotti's Nessun
Dorma in under 48 hours.

'I wanted to show that yes, I can be this poised graceful elegant woman but i have this dichotomy,' she told GMA. 'I can also carry a gun.'

Kim Brom, business manager for the Miss Kansas 
pageant, told People: 'I've worked with five former Miss 
Kansas contestants and I've never seen anyone this focused and 
determined.

'She has so many different qualities – she's a hunter, she's in
the military, she's fluent in Chinese, she's very educated and, even 
more than that, she has that unquantifiable star quality.'

The only other Army recruit turned beauty queen was Miss Utah in 2007.

Sergeant Vail's main ambition however, is to empower women - a cause close to her after being bullied for years as a child. 

And, as her story spreads, her Facebook 
page has been inundated with messages from well-wishers across the 
country, thanking her for being an inspiration to young women.

Around
the time Sergeant Vail was suffering from being bullied, she developed 
her love of the outdoor pursuits, which offered her a chance to escape 
the taunts and remind her she was a strong person.

On her website she
said: 'When girls learn they have what it takes to "hang with the guys"
they feel a sense of internal strength, like they can conquer the world
and take care of themselves.'
