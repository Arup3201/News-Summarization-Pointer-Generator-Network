Aaron Cresswell's first goal for West Ham handed them victory over Newcastle. CLICK HERE see the stats behind the game with our Match Zone. 

Eventually, when it came to Newcastle conceding a goal, there was little they could do about it.

Eight hours and eight minutes had lapsed on the watch, their net having been safely guarded for almost two months, when Aaron Cresswell sensed trouble as everybody else stood and watched.

Cheikhou Kouyate sent a hopeless volley towards goal, Cheick Tiote failed to react and the full-back, signed from Ipswich in the summer, crept up behind him and thrashed home past goalkeeper Rob Elliot, who was deputising for the injured Tim Krul.

It was a way befitting of winning this; West Ham laboured but eventually came out on top, with Alan Pardew’s side being reduced to 10 men following two bookings in a minute for Moussa Sissoko after Cresswell’s winner.

This pair of swashbucklers had a week off. Sam Allardyce will shrug, point to being without a number of key players and throw a knowing nudge to the league table. The Hammers are fifth, have striker Andy Carroll fit — winning the majority of his headers — and enjoy options from the bench.

They may look at these three points and wonder of the significance because, make no mistake, West Ham were second best for long spells. ‘It’s a massive victory for us,’ said Allardyce. ‘The opposition who came here had a better run of results than Chelsea — and that’s saying something.

‘To get to 21 points is huge. And you’ve got to give Cresswell a huge amount of credit for his finish.’

But it was hard work. The Magpies were impressively tenacious in hunting down possession and know that, in Ayoze Perez, they finally have a man to hit — something to have gone missing since Carroll upped sticks to Liverpool for £35million three years ago.

It was Perez who dragged an early effort wide after inventive work from Yoan Gouffran and flicked just wide from Sammy Ameobi’s near-post cross.

Carroll had a rather optimistic shout for handball turned down when his volley struck Mike Williamson half a yard away. But West Ham had offered little, appearing to be missing the creativity and brute force of Diafra Sakho and Alex Song, who both offer something different, something Allardyce has not been afforded throughout his time in charge at Upton Park.

Without them — and the equally important Enner Valencia — they lack some intuition on the ball. Even when four on three and breaking at pace, Stewart Downing could only fire over the top.

It is by no means Carroll’s fault but he is too easy a target. There is not the need to take risks in midfield and it makes for occasional sterility going forward.

Tension of old crept in as Newcastle grew into the game further and there were cries of exasperation when the galavanting Cresswell had a rush of blood and ballooned a wild effort over the bar. But in a game lacking genuine quality, fittingly a mis-hit settled things.

Kouyate’s attempt at a half-volley on the edge of the box embarrassingly bobbled goalwards but Cresswell, jumping on Tiote’s indecision, gobbled up the chance to poke beyond Elliot to chalk up his first for the club.

‘It just fell nicely for him and you sensed one goal would be enough,’ said Pardew, after seeing his side’s six-game winning streak end abruptly.

 One would have been enough for them and it should have come. Perez had flashed an effort straight at Adrian and the manager brought on Papiss Cisse in desperate need of an equaliser, but they ran out of ideas.

And down to 10, too. Sissoko allowed frustration to get the better of him when Mike Dean correctly adjudged he had fouled Carl Jenkinson, booting the ball 60 yards away and seeing yellow.

Not a minute later, he was throwing himself at Carroll and that was that. Pardew lowered his head and shook the midfielder’s hand as he trudged off. 

‘He has lost his mind a little bit,’ said Pardew. ‘It’s not like Moussa, he has been outstanding for us. He will apologise to Andy.’

It was over. The glorious run since the beginning of October, to have propelled Newcastle into European contention, was done with a mis-hit and moment of madness. 

And it was topped off by a stoppage-time swing of Cisse’s boot to send the ball flying into the Sir Trevor Brooking Stand.
