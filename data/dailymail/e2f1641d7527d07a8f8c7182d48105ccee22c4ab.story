The taxi driver who picked up Carole and Michael Middleton after they met their grandson for the first time has revealed they didn’t leave a tip.

But Tracy Mitchell still insists that escorting them from St Mary’s Hospital was an ‘incredible’ experience.

She was called to the hospital’s private maternity ward by a third party, and realised the identity of her passengers only when she pulled up.

You'll never guess who I had in my cab! Taxi driver Tracey Mitchell said she cannot stop talking about picking up the Middletons after they met baby George

Happy day: The Duchess of Cambridge's thrilled parents Carole and Michael Middleton leave the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital, and sitting patiently in her cab was Tracy Mitchell

Incredible: Mrs Mitchell admitted she had no idea her £15 fare was for the Middletons

Upon being briefed by a press officer, she exclaimed: ‘I wish I’d known – I’d have done my hair.’

The 49-year-old said Mr Middleton tried to pay the £15 fare when they arrived back at Kensington Palace – but was told it had been paid in advance. He did not, however, offer a tip.

‘They chatted amongst themselves, and she spent much of the journey on the phone,’

Mrs Mitchell said. ‘When we got to the other end I congratulated them on the arrival. They said thank you very much. Very down-to-earth people, they seemed. She was kind of bewildered by it all.’

The cabbie, from the Isle of Dogs in East London, said Mrs Middleton spoke during the 15-minute journey of being ‘overwhelmed’ by the experience.

Mrs Mitchell responded jokily: ‘Imagine what it was like for me as the taxi driver!’

Mrs Middleton replied that she was ‘really sorry’, but Mrs Mitchell laughed off the apology, adding: ‘No, no, it was very exciting for me.’

The driver – and her distinctive bright blue cab – could be seen in news footage of the Middletons emerging from the hospital that was broadcast around the world.

Special moment: Prince William and Kate waved and smiled broadly as they carried their son George out of hospital for the first time

She has driven Lily Allen, Julian Clary and Russell Grant since taking the wheel last year – but described the Middletons as ‘the best’.

‘It was incredible,’ Mrs Mitchell said. ‘I mean, picking up the future king’s grandparents ... it doesn’t get much better than that.

‘It wasn’t until I got there that I was told it was Kate’s mum and dad I was picking up. You really could have knocked me down with a feather, to be honest with you. I was really quite taken aback.’

She had answered a call at about 4pm on Tuesday, and was told to report to the Lindo Wing at St Mary’s in Paddington, West London, where the Duchess had given birth the previous day.  

Mrs Mitchell, who had initially been told she would be picking up someone called Danielle, was then called by a press officer, asking what car she was driving and what colour it was.

Shell-shocked: Mrs Mitchell, from east London, didn't receive a tip and went home shortly afterwards for a beer

Later: The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall arrived at the Lindo Wing after the Middletons, in a Jag, not a cab

‘It didn’t dawn on me that it could be anyone to do with [the birth] or Kate’s mum and dad,’ Mrs Mitchell said. She took one more fare after dropping off the Middletons – and then enjoyed a celebratory bottle of beer at home.

The Middletons themselves were soon entertaining the new prince. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and their new arrival, are now staying at the family’s £4.7million home in Bucklebury, Berkshire.

Meanwhile, the new grandparents’ company Party Pieces is already advertising its baby-themed wares on Facebook with a picture proclaiming: ‘It’s a boy.’

The photo, which appeared at about midday yesterday, shows off several products from the couple’s ‘christening’ and ‘new baby’ ranges, including a rocking-horse cake stand for £11.99.

The Middletons have been accused of cashing in on their daughter’s royal status several times before; their firm launched royal-themed products ahead of the Duke  and Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding in 2011, and the Diamond Jubilee a year later.

A company spokesman said: ‘Party Pieces has specialised in parties to mark children’s births for over 26 years. Our acknowledgment of the birth is entirely appropriate and entirely fitting with our customers’ joyfully received messages of congratulations.’
