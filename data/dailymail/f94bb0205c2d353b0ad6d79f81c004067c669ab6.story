A Florida judge has declared a mistrial in a baby death case after the child's mother testified that her ex-boyfriend threatened to shoot her son in the face - information that was previously agreed upon as being inadmissible in court.

Hillsborough Circuit Judge William Fuente reluctantly called off the trial of Tampa man Richard McTear on Tuesday, ruling Jasmine Bedwell, 22, had poisoned proceedings with the alleged threat and there was no way for the jury to ignore it.

McTear is accused of murdering Bedwell's son, Emanuel Murray Jr., by throwing the three-month-old out the window of a moving car in 2009.

Bedwell's claim that her 25-year-old ex-boyfriend threatened to shoot her and her son and urinate on the child came up originally in a 2010 trial where McTear was found not guilty of battering her.

Prior to the commencement of this week's trial, the court ruled the phone call should not be introduced because it was part of a previous trial - where McTear was ultimately acquitted for assault - and was therefore irrelevant in the murder case.

But Bedwell, a key witness, gasped out the allegation amid tears as soon as she took the stand on Monday.

'The jurors heard testimony they should not have heard under any circumstances. In this court's conclusion, a mistrial is necessary,' Fuente said on Tuesday morning. 'I'll say this: I do this with extreme reluctance. I'm not suggesting that any counsel did anything inappropriate.'

The mistrial ruling will require a new round of jury selection, which is unlikely to happen before December. McTear, who if convicted could be sentenced to death, will remain in jail as he awaits a new trial.

On Monday, Assistant State Attorney Ron Gale had asked Bedwell about phone calls from McTear the day before Emanuel's death.

Bedwell replied saying McTear had called her and 'told me that he was going to come over and shoot my baby in the face and p*** on him, in his face, and he was going to kill both of us.'

Gale acknowledged Bedwell's testimony was 'clearly... a violation' of the court order but he said he had not expected her to refer to the phone call, which took place about six weeks before her son's death.

However, he added that he had not specicially told her not to mentioin in their preparations for testimony.

'It did not come up,' Gale said.

Legal experts applauded Fuente's decision, adding that proper trial procedure must be followed in death penalty cases because convictions are intensively reviewed on appeal.

Monday was the first day of McTear's first-degree murder trial.

McTear's lawyers argue that there is not enough evidence to show his client is responsible for the baby's death.

Prosecutors claim McTear entered Bedwell's apartment by force in May, 2009 and beat her before 
throwing the baby carrier against the wall while the child was inside 
it,Â ABC Action News reported.

He then allegedly drove off with the child and threw him out onto the motorway.

An off-duty TV cameraman spotted the child's body lying by the side of the motorway in Tampa.

Jason Bird said he thought it was a toy doll - until he saw the baby's eyes.

A huge manhunt was launched for McTear who had previous convictions for domestic violence and other violent crimes.

He was found hiding at a friend's house several hours after the incident and was arrested by police.

Authorities in Tampa said Bedwell had called police to her home in the early hours of May 4, 2009.

She alleged she was being attacked by McTear, who is not the father of her son.

Bedwell,
who was then 17, told police her ex-boyfriend grabbed her son and threw
him down onto the pavement. He then picked him up in his carrier and raced off.

Police were about to issue an Amber 
Alert for a kidnapping when the baby's body was found by the side of 
I-275, the main motorway leading into Tampa on Florida's Gulf Coast.

TV
cameraman Bird, who was on his way to work for a local station, said: 
'Just out of the corner of my eye, I thought I saw some trash on the 
side of the road. But the more I thought about it, I saw eyes.

'It flipped me out, and I started shaking and said, 'It's a doll, a baby doll.' '

Police in Florida said Bedwell had sought a court injunction to keep McTear away from her family.

Jasmine Bedwell (pictured left in 2009) became pregnant again after losing her son but her second child was taken away by the state in 2012

But after she failed to turn up for the court hearing the matter was dropped.

McTear is known to police in Tampa and was arrested in 2008 on assault with a deadly weapon and domestic battery.

In 2010, Jasmine Bedwell found out she was pregnant again and gave birth to another son in September of that year.

But
in January of 2012, she had her second child taken away by the 
Department of Children and Families after a judge ruled the boy, A'Jon, 
was in danger.

Her boyfriend at the time had been convicted of cocaine and marijuana distribution and carrying a concealed weapon.
