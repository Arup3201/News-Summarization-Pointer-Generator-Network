Prime Minister David Cameron appears to have taken inspiration from actor Tom Selleck and Magnum P.I. with this rather dashing moustache.

But Mr Cameron hasn't suddenly sprouted a soup strainer, staff at Madame Tussauds attached the 'tache to his waxwork to promote Movember, the male cancer charity fundraiser.

Half a million men are thought to be ditching the razor and cultivating their upper lip warmers for sponsorship. Movember raised £25million last year.

Mr Cameron's waxwork was joined outside a replica of No10 Downing Street by London Mayor Boris Johnson, who also sported a bristling blond moustache.

During November each year, Movember is responsible for the sprouting of moustaches on thousands of men’s faces in the UK and around the world. The aim of which is to raise vital funds and awareness for men’s health, specifically prostate cancer and testicular cancer.

The event started in 2004 and there are now an estimated 1.9m 'Mo Bros' and 'Mo Sistas' throughout the world, raising GBP 79.3 million last year alone.
