Britain's second-biggest fuel supplier has announced punishing price rises.

Scottish & Southern Energy is putting gas up by 18 per cent and electricity by 11 per cent.

The move will add £171 to the annual average dual fuel bill, taking it to £1,265.

Costly business: How SSE, Scottish Power and British Gas's price hikes have affected household bills

Scottish Power - Gas will rise by 19 per cent this August and there will be a 10 per cent jump in electricity.

It will add around £185 to an annual dual fuel bill.

British Gas - Gas is going up 18 per cent and  
electricity by 16 per cent next month.

This will take the average annual 
dual-fuel bill to a record £1,288.

Scottish and Southern Energy - Gas prices will rise by an average of 18 per cent and 
electricity prices by 11 per cent from September 14.

The increase will 
mean a typical annual dual-fuel bill will rise from £1,094 at present to
£1,265 - an increase of £171.

These increases are separate from price rises that the industry says will be required by the Government to fund a £200billion switch to wind farms, solar and nuclear power.

SSE, the third of the 'big six' suppliers to announce big rises, has 5.2million electricity customers and 3.6million with gas contracts, making it second to British Gas in terms of its national reach.

The company claimed the increases reflect a rise in wholesale costs for gas and electricity this year. However, this is challenged by consumer groups.

They point out that wholesale prices are around one third lower than in 2008, yet the prices imposed on customers will now rise to a record high.

Chief executive of the official customer body, Consumer Focus, Mike O’Connor, said: ‘This increase heaps more pressure on to already cash-strapped consumers and will tip many thousands more into fuel poverty.

‘Consumers cannot tell whether these increases are justified and that stokes the lack of trust in energy firms.’

He said the energy regulator Ofgem must get to the heart of whether prices are fair or refer the entire industry to an inquiry by the Competition Commission.

Figures last week revealed that 5.5million in the UK are living in fuel poverty, defined as spending at least 10 per cent of disposable income on heat and light.

Citizens Advice chief executive Gillian Guy said: ‘We are already seeing people self-ration and self-disconnect as they can’t afford their increasing fuel bills. 

Energy: British Gas announced an 18 per cent price hike for gas and 16 per cent price increase for electricity two weeks ago, and now Scottish and Southern Energy has joined them

As
many as half of all consumers have never changed energy supplier since 
deregulation in the late Nineties, according to energyhelpline.com.

Ann
Robinson, of comparison site uSwitch.com, says: 'Despite household 
energy bills having rocketed by almost £500 or 71% in just over 5 years,
consumers are still being asked to pay more. Household finances are 
creaking and groaning.

'There
is no room for complacency and I would urge consumers to act now to 
ensure they are paying the lowest possible price and to reduce the 
amount they use.

Fixing
your energy prices is an option that offers security and peace of mind,
especially for those worried about the impact of price hikes on their 
household budget.'

‘As a result they are going without the heating they need and living in a cold home, which can have a devastating impact on their physical and mental health.’

Ann Robinson, of price comparison website uSwitch.com, said: ‘Despite household energy bills having rocketed by almost £500 or 71 per cent in just over five years, consumers are still being asked to pay more.

‘Household finances are groaning under the weight of price hikes, but the biggest concern is the impact on fuel poverty.’

SSE has promised not to raise prices again before August 2012 at the earliest.

Chief executive Ian Marchant said: ‘I am sorry that we have had to announce an increase in household energy prices at a time when many people’s budgets are under strain, but the upward pressures on prices have become too great.’

Since its last gas price increase, in December, wholesale costs of electricity and gas have risen by 23 per cent and 40 per cent respectively, he said.

Domestic energy consumption in the UK rose by 18 per cent between 1970 and 2009, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said today.

The figure rose from 37 million tonnes of oil equivalent to 44 million tonnes in 2009 - with more than half used for heating.

Statisticians attributed the rise to the increased number of households and changes in energy efficiency and 'external temperatures'.

Authors of the study said that in 2008, 5.6 per cent of all electricity consumption in the UK was generated from renewable resources - an increase compared to 1.7 per cent in 1990.

But the 2008 proportion was dwarfed by the EU average of 16.7 per cent.

UK emissions 'of the basket of greenhouse gases' were estimated to have fallen by more than 27 per cent between 1990 and 2009.

Last year in the UK, the number of days of moderate or higher air pollution were at their lowest level since 1987 in rural areas (22 days) and their lowest level in urban areas since records began in 1993 (eight days).

The details were released by the ONS as part of its 'Social Trends' research.

Other findings included recycling, composting or reuse of household waste increasing considerably in England from less than 1 per cent in 1983/84 to 40 per cent in 2009/10.

In England, in 2009, the environment was thought to be the third most important issue that adults felt the Government should address after the economy and unemployment.
