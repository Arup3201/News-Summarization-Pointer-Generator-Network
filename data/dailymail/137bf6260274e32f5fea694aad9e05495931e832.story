David Cameron faced a barrage of criticism last week after going ahead with a surfing holiday as Iraq descended into turmoil.

But it seems the Islamic State's murderous rampage across the Middle East is still not enough to tempt him back to Number 10. 

For just four days later, he's back on the board despite MPs' calls for an emergency recall as the news is dominated by fears of radicalised Britons.

Riding out the crisis? David Cameron was seen on the beach again as the Islamic State continues its rampage

It comes as task forces across the world race to track down the brutal murderers that assassinated US photojournalist James Foley and posted footage of the killing online. 

United Nations human rights chief Navi Pillay today called on the international community to treat as a priority the 'appalling, widespread' crimes being committed by Islamic State forces in Iraq, including killings, slavery, sexual crimes and targeting people on ethnic or religious grounds.

However, the Prime Minister was seen enjoying the Bank Holiday Monday alongside hundreds of other surfers in Cornwall.

Polls last week revealed more than 80 per cent of British voters do not believe that David Cameron can handle the Iraq crisis from his holiday beach.

He made a flying 19-hour return visit to Downing Street following James Foley's murder  before going back to the south west.

Unfazed: He has admitted there is poor phone signal at the beach but he went out surfing again anyway

Mr Cameron said: ‘Wherever I am in the world I am always within a few feet of a BlackBerry.’ 

But, he admitted, his phone reception in Cornwall is very poor.

On Friday, an onlooker said: 'He seemed pretty relaxed and having a good time by himself.

'He didn't do any real surfing - the conditions weren't really there for it - but he had a go on the body board a couple of times.

Labour MP Ann Clwyd, the former British human rights envoy to Iraq, was equally furious about Mr Cameron's decision to return to his holiday in Britain.

She said: ‘I just find it extraordinary that he has gone off on holiday again after a few hours back in London – it is just not good enough.

Taking advantage of the August gloom: The Prime Minister was one of hundreds of surfers out in the waves today for Bank Holiday Monday as a chilly wind swept over south west England

Packed: It was raining with grey skies but Cornish surfers were undeterred as they hit the waves in their droves

'If he is serious about the threat to Britain, as he says he is and as he ought to be, then he should not be pushing off on holiday.

'He should be recalling MPs to Parliament so that we can discuss the situation and debate our response.'

Up to 670 prisoners from Badush prison in the city of Mosul were killed by Islamic State on June 10 after being taken by truck to a vacant area and screened for non-Sunnis, she said, quoting survivors and witnesses to the 'massacre' as telling UN human rights investigators.

Preparation: These holidaymakers enjoyed the long weekend by preparing for a surfing session

It marked a gloomy end to the final holiday of the summer in 2014 with rain forecast for the coming week

'Such 
cold-blooded, systematic and intentional killings of civilians, after 
singling them out for their religious affiliation, may amount to war 
crimes and crimes against humanity,' Pillay said.

The
 al Qaeda splinter group seized control of the Iraqi city of Mosul on 
June 10, putting security forces to flight in a show of strength against
 the Shi'ite-led Baghdad government.

Pillay,
 a former UN war crimes judge, called on the Iraqi government and 
international community to protect vulnerable ethnic and religious 
communities, including at least 13,000 Shia Turkmen in Salahuddin 
province besieged by ISIL forces since mid-June amid 'fear of a possible
 imminent massacre'.
