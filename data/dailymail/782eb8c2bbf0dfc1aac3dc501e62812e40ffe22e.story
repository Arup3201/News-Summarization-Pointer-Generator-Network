Barack Obama has attempted to create better ties with the U.S. and China by signing a new visa agreement for each other's citizens.

Visitors to both countries will be able to stay for up to 10 years rather than one under a negotiation by the president, announced at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Beijing today.

But there are fears Obama's powers are beginning to wane on the global stage as well as at home after the Democrats lost the power of the Senate during last week's mid-term elections.

Barack Obama announced a change to visas at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Bejing today 

The defeat could affect his position in talks with China as media sources report he is seen as a 'diminished leader on the world stage in his last two years of presidency'.

He put on a bright face as he addressed business leaders at today's summit where he set out to dispel the notion that America's interest in Asia should be a cause of concern for China's leaders.

Beijing has viewed Obama's engagement with trepidation out of concern the U.S. wants to limit China's rise, but Obama insisted that 'one country's prosperity doesn't have to come at the expense of the other.'

'We want China to do well,' Obama said. 'We compete for business, but we also seek to cooperate on a broad range of challenges and shared opportunities.'

Under the visa agreement, due to be issued on Wednesday, U.S. and Chinese citizens will be able to obtain business and short-term tourist visas valid for 10 years, up from one year currently. 

Student and cultural exchange visas will be made valid for five years rather than just one year, Obama said.

 The negotiation will allow citizens to U.S. and China to keep the same visa for 10 years rather than just one with the White House hoping it will bring extra extra money in for the economy

Coming just hours after the president's arrival in Beijing - the first stop on his week-long trip to China, Myanmar and Australia, the announcement offered him an opportunity to portray the U.S. and China as working in good faith. 

However the new visa plans may have only modest implications as it does not increase how long an American can remain in China or vice-versa. 

Rather, it increases the length of time during which a visitor is permitted to enter the country - so a Chinese citizen who visits the U.S. every few years would be able to use the same visa for a decade, rather than having to reapply for a new visa every year.

The U.S. hopes the deal will lure more Chinese travellers to the U.S. - and with it, billions of dollars into the economy.

The White House said it could drive up demand that would create hundreds of thousands of jobs in the U.S., without sacrificing national security. 

About 100 million Chinese travelled last year, but less than 2 percent of those visited the U.S.

But the announcement was set against a backdrop of doubt as critics say his support at home is diminishing.

The Chinese Global Times says that 'US society has grown tired of his banality' and claims Obama 'has done an insipid job, offering nearly nothing to his supporters'.

At the same time, other signs pointed to a heightened sense of competition that have rankled relations between the world's two largest economies.

China is the opening stop of Obama's three-country tour that will test the president's ability to play a commanding role on the world stage during his final two years in office

Only hours earlier, Obama was at the U.S. Embassy hosting heads of state from the 11 other countries — excluding China — that are pursuing a long-delayed trade pact. 

Finalising the Trans-Pacific Partnership is a cornerstone of Obama's much-touted effort to expand U.S. influence and economic presence in Asia, but China has responded by pushing its own regional trade deal with many of the same nations. 

U.S. officials said Obama would have further agreements with China to announce later during his three-day visit when he meets with President Xi Jinping, and the two leaders have common cause when it comes to combating climate change. 

But thornier issues were also on the agenda for Obama's meetings in China, including cybersecurity and China's aggressive posture toward its neighbors.
