Tourists are being urged not to leave padlocks on a Paris bridge to symbolise their love - and to take selfies instead.

Officials in the French capital are cracking down on the gesture, which sees couples leave a 'love lock' on the Pont des Arts, and are advising couples to take photos to post on social media.

The practice of attaching the inscribed padlocks has become so popular that part of the bridge over the Seine collapsed under their weight in June.

From 
Monday, notices will be placed on bridges urging couples to take selfies
 - and post them on social media with the hastag #lovewithoutlocks.

A
 city official told Le Parisien newspaper: 'There was no question of a 
clampdown or penalising tourists who place padlocks, so we're proposing 
that they use a "social wall" instead.'

Tourists
 have been evacuated from one of the most iconic bridges in Paris after 
it began to crumble under the weight of thousands of 'love locks'.

A
 chunk of the Pont des Arts bridge fell away in June and the 
police were called to seal off the area which remained closed for days.

It
 is a popular custom for tourists to secure a padlock to the bridge 
branded with their names as a romantic gesture, with Kourtney Kardashian
 and boyfriend Scott Disick also indulging in the tradition.

Kim Kardashian has also been pictured attaching a lock to the bridge when she visited Paris while pregnant.

But the weight of the locks is damaging 
the metal Ponts des Arts, which was originally completed in 1804 but rebuilt in 
the 1980s following damage in the two World Wars.

A local French police spokesperson said of the collapse in June: 'A metal grille had fallen inwards, rather than into the river.

'If it had landed on a passing boat, the results could have been disastrous. As it happened, nobody was injured.

'The bridge was evacuated, and will now be closed until Monday morning at the earliest.'

It follows growing calls for the padlocks - which also blight other major European cities including London - to be banned.

The famous Paris bridge is said to offer some of the best views along the Seine

It was first built between 1802 and 1804, under the reign of Napoleon, and is a favourite with artists

Due to damage sustained in WW1 and WW2, the bridge was rebuilt between 1981 and 1984

The 'love lock' tradition began in Hungary in the early 20th century, based on a tale of a woman who lost her soldier love to another during WW1. Young women started symbolising their love by attaching padlocks to the bridge where the abandoned woman used to meet her lost lover.

The padlock tradition took hold in Western Europe in the early 2000s and was popularised by an Italian book I Want You by Federico Moccia, in which a couple adds a padlock to the Ponte Milvio in Rome.

In Paris, the ritual began in 2008 on the Pont des Arts but has since extended to the Pont de l’Archevêché near Notre Dame too.

Othe bridges encountering problems from a vast quantity of padlocks being affixed are the Ponte Vecchio in Florence and the Ponte l’Accademia in Venice.

It has 
become common practice for visitors to buy a padlock, attach it to a 
bridge, and then throw the key into the river, in Paris's case the 
Seine.

The
 practice has been encouraged by American celebrities including Kim 
Kardashian and Kanye West, who spent a lot of time dating in Paris 
before their wedding in Italy last month.

The 'Not Love Locks' campaign was launched in Paris by two Americans in 
February, in response to some 700,000 padlocks appearing around the 
city.

All
 bridges have been blighted by the practice, but the Pont des Arts now 
looks like two solid walls of metal divided by a wooden walkway.

'It's so out of control,' says Lisa Anselmo, who co-founded the campaign with fellow writer Lisa Taylor Huff.

Lookout point: The bridge is famed for its spectacular views along the Seine

'People
 are climbing up lampposts to clip locks on, hanging over the bridge to 
put them on the other side of the rail, risking their lives to attach 
one. It's a kind of mania. It's not about romance any more - it's just 
about saying 'I did it.' 

The original was damaged by German bombs during both world wars, but a faithful reproduction was built during the 1980s.

It
 was once considered a hugely romantic bridge, enjoying arguably the 
prettiest views in the city, but many locals argue the padlocks have 
turned it into a tourist trap.
