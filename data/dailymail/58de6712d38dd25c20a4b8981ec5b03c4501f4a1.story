England's World Cup winning captain Bobby Moore has been brought back onto the pitch by the creators of FIFA 15's Ultimate Team Legends, with the game providing a fascinating breakdown of the defender's attributes and how he compares with today's players.

Moore is widely regarded as the finest player to wear an England shirt and EA, the makers of Ultimate Team, show that Moore would undoubtedly be worth, and would have earned, millions if he was playing today.

His defensive capabilities make him a mix of Giorgio Chiellini, a World Cup winner with Italy, Gerard Pique and Thiago Silva but Moore's ball control, passing ability and balance match him with the best midfielders in the game, such as Frank Lampard, Paul Pogba and Andrea Pirlo.

Moore's attributes in the game rank him alongside some of the best present day players 

And it is Lampard, alongside his father Frank Lampard Snr, a team-mate of Moore's at West Ham who played twice for England, who led the tributes to the man who is synonymous with English football.

'I remember stories from my Dad telling me 'this is the type of player you want to be, but also more than that this is the type of man you want to be',' Lampard Jnr said. 'If you were to put Bobby in any era, in the era he played or moving up to the era now with (Lionel) Messi and (Cristiano) Ronaldo, with his quality across the board, he would be able to deal with all of them.' 

The game rates Moore's reactions on par with Bayern Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, at 89.

But Lampard Snr revealed that the one chink in Moore's otherwise gleaming armoury was his pace, but his instinctive reading of the game meant that his speed was seldom exposed.

'He wasn’t the quickest around, but I think a lot of his ability was in his head,' Lampard Snr recalled. 'He used to read everything before anybody else. He was there before it happened basically. You don’t coach that, you’re born with it, but he used it very well.'

Frank Lampard Jnr played for England 106 times, two appearances less than Moore did

Moore's eye for an interception is rated at 91, the same as Paris Saint-Germain's Silva, while his strength in the air is 82, level with Pique. A rating of 89 for marking places him alongside Chiellini.

But it's Moore's ability in possession of the ball that is something which places him outside of his 22-year career span from 1956-78.

Contemporary defenders are expected to be comfortable with the ball at their feet, bringing play out from defence and entwining phases of play from the back into midfield.

With ratings of 82 for both short passing and ball control equalling Paul Pogba and Lampard Jnr respectively, as well as 81 for balance matching Andrea Pirlo, Moore was clearly not just comfortable with playing out from the back, he was very good at it, too.

Ironically, for a man that is emblematic of football in England, it is a style that is not immediately associated with English play.

'If you give a ball away Bobby would never moan at you, he'd just give you a look, a look that said 'we don't do that here, we have to keep the ball',' Lampard Snr said. 'He won the World Cup and he led by example on the pitch. He played so many games for England at the standard that he played at, he is the greatest captain England ever had and England ever will have.' 

Moore played 108 times for England, as well as making 544 appearances for West Ham. He passed away in 1993 at the age of 51 to bowel cancer.
