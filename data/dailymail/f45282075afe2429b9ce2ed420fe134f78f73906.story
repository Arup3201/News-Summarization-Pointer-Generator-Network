Google has launched a touchscreen laptop in a bid to take on Apple in the luxury laptop market.

The £1049 (£1299) Chromebook Pixel has a high resolution display that makes individual pixels invisible to the naked eye.

Although Apple has a similar display, Google says the addition of touch, and 1TB of free storage on an online hard drive, make its machine more attractive to 'power' users.

'We wanted to rethink everything possible in a laptop,' said Sundar Pichai of Google, who revealed the machine at a special event run in Silicon Valley and London..

'The screen is the highest resolution 
screen ever shipped on a laptop, and we don't want users to deal with 
pixels - so users will never see them.

'People want to reach out and touch - so we built in full touch.'

The laptop, the first Google has designed and built itself, will be made in Taiwan.

It will compete directly with Apple.

'Apple has been at this a long time, and has built something amazing,' Pichai said of Apple's products.

'But if If you live in the cloud this is the best experience you can have.'

The machine uses Google's Chrome OS, which is based on the firm's web browser.

Although it does have a hard drive like a traditional laptop, Google also gives buyers a 1TB drive on on it's 'cloud' service, which is free for three years - although the firm said it did not know how much users would have to pay to keep this after three years.

'We believe that's about the lifespan of the Pixel,' said Mr Pichai.

He said the firm expected other manufacturers to release touchscreen laptops soon.

'Pixel is a fully finished project -
but we hope it will show that Chrome is is ready for touch,' he said.

Google has already developed special touch versions of its apps, and said it expected other developers to do so quickly.

Versatile: The computer comes with a clip-on keyboard allowing users to easily transform the device into a mere touchscreen pad

The gadget will compete with Microoft's recent Surface tablet, which has a clip-on keyboard to turn it into a 'real' laptop.

A
Pro version capable of running the firm's latest Windows 8 software, 
and costing $999 in the US, was recently released, but the firm has 
refused to reveal sales details or say when it could become available in
other countries.

The £1049 Pixel will compete against both Tablets and laptops.

Here are its main competitors:

Intel has also been working manufacturers on 'convertible' laptops, called ultrabooks.

Some
designs have screen that flip over, while others rotate, allowing the 
gadget to be used as both a traditional laptop and a tablet.

The firm also hit back at complaints that users could become confused between the laptop and tablet running its Android software.

'Now the lines are blurring, we have two viewpoints here and we are doing both - we are giving a choice to the world,' he said.

The Pixel has a square design, and Google says it even developed a special glass for the trackpad to make it more comfortable than competitor's products
