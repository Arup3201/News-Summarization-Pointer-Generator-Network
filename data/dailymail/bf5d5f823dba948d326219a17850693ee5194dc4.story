The first gay weddings will be held in Britain next summer after the Queen signed off landmark laws.

MPs cheered in the Commons as it was announced the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill had been given royal assent.

Ministers hailed the ‘historic moment’ and Stephen Fry declared 'hurrah, hurray hurroo!’ but Catholic bishops warned it heralded ‘profound social change’.

Legal: The Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill has now passed into law, clearing the way for the first gay weddings in summer 2014

The legislation had proven deeply controversial, with David Cameron accused of pushing it through despite it not being in either the Tory or Lib Dem manifestos in 2010.

Dozens of Conservative MPs tried to derail the Bill which only passed the Commons with the support of Labour and Lib Dem votes.

However last night it cleared the House of Lords, and today Commons Speaker John Bercow announced it had become law.

He told MPs: ‘I have to notify the House in accordance with the Royal Assent 1967 that Her Majesty has signified her Royal Assent to the following acts... Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill.’

Stephen Fry lead the Twitter 
tributes, writing: ‘Thanks, Your Majesty, for the Royal Assent. You soon
 won't be the only married queen in Britain. Hurrah, hurray hurroo!’

MPs last night decided not to oppose a number of minor changes made by the Lords to the Bill.

Among the changes agreed were protections for transgender couples which will allow people to change sex and remain married.

There will also be a review of whether
 belief organisations such as the Humanists will be allowed to carry out
 marriages, while ministers said they were prepared to look at 
eliminating any difference in the treatment of gay couples when it came 
to pension schemes.

Vincent Nichols, Archbishop of Westminster, warned the move heralded 'profound social change'

Equalities minister Maria Miller said she was looking forward to the first same-sex marriage by next summer.

He
 said: ‘Marriage is the bedrock of our society and now irrespective of 
sexuality everyone in British society can make that commitment.

‘Making marriage available to all couples demonstrates our society's respect for all individuals regardless of their sexuality.

'It demonstrates the importance we attach to being able to live freely. It says so much about the society that we are and the society that we want to live in.

‘The fact that the Bill passed through both Houses undefeated is a huge accomplishment for the Government.

‘This is a historic moment that will resonate in many people's lives. I am proud that we have made it happen, and I look forward to the first same sex wedding by next summer.’

However the Catholic Bishops Conference of England and Wales said that the passing of the Act ‘marks a watershed in English law and heralds a profound social change’.

In a statement, conference president the Archbishop of Westminster the Most Rev Vincent Nichols and vice-president the Archbishop of Southwark Peter Smith said: ‘The new Act breaks the existing legal links between the institution of marriage and sexual complementarity.

‘With this new legislation, marriage has now become an institution in which openness to children, and with it the responsibility on fathers and mothers to remain together to care for children born into their family unit, are no longer central.

‘That is why we were opposed to this legislation on principle.’
