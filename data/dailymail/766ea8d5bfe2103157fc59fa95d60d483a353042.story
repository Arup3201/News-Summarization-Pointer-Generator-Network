Flashing a big smile on ITV’s This Morning earlier this week, Oxo mum and Loose Women star Lynda Bellingham demonstrated all her usual zest and warmth, despite undergoing gruelling chemotherapy for cancer.

But as well as her dazzling white teeth, the 65-year-old also showed off a dazzling halo of silver-white hair.

Fans quickly took to Twitter to congratulate the former chocolatey brunette on her new ‘silver vixen’ status.

Lynda’s been fortunate not to have lost her hair and it’s almost certainly white because women are advised to avoid dying it until six months after finishing chemo. This is because hair is more fragile and the scalp more sensitive during this time.

But even as I was applauding Lynda’s courage, I couldn’t help thinking that the moment she gets the go-ahead she’ll be back to her hairdresser faster than you can say ‘L’Oreal Rich Espresso’, demanding a return to her tinted natural self. If you’re wondering how you can possibly be both ‘tinted’ and ‘natural’, let me assure you that you can.

The hair colour a woman enjoys in her youth — whether brunette or blonde or auburn — is so often inextricably tied up with her identity. It is these shades that define who we are, not the grey that tries to colonise faster than Japanese knotweed.

Silver vixen: Lynda Bellingham this week

I discovered this for myself when I underwent a tortuous six-month experiment to grow out my roots after tinting my hair from the age of 27 until my mid-50s.

My visits to my colourist every three weeks had ruled my diary and depleted my bank balance for decades, and I had hoped going colour-free would free me — but my main realisation was that the ‘grey me’ was an ugly alien I didn’t recognise. The ‘real me’, the brunette, had walked away, leaving me bereft.

There was a moment, with my roots grown out to badger stripe stage, when for the first time in my life, a young man offered me his seat on the train. Grateful? I wanted to beat him around the head with my handbag. Instead I smiled and sat down, defeated.

The old cliché about grey-haired men looking distinguished while grey-haired women just look old is depressing, but the sad fact is that it’s as true today as ever.

When I cast my eyes across the roll-call of grey-haired female celebrities I find myself wishing that they would all do themselves a favour and reach for the tint.

Diane Keaton looks haggard, the formidable Anna Ford looks as though a wisp of wind would blow her away and Angela Rippon resembles a dowager — a shame given that she can still high-kick like a Tiller Girl.

Theresa May, with her blonde bits, grey fringe and variable roots merely looks confused, which for a Government minister doesn’t exactly inspire confidence. And while Jamie Lee Curtis’s crisp crop suits her, she could look less fearsome and more youthful with some highlights.

Meanwhile, the likes of George Clooney and David Ginola look even more devastatingly attractive with a sprinkling of silver.

By the age of 50, around half of all white women are likely to have grey hair

Admittedly, some men have wobbly moments when they first turn grey. When my partner of five years, Ronny, now 59, was in his early 40s and already more silver than average, he was tempted by a bottle of Grecian 2000 in Boots.

‘I suppose I just felt a bit too young to be grey,’ he explained. He waited until he went on holiday before trying it, knowing he wouldn’t bump into anyone he knew. ‘Actually the results were quite good,’ he says, ‘but I washed it out again as soon as possible because I really didn’t like the idea of anyone noticing it.’

Another man I know — tall, good-looking and close to 50 — admitted he was worried about grey around his temples.

Despite being the boss of a team of computer programmers, he was about 20 years older than most of his staff and felt he must look like an old man in their presence.

But at no point did he question the effect his hair would have on his success on the dating scene. As a newly-divorced man, he was as confident as he ever was with his dark locks.

So while grey hair can be an issue for today’s metrosexual men, and hairdressers report that growing numbers of men are dyeing their hair, it hardly seems to worry most.

This probably has to do with the fact that men remain fertile for longer — when a woman goes grey it signals the end of her fecundity, while it doesn’t have to for men — and men are programmed to seek out those who are able to reproduce. Add in the cultural pressures on women to stay young and beautiful, and grey-haired women are playing a losing game.

Battling the signs of aging: Linda Kelsey fighting the grey

As a feminist I feel I should be waving banners for the glad-to-be-grey sisterhood, but I’m not sure I’d find many sisters to join me. The home hair-colouring market was worth £350 million in 2013 say researchers Mintel, with about half of products used by the 40-60 age group — a spend 4.5 per cent up on 2012.

When, five years ago, I started my experiment to grow out my roots, friends thought I was nuts.

This was especially so because it came within a year of separating from my husband and only weeks after having embarked on a new relationship with someone who took me on as a brunette.

But given that Ronny, my new man, was himself grey-haired, I thought it might prove a good test of what he really thought of me. As it turned out, he was patient and tried to be complimentary. He also breathed a big sigh of relief when I went back on the bottle — of tint, that is.

What did I learn from this torture, apart from the fact that time and money could be saved? That unless you have thick, bouncy hair (mine is fine and as bouncy as lead), you’ll look a great many years older than you did before.

That unless your hair grows close to white, hair the colour of scaffolding will make your features look grey as well.

That if you don’t have masses of confidence in your looks, grey hair will make you feel invisible.

It’s one of the injustices between the sexes that a woman’s chances of meeting someone will be diminished if she presents herself as grey, bad news for the increasing number of over-50s who’ve turned to online dating. One 50-something acquaintance, already grey-haired, posted her profile and got scant response. When she dyed her hair and posted a new picture, the response rate went right up. Soon she was dating a handsome grey-haired man.

There are a number of women, following chemotherapy, who are so grateful to be still alive, and to see their hair growing back at all, that they wear their grey locks almost as a badge of victory.

But I know plenty who find that dyeing their hair again gives them a boost of confidence. And that’s why I’m betting that Lynda Bellingham will be a re-minted brunette in the very near future.

As for me, the tyranny of the tint seems a small price to pay for feeling better about myself. Which is why I intend to keep on dyeing until the day I die.
