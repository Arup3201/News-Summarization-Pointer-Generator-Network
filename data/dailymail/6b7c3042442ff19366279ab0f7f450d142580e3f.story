An American shark expert is on the hunt for a 11 metre great white shark off New Zealand's South Island

The shark fanatic and his team of thrill-seeking investigators teamed up with the Discovery Channel to uncover the truth behind the legendary 11 metre shark, which prowls off New Zealand's coast.

While Stewart Island is a hive of activity for sharks, Jeff was on the hunt for the mega-specimen and took to diving in the dark to view the creatures at their most active time.  

Speaking to The New Zealand Herald, Jeff said it was one of the most full-on shark diving experiences he's ever had and believes New Zealand is one of the most populated areas for great white sharks in the world.

'These things are just coming out of the darkness and they're super-big ... there were quite a number of sharks there and they were all go,' he said.

However, experts believe the fabled 11 metre shark is just a legend as no formal sightings of the monster have been recorded.

The renewed interest in New Zealand's shark community is at an all-time high due to the death of Adam Strange in a great white attack in Muriwai last February.

It was the first shark attack in New Zealand since 1976.  

In the exhilarating footage, the sharks can be seen repeatedly ramming the cage, moving it across the sea floor and taunting the divers.

Within minutes, the shark had spotted the men in the cage and made his move. 

Ramming into the cage with his wide mouth, the shark managed to make his way in through the entrance. 

However he backs away shortly after and the door is swiftly shut closed with Jeff and the divers proclaiming that it's too risky.

Jeff said he spoke to the fishermen in the local area, with many of them recounting experiences they have had with the mammoth great white sharks

One fisherman told the diver that he had witnessed a 30 foot long shark off the island.  

Jeff, who has been part of the Discovery Channel show Shark Week series since 1991 told the newspaper that his experience in New Zealand was 'quite spectacular'.

'I think the sharks we saw in New Zealand were probably the largest sharks I've ever seen in 25 years of Shark Week," he said. 

Explaining the moment the team came across a shark that measured between 6 and 7 metres, Jeff said it was 'just a majestic animal'.

While the team didn't find any sharks as big at the 11 metre legend, Jeff believes they came close.

He also marvelled at the fact that not much research has been done off the coast of the remote New Zealand Island, which is a hub of activity for great white sharks.

While he believes there is so much more he has to learn about the beautiful creatures, Kurr and his team managed to attach a 'fin cam' to a shark's dorsal fin.

They captured sharks socialising with each other and came to the conclusion that they are not the solitary killers they are made out to be.

Lair of the Mega Shark kick-starts Shark Week at 8.30pm on December 1 on the Discovery Channel.
