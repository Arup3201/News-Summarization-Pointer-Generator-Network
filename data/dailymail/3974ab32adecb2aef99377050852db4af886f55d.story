This shocking photograph shows how a defenceless elderly woman was left with multiple head injuries after she was brutally beaten over the head with a doorstop in her own home.

Retired English teacher Jean Taylor, 76, was left covered in blood after the prolonged assault by the thug who ransacked her home in Bristol and stole £100.

Miss Taylor had a polite conversation with the attacker for several minutes on her doorstep before he forced his way into her home and hit her over the head with the cat-shaped, pottery doorstop.

Doorstop: She was hit over the head with pottery cat which would have looked similar to this

Then, as she lay in agony on the floor, he began to throw rubbish at her.

Mrs Taylor - who uses a walking stick to get around - required sitches and glue in the aftermath of the attack.

She has been left traumatised by the horrifying encounter and  is still receiving treatment for bruised ribs and hands

The grammar school teacher of 40 years described the attacker as 'pure evil' and said: 'It was mid-afternoon when he rang the bell. He looked quite pleasant and he was to begin with.

'He was just making conversation about general things and talking about people moving in and out of the street.

'He said something about a cat. I said "my cat’s upstairs in bed" and when I turned away he pushed me on the floor. I thought I was going to die, I really did.

'I think he hit me with my door stop - a pottery cat - because it was something very hard and it’s not in the house any more.

'He just kept hitting me and I
 thought he was going to break my skull. I just didn’t know why he did 
it - it was awful. If you had seen his face it was pure evil.

'Then he started making a mess, throwing rubbish at me. It was like a disaster area.

Scene: The brutal assault happened at the elderly woman's home in the Green Street area of Bristol

Plea: Kerry McCarthy, the Labour MP for Bristol East has asked her followers to help find the intruder responsible for the vicious attack

'He
 opened up my handbag and took the wallet out, which had my cards in it.
 I’d got money out earlier that day too - there was over £100 in there.

'It all went quiet and I thought he must’ve gone upstairs, but then I realised he had left the house.'

Police have decided to release the image of her looking petrified and covered in blood in a bid to catch the man responsible.

Investigator Paul Hopes said: 'This was a vicious and prolonged assault on an elderly lady in her own home.

'The incident has left her traumatised and she is undergoing treatment for the injuries to her head.

Injuries: The elderly woman was restrained by a man at her home while a female searched her home in Rotherham

A 92-year-old woman has been subjected to a 'terrifying ordeal' by intruders who posed as police and held her down while they robbed her home.

South Yorkshire Police have issued photographs of the injuries sustained by the pensioner when she was restrained by a man who robbed her at her home in Rotherham along with a woman accomplice.

A spokesman said that after pushing the pensioner into her flat, the man held the elderly woman, causing extensive injuries to her arms, while the female accomplice searched the property.

Approximately £400 in cash was stolen before the pair left the scene, officers said.

Detective said the pair believed to be responsible are in their 50s.

They went to the elderly woman's home on Saturday telling the householders they were from the police.

Detective Inspector Steve Ashmore said: 'This was a terrifying ordeal for an elderly member of the community and we're providing all relevant support to the woman.

'It appears to be an isolated incident but that's no consolation to the victim who sustained significant bruising to her arms.

'To trick your way into someone's home is devious and calculated but then to restrain a pensioner and take cash from her purse is a despicable act.'
