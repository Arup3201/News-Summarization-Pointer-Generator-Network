One runs London, the other runs England’s schools.

But as Boris Johnson and Michael Gove emerged from a restaurant on a night out, there was only one top Tory fans wanted to be photographed with.

As the pair emerged from an exclusive Mayfair eatery, Mr Johnson was mobbed by autograph hunters while Mr Gove looked on.

As most of London was celebrating the news of the royal birth, the two senior Conservatives were on a night out at Scott’s restaurant.

Mr Johnson hinted at his plan to have a drink when he congratulated Kate and William on the borth of their son.

He said: 'Huge congratulations to the Duke and Duchess on the birth of their first child who will, by virtue of being born in this great city, be a Londoner through and through.

'I am sure millions of Londoners will be raising a glass today to toast this wonderful news.'

Several hours later he was seen emerging from Scott's with his trademark rucksack before heading off in search of his Marin bicycle, struggling to click his helmet on as he prepared to ride off.

Both men appeared to be suffering from the heat, with Mr Gove’s tie loosened around the neck and Mr Johnson’s shirt unbuttoned in an attempt to stay cool.

But as they tried to head off into the night, Mr Johnson’s celebrity status stopped them in their tracks.

He was mobbed by tourists who ran down the road to meet the London Major.

They took it in turns to hug and shake Mr Johnson by the hand, while posing for pictures taken on camera phones.

Slightly awkwardly, Mr Gove does not appear to have been recognised and stood nearby looking on.

A recent poll suggested Mr Johnson was the second most well-known politician, with 91 per cent of people correctly naming him.

Only David Cameron has a higher recognition rate at 94 per cent, according to Lord Ashcroft’s survey.

Education Secretary Mr Gove is seen as one of the big stars of the coalition, pushing through major reforms of schools.

But just 35 per cent said they recognised him and only 29 per cent of people correctly identified him.

He was most often mixed him up with UKIP leader Nigel Farage and John Gummer, a minister in John Major’s government.
