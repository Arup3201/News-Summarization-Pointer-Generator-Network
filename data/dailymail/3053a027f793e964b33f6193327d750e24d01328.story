Manchester United can return Radamel Falcao to his parent club Monaco if he gets a recurrence of the knee injury that ruled him out for much of last season.

The Colombian striker moved to Old Trafford on a £6million loan deal this transfer deadline day, and is earning almost £300,000-per-week. 

But United have sought to make sure this investment isn't wasted, ensuring a clause in the deal that allows them to terminate the loan if his injury returns.

The Colombian striker Falcao cost £6million for his season-long loan deal, and earns around £280,000 a week

Falcao scored just 11 times for Monaco in his season at the club, suffering a terrible knee injury

There have been doubts about whether the Colombian can ever recover his best form after the injury

The club tested their new striker rigorously during his deadline day medical, and although they were satisfied with the results, the club felt the need to add in the clause for extra protection. 

Falcao missed this summer's World Cup after tearing his anterior cruciate ligament playing for Monaco in January. 

The 28-year-old made his United debut off the bench against QPR last weekend, and could start for his new club for the first time at Leicester on Sunday.
