She's known as the Imelda Marcos of British politics with a shoe obsession that has seen her attend functions wearing everything from sparkling gold wellies to leopard print kitten heels.

Yesterday, however, the Home Secretary, 58, put her best foot forward in a  brave choice for a very formal occasion - a pair of black patent leather, leopard-print over-the-knee boots.

Joining the Queen, the Prime Minister and other dignitaries at the Horse Guards Parade in central London  to welcome Mexico's President Enrique Pena Nieto and his wife Angelica Rivera, Mrs May strode forth in the flamboyant footwear, even managing to perform a neat curtsy in said boots to greet Her Majesty.

There was no optical illusion to the bright overcoat that the MP for Maidenhead was wearing either. The colourful red and gold number, which Mrs May has showcased before, more than matched the thigh-high boots for glamour.

A 41-gun salute, fired by the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery sounded as President Nieto and his wife arrived with the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall.

On a particularly inclement day, perhaps the boots were as much about warmth as they were about fashion. It's also not the first time they've been seen; Mrs May donned the same pair - or something very similar - for another ceremonial greeting back in 2013 when the President of South Korea, Park Geun-Hye arrived for an official visit.

The MP is famously unapologetic about her fancy footwear, having described her sometimes maverick choices as a conversation starter. She once said: ‘I have no regrets (about being famous for my shoes). The good thing is that they are often an icebreaker.' 

The Conservative MP famously sported a pair of leopard-print kitten heels at the Conservatives’ annual party conference back in 2002...and the eye-catching footwear has kept coming ever since.

Dowdy? Even more leopard-print, although this time in a much flatter form...Mrs May went for comfort at the Conservative Party's annual Spring Forum in 2013

Just last month a supporter at the Conservative fundraising Black and White Ball splashed out a cool £17,500 to go on a shoe-shopping mission with Mrs May.

And the Home Secretary even suggested once that her shoe-style had encouraged a young supporter to venture into politics: 'I was in the Commons recently and saw a young lady wearing a nice pair of shoes.

'I said I liked them and she said my shoes were the reason she became involved in politics.' 

Although the Queen appeared unruffled by the Home Secretary's sartorial choices, fashion industry commentators were quick to question the biker chic look.

Fashion Writer Simon Glazin questioned the appropriateness of the shoes for such a formal occasion: 'Wearing a pair of boots like this for a night at your friend's house is fine but I'd certainly question the choice when you're heading to a meeting with the Mexican President and shaking hands with the Queen. They looked uncomfortable to curtsy in.'

A passion for red after all? Wearing a rather risque outfit at the Dorchester Hotel back in 2010

'It's the high-shine patent that is particularly unflattering. It can look, dare I say it, a bit cheap. They don't really go with that coat and gloves either, which are actually very chic.' 

Although it's unclear where Mrs May might have bought the boots from, shoe retailer Russell and Bromley have a strikingly similar pair of 'glossy black croc print patent leather' costing a not insubstantial £465 a pair. 

The brand describes the boot as easy to wear 'with black skinnies for understated glamour by day or dress up with tailored dresses for a cool twist on evening dressing.'
