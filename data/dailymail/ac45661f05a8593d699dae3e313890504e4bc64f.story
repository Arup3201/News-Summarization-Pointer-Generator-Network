Liverpool midfielder Jordan Lussey has joined Championship side Bolton for the remainder of the season.

The 20-year-old will look for regular competitive action for Neil Lennon's side in the remaining seven games  with Bolton, who are currently 17th in the Championship, just 10 points from the relegations zone.

Lussey has been a regular for the Liverpool Under 21 side, having joined the Reds in 2002, and travelled with Brendan Rodgers' Europa League squad to face Besiktas last month.

Lussey tweeted his joy on Thursday: 'Delighted to have joined Bolton on loan, thanks for all the messages!'

The box-to-box midfielder has also represented England at youth level and will provide competition for places in Lennon's side, who next face Blackpool on April 4.

He follows the likes of Liverpool team-mates Sheyi Ojo and Jerome Sinclair, who have both joined relegation-threatened Championship side Wigan on loan in the last six weeks to gain first-team football experience.
