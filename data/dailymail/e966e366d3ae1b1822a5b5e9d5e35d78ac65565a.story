A pair of benefit cheats swindled more than £42,000 from the taxpayer - despite having won £250,000 on the lottery.

Alfred Wells, 64, and his partner Patricia Marshall, 55, from West Boldon, South Tyneside, claimed pension credit, housing benefit and council tax for five years - even though they had more than £170,000 savings stashed away.

Wells had won £250,000 on the lottery in 2008 and also received a lump sum of £38,000 when he retired from his job at South Tyneside Council.

Guilty: Alfred Wells and Patricia Marshall, photographed outside Newcastle Crown Court, pleaded guilty to benefit fraud after swindling more than £42,000 by lying about their savings

But the couple, who had no previous convictions, claimed they only had between £700 and £800 of savings - so they could claim more than £42,000 in benefits.

When they were arrested last year, Wells said: 'All I am saying is hands up, I have been caught. I have been an idiot, a fraudster, whatever you are going to call it.'

At a hearing at Newcastle Crown Court, Wells pleaded guilty to two counts of benefit fraud. Marshall pleaded guilty to three counts of the same charge.

They were both sentenced to eight months in prison, suspended for two years. All the money which the couple wrongly claimed has been repaid.

The court heard that, between July 13, 2009 and May 26, 2013, the couple wrongly claimed £41,638 in benefits.

Marshall also claimed £591 in housing benefit and council tax benefit between September 20, 2008 and December 22, 2008.

She did this by claiming she was living as a single person, even though she lived with Wells.

Wells had won £250,000 on the lottery in 2008 and had also received a £38,000 lump sum on his retirement - but still falsely claimed the benefits

Lee Fish, prosecuting, said: 'Alfred Wells claimed pension credit between July 13, 2009 and May 26, 2013 for both himself and his partner on the basis they were both over 60, had no real income and they had savings below the allowable limit.

'As a result of that claim he was also able to claim housing benefit and council tax benefit.

'The claim was made by Mr Wells, however Patricia Marshall participated in the telephone call which give rise to the claim for benefit. Therefore these claims were effectively made for both of their benefits.

'During their telephone call made to claim benefits they declared they only had £700 to £800 worth of savings.

'They had £171,000 at there disposal. This money came to be in the couple's possession in 2008.

'Alfred
 Wells actually won the lottery, he won quarter of a million pounds. 
Further in 2009 he received a lump sum of £38,000 when he retired from 
work.

When Wells was arrested in August last year, he said: 'All I am saying is hands up, I have been caught. I have been an idiot, a fraudster'

'Both defendants were interviewed on August 1 last year and in interview accepted that they had made these applications for benefits out of sheer greed.

'He (Wells) accepted that what he had done was thoroughly dishonest.'

Defending, Jonathan Cousins told the court how Wells was unwell. He said the defendant was currently in remission after being diagnosed with throat cancer in 2010.

Mr Cousins said: 'Mr Wells rues the day he won the lottery, it has brought him a number of problems.

'He has never claimed any benefit whatsoever until he won the lottery. That is also the case for Miss Marshall.

'When he won the money he gave a significant proportion of it to charity, a significant proportion of it to his family and invested a large amount of it in an investment.

'He lived off the remainder. They both lived together and they had no other money.

'What they both did was claim benefits and they both deeply regret that. They recognise that it was wrong and they are thoroughly remorseful.

'The money has been repaid, that includes the cost of the investigation and the benefits they claimed.

'I think it's unlikely that you will see either defendant before the criminal courts ever again.'

Judge Debbie Sherwin told Wells and Marshall: 'It is a sad day when two people who have never been in trouble in the court before find themselves before the court for serious offences.

'You came into a large sum of money and also received another payment at the same time.

'Some of that money was given to family and charity and some was invested. That was the part that should have been declared. You said you just got greedy.'

Judge Sherwin also gave each defendant 100 hours of unpaid work and ordered them to pay £170 prosecution costs.
