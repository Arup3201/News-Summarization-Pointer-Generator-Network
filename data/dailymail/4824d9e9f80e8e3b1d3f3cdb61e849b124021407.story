Many sport stars say they will do whatever it takes to succeed.

But tennis player Simona Halep has gone to drastic measures in her bid to win Wimbledon – by having a breast reduction to improve her reaction times.

And since going from a 34DD to a 34C aged 17, she has soared up the rankings – and is now seeded number three for Wimbledon, ahead of former champion Maria Sharapova.

As one commentator explained: ‘She is more confident, more mobile and her strokes are less restricted now that those obstacles have been reduced.’

The 22-year-old Romanian reached the fourth round at last year’s US Open and the quarterfinals at the Australian Open in January, before making it to the French Open final a few weeks ago.

Her recently appointed coach Wim Fissette said her breast reduction had been 'an important part of her career.'

At the time of her operation, Miss Halep, pictured before surgery said of her breasts: 'I don't like them in my everyday life, either. I would have gone for surgery even if I hadn't been a sportswoman'

She added: 'I guess it was the right decision. I did not see her then. I have seen some photos, but she took that decision and it was a good one. I understand that. 

'That’s why she was famous.

'Let’s hope she will win a Grand Slam and then they will start talking about the Grand Slams and not something else.’

She said last week: 'A few years ago I was looking up the rankings on the internet and I saw I was on the fourth page. I said my dream was to be on the first page.

'Now I am there. I want to enjoy this moment but I want to improve more in my game and maybe be second or first.'
