Courageous: Medic Hannah Cook of Devon was caught in two blasts in her first week on the frontline

A female Royal Navy medic hit by two bomb blasts in her first week is back on the frontline after insisting on being allowed to return to Afghanistan.

Hannah Cook suffered serious injuries, including deafness and deep shrapnel wounds, after being caught in an IED blast on routine patrol just days into her first tour in in Nahr-e Sarraj South.

The 22-year-old, from Lympstone, Devon, had already saved the life of a comrade who lost a leg earlier in the week following a similar blast whilst part of a similar sortie in the troubled Helmand Province.

But just three months after both explosions, which left her suffering severe shock, MA Cook has flown back into the warzone because she was so desperate to rejoin her comrades.

Speaking from Afghanistan, Hannah told how returning to frontline action - where she continues to patrol some of the most dangerous hot spots - has seen her accepted by comrades.

She said: ‘As a female, you feel you have to prove yourself and show you're not going to fail them in patrols.

‘But once they know you just get on with it, they accept you. After that incident, they respected me straight away.           

‘It sounds horrible and of course you do not want anyone to be injured - but it's good to put it into practice.’

MA Cook added: ‘You can be the best or the worst soldier, but it does not matter with IEDs. It is a game of chance.

‘I was not at all put off by what happened. I am here to do a job; if there are consequences, you deal with them.’

She rushed forward to stem the flow of blood gushing from his wounds - which probably saved his life - despite the threat of gunfire and other potential IED's.

The explosion, just 15 minutes away from their destination, caused the soldier to lose one of his legs, but amazingly escape with his life.

MA Cook said: ‘I saw the whole explosion but because of the dust cloud, I couldn't see what was going on. I was about seven men behind but when there was a call for a medic, I ran the fastest I have ever run.

‘It sounds cliché, but the training really did kick in. It felt good to put my medical skills into use so early on. I was holding his hand, telling him he was ok and I felt I was making a difference.’

Days later, while on another routine foot patrol, she was caught in a second blast, this time causing her extensive injuries including deafness and lacerations.

‘I was not at all put off by what happened. I am here to do a job; if there are consequences, you deal with them’

‘I remember the whole incident,’ she added.

‘I saw I was bleeding and remember hoping all my limbs were still there. I saw both my legs and both my arms and I was so relieved.’

The blast, triggered during a routine patrol, caused serious shrapnel wounds to two other servicemen, one of which was saved but will not return to Afghanistan.

The other returned to action after undergoing treatment but later sustained a gunshot wound in a separate incident and is still being treated.

MA Cook said: ‘As soon as I was injured, I wasn't able to provide any treatment myself. There was nothing I could give to the situation.

‘But I kept saying I wanted to treat them. I was in shock and the lads were having to tell me I was not in the right state to help.

‘I feel so lucky about the injuries I sustained. It could have been a lot worse.

‘I saw I was bleeding and remember 
hoping all my limbs were still there. I saw both my legs and both my 
arms and I was so relieved'

‘It was strange for me to be a casualty, but everyone who dealt with me was absolutely brilliant, from start to finish.

‘What this sort of incident does is make you realise how vulnerable you are. As a medic, you don't think you're the one that's going to be injured. It puts everything into perspective.’

Lieutenant Jay O'Malley, second in charge (2IC) of A squadron close support medical group, praised her bravery, adding: ‘She was blown up twice in her first week and dealt with massive trauma.

‘She did not have to come back out, but she wanted to. You cannot ask any more of someone than that.’
