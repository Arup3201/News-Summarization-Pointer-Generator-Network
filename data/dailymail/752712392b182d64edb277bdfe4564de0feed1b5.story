A former business teacher is suing the school which fired her after students allegedly stole nude selfies from her cell phone and posted them online.

Lekeshia Jones, 34, was sacked from Myers Middle School in Savannah, Georgia last week for being 'insubordinate' and irresponsible with her phone.

However Jones said she was wrongfully fired and the only mistake she made was trusting her 14-year-old students to respect her privacy.

'I feel like I was the victim, like I had been violated,' Jones told  WTOC-TV.

Angry: Georgia business teacher Lekeshia Jones, 34, is suing her local school board and a group of 14-year-old students who she says hacked into her cell phone and stole her naked selfies before posting them online

Savannah Now reported the Savannah-Chatham school board voted to terminate Jones on Wednesday last week for the drama which ensued after she left her phone unattended in February.

Jones had given her cell phone password to students so they could call home after school.

When she left the phone on her desk in the class room, students looked through it and photographed three of her naked photos with their cell phones.

The pictures allegedly included Jones lying in bed naked and partially draped in a sheet, completely nude and a close up of female anatomy.

Myers Principal Ericka Washington said the students created a T.H.O.T. (That Ho Over There) Facebook page and online Kik Room where the racy snaps were shared.

Washington said Jones did not immediately report the incidents, and instead launched her own investigation when she found out about the photos in March.

District 
officials moved to sack Jones when she was reassigned her to another 
middle school and failed to attend for three weeks.

The board claimed Jones was insubordinate when she didn’t show up for work and irresponsible in the way she handled her cell phone.

'She
 gave her password to the kids and they somehow got on it and when she 
found out she didn’t report it but had the kids send pictures back to 
her,' school board attorney Leamon Holliday said.

'Those
 pictures shouldn’t have been in the classroom in the first place. 
Policy clearly says if you take a cell phone to school, it’s your 
responsibility to take care of it.'

Jones, however, maintains that she did nothing wrong and is being mistreated.

'Whatever is in my phone is my business,' Jones told WTOC. 'There is nothing in the policy about what you can or cannot have in your phone.'

Jones said she filed a wrongful termination suit against the school board and also plans to press charges against the teens who hacked into her phone.WTOC-TV: Savannah, Beaufort, SC, News, Weather
