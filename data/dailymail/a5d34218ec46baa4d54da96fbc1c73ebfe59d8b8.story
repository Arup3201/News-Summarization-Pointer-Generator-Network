Oliver Cheshire returns for another season as the very stylish face of M&S Best Of British menswear.

The London-born model, 25, shows off his razor sharp cheekbones in a new set of spring/summer pictures for the high street retailer.

Smartly clad in check suits, thick-framed specs and oversized bow ties, Cheshire gives off an air of banker meets handsome professor in the new campaign.

The bow tie, traditionally worn to events, has increasingly extended to daywear wardrobes recently but less formal styles are also flying off the shelves at 
M&S this Spring, say representatives.

And In the latest offering for menswear the M&S Best Of British line teams bow ties with suits in Prince of Wales and Window Pane Check and as well as Navy Wool.

The menswear collection is based on a fresh 
spring colour palette in lighter weighted fabrics.

Attention
 to detail is integral to the collection, and bow ties, ties and 
Harringtons have been designed in suiting fabric to create the ultimate 
in refined sartorial statements for men.

M&S hope to form a new-look masculine mood for spring. Much like last season, prices go up to £799 for a suit, with the average shirt around £99 and £29.50 for ties.

M&S said of Best Of British: 
'The collections combine our rich heritage with modern 
styling to create an edit of timeless pieces with an emphasis on true 
British craftsmanship and quality.

'All
 garments are made in Britain in a selection of premium fabrics 
including luxury Scottish cashmere through to fine Yorkshire cloths and 
each piece is finished to the highest level of detail, a standard 
synonymous with British design.'

Oliver, who has enjoyed a sparkling modelling career of some ten years, was scouted by Select Model Management at just 15 while studying drama and became an overnight success.

'From high fashion to high street fashion, everyone gets Oliver’s look,' said Tandy Anderson, founder of Select Model Management, in May.

'Like a young DiCaprio at the start of his career, in front of the camera he has a real versatility and appeal - he's the new everyman of modelling, he is genuinely a face to watch out for.'

Away from the modelling scene, Oliver is dating 23-year-old singer Pixie Lott and the pair were spotted leaving a central London restaurant together on Valentine's Day.

He looked dapper in a stylish black suit with a crisp white shirt and skinny black tie as Pixie carried an aptly heart-shaped handbag.

Ever the gentleman, Oliver carried a large black umbrella to protect his pretty girlfriend from the heavy downpour of rain.
