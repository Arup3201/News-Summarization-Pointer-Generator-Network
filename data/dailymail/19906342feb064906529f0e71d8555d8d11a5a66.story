A Maine family has been devastated by the sudden death of 17-year-old Kelsey Stoneton, who collapsed on Friday after suffering a pulmonary embolism.

The academically gifted Winthrop High School junior was also an accomplished field hockey player and her father, Joel Stoneton, the school's athletic director, said his daughter had 'everything going for her.'

Captain of the hockey team, Kelsey passed away on Saturday morning after suffering a blood clot in her lungs and her mother, Kimberly, said that while she is distraught, 'I like to think she chose not to wake up again because she chose to stay where she is, it must be a far greater place than here.'

Kelsey has left behind her parents and a younger sister, Haley, and the family have asked for flowers, gifts and notes to be left outside Joel's home in Withthrop.

The porch has become a makeshift shrine to the teen, who passed away at Maine Medical Center in Portland after a fatal clot burst and caused her to collapse and pass away.

Pulmonary embolism's are sudden and often come on without warning, leaving the sufferer racing against time to get medical attention.

'She meant everything to us,' said said Joel to The Portland Press Herald.

'She was always smiling, always smiling, and she brought that to our family.

'I’m not just saying that because she was my daughter, too. She was such a happy girl, a joy to be around all the time.

'She’s going to be missed.'

Kelsey's friend, Kate Boyman, took to Twitter to express her grief at her friend passing.

Describing the weekend as like 'living in a nightmare', Boyman said that she is simply struggling to cope and feel 'extremely sorry for those who didn't get to know her.'

Kelsey's little sister, Haley, posted a heart felt message on Facebook on Saturday.

'We just lost the most amazing girl I have ever met. She was strong, bright, amazing at field hockey, beautiful,' wrote Haley. 

Prayers: Members of the local community attend a vigil for Kelsey outside the home of Joel Stoneton over the weekend just passed

'And just over all an amazing sister. She was the nicest person I have ever met. And life with out her is going to be hard. But I love you with all my heart Kelsey Ann Stoneton.

'You are the best sister I could ever ask for and no one is going to replace you.'

Joel used Twitter to implore parents to hug their children and for kids to hug their parents because you never know what could happen.

'Thank you for the growing amount of flowers, pictures, candles etc on the front deck/steps,' wrote Joel.

'It is a huge confirmation of what we all already knew, that Kels is nothing but a true ray of sun shine and can never be replaced.

'Anyone please feel free to put something there and understand why we may not come out.....we are all trying to understand why she's gone.'
