At just two-years-old, a California boy called Tegan has made a name for himself online thanks to a series on videos showing him busting out some incredible dub step dance moves.

But the clips have also raised some eyebrows as to whether they are authentic, amid questions they may have been doctored to seem more impressive than they are.

Not so, says the creators of the YouTube videos, one of whom is Lino Morin, the father of Tegan and a dancer himself.

Busting out: Despite some questions over Tegan's dancing, the creators of the video said they are authentic

Tegan, of Grass Velley, in northeast of Sacramento, appears in more than 10 of the group's videos, which are filmed around their neighborhood.

His father and another man, Vincent Pezzi, are the other two dancers.

They perform under the name ProFlo.

The first video of Tegan appeared online on October 3.

'Anyone (doesn't believe they are real) can just look on YouTube,'  Pezzi told The Daily Mail Online.

'We have alot more videos. There's one titled Prodigy and others where we dance as a group.'

Pezzi invited any skeptics to come along and watch the trio dance.

A video uploaded in December then hit back at what appeared to be detractors who called out some of the moves as fake.

'No Photoshop. We Do This,' was the title of one video, which showed Tegan dancing in the rain.

Tegan dances alongside his father in many of the clips.

Tegan's most popular clip features him dancing to to Adventure Club's remix of 'Crave You' by Flight Facilities.

That video has been viewed near four million times.

It was filmed dancing outside his home in northern California. 

Calls for comment to reach the creators of ProFlo by The Daily Mail were not immediately returned.
