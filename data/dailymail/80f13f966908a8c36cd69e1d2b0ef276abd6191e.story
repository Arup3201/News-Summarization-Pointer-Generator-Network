Next time a relative tells you they can't use a touchscreen, show them this video of a tortoise mastering the skill with ease. 

Researchers trained four red-footed tortoises to use a touchscreen in return for strawberries and other treats. 

The animals were able to identify between red triangles and blue dots on the display, and even learnt which side of the screen to press.

The tortoises were trained to use the touchscreen by researchers from the University of Lincoln. They began by teaching the animals basic touchscreen functions, using their noses. During the main experiment, the animals were trained to peck a red triangle in the centre of the touchscreen (pictured)

The animals also were able to transfer this knowledge to a real-life, offline experiment.

Each trial began by showing the tortoise a red triangle on a touchscreen. 

Once the triangle was touched, using the tortoise’s nose, it disappeared and two blue circles appeared.

If the circle on the designated side was chosen, both images disappeared and a reward was provided through an automatic feeder.

If the circle on the incorrect side was chosen the tortoise was given a three-second time out during which the screen remained empty. 

The trial was then repeated.

Each correction trial started with the red triangle.

The tortoise received correction trials until the correct choice was made. 

Professor Anna Wilkinson from the University of Lincoln led the study, alongside researchers from the University of Vienna.

The tortoises were called Esme, Quinn, Molly and Emily.

During the main experiment, the animals were trained to 'peck' a red triangle in the centre of the touchscreen.

When two blue circles flashed, they had to peck either the circle on the left, or the one on the right, to get a treat. 

The correct side was programmed into the machine.  

The touchscreen was placed in a rectangular box with white plastic walls and a floor covered with grey, rubber lining.

A feeder hole was positioned in the centre of the floor, just below the touchscreen.

Once the triangle was touched, using the tortoise’s nose, it disappeared and two blue circles appeared (pictured). If the circle on the designated side was chosen, both images disappeared and a strawberry was dropped through an automatic feeder

Pressing the correct circle resulted in the feeder plate turning, which caused a strawberry to drop into the feeder hole.

‘In recent years red-footed tortoises have been shown to be proficient in a number of spatial cognition tasks,’ explained the researchers.

‘The present study investigated the ability of the tortoise to learn a spatial task in which the response required was simply to touch a stimulus presented in a given position on a touchscreen.

‘The results show that red-footed tortoises are able to operate a touchscreen and can successfully solve a spatial two-choice task.’

The numbers on this chart reveal how many attempts the tortoise took to successfully complete each stage of the training. For example, during 10 sessions, Esme took 10 attempts to correctly press the triangle and the correct circle to receive a treat

The
 training is significant because red-footed tortoises (stock image 
pictured) don’t have a hippocampus - an area of the brain associated 
with learning, memory and spatial navigation. They instead use an area 
known as the medial cortex, which is associated with decision making in 
humans

The training is significant because red-footed tortoises don’t have a hippocampus, an area of the brain associated with learning, memory and spatial navigation, Wilkinson told Live Science.

They use an area known as the medial cortex, which is associated with decision making in humans.

In a second experiment, the two tortoises applied their knowledge to a real-life environment.

The researchers used two blue bowls and placed them in a similar position to the blue circles on the screen.

The tortoises went to the bowl on the same side as the circles they had previously been trained to touch.
