A model smothered her six-year-old son with a pillow before stabbing herself in the heart after becoming convinced her wealthy husband was going to leave her.

Eliza Kolodziej, 27, was found next to her son Alexandra by her husband Sebastian Kolodziej at their home in a wealthy suburb in Warsaw, Poland.

Friends and neighbours spoke of their shock after describing them as the 'perfect family living a fairytale life'.

'Perfect family': Polish model Eliza Kolodziej with her son Alexandra who she smothered with a pillow before stabbing herself to death at their Warsaw home

After holding a pillow over the sleeping 
boy’s head, Mrs Kolodziej went into the kitchen where she took a knife before returning to her 
dead son’s bedroom and stabbing herself.

She was a former model 
who graduated from Poland's elite Kozminski University, a business school in Warsaw considered to be the country's 
highest-rated private university.

Pictures on her Facebook page show her smiling into the camera or cuddling her son and images of the boy with her on a tropical holiday where he was playing under palms in a hotel pool.

One neighbour said: 'She was tall, beautiful and friendly, he was successful, rich and handsome, and their son was a happy, carefree boy who was very popular with other children.

'They were the perfect family living a fairytale life.'

Tragedy: Eliza Kolodziej was found next to her son by her husband whom she thought was about to leave her

It is understood that Eliza was suffering from depression and had started seeing a psychiatrist after becoming obsessed that her partner was about to leave her.

A family friend said: 'She had a rich man and was afraid that if he left her she would be left with nothing.

'In recent months, she hardly ever went out and stopped meeting friends. She was living in a gilded cage and couldn’t deal with it.'

A spokesman for the local prosecutors office said: 'Preliminary findings show that the woman suffocated her six-year-old son and then committed suicide.

'But we are continuing our investigations.'
