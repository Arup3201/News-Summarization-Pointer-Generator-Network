Nigel Farage vowed yesterday to weed out 'eccentric' candidates who have 'skeletons in their cupboards'.

The UKIP leader said everyone who wanted to stand as an MP or an MEP would have to sign a charter to prove they are not extremists.

He made his pledge amid a row over a stand-up comedian making a series of jokes about foreigners and Muslims at a gala dinner after the party's spring conference last week.

Mr Farage refused to apologise for the jokes, saying it was wrong to 'censor' humour.

All potential candidates now have to fill in a form, where they have to declare that they have 'never engaged in, advocated or condoned racist, violent, criminal or anti-democratic activity'.

Other stipulations include: 'I have never been a member of or had links with any organisation, group or association which the national executive committee considers is liable to bring the party into disrepute'.

'I have never been convicted of any offence punishable by a custodial sentence, whether or not a custodial sentence was actually imposed. I shall notify the Party Chairman and General Secretary immediately upon being interviewed under caution', and 'Are you or have you ever been a member of the BNP, EDL or any other organisation that might be of public interest?'

Candidates also have to tick the following box: 'I do not have any â€œskeletons in my cupboardâ€
