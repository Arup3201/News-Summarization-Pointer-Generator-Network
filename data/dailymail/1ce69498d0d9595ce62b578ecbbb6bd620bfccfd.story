A stage 4 cancer sufferer has written a powerful op-ed explaining that as a direct result of Obamacare she has lost her life-saving medical insurance and the team that has kept her alive.

Edie Littlefield Sundby, who has been battling gallbladder cancer since 2007, explained in a piece for the Wall Street Journal that she is 'one of the losers' in the president's signature healthcare plan.

'I am a determined fighter and extremely
lucky,' she writes. 'But this luck may have just run out: My 
affordable, lifesaving medical insurance policy has been canceled 
effective December 31.'

Since learning that her plan with United Healthcare PPO will end within weeks, she has been scrambling to find out the alternatives for her care, she writes.

Battle: Cancer sufferer Edie Sundby (pictured with her husband Dale) says she is 'one of the losers' from Obamacare as she has lost her healthcare plan and now faces losing her doctors too

But she has learned that she must now either accept the government exchange plan and lose her world-class doctors or pay more for private insurance with an unfamiliar company.

It means that after fighting the cancer, which has a five-year survival rate of just two per cent, for nearly seven years, she faces the prospect of losing her team of primary doctors and oncologists, who have been crucial to saving her life.

She explains that her insurance company has paid $1.2 
million for her treatment and has never doubted her doctors, but now it is 
pulling out of the individual California market.

There is no one health-exchange plan accepted by both of the medical centers she has come to rely on; it means she needs to
choose between either keeping her primary oncologist at Stanford 
University or her primary care doctors at the University of California, 
San Diego.

Few options: Sundby (taking part in an 800-mile walk after she was previously cancer-free) must either accept the government plan and lose her doctors or pay more with an unfamilar insurance company

World-class care: University of California, San Diego (pictured), where her primary care doctors are based, does not accept the same exchange plan as Stanford University, where her primary oncologist is based

'My choice is to get coverage through the
government health exchange and lose access to my cancer doctors,' she 
writes, 'or pay much more for insurance outside the exchange (the quotes
average 40% to 50% more) for the privilege of starting over with an 
unfamiliar insurance company and impaired benefits.'

With
time running out, Sundby says that she and 
her broker 'still don't have a clue how to best proceed'.

She asks: 'What happened to the 
president's promise, "You can keep your health plan"? Or to the promise 
that "You can keep your doctor"?'

'Thanks
to the law, I have been forced to give up a world-class health plan. 
The exchange would force me to give up a world-class physician.'

She concludes that while taking away 
an individual's control over their medical coverage may be an effective 
way to manage costs, it makes it harder for them to stay alive.

'Broken promises': Obama has previously said that people will not lose their healthcare plans or their doctors - but Sundby said that is not the case for her and demands to know why

'Perhaps that's the point,' she writes.

While the piece appears aimed at President Obama, she writes that she only wants to stay alive, rather than made political points.

Her op-ed comes among increasing concerns that exchange plans following Obamacare will typically have narrow networks of physicians and hospitals.

It is just the latest criticism of the system; the enrollment process has also been plagued by software and data entry problems which led Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to offer an apology to a House committee in testimony.

Sebelius called the enrollment software problems a 'debacle' and 'a miserably frustrating experience for way too many Americans.'

President had promised that people were not going to lose their healthcare or their doctors - 'what happened to the president's promises?' she asks
