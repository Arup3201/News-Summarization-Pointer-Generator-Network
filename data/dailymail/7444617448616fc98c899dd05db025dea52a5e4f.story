House prices in Britain leaped up by as much as £7,430 last month, new figures reveal.

The average family home is up £5,583 and London properties have shot up by more than £7,000.

Experts claim the Help to Buy scheme has provoked a wave of new buyers, pushing prices up.

Soaring: The average London house price has broken the £400,000 barrier for the first time in history

The increase of £1,300 a week is the biggest jump in the market since 2010, according to leading real estate analyst Sequence (UK).

However, the change in October has not put off would-be homeowners as each house now has seven people fighting for it.

In London, where the average sale price is higher than ever, 14 people compete for every property.

It comes as the Council of Mortgage Lenders said last week the number of homes sold this year will be more than one million for the first time since the financial crisis began in 2007.

Rent prices: Letting prices are also up, with the average UK rent at £785 - 41 per cent of the average wage

There has been ‘a particularly severe contraction’ in the number of homes bought and sold in Britain, it said, nearly halving from 1.6million in 2007 to just 886,000 in 2010.

But the market has dramatically recovered, with more people keen to buy than at any time since the recession began.

Mortgage applications also rose by six per cent last month, and almost doubled in the past year.

David Plumtree, Sequence (UK) chief executive, said: 'The appetite to buy property across the UK has risen to record levels. This has impacted on property prices as competition for every new instruction intensifies.'

Richard Sexton, director of e.surv chartered surveyors, said: 'Help to Buy has opened a flood of new buyers, causing prices to surge upwards.'

Mortgages: Buy to Let mortgages have also rocketed this year, which has contributed to the price rise

Mortgage: Despite the increase in price, mortgage applications rose by six per cent in October

The government scheme, which launched in April, initially helped people to buy newly-built homes by offering a shared equity loan.

The average price of a property bought under the scheme was £194,167, with an average equity loan of £38,703.

Out of the 5,375 sold so far, the highest number of Help to Buy sales have been in Leeds, Wiltshire, Milton Keynes and Reading, according to the DCLG.

Critics warned the UK-wide second phase of the scheme, which began last month and is not restricted to new-builds, would cause a housing bubble.

It guarantees 15 per cent of the value of the home loan.

Driver: Experts claim the Help to Buy scheme, which entered its second phase last month, has opened a flood of buyers and driven up prices. The new phase is UK-wide and not restricted to newly-built homes

Climb: New buyer figures have moved up dramatically in the last month as people show no sign of holding off

Offers: Estate agents are now advising people how to submit secret bids as the number of offers per sale rise

In a bid to handle the 'inevitable' increase, estate agents have been advising desperate buyers on how to submit 'sealed bids'.

For the first time in its history, the National Association of Estate Agents last week published guidance about how sealed bids work and how to boost your chances of beating other buyers.

A sealed bid is when a buyer has so many people who want to buy their home - or wants to generate this level of interest - that they ask for secret bids to be submitted.

Renting: There has been a national rise in the number of new tenancies

Viewings: In London, there are fewer viewings per property now compared to October 2011

The highest bid does not necessarily get the property, as the buyer might also evaluate who is in the best position to buy the property.

That is, a cash bidder might beat a buyer who needs a mortgage, or needs to sell a property before being able to buy a new home.

Rent prices have also rocketed, with an annual increase of 11 per cent to £785 - 41 per cent of the average UK wage.
