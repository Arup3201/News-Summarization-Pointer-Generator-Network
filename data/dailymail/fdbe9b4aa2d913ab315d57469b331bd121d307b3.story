The founder of a popular punk clothing line has died after allegedly commuting suicide near Los Angeles' Laurel Canyon Park.

The body of Drew Bernstein, 51, was found Monday morning in a wooded area off Mulholland Drive.

LA County police say he died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the chest.

51-year-old fashion designer Drew 'Lippy' Bernstein's body was found Monday after an apparent suicide in a wooded area in Los Angeles

Bernstein, known as 'Lippy', founded the Gothic clothing line Lip Service in 1985.

The company had humble origins, and started with just Lippy and his business partner making screen prints in a garage.

But Lip Service went on to become a huge success, and Lippy was able to start several more clothing lines.

Bernstein's body was found Monday morning but wasn't identified by authorities until Tuesday

'Yesterday we lost out founder and dearest friend, Drew (aka Lippy),' the company wrote in a statement on their Facebook page.

'He was a good man who inspired everyone around him and there are not enough words to express how deeply he was loved and will be missed.

The body was found shortly before 9am on Monday, but officials didn't identify the body until Tuesday.
