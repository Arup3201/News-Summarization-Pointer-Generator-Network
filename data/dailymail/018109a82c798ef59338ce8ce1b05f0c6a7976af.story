After holders Manchester City were dumped out of the Capital One Cup on Wednesday, Manuel Pellegrini may not wish to be alerted to the League Cup-winning manager's curse that has developed since February 2007.

Between the 2007 and 2013 competitions, five out of the six managers to win the tournament  left their club less than a year later.

The Chilean boss should not be feeling the heat just five months after winning the Premier League, but the list of managers to have lost their jobs so soon after lifting the League Cup in recent years is a reminder of how quickly things can change in football.

2007-08: Juande Ramos – won cup with Tottenham in February 2008. Sacked in October 2008 (eight months later).

2009-10: Sir Alex Ferguson - won cup with Manchester United in February 2010. Remained in his job until May 2013

2010-11: Alex McLeish – won cup with Birmingham in February 2011. Resigned in June 2011 (four months later).

2011-12: Kenny Dalglish – won cup with Liverpool in February 2012. Sacked in May 2012 (3 months later).

2012-13: Michael Laudrup – won cup with Swansea on  Feb 24 2013. Sacked on  Feb 4 2014 (less than a year later).

2013-14: Manuel Pellegrini  – won cup with Manchester City in March 2014.

Back in February 2007, few could have foreseen that Jose Mourinho, who had just won the Carling Cup for the Premier League champions would be gone just seven months later. 

A year later, Juande Ramos lifted the trophy for Tottenham after a 2-1 win against Chelsea, which was meant to herald a bright new dawn for Spurs. Eight months on the Spaniard was unceremoniously given the boot after a run of poor results. 

Sir Alex Ferguson bucked the trend by winning the tournament in 2009 and 2010 and remaining in his post until 2013, but since then the curse has continued. 

In 2011, Birmingham defeated Arsenal in the final but suffered relegation from the Premier League just three months later. The following month, manager Alex McLeish resigned  via email.

Liverpool legend Kenny Dalglish won the Reds' first trophy in six years in 2012 when he managed the team to  League Cup victory after a penalty shoot-out win against Cardiff.

It didn't do him much good – he was sacked less than three months later.

Michael Laudrup was the manager to lift the League Cup in February 2013 as he led Swansea to the first major trophy in the club's history.

Alex McLeish masterminded Birmingham's 2011 League Cup success but his side were relegated three months afterwards and he resigned 

Jose Mourinho has been a victim of the curse - he left Chelsea seven months after the 2007 League Cup win

The Dane was sacked less than a year after the success.

Pellegrini and City are still fighting on three fronts, and the Chilean will not be panicking, but in the unforgiving world of modern football, his team's results may have to improve quickly if he is to avoid the League Cup manager's curse.
