Ravel Morrison was handed his season debut by West Ham manager Sam Allardyce on Tuesday night, just two days before he is due to appear for a preliminary hearing at Manchester Crown Court. 

The 21-year-old has been charged with two counts of common assault against his ex-girlfriend and her mother.

And he was unable to inspire the Hammers against Sheffield Untied as the Blades won 5-4 on penalties after a 1-1 draw in the Capital One Cup.

Unlucky: The midfielder was unable to secure West Ham's progress despite demonstrating his talent

West Ham fans had high hopes for Morrison, who played a major part in the promotion push of QPR, where he was on loan last season but he appears to have fallen back into the off-pitch trouble that was his undoing as a teenager at Manchester United’s academy, where Sir Alex Ferguson deemed him to be unmanageable.

On Tuesday night, the midfielder demonstrated the quick feet and smart football brain that saw him compared to Paul Gascgoine as he was emerging on the scene. 

Still got it: Morrison, who scored this brilliant goal last season, showed on Tuesday he can still have a role

His brilliant strike on 35 minutes would have opened the scoring were it not for an excellent save by United keeper Mark Howard. 

Just seconds later Morrison darted into the box, wrong footing his man but the good work was undone when he feigned being brought down and was booked for diving by referee James Linington. 

Morrison began the passing move that led to the West Ham goal. He passed out wide for Reece Burke, whose cross was headed into the far bottom corner of the net by Diafra Sakho. 

He was taken off and replaced by club veteran Mark Noble eight minutes into extra time. Morrison applauded the fans who cheered him in response.
