A bus driver who claims to have eaten over 500 takeaways a year for 20 years has given up his habit to shed a whopping six stone.

Mark Gadsby, from Ashbourne, Derbyshire, fed his addiction by tucking into Indian, Chinese and fish-and-chip takeaways at least once a day - and then binning the food packages to hide the evidence. 

But the 33-year-old ditched the convenience food and 20 years after being bullied as a teenager, he has shed six stone.

Mark, who works for a coach company, said: 'I'm utterly ashamed of what I was like. I would love to be able to ask myself what I was doing to myself before.

'I just see a massive fat person when I'm looking at old photos. I think, 'What an earth was I doing to myself?

'I was not eating all day when I was big - it was only at night. It was all about convenience food and the amount I ate was huge.

'I would always call at McDonald's after work, or a chippy or takeaway.

'I would always top that up with convenience food like hot pasties and sausage rolls from bakeries and fast-food places.

'From the age of 10 to 32 that pattern would continue and that's when I was really big. I was eating about 500 takeaways a year, which over that period of time is 10,000.

Mark suffered emotionally because of his weight and was a target of cruel bullies who made his life a misery

'Having all of that food, often late at night, gave me terrible indigestion and made me feel ill.

'It was awful. It was constant Greggs and Subway and it would be every day.'

Mark said he suffered emotionally because of his weight and was a target of cruel bullies who made his life a misery.

He said: 'There was a group of girls who would refer to me as Man Boobs - it was very hurtful. The bullying really hurt and made me feel worse than I did before.'

As Mark is a bus driver, he felt like he had to get his food quickly and on the go.

He said: 'I would use a drive-through quite a bit because I could go straight through and I didn't need to get out.

'I would hide the food packaging because I didn't want people to know. I was like an alcoholic craving booze.'

Mark moved in with his mother about two years ago and a combination of the Slimming World diet plan and his mum's cooking has meant the weight has dropped off.

He said: 'She helps me a great deal and it's brilliant to be back. She keeps me on track and there's no sneaking food now.

'Everything is freshly prepared and there's nowhere near the same amount of takeaways as before.'

Mark now hopes to be able to use his own experiences to help other people in their battle with weight as a Slimming World consultant.
