As international trade and tourism has grown in China so too has the need for English signs.

But while the Chinese are known for their love of learning English, some of their translators need to go back to the classroom.

From 'Fresh crap' to 'Horny care', Western travellers in the country are often left lost for words by the bizarre messages on some signs.

Strange: This parking sign could lead to embarrassing misunderstandings between drivers with its bizarre message

Keep out: A mix-up at the sign-writer's makes this tourist attraction seem less than welcoming

Warning: English speaking visitors are warned not to tread on 'smiling' lawn in this odd message

A collection of some of the humorous signs spotted around the country were posted on Offbeat China.

In some cases the amusing errors were caused by misinterpreting the Chinese characters, such as the peculiar advertisement in a supermarket aisle for 'A time sex thing'.

This was caused because the characters for 'disposable products' can also mean 'one' and 'sex' when read separately.

Special offer: This Chinese supermarket is left tongue-tied over its offer of disposable goods

Catch of the day: A misplaced letter at a fishmonger's makes the carp look less than appetising

Mixed messages: This spa is offering horny care alongside its more traditional treatments

Recipe for disaster: This menu translator will be left red-faced over this crude interpretation of a duck dish

Similarly, the Chinese character for 'dry' can sometimes be pronounced as 'f***', leading to the unfortunate menu item 'F*** the duck until exploded'.

The mistake was repeated at other restaurants as well a shop offering dried goods.

Other errors however, such as 'racist park' are caused by misunderstanding the meaning of the word. The sign in this case should have read 'ethnic museum'.

Odd: Wine drinkers appear to be warned off throwing their glasses in this sign

Customer service: This sign in a changing room left a holiday-maker baffled as to what the store was offering

Cakes: This garbled sign in a restaurant window in Shanghai is just about legible for foreign visitors

Language barrier: The owners of this restaurant need to hire a better translator

Other signs that have brought a smile to travellers in the region include a cash point that offers to 'recycle currency' and a bank receipt offering 'male service'.

And the intriguing sign spotted in a store changing room telling customers 'Don't touch yourself' is likely to have been a misplaced, but well-meaning offer to help fit clothes.

Sometimes the signs are just the product of sloppy work, such as the misplaced letter at a fishmonger making the carp on offer less appealing,

In some cases however, the real meaning of the translator's work will remain hidden, such as the spa offering 'horny care' alongside more traditional treatments.

And while their work may not be up to scratch, the translators have brightened many travellers' days with their amusing take on the English language.

Money laundering: This cash point offers to recycle money for green-minded travellers

Comical: This road warning sign is a comedy of errors following a mistake in translation

Offer: A sign in Chinese and English indicates a room or hotel for foreigners in Shenyang. How many people took up the offer is unclear however
