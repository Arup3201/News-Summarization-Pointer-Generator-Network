The woolly jumper brings a whole new meaning to the phrase 'parrot fashion'. 

But Charlie isn't merely trying to stand out from the flock. He was given the outfit to help him recover after he was starved for so long that he resorted to plucking his own feathers and eating them. 

Still he liked the bespoke jumper so much that new owner Rebecca Blagg knitted him four more in different colours.

Wrapped up warm: Fashionista Charlie in one of his five bespoke jumpers

And like a true fashionista, the green Eclectus parrot throws a tantrum if he is forced to change - stamping his feet, flapping his wings and squawking. 

‘He goes mad. He gets very, very agitated,’ she said.

‘The first summer after we had him it was red hot and I thought he was going to melt with his woolly on. I took it off and he started to go bonkers. I put it back on and he just calmed down straight away!

‘He went in a real grump, so after a while we just gave up trying. It’s like his comfort blanket.’ 

Mrs Blagg, 47, who is an area co-ordinator for the Safe Haven parrot rescue centre, took Charlie into her home after hearing about his poor health when rescued.

His condition was so weak that he couldn’t sit on his perch without falling off.

At first, she waited for his feathers to grow back, but decided in the meantime to knit him five woollen cardigans - one blue, green, white and yellow - to keep him warm.

Mrs Blagg, who lives in Eastwood, Nottinghamshire, said his favourite cardigan is the yellow one.

She added: ‘I am quite tough but when I saw him I burst into tears. It was so sad. The worse abuse case I’ve seen.

‘He had plucked himself. He had been eating his feathers to survive. He was at death’s door. I just wanted to give him a chance.

‘He was extremely shut down. He was very depressed. He wouldn’t move or do anything, he just sat there.

‘We had to feed him with a spoon because he couldn’t eat on his own and he couldn’t even perch because he was too weak. He just fell off. He was black and blue from falling off with his previous owner.’

Mrs Blagg finds homes for parrots across the country and currently has 16 in her home and 100 in the garden.
