A new study finds restaurant reviews may be affected by the forecast on the day they were written.

The study, conducted by researchers Saeideh Bakhshi, Partha Kanuparthy and Eric Gilbert looked at 840,000 restaurants and 1.1 million linked reviews between 2002 to 2011.

'Weather conditions are significantly associated with ratings,' the authors write.

'Reviews written on warm or cool days are more likely to be rated high than those written in cold or hot days. Reviews written on rainy or snowy days tend to have lower ratings than those written on days without rain or snow.'

Will this restaurant get a good review? A new study says that reviewers tend to give higher marks on sunny days between 70 and 100 degrees

'The best reviews are written on sunny days between 70 and 100 degrees,' Bakshi said in a press release.
 'Science has shown that weather impacts our mood, so a nice day can 
lead to a nice review. A rainy day can mean a miserable one.'

Diners also tend to give lower ratings to restaurants in July and August.

'People love to describe themselves as foodies. But in the end, it looks like weâ€™re all weather people, whether we realize it or not,' Bakshi said in the release. 

The authors also cited a previous study, which said that weather can influence the tips patrons leave at a restaurant, as well as the self-reported mood of waitresses.

They even said neighborhood diversity, education levels and population density may impact reviews.

Areas where more than 50 percent of the population have college degrees have on average nearly three times as may reviews than places where less than 10 percent graduated, they said.

In busier cities, patrons are reportedly more patient with wait times and expect delivery options. In smaller cities, carryout service was viewed more positively than delivery -- but the authors say reviewers were harsher on service.

Even region seems to play a role in the number of reviews.

'We also found that restaurants in the Northeast and Pacific get more reviews than places in the South and Midwest,' Bakshi said. 'I think the difference between the South and Pacific comes mostly from the differences in education, diversity and liberal versus conservative. Blue states such as California, Washington and Oregon have a higher number of reviews per restaurant.'

Restaurant owners may end up taking the reviews with a grain of salt.

'You can plan the best wedding or birthday party. Restaurants can serve great food and provide spectacular service,' Kanuparthy said in the release. 'But no one can control the weather. In the end, you canâ€™t beat Mother Nature.'
