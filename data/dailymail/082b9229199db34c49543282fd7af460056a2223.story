Chris Moyles could face a huge tax bill after a failed appeal over a £290m tax avoidance scheme in which he was involved

Former Radio One DJ Chris Moyles could be landed with a huge tax bill after a court ruled against a £290m tax avoidance scheme in which he was involved.

The breakfast show presenter - who netted a £700,000 annual salary from the BBC until he left his job in September 2012 - claimed he had incurred losses as a second-hand car dealer so he could avoid paying £1m in tax.

But the self-proclaimed 'saviour of Radio 1' was challenged by the taxman and the scheme - dubbed 'Working Wheels' - was later rejected by a tribunal. 

Now NT ('No Tax') Advisors LLP, which promoted the scheme, has warned Working Wheels investors that HM Revenue and Customs 'will seek to collect outstanding tax and interest,' according to The Mirror. 

The paper said two of Moyles's fellow investors tried to appeal again the ruling, but failed. 

In a letter seen by the paper, the boss of NT Matthew Jenner said it was a 'disappointing result' which he believed had been 'very much affected' by press coverage about tax avoidance.

He wrote: 'Clearly this is a disappointing result, made the more given our efforts to be heard by the higher Courts have been thwarted.

'We believe that the courts, especially the lower Tribunals, are being very much affected by press coverage on tax avoidance and that is a dangerous development in any judicial system.'

Moyles was one of 450 celebrities, fund managers and other top earners to try to avoid tax by taking part in the scheme. 

It worked by allowing members of the scheme to say they had incurred huge fees while working in the second-hand car trade, which they could claim back against their tax bill. 

Variants of the scheme included claiming losses from dealing in other high-value items such as watches or cash receivables.

On the self-assessment tax return that Moyles filed for the financial year ending in April 2008, when he was presenting the BBC Radio 1 show, he claimed he 'had engaged in self-employment as a used-car trader'.

He moved his earnings around a string of banks and charitable trusts to claim that he had made the loss.

But the tax tribunal ruled this was just a ruse to save tax. It found that, far from being a car dealer, Moyles had never supplied any vehicles and had 'no interest' in doing so.

Chris Moyles took to Twitter after the ruling to say that he always thought the scheme was legal

Nor did he have the faintest idea how much the cars he was supposedly trading cost to buy and to sell.

When HMRC rejected the scheme, Moyles and two other members appealed to a tax court.

In February this year, tax judge Colin Bishopp rejected the appeal, saying it was clear he 'entered the scheme for no purpose other than to achieve a tax saving'.

He said the 'scale of Mr Moyles' borrowing was driven solely by the amount of the tax loss he wanted to achieve.

HMRC is said to be seeking to recoup the outstanding tax and interest from the scheme 

The ruling said Moyles was 'anxious to be reassured the scheme was lawful, and that he would not have to undertake any trading himself'.

After the outcome, Moyles took to Twitter to say: 'Upon advice, I signed up to a scheme which I was assured was legal. My knowledge of the dealings of the scheme were naive. I'm not a tax expert and acted on advice. This was a mistake and I accept the ruling without reservation.'

But during his year-long battle with the taxman, Moyles desperately tried to keep his avoidance scheme secret.

His legal team argued the tribunal should be heard behind closed doors so as not to infringe his 'right to respect for his private and family life'.

His lawyer also said if his membership were exposed, 'his career might be damaged'.

Judge Bishopp rejected this on the grounds there was an obvious public interest in keeping tax cases public.

Many of the organisations involved in the scheme were based in low-tax and highly private jurisdictions such as Jersey, the Channel Islands and the British Virgin Islands.

A HMRC spokesman said: 'We don't in general comment on individual cases.

'We are always happy to help the increasing numbers of people who want to disentangle themselves from the fruitless practice of tax avoidance.' 

MailOnline has contacted Mr Moyles's representatives for comment.
