Thibaut Courtois insists Chelsea do not have the Premier League title ‘in the bag’.

The Belgium No 1 says winning the trophy will be ‘very difficult’ despite the failings this season of champions Manchester City, Liverpool, Arsenal and United.

Chelsea are four points clear at the top of the table, with only Southampton keeping pace in second. Jose Mourinho’s team have dropped just four points in 11 games and remain unbeaten, moving eight clear of Manuel Pellegrini’s side in third.

Arsenal are 12 points behind, United 13 back and Liverpool, last season’s runners-up, a sizeable 15 points adrift.

Chelsea’s rapid start mirrors Mourinho’s previous title-winning campaigns, in 2004-05 and 2005-06, but Courtois says it is too early to declare them champions-elect.

‘We don’t have the title in the bag,’ he said. ‘We are working game by game. The Premier League is very difficult.

‘We are trying to win with every game that is possible. But there will be a still a long way to win the title. We are working hard. Hopefully that will be enough.’

Courtois also said he would not stop giving honest appraisals to team-mates, including those at Chelsea, after delivering a strong rebuke to his national colleagues following their defensively frail 3-1 friendly win over Iceland.

He said players who did not want to run should not play and claimed Wales would crush his side if they were to repeat that performance during their Euro 2016 qualifier.

As it was the match on Wednesday night ended 0-0 and Courtois, 22, said his words of warning were justified. He did accept that with John Terry and Didier Drogba in the Chelsea dressing room, the elder statesmen would tend to take the lead.

Asked whether he will be as vocal for his club as his nation, he said: ‘Yes maybe that happens. But there are also other guys who can say something. Just to say some names, Terry or Drogba, they have experience and leadership. I just said it (his Belgium criticism) as I thought that we should be better.’
