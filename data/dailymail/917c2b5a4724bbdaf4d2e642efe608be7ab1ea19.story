She might have been asked for a kiss during her trip to Normandy last week, but the Duchess of Cambridge got a very different reception when she met a bashful little flower girl in Greenwich today.

Bo Cornwell, who was at the breakfast reception to launch the UK's America's Cup bid at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich with her father, was overcome by nerves when the royal guest approached and buried her face in her father's shoulder.

Luckily, the Duchess, who was dressed in pretty nautical-inspired cream and navy shift dress by high street favourite Jaeger, wasn't at all put out and smiled and chatted with Bo and her father Matt Cornwell, a three-time America's Cup veteran, as she - eventually - was handed her posy.

The Duchess, a sailing enthusiast 
herself, was at Greenwich to help Sir Ben Ainslie launch a drive to find a crack team of mariners with the potential 
to become a winning crew by 2017, launch the UK's bid for America's Cup glory in 2017.

The pair were joined by another famous sailing fan, Duran Duran star Simon Le Bon, who is also supporting the UK bid to take the America's Cup, the oldest trophy in sport.

Known affectionately as the 'Auld Mug', the cup was first offered as a prize by Queen Victoria in 1851, who volunteered to present it to the winner of a sailing race around the Isle of Wight.

After a schooner named America from New York took the trophy, which was made especially for the race by jewellers Garrard, the cup was renamed in its honour, and both cup and race have carried the moniker ever since.

A two-yacht race, the America's Cup is fought between the previous year's winner - known as the 'defender' - and a challenger, which is usually the best boat from a series of run-off rounds. 

All smiles: The Duchess of Cambridge seemed in 
good spirits as she toured the National Maritime Museum and met

It might be named for the new world, but the America's Cup has very British origins.

First offered by Queen Victoria in 1851, the inaugural America's Cup race was run around the Isle of Wight.

After a boat from New York named America triumphed, the cup was renamed and teams from the US have dominated the winner's roll call of honour ever since.

But while Britannia might rule the waves
 in other respects, a British team is yet to take the trophy which, 
despite having been won by Swiss and Australian teams in the past, has 
for the most part been doggedly defended by the Americans - among them 
last year's winner, San Francisco's Golden Gate Yacht Club - throughout 
its 132-year history.

That, however, is something the Duchess 
of Cambridge and Sir Ben hope to change, and hope, given enough 
sponsorship, to assemble a race-winning boat and the sailors to crew it 
over the next three years.

After chatting with sponsors, among them former Duran Duran star Simon Le Bon, the Duchess toured the museum and was handed a posy by a little flower girl who seemed a bit overwhelmed by the royal visitor.

It was a far cry from the Duchess' last engagement - a tea party in Arromanche for D-Day veterans, 
where she was given a peck on the cheek by one octogenarian who asked her 
whether it was 'OK to kiss a princess'.

Arthur Jones, 88, was one of 50 veterans to meet the royal couple and was told, 'Of course it is' when he made his cheeky request. But the former Desert Rat's kiss from a princess did earn him a jokey telling off from the Duke of Cambridge - much to his delight.

Mr Jones, from Wolverhampton, added: 'As the Prince left he said to me: "Were you chatting up my wife?" I told him I only gave her a kiss.

William laughed but I’m chuffed I’ve chatted up a Princess. I bet I’ll be picked up now and taken to the Tower of London!

'It was a lovely kiss – she is very sweet and very lovely. I lost my wife 10 years ago and I’m on my own now so I don’t get many opportunities for kisses any more.'

Afterwards, the Duchess and her husband Prince William continued on to Gold Beach, which was was one of two subjected to an assault by British troops, and where they were shown a reconstruction of the events of that day.

Leading the charge was the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division commanded by Major General Douglas Alexander Graham, and the 8th Armoured Brigade, but despite the presence of some of the veterans, the fierce fighting also saw more than 400 British soldiers lose their lives.
