Hillary Clinton's new book has drawn praise from an unexpected corner: Tea Party darling and walking soundbite Sarah Palin.

Palin, who admitted she has only read the chapter in Clinton's Hard Choices about herself, said she admired Clinton for describing tactics used by the Obama camp during the 2008 election.

In an email interview with the Hollywood Reporter, Palin also discussed her reality series Amazing America, her eagerness to join the panel on The View and her thoughts on the state of 'incorrigibly disastrous' politics.

High praise: Palin said she admires Hillary Clinton for a revealing chapter in her memoir

Hard choice: Palin has read one chapter in Hillary Clinton's memoir about herself

When asked about Hillary Clinton's memoir Palin said, 'I appreciated her boldness in explaining that behind-the-scenes campaign tactic of Obama’s,' referring to a chapter in which Clinton detailed how she refused to engage in an attack on Palin based on her gender.

She said she'd read the chapter because her attorney sent it to her - which doesn't bode well for the likelihood that she'll read the rest of the book.

In language replete with gun metaphor, Palin explained that she has recovered from her election defeat, 'reloaded' and is ready for new challenges.

Palin indicated she believes a show like The View would benefit from her 'real-life groundedness [sic], candor and commonsense.' 

Successful: Palin's Amazing America series has been renewed for another season

'I hear everyone recently got canned from The View, maybe a show like that needs a punch of reality and a voice of reason from America's heartland to knock some humble sense into their scripts,' she told the Hollywood Reporter.

'You know, someone willing to go rogue.'

Representatives from The View have not commented on whether or not Palin will be considered for the panel, but the former Alaska Governor's approach is working on her new series that screens on the Sportsman Channel.

Amazing America with Sarah Palin has been renewed for a second season.

'Sportsman Channel has experienced tremendous growth this year and Sarah Palin’s involvement has proved to be a tremendous boon for our network and programming initiatives,' Marc Fein, executive vice president of programming and production told the Hollywood Reporter.
