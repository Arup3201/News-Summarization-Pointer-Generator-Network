Banksy's latest creation in New York is an open-air gallery featuring two pieces on canvas hanging under the High Line in Chelsea.

The pieces appear to be a collaboration between Banksy and Brazilian twins, Os Gemeos.

Banksy reportedly paid the owner of the space $50,000 to hang his two paintings under the overpass on West 24th between 10th and 11th Avenues.

Best behavior: Banksy's guards imposed strict rules on crowds eager to view and photograph the works

It's the latest installment of 'Better Out Than In,' Banksy's month-long 'residency' in New York City.

The artist announced the works himself on his website.

'Are you the sort of person who enjoys going to art galleries, but wished they had more gravel in them? Then this temporary exhibition space is for you. Housing just two paintings but also featuring a bench, some carpet and complimentary refreshments. Opens today through Sunday 11am til midnight,' he wrote.

Refreshments is probably overstating it a little, unless you're in the market for some yellow liquid, reportedly non-alcoholic white wine, dispensed through a water cooler.

The New York Post reports that guards watching over the paintings gave onlookers strict instructions for viewing the works.

'This is a private exhibit. There is zero tolerance. If you act up, we will close the gates and that’s that,' said a guard.

'You guys come in  small groups . You get five minutes and then we rotate. Everybody gets a fair chance to go in and see the piece. No alcohol no dogs and if you guys behave yourselves we’ll be good to go,' onlookers were told.

According to Gothamist, the space is owned by New York property developer Alf Naman.

Banksy has caused quite a stir in the Big Apple, where he's undertaking a month-long self-imposed residency. New Yorkers wake every morning to discover a new work adorning some corner of the city.

Mayor Michael Bloomberg said last week that graffiti ruins property and is 'a sign of decay,' but  said the NYPD is not actively searching for the artful artist.
