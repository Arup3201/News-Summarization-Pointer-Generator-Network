It's a sight many traveller longs to see.

And this incredible time-lapse video reveals just how spectacular the Northern Lights really is.

Filmed in Norway at the weekend, the entrancing 37-second footage shows green lights dancing and flashing across the sky. 

Stunning display: The video of the Northern Lights was captured in Norway

The varying green hues of the Aurora Borealis are both captivating and mysterious as they dance majestically through the sky. 

The latest Northern Lights display was created after a solar blast on Friday, September 12.

As a result of the blast a large amount of clouds, which were made up of magnetically charged particles, were pushed towards Earth.

Although green was the primary colour during this recent Northern Lights display in Norway, varying colours such as pinks, reds, blues and yellows are also frequently visible during displays.

The colours are created during a process known as a coronal mass ejection which is a massive burst of solar wind and magnetic fields. 

There are two types of Aurora - Aurora Borealis, which means ‘dawn of the north’, and Aurora Australis’, known as ‘dawn of the south.’

They are caused when electrically charged particles from the sun enter the Earth’s atmosphere. 

These so-called geomagnetic storms occur when a solar wind or cloud of magnetic field hits the Earth’s magnetic field.

Usually the charged particles from the sun are deflected by the Earth’s magnetic field, but some do manage to enter the atmosphere and collide with gas particles. These collisions emit light.

As a result, Aurora is most common around the magnetic poles and is most often seen in areas with little light pollution. 

Auroral displays appear in many colours although pale green and pink are the most common. Shades of red, yellow, green, blue, and violet have also been reported.

The common, greenish-yellow colour is caused by colliding oxygen molecules approximately 60 miles (96km) above Earth. Rare, red auroras are produced by oxygen molecules situated much higher up, at around 200 miles (321km).

Nitrogen produces blue or purplish-red aurora.
