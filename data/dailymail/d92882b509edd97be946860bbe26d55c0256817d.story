Pope Francis today proclaimed hundreds of 15th-century martyrs beheaded for refusing to convert to Islam as saints of the Catholic Church, as he led his first canonization ceremony in a packed St. Peter's Square.

The 'Martyrs of Otranto' were 813 Italians who were slain in the southern Italian city in 1480 for defying demands to renounce Christianity by Turkish invaders who overran the citadel.

Their approval for sainthood was decided upon by Francis' predecessor, Benedict XVI, in a decree read at the ceremony in February where the former pontiff announced his retirement.

It is estimated around 60,000 Catholics gathered in St. Peter's Square during Pope Francis' canonization mass at the Vatican

The Vatican seemed at pains not to allow the first canonisations of Francis' two-month-old papacy to be interpreted as anti-Islamic, saying the deaths of the 'Otranto Martyrs' must be understood in their historical context.

Shortly after his election in March, Francis called for more dialogue with Muslims but it is unclear how the granting of sainthood to the martyrs will be received.

The first pontiff from South America also gave Colombia its first saint - a nun who toiled as a teacher and spiritual guide to indigenous people in the 20th century.

With Colombia's President Juan Manuel Santos among the VIPS, the Argentine pope held out Laura of St. Catherine of Siena Montoya y Upegui as a potential source of inspiration to the country's peace process, attempted after decades-long conflict between rebels and government forces.

Francis prayed that 'Colombia's beloved children continue to work for peace and just development of the country'.

He also canonized another Latin American woman. Maria Guadalupe Garcia Zavala, a Mexican who dedicated herself to nursing the sick, helped Catholics avoid persecution during a government crackdown on the faith in the 1920s.

The 'Martyrs of Otranto' were 813 Italians who were slain in the southern Italian city in 1480 for defying demands to renounce Christianity by Turkish invaders who overran the citadel.

They were killed during the year-long siege of Otranto, on the southeastern Adriatic, by Ottoman Turks who sacked the city, killed its archbishop and told the citizens to surrender and convert.

When they refused, the Ottoman commanding officer ordered the execution of all men aged 15 or older, most by beheading.

Roman Catholic sainthood requires that two miracles be attributed to those who are being made saints - one before beatification, and another before canonisation.

In the case of the 813 Italians, the requirement for the first miracle was waived because they were killed 'in hatred of the faith'.

The miracle approved for their canonisation was that of a nun who had cancer which, according to the Church, was healed after she prayed at a memorial to the martyrs in Otranto.

Also known as Mother Lupita, she hid the Guadalajara archbishop in an eye clinic for more than a year after fearful local Catholic families refused to shelter him.

Francis prayed that the new Mexican saint's intercession could help the nation 'eradicate all the violence and insecurity,' an apparent reference to years of bloodshed and other crime largely linked to powerful drug trafficking clans.

Francis told the crowd that the martyrs are a source of inspiration, especially for 'so many Christians, who, right in these times and in so many parts of the world, still suffer violence.' He prayed that they receive 'the courage of loyalty and to respond to evil with good.'

The pope didn't single out any country. But Christian churches have been attacked in Nigeria and Iraq, and Catholics in China loyal to the Vatican have been subject to harassment and sometimes jail over the last decades.

Christians in Saudi Arabia must 
worship out of the public eye because the ultraconservative kingdom does
not officially permit churches and non-Muslim religious sites.

Francis, the first pope from the 
Jesuit order, which is known for its missionary zeal, praised the 
Colombian saint for 'instilling hope' in the indigenous people. He said 
she taught them in a way that 'respected their culture'.

Many
Catholic missionaries over the centuries have been criticized for 
demanding natives renounce local traditions the outsiders viewed as 
primitive.

The pope 
also hailed the Mexican saint for renouncing a comfortable life to work 
with the sick and poor, even kneeling on the bare floor of the hospital 
before the patients to serve them with 'tenderness and compassion'.

Mother Lupita's example, said Francis, should encourage people not to 'get wrapped up in themselves, their own problems, their own ideas, their own interests, but to go out and meet those who need attention, comprehension, help' and other assistance.

After shaking hands with the prelates and VIPS in the front rows at the end of the Mass, Francis shed his ceremonial vestments. Wearing a plain white cassock, he climbed into an open white popemobile to ride up and down the security paths surrounding the crowd of more than 60,000.

He stopped to pat children on the head, kiss babies and bantered in his native Spanish with some at the edge of the crowd.

Francis noted that the crowd included participants in an anti-abortion march of several thousand people, who walked a few kilometers (miles) from the Colosseum, crossing a bridge over the Tiber river to end near the Vatican while Mass was being celebrated in St. Peter's Square.

He drew attention to a signature-gathering drive in many Italian churches to push for a European initiative to 'guarantee legal protection for embryos, protecting every human being from the first instant of existence'.
