Heavy rain was this morning delaying efforts to rescue more than 50 people still missing after landslides the Japanese city of Hiroshima.

Hillsides caved in or were swept down into neighbourhoods in at least five valleys in the suburbs of the western Japanese city on Wednesday, crushing dozens of houses after heavy rains.

Officials said 39 people were confirmed dead and 51 others were missing, feared dead, as of yesterday. Twenty-three people were injured, 13 seriously, they said.

Danger: Police officers move to higher ground after an announcement to evacuate due to fears of another landslide

Rescue workers today feared the continuing rain could set off further landslides in the area. About 2,500 police and military personnel have been searching for the missing in the mud-covered areas.

At one point work had to be abandoned and the area evacuated when it looked like another landslide might tear through the area. 

Among those killed were two brothers, aged 11 and 2, and a firefighter who was engulfed by mud as he was carrying a toddler to safety. The child also perished.

'There was a really strange smell, a very raw, earthy smell. When we opened a window to see what was going on, the entire hillside just came down, with a crackling noise, a thundering noise,' one woman told Fuji television.

She and her husband fled just before their house filled with mud, leaving five-metre boulders where they had been sleeping.

A police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with official policy, said there was a possibility of some inaccuracies in the tally of those killed and injured in the disaster.

A month's worth of rain fell in one night on Wednesday, loosening slopes already saturated by heavy rain over the past few weeks.

Hiroshima city officials have faced criticism because their initial evacuation advisory came an hour after the first mudslide.

Officials said their response was delayed because the land collapsed so quickly at multiple locations.

Opposition politicians have also rounded on Prime Minister Shinzo Abe for his handling of the disaster. He played several rounds of golf on the day the news broke, before coming back to Tokyo, the capital.

He then returned to his vacation villa afterwards.

Landslides are a constant risk in mountainous, crowded Japan, where many homes are built on or near steep slopes.

Hiroshima's geology, consisting of highly water-retentive soil, makes the city particularly prone to such disasters, experts say.

About 9in of rain fell in the area about 2 miles from the centre of the city in the 24 hours up to Wednesday morning, the Meterological Agency said.

Roughly half of that rain fell in one hour.
