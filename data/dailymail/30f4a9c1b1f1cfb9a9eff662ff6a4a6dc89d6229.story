Federal aviation authorities are prohibiting U.S. airlines and other commercial carriers from flying over Iraq as U.S. bombing missions begin.

The FAA announced the ban Friday, citing the 'potentially hazardous situation' created by fighting between militants and Iraqi security forces and their allies as U.S. military planes begin strategic airstrikes against the Islamic State.

The ban applies to all U.S.-registered planes except those operated by foreign carriers and to FAA-licensed pilots and comes only one day after President Obama authorized the attacks.

Banned: A Turkish Airlines plane taking off from Ataturk Airport in Istanbul. Turkish Airlines, one of the key foreign carriers flying to Iraq. All flights to, from and over the country have been suspended until further notice

Ghost town: Only three flights were over Iraq late Friday afternoon, and two of them were leaving the country, according to Flight Radar

There is an exception for flights operated with U.S. government permission and for emergency situations.

Obama announced Thursday evening that targeted attacks on Islamic State strongholds battering Kurdish forces in the northern part of the country would soon begin.

Two 500-pound, laser-guided bombs were dropped on enemy artillery equipment Friday morning near the Kurdish capital or Erdil, according to the Pentagon.

The target was U.S.-made and had been abandoned by Iraqi Army soldiers that fled as their position was overrun by militants, according to reports.

The FAA previously had limited flights over Iraq to altitudes no lower than 30,000 feet.

The ban comes just three weeks after a Malaysia Airlines plane with nearly 300 people on board was shot down over eastern Ukraine as tensions between Russia and the former Soviet satellite republic continue to escalate.Â
