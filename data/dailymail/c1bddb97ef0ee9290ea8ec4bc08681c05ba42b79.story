Stabbed to death: Stephen Lawrence

The two racist thugs convicted of murdering Stephen Lawrence were awarded a total of £425,000 of legal aid, official figures reveal.

Gary Dobson, 37, and David Norris, 36, each received more than £200,000  of taxpayers’ money to fight their  murder charges.

The amount of money claimed by the teenager’s killers emerged days after  the Government vowed to crack down on ‘fat-cat’ legal aid solicitors and barristers.

After a six-month freedom of information battle with the authorities, the Mail has finally been given details of the amount of legal aid claimed by Dobson and Norris, both jailed for life in January last year after being convicted of Stephen’s 1993 murder.

Our initial request in December last year was turned down by the now defunct Legal Services Commission because the pair were appealing their convictions and officials ruled that disclosing the figures could prejudice any potential retrial.

But Dobson has since dropped his legal challenge and Norris’s bid to clear his name has been thrown out by the Appeal Court.

The figures provided to the Mail show drug trafficker Dobson was awarded £199,109 of legal aid in the run-up to and during his murder trial, and a further £4,200 for his doomed appeal.

Gangster’s son Norris received £222,346 in legal aid to defend the murder charge. Details of how much public money, if any, he received to fund his appeal have not been finalised.

Their combined legal aid awards come to £425,655 and dwarf the £320,000 compensation paid to Stephen’s parents Doreen and Neville Lawrence for police bungles that hampered their quest for justice. The Crown Prosecution Service’s counsel fees for the prosecution and related hearings was £287,056.

Dobson’s legal team was headed by Timothy Roberts QC, while Stephen Batten QC led Norris’s defence. After a six-week trial, an Old Bailey jury ruled in January last year that Dobson and Norris were guilty of murdering Stephen, 18, in Eltham, south-east London in April 1993. The pair, who were among a gang of five racist thugs who stabbed Stephen to death, were jailed for life.

The verdicts were a victory for the Daily Mail, which since 1997 has campaigned for justice for the  Lawrence family.

After their convictions, Norris launched an appeal, claiming that the use of a surveillance video in evidence was prejudicial.

In the film, shot 20 months after Stephen’s murder, Norris was secretly filmed telling friends he wanted to torture and kill black people. His lawyers said the video did not prove he was involved in Stephen’s murder and should not have been admitted as evidence.

The footage also showed Dobson using violent, racist language. He was seen recalling a time he threatened a black colleague with a knife.

Lawyers for Norris also objected to the way prosecutors presented scientific evidence in the trial.

The breakthrough in the investigation came when a cold-case team of forensic scientists were called in. They found tiny traces of blood, hair and fibres on clothing seized from the pair’s homes.

The defence claimed this was the result of contamination, but that was rejected by the jury.

This March, just over a month before the 20th anniversary of the murder, Dobson finally dropped the appeal against his conviction.

In May, Norris lost a second attempt to challenge his conviction when he was refused permission to appeal by the Court of Appeal.

Met chief Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe has told the Mail he has no plans to close the investigation into Stephen’s murder, which puts pressure on the three other members of the gang that killed Stephen, brothers Neil and Jamie Acourt and their friend Luke Knight, who have not been convicted.

Hopes of a breakthrough in the long-running murder probe rose in April after police said a 20th anniversary appeal for information had prompted ‘two very significant’ phone calls.

Last week, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said the amount paid out in legal aid was ‘unsustainable’, adding that taxpayers could not keep footing the bill for a system said to cost £2billion a year.

A spokesman for the Legal Aid Agency, which replaced the LSC, said: ‘Anyone on trial for a serious criminal offence can apply for legal aid so a lawyer can represent them in court. Funding is subject to a means test which could require  the defendant to pay towards their legal costs.’
