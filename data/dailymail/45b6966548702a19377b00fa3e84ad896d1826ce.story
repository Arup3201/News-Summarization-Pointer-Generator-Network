A small earthquake  shook houses in the Melbourne suburb of Pakenham overnight.

Geoscience Australia said the 2.8-magnitude quake, at a depth of 10km, struck the southeast of the city at 11.39pm on Tuesday.

The quake was followed by a 1.3-magnitude aftershock at 3.18am. 

More than 300 people reported feeling the earthquake to Geoscience Australia, from suburbs as far as 50km from the epicentre including Montrose in the east and Port Melbourne in the Inner City.

'They generally report hearing loud earth noises and some rattling of windows and the earth shook for some people who were a bit closer to the event,' Geoscience Australia's Andrea Thom told the ABC.

'You wouldn't expect any damage and we haven't received any reports in this regard.'

Earthquake quickly began trending on Twitter in Melbourne, as the city's residents headed to the social media network site to share their experiences.

Suzanna Masri tweeted: 'Suddenly awoken by what felt like an #earthquake. Loud piercing rumble then floor shaking. #Melbourne #Pakenham.'

Chris S, from Berwick, said he heard 'four seconds of rumbling then a very loud crack'. 

Bianca, @AussyGal, tweeted 'Earthquake or giant bird landing on my roof? #earthquake #Melbourne', while Simon Coulton, @simoncoulton, wrote 'Nothing like an #earthquake mid coding session to scare the pants off you #melbourne'.

Although the severity of the quake was questioned by some, including Ryan Alavi, @ralavi, who posted: 'My thoughts and prayers with all #Melbourne who had to check their twitter to confirm if there was really and #earthquake'.

This comes after a 3.1-magnitude quake hit Moe, to the east of Pakenham, last week. 

Prof Mike Sandiford, from the University of Melbourne's School of Earth Sciences, said there had been a few hundred earthquakes in the South Gippsland area and its surrounds since a large 5.6 magnitude earthquake hit the area in 2012.

'It's a reasonably active area by Australian standards, and this is a more active phase,' Prof Sandiford said.

'The area's releasing more seismic energy than it had in a few years.'
