Oprah Winfrey, David Geffen and Larry Ellison want to buy the embattled LA Clippers from disgraced owner Donald Sterling.

The three billionaires with a combined wealth of $60 billion revealed on Wednesday that they have formed a consortium to take over the NBA team in the wake of 80-year-old Sterling's lifetime ban from the league.

Television entrepreneur Winfrey, is joining forces with the world's fifth richest man, Ellison and entertainment mogul Geffen to pry the franchise from Sterling's grip - after he revealed he would not sell the team he bought for $12 million in 1982.

Confirming the move with ESPN's Jeremy Schaap, Winfrey's representative said that she is 'in discussions with D. Geffen and L. Ellison to make a bid for the LA Clippers should the team become available.'

Geffen said he and Ellison would run the team, while Winfrey would be an investor.

Speaking directly to Geffen, worth $6.2 billion, Schaap posted to Twitter that the DreamWorks founder is determined to buy the Clippers with the Oracle founder, who is worth $49.3 billion.

'Larry would sooner die than fail. I would sooner die than fail. Larry's a sportsman, we've talked about this for a long time. Between the three of us, we have a good shot.'

Geffen said that Winfrey, worth $2.9 billion was ready to take on ownership of the team, who are currently in the playoffs.

'She thinks it would be a great thing for an important black American to own (another) franchise.'

Despite his self-declared love of the LA Lakers, Geffen said that as a basketball supporter his enthusiasm and business know-how would only benefit the Clippers.

'I'm a fan, I bring something to the table with the success I've had in many areas of the entertainment industry, it's fun and I can afford it.'

Most industry insiders estimate that Sterling will rake in up to $780 million if he is forced to sell the LA Clippers by the NBA's Board of Governors.

However, despite the celebrity billionaire bid, Donald Sterling is refusing to sell his team - signaling a lengthy and costly legal battle with the NBA.

NBA commissioner Adam Silver has told Sterling that he wants him to sell the Clippers as part of the extreme sanctions brought against the owner in response to racist comments he was recorded making by a former girlfriend.

'I fully expect to get the support I need from the other NBA owners to remove him,' Silver said.

The NBA on Tuesday banned Sterling from the game for life and fined him $2.5 million for racist comments that drew a storm of outrage from players, fans, commercial sponsors and even President Barack Obama.

However experts have said that Sterling, a lawyer and real estate tycoon could tie up the sale for the rest of his life.

'It would be an absolute disaster,' said Richard Sheehan, the author of 'Keeping Score: The Economics of Big-Time Sports', to the LA Times.

Under fire: Sterling was interviewed by NBA investigators and they determined that it was his voice on the tape and he did hold the 'hateful' views

They point out that there is not clear legal authority for the NBC to force Sterling to sell because of private remarks.

'It's distasteful, it's disgusting, but what he said is still ostensibly private conduct,' Robert Boland, an NYU sports management professor told The LA Times.

Sports Illustrated said that the three-quarter procedure to force a sale is based on financial difficulties not punishment.

Geffen, is a music and film mogul worth $6.2 billion and tried to buy the Clippers in 2010 for $600 million but was turned down by Sterling.

However, if the battle to buy the Clippers becomes a bidding war, only a handful of men have more money than Ellison.

Geffen, who started two record labels and the Dreamworks film studio with Jeffrey Katzenberg and director Steven Spielberg, had expressed interest in the past in buying the Clippers but never made an offer.

Sterling, the longest-tenured owner of any of the 30 NBA teams, will be barred from any role in the operations of his team or be able to serve as one of the league's governors, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said at a news conference in New York.

The controversy began over the weekend when the celebrity website TMZ.com released an audio recording ostensibly of Sterling criticizing a woman friend for associating with 'black people.'

Boxing superstar Floyd Mayweather Jr. and music mogul Sean Combs both claimed interest in buying the team Tuesday, as did real-estate tycoon Rick Caruso.
