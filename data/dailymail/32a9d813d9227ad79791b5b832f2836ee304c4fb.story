Secret mission: Gwilym Williams from Swansea was sent to Belgium in 1939, by the MI5 to infiltrate the Abwehr, Hitler's spy service

A former Welsh police inspector became a double agent pretending to work for Hitler while feeding vital information to MI5.

Gwilym Williams from Swansea was sent to Belgium in 1939, to infiltrate the Abwehr, Hitler’s spy service.

He constructed a fake persona as a  fanatical Welsh nationalist and was so convincing that he managed to uncover a series of secrets.

He informed the M15 about a plot to land a German
U-boat on a South Wales beach, a scheme to steal a Spitfire.

He even intercepted a plan 
to pour poison into the Cray Reservoir near Brecon, which would have caused havoc if it had been successful.

Mr Williams died aged 62 in 1949, but his story was only recently discovered after an author researching a book learned of his story in declassified security files at the National Archive.

His escapades are detailed by John Humphries in his book called Spying For Hitler, reported the Mirror.

The files revealed that he left the police force in his home city of Swansea with a record showing   he been reprimanded for being drunk on duty and assaulting residents.

The only noteworthy fact on his record was that he had once stopped a run-away horse.

But in September 1939, MI5 sent him to Belgium to infiltrate the Abwehr, Hitler’s spy service.

The book tells how Mr Williams was recruited after intelligence led spy chiefs to realise that the Nazis were planning to forge links with Welsh nationalists.

As a direct response MI5 invented an imaginary cell of Welsh saboteurs led by the retired police inspector, who had learned French and German during the First World War.

Mr Williams' training was almost non-existent and the only demand was that he had to memorise the names of prominent members of the Welsh nationalist party.

He was dispatched to Antwerp to meet his German handlers and carried out his spy duties with resounding success,  although he risked being tortured if caught.

'He had the Abwehr jumping through hoops and helped us win the intelligence war,' said Mr Humphries.

Among his missions were plans to destalbilise the enemy bases such as aerodromes, power stations and munitions factories.

He became so deeply entrenched with the Nazis that at one point he was offered  £50,000  to fly a British spitfire over to France so it could be examined by them.

Mr Humphries said: 'John
Masterman, chairman of the Twenty Committee which ran the double-cross 
system, regarded Gwilym Williams as Britain’s best agent.
