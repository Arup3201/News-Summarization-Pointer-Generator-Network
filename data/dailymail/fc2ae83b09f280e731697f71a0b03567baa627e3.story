Often naked: Gerard Leeper has been identified as the serial nudist in Charlotte, North Carolina

A serial nudist whose regular spells lounging naked in his front door have horrified neighbors has been arrested four times before for indecent exposure.

Gerard Leeper, who routinely stands au naturel at his front doorway in Charlotte, North Carolina, has reportedly kept up the habit for a decade - bringing him up close and personal with the law several times.

However, due to the nuances of North Carolina's criminal code, Leeper's nudity is not actually illegal - and three out of four charges he faced were dropped.

Exasperated police in the city have even suggested lobbying the North Carolina General Assembly to change the law and criminalize Leeper's naked ways, the Charlotte Observer reported.

As it stands, the state's indecent exposure law requires 'willfully exposing the private parts of his or her person in any public place and in the presence of any other person or persons'.

As Leeper's home is not a 'public place', he isn't committing a crime.

However, a police spokesman said they want to change the law to include 'a place that can be readily observed by the public' - like a front door.

Leeper's latest bout of nudity was exposed by the WBTV news station.

One neighbor, Pecolia Threatt, said: 'I was rolling out the trash can on Friday and I just happened to look over there and he was standing there buck naked.'

Police have reportedly been called to Leeper's home four times already in 2015. He has been charged with indecent exposure four times, though the dates are unclear.

One charge, in 2006, was successful, and landed Leeper in jail for ten days. He has also reportedly been convicted for violating a protective order, resisting a public officer and communicating threats.

Of the situation, the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department said: 'We are currently looking at the unique facts in this case...

'In all likelihood we will be approaching the legislature with a recommendation that the law be amended to include not only a public place, but a place that can be readily observed by the public'.

Homeowners in the area were due to hold a crisis meeting about Leeper on Monday, but were keeping the media out.
