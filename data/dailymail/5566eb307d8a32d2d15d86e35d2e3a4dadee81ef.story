Queensland's premier says Russian President Vladimir Putin isn't welcome at this year's G20 conference in Brisbane unless he co-operates with a probe into the MH17 disaster.

Flags across the state will fly at half mast on Saturday in tribute to the seven Queenslanders who were among 298 killed when a Malaysia Airlines plane was shot down in eastern Ukraine.

Suspicion has fallen on Russian-backed rebels armed with Russian artillery but Mr Putin has said Ukraine bears responsibility for the crash which left 298 people dead, including 28 Australians.

He has blamed that country's crackdown on separatist rebels for stoking tensions.

On Saturday, Queensland Premier Campbell Newman called on Mr Putin and the Russian government to fully co-operate with an independent international investigation.

'If Mr Putin's not prepared to do that, well frankly I believe that Queenslanders don't want him here at the G20,' Mr Newman said.

'He has the opportunity to demonstrate some good faith and that can be done by properly getting behind international efforts to get to the bottom of what is clearly, in my view, a crime, a terrible crime.'

Mr Newman said the Russian president's presence at the summit was ultimately Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott's decision, but he felt he was speaking for Queenslanders.

Opposition Leader Bill Shorten echoed these views and says Mr Abbott should consider uninviting the Russian President from the Brisbane meeting over his government's 'reckless and stupid' actions leading up to the MH17 disaster.

Mr Abbott wouldn't comment on his stance regarding Mr Putin's attendance to the international gathering.

'For an outside nation to have supplied these Ukrainian rebels with this weaponry of war and murder is a very, very reckless and stupid act,' Mr Shorten said on Saturday.

'It is in the interests of resolving what has happened that all of the great powers, including the Russian Federation, support what was said at the United Nations Security Council last night.'

The council called for a thorough investigation of the crash.

Mr Shorten said the Australian government should consider barring Mr Putin from the upcoming G20 meeting in Brisbane if the country did not support the investigation.

'If the Russian Federation will not co-operate to help resolve and get to the heart of what has happened here, I don't think Australians would welcome them coming to the G20,' he said.

Sydney protesters are holding two anti-Putin protests on Saturday, calling for the Russian APresident to be banned from coming to Australia in November.
