Specially-trained US military dolphins are to be deployed to the Black Sea as tensions with Russia increase, it was claimed last night.

The US Navy’s marine mammal unit plans to send 30 dolphins and sea lions to take part in NATO drills in an area dominated by Russian forces.

Moscow-based newspaper Izvestia said the exercises, which could see American military dolphins nose-to-nose with their Russian counterparts, are expected to last for up to two weeks.

The Black sea has become a tense focal point for Russian and Western navies amid the current crisis in Ukraine.

Training mammals for naval operations including spying and mining of enemy ships began in the Cold War

Recently a low-flying Russian air force plane buzzed a U.S. warship sent to patrol here. 

The Ukrainian navy's warfare dolphins based in Sevastopol abruptly switched sides to Russia recently after Vladimir Putin's annexation of Crimea.

Training mammals for naval operations for spying on and mining of enemy ships began in the Cold War by both the U.S. and the USSR. 

'It may so happen that American and Russian military dolphins will meet in the open sea for the first time,' wrote Izvestia.

'It is known that such dolphins are trained only in Russia and the USA.'

The newspaper cited Tom LaPuzza, spokesman for the US Navy's marine mammals programme, as revealing that deployment of dolphins and sea lions was a first for NATO.

An ITAR TASS report evidently quoting LaPuzza stated that in the Black Sea the U.S. dolphins would test a new anti-radar which is designed to 'disorientate enemy sonars while sea lions would look for mines and naval divers'.

The U.S. is known to have trained dolphins and sea lions to identify intruders swimming in restricted areas, and the retrieve equipment lost at sea. 

It is understood some $14million (USD) is spent annually training the underwater mammals. They are also seen as skilled mine-finders by their military trainers.

The American Navy Marine Mammal Program found that dolphin sonar, known as echolocation, 'makes them uniquely effective at locating sea mines so they can be avoided and removed', according to one account.

After finding the mine, the dolphins signal the discovery to its crew by poking a ball with its nose.

It then is given a buoy line or acoustic transponder to mark the spot. 

America also trains 'attack sea lions' to detect and snare enemy divers. 

They are taught to attach spring loaded clamps to frogmen who are they pulled backwards through the water by the mammals' naval handlers on a vessel.

'It's difficult to put up effective resistance when you're being dragged backwards through the water,' LaPuzza has previously stated.  

Between 1986 and 1988 the U.S. Navy, which now has a fleet of at least 75 mine hunting dophins, deployed six on duties in the Persian Gulf. One, called Skippy, died of bacterial infection. 

Earlier, they were deployed in the Vietnam War. 

Uniquely, the U.S. has trained Beluga whales for deepwater operations.

Izvestia reported that the U.S. mammals would be flown in to Ukraine on planes equipped with special baths when the creatures are constantly watered. 

U.S. Air Force pictures show how they were transported to New Caledonia in 2009 for exercises off Australia. 

LaPuzza was quoted denying that the American sea animals are trained to attack people.

'On the contrary, as part of the training programme, they learn to save people. Their main activities are finding mines and divers.'

The Russian bottlenose dolphins - until recently under Ukrainian command - are trained to hunt for mines, plant bombs on hostile ships or attack enemy divers with special knives or pistols fixed to their heads. 

The use of dolphins as naval assets was begun during the Cold War in Sevastopol by the Soviet Union in 1973. 

With the collapse of the USSR, they were enlisted in the Ukrainian navy which last month lost its headquarters in Sevastopol after Russia's audacious land grab in Crimea.

The combat dolphins are now back under Kremlin control along with all 193 military units in the region.

'The military dolphins serving in Crimea will be transferred to the Russian Navy,' reported state-owned Russian news agency RIA Novosti at the time.

It was also disclosed Russia would invest more in the combat dolphin training programme.

'Engineers are developing new equipment for new programmes so that the dolphins can be used more effectively in underwater operations,' said a source.

'Our specialists have been working on new equipment that transform the dolphin's sonar signal at the point of detecting a submarine into a signal on the operator's screen.

'But the Ukrainian Fleet didn't have enough money to develop such know how and some projects had to be closed.'

While the dolphins show extraordinary intelligence, sometimes they disobeyed their Ukrainian commanders.

Last year three of five spy dolphins went absent without leave in the Black Sea - apparently in search of love, but returned to their duties shortly afterwards.

Yury Plyachenko, a former Soviet naval anti-sabotage officer, explained that this was something that had to be taken into account in working with the 007 mammals.

'If a male dolphin saw a female dolphin during the mating season, then he would immediately set off after her. But they come back in a week or so.'
