Leading U.S. CEOs, angered by
the Obama administration's challenge to certain 'workplace
wellness' programs, are threatening to side with anti-Obamacare
forces unless the government backs off, according to people
familiar with the matter.

Major U.S. corporations have broadly supported President
Barack Obama's healthcare reform despite concerns over several
of its elements, largely because it included provisions
encouraging the wellness programs.

The programs aim to control healthcare costs by reducing
smoking, obesity, hypertension and other risk factors that can
lead to expensive illnesses. 

A bipartisan provision in the 2010
healthcare reform law allows employers to reward workers who
participate and penalize those who don't.

Upset: Leading U.S. CEOs, angered bythe Obama administration's challenge to certain 'workplace wellness' programs, are threatening to side with anti-Obamacareforces

But recent lawsuits filed by the administration's Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), challenging the
programs at Honeywell International and two smaller
companies, have thrown the future of that part of Obamacare into
doubt.

The lawsuits infuriated some large employers so much that
they are considering aligning themselves with Obama's opponents,
according to people familiar with the executives' thinking.

'The fact that the EEOC sued is shocking to our members,' said Maria Ghazal, vice-president and counsel at the Business
Roundtable, a group of chief executives of more than 200 large
U.S. corporations. 

'They don't understand why a plan in
compliance with the ACA (Affordable Care Act) is the target of a
lawsuit," she said. 

'This is a major issue to our members.'

She then added, 'There have been conversations at the most senior levels of
the administration about this.'

Business Roundtable members are due to meet Obama in a
closed-door session on Tuesday, where they may air their
concerns.

It is not clear how many members of the group, whose
companies sponsor health insurance for 40 million people, are
considering any action. 

It is also not clear if the White House
can stop the EEOC from challenging wellness programs.

Obamacare allows financial incentives for workers taking
part in workplace wellness programs of up to 50 percent of their
monthly premiums, deductibles, and other costs. That translates
into hundreds and sometimes thousands of dollars in extra annual
costs for those who do not participate.

Typically, participation means filling out detailed health
questionnaires, undergoing medical screenings, and in some cases
attending weight-loss or smoking-cessation programs.

One of the arguments presented in the lawsuit against three
employers is that requiring medical testing violates the
Americans with Disabilities Act. 

The lawsuits are based on the view that it is no longer
voluntary if employees face up to $4,000 in penalties for
non-participation, loss of insurance or even their jobs.

Employers, however, see the lawsuits as reneging on the
administration's commitment to an important part of the
healthcare reform. 

In practical terms, large corporations have several ways to
undermine Obamacare if they decide to.

One is to support legal challenges to the subsidies given to
low-income individuals who buy health insurance on the federal
exchange established under the law. Neither the Business
Roundtable nor any of its CEO members have done this so far.

Another option is to make top executives available for
hearings on repealing or diluting Obamacare. 

'We never did this
before,' said the person familiar with the executives' thinking. 

'But they could turn up the noise. I don't think the White House
would want the CEOs turning on them and supporting these efforts
on the Hill.'

The nuclear option would be to radically change
employer-sponsored health insurance. Large corporations are
highly unlikely to eliminate it, but they might give workers a
fixed amount of money to buy coverage on a private insurance
exchange. 

That would allow employers, almost all of which pay
workers' medical claims out of their earnings, to cap their
healthcare spending.

Many CEOs are angry with the Obama administration thanks to three new cases challenging parts of his 'wellness program'

@highlight

In order to participate in the 'wellness program' and receive a low health care rate under Obamacare, employees must take a physical

Now it is being argued in three cases that forcing someone to take a physical for work violates the  Americans with Disabilities Act

The CEOs now have a number of ways they can undermine Obama because of this development
