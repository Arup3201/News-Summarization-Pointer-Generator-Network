A big question looming over James Corden's US chat show debut is: 'Will the audience get his humor?'

But it seems the first major hurdle facing the British comedian is whether some Americans even recognize him.

A spoof video released by CBS ahead of his first appearance on The Late Late Show on Monday depicts the funnyman trying to get back into the studios - but a security guard refuses.

The employee asks for Corden for an identification badge, but Corden is forced to explain he has just got back from lunch, while patting down his pockets. 

'I can't let you in without a badge,' the guard adds.

A frustrated Corden then starts arguing with the man, saying he is the host of the chat show and points to a huge poster of his face on the side of the building. 

The guard looks around, but he says: 'I don't see the resemblance'.

'What do you mean there is no resemblance?' Corden replies. 'It looks exactly the same as me. Do you know why? Because it is me'

The employee then realizes who he is talking to, but insists Corden still needs a badge to get in.

Reaching boiling point, Corden tries to muscle his way past the guard, but he gives up, throws his hands up in the air and says: 'I'm calling the building.' 

Corden is joined by Mila Kunis, Tom Hanks and Jay Leno on the sofa on Monday evening.

At one point Corden asks the employee: 'What do you mean there is no resemblance? It looks exactly the same as me. Do you know why? Because it is me?'
