Doctors have been left baffled after a Chinese pensioner woke from a two-week coma speaking perfect English - but not a word of her native language.

Liu Jieyu, 94, had been unconscious for a fortnight after suffering a stroke, which doctors had feared she may not recover from.

When she finally awoke, the retired teacher asked in perfect English: 'Where am I? What is happening?'

Surprised doctors were left even more confused when it became clear Ms Jieyu - who used to teach English - had lost all ability to speak her native Chinese.

An English-speaking doctor was brought in to talk to the pensioner, who confirmed she was speaking the language perfectly - although a little slowly.

Her shocked family say while Ms Jieyu had taught English previously, she had not spoken the language in more than 30 years.

They say said she had stopped using English after retiring to live with her family on the outskirts of the city of Changsha, in southern China's Hunan province.

Medic Tao Hou, 45,  said: 'I can't ever remember having a case like this before but we anticipate with proper rehabilitation and rest she should regain the ability to speak Chinese.

'We assume that the area dealing with her ability to speak Chinese has been damaged, but brain cells to have an ability to repair themselves to a certain extent we would hope to see at least some improvement.'

Ms Jieyu was admitted to hospital after suffering a type of stroke called a cerebral infarction, where the blood supply is limited rather than instantly cut off by a blockage.

The 94-year-old - who has not spoken English since she taught the language 30 years ago - has left doctors baffled

However, she is not the only person to wake up from a coma speaking another language.

Australian Ben McMahon woke up able to speak Mandarin after being involved in a car accident, while a 13-year-old Croatian girl woke up having replaced her fluency in her native language with speaking German. 

There was also the case of a U.S. navy veteran was found unconscious in a motel room who had no recollection of who he was and woke up speaking fluent Swedish. 

A Queensland Brain Institute neuroscientist suggested a possible explanation last year. 

Dr Pankaj Sah said the brain was made up of different circuits - which assist in language, breathing, speaking and thinking - similar to electronic circuits.

According to him, it is possible in Ben's case that the parts of the brain which recalled English were damaged in the crash and those that retained Mandarin were activated when the 22-year-old woke up.

Whether this is what happened to Ms Jieyu is not known. 

More commonly, people are known to have woken up with a different accent, like in the case of Kath Locket, who was born and bred in Stafford. 

But after she was rushed into hospital unable to speak or swallow, she developed a strong accent which was distinctly European. 

Foreign Accent Syndrome  is speech disorder that causes a sudden change to speech so that a native speaker is perceived to speak with a “foreign” accent. 

Foreign Accent Syndrome is most often caused by damage to the brain caused by a stroke or traumatic brain injury. 

Other causes have also been reported including multiple sclerosis and conversion disorder.

In some cases no clear cause has been identified.

Speech may be altered in terms of timing, intonation, and tongue placement, so that is perceived as sounding foreign.

Listeners can usually still understand the sufferer's speech; it does not necessarily sound disordered.

Foreign Accent Syndrome has been documented in cases around the world, including accent changes from Japanese to Korean, British English to French, American-English to British English, and Spanish to Hungarian.

There have only ever been 150 confirmed cases of Foreign Accent Syndrome in the world so far.
