Jackie McNamara last night backed the decision to let Virgil van Dijk play in Sunday’s League Cup final – but took a swipe at Celtic’s willingness to question the disciplinary system while matters were still pending.

Van Dijk will face United at Hampden after his red card was quashed – with Calum Butcher, the man the Dutch defender tangled with on the Tannadice turf – already cleared to play due to being the beneficiary of mistaken identity by linesman Graham Chambers.

But while the United boss welcomed the fact that - with the exception of Nadir Ciftci - neither of the two finalists will be hindered by suspensions, he believes Celtic’s readiness to question the loophole that got Butcher off the hook was inappropriate.

‘If you ask me, I would prefer that all the guys were playing – Nadir as well even though he picked up two yellows,’ McNamara said.

‘You want all of your best players to be playing in Cup Finals - you don’t want anyone to miss out.

‘I can understand the decisions. The two of them – Butcher and van Dijk were in a melee at that point but due to the loophole or rules, whether it’s right or wrong, that’s just the way it is.

‘I don’t think the whole thing is right. But again, it’s outwith my control. 

The Celtic defender went in hard on opposing player Callum Butcher at Tannadice

‘From our point of view, we have kept our silence and our focus on Sunday.

‘We haven’t mentioned anything about wanting anyone suspended or that this guy has done this or that.

‘We’re focused on our own team. The last thing I would want is for any of my players to speak out about the opposition and what-not when it’s been dealt with by the authorities. I’m pleased that they haven’t.’

The fall-out from the Scottish Cup quarter-final at Tannadice has threatened to overshadow the build-up to the first showpiece occasion of the season.

McNamara, for one, feels the myriad issues to come out of the spicy 1-1 draw on Tayside last weekend point towards the imminent introduction of video evidence.

‘I don’t think it would be a bad thing in certain instances. There’s got to be a real call for it,’ he added.

‘On Sunday, with the time it took them to make a decision, I think it would have been helpful.

‘But again, it’s affordability. Where do you draw the line in terms of games that are and aren’t on television?

‘The game has changed so much with the appeal system and tribunals. Video evidence … it seems to be going that way.’ 

Dundee United players appeal to the linesman after the clash in the Scottish Cup

Dundee United lost the Scottish Cup final to St Johnstone at the end of McNamara’s first season in charge.

Rank outsiders to upset Ronny Deila’s Treble-seeking side this weekend, the former Celtic star believes it’s imperative that his side maintain their discipline if they are to stand a chance of lifting the League Cup trophy.

‘I think that’s key to it,’ he continued.

‘It’s Celtic again, but you play most teams four times a season anyway and you get to know everybody really well throughout the campaign.

‘It shouldn’t come into play at all what happened last Sunday. I’ll make sure that the players understand the importance of discipline. We have to be committed, we have to compete, but first and foremost we have got to make sure we keep our cool.’

The second of four back-to-back games between the clubs this month spanning the three domestic competitions, McNamara believes that Celtic’s superior depth in squad is another factor in Deila’s favour this Sunday.

‘You could argue that (it’s easier for them) as they have the biggest squad in the league,’ he added.

‘But that’s not changed from the start of the season. We just have to make sure everybody is ready. In certain games I have moved players around, I have maybe made five or six changes in a game as I need everybody ready. Not just for one game, but for a full season. Sometimes it’s not worked and sometimes it has.’

McNamara had revealed how he has changed his squad’s routine this week, consciously making it a different experience to the build-up to last season’s Scottish Cup final.

Last year, the Tannadice squad were holed up in a plush St Andrews hotel for four nights whereas this week they have spent just one night there – with another overnight stay to come outside Edinburgh on Saturday.

‘We only went for one night this year – cost cutting!’ said McNamara with a smile. ‘The media day was our day for the players so we just decided to stay up after training and just settle them down. We wanted to make sure they were all relaxed and ready for Sunday.

‘There are certain things that we need to work on that I feel will help us if we want to win the match.’

Asked if, with the benefit of hindsight, he regretted some aspects of last year’ s preparations for the Scottish Cup final, McNamara replied: ‘No because that’s what I did at the time.

‘I don’t look at anything like that, what-ifs. I’m a great believer that things happen for a reason. I’m just delighted that, within a year, we find ourselves in another cup final.

‘That says a lot about what we have at our club, what we have in the dressing room, the mentality that we’re trying to instil into them. It’s something that Celtic have, the belief that they can go and do it.

‘The games that we’ve struggled in this season have been when we haven’t handled the expectation.

Against Celtic and Aberdeen, however, we have held our own. We’ve lost one, we’ ve won one with both teams. In other games, where we have been expected to win, we’ve fallen by the wayside.

‘That’s something we are building on. We’re getting closer, but we are still way apart on the consistency side of it. Last year, we won 16 league games. This year, we have won 14 already. So we’re getting there.’
