Last Friday afternoon, Lisa Hyder, a mother of six, called her ex-husband shortly after meeting a stranger in a Tennessee liquor store who offered her a ride home.

Just hours later, the 36-year-old woman was murdered, dismembered and partially cannibalized by suspected Satanist Gregory Scott Hale, according to police.

Three days after Hale's arrest on charges of premeditated first-degree murder and abuse of a corpse, new shocking details are beginning to emerge about the case that left a small Tennessee community reeling.

According to Lisa Hyder's ex-husband, Charles Hyder, the mother of their six children had struggled with alcoholism and was recently diagnosed with ovarian cancer, WZTV reported.

The woman lived in a Chattanooga suburb and worked in a store selling spirits in Manchester, where on Friday afternoon she ran into Gregory Hale.

At around 2.30pm, she called her ex-husband asking to pick her up, but he said he was in another town. He told her to wait for him, but when Mr Hyder returned home two hours later and called Lisa back, her phone was not answering.

Charles Hyder said he spent the weekend trying to reach his ex-wife so their children, the youngest of them just a year old, could talk to her like they did every day, but he could not get a hold of her.

‘I still blame myself because I didn't go get her, but I was down in Huntsville unloading my truck, and I wished I could have been there a little bit faster,’ Hyder said. ‘Usually I rescue her every time something goes wrong.’

Fate: Hyder, 36, called her ex-husband asking for a ride home after meeting Hale, but the man was away in another town and could not pick her up until two hours later

The couple were married for six years before splitting last year. The mother of six had a longstanding problem with alcohol and refused to get treatment for her cancer. But Charles Hyder said no matter what she had done, he loved her.

Lisa Hyder's family say they plan to push for a death penalty for her alleged killer.

‘My daughter was mangled, butchered and chopped up like a liver. There's nothing left,’ her heartbroken father, Billy Poore, told the station WAAY.

A clearer picture also has begun to emerge of the suspected killer and cannibal, Gregory Hale.

The 37-year-old was known among his neighbors and acquaintances as a devil worshiper.

He was reportedly fired from a meat processing plant after the owner caught him performing a satanic ritual.

The proprietor of the slaughterhouse recalled that Hale would often take animal bones and eyeballs home with him.

His Facebook page is filled with disturbing, sexually explicit and grisly images, as well as references to cannibalism and Scandinavian mythology. 

'Would tha vegetarian taste like that fake soy meat like they got in sum fast food places???' he wrote in April.

According to his social media account, the 37-year-old has a girlfriend and a teenage son named after a Norse god.

Some of Hale's selfies depict him brandishing weapons, including a large steel machete, or cradling snakes.

The 37-year-old also shared an image that featured a line of text that read: 'I hug the people I hate so I know how big to dig their hole in my backyard.'

Coffee County District 
Attorney Mickey Layne said Hale was apprehended at his home late Sunday 
after a neighbor told police he'd had a conversation with the 
37-year-old and had reason to believe a homicide had been committed.

When
 officers arrived at the home, Layne said they found human remains on 
the grounds. They then questioned Hale and took him into custody.

Hale has an attorney and is being held in jail on $1.5million bond. His next court date is June 23. 

Detectives believe the gruesome murder took place inside Hale's rural home on Pete Sain Road in Manchester Friday.

According
 to Hale's arrest affidavit, the suspect admitted to killing Lisa Hyder 
and then disposing of her body by beheading the victim and chopping off 
her hands and feet.

Officers who responded to Hale's residence after receiving a tip found at least two plastic buckets filled with human remains.

Hale buried the victim's torso in a burn pile on his property and consumed a part of the corpse, the document stated. 

Following his arrest, Hale told police he and Hyder did not know each other until they met in Manchester and went to the man's home, Times Free Press reported. 

The two were sitting around the fire and talking when the 37-year-old allegedly attacked and killed Hyder.

Gregory Hale offered investigators no motive for the brutal slaying and subsequent cannibalism.
