Officials say 11 people are safe after being rescued from their sinking tow boat carrying thousands of gallons of diesel fuel off the Hawaiian island of Oahu.

The Coast Guard says it received an emergency call on Thursday afternoon from the 95-foot Nalani after it began taking on water about 2 1/2 miles offshore.

Emergency vessels rushed toward the scene, while an alert went out for boats in the area to help with a rescue.

Spill: 75,000 gallons of diesel fuel are sinking beneath the water and an oil sheen was spotted in the ocean

Two vessels reached the stricken craft and brought all 11 people aboard to safety, later transferring them to a Coast Guard boat. No one was injured.

The Coast Guard says it was carrying 75,000 gallons of diesel fuel when it sank in 2,200 feet of water.

Crews are assessing what to do about the fuel. An oil sheen was spotted on the ocean.

The cause of the sinking was being investigated. 

'Right now, we're working with state and local partners as to how we're going to proceed on this," said Zachary Smith of the Coast Guard to Hawaii News Now. 

'We also contacted NOAA and requested an oil trajectory to where, if there's a release, where all this would make landfall.'

The Nalani was recently sold to tow the old Superferry barges to South America so the passengers prepared for a long journey. The length of travel was why there was so much fuel on board.
