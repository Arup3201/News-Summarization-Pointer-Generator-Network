The Navy SEAL who says he's being told to pay $4.5million for his book on the raid that killed Osama bin Laden is suing the lawyer who advised him before he published.

Matt Bissonnette filed suit against attorney Kevin Podlaski on Wednesday for $8million, claiming he was told that he did not need to submit the manuscript for his book No Easy Day to the Defense Department.

According to the lawsuit, Bissonnette has been forced to negotiate a settlement with the government. He may also face criminal charges for revealing classified information.

Lawsuit: Matt Bissonnette is suing the lawyer who advised him not to submit the manuscript of No Easy Day to the Department of Defense before publication

The Daily News reports that the lawsuit claims that Podlaski misled Bissonnette by giving him the impression that he had government clearance that allowed him to review classified material. 

'The task (Podlaski) purported to undertake for the benefit of plaintiff and his writing team was absolutely contrary to law and doomed to failure from the start,' the documents state.

He 'had no legal right to substitute his judgment for that of the Department of Defense or other agencies of the United States as to what is considered classified or otherwise sensitive information,' the lawsuit continues.

Bissonnette's current lawyer, Richard Luskin of the high-powered Washington firm Patton Boggs, told The Daily Beast that he reached a settlement with the Pentagon that's 'temporarily on hold.'

According to the lawsuit, Bissonnette's settlement gives up 'the majority of all income he has received from his book as well as all future income he otherwise would have received.'

It also figures lost income from Bissonnette's upcoming book, No Hero, along with forfeited movie rights and damage to his reputation.

'His reputation and his exemplary military record (have been) tarnished by the false accusation that he sought to profit from disclosure of classified or otherwise sensitive information,' the suit states.

Luskin has argued that Bissonnette has shown he takes the government's complaints seriously because he voluntarily stopped promoting No Easy Day and set aside royalties in anticipation of a settlement.

US officials have not yet confirmed a settlement. 

Bissonnette has faced his share of backlash from the SEAL community for the publication of No Easy Day, which he wrote under the pen name Mark Owen.

According to Bissonnette, his former SEAL Team 6 commanding officer made a fake tombstone with his name on it after No Easy Day.

Bissonnette later said that he texted this Navy captain that he never thought he was putting fellow soldiers at risk, and got back a text that read, 'Delete me.'

'They don’t call it SEAL Team 6-Year-Old for nothing,' Bissonnette said bitterly about that rejection.
