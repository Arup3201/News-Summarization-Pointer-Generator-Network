The challenging festive period is often a time in which Premier League titles can be won and lost.

With fixtures piling up and squads feeling the strain, the statistics show that some teams cope much better than others.

Here, Sportsmail delves into the most fascinating facts and stats from the Premier League Boxing Day fixtures of the past.

Manchester United are the kings of Christmas

When it comes to picking up three points on Boxing Day, Manchester United reign supreme having lost just one of their 22 fixtures (a 3-1 defeat against Middlesbrough in 2002).

With that impressive tally giving the Red Devils an 86.4 per cent Boxing Day win ratio, it's no wonder that the Old Trafford club have collected 13 Premier League trophies, often being known for hitting form during and after the festive period.

Arsenal are just behind Premier League rivals United with a 68.2 per cent win ratio having won 15 of their 22 Boxing Day clashes while drawing six and losing just once.

In third place are Liverpool who could do with some festive cheer after a difficult start to the 2014-15 Premier League season, but the Reds are without a Boxing Day victory since the departure of Rafael Benitez in 2010.

Walcott's goal against West Ham last season was his sixth on Boxing Day, the most of any current player

Everton and Aston Villa beware

Three of the 20 current Premier League teams are without a win on Boxing Day with Burnley, Hull and Swansea losing every single December 26 fixture they have played in.

Hull have never won in the Premier League on Boxing Day, and may not get a better chance than last year

However, as those three sides have played just seven top flight Boxing Day fixtures between them, we must look elsewhere to discover who may be dreading Friday afternoon the most.

Of the Premier League teams to have played over 19 Boxing Day fixtures, Aston Villa have recorded a disappointing 13.6 per cent win ratio with just three victories 22 fixtures making Paul Lambert's side the worst Boxing Day team in Premier League history.

Despite 22 years of top flight experience, Everton have picked up just six wins while drawing on seven occasions. 

Newcastle also seem to suffer from a Christmas hangover winning only 20 per cent of their Boxing Day games which doesn’t look like improving anytime soon with a visit to Old Trafford ahead of them.

Gareth Barry loves Boxing Day

Over the years, certain players seem to have a knack of popping up with vital festive goals for their teams. Robbie Fowler leads the way with eight goals scored for Liverpool and Manchester City between 1994 and 2004.

Thierry Henry and Robbie Keane were also masters of finding the net on December 26 with seven goals each during their time in the Premier League.

Of the stars still plying their trade in the Premier League, Arsenal's Theo Walcott tops the goalscoring list with six.

Everton midfielder Gareth Barry is the surprise name on our list, netting three times for Villa and once for City. With Mark Hughes' Stoke visiting Goodison Park on Friday, Barry will no doubt be looking to continue his festive form.
