FOUND: 16-year-old Layton Stone disappeared on August 22 while walking home from a friend's house in Kansas City, Missouri and was found yesterday in nearby Gardner, Kansas

A 16-year-old girl who went missing last week from her home in Missouri, has been found across the state line in Gardner, Kansas.

Layton Stone had her parents worried when she disappeared walking home from a friend's house on August 22.

They don't believe she ran away since she left behind her daily medication to prevent seizures and was looking forward to seeing her boyfriend graduate from basic training next week.

According to posts on the Find Layton Stone Facebook page, the teen was spotted in the northeast Kansas City area 'in the company of two "older" men.' 

An hour later, at 6pm Wednesday, another post said that Layton had been found in Gardner, Texas - about a 35 minute drive southwest of Kansas City.

'She is alive but no additional details are available at this time. Will update as soon as possible,' the moderator of the page wrote at 7pm. 

Layton Stone disappeared while walking home from a friend's house around 4:30pm on August 22.

She planned to stop and chat with another friend on her way home, but never appeared.

Family do not believe she ran away.

She did not have any money or identification on her, nor did she had the medication she takes every day to prevent seizures.

Layton and her family had recently moved to Kansas City from York, South Carolina.

She was looking forward seeing her boyfriend next week at his graduation from U.S. Air Force basic training in San Antonio. 

What happened? Layton went missing on this stretch of suburban road around 4:30pm on August 22

Search: Layton's parents don't believe she ran away. They say she did not have her seizure medication when she went missing

Plans: Layton was looking forward to visiting her boyfriend next week in Texas, at his graduation from basic training. Pictured above with someone who appears to be her boyfriend, in a picture posted to Facebook
