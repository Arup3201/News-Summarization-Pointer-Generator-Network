Newcastle’s Papiss Cisse has dedicated his point-saving double to cancer-suffering team-mate Jonas Gutierrez.

The Senegal striker came from the bench to rescue a 2-2 draw against Hull on Saturday.

Cisse had not played since breaking his kneecap in April, but has revealed that a phone call with Gutierrez on the eve of the game proved inspirational.

‘I spoke to Jonas (on Saturday night) and he told me to get a goal,’ said the 29-year-old, who also eased the pressure on manager Alan Pardew.

‘So those goals were for him - and the gaffer too.

‘But this man (Jonas) for me is a big man. My first goal in England it was him who gave me the cross.

‘I play for this man because the moments I have spent with him have been very nice.

‘He is a good person. He loves all the time, he smiles all the time. He is always happy.

‘That is why today I say “Jonas, life is not finished, keep going, this is just an obstacle. Thank you for everything”.

‘When I came on I thought maybe I could score one goal. But thank you God, I scored two and I’m happy.’

Pardew admits that Cisse was not fit enough to even be on the bench at the weekend after five months on the sidelines.

But the player was relieved to get the nod.

‘It’s been a long time,’ he said after netting twice in 14 minutes. ‘But I came back, scored two goals, and this was my day.

‘I just started training last week. But when I saw my name in the squad the gaffer said he was putting me on the bench.

‘I wasn’t scared – I was just happy, I said in my head “oh, I’m coming back to play football”.

‘I thank everyone who has supported me through the past five months. They have kept me smiling.

‘I just keep going. Last year was hard for me. But that’s football. It can change in a day.

‘So I always work hard and believe in myself.’
