Former President Bill Clinton hit back at critics as he defended his foundation's acceptance of foreign donations before warmly welcoming Russian female punk band Pussy Riot onstage.

Bill spoke during the Clinton Global Initiative University on Saturday in Florida, where he discussed the receipt of donations from foreign governments that were accepted while the former first lady served in the State Department and after she departed in early 2013.

He pointed to the track record of his global philanthropy as Hillary Rodham Clinton nears an announcement on a 2016 presidential campaign.

Later in the day, he was joined by musicians Maria Alekhina and Nadezdha Tolokonnikova who were detained in 2012 for staging a protest in one of Moscow's largest cathedrals. 

The women, who advocate for gender, LGBT and human rights, were convicted for extremism but were released several months short of their two-year sentence in December 2013.

They were a part of the eight annual conference that focuses on education, environment and climate change, peace and human rights, poverty alleviation and public health.

Bill told moderator Larry Wilmore of the cable channel Comedy Central: 'My theory about all of this is disclose everything and then let people make their judgments.

'I believe we have done a lot more good than harm and I believe this is a good thing.'

He spoke shortly after Hillary appeared on stage along with the couple's daughter, Chelsea Clinton, but steered clear of addressing criticism involving her use of a private email account while she served as secretary of state under President Barack Obama. 

Hillary also did not talk about the recent scrutiny of the foundation's fundraising practices, instead giving college students a preview of an upcoming report on the progress of women and girls by her foundation's 'No Ceilings' project.

On the donations flap, Bill noted that some of the foundation's money has come from Middle Eastern nations, referencing to donations from the United Arab Emirates.

'Do we agree with everything they do? No. But they're helping us fight ISIS,' he said. 

Bill said he did not agree with the entire foreign policy of Saudi Arabia, another donor, but he pointed to its construction of the kingdom's first coeducational institution.

He said the foundation has received donations from more than 300,000 people since its inception. 

'You've got to decide when you do this work whether it will do more good than harm if someone helps you from another country,' he said.

In recent days, Hillary has faced criticism over her use of a private email account while she was secretary of state. 

The disclosures have raised questions over whether she complied with federal rules requiring government officials to retain written communications involving official business.

Clinton has requested her emails to be released and the State Department is reviewing the 55,000 pages of emails she has already turned over, and congressional Republicans are investigating.

Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Short said Hillary had spent the past week 'hiding from the press and voters' and that it was 'clear that she feels the rules that every other American lives by don't apply to her, and today's failure to answer these questions did nothing to allay any of these concerns.'

Obama commented publicly on the email controversy for the first time Saturday, telling CBS News that he first heard about the private account through news reports.

He also said that he was glad Hillary had 'instructed that those emails about official business need to be disclosed.' 

When asked how the dust up squared with his administration's push for transparency, Obama said Hillary's decision to put them forward 'will allow us to make sure that people have the information they need.'

Bill said he did not agree with the entire foreign policy of Saudi Arabia, another donor, but he pointed to its construction of the kingdom's first coeducational institution

Republicans have also assailed the Clinton Foundation's receipt of donations from foreign governments, saying it could create a conflict of interest for the former first lady if she is elected president.

Hillary is building a campaign team and remains the leading Democratic presidential contender if she enters the 2016 campaign. 

Her appearance at the University of Miami brought her before an audience of around 1,000 college students in one of the nation's top presidential battleground states and was only a short drive from the home of a potential Republican rival, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.

Pointing to her upcoming 'No Ceiling' report, Hillary said 'unfinished business' remained in the educational and economic opportunities of women and girls and she would speak in detail about it next week in New York. 

She said she plans to black out her social media profile images on Sunday to take part in a program called 'Not There' to raise awareness about gender inequality.
