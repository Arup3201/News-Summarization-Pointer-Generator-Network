Don't expect Barry Geraghty to turn into the green-eyed monster looking at colleague’s rides any time soon – there is no need.

Lining up for the 35-year-old Irishman in the coming weeks should be his 2013 Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Bobs Worth, King George VI Chase favourite Simonsig and recuperating 2013 Champion Chase winner Sprinter Sacre.

Geraghty also has an enthusiastic eye on future talent.

Geraghty is looking ahead to racing up and coming horses including Beat That and Vaniteux

That’s why missing riding Jezki, his Champion Hurdle winner in March, on his return to action against Hurricane Run in Saturday's Morgiana Hurdle at Punchestown and More Of That, his World Hurdle winner, in the Long Distance Hurdle at Newbury later this month, will not spark a hint of a tantrum.

Geraghty said: ‘I can’t say I am overly envious of anyone. I got a great ride from More Of That and Jezki last season. They are two horses you’d like to ride but I hope to have two young horses to step up and snap at their heels in Beat That and Vaniteux.

‘Beat That was a frame of a horse last year and did well to win at Punchestown and Aintree. He should improve a lot physically. The hope is that he will be a World Hurdle Hurdle horse. More Of That sets the standard but he should have a shout.’

Geraghty’s aspirations for Vaniteux, third in the Supreme Novices’ Hurdle in March, will be tested when he carries top weight of 11st 12lb in tomorrow’s Greatwood Hurdle.

Geraghty said: ‘Even though he has top weight, his handicap mark is reasonable. He has pace but he doesn’t lack physique – he is very strong.’

Geraghty rides Oscar Whisky for his boss Nicky Henderson in Saturday afternoon’s Paddy Power Gold Cup, a race he won in 2002 on Cyfor Malta.

The three-time Grade One winner has not yet matched best hurdles form when chasing but Geraghty feels he knows the key.

The rider said: ‘The big thing is to get him into a rhythm jumping. If he does, he has a big chance.’

Geraghty’s Open Meeting got off to a good start on Friday, easily landing the Grade Two Hyde Novices’ Hurdle on John Ferguson-trained 10-1 Parlour Games.

The six-year-old, now the same odds to the Neptune Investment Novices’ Hurdle at the Festival in March, showed a classy turn of foot, hardly surprising given he won the 2011 Melrose Stakes at York and his dam is 2000 Irish Oaks winner Petrushka. 

BHA and Cheltenham will not change the start time of the Paddy Power Gold Cup, despite fears it could be disrupted by low sunlight. Only 10 of the 16 obstacles were jumped in Friday's novices’ chase won by Champagne West which started at 2.25pm. Today’s race is off at 2.30pm.

Spokesman Robin Mounsey said the chance of a problem was ‘low risk’ but BHA will hope to avoid an embarrassing hat-trick. Two weeks ago the Charlie Hall Chase at Wetherby was run over the wrong distance. Last week’s Badger Beer Chase at Wincanton was ‘won’ by ineligible entry The Young Master, subsequently disqualified.
