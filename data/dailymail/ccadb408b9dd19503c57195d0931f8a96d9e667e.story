Former Newcastle Knights player Alex McKinnon has been released from hospital after seven months of rehabilitation from a devastating injury that left him in a wheelchair.

McKinnon's career ended in March with a tackle gone wrong in a round three match against Melbourne Storm.

The 22-year-old has posted an image on his Instagram account with his fiancee Teigan outside the Royal Rehab hospital in Sydney.

McKinnon will now continue his rehabilitation at his home in Newcastle.

In a separate post last month, the 22 year old  said he was not dwelling on the accident, and was instead thinking about a new career path.

'Yes rugby league was my drive before thought my real drive in life is just to succeed & if that be in a new career that that I will do!'

On July 20, McKinnon returned to the Newcastle home ground, Hunter Stadium, for the first time since he was injured.

He came onto the field in front of a near-capacity crowd for what was deemed the Rise for Alex Round, a dedication to  McKinnon which also aimed to raise money for the players medical expenses.

The near capacity stadium erupted in Cheers when McKinnnon appeared on the field.

'As much as I would love to get home and get back to my family and get back to Newcastle and get on with my life, I want to walk again,' McKinnon said on the night of his appearance.

'You see a lot of stories about people who get on with their lives and don't walk again. My focus is to get as much back of my movement as I can and I am slowly improving.

McKinnon says the progress that he has already made is a positive sign for the future.
