Disney has announced that they will be making their first British production, teaming up with the company who made The Only Way Is Essex to create a four-part mystery adventure.

The media giant will be working on their first ever British non-animated film to created a movie event with Bafta award-winning Lime Pictures, the production team behind Hollyoaks and TOWIE.

The movie event, called 'Evermoor', will be made in the UK, and broadcast on the flagship U.S. Disney channel.

Media Giant: Disney will be teaming up with the British company for the first time to produce a four-part series called 'Evermoor', mixing a U.S. family with a UK setting

Billed as a mystery adventure, 'Evermoor' will follow American teenager Tara Bailey, who has been uprooted from her U.S. home and sent abroad to England.

She arrives in an isolated village named Evermoor, on the edge of creepy moors in middle England.

As her mother and stepfather are busy unpacking, Tara and her siblings try to adjust to their new home.

But soon they are faced with danger and have to unite to save their new home, and their family’s new start in England.

Tricia Wilber, chief marketing officer at The Walt Disney Company Europe and Middle East and Africa, said the film was the organisation’s 'most ambitious production yet'.

David Levine, the company’s vice president for programming and production, said: 'Evermoor is a hugely exciting project for the team, with a gripping story that I’m sure will captivate our global Disney Channel audience.'

Claire Poyser, managing director for Lime Pictures, said: 'We are delighted to be the first independent production company in the UK to work with Disney on a live action movie to be aired worldwide including the US.

'Evermoor extends Lime’s reputation for producing fantastic children’s drama that is inspiring for the whole family.'

The film is set to be aired in 160 countries across the world from autumn this year.
