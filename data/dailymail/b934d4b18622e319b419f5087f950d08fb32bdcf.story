It must be tough for supporters of Sheffield Wednesday to come to Manchester City. Historically, these clubs were equals, northern football powerhouses with roots and popularity sunk deep in the working-class culture of the industrial age.

In the modern era, though, Wednesday know they can never ever be City’s equal again. UEFA’s Financial Fair Play rules have seen to that.

City secured their new-found status on the back of Middle East cash just before Michel Platini and his friends slammed the door shut on everybody else.

So this is, to an extent, all that is left for clubs such as Wednesday, afternoons when they travel in hope and pray for a brief reminder of what life was like when their team were in the top division and their magnificent stadium hosted FA Cup semi-finals and matches in the European Championship.

Thankfully, football still provides an occasional avenue for dreams and glory, so on Sunday they poured over the Pennines in their thousands to support Stuart Gray and his team.

The odds and the mathematics were against them. Having lost 7-0 here to City in the Capital One Cup as recently as September, Wednesday required an eight-goal swing to go through.

Remarkably, they looked as though they may do it for a while. There were 51 minutes between Atdhe Nuhiu’s terrific opening goal and James Milner’s equaliser. In the away end, they enjoyed every one of them.

Ultimately, it wasn’t to be. A merited draw and a replay beckoned but the depth of City’s squad eventually hauled them through and sent Wednesday home with nothing.

The impact of City substitutes Samir Nasri and David Silva could not be ignored and Milner’s toe-end in the second minute of injury-time gave City a victory they barely deserved.

‘I am relieved,’ said their manager Manuel Pellegrini afterwards. ‘We played very badly but we found another gear in the last 20 minutes.The FA Cup means a lot. We will try to win it.

‘I have said before what I think about James Milner. He is very useful. He always plays with 100 per cent commitment and intensity. I am very happy for him and also as it’s his birthday.’ Given the manner in which City had struggled for consistent superiority in recent Barclays Premier League games here against Burnley (2-2) and Sunderland (3-2), Gray perhaps felt that if Wednesday could grab something early then it would at least make for an interesting afternoon. That is exactly what happened.

The move ahead of the opening goal was started by central midfielder Kieran Lee in the 15th minute as he played a lovely, purposeful ball down the right flank into the path of the breaking Stevie May.

With only big centre forward Nuhiu in the penalty area, the chances of a breakthrough still appeared slim but the Austrian dropped off intelligently as he anticipated a low cross, and when the ball arrived he side-footed it confidently to Willy Caballero’s left and into the net.

Behind the goal at the other end of the stadium, they celebrated vigorously. Their team were ahead. This is what they had come for.

If City were not exactly stunned, they were unsettled. For a while their discipline and composure deserted them as they railed at referee Michael Oliver in response to some of his decisions.

Sometimes they appeared to have a point and at others they didn’t, but by losing discipline City only played into Wednesday’s hands.

Wednesday rarely looked like breaking through again but nor did a City goal feel imminent, either. Fernando should have done better than head a corner over when unmarked in the 21st minute, while Yaya Toure and Frank Lampard drove low shots wide.

Ultimately, City had to wait until the 66th minute for their equaliser and when it came it owed much to the substitutions made just a few minutes earlier.

One replacement, Nasri, began the move with a ball inside to another, Silva, on the left side. And when Silva made a cute pass inside the full back to play Milner in on the angle, the England midfielder was smart enough to find the gap between Chris Kirkland’s legs and thus the far corner.

After that, the traffic all moved one way and Wednesday could only try to hang on.

A save from Kirkland to deny Silva in the first minute of injury-time seemed set to earn Wednesday a replay. Then one more raid to the byline from the energetic Jesus Navas saw the winger find Milner inches ahead of a sea of yellow, and his touch sent City into round four and Wednesday back to the reality of life in the Championship.

‘I thought we had a replay against the champions,’ said Gray. ‘But City showed us respect by sending on Silva and Nasri and tired minds cost us in the end. I am very proud of the players.’
