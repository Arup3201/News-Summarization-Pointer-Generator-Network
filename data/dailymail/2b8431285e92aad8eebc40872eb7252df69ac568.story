A popular pie eating competition had to be declared void – after the wrong-sized pies were delivered to the venue.

A work experience chef was blamed for sending pies twice the official size to the Wigan Pie Eating Contest, held at Harry's Bar in the town.

Meanwhile, the competition pies were delivered to a nearby party being held by someone celebrating their divorce.

Champion scoffer: Barry Rigby, 37, a warehouse supervisor, won in a time of just 42.6 seconds

The contest went ahead anyway, with former champion Barry Rigby, 37, a warehouse supervisor, setting a time of 42.6 seconds.

But it was for only half a pie after umpires decided that consumption of a full pie could result in a dangerous 'swallow stall'. 

Tony Callaghan, owner of Harry's Bar, said: 'The work experience lad was tasked with providing 24 competition pies, but mixed up the order and sent them to divorce party up the road. 

'By the time we realised, it was too late.'

Mr Callaghan added: 'We had to go ahead. It was a bit like Andy Murray replacing Roger Federer for a show game at the tennis finals in the O2, but everyone took it in their stride and demonstrated the professionalism of pie-eating at this level.

'It was a shame, because these lads practise long and often: you can see how seriously they take it, practising pie-eating late into the night on every street corner in Wigan town centre.'

Dedicated athletes: Participants take part in a heat. They are eating half pies, after the trainee chef given the job of delivering the pies to the competition accidentally brought along snacks of the wrong size

Safety first: The pies had to be halved to cut the chances of a dangerous 'swallow stall' 

The cooked dimensions of the official competition pie should be a diameter of four-and-three-quarter inches and a depth of one-and-a-third inches, and a pie wall angle from base to top of between zero and 15 degrees.

Minimum content cube dimensions of the meat and potato mix are two-fifths of an inch, and they must have 66 per cent meat content, not including pastry.
