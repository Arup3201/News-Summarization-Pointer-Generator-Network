Newcastle have turned around their dismal start to the season by winning their last four Premier League games in a row to rise to eighth in the table.

Fans' unrest over manager Alan Pardew's tenure has quietened, but recent results do not disguise was has been a disastrous year in terms of results. We asked The Mag's Mark Jenson his views on where the jury stands Pardew.

We all know that the prime reason for Newcastle United’s existence, is that the club supplies regular entertainment for the rest of the country, journalists especially.

In that respect, NUFC rarely ever let anybody down.

The club has regularly been referred to as a soap opera but I think circus is a more fitting description much of the time, though that doesn’t necessarily then make all of the fans to be clowns.

Alan Pardew has turned things around at St James' Park, but recent results cannot disguise a terrible year

The Newcastle supporters haven’t even been left in peace by the wider population to enjoy this surprising, but very welcome, run of five wins in a row. Apparently we are fickle because we didn’t like getting beat every week and now like it when we win a few matches.

Meanwhile, without any criticism from the ‘experts’, Liverpool fans call for Brendan Rodgers’ head, only a dozen Premier League matches since he came within a whisker of winning the title.

Similarly, every season Arsenal fans call for Arsene Wenger’s head whenever they fail to win two matches in a row, the Gooners having to put up with only Champions League football for the hundredth season in a row.

There is a lot of talk about whether Alan Pardew has ‘proved’ everybody wrong, though obviously what they are really referring to here is the body of Newcastle fans who finally snapped and vocally/visibly, called for change.

Accusations of fickleness?

Newcastle fans showed unbelievable restraint when they watched their team win only five Premier League matches in ten months from Boxing Day 2013.

The record of all Premier League matches over the course of 2014 (above) reads like this for Newcastle fans, this is what we have ‘enjoyed’ from the turn of the year.

It was not too long ago that the Newcastle faithful was calling for their manager to be sacked

For those of you good at maths, if you knock the recent run of four Premier League wins out of four off these stats, you get won 5, drawn 5 and lost 16. With 21 goals scored and 49 against.

Alan Pardew might be showing Champions League form over the last few matches but the end of the season is the only time to judge what kind of job has been done at any club.

Newcastle United are the third best supported club in the country and a constant in the top seven Premier League turnovers.

Recent results have been buoyed by striker Ayoze Perez who has scored three in his last three games

Anything less than seventh each season is failure for me and Newcastle are currently standing eighth place in the Premier League.

Fans will always support the players who wear the shirt but respect for the manager has to be earned.

Alan Pardew has made a start in reclaiming that respect but he had better keep pedalling if he is going to inspire confidence longer term.
