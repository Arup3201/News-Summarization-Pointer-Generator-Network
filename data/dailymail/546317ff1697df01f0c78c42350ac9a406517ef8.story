'80% sure it's him': The body of a Western man who slashed his throat in a Cambodian lodging house is believed to be fugitive Stuart Green who is accused of murdering a young woman, believed to be a prostitute known as Nari (above)

The body of a Western man who slashed his throat with a shard of glass in a Cambodian lodging house is believed to be fugitive British murder suspect Stuart Green, police said today.

Green, 47, was earlier reported to have been arrested after being on the run following the discovery of the body of a naked woman under a bed with her throat slashed in another cheap hotel in Phnom Penh.

But in a dramatic development today, police said the foreign national found dead in a cheap flop house - doss house - was believed '70 to 80 per cent' to be that of Stuart Green from Eccles, Greater Manchester.

Municipal police official Mom Sitha told the Phnom Penh Post that the body was found without identification in the lodgings in Phnom Penh's Daun Penh district.

He had apparently smashed a window, then used a shard of glass to cut his own throat - a macabre replay of the savage death of the young woman whose throat had been cut and who had suffered other stabbing injuries around her neck.

Mr Sitha said police were reasonably certain that the dead man was Green, but no passport or other identity papers were found in the room.

'The dead foreigner, we suspect 70 to 80 per cent, that it is Green,' he said.

Police said the dead man was believed to be 'a little over 30 years of age' which would make him much younger than Green's 47 years.

The owner of the lodging house told local media that the Western man had taken up occupancy of room 304 on the second floor at 3am on January 5 after a friend of his, who was not staying there, had rented the room for him.

On the morning of January 6, local media reported, the guesthouse owner and cleaning staff became worried that they had not seen the man emerge from his room the day after he had checked in.

When they went to the room, they found the door bolted and a mattress had been stood up against the keyhole to prevent anyone looking in.

The owner forced his way in and found the foreign man lying on the bed.

It is not known who the friend is who checked the man into the room.

Stuart Green had originally checked into the £12-a-night Bolyna Palace Hotel in Phnom Penh with a woman - believed to be a prostitute known as Nari, although she has yet to be formally identified - on Christmas day.

Late at night on December 28 Green came down from his room to the reception desk and asked for the return of his passport - customarily kept until the bill was paid - because he needed it to draw money from a bank.

Even though no banks were open at that time of night, about 11pm, the passport was returned and Green walked out, never to return.

The following day the naked body of the young woman was found under the bed with her throat cut. Police began a search for Green in the city and ordered border posts to watch for him in case he tried to leave the country.

Earlier this week, a writer on an expatriatre forum insisted that Green had been arrested and later gave details that police had picked him up at a local market.

The writer said Green, who always wore sunglasses, had been seen several times in the city - particularly near the market - since the discovery of the woman's body and he was surprised that he had been able to move around so freely.

If Green was not arrested, but had cause to suspect police were closing in on him, it might explain his arrival at a flop house in the early hours of the morning, expatriates speculated today.

Green, who was said to have overstayed his visa and was desperately short of cash, was also described as being hooked on crystal meth as was the woman he was suspected of murdering.

The British Embassy said it was not able to comment and police said they were still trying to confirm the identity of the dead man.
