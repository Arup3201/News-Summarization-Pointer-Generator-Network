Former US Open champion Juan Martin del Potro admitted he had to think of his long-term future after pulling out of the Australian Open with a recurrence of a wrist injury.

Del Potro returned from 10 months out of the game at the Sydney International earlier this week, but since bowing out in the quarter-finals to Mikhail Kukushkin has felt pain in his wrist.

And the 26-year-old Argentinian, who won his sole grand slam title to date at Flushing Meadows in 2009, said he did not feel ready to play five-set matches in the first grand slam of the year in Melbourne.

'It's been hurting the last couple of days and weeks,' he said. 'Nothing new, nothing dangerous. But I think my wrist is not ready for play in this important tournament.

'I have to be smart. I'm looking forward to my future and my career. I'm still positive. I want to play tennis but I don't want to put my body and wrist at risk.

'I think it was a tough decision, but it could be a smart decision if I want to stay healthy and play for the whole year. I have to be smart and see more than my present now. I have to do what the doctor says.

'I really enjoyed playing tennis again in Sydney, winning a couple of matches. I didn't expect that for sure. But that's given me a little bit of motivation for getting through this pain again.'

Del Potro said he would consult with his doctor before deciding when he might be able to compete again, adding: 'I want to stay calm a few days, then see the doctor, see what's going on with my plan.'
