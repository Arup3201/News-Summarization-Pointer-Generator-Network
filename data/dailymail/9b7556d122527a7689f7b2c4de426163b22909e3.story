A giant portrait of a young man's face made entirely from dirt and sand has taken over Washington's National Mall.

The striking artwork, which can apparently be seen from space, is a staggering six acres in size and required 2,500 tons of sand and 800 tons of topsoil in materials.

Cuban-American artist Jorge Rodriguez-Gerada created the piece as a compilation of American faces after photographing 30 young men on the National Mall this year.

The piece is entitled 'Out of Many, One,' the English translation of E pluribus unum from the U.S. seal. It is the first such public artwork commissioned by the National Portrait Gallery.

The artwork can be viewed from the Washington Monument or visitors can walk along the portrait’s features. At ground level, the artist said it's like a zen garden. 

Rodriguez-Gerada said he set out to create one of millions of possible faces of America, and he felt young men between the ages of 18 and 25 need to be embraced.

The artwork does not represent a particular race, he said, but was a compilation of faces that were black, brown and white.

'Diversity is the backbone that makes this country great,' he said. 'This is a great way of celebrating that.'

The artist used GPS technology to mark 10,000 points with tiny pegs on an empty field and then linked them with twine to create precise lines for the portrait made of dirt.

Rodriguez-Gerada has created similar pieces in the past in Amsterdam, Belfast and Barcelona, including an image of President Barack Obama.

The soil and sand - all of which was donated - will eventually be reused to improve the National Mall's turf, park officials said. By November, the portrait will start to disappear.

'A lot of my work is ephemeral,' Rodriguez-Gerada said, 'because I want to talk about living in the moment.'
