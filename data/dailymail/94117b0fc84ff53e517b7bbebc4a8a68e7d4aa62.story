Lance Armstrong says he believed he is living a 'positive and free' life after confessing to using performance-enhancing drugs.

The disgraced cyclist told CNN that he has been able to go about his daily life without being taunted or heckled for what he did.

A cancer survivor and once hero to millions, Armstrong was stripped of his seven Tour de France victories and banned for life from racing in 2012 by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency after it accused him in a report of engineering one of the most sophisticated doping schemes in sports.

The investigation and later admission to doping destroyed Armstrong`s reputation and career.

Time for reflection: Lance Armstrong is living an unbothered and positive life 18 months after confessing to using performance-enhancing drugs

'I never get crap, not once, and I`m surprised by that,' Armstrong told CNN.

'Sure, I sometimes get the vibe that someone wants to say something but it`s never happened.'

The Armstrong lies along with the bullying and the betrayal has laid him bare to all manner of abuse.

The cyclist`s problems are far from over however. He and his team of lawyers are about to face several civil lawsuits that could drain the fortune gained. 

In June a federal judge rejected Armstrong`s bid to dismiss a whistleblower lawsuit claiming that he and his former cycling team, which the U.S. Postal Service had sponsored, defrauded the government in a scheme to use banned, performance-enhancing drugs.

Armstrong claims the U.S. Postal Service benefitted hugely from the exposure it got from its sponsorship and that the lawsuit had been brought too late.

Toughing it up: He admits to having an 'f-you' attitude, but the disgraced cyclist insists he 'never gets crap' from people following his long-awaited admission of long-term doping

The lawsuit has potential $100 million ramifications for a man who was previously one of the world's most bankable sports stars.

'I'm very confident that that's a winner for us,' he says. 'I don't think anyone can truly argue the U.S. Postal Service was damaged. They made a lot of money in the deal and got what they bargained for.

'I`m very confident that that`s a winner for us,' said Armstrong. 'I don`t think anyone can truly argue the U.S. Postal Service was damaged.

'They made a lot of money in the deal and got what they bargained for.

'I worked my ass off for them and I`m proud of it. Furthermore there wasn`t a technical relationship between myself and the U.S. Postal Service.'

Armstrong relishes a good fight. He claims it's what made him a great cyclist.

'I definitely have a 'f-you' attitude,' he says. 'I fight in training, I fight to win races, I fight to motivate the guys in the team.

Bleak outlook: There's no hope of him ever riding competitively again and he is facing civil lawsuits to the tune of tens of millions of dollars

The list of those he hurt, and who won't forgive him, is long: three-time Tour winner Greg LeMond; journalist David Walsh, who spent more than a decade trying to expose Armstrong; and former friends Frankie and Betsy Andreu, to name a few.

A number have asked whether his public mea culpa on Oprah was genuine and if he needs to do more. 

'That's a difficult one for me to answer,' he says. 'You can't do justice in a one-hour conversation. It was a situation for a lot of people that it was too much information, but for other people - cycling fans, sports fans, for other parts of the population - it wasn't enough, I didn't go far enough.'

Armstrong says he's sorry in conversation repeatedly but, at the same time, he knows it doesn't matter to many people. 'I don't blame anyone for thinking, 'I don't trust this guy with all his b*****t for 10 years,' ' he adds.

In some ways it is as if Lance Armstrong is trying to rebuild his tattered reputation and although he will never be welcomed back into cycling society,mixed with presidents or Hollywood movie stars, he claims he is still friends with many.

Reboot: Armstrong hopes to restart his charity work, undergo a course of therapy andsays he is planning on writing a book where he will 'put it all out there'

There even friends who stopped ringing or answering his calls but he is adamant it is not part some PR campaign.

 Armstrong says he has big plans for the future including rebooting his original cancer foundation, and he says he wants to write a third book which won't have anything to do with cycling.

'I need to write a book and it needs to be pretty raw. I need to put it out there and let it sit. The sooner the better. It has to be the right book, the right tone and there has to be totally no b-s.' 

He says that he sees writing as a kind of therapy that will help see him through the next few years. He says he is 'fully committed to putting it all out there.'

If that's the case, a good many of his former fans are wondering, what don't we yet know?
