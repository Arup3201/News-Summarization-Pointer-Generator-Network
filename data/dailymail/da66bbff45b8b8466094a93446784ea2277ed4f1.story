It was a reckless prank that could easily have ended in tragedy.

This shocking video footage captures a smiling young girl on a moving train, who - encouraged by her laughing friends - sticks her head out of the window and straight into the path of another speeding train approaching from the opposite direction.

With her entire head out of the window she grins widely for the camera - despite the train hurtling towards her at top speed - before ducking back inside the carriage at the last possible second as it whips past.

Reckless: The girl smiles for her friend's camera as the oncoming train speeds straight towards her

At the start of the video, a young man can clearly be heard telling the girl: 'Stick your head out'.

She immediately complies, removing her sunglasses and smiling into the lens of the camera as the train is seen bearing down behind her.

The front of the train appears to be just inches from the girl's head when at last she pulls it back inside.

Had she hesitated even a fraction of a second longer, the young girl would surely have been beheaded as the speeding vehicle crossed paths with the train she was travelling on.

Shaken: The girl appears visibly shaken by her near-miss as she sits on the floor of the train carriage

After she whips her head back inside the carriage the other young people on board can be heard laughing and asking the girl if she is okay, while she sits on the floor with her hand over her mouth repeating: 'Oh my God, oh my God'.

Despite the giggles and laughter, the girl appears visibly shaken by her near-miss, footage of which was posted on YouTube.

More than 4,000 people have watched the 30-second video clip of the girl's dangerous prank.

The young people seen and heard in the clip would appear to be American.
