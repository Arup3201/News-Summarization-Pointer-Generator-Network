While the Occupy Wall Street movement has collected 
support from the likes of Michael Moore, Susan Sarandon and rapper 
Jay-Z, not all in Hollywood circles are sympathetic.

Tough talk: Frank Miller, the writer and director of Sin City ranted at the Occupy Wall Street to 'go back to your mommas¿ basements and play with your Lords Of Warcraft'

Frank
Miller, writer and director of Sin City, likened the occupiers to 
'thieves,' 'rapists' and 'losers' in a blog post last week.

Miller
wrote: 'In the name of decency, go home to your parents, you losers. Go
back to your mommas’ basements and play with your Lords Of Warcraft.'

'Or better yet, enlist for the real thing. Maybe our military could whip some of you into shape.'

Meanwhile, protesters are facing off with authorities across the country as officers step up pressure against the demonstrators.

In Portland, police in riot gear Sunday surrounded demonstrators in a downtown park area after hundreds of people defied the mayor's order to leave the park by midnight.

By early afternoon, officers had mostly surrounded the camp where the protesters were holding a "general assembly" meeting to discuss their next moves following the eviction order.

Some officers used nightsticks to push people away from the encampment and used loudspeakers to warn that anyone who resisted risked arrest and 'may also be subject to chemical agents and impact weapons.'

Demonstrators chanted 'we are a peaceful protest.'

Police could be seen carrying at least one protester away from the park. Another man was taken away on a stretcher; he was alert and talking to paramedics, and raised a peace sign to fellow protesters, who responded with cheers.

There was no immediate word on arrests.

Protester Mike Swain, 27, told The Associated Press: 'We were talking about what we were going to do and then they just started hitting people. Seems like a waste of resources to me.'

At one point the numbers swelled to thousands but then started to thin in the early morning hours.

Protest organizers in Portland said they hope enough people will join them to make it difficult if not impossible for police to carry through on any eviction.

'Occupy the street,' one organizer said through a bull horn. 'Remain peaceful and aware. We have strength in holding the streets.'

Mayor Sam Adams had ordered the camp shut down, citing unhealthy conditions and the encampment's attraction of drug users and thieves.

Police numbers shifted throughout the night, but they showed no signs of moving against the protesters.

Around 4 a.m. a line of about 200 police stretched across a street and in front of a federal courthouse.

Protesters facing them appeared to be in a festive spirits with some banging on plastic pails, another clanging a cowbell while others danced in the streets as a man juggled nearby.

Police had prepared for a possible clash, warning earlier that dozens of anarchists may be planning a confrontation with authorities.

Crackdown: Police in Denver forced protesters to leave a downtown encampment and arrested four people for interfering with officers who removed illegally pitched tents

Officers seized pieces of cement blocks Friday, saying they were told some demonstrators had plans to use them as weapons against police.

They've declared a war on corporate greed, but the Occupy Wall Street movement is costing small businesses big time.

'Occupied' coffee shops and 
restaurants near Zuccotti Park are chasing away the regular clientele, 
and the owners of the establishments are taking a nearly $500,000 hit.

A survey conducted by the New York 
Post showed that the businesses, which also include jewellery stores and
hair salons have collectively lost about $479,400 since the protest 
began on September 17.

one business owner told the paper: 
'We’re done with them! My customers used to take food to eat in the 
park, but now they can't.'

The staggering total does not even 
include the money lost on toilet paper and supplies to clean and repair 
bathrooms that used more than ever, thanks to protesters.

As the movements shows no signs of slowing, business owners don't know where to turn.

One proprietor told the paper that the regular customers - now scared away - are 'what keeps the lights on in this place.'

Police spokesman Lt. Robert King told the AP: 'They said they believe some demonstrators are building shields and trying to collect gas masks.

'We'll take action that's appropriate, when it's appropriate.'

'We are not going to engage in confrontation for a misdemeanour,' he said, noting that is the legal violation for remaining in the park after midnight.

It appeared earlier that about 200 campers planned to get arrested. 

But police action seemed less likely after the crowds swelled the parks in the early morning hours.

In the hours leading up to midnight, protesters held general assembly meetings where they talked about what to do when the deadline came. 

The also repeated the main message of Occupy Wall Street movement of peaceful resistance to income inequality and what they see as corporate greed.

As those speeches were going on, some snacked on coffee and burritos as others sang protest songs. 

About 60 bicycle riders circled the camp repeatedly to show support.

'We are a peaceful resistance,' said rider Chico Tallman, a 63-year-old accountant. 'But we're fed up with the direction the country is going. It's all about profit.'

Face-off: Nineteen people were arrested in Salt Lake City after police protesters refused to leave a park a day after a man was found dead inside his tent at the encampment

In Philadelphia, a protester with a criminal past was quickly arrested after he allegedly raped a woman in her tent, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported.

The 50-year-old suspect, who was not named, was booked after the 25-year-old victim called 911 to report the attack.  

In Salt Lake City, police arrested 19 people last night when protesters refused to leave a park a day after a man was found dead inside his tent at the encampment.

The arrests came after police moved into the park early in the evening where protesters had been ordered to leave by the end of the day. 

About 150 people had been living in the camp there for weeks.

Authorities in Denver forced protesters to leave a downtown encampment and arrested four people for interfering with officers who removed illegally pitched tents, said police spokesman Sonny Jackson.

Mr Jackson said police had advised protesters since Wednesday that their tents in Civic Center Park and on a nearby sidewalk were illegal.

Violence marked the protest in San Francisco yesterday where police said two demonstrators attacked two police officers in separate incidents during a march.

Police spokesman Carlos Manfredi said a protester slashed an officer's hand with a pen knife while another protester shoved an officer, causing facial cuts. 

He said neither officer was seriously hurt, and the assailants couldn't be located.

Meanwhile, in Southern California a small group of protesters braved soggy weather yesterday to gather for the first time under the banner of Occupy Inland Empire. 

Members of Occupy movements in Fontana, Redlands, Riverside, and other nearby towns marched past banks and in front of San Bernardino City Hall in what they called a 'visibility action,' The Sun newspaper reported.

Last night, Occupy Portland protesters dismantled large sections of their encampment, but dozens of tents remained after midnight.

For the second time in as many days, Oakland city officials warned protesters that they do not have the right to camp in the plaza in front of City Hall and face immediate arrest.

The eviction notices come as officials across the country urged an end to similar gatherings in the wake of three deaths in different cities, including two by gunfire.

Demands for Oakland protesters to pack up increased after a man was shot and killed Thursday near the encampment site.

'Your activities are injurious to health, obstruct the free use of property, interfering with the comfortable enjoyment of [Frank Ogawa Plaza], and unlawfully obstruct the free passage or use of a public park or square,' the notice read.

Oakland officials first issued the eviction notice Friday after first pleading with protesters to leave the encampment.

Police officials have said a preliminary investigation suggested the shooting resulted from a fight between two groups of men at or near the encampment. 

Investigators do not know if the men in the fight were associated with Occupy Oakland, but protesters said there was no connection between the shooting and the camp.

The shooting occurred the same day a 35-year-old military veteran apparently committed suicide in a tent at a Burlington, Vermont, Occupy encampment. 

Police said a preliminary investigation showed the veteran fatally shot himself in the head. 

They said the death raised questions about whether the protest would be allowed to continue.
