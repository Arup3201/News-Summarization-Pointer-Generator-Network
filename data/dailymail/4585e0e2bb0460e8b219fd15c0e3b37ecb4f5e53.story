Missing: Hollywood movie executive Gavin Smith, pictured, has been missing for three months

Police admitted today that there is something 'just not right' in the disappearance of a Hollywood executive who went missing three months ago.

Gavin Smith, 57, was reported missing on May 2 when he failed to pick up his teenage son for school in Los Angeles.

Authorities have said they strongly suspect foul play over what happened to the former UCLA basketball player.

A detective told Fox News that the home of John and Chandrika Creech was searched in connection with Mr Smith's disappearance.

John Creech, a drug dealer, was being held by police for an unrelated matter but the couple had not been entirely ruled out.

According to a source who spoke the LA Times in June, Smith was allegedly having an affair with Mrs Creech whom he met in a drug rehab program four years ago.

Mr Smith's family offered a $20,000 reward last month to anyone who knows his 
whereabouts.

A waitress at a southern California branch of Taco Temple told police she saw a man resembling Smith at the restaurant a few days after his disappearance, eating with a female companion.

Mystery: Mr Smith's wife and three children, pictured, said his disappearance was out of character

The Los Angeles Sheriff's Department 
have failed to locate the man since the sighting and Mr Smith's wife and
children are getting increasingly worried for his safety.

Mr
Smith, an 18-year veteran in the movie industry has helped distribute 
movies such as 'Avatar', 'Titanic' and the 'Star Wars' trilogy. He was 
most recently working for 20th Century Fox.

His wife, Lisa Smith, said her husband would never abandon his family and that she and her 
children suspected foul play in his disappearance.

'He
didn't pick up his son in the morning, that's a huge cause for 
concern,' Mrs Smith said.

'He didn't call his office, he didn't show up 
for work. He has never one of those things in 21 years.'

Mr Smith's eldest son, Evan Smith, a star basketball player at the University of Southern California, added: 'He would never do anything like that. He's a great father. My dad had no reason to leave. No reason at all'.

The 57-year-old had just returned from a movie 
convention in Las Vegas and was supposed to stay the night at a family 
friend's place in Oak Park, California.

After watching TV with the friend, he left the home at 10pm without warning.

'They had already gone to bed,' Mrs Smith said at the time. 'So he was still downstairs watching TV when our friend went to bed. And he was going to be coming up to bed shortly.'

Mr Smith left his mobile phone charger, 
shaving kit and other belongings at the friend's house and he was last 
seen wearing purple workout pants that had belonged to his teenage son, a
sure sign he had no intention of going out anywhere in public, 
according to the family.

Appeal: The movie executive's wife, Lisa Smith, pictured, is offering a $20,000 reward for help in the hunt for her husband

NBC News reported that a waitress at 
the Taco Temple in Morro Bay confirmed that a tall, blond-haired man 
matching Mr Smith's description had been spotted at the restaurant on 
May 7.

Marcy Carney said she chatted with Mr
Smith and the woman he was with while she waited on them and that the 
couple informed her they were heading 'up north'.

'They were kind of quiet when they first came in and then once I got them talking, they seemed real friendly,' Ms Carney said.

He paid for the food in cash and told the waitress to keep the change, she said.

'We just want him home safe and sound and we're just doing everything we possibly can,' his wife Mrs Smith said.
