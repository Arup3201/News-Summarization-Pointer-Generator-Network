Fitness and dieting apps are ten a penny, so in a saturated market it can be hard for new programmes to stand out.

The ‘Nenshou’
app from Japan is aiming to grab attention by marrying personal training with 'anime' dating - and throwing a bit of bullying into the mix too.

The app combines the world of ‘gaming dating’ (where the player is a lonely singleton who tries to win the affections of potential partners) with weight loss.

Not only that, but your virtual love interest hectors you into slimming down with ‘motivational’ statements such as ‘Fat girl, do some more exercise, okay?’

As your weight drops and love blossoms, you are taken through increasingly romantic scenarios - but the relationship depends on your dieting success

The app creates a love interest - a high school crush - who you try to impress by loosing weight. Sounds like a healthy relationship.

To start, each player creates an animated character, who then meets up 
with their childhood sweetheart. The long-lost love proceeds to tell you you've got fat
and need to lose weight. Charming.

The love interest then morphs into a personal trainer, who 'motivates' you through workouts - such as sets of crunches - becoming increasingly romantically interested as you lose weight.

The app has a number of workouts which are prescribed to you by your crush. As you exercise, your partner screams encouragement (what we might call abuse) while keeping count of your sit-ups or laps.

As your weight drops and love blossoms, you are taken through increasingly amorous scenarios - though how the relationship develops depends on your dieting success.

Your crush prescribes various exercises for you, then encourages you through your workout by shouting abuse

While the app aimed at women features a love interest who borders on sadistic, overweight boys get a sweet girl who encourages weight loss through compliments and concern.

Created by ‘Creative Freaks’ the app has done well in Japan, and there's now an English version available on ITunes and Google Play. However it remains to be seen how well Western women respond to being screamed at for being lardy.
