A botched restoration of a painting that was labelled 'Beast Jesus' has incredibly attracted a huge upsurge in tourism to a tiny Spanish village.

In the town of Borja, northern Spain, pensioner Cecilia Giménez took it upon herself, she says with the permission of the priest, to touch up the 'Ecce Homo' (Behold The Man) painting that was stationed in the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Mercy church.

The original was drawn by Elías Garcia Martínez, a Zaragoza art professor, but neglect in preserving the portrait stung Mrs Giménez into action. The painting is a 120-year-old fresco.

The 120-year-old painting was in a state of disrepair, so Mrs Giménez stepped in with her paintbrush

However, her brushwork completely obliterated the face of Jesus, transforming the painting into what locals described more like a hedgehog or monkey than Jesus.

But since the makeover, the restoration has attracted 150,000 tourists from all over the world, with people paying 80p (1 euro) to view the 'masterpiece'.

Speaking after news of her work broke, Mrs Giménez told Spanish TV: 'We have always repaired everything ourselves here. The priest knew about it. Of course he did.

'How could I do something like that without permission? I did not do it in secret. Anybody who entered the church was able to see me painting.

'I had nothing but good intentions and always believed I was doing the right thing. Besides, I hadn't finished the painting!'

Her handiwork has seen Giménez commissioned to design logos for the local winery, and the image of the new 'face of Jesus' adorns the town of 5,000's lottery tickets. 

However not everyone is happy with the developments. The grandchildren of the original artist sent a letter through a lawyer requesting the painting be destroyed as it brought shame on the original work and 'damages the honour of the family.'

However, a professional study decided it was impossible to restore the piece - in essence, Mrs Giménez's painting has become a 'new piece'.
