But for many people, the idea of trading in stocks and shares is overwhelming, and reserved for a select few - until now.

As with any apps that involve betting and investment, users are warned about the risks before spending any real money on the service, and are advised about the dangers involved.

The app takes users through step-by-step instructions on how to search for companies to invest in, how to sell shares and what the jargon means.

They can then trade on well-known brands, using their virtual currency, to get a feel for how the system works. 

If a user decides to become a real money investor, referred to as a seriousBux user, they can then begin making trades on companies across the market.

Each trader sets up a profile, and traders can compete against each other in Bux battles, and track the success of other users.

Bux battles are intense, timed contests to see who can make the best returns. 

All Bux users start with a funBux account.

The Wolf of Wall Street (starring Leonardo DiCaprio as Jordan Belfort) revealed the highs - and lows - a broker can have when playing the stock market. The film was criticised for glamourising Mr Belfort's crimes. The Bux app warns users about the risks involved in spread betting and trading

‘Nowadays we see far more people interested in big businesses - disruptive tech companies like Google, Facebook, GoPro or Netflix have an impact on everyone’s daily life.

‘With Bux, everyone now has the opportunity to learn about that world through trading and having fun.’

The app does warn that: ‘Spread Betting and CFDs are not suitable for all investors and you should ensure that you understand the risks involved and, if necessary, obtain independent financial advice to ensure that these products fit your investment objectives.

‘Tax law can be changed or may differ if you pay tax in a jurisdiction other than the UK.’
