A brave construction worker jumped into a vat of acid to save a co-worker who had fallen 40 feet through a rotting roof.

Father-of-three Martin Davis was left unconscious and airlifted to St Barnabas Medical Center in Clifton, New Jersey, to be treated for head-to-toe chemical burns.

His heroic rescuer, Rob Nuckols, was taken to St Joseph's Medical Center in Paterson with burns on his legs and abdomen from the nitric acid.

He was lucid and able to rinse himself off, however, according to My Fox New York.

Three other workers helped Mr Nuckols, 51, pull their injured colleague out and were also taken to hospital to be treated for burns, said NBC New York.

They were identified as Rob Fulton, 24; Joe Dabkowski, 45; and William Walker, who is in his 20s, according to northjersey.com.

Mr Nuckols told firefighters after the ordeal: 'I had to get him out of there.'

Mr Davis's brother John Davis said he was in critical condition after this morning's accident, with a broken rib, punctured lung and burns on his legs and side.

John Davis, who like his brother works in construction, said: 'In our trade we stick together. It’s a serious business. You’ll die out there. You’ve got your family to feed and you have got to protect each other.'

Fire officials said Mr Davis, 44, fell through the weakened part of the roof into a tank of acid used for cleaning steel.

Nitric acid is a strong acid and a powerful oxidising agent, which can cause chemical burns as it decomposes animal muscle.

Concentrated
nitric acid attacks tissues readily and stains human skin yellow when 
it reacts with the keratin. The stains turn orange when neutralised.

The
standard first aid treatment for acid spills on the skin is washing 
with large quantities of water for at least ten to 15 minutes to cool 
the tissue surrounding the burn and  prevent secondary damage.

The pair had been working on replacing a roof at Swepco Tube manufacturing plant when it collapsed.

Mr
Davis plunged into the tank containing 40 to 70 per cent nitric acid 
solution used for cleaning metal tubes, before quick-thinking Mr Nuckols  dove into the acid after him.

Mr Davis was described as bright red and in shock when he emerged from the vat. 'He was incoherent,' said fire chief Vincent Colavitti.

Firemen cut off his clothes and sprayed him with water.

Mr Colavitti hailed Mr Davis's bravery, saying: 'It takes a lot of courage. He saw one of his co-workers in trouble and he jumped in after him.'

Fire officials said the construction is under investigation for lacking the necessary permits.
