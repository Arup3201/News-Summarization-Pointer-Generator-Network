Officer: Rebecca Swanston (pictured today), 28, is alleged to have logged onto information systems and passed on confidential intelligence

A former woman police officer allegedly disclosed confidential intelligence and tactics, a court heard today.

Rebecca Swanston, 28, of Hampshire Police, is alleged to have logged onto information systems including the police records management system and passed on confidential intelligence.

Swanston, who today faced three charges of misconduct in public office, also allegedly failed to report a man for possessing class A drugs, plus confessions to assaults and other offences.

Instead of upholding the law, she shared details with the intention of frustrating ongoing probes, detection of crime and the apprehension of offenders, prosecutors claim.

Swanston, who was based at Southampton Central Police Station, is alleged to have committed the offences over a 10-month period between January and October last year.

Swanston, from Portsmouth, appeared at Basingstoke Magistratesâ€™ Court this morning for a brief hearing to hear the charges against her.

Dressed in a purple and black dress, she stood to hear the counts against her. Magistrates asked if she understood the allegations, from prosecutor Zoe Martin, and she replied 'yes'.

She denies wilfully neglecting to perform a duty as a holder of a public office from January 1 to October 18, 2012.

The
allegations of misconduct include accessing intelligence on the records
management system other than for a policing purpose, passing 
confidential police information to a Miguel Sewell and failing to report
his possession of class A drugs and his confession to an assault with a
weapon.

She also denies disclosing confidential 
police information to a Robert Morris, failing to report a confession, 
advising him about police procedures and giving him two police shirts.

Outside court: Swanston, of Portsmouth, allegedly failed to report a man for possessing class A drugs

The third count relates to accessing and leaking information and briefings about a suspect, Tariq Khan, to be passed onto him with the intention of frustrating an ongoing probe into serious offences.

Magistrates adjourned the case for trial and Swanston was bailed to appear at Winchester Crown Court for a plea and case management hearing on June 4.

She must sleep at her home address, not enter a given area and her passport must remain logged with Hampshire Police. These conditions have been in place 'for some time', the court heard.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
