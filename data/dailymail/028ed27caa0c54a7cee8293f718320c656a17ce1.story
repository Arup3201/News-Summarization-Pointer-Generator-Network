This incredible picture shows the body of a two-headed fire salamander which has just been donated to a German university.

The bizarre mutant lived for just six months in the collection of a private breeder who tried to feed it through both mouths.

It's body was donated to the Martin Luther University in Halle.

On me heads, son! This two-headed fire salamander was donated to Martin Luther University in Halle, Germany

He was never headed for anything: The poor 
bicephalous creature was donated by a private breeder who had tried to keep it alive
by feeding it through both mouths

The condition of having more than one head is known as polycephaly, with two-headedness described specifically by the terms bicephaly or dicephaly.

Each head of a polycephalic animal has its own brain, and they somehow share control of the organs and limbs, though the specific structure of the connections varies.

Such animals often move in a disoriented and dizzy fashion, with the brains 'arguing' with each other leading some specimens to simply zig-zag without getting anywhere.

In snakes, each head may attack and even attempt to swallow the other.

Biodiversity at Martin Luther University, takes a look at the dual-headed salamande, which was just six months old when it died

Fire salamanders are probably the best-known salamander species in Europe and are native to forests in the centre and south of the continent.

They can have incredibly long lifespans, with one specimen living for more than 50 years in the Museum Konig, a German natural history museum.

Their unusual name is believed to stem from old tales of the amphibians, which sometimes hide within holes and crevices in damp wood and tree trunks.

When woodsmen cut down such wood to make fires in the forest, heat would force any salamanders hiding within to dart away.

Legend: Fire salamanders were once believed to be born from flames after people saw them emerging from logs which they had cut for use as fire wood. One imagines what they would have thought of this beast

This gave them the appearance of 'crawling from within the flames' and led to the belief that they were formed from fire.

This double-headed salamander was pictured last week as it was handed over to researchers at Martin Luther University.

Just six months old when it died, it was born into the collection of a private lizard breeder who had attempted to raise the animal by feeding both heads separately.
