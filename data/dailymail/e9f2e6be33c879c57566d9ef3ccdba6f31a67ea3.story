Jonny Wilkinson was awarded honorary citizenship of Toulon by the French city's mayor on Sunday as the curtain came down on the rugby legend's glittering career.

Wilkinson, who turned 35 last month, helped guide Toulon to a Top 14 and Heineken Cup double as the mega-rich club defeated Saracens and Castres in the final two games of his career.

Toulon's players arrived in the city's port by boat as thousands of fans gathered to greet their heroes, who delivered the club's first French league title since 1992 just a week after being crowned kings of Europe for a second successive season.

Wilkinson was then awarded his citizenship by mayor Hubert Falco before he gave an acceptance speech in perfect French.

On Monday he tweeted: 'A amazing honour to have been part of this Toulon squad 4 the last 5 years, to have seen what I have seen + to have played with such legends.

'I am 1 of the luckiest people alive today. I had a 17 season career and have been given way more than I will ever be able pay back.Thank you.'

Wilkinson joined Toulon in 2009 after spending the first 12 years of his career in the Premiership with Newcastle Falcons.

He amassed 91 England caps at fly half between 1998 and 2011, competing at four World Cups and memorably guiding England to their only ever Webb Ellis Trophy back in 2003.

When the whistle blew against on Saturday fans from both Toulon and Castres stood and sang God Save the Queen in tribute to Wilkinson.

'This is what Iâ€™ll be able to tell my grandchildren,' said team-mate and France international Mathieu Bastareaud, 'that Iâ€™ve played a with a great man.'

Fitting end: Wilkinson's glittering career ended in the best possible way
