Scrawl: Lucian Freud's letter to a girl doing 
her A-levels reveals that the revered artist did not take as much 
care over his calligraphy as his portraiture

His prowess with the paintbrush helped him become one of the world’s most revered artists.

But it appears that Lucian Freud didn’t possess quite the same talent when it came to the pen.

The
 celebrated painter, who died in 2011 at the age of 88, had surprisingly
 childlike handwriting – revealed in a letter he wrote to a young art 
student almost two decades ago.

The
 note was sent to Katie Wilson in 1996 when he was 73, in response to a 
letter she wrote asking for help with her A-level art project about the 
life of the celebrated painter.

She contacted Freud, who is most well known for his nude portraits, to ask why he was so fascinated by the human figure.

He replied in scrawled writing: ‘So you’re studying Painting and Dancing – I think they are the two best subjects.

‘You ask why I’m fascinated by the human figure? As a human animal I am interested in some of my fellow animals, in their minds and bodies. I never think about my style but just try and make the pictures look believable. Lucian Freud.’

Miss Wilson, who is now in her thirties, is selling the letter at auction house Bonhams on March 19. News of the sale has been greeted with excitement by experts, as Freud rarely talked about his work publicly or gave interviews.

It is believed the letter, still mounted in the 21-page school art project, will fetch around £3,000.

Claire Wilkins from Bonhams’ book department, which is handling the sale, said: ‘As a succinct statement of Freud’s artistic aims this could hardly be bettered. By 1996 Freud had attained international fame as a modern master - a status he never lost - and yet found the time to send a very personal and considered reply to an unknown student.’

Graphologist Barbara Weaver, who is a handwriting analyst at the Cambridge School of Graphology, said that Freud’s disconnected writing was evidence of a man who was patient in his work, but who ‘put two fingers up to the establishment’.

She said: ‘The writing appears childish and immature. It could almost pass for the writing of a child of seven or eight, a novice in handwriting rather than belonging to an acclaimed artist.

‘Freud uses displaced capitals where they do not belong (for instance beLievabLe). This generally indicates a writer who is not one to follow the usual or the traditional. He is someone who wants to make his own way in the world without much input from outside sources.

‘His lowercase letters such as ‘a’ and ‘d’ are made in two separate movements. The circle is separated from the downstroke. He was a law unto himself and put two fingers up to the establishment.

‘His signature is legible and bears his complete name. He is comfortable with himself.

‘However, it is quite modest in size – it reveals his public face. It shows he was more comfortable working on his own. Since his signature sags somewhat, he may have been tiring of the effort involved in being who he was.

‘His writing is disconnected. The address, note and signature are written in printscript. The speed is slow and this means he was patient and painstaking in his work.

‘Margins can act as a visible or invisible border demarcating the amount of space the writer perceives he occupies in real life. Freud fills the page with his writing – he wants to be centre stage.

‘The size of the number 3 for instance in the address is larger than the neighbouring capitals. This suggests a preoccupation at the time with monetary matters.’

A recent biography of the artist 
suggested he loved cash, often keeping wads inside wine coolers at his 
home, while he was also frequently owed gambling debts.

Freud, the grandson of psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud, was widely regarded as the greatest painter of the human form during the late 20th and early 21st century. He is revered for his nudes and portraits and was hailed as the heir of Rembrandt and Hals.

In 2007, he became Europe’s most expensive living artist when his full-length portrait of his friend Bruce Bernard sold for £7.86m. Less than six months later, a large double portrait of his daughter Isabel Boyt and her husband, fetched over £9m.

And in 2008 Freud’s 1995 painting, Benefits Supervisor Sleeping, a portrait of his model ‘Big Sue’ Tilley, set another record for a living artist when it was sold for over £17m to Roman Abramovich.

He is almost as well-known for his turbulent love-life as he is for his artwork. The Greek sculptor Vassilakis Takis, who knew him well, estimated that Lucian had up to 500 lovers and he was known to have fathered at least 14 children during his life. Three daughters were born in the same year, while two were given the same name.

His marriage to Kathleen Garman lasted four years and the pair divorced in 1952. They had two daughters together, Annie and Annabel.

His second marriage, to Caroline Blackwood in 1953, ended in 1957. He never married again, but Freud went on to have numerous love affairs, including with Suzy Boyt, a former student of his at the Slade art school in London, who was the subject of his painting Woman Smiling.

Suzy gave birth to a son, Alexander, in 1957, followed by four more children, novelist Rose Boyt, Isobel, author Susie Boyt and Kai.

He also had fathered fashion designer Bella Freud, 52, and novelist Esther Freud, 50, by the writer and gardener Bernardine Coverley, and a son, Frank, now aged 28, with the painter Celia Paul.

In 2001, at the age of 79, Freud set up house with Emily Bearn, a young journalist 52 years his junior.

He also struck up an unlikely friendship with model Kate Moss, which blossomed after he painted an almost life-size nude of her while she was pregnant with her daughter, Lila Grace, in 2003.

In a biography of the artist, Geordie Greig described Freud as ‘an odd mix of vanity with a touch of the vagrant’, a man who ‘had a sense of his own destiny,’ with a towering ambition to be an artist’.
