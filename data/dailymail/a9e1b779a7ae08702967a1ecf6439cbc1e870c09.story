Andy Murray has accused his critics of double standards in the wake of Rafael Nadal's dramatic comeback win over American Tim Smyczek in the Australian Open second round.

The 27 year-old Scot was back on the practice courts on Thursday ahead of his own third round against Joao Sousa, but before that he took to Twitter and took a pointed swipe at reaction to the Nadal win, which saw him come back from cramps to survive in five sets.

'When I cramped and won in the US Open last year I was a "drama queen, unfit, needs to see a shrink, faker" weird…' he posted.

Murray was clearly not having a go at Nadal, but taking umbrage at what may have been said via various platforms about his match last year at Flushing Meadows against Dutchman Robin Haase, in which he suffered cramping before coming through in four sets.

As someone who has come through his share of matches when he has had to overcome physical difficulty he feels there are some double standards at play.

There are myriad of ways these days for anyone to express a personal view via social media – and many thousands of words will have passed the lips of broadcasters about the Haase match.

However, an initial search of mainstream reports filed by those who were in New York does not show up any obvious accusations that Murray was malingering in some way.

American supercoach Nick Bollettieri is noted as having said: 'One minute Murray is dying, the next he is a gladiator.'

But there does not appear any widespread suggestions of what the player thinks was said.

Sportsmail, for example, noted that he was 'cramping, limping and lolling around like a wounded beast' before closing the match out in four sets when barely able to serve properly. But there is also the conclusion that 'it is much to Murray's credit that he still won. Lesser competitors would have succumbed.'

Among the circumstances that some reports point out is that he and Haase were called very abruptly to the court with little time for preparation, as the preceding women's match took only 47 minutes, and that he has a history of struggling on the Louis Armstrong Stadium, where the match took place.

Murray has been especially sensitive about how on court physical issues are portrayed since a match against Finland's Jarkko Nieminen at the 2012 French Open, during which he suffered back spasms before coming through to win.

The commentating Virginia Wade used the term 'drama queen' to describe his demeanour, which inevitably got plenty of traction in the media.

This probably explains his latest outpouring on Twitter, a fairly blunt instrument that affords precious little scope for wider explanation (see his declaration about Scottish independence, for example).

It also points to him being very much keyed up for this high-pressure fortnight, the next leg for him being Friday's encounter with world number 55 Sousa from Portugal. It is probably a positive thing, as a sense of indignation has always been a powerful motivational tool for Murray.
