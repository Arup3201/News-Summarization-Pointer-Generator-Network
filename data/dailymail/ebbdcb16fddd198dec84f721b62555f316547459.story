Police have appealed for help in identifying a man spotted outside a high school just 90 seconds before a 14-year-old girl went missing and just yards away from where she was later found murdered

Marysa Nichols left Red Bluff High School on Tuesday just before 11am in a gap between classes, however she failed to return home that evening causing her parents to report her missing

Her body was discovered yesterday next to a creek on the route she normally took to get home close to the small town high school.

Police search: Officers are trying to track down this man who was caught on high school security footage just moments before a 14-year-old girl, later found murdered, was reported missing

Murdered: Young Marysa Nichols, pictured, was found dead on Thursday - her body discovered by a creek on her usual route home from school

Body: The body of the 14-year-old was discovered near a creek just a short distance from the high school she snuck out of two days before

Her death is being treated as a homicide
and police say the man caught on security cameras is a 'person of 
interest' in their case.

The man is described as white, in his thirties with a stocky short build. He was wearing red shorts and is said to have a distinctive 'colorful' tattoo on his left ankle.

Police are urging witnesses to report if they saw the man in the area on 530-737-3160 and 530-737-3225.

He is filmed on a street corner near the school just a minute and a half before Marysa Nichols reaches the same corner and is also caught on camera.

Red Bluff Police Chief Paul Nanfito said: 'I want the assistance of the public in finding that man. He is a person of interest who may merely be a witness but it is important that we know who he is'.

The officer said that the force have no suspects at this time but had made contact with registered sex offenders in the area.

He refused to release any further details about the homicide as he said he didn't want to compromise the investigation.

Mother's tribute: Marysa Nichols' mother Diane Whitmire published these pictures of her daughter onto her Facebook account. The pretty 14-year-old was missing for two days before her body was found

Uniform: This is the sweatshirt Marysa Nichols was to believed to be wearing when she went missing on Tuesday. Her body was found yesterday

When asked why the teenager left her 
high school, he added: 'My understanding is it had to do with her 
scheduling. She had one class and didn't have to return until 1pm.'

Police found her body yesterday.

Officers searched the field, where she was eventually found, three times before discovering her body.

In a statement yesterday the police chief said: 'Marysa told her mother that she would be home at around 2:30 p.m. in the afternoon.

'When her mother returned home at 
around 4 p.m. her daughter was not at home. Detectives searched the 
creek area for the missing juvenile as this is an area that she would 
have crossed when walking home from school.

'Based
upon the scene we have determined that this is a homicide 
investigation. Our investigation is continuing and an autopsy is 
scheduled for Saturday.'

Thursday as news broke that her body had been found.
