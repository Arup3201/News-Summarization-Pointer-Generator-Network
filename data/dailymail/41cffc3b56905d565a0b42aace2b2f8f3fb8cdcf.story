The Ministry of Justice has refused to ban websites showing simulated violent scenes of child abuse and rape, insisting there is ‘no evidence’ to link them to the actual crimes.

In a letter to concerned charities, an official played down the suggestion that websites purporting to show rape can lead users to commit sex offences.

Dave Pearson said: ‘We note what you say about such images potentially glorifying sexual violence . . . However, we are not convinced that evidence for this is any more than anecdotal and cannot, therefore, be used to justify a change in the law.’

Inspired to kill: Mark Bridger, right, who was last week jailed for the murder of April Jones, and Stuart Hazell, left, who murdered 12-year-old Tia Sharp, both progressed from viewing child porn to committing child murder

The letter came after charities wrote
to the Ministry of Justice asking it to consider reclassifying such 
simulation sites as illegal.

They are already banned in Scotland. Last 
week the Mail revealed research which shows that one in six men who view
child porn go on to abuse youngsters.

The MoJ’s response emerged a week 
after Mark Bridger was given a life sentence for the murder of 
five-year-old April Jones. He had collected a ‘library’ of sickening 
images.

Both he and Stuart 
Hazell, who murdered 12-year-old Tia Sharp, had no previous convictions 
for sexual offences and progressed from viewing child porn on the 
internet to committing child murder.

But
the department’s dismissive response seemed to contradict its own 
evidence assessment, which pointed out that rapists ‘are much more 
aroused by depictions of coercion than non-criminals’ and that ‘one 
third of rapists report using forced sexual depictions as part of their 
deliberate pre-offence preparation’.

Sites which show actual rape and child abuse are banned under existing pornography legislation.

But those purporting to show simulated rape and child abuse are not illegal in England and Wales.

More than 100 campaigners have written to David Cameron, urging him to ban depictions of ‘rape or other non-consensual penetrative sexual activity’.

Anyone found downloading such images would be committing an offence.

A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said: ‘We share the public’s concern about the availability of harmful content on the internet and have already taken steps to ensure there are better online filters to protect children.

'But we want to look at what more can be done and so the Culture Secretary has invited internet providers to a summit this month.’
