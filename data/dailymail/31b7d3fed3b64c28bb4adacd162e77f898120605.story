A 'drunk' driver careered off a residential road, knocked down a lamppost and crashed into the front of a house - but still staggered away unhurt.

Residents of the Victorian house - which has been converted into three flats - described the noise as being like 'gunfire' when the Ford Focus piled through the wooden porch and front wall.

It came to a halt less than a metre from a downstairs bathroom at the property in Barnet, north London causing thousands of pounds worth of damage.

A driver came off a road, knocked down a lamppost and then crashed his Ford Focus into a property in Barnet

The crash on Tuesday night left a gaping hole in the front wall and wooden porch of the converted house

The car came to a halt less than a metre from a downstairs bathroom at the property in Barnet, north London

Paul Rea, 56, was in his ground-floor bedroom when the black Ford crashed into the house at 11.31pm on Tuesday night. 

He told the London Evening Standard: 'We heard a huge noise and the whole house shook. There was dust everywhere and parts of the car all over.

'The car was stuck halfway out of the house. The driver and his passenger were still around and were looking for something in the car.

'Thankfully they missed my front room and my bathroom. If I had been in those rooms, the car would have missed me by less than a metre. 

'God forbid anyone would have been walking down the stairs or coming back to the house, they would have had no chance.'

 A 30-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of drink driving, dangerous driving, possession of cannabis, committing grievous bodily harm and assaulting a police officer

Margaret Redmond, 52, who lives in the upstairs flat, said: 'I first thought the noise was thunder' 

Neighbour Samantha Dossett, 40, who saw the crash, said: 'I was watching TV in bed with my husband when all of a sudden we heard two small bangs,  quickly followed by a massive bang.

'It sounded like gunfire, like a bomb had gone off.I rushed outside in time to see the passenger and the driver crawl out of the car. They looked dazed and confused, but not injured. 

'Police were here within seconds, and the driver got very aggressive. 

She added: 'A police officer who took my statement told me they suspected the driver had been drinking.

'I'm not surprised, it would have had to take some pretty spectacularly bad driving to come off the road and hit that house. I'm just glad everybody is okay.' 

Neighbours were trapped in the house until 6am the following morning as workers cleared the debris away

Margaret Redmond and her husband John, who live in an upstairs flat, came running down to find the hallway blocked by a pile of smashed bricks and rubble.

Mrs Redmond, 52, said: 'I first thought the noise was thunder. I scrambled to get dressed and opened the front door and the stairs had gone.' 

The couple were trapped in their flat until until 6am on Wednesday as the car was removed and workers cleared the debris from the entrance hall.

Surveyors for housing association Family Mosaic carried out an assessment and found that the structure of the building is safe. It is estimated that the cost to the building will be thousands of pounds.
