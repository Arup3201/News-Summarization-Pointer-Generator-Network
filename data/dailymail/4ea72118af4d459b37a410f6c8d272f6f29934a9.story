Ashton: The club need to be supportive off the field, to create an environment so that his family can settle in the north west and enjoy their life in Cheshire.

His wife wants to leave the country and return to Argentina, and Di Maria is wrestling with that decision: Let her leave with the children and leave him to continue his United career, or move to another club more suited to their lifestyle in Europe. Tough one.

Ashton: Without a doubt. He looked the business with his great Ajax team in the Nineties and he has an excellent record in European football.

The problem is that he has under-estimated some of the demands and the customs of English football, such as the Capital One Cup defeat at MK Dons and the failure to inspire the supporters at Old Trafford.

He claimed United would be stronger in the second half of the season. They actually look disillusioned and directionless.

Ashton: Busy. I was surprised that Van Gaal did not build from the back when he arrived, buying top class defenders (although I like Marcos Rojo) to make sure United would be difficult to beat.

Everybody with a passing interest in the club knew that they would need defensive reinforcements after Nemanja Vidic, Rio Ferdinand and Patrice Evra left.

The task of rescuing United and turning them into a formidable attacking presence again was bigger than he thought, possibly too big.

Ashton: Not a lot, but at the pressure moment of the game he delivered. He spotted the back pass, the opportunity to take Arsenal into the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley if he could take advantage inside a stadium where he has only ever known what it is like to play in red.

To finish the way he did, clipping the ball around the advancing figure of David de Dea, was a moment of composure and genuine class.

Ashton: Absolutely right. Van Gaal was dismissive of him when he decided to sell, claiming that he was not of the standard required for his new United team.

He had been fairly anonymous until his goal, but he took it brilliantly. When he was substituted he showed respect for his surroundings by clapping all four corners of the stadium.

You know in his heart of hearts he would still like to be a United player, but the decision was taken away from him.

Ashton: History is on Arsenal’s side because they have won the trophy five times under Wenger. If Liverpool reach the final then it will be difficult for them to deviate from the narrative about it being a fitting send off for the captain Steven Gerrard before his move to LA Galaxy.

The reality is that it would be a distraction, particularly for a team that hasn't won the competition since 2006. Having said that, Gerrard’s contribution to the 2006 FA Cup final against West Ham was superhuman. You could not rule out something special.

Ashton: United measure their seasons on silverware, not top four finishes.

At the moment they are making up the numbers, trying to work out where they are heading under a manager who appears uncertain of his own values.

Van Gaal is becoming increasingly tetchy and his response on Monday evening, sarcastically batting away questions, is a sure sign that he is under pressure.

Finishing in the top four would be an achievement, nothing more.

Ashton: Yes. To win a sixth FA Cup under one manager would be impressive, but Wenger wants another crack at the Premier League title before he calls it quits at the Emirates.

To do that he will need a better squad, not team, than Chelsea and Manchester City. As good as Arsenal look at times, they do not have the muscular presence and stature of Chelsea.

Ashton: A quiet word is needed because English football frowns upon it. I do actually have sympathy in some instances because I’m sure that a lot of players throw themselves to the floor to avoid robust challenges in situations where they think they might get injured or seriously hurt by an opposition player.

Gareth Bale is a case in point, because he had a terrible reputation for diving when he was at Spurs.

Ashton: He has added a protective force in the shape of Coquelin, an unexpected bonus after he was sent out on loan to Charlton.

He has made the grade because he has finally listened to the coaches who told him that he could have a career in the position, provided he sacrificed his initial preference to be more extravagant on the ball.

The big test is whether he can get the better of Nemanja Matic in the big games with Chelsea. If he can’t get to grips with him then they will be second best again next season.

Ashton: It was a bizarre decision to substitute two players at half-time because United were in the ascendency after Rooney scored the equaliser.

After the game Wenger even conceded that his players had been demoralised at half-time because they felt they did not deserve to have been pegged back.

Van Gaal should have persisted for a little while longer, but the changes disrupted the team’s rhythm. It felt like a big mistake at the time and an even bigger one when Arsenal scored the winner.

Ashton: I am not sure he has a philosophy because he urges caution and does not want to play with risk, and yet he makes two huge gambles at half-time with his substitutions.

Everybody can bring in players, but has he really identified the players who can turn United in to a team capable of challenging for the top four? Patience is beginning to wear thin.
