A female fighter pilot yesterday led Britain’s first combat mission against Islamic State – as the RAF launched two waves of attack against the deadly terrorists.

The unnamed officer piloted one of two heavily-armed jets that flew from a top-security RAF base in Cyprus on the dangerous sortie over IS-held territory in Northern Iraq, before returning safely to complete her 2,000-mile round trip.

The sortie, lasting several hours, was the first mission for the RAF’s Operation Shader against IS militants. And last night two more Tornado GR4 aircraft took off from the Cyprus base, bound for Northern Iraq.

The first day of ‘Gulf War Three’, the first British combat missions over Iraq for six years, involved Tornados bristling with sophisticated weaponry flying in support of Iraqi troops engaging IS terrorists in trench warfare below.

Defence sources conceded last night that neither of the Tornados in the first wave engaged the enemy and both jets returned to RAF Akrotiri with their full payloads of rockets and ammunition intact – highlighting growing concern over whether Britain is pulling its weight in the coalition arrayed against IS.

Female Tornado pilots conducted hundreds of sorties over Afghanistan as part of Britain’s war against the Taliban.

In early 2010, Flight Lieutenant Juliette Fleming (right) described how she was repeatedly called upon to swoop down within 100ft of rocket-wielding fanatics to disrupt their attacks on UK troops in Helmand province.

Flt Lieut Fleming was based at RAF Marham, Norfolk, where many of the air crew serving as part as Operation Shader are based.

There are thought to be about ten female fighter pilots cleared to fly Typhoon or Tornado jets in combat missions for the RAF.

The Americans by contrast, yesterday continued their heavy bombardment of key IS strongholds around the city of Raqqa, in Northern Syria, where it is believed British hostages Alan Henning and John Cantlie are being held under threat of decapitation.

The Mail on Sunday was invited to witness the first Tornados taking off, as Britain finally joined the international coalition taking offensive action against IS, which has taken control of vast areas of Northern Iraq and Syria.

The mission remained the subject of secrecy last night as defence sources refused to disclose whether the RAF pilots had flown in support of Iraqi or Kurdish fighters and whether the mission had been a success. The first mission was described as a ‘routine operational sortie’ with air crews using new rules of engagement approved by Parliament on Friday for the first time.

A defence source said: ‘The mission involved responding to a changing situation on the ground, with moving targets rather than static positions being on the agenda.

‘The aircraft were equipped with weapon systems reflecting the operational requirements but on this occasion no rockets were fired.

‘The two Tornados then flew back to RAF Akrotiri and the crews went through their routine debriefing process.

‘It is likely that further missions will take place in the days ahead.’

The MoS understands that yesterday’s first mission was conducted by No 2 Squadron RAF and followed a request for air support received on Friday evening – only a few hours after MPs voted by an overwhelming majority of 524 votes to 43 to endorse attacks on the militants in Iraq.

The requirements of the specific mission were then pieced together overnight and into yesterday morning, with officers from the RAF’s 140 Expeditionary Air Wing (EAW), which deployed to Cyprus last month, liaising with staff at Permanent Joint Headquarters (PJHQ) back in Britain.

Then, at about 9.30am and in humid conditions at the base on Cyprus’s southern coast, the chosen pilots and navigators emerged from a hangar and walked casually towards their aircraft.

They spent almost an hour inspecting every inch of the Tornados, checking for any fault which could compromise their safety. Then the crews climbed two-by-two inside their aircraft, strapped themselves and lowered the canopies.

Until yesterday, their missions, though vital, had been benign. This was the first time they could have been called upon to extinguish human life.

At around 10.30am, the Tornados rolled onto the runway and, with a deafening howl of their Rolls-Royce engines, sped across the tarmac and ascended rapidly into the overcast Eastern Mediterranean skies.

They were followed minutes later by a huge RAF Voyager refuelling aircraft, used to top up aviation gas supplies for the round trip to Northern Iraq. As a diplomatic courtesy to countries who do not wish to publicise their role in the coalition against IS, defence sources declined to disclose the flight path taken by the aircraft as they flew to and from the battlefield. The pilots were guided over IS-held territory by American flight planners.

The involvement of a woman RAF pilot comes after female pilot Major Mariam Al Mansouri of the UAE was revealed to have flown an F-16 jet in bombing raids against IS positions in Syria last week.

Yesterday, the US and other coalition countries again conducted air strikes against known IS targets inside the enemy’s heartland of Syria. Defence experts have argued that the only way to defeat IS is to target them where they are strongest but British forces remain restricted in where they may launch attacks against the jihadis. It was with great relief to all 2,500 military and civilian personnel stationed at RAF Akrotiri that the first pair of jets touched down safely at around 3.30pm local time yesterday.

Shortly afterwards, defence sources confirmed that neither aircraft undertook offensive action and that – despite media attention – the mission had been restricted to reconnaissance and intelligence-gathering.

An MoD spokesman said: ‘Royal Air Force Tornado GR4 aircraft have been flying intelligence gathering missions over Iraq for a number of weeks. Today, following the parliamentary approval given yesterday, in company with other aircraft from the international coalition, two Tornados conducted armed reconnaissance operations over areas of Iraq where the terrorists threaten the civilian population.

‘Although on this occasion no targets were identified as requiring immediate air attack by our aircraft, the intelligence gathered by the Tornados’ highly sophisticated surveillance equipment will be invaluable in developing the best possible understanding of ISIL’s disposition and help acquire potential targets for future operations.

‘Furthermore, we know that the very presence of coalition air power has a significant impact on ISIL’s efforts to attack the Iraqi people.

‘With no effective defence against air strikes, and knowing the precision with which coalition aircraft can hit them, the terrorists are forced to be much more cautious, keeping their forces dispersed and movement inhibited.

‘They also know that should they concentrate to deliver an attack against Iraqi or Kurdish troops, aircraft are likely to arrive overhead very soon afterwards.’

News of the Tornados’ first sorties came as the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that US air strikes in Raqqa killed 23 IS terrorists yesterday.

There was fierce fighting between Kurdish militia and the IS fanatics for the town of Kobani on the Syria-Turkey border, which has been besieged for the last ten days.

Most of the local population – numbering about 150,000 people – have poured into Turkey as the IS fighters battle for control of the strategically important area.

Dozens of IS extremists continued to shell the town yesterday.
