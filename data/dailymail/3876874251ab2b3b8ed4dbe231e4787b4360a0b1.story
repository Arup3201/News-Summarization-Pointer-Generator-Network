An Australian company has developed a series of wines based on Game of Thrones, inspired by not just the show but the intensity of watching episodes of the bloody fantasy series.

Common Ventures is the Australia company who masterminded the project, and said they were surprised by how influenced they were by the character's drinking habits.

The Wines of Westeros feature 12 red and white varieties with names including The Wildling, The Stark, The Lannister and The Dothraki.

'After our favourite characters had scaled the wall, we were left with the idea to brand and create a wine for each of our favourite houses and their heroes,' Jane Burhop from Common Ventures told AAP.

'The sigil and variant of each bottle directly reflects the personality of each house. The reds are all associated with the houses that are head strong and robust. The whites on the other hand are more cunning, perceptive and mysterious.'

It's also designed for those hard-to-watch episodes, for anyone thinking of re-watching The Red Wedding.

'This wine is made to be drunk with friends and to help soften the blow of the shock and heartache as our favourite characters are slowly killed off,' Burhop said.

The range is based on the 12 houses in the show, and there are six red and six white drops

The company are still in talks with some smaller independent Australian wineries to secure 'the perfect grapes for your goblets'.

Although The HBO series has inspired a plethora of merchandise, this appears to be the first alcoholic kind. Common Ventures said they created the range as massive fans of the show.

They are hoping the wine's launch will coincide with the fifth season premiere of Game of Thrones in 2015, with the bottles to be sold at Australian independent liquor stores and online.

'This however will be dependant of how long it takes our ships to cross the Narrow sea,' Burhop said.

The bottles are expected to sell around the $20 mark, which roughly equates to four pieces of gold dragon.

The full range boasts six white whines, The Arryn, The Greyjoy, The Stark, The Tyrell, The White Walker and The Wilding.

Half a dozen reds make up the full 12 houses on the show, named The Baratheon, The Dothraki, The Lannister, The Martell, The Night's Watch and The Targaryen.
