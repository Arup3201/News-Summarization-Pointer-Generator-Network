When people stumble across a four-leaf clover, they are told to expect good luck.

But, for Little Olivia Wrenn, the future is even brighter than that after she found an even rarer five-leaf clover.

The curious seven-year-old found the five-leaf clover on a walk through a bluebell wood near her home in Horton, Somerset.

Four-leaf variants of clover are seen to be lucky, but ultra-rare five-leaf clovers are luckier still and are said to attract money.

Following her rare discovery, the schoolgirl asked her mother Karen to preserve the lucky flower by putting it in a laminator, alongside the date.

Mrs Wrenn said: 'I understand it is very rare to have one. We have kept it and laminated it to preserve it.'

Olivia added: 'I couldn't believe it when I saw it. It's so pretty.'

A four-leaf clover is a universally accepted symbol of good luck. However, a five-leaf clover is said to attract extra good luck as well as money.

The five-leaf clover is a mutation just like the four-leaf clover, however, it is much less common.

Occasionally, six and seven-leaf clovers can occur.
