A haulage firm boss and a lorry driver were caught smuggling more than £5million worth of drugs into the UK in oil drums.

Firm boss Dean Castle and employee Carl Haynes were jailed for a total of 37 years after customs officers in Dover found huge quantities of heroin, amphetamine and other drugs buried in sand in drums on the HGV.

Haynes, 42, was arrested after officers caught him transporting 26 kilos of heroin, 80 kilos of amphetamine, 147 kilos of cannabis, more than 40,000 tablets and 517 grams of Class A drug MDMA.

He claimed the 13 drums contained lubricant, which he was taking to a company in Maidstone.

Enquiries led Border Agency officers to Castle, 31, owner of the firm in question, Dean Castle Transport.

A raid at his home uncovered evidence that the pair had been smuggling ‘huge quantities’ of drugs over the border in HGVs since November 2009.

Haynes, of Margate, Kent, and Castle, of Dover, Kent, both denied five counts of being knowingly concerned in the fraudulent evasion of the prohibition of controlled drugs, but were found guilty after a 13-day trial at Canterbury Crown Court.

Illegal cargo: Haynes was caught him transporting 26 kilos of heroin, 80 kilos of amphetamine, 147 kilos of cannabis, more than 40,000 tablets and 517 grams of Class A drug MDMA

'Vile business': Enquiries led Border Agency officers to the home of Castle, where they found evidence of more smuggling dating back to 2009

Yesterday, Castle was jailed for 20 years and Haynes for 17.

Malcolm Bragg from Border Force - which revealed the photos of the oil drums and huge stash of drugs today - said: 'Drug smuggling is a vile business that exploits the misery of others for an easy profit.

'The sentences handed down today should act as a warning to those who attempt to smuggle illegal drugs into this country.

'The message is clear – if you are involved in drug smuggling we will catch you and you will go to jail for a long time.'

Clever trick: The drugs were stashed in 13 oil drums, which Haynes claimed contained lubricant, and covered with sand
