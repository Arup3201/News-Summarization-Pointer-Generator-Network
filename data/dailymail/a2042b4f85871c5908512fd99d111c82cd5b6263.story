For those that moan about rocketing New York City rental prices: this one's for you.

With sweeping views of Central Park and 5,000 square feet of living space, it won't come as a surprise that this palatial apartment on the 39th floor of the Pierre Hotel is on the costly side.

But even realtors have been shocked by the price tag - set at $500,000 a month, easily the most expensive rental in the city's history.

Palatial: This is the living room of New York City's most expensive rental in the Pierre Hotel which is on the market for $500,000 a month

Gaping views: The penthouse overlooks Central Park, the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir and the George Washington Bridge

It is double the price of the second most expensive apartment in the city, which pales in comparison at a measly $250,000 a month.

The 4,786-square-foot floor includes the two-bedroom Presidential Suite, with the option of adding two other spaces bringing it to a total of six bedrooms. 

Perched at 2 East 61st Street, the delicate windows look out over Central Park, the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir and George Washington Bridge.

And if the pantry kitchen is too small for would-be renters, they can always nip down to one of the hotel's two restaurants, Sirio Ristorante and Two E Bar/Lounge.

Gold lining: Each of the six rooms has velvet patterned curtains, gold-lined bed sheets and bespoke artworks like this Giacometti lookalike

Luxurious living: Twice-daily housekeeping, butler service and a chauffeur-driven Jaguar are also available at the touch of a button

Lazing around: Sundays will be perfect lying in this marble bath on a marble podium looking out over the city 

Twice-daily housekeeping, butler service and a chauffeur-driven Jaguar are also available at the touch of a button.

Tenants must sign a lease for at least one month, and can stay for as long as they like on a month-to-month basis.

Therese Bateman and Andres Perea-Garzon of Town Fifth Avenue have exclusive listing of the property, which they claim fills a 'strong unmet demand' in the city for large, flexible rentals. 

Not in the mood to cook? You can head downstairs to one of the hotel's two high-end restaurants Sirio Ristorante and Two E Bar/Lounge

Services: The hotel, a celebrity favorite, was once owned by Standard Oil tycoon John Paul Getty and features deluxe services
