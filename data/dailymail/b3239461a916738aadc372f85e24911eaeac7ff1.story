Bravery: Lance Corporal Bruce Toge was awarded the Conspicuous Gallery Cross for saving five wounded comrades during a Taliban attack

A hero of the Afghan war who displayed 'superhuman' strength to rescue five wounded comrades while under fire from the Taliban is selling the medal he was awarded for £70,000.

Lance Corporal Bruce Toge was knocked out when insurgents attacked his armoured vehicle with rocket-propelled grenades, but after he came to he immediately started saving his fellow soldiers.

The brave soldier single-handedly carried five troops - all inexperienced members of the Afghan National Army - out of harm's way during the incident in 2008.

He was awarded the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross, the second highest award for valour after the Victoria Cross, for his 'raw courage and inspirational leadership.'

But L/Cpl Toge, 29, has now left the Army, and is selling the medal to raise money so he can 'support his family' and start he own business.

The soldier, who was originally from Fiji and now lives in Shropshire, was on his second tour of Afghanistan with the Royal Irish Regiment at the time of the attack.

He was second in command of an eight-man British team that was supporting an Afghan National Army (ANA) dompany during the mission to secure high ground above a Taliban stronghold south of Musa Qaleh in Helmand Province.

But when his commanding officer became incapacitated, L/Cpl Toge was forced to take control of the patrol.

The company spent 90 minutes engaged in a firefight with the Taliban before orders came to advance while under heavy fire.

The Warrior vehicle he moved forward with suffered at least 10 strikes by a rocket-propelled grenade.

L/Cpl Toge modestly wrote of the moment he rescued the five comrades injured in the attack. He said: 'I was out for about 10 seconds.

'They were screaming. One had a neck and shoulder injury. I knew I had to extract the casualties - that was my priority. So I went with the ANA medic - we crawled forward, got the guys, pulled them back and patched them up.

'We heaved them on to the back of the Warrior and then continued fighting. The adrenaline kicks in and you prioritise - casualty, objective then yourself. That's what I did. I didn't think about medals - I just thought it was another fight.'

The Conspicuous Gallantry Cross (CGC) is the second highest military medal that can be awarded to members of the United Kingdom's armed forces.

Presented in 'recognition of an act or acts of conspicuous gallantry during active operations against the enemy', the medal was created in 1993 and can be awarded to all ranks of the British Army, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force.

It was introduced after a review of the honours system as part of a drive to remove distinctions of rank in awards for bravery, replacing both the Distinguished Conduct Medal and the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal, and can also be awarded posthumously. 

The CGC is silver and in the shape of a cross with a laurel wreath underneath, and is mounted on a white ribbon with blue and crimson stripes. A recipient's rank, name and unit are engraved on the reverse.

Corporal Wayne Mills was the first recipient of the CGC, after he saved the lives of his patrol by single-handedly holding off a group of attackers which serving in Bosnia in 1994.

Other recipients include Dipprasad Pun, a Nepalese corporal with the Royal Gurkha Rifles who was awarded the honour after he defeated up to 30 Taliban insurgents who were storming his control post in Helmand province in 2010.

Three-time Boat Race winner and Army Captain Robin Bourne-Taylor was awarded the medal in 2010, while Royal Marine Mark Jackson ensured his receipt of the award was an extra-special day by proposing to his girlfriend Rebecca Daniel after the 2011 ceremony.

L/Cpl Toge then led the rest of his troops to higher ground overlooking a Taliban-controlled village and started firing on the enemy before withdrawing to allow British air support to bomb the area.

The citation for his CGC reads: 'Repeatedly, Toge exposed himself to fire disregarding his own safety to keep the ANA going forward. His gallant and inspirational leadership had every man following him.

'He single-handedly, with supreme strength and selflessness, extracted each one from the killing area and dealt with their treatment.

'Toge's actions were truly extraordinary; not least because he was, as a Lance Corporal, commanding a company group of indigenous forces in the most challenging and dangerous conditions, against a determined well equipped and brutal enemy.

'His raw courage, inspirational leadership, tactical acumen and almost superhuman strength are most deserving of official recognition of the highest order.'

Military historian Richard Doherty said: 'Bruce Toge is a man of great character and imposing physical appearance. His actions on that day would have left the likes of Rambo and the Terminator in the shade.'

L/Cpl Toge is selling the medals at Charterhouse Auctioneers of Sherborne in Dorset on March 19, along with his dog tags and

Auctioneer Richard Bromell said: 'The Conspicuous Gallantry Cross is awarded for an act or acts of conspicuous gallantry during active operations against the enemy, being second only to a Victoria Cross.

'Having been instituted in 1993, only 60 CGCs to date have been awarded so they rarely appear on the market, and it is therefore a great honour to be instructed to sell such an important medal by the recipient.'
