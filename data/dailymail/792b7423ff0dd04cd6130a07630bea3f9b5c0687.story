Police are hoping Gary Dobson will agree to become a ‘supergrass’ and testify against fellow, un-convicted, Lawrence gang members, the Mail can reveal.

Detectives believe Dobson – long regarded as one of the ‘weak links’ in the mob – might seek a deal with prosecutors and finally come clean about who else was responsible for Stephen’s death.

Both Dobson and Norris were named by the Mail in 1997 as Stephen’s killers, along with Neil and Jamie Acourt and Luke Knight.

The five have never sued and last night ITV News filmed the Acourt brothers still refusing even to discuss the case.

Details of the circumstances in which convicts can receive a reduced prison sentence, in return for co-operating with the authorities, are spelt out in the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005.

Police believe they have exhausted all opportunities to gather new forensic evidence in the Lawrence case, meaning their best chance of nailing the other gang members is if a new witness were to come forward – or Dobson were to become a supergrass.

Acting Deputy Commissioner Cressida Dick insisted the Met was still not at 'the end of the road' in the search for the remaining killers

It is understood the possibility of Dobson co-operating has already been discussed informally by investigators.

Last night the Met’s Acting Deputy Commissioner Cressida Dick said police would continue working to bring the rest of Stephen’s killers to justice. Detectives have a list of seven remaining suspects for the murder. Their most recent investigation, which coincided with a review of the original forensic evidence, whittled down 187 names of interest to just nine. 

The convictions of Dobson and Norris leave seven still in the frame, including the Acourts and Knight.

And the Mail can also reveal that detectives:

Norris is regarded by detectives as an ‘old-school villain’ who would never snitch. But father-of-two Dobson, whose girlfriend Michelle Lines was blowing kisses to him from the public gallery during the trial, is seen as someone who might be willing to lift the lid on the identities of the other killers.

Because he pleaded not guilty at the murder trial, Dobson would have to come up with compelling new evidence, which can be corroborated, for him to have any chance of a sentence reduction.

A well-placed source said: ‘Police would be happy to talk to Dobson. I can’t imagine he will be too happy knowing that the Acourts and Luke Knight are swanning around Eltham, while he is locked up in jail doing a long stretch.’

The source added: ‘Dobson is now a 
convicted murderer, and by definition (because of his previous stance in
this case), is also a convicted liar. But there are opportunities under
SOCPA for him to receive a lower sentence if he agrees to become a 
prosecution witness.

‘The 
police are not allowed to offer him an inducement up front, merely point
out the existence of the legislation. He could have several years taken
off his sentence if he co-operates.’

Acting Deputy Commissioner Dick insisted the Met was still not at ‘the end of the road’ in the search for the remaining killers.

She said: ‘If we get new evidence, if we have further opportunities, we will respond to that.

‘And
no doubt in the future the case will be reviewed, as other murders are 
if they are unresolved. We don’t see this as the end of the road.’

Former
Detective Superintendent Jill Bailey, who recently retired, said she 
thought there was a chance that the remaining killers could be brought 
to justice.

‘I’m always 
hopeful because there have been quite a number of cases over the years 
from forensic advancements,’ she said. ‘The changing allegiance of 
people who are related to a number of cases, and new information that is
reported to us.

‘So as a 
detective officer involved in a number of cases that are solved many, 
many years after they first occur, of course I’m hopeful.’

An extraordinary outburst from media commentator Rod Liddle almost ended the trial of Stephen Lawrence’s killers before it began.

In breach of a strict court order, he wrote a provocative comment piece which risked prejudicing  the trial of Gary Dobson and  David Norris.

In the article, published in The Spectator three days after the trial started, Liddle wrote: ‘Should we care about these undoubtedly violent, often criminal, certainly unpleasant white trash? That they were (and probably still are)  racists is quite beyond dispute.’

He also included details not known to the jurors concerning Norris’s previous convictions.

The matter was referred to the Attorney General for contempt of court, and Liddle and The Spectator could face criminal charges.

They think David Norris is an 'old school' criminal who won't snitch

Believe a sixth man, possibly blond, may have been in the killer mob. Efforts to identify the suspect could feature in any fresh police probe launched as a result of the murder convictions.

Are still not certain which member of the gang stabbed Stephen.

May seek to charge Dobson’s father Stephen with perverting the course of justice, for allegedly providing him with a false alibi. He was arrested over lying to police ten years ago, but not prosecuted.
