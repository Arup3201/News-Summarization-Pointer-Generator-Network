One of London’s most unique hotels is giving business travellers or holidaymakers the chance to live like the rich and famous, even if it’s just for a night or two.

Sunborn London, the capital’s first superyacht hotel, caters to wealthy or curious travellers who are looking for an extremely rare experience aboard the type of vessel normally reserved for tycoons, pop stars or top footballers.

The glamorous floating hotel – located in the middle of the global city – combines the privacy and exclusivity of a yacht with the quality and comfort of top-class accommodations.

The Sunborn International-owned hotel opened in June at a cost of nearly £40m and it features 136 spacious guest rooms with river and city views, including four executive or junior suites, spread over five decks.

Before guests step foot in their rooms, they encounter an extravagant lobby with a golden staircase as its centrepiece.

At a cost of about £140 to £850 a night, each room is tastefully decorated with modern amenities, including a king-sized bed and sophisticated room control system with one-touch temperature or TV control. 

Some rooms come with private balconies or other exclusive features. The executive suite pampers guests with a sauna and a huge balcony that offers sweeping views.

When guests aren’t relaxing or sleeping in their rooms, they can sit down for a delicious meal in a fine dining room with a river view of the O2 Arena and Canary Wharf.

Guests can sip on drinks in a bar and lounge, and there is space for meetings and events, including a three-level venue with outdoor terraces.

Built without an engine, the 120-metre vessel is permanently moored at the western end of the Royal Victoria Dock in East London, a once gritty area that has become an affluent commercial hub thanks to years of revitalisation efforts.

It is located in a prime location for business or leisure travellers – not far from Canary Wharf, Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, London City Airport, Emirates Air Line and ExCeL London.

Before it opened as a four-star deluxe hotel, the yacht was towed from a shipyard in Finland, completing its two-week journey in April.

Sunborn believes its innovative hotel will become an important landmark in East London and a popular destination for business or leisure travellers. 

It is already looking to grow its presence in Europe.

The company operates a similar hotel in Gibraltar and has plans to open one in Barcelona.
