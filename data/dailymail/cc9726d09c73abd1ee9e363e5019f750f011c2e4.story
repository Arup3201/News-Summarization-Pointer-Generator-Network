Tragedy: Sailor Tindall was found dead inside her home on Saturday

A 41-year-old fashion student was found dead from wounds to her throat and wrists on Saturday, inside her luxury Manhattan apartment. 

Sailor Tindall was discovered lying on her bed with her throat slashed after police were called to check on her.

The NYPD said that they had conducted a 'wellness check' after her concerned parents asked because they had not heard from her.

Police have said they are trying to establish if the death is suspicious and one source indicated to the New York Daily News that they have not found a suicide note.

'Her parents hadn't heard from her in a while, so they called on us to check on her,' a police source said.

However, police sources have also said that no signs of a struggle have been found inside the sixth-floor apartment in Liberty House - where homes can reach up to $1 million.

Friends burst into tears as the body of Tindall was taken out on Saturday by officials from the city coroner's office.

They even unzipped the body bag to give one female friend a last look.

NYPD officers discovered Tindall's body on her blood stained bed at around 5.30pm and a knife was located nearby, said police sources to the New York Daily News.

The medical examiner will carry out an autopsy on Sunday to determine the cause of death of Blinn College graduate - who was studying fashion and design in New York City.

Former students of the progressive college include one-time child actor Henry Thomas who starred as Elliot in Steven Spielberg's E.T. in 1982. 

Tindall, who was originally from Clear Creek in Texas, lived in the state until 2011.
