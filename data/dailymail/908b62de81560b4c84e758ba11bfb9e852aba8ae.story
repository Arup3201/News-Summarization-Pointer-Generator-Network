The Fat One: Suspected drug cartel boss Victor Aguirre Garzón

A suspected drug cartel boss known as 'The Fat One' has been arrested by police in Mexico.

Victor Aguirre Garzón or 'El Gordo' was picked up on Tuesday by Mexico's federal authorities as part of a blitz on criminal gangs.

Mexican police confirmed the arrest of the suspected leader of the Independent Cartel of Acapulco - or Cártel Independiente de Acapulco - in the town of Merida on the country's east coast.

The arrest was carried out as part of a recent crackdown by the country's federal police on criminal gangs in the area, who are accused of crimes including extortion and drug trafficking. 

He was immediately taken to Mexico City and made available to the Federal Public Ministry of the Attorney General’s Office.

It follows the arrest in January of Luis Alvaro Leon Morales 'El Canario', The Canary, from CIDA, who was accused of running the sale and distribution of drugs in the western seaside resort of Acapulco.

Local media reports say former police officer Garzón, is a cousin of the former Governor of Guerrero, Angel Aguirre Rivero

He is accused of crimes including the supplying of drugs for the inmates of 'Las Cruces' State Prison in Acapulco.
