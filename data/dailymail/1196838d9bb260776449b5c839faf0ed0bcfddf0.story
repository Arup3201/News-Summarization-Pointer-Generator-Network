A terrified woman who frantically called police saying there was an intruder inside her home was relieved to discover it was actually a soot-covered duck.

Melinda Costanzo, from North Reading, Massachusetts, said she can now laugh at the incident that initially left her scared for her life on Saturday morning.

She said she was awake in bed after her husband left for work when she heard a massive crash.

'It sounded like
 someone was in the house going through all of our things,' Costanzo told MailOnline. 'I was convinced someone was in the house. I was trembling.'

Caught! Police officer Greg Connolly caught and released a duck who flew into a Massachusetts home through its chimney and was mistaken for a home intruder. It was covered in soot when it was found

Fearful that the intruder might have a weapon, she locked herself and her pet dogs inside her bedroom and called 911.

Dispatchers told her to remain on the line and stay inside the bedroom until police arrived.

Officers reached the house minutes later, checked the perimeter and concluded that there were no signs of forced entry. At that point, they told the pajama-clad Costanzo to meet them downstairs.

'I was greeted by three officers... 
and they asked me if I had a bird,' she said. 'I said, "A bird, no?"Â  One officer 
said, "I could have sworn I just saw a bird fly by".'

Left behind: Homeowner Melinda Costanzo and police said they discovered a perfect silhouette of a bird on the ceiling of the home. Costanzo said this picture shows the silhouette

After letting the officers inside the home, she noted a large black mark on one of the walls - a sooty silhouette of a bird.

Then they went in search of the intruder.

'One of the officers found 
it behind a couch and said it was a duck,' Costanzo said. 'I couldn't believe it. We tried to corner it a few times but it kept walking away.'

After the short pursuit, Police Officer Greg Connolly cornered the soot-covered duck behind 
the couch and carried it outside to the deck, where they posed for photographs.

'I
 was concerned that she was hurt, but I was told that she flew off,' Costanzo said of the intruder.

In
 a statement on their Facebook page, police said Officer Connolly 
released the unharmed duck - which they believe was a Wood Duck - into Swan Pond.

They said they believe the duck got in through an open chimney flue, adding: 'If anyone can positively identify this duck, let us know.'

Costanzo also shared a photograph 
showing the duck's perfect silhouette left behind after the bird 
seemingly crashed into the wall.

Police added: 'The duck, covered in chimney soot, flew 
directly into a vaulted ceiling, leaving the perfect soot, silhouette of
 the flying duck on white ceiling.'

Costanzo said: 'It was terrifying, but I'm glad I can laugh at it now.'
