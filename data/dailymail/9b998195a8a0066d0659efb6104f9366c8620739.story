An elementary school teacher who was fired for feeding an autistic child crayons soaked in hot sauce is being re-instated on the orders of a judge.

The Osceola County School District in Florida has been forced to give Lillian Gomez her job back after a judge rejected its appeal to keep her out of the classroom.

Gomez, who was fired from Sunrise Elementary School last year, will now work in a different school in the district to 'support other teachers' and she will have access to special needs students.

Details have not yet been finalized and the school she will be moving to has not been announced.

Back to work: Lillian Gomez, an elementary school teacher who soaked crayons in hot sauce and gave them to an autistic child, will be reinstated in a job in the school district after appealing her firing

Gomez was fired in February 2012 after school officials learned that she had put crayons and Play-Doh in a cup and soaked them for days in hot sauce. She then put them in a bag that was labeled with his name.

She explained that she had intended to deter the student from eating art supplies, and insisted she had not force fed him the crayons.

Her attorney, Thomas Egan, argued that his client was only trying to help the student.

'I think she made a bad judgment in the way she went about it,' he said. 'But her purpose was good.'

Jose Holguin, the father of the autistic boy, was enraged to hear that she will be returning to the job.

'She proved already that she's a danger inside a classroom,' Holguin told WPTV. 'I've said it and I'll say it again, Ms. Gomez, this is not your path. You are not supposed to be teaching.'

But school officials said Gomez would be welcomed back at Sunrise.

'We lost the appeal, so by law we have to comply by the courts,' school district spokeswoman Dana Schafer told ABC News. 'We don't want to come out and say anything bad about the teacher or say anything to worry parents.'

After Gomez was fired last year, she appealed the decision to an administrative law judge and won. The judge said that while her behavior was inappropriate, she was not trying to punish the boy.

Incident: She soaked crayons and Play-Doh in hot sauce, claiming it was to deter the child from eating them

But
 despite the ruling, the school district refused to take her back, so she went to the Fifth District Court of Appeal in Daytona Beach.

Now a year later, the court has upheld the judge's original 
order, forcing the district to put her back to work.

The school has spent more than $50,000 in legal fees throughout the case arguing that her effectiveness as a teacher was 'severely impaired' following the incident.
