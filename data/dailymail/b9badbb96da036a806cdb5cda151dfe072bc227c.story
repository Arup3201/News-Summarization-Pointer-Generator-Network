A woman accused of killing her husband in a road crash after grabbing the handbrake during a row only did it so she could get out of the car, a court heard today.

Caroline Meeking said she didn't intend to kill partner Alan and just wanted to get away from him in order to let him calm down when the crash occurred near Yeovil.

The pair were on their way home to Somerset from a day's drinking in Bridport, Dorset, when the road accident happened on the unlit A3088 at Montacute, on the evening of August 30 last year.

Trial: Caroline Meeking, right, leaves Bristol Crown court this afternoon

Accused: Caroline Meeking is on trial for manslaughter

Between them, the couple, who had been together for nine years and married for 12 months, had drunk two bottles of Rose wine and four or five pints of lager.

Giving evidence at Bristol Crown Court, 45-year-old Meeking told jurors that the argument began as they took a wrong turning on a roundabout.

'He started shouting at me, calling me "[a] Satnav with no batteries" and a "total waste of space",' Meeking told the jury.

'We were arguing and it just escalated from there.'

Tragic: Alan Meeking, 49, died at the scene of the crash

Meeking claimed she said nothing, hoping her 49-year-old husband - who was more than twice the drink drive limit - would calm down but he carried on.

She said: 'He started talking about my family and my dad. He started abusing me and saying that they are scum.

'I kept saying "Just stop it, just stop it. Just stop the car, I want to get out. I don't want to listen to you any more".

'I was pretty nervous. I just wanted to get out. I just thought if he drove off I could walk home from there or he could turn around and get me once he had calmed down.'

Fighting back tears, she said: 'It seemed like he was going more faster. He had never shouted at me in the car like that before.

'I had never seen him that way before or in that manner in such a confined space for that length of time.

'I thought to myself if I opened the door and jumped out but I thought he was going faster and I couldn't jump out.

'And I thought if I put the handbrake on it would slow the car down and I could get out. He could then go off and do whatever he wanted to do.'

Showing the jury how she pulled on the handbrake, she said: 'I just pulled it up like when you park a car.'

Meeking said that when she grabbed the handbrake she had no wish to either hurt herself or her husband, and had no idea the car would spin out of control.

She added: 'I just wanted to defuse the situation.'

Meeking, who lives in Ilminster, Somerset, denies a single charge of manslaughter.

Bristol Crown Court: The trial is ongoing, with Mrs Meeking denying manslaughter

Meeking denied an accusation from prosecutor Ian Dixie that she had 'jammed' the handbrake on.

He asked her: 'I suggest to you that the truth of the matter is that you didn't stop and think what you were going to do, and you pulled it on without thinking?'

She replied: 'No.'

After pulling on the handbrake, the silver Ford Escort went into a spin and headed side-on at speed into the path of a car coming in the opposite direction.

The driver of the other car had no time to react and the two cars collided shortly before 10.30pm.

Mr Meeking suffered catastrophic injuries and was declared dead at the scene by medics.

Motorists who came to the couple's aid described her shouting repeatedly: 'I am sorry, it's all my fault. That's my husband, it's all my fault.

'He didn't want me no more and I just grabbed the handbrake.

'We were having an argument and he called me a dirty slut and I pulled up the handbrake.'

The witnesses also told police they did not believe Mr Meeking was driving with his headlights on.

The defendant said she had no memory of what happened after the crash but described how she felt later as a 'nightmare'.

She told jurors: 'I was just numb and felt like a zombie. I just wanted to curl up and pretend it was a dream.'

Blood tests carried out afterwards found that Mr Meeking, who was 5ft 9ins and weighed more than 17 stone, had a blood alcohol level of 168mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood.

The legal limit is 80mg per 100ml of blood - meaning he was more than twice the legal drink-drive limit.

The court heard that the speed limit on the road was 60mph and police investigators believe Mr Meeking was travelling 'very close' to that speed when the crash happened.

Meeking said she and her husband, who worked as a vehicle panel beater, had a good marriage and shortly before his death had been to the doctor to discuss IVF treatment after deciding to start a family.

Breaking down in tears, Meeking told the jury: '(Our marriage was) the best thing that ever happened to me. It was all my dreams come true.'

She told the court that they had met in West Drayton in West London but decided to move to Somerset for a 'change of lifestyle'. Together they ran a cattery.

The trial was adjourned until tomorrow when Judge Neil Ford QC, The Recorder of Bristol, will begin summing up.
