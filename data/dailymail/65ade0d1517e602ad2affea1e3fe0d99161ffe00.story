A millionaire couple have launched their own private rescue service ferrying migrants adrift in the Mediterranean to Europe.

Inspired by Pope Francis, Malta-based entrepreneurs and philanthropists Cristofer and Regina Catrambone have spent millions of dollars of their own money on a 140 foot ship, which made its first rescue this weekend.  

The Phoenix 1 picked up 227 migrants, who were floundering on an overcrowded wooden fishing vessel, before handing them over to the Italian Navy.

Tens of thousands make the journey from North Africa every year, often on overcrowded and unseaworthy boats. Many die attempting the crossing. This year more than 90,000 have landed, eclipsing the record year of 2011 when swathes fled the Arab Spring.  

Mrs Catrambone, who is originally from Italy, says she was first touched by the migrants’ plight last summer during a Mediterranean cruise, when she spotted a winter jacket floating on the sea. The captain told her it ‘probably belonged to someone who had not survived the journey.’

But it was when Pope Francis visited the island of Lampedusa, where 366 migrants died in a shipwreck last year, that she felt compelled to act.  She said: ‘I remember an appeal the Pope made after the umpteenth drowning incident off the coast of Lampedusa. He said we must all do our own bit to help others, with the means, resources and abilities we have in our possession.  

‘He said that all those who had the possibility to help the migrants had the duty to do so.

‘His words were at the heart of our initiative’, she said. ‘We could not stand by idly and watch this carnage take place.’

Following the tragedy in October last year, the couple, who also own an insurance company, decided to act sooner rather than later.

They invested an estimated Euro4 million of their own money in the ship, a former expedition vessel, which includes a fully-equipped sickbay, two inflatable fast boats and two helicopter drones armed with the latest imaging technology.

The so-called Migrant Offshore Aid Station launched on Wednesday and aims to provide first aid as well as life jackets, food, water and blankets.  

But inevitably it has already become a means of ferrying migrants across the Mediterranean to Europe.

Mrs Catrambone said: ‘They are desperate people. We want to make sure above all that they do not die in their desperation.’  

She said the couple want to encourage other people with means to take action, ‘especially in this time of crisis when people value money more than human life.’

The ship picked up 130 men, 40 women and 57 children from Palestine and Syria after they ran into trouble in a stretch of sea south of Malta. The group were taken on board and were later handed over to the Italian navy to be brought to Italy.  

The NGO said on Twitter: 'No lives were lost and no injuries were incurred, besides a special needs child who needs insulin and several pregnant women.'
