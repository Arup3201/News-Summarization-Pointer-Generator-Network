Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, wants the 1.35million employees to be part of a national effort to highlight its dangers

NHS staff will be urged to join weight-watching groups and take out gym memberships in the fight against obesity crisis, the chief executive will announce this week.

Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, wants the 1.35million employees to be part of a national effort to highlight its dangers.

He will put forward sweeping changes, including moves to reduce the sale of high-sugar and high-fat products on hospital premises.

During the five-year 'forward view' for the health service, he will also say hospital trusts should offer healthy food for their staff 24 hours a day.

Only a quarter of hospitals offer healthy food to night staff, which means they have to rely on vending machines and microwave meals.

'For the largest employer in Europe, which is dealing with the health of our people, that is appalling,' an NHS insider told the Observer.

A senior NHS source, speaking ahead of Stevens's report, said it was time for the NHS to 'up its game' on obesity.

'We were warned over a decade ago that unless there was decisive action, the NHS would be picking up the tab for a sharp rise in avoidable illness. That warning wasn't heeded and the NHS is now on the hook for 12 years of inaction.

'Obesity has to come off the 'too hard to do' list. The health of millions of children and the sustainability of the NHS depend on a radical upgrade in prevention, starting with the billion-pound problem of obesity.'

Mr Stevens hopes that other public institutions, including schools, will take a similar line.

One in five young people and one in four adults in the UK now suffer from obesity, which each year causes 34,000 deaths and costs the NHS more than £1billion.

Last year almost 11,000 people – 8,000 of them women – were admitted to hospital with a primary diagnosis of obesity.

Warnings about its rise, and spiralling costs, were issued in a government-commissioned report by Sir Derek Wanless in 2002.
