Dignitaries gathered on Flanders Fields today for the unveiling of a monument to the famous Christmas Truce football matches between British and German soldiers during the First World War.

Football Association chairman Greg Dyke joined Uefa president Michel Platini and national and local political figures for the unveiling of the football-themed monument.

A century ago on Christmas Day, German and British enemies left their trenches and headed into No Man's Land in a few scattered locations on the Western Front for an unofficial truce.

They shared greetings, treats, mementoes and a game of football during the unofficial ceasefire. Germans placed trees illuminated with candles on the parapet of their trenches and sang Christmas carols as the war raged on nearby.

Troops from both camps were able to bury their dead who had fallen in No Man's Land, repair their trenches and share cigars during the temporary ceasefire.

For those involved, it was most of all a yearning for a sense of normality, however momentarily, that pushed them over the edge of their trenches, unarmed.

'Suddenly a Tommy came with a football,' wrote Lieutenant Johannes Niemann of Germany, referring to a British soldier. 'Teams were quickly established for a match on the frozen mud, and the Fritzes beat the Tommies 3-2.'

If not fully-fledged matches, other soldier's diaries and various reports also spoke of balls being kicked about in friendship.

'A huge crowd was between the trenches. Someone produced a little rubber ball so of course a football match started,' wrote Lieutenant Charles Brockbank of the British Cheshire Regiment in his diary, which is part of 'The Greater Game' exhibit at the National Football Museum in Manchester.

The proponents of the sport have cherished that day as historic proof that there is little that can better bridge man's differences than football.

Despite fraternisation with the enemy being punishable, the truce was maintained into January 1915, with many testimonies of the lull reported in letters by soldiers to their families.

Soldiers ignored war and celebrated Christmas in peace along several places on the front line, including at Ploegsteert Wood, Comines-Warneton, known as Plugstreet to the British.

In Ploegsteert, Mr Platini addressed a remembrance ceremony before inaugurating a monument in a muddy field at Warneton alongside local mayor Gilbert Deleu.

Platini said: 'This remembrance ceremony pays tribute to the soldiers who expressed, a hundred years ago, their humanity by playing football together.

'They have opened an important chapter in the construction of the European community and gave example for today's young generations.'

Today Uefa president Michael Platini will unveil a monument to the unofficial truce, which was marked by friendly football matches and kickabouts between the sides on the Western Front battlefields

It is hoped the inauguration of the monument, close to British and German trenches, will remind young generations of the major role sport has played in the world's history.

Eckart Cuntz, Germany's ambassador to Belgium, said: 'The message from here was that human beings, if they want to stop killing each other, they can do it.

'Of course, the superiors didn't like it but on some places of the front, (the truce) lasted until even the new year.'

He added: 'Those who were called the enemies, sometimes monsters, they were human beings. Celebrating Christmas together, singing Silent Night, and after that, here in Ploegsteert, it was a British soldier who had as a Christmas gift a football and suggested a football

Until now, this unique event had been marked by nothing more than a simple wooden cross on the side of a windswept field filled with scorpion weed.

At its base, amid wreaths of poppies, lie a smattering of balls and various club pennants, all in remembrance of the Christmas Truce of 1914.

The war had begun on August 4 when the German invasion of Belgium kicked off a series of events which quickly pit the German and Austro-Hungarian empires against Britain, France, Russia and several allies.

Germany swept into most of Belgium and northern France and even threatened Paris before the frontline was settled.

Armies entrenched themselves for most of the next four years. At the time, though, the prevailing expectation on both sides had been to be home for Christmas.

When that didn't happen, an early sense of euphoria quickly made way for unrelenting gloom.

It set the stage for the Christmas truce and those magic kickabouts.

Football players themselves had been involved in the fighting from the early days. Of the 5,000 professional players at the time, about 2,000 joined the armed forces. Sometimes whole line-ups signed up at the same time to create what became known as the Footballers' Battalions.

London club Clapton Orient, now known as Leyton Orient, alone had about 40 players and staff joining the war effort, all following the steps of their team captain.

Scotland's top team at the time, Edinburgh club Hearts, had its whole team join the British army one month ahead of that Christmas, a move which inspired others to join, Peter Francis of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission said. Christmas truce or not, seven members of that team were killed in the war.

One of the first footballers killed in the war was Larrett Roebuck, a Huddersfield defender. After playing for his team in a 1-0 victory at Leicester Fosse early in the 1914-15 season, he left for the Western Front and was killed in action on the eve of the first Battle for Ypres, a few miles from that patch of land in Ploegsteert.

'The story is that he set off running across the field with the machine guns going,' said Roebuck's grandson, Frank Wood. 'His friend saw him go down but he couldn't stop to help him. With the fight like that, you couldn't stop.'

In the week leading up to today's event, teams posed for combined photographs ahead of matches as part of Football Remembers to mark the truce.

The Football Remembers programme is being carried out by the Premier League, the FA, the Football League and British Council and includes work with schools across the UK.

Ken Skates, Wales's deputy minister for culture, sport and tourism, said: 'A century ago when war was so frequent, something magical happened.

'Through Christmas spirit, the sound of war was silenced and soldiers from opposing sides laid down their weapons and exchanged photographs and gifts.

'One of the most remarkable moments in our history was united by a common interest - in football.'

Tomorrow the Duke of Cambridge will attend the Football Remembers Memorial dedication honouring the Christmas story at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire.

William, the FA's president, chose the design for the memorial, by 10-year-old Spencer Turner from Newcastle, with England and Arsenal player Theo Walcott.

Next week, British Army footballers will take on their German counterparts in a match called the Game of Truce at Aldershot Town's stadium in Hampshire - a town with close military links.

Research released by the British Council this year found that the Christmas truce was one of the most recognised moments of the First World War, with more than two-thirds of UK adults aware of it.

Memories of the truce have recently been revived in the Sainsbury's Christmas television advert in which a moment of friendship is shared between a British soldier and a German. 

The Prime Minister today met with a group of young footballers before they travelled to Belgium to play a match at Ypres.

The youngsters and Premier League representatives met David Cameron outside his home at Number 10 Downing Street early this morning.

Mr Cameron brandished a period-style leather football as he spoke with the youngsters at the door to Number 10, before the players lined up for a group photo.
