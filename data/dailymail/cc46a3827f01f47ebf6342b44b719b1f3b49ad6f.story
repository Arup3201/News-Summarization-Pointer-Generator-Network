He has been jabbing his finger at wannabe Apprentices for almost a decade.

But it seems Alan Sugar may be preparing to quit the BBC1 show that turned him into the nation’s most recognisable – and irascible – business tycoon.

The 66-year-old, who is chairman of the Amshold group of companies, may leave to devote more time to his other work, his right-hand man has claimed.

Five candidates are left in this year's series - the ninth - but the opening episode was watched by six million viewers, down on the 8.1million who tuned for the 2008 series opener

Nick Hewer, who sits next to Lord Sugar in The Apprentice boardroom, said he ‘wouldn’t be surprised’ if he left after the tenth series next year.

He told the Radio Times: ‘He won’t get bored. But he is all over this show for 12 months of the year, every task, every aspect of the scheduling, marketing, and press – everything.

‘Don’t think he just pops in, does his little bit and pushes off home. Not a chance. He’s very devoted: possibly, I think, to the detriment of his other business interests.

‘I wouldn’t be surprised if at some point after ten years he said, ‘Actually lads, I think I’ve done my bit.’

Hewer first met Lord Sugar in 1983 when his PR company was chosen to represent the businessman’s company Amstrad. Since then, they have become firm friends as well as business confidantes.

The 69-year-old, who hosts Countdown as well as helping with The Apprentice, said he was ‘only speculating’ about Lord Sugar’s future, but felt the tycoon had ‘done his duty’.

He added: ‘He might say he’s only going to do 11 or 12 series, but then find it hard to walk away because it’s his baby.’

In recent years, The Apprentice has seen 
its audience ratings slump. This year’s opening episode was watched by 
6million viewers, down on the 8.1million who tuned in for the 2008 
series opener.

Hewer said Lord Sugar has been so devoted to the programme it has been to the 'detriment of his other business interests'

Nick Hewer was speaking to Radio Times about the future of the show

The show has brought Lord Sugar other headaches. Earlier this year, he was forced to give evidence to an employment tribunal after a former winner, Stella English, claimed she was treated like an ‘overpaid lackey’ in her prize job. She lost the case.

In 2009, senior Tories called for him to quit the programme after he became Labour’s ‘enterprise tsar’, but he stayed on after agreeing to suspend public activity during the airing of his shows.

Hewer said the BBC should not attempt to replace Lord Sugar with another host if he does decide to leave the show.

He said: ‘People would pay to do that job. But as a broadcaster, the BBC would have a really tough decision whether or not to rest this programme.

‘If Alan Sugar says, “Look, I’ve done my ten years,” or whatever it is, if he thinks he’s done his bit, I think they would be crackers to run it the next year with someone else.

‘Because it’s his show, and he’s made such an impression that you would need to be a suicide merchant to take it on after Sugar in the next year.

‘Rest it for three years, let the memories dim, and then bring it back. But, you know, somebody will say, “Are you mad? We want those eight million viewers,” or whatever it is. It’s a huge show. Nobody wants to say "cheerio" to such a successful format. That will be a hard decision.’

Hewer added the BBC should not attempt to change the format of The Apprentice to try to attract more viewers.

He said: ‘If you have a great format, you tinker with it at your peril, because there’s a little bit of magic in that format. This series has been as fresh as ever, and I think the grit in the oyster is the jeopardy.

‘That someone sat on their squashy sofa in Sunderland who hasn’t got a job can quite legitimately shout at the telly, “Don’t do that, you idiot, I could do better.” That’s the magic.’
