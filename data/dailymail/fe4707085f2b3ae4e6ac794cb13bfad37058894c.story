Plastic road markers may have been responsible for the crash that killed Paul Walker, his family believes.

The Fast And Furious actor's family have reportedly spoken to stunt experts who have claimed that the 2005 Porsche Carrera GT driven by the star's friend careered out of control after hitting the markers - called Botts' Dots.

According to TMZ, sources close to his family said that having visited the site, the experts said that the bumps may have caused the car to hydroplane, causing the driver to lose control.

Actor Walker and driver Roger Rodas died on November 30 when their car hit a pole and tree and caught fire in the Los Angeles suburb of Santa Clarita.

Total devastation: There was little left of the wreckage after impact, with investigators ruling that speed and not a mechanical fault was to blame for the tragedy

They told the family that the car could have lost traction after hitting the bumps, which are used to separate lanes of traffic, and skidded off the road.

The claims come after question marks were raised over the safety of the car itself following the crash.

The 2005 Porsche Carrera GT was being driven by the Hollywood star's friend and business partner Roger Rodas when it crashed in Los Angeles, killing both of them.

It has since emerged that car experts have long expressed concern about the souped-up model's suitability for the road, due to its ultra light carbon-fibre frame and 5.7 litre race-derived V10 engine.

It has a flat out speed of 205 miles per hour and its design is derived from earlier Porsche Le Mans models.

Porsche knew of the car's sensitivity 
when they launched the model in 2004.

According to TMZ, a memo 
circulated to sales staff said of the GT Carrera: 'This vehicle cannot 
drive over a Foster Beer can that is lying on its side.'

The actor's family claims that experts say the crash could have been caused by Botts' Dots in the road - raised plastic markers that separate traffic lanes

His final moments: The heartthrob is pictured in the 2005 Porsche Carrera GT just moments before it careered off the road and hit a tree and a pole, killing him and driver Roger Rodas in a fiery explosion

'You need to be aware of what type of road surface you are on (dips; pot holes, seam heights, etc.)

'The Carrera GT is as close to a racecar as we will ever get, this car has all the disadvantages of a racecar.

 According to the California Department of Transportation, Botts' Dots were invented by Dr Elbert D Botts as a way of making the painted lines that separate lanes in the road last longer.

The plastic raised bumps were eventually made mandatory in California and have since become popular on roads across the world.

There are 20million Botts' Dots on Californian roads.

The dots also alert drivers when they drift out of their lane.

Police have revealed that a second man has been charged with stealing a piece of the wreckage of the Porsche that Walker was a passenger in when he was killed.

Anthony Janow, 25, was released on $60,000 bail following the charges.

Prosecutors say that Janow and 18-year-old Jameson Witty stole a roof panel from the wreck as it was being towed away from the site.

The pair could face up to four-and-a-half years in prison for the offence.

Witty, who is also free on bail, was caught on video stealing the T-top roof of the Porsche right off the tow truck and afterwards he even bragged about the heist by posting pics of the stolen wreckage on Instagram.

The wrecked Porsche Carrera GT was being hauled by a flat-bed tow truck hours after the wreck that claimed the movie star and friend Roger Rodas, who was driving the vehicle when it crashed.

The tow truck stopped at a red light and a male jumped out of a car following it to grab a piece of the car – he then hopped back into his car and sped away, according to police.

The tow truck driver immediately reported the theft.

Walker became famous for his starring role in the Fast And Furious franchise

A search warrant was executed on Thursday, and police found the stolen car panel - a part from the sports car's roof.

Witty has since taken to Instagram to apologize for his actions. 'I wanted to say my intensions for the piece I took off the two truck were to make a memorial out of it. Paul was a childhood idol to me and many.

The investigation into the crash that killed both Walker and Rodas is still ongoing.
