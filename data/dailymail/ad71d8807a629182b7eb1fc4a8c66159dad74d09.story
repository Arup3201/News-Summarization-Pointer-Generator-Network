Everton have announced the signing of free agent Samuel Eto'o on a two-year deal.

The 33-year-old striker was released by Chelsea earlier this summer and has joined the Toffees following the collapse of a move to neighbours Liverpool.

The striker tweeted: 'Officially an Everton player...!!! Let's get ready for a new and ambitious Challenge!!!'

Martinez told the club's official website: 'I met him and we had a very good chat about football in general and I was impressed about the hunger he still has.

'For someone who has achieved nearly everything, he still has the desire he had at 15 when he went to Spain and showed what he could do. For many reasons he has got a point to prove.

'We are very excited and I think Everton is the perfect home for him. The fans will make him ready and feel sharp but we have got to be a bit patient with the fitness levels and make sure he is back to his best.'

Eto'o added: 'I am very happy to be here, I am looking forward greatly to putting on the Blue shirt of Everton.

'I have been very impressed by the style of play Everton adopt. I could see straight away that at this club I will have the opportunity to play football. I had the chance to speak with the manager over the last few days and we agreed that this was what we would do.

'I was impressed with his enthusiasm but also by the knowledge of football that Roberto Martinez carries, his vision of football and how he reads football. I still think I can learn a great deal from him here.'
