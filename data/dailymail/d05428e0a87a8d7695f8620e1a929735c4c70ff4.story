The requirements of a knowledge test which caused controversy after 99 percent of the participants failed have been amended, giving aspiring taxi drivers taking the exam four times as many chances to pass.

The exam is compulsory for all new drivers or those who have been driving for less five years.

Taxi drivers now have eight chances a year to successfully complete the test, following complaints the examination was too difficult, the ABC reported.

Changes to a taxi driver knowledge test means participants will have eight chances to pass the exam

The industry's driver knowledge test was introduced in the Melbourne metropolitan area in July last year but after only six out of 444 driver passed the exam's three modules, the number of times they can take the assessment was increased four times.

Equivalent driver knowledge tests exist in NSW for Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong.

The exam contains components relating to geography and general knowledge. 

So far 17 existing taxi drivers in Melbourne have lost their licence for failing to achieve passable results on the exam.

Describing the results earlier this month as 'very poor' Victorian Taxi Services Commissioner Graeme Samuel told the ABC the difficult and expectations of the test remain the same.

So far the examination has a 99 per cent fail rate, with just six of 444 people who took the test passing

'The test itself hasn't changed, nor has the standard we're requiring of the drivers - those standards remain the same,' Mr Samuel said.

'What we're doing though is giving the drivers four chances to sit the test and we're giving them some assistance in the training by producing a training manual.'

Consisting of three modules, the examination takes in general and geographical knowledge, customer service skills and driver behaviour. Participants are required to answer 55 questions in an hour per module.

Other requirements of success include the driver possessing a 'satisfactory degree' of understanding of the English language.

The test will now go hand-in-hand with the training manual which is available in addition to any other training provided by the cab companies themselves.

The changes in the exam were not an confirmation that the bar was set so high, Mr Samuel told the ABC, and the requirements of the test had not changed.

'What this is doing is saying to drivers that we'll give you greater opportunity to be able to sit for the test,' he said.
