Claire is trying her best to be positive

Claire Thornber is trying her best to be positive. But since a 
back condition left her disabled, incontinent and without a sex life, 
it's hardly surprising she sometimes struggles to see the brighter side.

The
 42-year-old mother of two girls is scraping by on disability benefits 
after having to close a successful cleaning business. Her marriage has 
crumbled. Claire (pictured) doesn't blame her husband, but is furious to
 be facing a lifetime of pain and loss. What hurts most is that it was 
all so unnecessary - clear warning signs were missed.

Claire's
 problem first struck in 2010. She'd been coping with intermittent back 
pain for years, which came on gradually, with no clear cause. Then one 
night, turning over in bed, she felt something suddenly 'go'. 'I woke up
 in agony. I was in so much pain I couldn't breathe.

'I
 thought "this is something quite scary". It felt completely abnormal,' 
says Claire. 'In my buttocks and the tops of my thighs, I could feel 
pins and needles and a heavy feeling.'

With her husband's help, she managed to get out of bed and drag herself into the bathroom.She
 went to see her GP that morning. She'd had an MRI scan only three days 
before, to investigate her back pain - this showed she had a severe 
prolapse, a slipped disc pressing on a nerve. Though
 he hadn't seen the scan, Claire's GP was convinced she was now 
suffering from cauda equina syndrome and sent her to A&E with a note
 saying so.

The cauda equina, 
literally 'horse's tail', is the bundle of nerves at the base of the 
spine. They control feeling and movement in the feet, lower legs and 
'saddle' area - the bottom, genitals, rectum, and bladder. 

Cauda
 equina syndrome is where these nerves become compressed - due to a 
slipped disc, a tumour or  an injury. The result is a 
contradictory-sounding combination of pain and numbness. Surgery
 is the only treatment. If done early enough, this can prevent the 
syndrome from becoming permanent. But in the worst cases, patients are 
unable to walk and rely on a wheelchair.

Many
 face a lifetime of incontinence and sexual dysfunction. While the 
condition is thought to affect 'just' a few hundred people in the UK 
each year, the consequences are devastating. 

With
 her GP's referral, Claire should have been passed to a specialist 
spinal unit when she got to hospital. But the scan results were never 
passed on; instead she was discharged with a diagnosis of 'spinal 
stenosis', a narrowing of the spinal canal. 

She
 says: 'I argued with the junior doctor. I said: "I can't feel my bowels
 or my coccyx. There's something desperately wrong." ' 

By now, the clock was ticking.

Cauda equina syndrome is where nerves at base of spine become compressed

As
 John Reynard, a urology specialist at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, 
explains, the chances of a complete recovery are highest if the patient 
has surgery within 24 hours. 'If a nerve is being pressed on, its blood 
supply is being impaired and it will eventually die. The sooner you 
decompress that, the sooner you ensure it remains viable.' 

In
 the evening, Claire went back to the hospital and was admitted. Cauda 
equina syndrome was diagnosed, and she was rushed to a larger hospital. 

But there were no orthopaedic surgeons free when she arrived, and there was disagreement about the urgency of her case. 

Claire
 was scheduled for an operation first thing the next day, but was 
shunted down the list. It was lunchtime before she went into surgery, at
 least 36 hours after the pain first hit.

'The
 surgery was successful in that I'm not completely paralysed,' says 
Claire. But because she was sent home without a catheter, she suffered a
 bladder and uterus prolapse.

Four
 years on, Claire has been left with partial paralysis of the legs. The 
pain is always there. She is doubly incontinent and unable to work.

But the worst thing, she says, is the loss of sexual function, which ruined her marriage. She and her husband have now divorced.

The NHS trust that treated Claire has admitted liability for failing to pass on her scan and is negotiating compensation. 

But
 she wants to make sure others don't suffer in the same way, and has set
 up the Cauda Equina Syndrome Association to campaign for more awareness
 of the symptoms and better care. Eddie
 Jones, head of medical negligence at JMW, the Manchester firm 
representing Claire, says: 'There seems to be a significant lack of 
education across different specialities. I think we've had 
physiotherapists, GPs, paramedics, junior doctors in A&E, 
orthopaedic surgeons, even neurosurgeons missing the signs.'

This
 has cost the NHS dearly. The NHS Litigation Authority has paid out 
£377 million since 1995 for 159 cases involving cauda equina syndrome. A
 further 180 cases are still being brought. 

The
 Society of British Neurological Surgeons denies there's a widespread 
lack of understanding.

Spokesman Rodney Laing, a consultant neurosurgeon
 at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, says: 'It's always helpful to 
repeat messages, especially to non-specialists, but I don't think there 
is a mass of ignorance about this.'

He
 points instead to the early symptoms being difficult to differentiate 
from the acute back pain that brings thousands of people to A&E each
 year.

'The problem is that 
many patients present in the phase before they have the complete 
syndrome.' Mr Laing adds that sending all the patients with back pain 
and urinary changes for MRI scans would consume huge amounts of NHS 
resources.

Claire Thornber is 
not convinced, and John Reynard agrees. 'I've been involved with 100 
cases now and I get the impression that some doctors don't recognise the
 subtle signs that indicate nerve compression,' he says.

It's
 not just the physical effects that are so devastating. Callers to 
Claire's helpline say the NHS has been slow to recognise the 
psychological shock. 'Men find it very difficult to deal with the fact 
it makes them impotent. I spoke to one man of 29 . . .' she trails off. 

'It's a massive, life-changing thing. Some people never get over it.'
