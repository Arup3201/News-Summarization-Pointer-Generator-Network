It seems Liverpool defender Mamadou Sakho has been watching too much of the Six Nations rugby recently.

Tottenham’s Mousa Dembele turned the 24-year-old with ease near the end of the first-half at Anfield, leaving the Liverpool defender grounded.

However Sakho had other ideas, as he slipped he launched himself at Dembele and proceeded to grab onto the Belgian’s leg in mid-flight, similar to a rugby tackle.

Unsurprisingly Sakho didn’t get away with his desperate defending, picking up a yellow card for his troubles.

Sakho was also culpable in Tottenham’s first goal. There seemed little danger when Erik Lamela picked up the ball 30 yards out.

Then Sakho slipped over trying to keep pace with red-hot Spurs forward Harry Kane, who latched onto Lamela’s pass to slot the ball under the approaching Simon Mignolet.

However that won’t worry the France defender as Brendan Rodgers’ side eventually prevailed 3-2 at Anfield to stay in touch with the top four contenders.
