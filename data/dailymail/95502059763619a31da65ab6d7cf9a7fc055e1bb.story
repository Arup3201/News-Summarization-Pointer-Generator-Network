It was not a job for the squeamish.

Wildlife workers today began the distasteful task of chopping up a dead 20-ton beached whale - with a chainsaw.

The young humpback whale, which had been washed into a public swimming pool before the tide dumped it on a Sydney beach, had to be removed piece by giant piece.

Sick feeling: Park rangers believe the whale probably died three to five days before it was washed up because of natural causes such a respiratory tract infection

Experts from Sydney’s National Parks and Wildlife Service had hoped to be able to move the 35-foot (11m) carcass in one piece to a landfill site for burial, but eventually realised they would have to cut it up.

Wearing white protective suits, gloves and face masks, they started up their chainsaws and began sawing through the blubber. Hundreds of onlookers were kept well away because of the sickening stench.

‘It’s like an entire fish shop has gone off,’ said local resident Fergus Woolveridge, pinching his nose.

Children and their parents were warned that what they were about to see would not be a pleasant sight and they should walk away if they became distressed.

Soon, the sound of chainsaws slicing 
into thick bone filled the air as work began in cutting the carcass into
 five large pieces in readiness for removal.

Park rangers believe the whale 
probably died some three to five days before it was washed up, because of natural causes such as a
 respiratory tract infection.

A relatively thin layer of blubber 
revealed how malnourished and sick the whale had been – on a healthy 
creature it would have been three times as thick.

The sea monster's body washed up on Newport Beach late on Tuesday, after dying on its journey north to warmer climes.

Whale of a stink: The New South Wales wildlife authorities had to remove the rotting carcass urgently because of the putrid smell

Whale beachings are common in Australia,
 but rough seas and a high tide washed the sea creature over a chain safety 
fence and into a beachside saltwater swimming pool.

National Parks authorities had hoped 
the
 whale might float out of the pool area on the next high tide, but 
instead had to bring in chopping and lifting equipment to tackle the 
great beast's hulk.

At 35ft from tail to snout, he is the same length as a London double-decker bus.

New South Wales wildlife authorities 
quickly realised they would need to find a way to remove the rotting 
carcass, which had rapidly started to emit a putrid smell in the heat.

Northern route: Humpbacks are a regular sight along Australia's east coast as they head north to warmer breeding waters in June and July, often coming close to shore when feeding

Humpbacks are a regular sight along Australia's east coast as they head north to warmer breeding waters in June and July, often coming close to shore when feeding.

Whales usually return to feeding waters in Antarctica between September and November.

One swimmer told Australian radio he saw the whale when he turned up for his regular morning dip.

'I swim every day and I'm not sharing my lane with that,' he said.
