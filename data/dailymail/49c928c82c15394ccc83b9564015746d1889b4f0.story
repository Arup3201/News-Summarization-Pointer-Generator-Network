A Texas couple have finally named their quintuplets after giving birth to the healthy babies at a Dallas hospital earlier this week.

Michelle Seals of Maud, a town in the Northeast corner of the state, gave birth to four girls and one boy on Tuesday afternoon at Baylor University Medical Center via cesarean section.

The newborns, now named Mia, Tessa, Brant, Gracie and Rayleigh, ranged in weight from 2 lbs 7 oz to 3 lbs 6 oz, and are all being monitored in the hospital's neonatal intensive care unit.

Steven Seals had previously said that he and his wife had picked out names for the quintuplets but had wanted to wait to see which name fitted which baby.

Happy and healthy: Michelle Seals, seen here in February after being put on bedrest, has now given birth to quintuplets on Tuesday at Baylor University hospital in Dallas

And five makes eight: Michelle and Steven Seals already have a two-year-old boy, pictured

'We are so blessed to have welcomed five
 new members of our family into the world Tuesday afternoon,' the couple said in a statement. 'They are 
all healthy and doing well. We would like to thank everyone for their 
prayers and support.'

The quintuplets, who are the first in the hospital's history, join a two-year-old brother to bring the family's brood to six.

Mrs Seal had been ordered on bedrest as of her 25th week of pregnancy at the end of February, and she told KLTV that feeling her babies move inside her was one of the highlights.

'I love it, it's the best part about being pregnant is feeling them move - except for the one that's in my ribs,' she joked.

Ahead of the birth, her husband added: 'It's happiness, it's fearfulness and I'm scared to death.'

Without going into specifics, Mrs Seal suggested that the multiple birth was a result of previous fertility work.

Different places: Michelle was confined to bedrest at the hospital in Dallas for more than two weeks ahead of the birth while her husband stayed at their home with their son, 200 miles away

Final additions: The couple have been married since 2006 and said that after the quintuplets, they will not be having any more children

'The problems I've had in the past, I had to take medicine and it just worked really, really well and we got five out of it,' she told KTLA in February.

'But one thing about it is we'll have four girls to help us when we're older.'

Mr Seals works at the Red River Army Depot and graduated from Stephen F. Austin State University in 2004.

Mrs Seals, who works as a first grade teacher, attended the University of North Texas and the couple married in December 2006.

The Texarkana Gazette reports that their family was at the university hospital awaiting the birth, with both grandmothers as well as the quintuplet's great-grandmother.
