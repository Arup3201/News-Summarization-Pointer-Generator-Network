Jack Wilshere looks set to return for Arsenal's end of season clash with Norwich after taking part in full training on Saturday.

The midfielder has not played since breaking a bone in his foot on England duty in March, but he could now play a part in the Gunners' final league game before Roy Hodgson names his 23-man squad for the World Cup.

Wilshere was joined by Aaron Ramsey and Abou Diaby, who have both struggled with injury this season, in Arsene Wenger's final session before Sunday's visit to Carrow Road.

The midfield duo are also in contention for a starting berth against Neil Adams' side, although Wenger is already preparing for next week's FA Cup final against Hull.

With fourth place already secured, the Frenchman's attentions are firmly on his side's trip to Wembley and the chance to end the club's nine-year trophy drought.

Speaking to arsenal.com, Wenger said: 'We go there to try to win the game. We want to finish on a high, we want to get 79 points and make it as tight as possible at the top.

'If you get to that level it shows you're ready to fight for the title again. From that basis we want to build on for next season and get over 80.

'Also, in preparing for the FA Cup final, it's important to feel that you play well in the game before.'

Norwich head into Sunday's game effectively relegated, although Wenger believes the Canaries could make an immediate return to the top-flight.

He said: 'They have a good squad, they have these parachute payments that allow you to at least live comfortably in The Championship so they have the chance to come up.

'I like Norwich because they always play good football and play with a good spirit. They are a team who deserves to be in the Premier League.'

Wenger has confirmed that Kieran Gibbs will also be back in his squad after five games out, although World Cup hopeful Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain will miss out again with a groin injury.

The former Southampton star is hoping to be fit to face Steve Bruce's side next week, but Wenger is unsure whether he'll make it.

On Oxlade-Chamberlain's chances of playing a part at Wembley, the Arsenal boss said: 'I donâ€™t know yet. He has not at all practised with the first team.'
