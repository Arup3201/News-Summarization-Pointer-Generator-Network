A woman who regrets an affair with a married man has put a basque he bought her up for auction - and told the full story of its sordid history in the process. 

Sandra von Riekhoff, 40, from London, who is happily married to the father of her three children, put the worn lingerie on eBay in a bid to put her past behind her and move on.

Now a  mother, Sandra says she wants to rid herself of the gifts the 40-year-old gave her when they had an illicit relationship 15 years ago.

She also slams the £400 basque up for sale, calling it a 'piece of tat'. It was sold for £17 last week

Her tongue-in-cheek posting for the £400 Agent Provocateur corset provides a lengthy 500-word description of the product and pokes fun at the man who bought it for her.

She writes: 'It was sold for £400 to 40-year-old man 15 years ago who clearly suffered from an expensive mid-life crisis.'

Now older and wiser, Sandra admits she regrets accepting the gifts and 'betraying his wife'. 

She writes: 'I have shoved this and several other items as listed above in the attic hoping the guilty memories would fade. They don't. I feel rotten for betraying his wife and accepting these gifts, even if she was as rancid as he claimed.

'Fast forward 15 years… I'm 40 now and I have three kids. She was probably doing her best. What 40-year-old woman is still a wildly fun ride with her husband after multiple children?' 

The events photographer reveals the last time she wore the basque was in 2007 - before her 'udders tumbled towards my lower ribs and before the abs were nicely coated in cellulite and sagging skin'.

Not going for a hard sell, she describes the basque up for sale as a 'piece of tat' that 'makes lovely fleshing breasts appear purple'. Remarkably, it sold for £17 last week.

In a interview with FEMAIL, Sandra revealed how she accepted the gift as naive young woman and thought the man was just looking for someone to talk to as he was unhappily married.

'It was about a year of me counselling him over frothy alcoholic cocktails at the Blue Bar in Knightsbridge,' she said.

'I was broke so very glad to play the counsellor in exchange for a chair at London's elite hotel bars in exchange for a good meal and a drink that would have cost a week's wages.'

As well as raking her on expensive dinner dates, he also showered her with gifts including a laptop, several Hermes scarves, a Chanel coat, a Bulgari ring and a YSL dress. 

When he bought the purple basque, Sandra realised he wanted more than just to talk. 

'I like to think that my companionship was really enough for him, but once the underwear started to roll in it was clear that he wanted to work with other body parts too,' she revealed.

'I once let him put his tongue in my mouth which was a revolting experience and managed to use my wits to prevent him from ever doing that again.' 

Their dates were brought to an abrupt end when his wife discovered they had been meeting.  

'His wife found receipts Christmas day and revealed to the entire turkey feasting table what she had discovered,' Sandra said. 

'His phone was confiscated and I was contacted. And that was that.'

Sandra was left with a wardrobe full of designer gifts and a guilty conscience. 

So now she's decided to make something positive out of the situation by selling the items he bought he to fund a new business venture.

'I'm eBaying it all to fund my start-up ourfri.com. It's an app that among other things will help you get good recommendations on where to buy good underwear - for, say, Valentine's,' she explained. 

Sandra has promised to upload more of the gifts onto the online auction site in the near future including a Tom Ford Dress she describes as 'incredibly out of fashion' and a Chanel boucle jacket 'which belongs on some middle aged lunching Botox victim'.

Her Hermes scarf is currently on sale - with all proceeds going to charity. 

'Thank you for looking at this piece of smutty lingerie.

'I have worn it only while drunk. It looks ridiculous otherwise. Try standing with it on, flat foot in broad day-light. It appears desperate.

'It has been used in bed, only man on woman. If you are bi-curious or strictly lesbian, I'm quite sure she might find this frock as stupidly excessive as I did. In fact it's a completely pointless item. 

This ad poked fun at the garment, rather than made it sound sexy

'Chances are that you'll only wear this drunk as well and if you are chances are he/she are in the same boat and will barely notice you have it on. If they do notice, beware, they may want to take a shot of you with their phone and we all understand the dangers of that.

'This piece of wasted time really only pleases the designer who made it. 

'It was sold for £400 to 40-year-old man 15 years ago who clearly suffered from an expensive mid-life crisis. 

'He bought it for the 25-year-old shop girl on Sloane Street he was trying coax to the Savoy with multiple extravagant gifts.

'By the way, I may also eBay a laptop, several Hermes scarves, black knee high boots, a Chanel coat, a Bulgari ring & a TOM FORD for YSL dress from the same benefactor. 

'I have shoved this and several other items as listed above in the attic hoping the guilty memories would fade. They don't. 

'I feel rotten for betraying his wife and accepting these gifts, even if she was as rancid as he claimed. Fast forward 15 years…I'm 40 now and I have 3 kids. She was probably doing her best. What 40-year-old woman is still a wildly fun ride with her husband after multiple children?

'I haven't worn this thing since 2007, before I had the children, before my udders tumbled towards my lower ribs and before the abs were nicely coated in cellulite and sagging skin. It's over. I tried Pilates at £50 a session with a bully instructor. I've tried the roll on 'instant results' stomach spreads you have to import from Spain. Jogging gives you 'jogger's face', that sunken hollow look that may mean you've got a fit body, but hell your face looks like the thing Jack Nicholson groped in room 237.

'This lacy French piece of tat is a reminder that 118lbs will possibly be mine once more just before the mortician decides what shade of beige cake to coat my face in for the 'last view'.

'To quote Shakespeare, 'every dog has its day', mine has past. 

'Perhaps you've still got a few days left. I suggest heels here, dim lights and a bottle of bourbon. I'm not too bothered about what this thing sells for, but if it does fetch anything at all I will use it towards buying a swim costume that cleverly hides the python wrapped around my waist.

'I'm simply relishing the idea of shoving this purple mistake in an envelope and hoping that with it, I can forget how hot I was once and just be happy that I'm still too young for Tena pants.

'Bidding starts at 99p. I will offer free shipping to anyone buying it from at least 10,000 miles away.'
