A quick-thinking woman took a photo of a man who allegedly exposed himself along a beach foreshore. 

The woman, aged in her 40s, was walking her dog along the foreshore path at Sandringham in Melbourne's southeast at 7.30pm on January 3 when she was approached by a man wearing a towel around his waist.

The man allegedly exposed himself and then indecently assaulted the woman when he fled the scene after being disturbed by passers-by, but not before the woman managed to take a photograph of her attacker.

A woman took a photo of this man after he allegedly flashed at her on Sandringham beach on January 3

It is believed the alleged offender may have spoken with an Italian accent and possibly left the area in a silver hatchback.

The man is perceived to be of southern European appearance, aged between 40-50 years old, about 172cm tall with a medium build, bald head and wearing a number of necklaces including a cross.

Moorabbin acting detective inspector Brad Daly praised the victim's brave efforts of taking a photo during the alleged attack.

'It's pretty daunting but she's managed to get it - obviously that's not the full photo - it's been really valuable to us,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

Inspector Daly said it was common for indecent exposure incidents to occur along the beachfront but not typical for indecent assaults to happen in the area. 

'We probably get about one willful and indecent exposure incident a month in summer but it gets quieter in the colder months,' he said. 

'There is quite often someone doing the wrong thing like that but it's different for it to escalate to an indecent assault.' 

Police are appealing for anyone with information to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or submit a confidential crime report at www.crimestoppersvic.com.au.
