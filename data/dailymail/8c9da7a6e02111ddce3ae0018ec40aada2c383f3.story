A young woman has filmed herself speaking gibberish in a string of different accents to show how people speaking foreign languages sound - at least to her.

Nineteen-year-old Sara from Finland uses her remarkable skill for mimicry to show what different languages sound to foreigners who don't understand them.

Her caricatures are so good that, to anyone who doesn't know the languages she is imitating, she could almost be a fluent speaker.

Body language: Sara adopts the distinctive grin of a California girl as she mimics the U.S. accent

Her British accent is pure London youth, complete with a sprinkling of 'innits' and glottal stops in the place of her 'tee' consonants, while her American accent is reminiscent of California.

Like all the best mimics, she even replicates the body language of the cultures whose language she's imitating.

Sara, who doesn't give her surname, says that her video is just her 'goofing' around and cautions viewers not to take it too seriously.

Nevertheless some people appear to have taken offence.Â 

'I don't even know': Nineteen-year-old Sara, who doesn't give her surname, says that her video is just her 'goofing' around and cautions viewers not to take it too seriously

In her defence, she writes: 'I know some of them suck, but that's kinda the point cus I don't understand two sh**s of that particular language and thats why it sounds like jibberish to me.

'Also, named one of them Pizza because I knew it was so bad, that if I had called it Italian i would've gotten my a*** crucified.'

She adds: 'I'm not trying to speak any languages in this video. My point is only to bring out what the languages sound like to me'

The video was uploaded to YouTube on Monday and has quickly gone viral, racking up a phenomenal 4.75million views in just five days.
