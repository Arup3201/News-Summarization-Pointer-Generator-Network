The Fabio Borini saga is not dead with Liverpool wanting to reach a deal where the Italian joins Sunderland on a permanent basis.

AC Milan are interested in a loan for the Italian striker but Liverpool would prefer to recoup the £12million they paid for the striker in 2012.

Getting Borini on a temporary basis wouldn't be an option for Sunderland anyway once they complete the loan signing of Uruguay defender Sebastian Coates, also from Liverpool.

Loan star: Borini scored seven times for Sunderland on loan last season, and now they want him back

Value: Liverpool want to get a return on the £12million they spent on Borini, rather than letting him leave on loan

Premier League rules don't allow clubs to sign more than one player on loan from the same team. It will depend on Liverpool and Sunderland agreeing a fee and the player being happy with his personal terms.

Meanwhile, Brendan Rodgers will allow winger Oussama Assaidi to join Stoke if he can agree personal terms. 

On his way: Sebastian Coates is on the verge of joining Sunderland on loan from Liverpool

Connection: Gus Poyet is keen to sign his fellow Uruguayan who hasn't made the breakthrough at Anfield
