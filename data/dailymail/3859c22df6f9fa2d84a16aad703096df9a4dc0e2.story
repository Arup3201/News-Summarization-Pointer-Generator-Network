Another day, another survey revealing exactly what makes women tick.

Yes, while we were labouring under the impression that having exceptional academic aptitude, winning the right to vote and running a business were some of the wonders of being a modern woman, apparently we couldn’t be more wrong.

According to a new survey titled Seven Wonders of The Modern World, Facebook, hair straighteners and parking sensors are the elements of our modern times that leave women most awed.

David Beckham's famous six-pack, pictured here, made it onto the long list of Modern Day Wonders

Put the kettle on: Tea (right) was voted the seventh 'modern wonder' by a UK survey, Seven Wonders of The Modern World, whilst hair straighteners (left) came third in the UK poll

Fancy a bite? Chocolate (left) was voted fourth by women as their favourite 'Modern Wonder' in a UK poll, whilst iPhones (right) were men's first choice

The results, compiled from a survey of 2,000 responses, contain everything from beauty items, food, gadgets and famous faces.

Other ‘modern day wonders’ for women include chocolate and Sat Nav.

Contactless payment, where you can pay for your purchase in a matter of seconds, and a steaming hot cup of tea also made it on to the list.

Just outside the top seven were Coronation Street, push-up bras, David Beckham's six pack and control pants.

By contrast, the same poll found that modern man's Seven Wonders includes the iPhone, Sky+ and Holly Willoughby’s breasts.

The Xbox, Kelly Brook's curves, 3D movies and a cold pint of lager were also on the list for men.

On the fringes of the men's top seven were Barcelona striker Lionel Messi, the 1998 movie Die Hard and electric shavers.

Steve Kitson of Kia Motors UK, which carried out the poll, said: 'Parking sensors have made the troublesome parallel park a thing of the past, so we aren't surprised they've been listed as one of the average woman's Seven Wonders of the Modern World.

‘It’s clear women can’t go without a decent cup of tea and a bar of chocolate - so these things have definitely earned their Seven Wonder status.'

Kiston went on to say that men are ‘more reliant on technology and gadgets’ with the iPhone, Sky+, 3D movies and Xbox all making their list.

Back in the real world, the survey also found that well over half of the respondents said the real, ancient Seven Wonders of The World could do with modernising - and revealed that there was some confusion over the genuine articles.

One quarter thought Niagara Falls was one of the ancient Seven Wonders and nearly half were under the impression that the Great Wall of China had been granted the special honour.

Worryingly, clueless Brits also thought London Zoo, Stonehenge and the Empire State Building were on the list.

1. Great Pyramid of Giza

2. Hanging Gardens of Babylon

3. Statue of Zeus at Olympia

4. Lighthouse of Alexandria

5. Colossus of Rhodes

6. Temple of Artemis at Ephesus

7. Mausoleum at Halicarnassus

1. Grand Canyon

2. The Great Barrier Reef

3. The Harbor at Rio de Janeiro

4. Mt. Everest

5. Northern Lights

6. Paricutin Volcano

7. Victoria Falls

... but many women may find the superficial list rather patronising
