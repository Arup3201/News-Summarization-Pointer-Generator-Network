A four-year-old boy was allegedly beaten to death with a belt by his mother and step-father after a computer glitch at the Department of Child Services failed to pick up abuse claims against them, it has emerged.

Little Ty'Reke Evans, from Chattanooga, Tennessee, died in December 2011 with rib fractures, lacerations to his liver and bowels, needle punctures, brain swelling and bruises and welts that looked as if he had been beaten with a belt, doctors said.

Ty'Reke's younger brother, who was then three, was also admitted to hospital with liver abrasions and bruises to his body but survived. He is now in protective custody.

Their mother, Patricia Brewer, 25, and her boyfriend, Kenneth Coleman, 23, have been charged with child abuse, child neglect and murder and are due in court for a preliminary hearing on Monday.

Victim: Four-year-old Ty'reke Evans was beaten to death in December 2011 even though the Department of Child Services in Tennessee had received numerous calls about potential abuse

It has now emerged that the DCS had received calls about the family, but that a glitch in the computer system meant staff did not connect the cases, the Tennessean reported.

In the weeks before Ty'Reke's death, the DCS received at least three claims of child abuse from family and pre-school teachers - with one noting his bruises and saying the 'situation is escalating'.

But one child abuse report made on November 11, 2011 was given to one caseworker, while two further reports made on December 7 and December 8 were given to a different worker.

It meant that the two caseworkers were unaware of the other calls or that the family was already under investigation; if they had known, there could have been swifter actions, the paper noted.

Accused: His mother, Patricia Brewer, and her boyfriend, Kenneth Coleman, were arrested after the death

DCS records point out that there were 'technical challenges' with the $27 million data system, the Tennessee Family and Child Tracking System or TFACTS.

'The TFACTS system, for some reason, did not make the connection when the reports came in,' read the records. 'With the volume of referrals that are assigned on a daily basis there were no opportunities to make the connection.'

The records also show that some entries showing the department's investigation of the family were not entered into the system until five months after the boy's death - rather than the 30 days required.

Spokesman Rob Johnson told the paper that some records show that staff had been meeting with law enforcement and prosecutors, who were deciding whether to go ahead with criminal charges.

TFACTS, which was created in August 2010,
underwent a $4 million system upgrade after legal advocates complained 
its problems had reached a 'crisis' stage.

Hurt: Ty'reke's little brother Donamiche also suffered lacerations and bruising but survived

Other issues included failures to issue payments for foster families or being unable to track child deaths.

Children's Rights noted there had been significant improvements earlier this year.

Brewer and Coleman will appear in court on Monday to hear if they will be tried separately.

Ty'Reke's biological father is now seeking custody of his surviving son.Â 

His attorney, Tabitha Finch, said: 'I am very disappointed by how this case has been handled by DCS. People look to DCS for protection for children. If policies had been adhered to, this situation may have ended differently.'

Brewer's attorney said she was a caring mother who did not harm her children.
