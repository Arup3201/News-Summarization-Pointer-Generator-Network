It weighs six tons, it’s spinning out of control and it’s going to plunge back to Earth some time this month.

Nasa estimates that there’s a 1 in 3,200 chance that pieces of the defunct satellite could hit someone when it plunges from orbit. It would be the first time in history someone was injured by space debris.

The Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite, or UARS, ran out of fuel in 2005 and could land on any of six continents. NASA says it could land at any point between 57 degrees north and 57 degrees south - which includes almost all the populated areas of our planet (see map below).

Most of the satellite will burn up 
during re-entry, but a hefty half-tonne of metal will still plummet to 
the Earth’s surface.

Danger: The six-ton Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite will crash to Earth and could land in Britain

The satellite could fall anywhere between the two latitudes, where billions of people live

It’s being tracked by the Joint Space Operations Center of U.S. Strategic Command at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, but Nasa admits it has no idea where it will come down, or when.

It predicts that it will enter the atmosphere in late September, but it could be October.

The space agency said that the crash site will be anywhere between 57 degrees north latitude and 57 degrees south latitude and the remains could scatter over a 500mile area.

That means pieces of it could land in Scotland – or somewhere in Chile.

Astronomer Dr Ian Griffin, from the UK Association of Science and Discovery Centres, says the Earth's atmosphere slows down falling satellites a great deal.

He explained that what remains of UARS will hit the ground relatively slowly and 'certainly not at orbital velocity of 17,500mph'.

Much of any satellite crashing to Earth will be disintegrated by heat, caused by friction with the atmosphere. It's the reason we get shooting stars - created by meteors burning up in the upper atmosphere. UARS is large enough, though, that up to half a ton will strike the ground. It will probably not be in one piece, however:  space vehicles experience incredible stress on re-entry. The load can be as much as 10Gs. An F1 car experiences around 5Gs with maximum braking from high speed.

The reason why the location of the crash site is so hard to predict is because the density of the atmosphere varies so greatly higher up, producing different amounts of drag.

A prediction that was wrong by even a few minutes would mean the satellite landing a huge distance away, owing to its speed.

However, a Nasa spokesman pointed out that there has yet to be any reported injury from falling space debris.

He said: ‘The risk to public safety or property is extremely small, and safety is NASA's top priority. Since the beginning of the Space Age in the late-1950s, there have been no confirmed reports of an injury resulting from re-entering space objects.

‘Nor is there a record of significant property damage resulting from a satellite re-entry.’

This satellite is far smaller than 
the 135-ton Russian space station Mir, which fell to Earth in 2001 or 
the 100-ton Skylab that fell in 1979.

Mir
fell into the South Pacific, while Skylab hit the Indian Ocean and 
parts of sparsely populated western Australia. Because two-thirds of the
Earth is ocean, space debris usually hits water.

Nasa is urging anyone who finds a piece of the UARS satellite not to touch it.

The
spokesman added: ‘If you find something you think may be a piece of 
UARS, do not touch it. Contact a local law enforcement official for 
assistance.’

It was launched
back in 1991 by the Space Shuttle Discovery to measure ozone levels, 
wind speeds and temperatures in the stratosphere.

But now it’s one of 370,000 pieces of junk floating in space at speeds of up to 22,000mph.

The volume of debris was greatly increased by a 2007 Chinese anti-satellite weapon test and a 2009 crash-in-orbit of two satellites.

The widely criticised Chinese test used a missile to smash an aging weather satellite into 150,000 pieces of 1cm debris and 3,118 pieces can be tracked by radar on the ground.
