This is the moment a menacing great white shark swims straight for divers, jaw wide open and teeth bared... and ends up headbutting the diving cage.

In an incident that would leave any human cringing with embarrassment, the predator missed the bait it was aiming for and crashed head-first into the protective enclosure.

Canadian Jeremy Stewart was holidaying in South Africa caught the shark's mishap on camera during a diving excursion in Gansbaai - ominously nicknamed 'Shark Alley'. 

Moving in for the kill: A Great White shark heads straight for a diving cage in Gansbaai, South Africa

Lunch time: Jaw wide open and razor-sharp teeth bared, the 10-foot long predator prepares to hunt

Ouch! The shark misses the bait (and the divers) and collides with the protective enclosure

The Vancouver native was left awestruck when he came face to face with the 10-foot long great white underwater.

He said: 'I was pretty confident the cage would protect us and the shark didn't seem interested in us. It was just going after the bait.

'For the most part I was calm, it was amazing to see these awesome creatures in the wild.

'However the moment when it hit the cage I got to feel its incredible power. For that second I don't know what I was thinking I just wanted to get out of the way.'

Tourist attraction: The incident occurred during a cage-diving excursion in Gansbaai

Exhilarating: Cage-diving with Great White sharks is a popular tourist activity in 'Shark Alley'

Jeremy added: 'You're pretty safe as long as you keep all your limbs inside the cage.

'But you forget all that when its swimming right at you with its huge jaws of serrated teeth.'

And despite his close encounter, the 36-year-old computer animator admitted that the experience did not discourage him from going back into the water.

He said: 'It didn't stop me from going surfing the next day in Jeffreys Bay which is about a day's drive down the coast.

Hunting grounds: There is a large population of sharks in the region, making it popular with sight-seers 

Shark Alley: The channel near Dyer Island  is a magnet for sharks hunting seals who reside there

'I tried to capture as much of this once-in-a-lifetime experience as I possibly could. Hopefully I get to do it again one day.'

Gansbaai is a popular tourist destination in Western Cape of South Africa. 

The channel between two  islands off its coast, Dyer Island and Geyser Rock, is widely known as 'Shark Alley' as it is a common hunting ground for sharks, who come to feast on the Cape fur seals who reside on Dyer Island.

The region is renowned as one of the best commercial cage-diving destinations in the world, and after Kruger National Park, attracts the most tourists to South Africa of any other activity.
