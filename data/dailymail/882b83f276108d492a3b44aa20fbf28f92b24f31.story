A thief stole a tablet computer from a charity shop – only to return it eight days later because he couldn't get it to work.

Christopher Hooson took the £50 Android gadget from a window display but didn't know it needed more equipment to make it work properly.

After failing to get it to do what he wanted, he tried to 'donate' it back to the store.

Staff at the Jonny Kennedy charity shop in Whitley Bay recognised him from CCTV footage and called the police.

Lynne Russell, prosecuting, said the offence happened on November 11.

She said: 'The defendant went into the Jonny Kennedy charity shop on Park Avenue. Once in there, he removed a computer tablet, valued at £50, which  was in the window display.

'He put it in a carrier bag and left the shop.

'Eight days later, he returned to the same charity shop. He returned the stolen computer tablet.

'Because of CCTV, he was then identified by staff and arrested.'

Ms Russell added: 'He was taken to the police station. He admitted taking the item. He said he saw it in the window and thought it would be cheap or free, as it was in a charity shop, so took it.

'He took it and realised it didn't work without further equipment, so returned it to the shop.'

Hooson, of Sunderland, was representing himself in court.

He said: 'I didn't intend to steal it. I forgot I had it in my bag, so I returned it when I noticed.'

But District Judge Begley didn't accept Hooson's excuse and said: 'How do you walk out of a shop having put it in your bag and not notice?'

Hooson replied: 'I know, it sounds ridiculous, doesn't it?'

District Judge Begley said: 'That's not what happened, is it?' 

After hesitating, Hooson replied: 'No.'

Fining Hooson £75 for the offence, District Judge Begley said: 'It's not very nice to steal from a charity shop.

'At least some sense eventually returned to you and you returned the item. However, it is a particularly mean offence.'

Hooson was also ordered to pay £85 costs and a £20 victim surcharge.

The shop was set-up in 2006 in honour of Jonny Kennedy, who died 10 years ago from the rare skin condition epidermolysis bullosa which causes the skin to blister and peel, and all proceeds go to fellow sufferers.

Speaking after the case, Eric Duffield, charity co-founder and trustee, said: 'The judge was really good and seemed pretty angry. I was pleased he got more than just a small slap on the wrist.'

The shop has been targeted by a number of thefts and break-ins in recent years. There have been more than 12 thefts and break-ins since 2009, including burglars grabbing more than £400 from the till and a string of shoplifters making off with everything from a Playstation 2 and 16 games to a leather jacket off a mannequin.

It prompted Mr Duffield to install £4,000 of CCTV equipment.
