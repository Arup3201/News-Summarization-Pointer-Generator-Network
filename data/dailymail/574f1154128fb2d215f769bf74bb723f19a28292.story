He said: ‘You have the good, the bad and the ugly. Some are really cute and nice, and others have the look of “don't touch or I'll bite”.

‘There are others that will look at you and want to bite your head off, which is kind of cool when they are not much bigger than your hand.

‘A few in every bunch will come out and bite you but their teeth are so tiny you'll barely even feel it. They are born to be bad.’

There are estimated to be between 200,000 and 300,000 of them worldwide, according to National Geographic.

They generally live in freshwater parts of eastern India, south-east Asia and northern Australia, and eat the likes of monkeys, water buffalo and even sharks.

Entry to Crocodylus Park, which opened in August 1994, costs £23 for adults or £11.50 for children.
