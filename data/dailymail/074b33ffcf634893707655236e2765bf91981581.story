The FBI arrested two men in connection with a gun plot in Ferguson days before a grand jury is expected to decide whether officer Darren Wilson should be indicted for shooting dead unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown, it has emerged.

Detectives detained Brandon Orlando Baldwin and Olajuwon Davis after the pair allegedly plotted to distribute illegally purchased firearms in the city marred by violent conflict and racial divides, according to court documents seen by CBS. 

It came days before President Barack Obama issued an appeal to the people of Ferguson to remain calm as unrest that has lasted more than three months shows no sign of waning.

Anger was high - on Thursday it emerged Wilson has said he feels 'confident' he won't be charged by the grand jury and is working with city officials to negotiate his resignation from the Ferguson Police Department

The FBI has sent nearly 100 additional agents to the Missouri city to help law enforcement there as officials prepare for possible outbursts of violence when the jury decision is announced.

The National Guard is also in force and hordes of civil rights lawyers are making their way to the city, while a number of schools are preparing to close for fear of dangerous clashes.

Protesters in Ferguson have been threatening to rape the wives of front line police and kill their children during the latest clashes, the wife of one officer has claimed. 

A grand jury has been meeting for weeks to hear evidence on the incident and expect to reach a conclusion in the next few days. 

Authorities fear the result could refresh violent protests across the city which have shown no sign of waning since the shooting on August 9. 

Protests over the shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown more than three months ago have spread across the US. 

Today, as Ferguson braces itself for an imminent decision on whether gunman Officer Darren Wilson should be indicted, demonstrators in Washington (right) staged mock lynchings, in reference to the alleged racism of American police. 

In a desperate plea for calm, Obama told ABC News in an interview on Friday that using any event as an excuse to carry out violence is unacceptable. 

'I think first and foremost, keep protests peaceful.

'This is a country that allows everybody to express their views, allows them to peacefully assemble, to protest actions that they think are unjust,' Obama said. 

'But using any event as an excuse for violence is contrary to rule of law, contrary to who we are.'

Demonstrations resulting in hundreds of arrests have broken out across the US in the last three months.

Appeal: President Barack Obama said protesters should not use the shooting as an excuse for violence

An unnamed woman said that her husband, a police officer, has been 'screamed at' as he faced off with the angry crowds amid heightened tensions in the suburb of St Louis, Missouri.

She told Fox 2 News that they threatened a home invasion in an apparent attempt to provoke the officers.

The wife claimed the protesters said: 'We're going to go to your house. We're going to rape your wives then we're going to kill them and we're going to kill your children'. 

The allegations comes after many police officers' families in Ferguson, Missouri, were reported to be in hiding or running from town amid death and assault threats. 

One police wife told KTVI that she's received threats over the phone and she's been paranoid for her and her young daughter's safety ever since.

'Did they follow me here?' she told the station. 'Did I do a good enough job after work today of taking different routes, on my way home?' 

St Louis County police spokesman Brian Schellman alluded to the abuse in his latest press release on the three arrests made on Thursday night.

He wrote that 'several vocal and defiant protesters arrived chanting derogatory phrases'.

They also made 'insulting personal verbal attacks on officers', he said.

Tensions are rising in Ferguson as a grand jury decides whether to charge white Officer Darren Wilson in the August shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown, 18.

In one recent message, a caller says: 'Would you rather hear me coming out, coming out and robbing your house? And it would be like, it'd just be like silence man, you couldn't hear nothing.'

'It's very frightening,' said the police wife, who asked to not be identified.

'Most people who have a family member who's a police officer are very proud of what they do.'

She added: 'This is real and people actually do know how to find us and they do want to harm us.'

The police wife says some officers' relatives have been leaving town to protect themselves — but she plans on staying.

'I'm very worried about what's going to happen to the citizens and what's going to happen to the businesses and what's going to happen to the police officers,' she told KTVI.

'This is a good community with a long history and they love their community.' 

The unrest has highlighted severe racial divides in Ferguson where the predominantly African American city is patrolled by a majority white police force.

Violence: Hundreds of people have been arrested in Ferguson during protests over racial divides in St Louis

A U.S. official said on Friday that the agents will supplement the law enforcement presence in the next few days as a number of schools prepare to close down for fear of violence.

The official was not authorized to discuss the FBI plans by name and spoke on condition of anonymity. 

About a dozen protesters gathered again outside the police station in Ferguson in frigid conditions Thursday night, sometimes blocking vehicles as they waved placards and chanted 'Whose streets? Our streets!' and 'Killer cops have got to go!'

Officers in helmets and shields were deployed after a commander told protesters not to block traffic.

Brief scuffles broke out and at least one woman and a man were handcuffed and taken away.

Police did not confirm an official tally. The Chicago Tribune reported at least six were arrested.

Wilson's camp has said he feels 'confident' he won't be charged by the grand jury and is working with city officials to negotiate his resignation from the Ferguson Police Department.

Jeff Roorda, business manager for the St. Louis Police Officers' Association, said he met Thursday with Ferguson officer Darren Wilson, who has remained secluded from the public eye since the shooting.

'It's fair to say that neither he nor his defense team expect an indictment,' Roorda said.

Meanwhile, Wilson may announce  his plans to resign from the force before the verdict, as a way of protecting fellow officers and easing pressures in the wake of the shooting.

Obama's comments on the unrest came after Brown's father and Attorney General Eric Holder also made separate appeals.

'Thank you for lifting your voices to end racial profiling and police intimidation, but hurting others or destroying property is not the answer,' the victim's father, Michael Brown Sr, said in a somber video plea.

'No matter what the grand jury decides, I don't want my son's death to be in vain.'

In the United States, grand juries meet in secret to review some cases before deciding whether criminal charges should be brought.

The jury could indict Wilson, meaning he could face trial, or determine there is no case for him to answer. 

Authorities have previously said they expect the grand jury decision any time between mid- to late-November.

Holder, America's top law enforcement official, released a video urging restraint from his subordinates if people take to the streets.

'Over the past few months, we have seen demonstrations and protests that have sought to bring attention to real and significant underlying issues involving police practices, implicit bias and pervasive community distrust,' Holder said.

'This is the hard work that is necessary to preserve the peace and maintain the public trust at all times, particularly in moments of heightened community tension.'

Brown, a high-school graduate planning on attending technical college, was shot at least six times by Wilson. His body was left in the street for hours.

Wilson has reportedly told the grand jury he acted in self-defense after tussling with the youth. Others claim Brown had his hands up in the air when he was shot.

Some demonstrators complained that police used undue force during peaceful protests and there was widespread criticism of the military-style equipment and uniforms deployed by local officers.

In his video plea, Brown's father appealed to locals to come together.

'We're stronger united. Continue to lift your voices with us and let's work together to heal, to create lasting change for all people regardless of race,' he said.
