Two police officers have been found not guilty of allowing a mentally ill man to die in front of them after detaining him in his home.

PCs Maurice Leigh and Neil Bowdery, of Kent Police, both denied misconduct in public office over the death of paranoid schizophrenic Colin Holt.

Mr Holt, 52, died from positional asphyxia at his flat in Gillingham, Kent, on August 30, 2010 after the officers were called to return him to hospital under a Mental Health Act order.

It was alleged at Maidstone Crown Court that Leigh, 54, and Bowdery, 29, failed to reposition Mr Holt and check on his welfare after he stopped struggling as they detained him.

Today both officers were cleared, a court official confirmed. In a statement following the case, Kent Police said: 'The death of Colin Holt is a tragedy for everyone concerned. Kent Police offers its sincere condolences to Mr Holt’s family and friends.

'This has been traumatic for the officers concerned and this case underlines that policing is often a difficult job, sometimes carried out in very difficult circumstances.'

Mr Holt’s sister, Sharon Holt, said after the acquittal that changes needed to be made to the way vulnerable people are treated.

She said: 'We still have many unanswered questions about what happened to our brother and how he came to die in these circumstances.

'It has been a long and hard wait for answers and we hope that an inquest will follow quickly.'

Deborah Coles, from the charitable organisation Inquest, said: 'This is a very disappointing verdict for Colin Holt’s family but this was an important prosecution.

'The case raises stark questions about the treatment of people with mental illness by both the police and mental health services.'

The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) carried out an investigation into Kent Police’s actions in the circumstances leading up to Mr Holt’s death.

Following today’s verdicts, IPCC commissioner Mary Cunneen said: 'This is a desperately sad case and my thoughts go out to Mr Holt’s family and friends.

'We await Kent Police’s response to our investigation report and will prepare for the inquest in due course.'
