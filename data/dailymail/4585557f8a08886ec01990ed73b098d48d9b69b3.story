These shocking pictures reveal the filthy conditions at an 'exclusive' wedding venue which has been ordered to pay more than £60,000 for breaching food hygiene and safety laws.

Davenport Green Hall in Altrincham, Manchester, charges £14,500 for a couple's big day and has even been featured on Celebrity Four Weddings for glamour model Michelle Marsh's reception.

But bosses have been fined £39,000 plus £21,500 in costs after investigators found the kitchen in a 'shocking' state and said routine cleaning had been 'inadequate'.

Prohibition notices were also served for serious health and safety breaches concerning the gas, electricity and the slippery kitchen floor.

A wedding guest tipped-off environmental health officers after a reception at the venue.

And when officers arrived unannounced in August last year, they found the marquee kitchen and tented areas at the hall were in a very poor structural condition.

They also noted that staff were not trained properly, there was no hand washing facilities, the drains were blocked and rubbish was not being thrown away quickly enough.

Owner Mohammed Isaq has now been banned from running any food business until further notice.

Davenport Green Hall Ltd pleaded guilty to ten food hygiene and two health and safety offences at Trafford Magistrates' Court.

The company agreed to voluntarily close the marquee after environmental officers first visited in August 2013 and said it would not re-open until improvements had been made.

Prohibition notices were served for serious health and safety breaches concerning the gas, electricity and the slippery kitchen floor 

These included supplying hot and cold water to the sinks, fitting a hand basin and cleaning and disinfecting the kitchens.

But even after these initial improvements, follow-up visits revealed that hygiene standards had deteriorated once again.

Officers then served six hygiene improvement notices for the lack of training, lack of food safety management systems, poor refuse storage and lack of pest control.

Bosses describe the privately owned Grade II listed historical estate as Cheshire's 'Jewell in the Crown' on their Facebook page.

'Be prepared to be shocked from the moment you enter this magnificent venue and the dream commences,' it said on their website.

Trafford council's executive member for environment and operations, Councillor John Reilly, said: 'A wedding is one of the most important days in people's lives and couples will often spend a large amount of money to ensure that they have the perfect day.

'When people eat out they will expect, as a minimum, that their food is prepared in hygienic, well-managed kitchens. The fact that these poor standards of hygiene and safety were found at a wedding venue is particularly shocking.

'We expect all food businesses to take food hygiene and health and safety very seriously, to do everything they can to protect their customers from food poisoning and to ensure the safety of their staff and visitors.

'We will work with businesses to help them improve and maintain standards, but we will not hesitate in taking formal action against those who put the public or their employees at risk.'
