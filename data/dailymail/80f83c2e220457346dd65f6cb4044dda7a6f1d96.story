Robin van Persie has revealed he has been playing in pain for the past six years.

The Manchester United and Holland forward, who has admitted to having an issue with his groin over the last few days, says he can't really recall a match in which he was free of aches and pains.

Speaking at a press conference on Sunday ahead of this summer's World Cup, Van Persie said: 'I've been playing in pain for the last five or six years; every single game.

'I can't really think of one game where I didn't have a niggle or pain somewhere.

'I'm used to that. I know, together with the team and with the medical staff, how to deal with that.

'I'm the one who looks at that and manages that.'

The comments come after the Holland talisman was withdrawn at half-time during the 2-0 win over Wales last Wednesday as a 'precaution'.

However Van Persie insisted the niggle to his groin wasn't serious and said: 'You can't really even call it an injury'.

The United striker also missed six weeks towards the end of last season with a knee injury.

Despite suffering from several different injuries during his 10-year spell in the Premier League, Van Persie has managed more than 250 appearances since signing for Arsenal from Feyenoord in 2004 and has scored nearly 140 goals.

Holland boss Louis van Gaal, who will take over at Old Trafford after the World Cup, will be hoping Van Persie remains fit enough to fire Oranje and the Red Devils to success over the next year.
