British drugs giant GlaxoSmithKline is to face a criminal investigation by the Serious Fraud Office, it emerged last night.

The SFO said it was probing Glaxo’s ‘commercial practices’, understood to be a reference to allegations of bribery in China and several other countries.

The pharmaceuticals firm, one of only two British drugs giants alongside AstraZeneca, became embroiled in a scandal last year when Chinese officials accused it of operating a vast bribery network.

The Serious Fraud Office said it was probing Glaxo's 'commercial practices', understood to be a reference to allegations of bribery in China and several other countries

Investigators said the company used hundreds of middlemen to bribe doctors with money and even sexual favours provided by prostitutes, in order to sway them into buying its drugs.

The SFO was known to be scrutinising Glaxo but announced its decision to launch a formal criminal investigation late last night.

While the allegations relate to GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) staff on foreign soil, the SFO has jurisdiction over any alleged bribery offence carried out by a British firm, regardless of whether it takes place overseas.

The probe comes after former company executive Mark Reilly was accused of bribery in China

‘GSK is committed to operating its 
business to the highest ethical standards and will continue to cooperate
 fully with the SFO,’ the company said.

Glaxo executive Mark Reilly, who ran its Chinese business, was charged earlier this month with bribery, an offence that carries a maximum tariff of life in prison in the ‘People’s Republic’.

Mr Reilly initially left the country as the allegations emerged, but later returned to be grilled by investigators.

The pharmaceuticals giant has previously admitted that some of its Chinese executives, two of whom were charged alongside Reilly, appeared to have broken the law, calling the allegations ‘shameful’.

‘We take the allegations that have been raised very seriously,’ Glaxo said at the time.

‘They are deeply concerning to us and contrary to the values of GSK.’

The allegations came to light at an inconvenient moment for Prime Minister David Cameron, who last year used a visit to China to lobby on Glaxo’s behalf.

Glaxo later revealed that it was investigating claims that staff were involved in bribery in Poland, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon.

The huge company is behind a large range of products found in pharmacies around the world, including Beechams Cold and Flu remedies, Panadol painkillers, Aquafresh toothpaste and Horlicks malted milk drink.

Dr Mick Cooper, an analyst for investment research firm Edison, told City AM: 'This looks more serious than what has happened in China, this is the first time the SFO has investigated a major pharma company in the UK.'
