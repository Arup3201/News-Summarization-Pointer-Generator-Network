While pre-season is usually reserved for honing player's fitness and drilling in new tactics, Stoke City players also made time for some team bonding of the wet and wild variety.

Enthusiasm wasn't dampened when the Potters swapped the training ground for a 7km white water rafting day out during their pre-season tour of south Germany.

Players including Peter Crouch, Wilson Palacios and new signing Mame Biram Diouf looked in high spirits as they donned protective clothing for the rocky ride down the rapids.
