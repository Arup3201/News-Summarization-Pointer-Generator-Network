Luke McCormick, 30, who was jailed in 2008 for killing two brothers while twice over the legal drink-drive limit, has been made captain at Plymouth Argyle

A disgraced goalkeeper who killed two brothers while twice over the legal drink-drive limit has been appointed as the new captain of his football club.

Plymouth Argyle is facing criticism after making Luke McCormick the club skipper, one year after he returned to the League Two side following a spell in prison for the fatal crash.

The 30-year-old was jailed for seven years and four months in 2008 after killing Aaron Peak, ten, and his brother Ben, eight, both from Partington, Greater Manchester, on the M6 motorway near Keele.

The goalkeeper, who was driving at 97mph, had downed beer and Sambuca shots at a former team-mate's wedding before driving his car.

He was jailed after pleading guilty to causing death by dangerous driving, as well as charge of drink-driving.

But now officials at the club have given the goalkeeper a second chance, by offering him the prestigious captaincy of the club.

The goalkeeper has been publicly backed by the club and its manager, despite fans taking to Twitter to vent their anger.

Former teammate Guy Branston said: 'I think Luke McCormick will be a 
fantastic club captain, and shouldn’t be disregarded just because of a 
mistake he made in his past.

'Take
 away what he did - and served time for - and bring it back to the here 
and now, and he deserves the accolade of being club captain.

'I spoke to Luke in detail about what happened and about being in prison, and I think he is an asset to the football club.

'I
 obviously don’t agree with what he did as drinking and driving is 
disgusting, but he has served his time and is trying to move on with his
 life.'

McCormick, who was released from prison in 2012, played for Plymouth Argyle for eight years before his contract was terminated due to the crash.

He returned to the club this summer, saying he had 'a point to prove' in the wake of the incident.

He said: 'I’m hungrier than I’ve ever been. I feel like I have got a point to prove, which I didn’t necessarily have as much last time I was here.

'I owe this club for giving me the chance and I’ve got a lot to repay the fans for, and I’m determined to make this a success.'

But although have backed McCormick, some fans criticised the move on social networking sites.

Jamie Hawkins commented: 'Plymouth Argyle remaining classy as ever' and Jamie Chown said: 'Luke McCormick backed as Plymouth Argyle club captain... JOKE!!!!!!".

The crash, which took place on the M6 near Keele services, killed Aaron Peak, 10, pictured left and his brother Ben, 8, second from right. Their father Philip, now 43, also pictured with the boys' mother Amanda, was injured in the incident

killing two kids. ******* disgraceful.'

The
 fatal incident took place in June 2008 when McCormick, who had slept 
for just two hours before driving, fell asleep at the wheel of his Range
 Rover.

His car - which was travelling at 97mph on the 70mph motorway - hit the Peak family's Toyota and killed the two boys.

Their father Philip, now 43, who was taking his family to Silverstone when the crash took place, suffered 'horrific' injuries.

After the player was jailed, mother Amanda Peak said: 'Our sons will never experience the things Luke has had.

'Phil will carry the scars of the incident for life. We will both carry the emotional scars forever.'
