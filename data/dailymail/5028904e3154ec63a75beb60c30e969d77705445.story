The principal and vice principal of the Connecticut school at the center of a teacher-student sex scandal will not be returning to their positions for failing to report the relationship.

Former Stamford High School Principal Donna Valentine says she discovered 32-year-old English teacher Danielle Watkins was sleeping with one of her 18-year-old students at the end of the last school year, but did not comply with her legal obligation to report the relationship within 12 hours.

In fact, neither she nor assistant principal Roth Nordin, who also allegedly became aware of the relationship, ever reported the incident to  police or child services. 

Watkins was arrested over the summer when her victim went to the police. Earlier this month, the married mother pleaded guilty to charges of second-degree sexual assault and risk of injury to a minor, sending her behind bars for the next four years.

On Monday, schools Superintendent Winifred Hamilton (pictured) says both Valentine and Nordin will be transferred to work at another school

At a press conference on Monday, schools Superintendent Winifred Hamilton announced that neither Valentine, 62, or Nordin, 59, would be returning to Stamford High School for their role in concealing the affair. 

Both have been on paid leave since their arrest in October, when it was revealed that they knew about Watkin's relationship with the student, who was just 17 when he started having sex with his teacher.

Allegedly one of the boy's guardians came into the school last February to tell administrators she thought it was inappropriate Watkins had been picking the student up in her car often.

And administrators allegedly knew that Watkins threatened to give the boy a failing grade, when he tried to break off the relationship. 

They two administrators were accepted into the state's Accelerated Rehabilitation program which will see their charges dismissed if completed.

But neither will lose their jobs, thanks to their teachers union. Instead they will be transferred to other positions within the district. 

'Under the collective-bargaining agreement, as Superintendent, I have the right to involuntarily transfer administrators,' Hamilton said, not confirming where either administrator will be placed. 

A third administrator at the school, assistant principal Angela Thomas-Graves, was also placed on administrative leave recently for possibly knowing about the relationship as well. 

The city has hired a retired judge to oversee an internal investigation into the school 's handling of the sex scandal, which is expected to be completed in February. 

However, an investigation may not be enough to comfort parents in the district. 

'It's going to take a long time for parents to trust the school again because it's just unbelievable what happened,' Stamford High School parent Bin Li told WFSB. 

Meanwhile, Watkins will be officially sentenced on January 22 for her crimes, and the school district is now putting her on unpaid leave and working to get her teacher's license revoked with the Commissioner of Education. 

According to the terms of her plea deal, Watkins will be placed on the state's  Sex Offender Registry for 10 years. 

Watkins, who is married with two young children, also allegedly bought marijuana for the student and a 15-year-old friend - whom she also taught - and let him drive her car while knowing he did not have a license.

Her two students smoked the drug during school hours, sometimes on school grounds, the older boy told police.

On June 26, three days after telling the counselor about the affair, he went to Stamford Police to make a statement about the relationship. The 15-year-old boy also gave a statement to police.

On June 27, police officers pulled over Watkins' car and inside they found marijuana and a cell phone, which contained evidence she had sent naked photos of herself to the boy.

Lt. Diedrich Hohn, in charge of the case, told MailOnline that she was 'hostile' and 'verbally combative' during the search.

As cops pulled her over, she had tried to hide her cellphone under the passenger seat, he said.

Watkins allegedly exchanged more than 2,000 text messages and hundreds of phone calls with the teenager.  

Address records show Watkins, lives with a man, Jermaine, whom she is believed to be married to. Facebook images suggest they have two children together.

She was also arrested earlier this year in her home town of Norwalk after prescription pills were found in her car after a minor accident. Neighbors say the married mother-of-two then went into rehab.
