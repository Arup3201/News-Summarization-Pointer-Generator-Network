Perched upright on a rock, this grizzly bear looks like any mother putting her feet up after a long day.

The four-year-old had spent the morning fishing for salmon in the river before giving herself a well-deserved break.

The bear spent a few minutes finding a comfortable place on the rock before enjoying some quiet time.

I'm just resting my eyes: The four-year-old is so exhausted that she rests her head on a rock in the river

She was caught on camera by Russian photographer Sergey Gorshkov, who watched as the bear tired herself out looking for food.

The bear was pictured resting her head on a rock while she waded through the water.

The grizzly then climbed on a boulder and fidgeted as she tried to get her whole body out of the water.

After settling down, she closed her eyes and relaxed.

Mr Gorshkov said she was so calm he was able to get closer to her than he normally can with the wild animals at the Kronotskiy Reserve, Kamchatka, in Russia.

He said: 'I loved being out in the forest on my own, watching the bear catch salmon to eat.

'I was standing very near the bear but she was calm, because she had acclimatised to my presence and was not afraid of me.

'She was a very good and active model - I wish they were all like that.

'I was in the area to watch bears so became accustomed to seeing moments like this, but I'm always happy to be in the right situation to capture them.

'This behaviour was repeated for many days, then another bigger bear moved into the area and this younger one left.'
