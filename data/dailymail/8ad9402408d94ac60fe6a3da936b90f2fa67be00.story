Just a 20 minute drive along the coast from the centre of Marbella lies the Kempinski Hotel Bahia - a five-star resort with all the class and style of the popular holiday city but, thankfully, without the gaudy reality TV stars swanning around like they own the place.

Whether I was just fortunate enough to avoid the cast of The Only Way Is Essex during my visit to Hotel Bahia or whether they always opt for a more convenient location for the nightlife I can't be certain, but I suspect it's the latter.

This particular property - one of more than 80 owned by Kempinski throughout Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Africa - doesn't need to be right in the thick of things. In fact, that's the beauty of it.

During my stay I felt no desire to wander outside of the hotel grounds, which handily include their own section of beach. My feet could be on the sand within two minutes of closing my room door. Not bad, eh?

The hotel is designed to provide guests with everything they need for the entirety of their stay - a choice of restaurants and bars, three outdoor pools and an indoor one, spa treatments and a sauna, a gym, tennis courts and water sports on the aforementioned beach.

The only time I ventured away from the 147-room complex was to play two of the Costa del Sol's most popular golf courses - Finca Cortesin and La Reserva - which are just a couple of around 50 in the surrounding area. But more about that later.

If you do fancy exploring southern Spain then the beautiful village of Estepona is less than two miles away. Day trips to Malaga, Seville, Granada and Cordoba are also an attractive option for those wanting to use the hotel as a base, rather than just a retreat.

From the moment you walk through the large revolving doors and into the vast reception area it's clear that Kempinski pride themselves on quality. From the decoration of the hotel to the softness of the robe hanging on the back of each bathroom door, the service offered by each smiling member of staff to the taste of the fresh fish served in the beachside seafood restaurant. No wonder the vast majority of guest reviews found elsewhere online are overwhelmingly positive.

I witnessed people of all ages enjoying the luxurious surroundings during my trip in mid-September - families with toddlers in tow, couples both young and old and groups of friends, some of which were using the hotel as their HQ to test out the plentiful fairways and greens of southern Spain.

The hotel is 75km from Malaga airport, or more importantly about an hour's drive. Its location adds something extra to the plush grounds and top-of-the-range facilities - beautiful views of the Rock of Gibraltar and, if it's clear enough, the northern coast of Africa. 

The hotel's Arabic-Andalusian design distinguishes it from other coastal hotels in the area, while its lush subtropical gardens cover an extensive area of 45,000 square metres.

With 132 spacious rooms and 15 luxury suites, all of which enjoy either a terrace or balcony with views of the garden and the sea, the hotel never  seems too busy even when at full capacity.

During my two-night stay I was able to sample food from two of the hotel's restaurants and drinks at both of its bars, including their signature The Golfer cocktail - a refreshing mix of vodka, melon and lemon sorbet.

There are plenty of sun loungers and beds surrounding the pools for guests to put their feet up and relax

The culinary highlight was a delicious sea bass fillet, which followed a delightful mini curried chicken burger, scallops and three different varieties of tomato with the region's famous Jamon Iberico de Castano - chestnut-fed ham to you and me.

That tremendous meal arrived after a day spent at La Reserva, one of the most visually-stunning and challenging golf courses on the Costa del Sol.

Although my performance left much to be desired, the course was on par with the popular Finca Cortesin I'd played the day before.

Both showed off the local landscape, with lush fairways, devilish rough and water features aplenty providing a difficult test for golfers of all abilities. 

While I left realising lessons are a must in 2015, both courses provided me with the most enjoyable golfing experience of my life.

Finca Cortesin is one of the Costa del Sol's most well known and popular golf courses

The first hole at Finca Cortesin is a tricky par four with a hilly fairway and bunkers surrounding the green

A large lake on hole three is sure to have golfers aiming right to avoid going into the water

Every now and then I'd hit a Rory McIlroy-style shot and admire it landing on the perfectly manicured putting surface or flying straight down the greener-than-green fairway. It sure beat a rainy afternoon at my local pay-and-play.

La Reserva and Finca Cortesin are just two of more than 20 courses to offer special packages and prices for guests of Kempinski Hotel Bahia, adding another incentive for those wanting to test out their skills in Spain.

But whether it's golf or simply a relaxing break you're after, Kempinski Hotel Bahia has the facilities, staff and quality of service to ensure you return home and immediately want to go back. I know I will. 

La Reserva is another popular track in the Costa del Sol and it's only 20 minutes from Hotel Bahia
