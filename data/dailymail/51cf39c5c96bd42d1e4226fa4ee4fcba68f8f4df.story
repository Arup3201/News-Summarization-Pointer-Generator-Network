A mother who claimed her three-year-old daughter was killed in a hit and run incident outside their Florida home has been charged with murder.

Maryann Schwartz told police her child, Yeliani, had been run over in the parking lot outside their apartment, but a medical examiner said the girl had died from blunt trauma.

Yeliani was also described as being malnourished and both she and her two-year-old brother, who is now in protective custody, were covered in bruises.

Schwartz had been arrested on Wednesday over child abuse charges relating to her son, but the first-degree murder charge in connection with Yeliani's death was added late last night.

The 22-year-old had told police she didn't see her daughter get run over, but claimed that Yeliani had been hit by a vehicle at about 9.30pm on Friday.

She called 911 while on her way to the hospital, and was told to pull over and wait for emergency responders.

When her daughter was examined at hospital however, doctors said her body was too cold to have fitted with the mother's time frame of events.

Highway patrol officers became suspicious of her story, and detectives brought in to work on the case said Yeliani had died in 'suspicious circumstances', according to an incident report seen by the Orlando Sentinel.

A report by a medical examiner found the child had died from blunt-force trauma, but it was unable to confirm if the injuries came from being hit by a car.

Schwartz's son was put into protective custody, and three children belonging to her housemate, Vanessa Morales, were put in the care of a relative after police searched the apartment the women shared.

'There were bruises on the children that concerned us and led us to think there was possible physical abuse that occurred,' Kristin Gray, of the Department for Children and Families, said.

Hospital staff had contacted the sheriff's department to say Schwartz's son had 'multiple bruises on his body that were not consistent with normal child activities', Local 6 reported.

Morales, who is currently allowed only supervised visits with her children, was arrested on Wednesday for unrelated charges after allegedly driving on a suspended license.
