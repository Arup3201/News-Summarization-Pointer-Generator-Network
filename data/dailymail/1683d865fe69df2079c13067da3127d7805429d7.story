Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie have taken to the party atmosphere of Memphis as the were seen drinking in the streets Thursday night.

The Princesses of York are in America ahead of their friends Guy Pelly and Lizzy Wilson's wedding on Saturday, along with their cousins, Princes William and Harry.

The two men opted to go straight back to the mansions where they are staying after a dinner held for the wedding guests at Rendezvous barbeque restaurant, but the same was not true for the young women.

Party weekend: Princess Beatrice is seen sharing a moment with bride-to-be Lizzy Wilson Thursday and both women are holding cups presumably filled with alcoholic beverages

Big weekend: The Royals are among an estimated 175 guests at who are visiting the Southern city for the Pelly-Wilson wedding, as Lizzy Wilson's family is from the city

Night out: Beatrice appears to have opted for a cocktail while her boyfriend Dave Clark (not in this picture) was seen later holding the oversized beer at the counter

Big night: Princess Eugenie (right) followed her sister's lead and opted for a darker hue in her clothing choice on Thursday night when the wedding weekend festivities kicked off with a barbeque dinner

Getting to know one another: Eugenie seemed relaxed after arriving earlier that day following a transatlantic flight to get to Tennessee

Making a point: Eugenie was seen chatting with her sister's longtime boyfriend, Dave Clark

Both Beatrice and Eugenie were seen holding plastic cups that said 'Kiss Me I'm Irish' on the side as they walked through the streets with the soon-to-be bride and groom.

Beatrice was seen with her longtime boyfriend Dave Clark at her side throughout the stroll. Earlier this week, the pair- who have been dating for eight years- were seen grabbing a romantic dinner together in London.

In keeping with American portion sizes, Clark was seen holding an super-sized plastic cup of what appeared to be beer as he went for a stroll alongside Beatrice. 

Beatrice wore a black skirt and sweater along with black tights and embellished flats that had pointy silver studs.

The outfit looked significantly warmer 
than that of the bride, Holiday Inn heiress Lizzy Wilson, who had bare 
legs under her nude above-the-knee skirt with horizontal cut outs and a 
lacy white top.

Eugenie 
followed her older sister's lead and opted for winter colors, choosing 
to wear black skinny jeans and an untucked patterned blouse underneath a
 cropped leather jacket.

The group were seen taking a jaunt around the historic party city after dinner at a local barbeque restaurant, Rendezvous.

Sending a message: Beatrice, who is sixth in line to the British throne, was seen holding a cup that says 'Kiss Me I'm Irish'

Whip your hair: A sleuth on Twitter said that a friend saw Beatrice on a plane with a large hat box in tow

Local interaction: Though her cousins will be cordoned off under tight security, Princess Beatrice is able to interact with local residents and workers like this bartender

Keeping up: Beatrice and her boyfriend were sure to watch where the rest of the group went after they paused for a refill

Making their way: The group gathered at the King's Palace Cafe following the barbeque dinner

Girl talk: The Royals are very close with Guy Pelly, a British nightclub owner, and have gotten to know his fiancee through their years of dating

Rendezvous is a famed barbeque 
restaurant that originally opened in 1948 and is focused on their 
specialty ribs cooked with a special coal chute.

'Presidents
 and potentates, the King and the Killer, Rolling Stones, *NSYNC, and 
everybody who’s anybody have all been down for a bite,' the restaurant's
 website brags.

The owner of the famed restaurant revealed that the group had a traditional Southern meal with some signature Southern drinks.

'Rendezvous
 barbecue, cheese and sausage appetizers, ribs, shoulder, brisket and 
chicken. They seemed to enjoy it. They had beer and wine. Seems to be a 
lot of the British like Jack Daniel's!' owner John Vergos told USA Today.

When asked if the Princes drank excessively, Mr Vergos remained tight-lipped.

'No, they were very good, but a lot of the entourage from London (drank),' he said.

Though 
the Princes ducked out after dinner and returned to the mansions where 
they are staying for the weekend, the rest of the wedding group was in a
 festive mood and they headed to one of the busiest areas of downtown 
Memphis.

Beale Street is home to a number of live music bars where jazz, R&B and the Delta blues rage late into the night.

Sister sister: Beatrice is seen smiling at her sister (Eugenie's back is to the camera, seen wearing an untucked shirt) as the group gathered before heading to their next stop

Next? Beatrice, 25, and Dave, 31, have been dating for eight years though there have been no signs of an engagement

Pack of friends: Eugenie was seen mingling with the other wedding party guests

American media has gone crazy for the 
royal Princes after Harry showed up in Miami ahead of the weekend 
wedding of his close friend Guy Pelly.

Local
 newscasts in Memphis used their traffic helicopters to track the 
Prince's motorcade as it drove into town Thursday night, treating it as 
if their native son, Elvis, had risen from the dead.

Hundreds
 of people lined up on the sidewalks hoping for a glimpse of the 
newly-single Prince Harry and his older brother Prince William as they 
dined at Rendezvous.

Stations are handling the visit in a 
multi-pronged effort, dispatching reporters to the private airport where
 Harry landed, to the street outside the restaurant where the wedding 
party dined on Thursday, and then further downtown to talk to crowds who
 have gathered at the storied city's famous attractions, hoping to spot 
the royals if the decide to go sightseeing.

Spies
 on Twitter are reporting that it appears as if Graceland, the famed 
home-turned-museum that once belonged to Elvis Presley, is preparing for
 a VIP visit so it could be that the group will be touring the grounds 
in a private event today.

Festive: Wilson, center, was undoubtedly more formal than her fiance, Guy Pelly (to her left) and the unidentified guest to her right

A moment among the madness: The bride and groom to be shared a quick second on their own apart from the rest of the group
