Two teenage boys have been jailed for beating a man into a coma because they 'didn’t value his life'.

Kane Price, 15, and Ashley Farrow, 17, used a wooden chair leg to beat their victim before leaving him for dead.

Homeless Vladimirs Kazlausks, 54, was sleeping in a shopping centre underpass in Newport, South Wales, when the two boys launched their brutal attack - which left him close to death and blind in one eye.

The attack mirrored a disturbing scene from cult movie A Clockwork Orange, which was banned for 27 years.

Price and Farrow tried to put the blame on each other for the vicious attack on May 8.

But they were both found unanimously guilty of grievous bodily harm by a jury in November.

Price, a schoolboy at the time of the attack, was sent to a young offenders institute for seven-and-a-half years.

Farrow, who is now 18, was sent to a young offenders institute for six years.

Cardiff Crown Court heard how Mr Kazlausks was discovered unconscious and 'soaked' in his own blood.

He was in a coma for a week, but miraculously survived despite suffering multiple fractures to his face and eye sockets.

The
 two boys were spotted on CCTV at the time of the attack and their 
tracksuit trousers and shoes were found to be spattered with blood.

The court heard the pair, both from Newport, South Wales, fled after the senseless attack and later met with up with friends.

Prosecutor Michael Jones said: 'It was a brutal and gratuitous attack by two young boys on a vulnerable homeless man.

'With repeated use of a wooden chair leg they tried to kill him and left him for dead. They didn’t value his life.'Farrow told one friend they had done something big.

'Price then said: “I have killed someone - it was mental”. He said he had attacked a man in the head with some wood and that after that he stopped making noises.

'He said it was a crackhead asleep on the floor. They were boasting about what they had done.'

Judge Robert Jay took the unusual step
 of naming and shaming Price and Farrow because of the ferocity of their
 late-night attack at Cardiff Crown Court today.

Following an application from members of
 the press, Mr Justice Jay decided to lift the Section 39 Order on 
Price - which had prevented the media from revealing his identity.

Although
 previously being granted anonymity during his trial, Farrow turned 18 
late last month - meaning reporting restrictions no longer applied to 
him.

Despite mitigation from defence 
counsels, Mr Justice Jay said he regarded both youths as 'dangerous' and
 would be 'imposing extended sentences'.

Sentencing, Judge
 Jay told the two young boys: 'You treated your victim as beneath 
contempt - both show a worrying complete lack of human empathy.

'You both know what you did that evening - although you are continuing to deny it.

'The victim was completely helpless and couldn’t have found himself in a more exposed position.

'You both regarded him as easy game but the law treats everyone as being equally deserving of respect and dignity.

'What happened is a wooden implement was picked up and the victim was savagely beaten around the head with it.

In the 1971 film A Clockwork Orange a young gang beat a tramp senseless for singing drunkenly in an underpass.

The film was later banned by its director Stanley Kubrick because there were fears it encouraged gratuitous copycat attacks.

After
 being released from intensive care a week after the attack Mr Kazlausks
 said he wished he was dead and felt his life was 'finished'.

'We cannot be sure how many times he was struck but it was probably not the 40 times you, Kane Price, boasted to your friends.

'The victim was left for dead, you thought he might be dead and he certainly might’ve died.'

Blood from Mr Kazlausks was found on a shoe of the eldest boy, while eyewitnesses said they saw the youngest with blood on his face and tracksuit top sleeve afterwards.

They tried to explain away those damning bits of evidence by saying they were only mere observers to what their friend had done and were too 'shocked' and 'frightened' to intervene.

However, Judge Mr Justice Jay said forensic evidence showed that the younger of the two boys - Price - was the ringleader and had been the one who hit Mr Kazlausks over the head with a wooden table leg.

He added: 'I am also satisfied that that this attack was not a spur of the moment (decision).

'Ashley Farrow, although your involvement was lesser, everything points to this being committed to this enterprise. Kane Price..... you lied to the jury on a truly epic scale.'

The court ruled that both teenagers will
 only be eligible for parole after two-thirds of their detention had 
passed. And in order for them to be released on licence, the pair would 
have to prove they were no longer a danger to the public.
