A Jamaican man faces life behind bars for allegedly prostituting women to work as sex slaves, including his 18-year-old wife, in Queensland.

Damion St Patrick Baston, 37, will face trial in South Florida next month after a joint federal investigation between Australian and US police led to his arrest in New York last December.

He is accused of running a global prostitution racket, which began when he met a Lithuanian woman who he allegedly abused, raped and put to work as a sex slave in NSW before setting up on the Gold Coast.

On trial: Jamaican man Damion St Patrick Baston will face a US court for the alleged role he played in courting women for prostitution purposes while living on the Gold Coast

While on the Gold Coast in 2009 he began a relationship with an 18-year-old woman whom he married a year later.

Police allege she was also raped by Baston and had her life threatened before escaping.

Despite the seriousness of the allegations against the 37-year-old, his lawyer David Rowe described him as 'an affable character of amicable disposition' when applying for bail in a US court.

He said Baston was 'a lover not a fighter of women'.

'Perhaps Mr Baston misunderstood women's capacity for jealousy and has now found himself in an unanticipated tangle, which has landed him behind bars,' The Gold Coast Bulletin reported.

Police say the women are just a number of victims who have independently told them of Baston's sexual and physical abuse. None can be identified for legal reasons.

The 37-year-old has pleaded not guilty to charges of the illegal importation of a person for prostitution, transporting people for prostitution, use of a passport secured by false statement, identity theft and three counts of money laundering.

He will go trial in a Miami court next month.

MailOnline contacted the Australian Federal Police who could not comment on the case because but Baston is being tried in the US.

US Special agent Wendy Bashnan said US authorities appreciated the work of the AFP.'A team of Miami and international Diplomatic Security Service resources worked closely with the Australian authorities to locate and apprehend Damion Baston,' Ms Bashnan said.
