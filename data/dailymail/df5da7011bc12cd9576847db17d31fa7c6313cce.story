Those who braved the freezing temperatures and turned up excited by the prospect of a repeat of last season's thrilling FA Cup final would leave bitterly cold and bitterly disappointed.

Unlike at Wembley, last May, the magic glow was absent. And on a day of squad rotation, rare sightings, unexpected returns and cameo appearances, Arsene Wenger relied on his two workhorses to extend a proud record in this competition.

Per Mertesacker, criticised to the point of ridicule during recent defensive malfunctions, scored his first goal of the season while Alexis Sanchez celebrated his 16th with a high-energy display which makes a mockery of the idea all players are on their knees after the Christmas programme.

Ratings by MATT BARLOW at the Emirates

Wenger has won the trophy five times, he has never been beaten in the third round and an upset never really seemed on the cards.

Arsenal kept their first clean sheet in eight games to soothe the mental scars of their self-destruction on New Year's Day at Southampton, and Hull performed with an air of a team not too disappointed to crash out of a competition they almost won eight months ago.

Steve Bruce made 10 changes, a clear hint that his priorities are elsewhere as his casualty list lengthens.

Liam Rosenior and Gaston Ramirez are his latest injury concerns, there is sickness in the squad and he was keen to rest midfielders Jake Livermore and David Meyler, who had clocked nearly 50 kilometres each in three games after Christmas.

'It wasn't a case of disrespecting the FA Cup because it gave us one of the best days of our lives last year,' said Bruce but, despite his protestations, the idea that it didn't matter if they lost seemed to have slipped into the minds of his players, if only subconsciously.

The team selection confirmed what they knew already. Survival in the Barclays Premier League is the key. 'It was a fair result,' added Bruce. 'We huffed and puffed but we had no cutting edge to bring the tie alive. We didn't create any real chances, and there was not enough in the final third which is a bit disappointing.'

Wenger picked a stronger team, but then he had few options. He would have liked to have rested Sanchez, he confessed but could not afford to with Olivier Giroud banned, Danny Welbeck injured and Lukas Podolski in Italy completing his loan move to Inter Milan.

Mertesacker has started 27 of his team's last 28 Arsenal games and was one of only survivors from the team Wenger picked at Wembley in May. Santi Cazorla was the other.

Sanchez made his 28th start of the season. 'He recovers very quickly and doesn't look to have fatigue problems, according to our tests,' said Wenger, who must hope the tests are accurate. Any injury to Sanchez would be a devastating blow to Arsenal's season.

'I was tempted to rest him but Giroud was suspended and this was an important game for us,' Wenger added. 'He feels always ready and when you look at the players with that confidence you are always torn between keeping them playing and giving them a rest.

'He is always dangerous. He took the corner for the first goal and scored a goal. He was lively and penetrating. And he is interesting to watch because he has a good fighting spirit.'

Sanchez created the first chance of the game - Joel Campbell was denied by Steve Harper - and took the corner from which Mertesacker leapt above Curtis Davie to nod Arsenal into the lead. He also skipped around Harper, moments later, only for Paul McShane to summon a terrific sliding clearance.

It was McShane's first appearance in two months since a row with Bruce which deepened when the defender took it onto social media. 'He played very, very well, he's apologised and it's over,' said the Hull manager.

As Arsenal dominated, Harper saved again from Theo Walcott, who started for the first time since last season's FA Cup third round tie against Tottenham when he damaged cruciate knee ligaments and still appeared short of full power.

Arsenal limited Hull to occasional counter-attacks and threats from set-pieces and Bruce spent much of the game shaking his head and muttering under his breath. Tom Ince fired wide in the first-half and both McShane and Harry Maguire saw headers saved by David Ospina, in goal for Arsenal as Wojciech Szczesny was rested.

Hull offered more adventure after the interval but again Harper was the busier keeper, saving another low strike from Sanchez. Campbell and Walcott wasted good chances before Sanchez settled the nerves, eight minutes from time when he twisted into space on the edge of the Hull penalty box and swept a low shot inside the post.

The FA Cup holders are into the fourth round and only Sergio Aguero and Harry Kane have more goals for top-flight teams than Sanchez.

'Well, there's no sign of him being tired,' said Bruce. 'He's world class and his appetite and desire is what every player should look at.' 

Perhaps he was thinking of some of his own players when he said this.
