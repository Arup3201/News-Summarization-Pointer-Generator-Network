The editor of the Daily Mirror yesterday conceded its revelation about Sven Goran Eriksson’s affair with Ulrika Jonsson may have resulted from phone hacking.

Speaking at the Leveson Inquiry into Press standards, Richard Wallace also admitted the interception of voicemail messages ‘might well have’ taken place at the tabloid – although not to his knowledge.

He was the Mirror’s head of news when the story of Mr Eriksson’s affair with Miss Jonsson was published in 2002, and said the scoop had originated from a tip.

Asked the source of the tip, he said: ‘I don’t recall the exact nature of it, it was from within the showbusiness department,’ before adding: ‘I can’t even recall who actually put the story forward.’  When asked if it may have been a result of phone hacking, Mr Wallace responded: ‘It’s possible, yes.’

Piers Morgan, who was editor of the paper at the time it published the story of the then England football manager’s affair, flatly denied intercepting Miss Jonsson’s messages in an earlier appearance at the inquiry.

Mr Wallace, who became editor   in 2004, said he was unaware of phone hacking taking place in his two decades as a journalist with the Trinity Mirror company.

In December, Lord Justice Leveson heard evidence from a former Mirror business journalist, James Hipwell, who claimed to have witnessed repeated examples of phone hacking by reporters on the showbusiness desk during 2000, when Mr Wallace was the department’s editor.

Asked by David Barr, counsel to the inquiry, if he knew about voicemail interception at the paper, the editor replied: ‘Not to my knowledge.’

But when pressed if it may have occurred without his knowledge, Mr Wallace admitted: ‘It might well have.’

Sunday Mirror editor Tina Weaver told the hearing she was not aware of phone hacking at her newspaper, but added there was no guarantee it had not occurred.

Earlier in the inquiry, Tony Blair’s former communications director Alastair Campbell claimed a story the Daily Mirror published about Cherie Blair’s pregnancy in 1999 might have been obtained from phone hacking.

But Miss Weaver yesterday said the article had originated from public relations guru Max Clifford.

Denial: During his evidence Piers Morgan, who was editor of the Daily Mirror when the Jonsson story ran, denied intercepting her messages

Mr Campbell had admitted he had ‘no evidence’ that journalists intercepted the voicemails of either Mrs Blair or her lifestyle consultant Carole Caplin, but queried the source of a number of articles about the former prime minister’s wife. The inquiry was told that Mr Morgan was dismissed from the editorship of the Daily Mirror in 2004 after he published fake photographs of British soldiers abusing Iraqis.

Sly Bailey, the chief executive of Trinity Mirror, said he had made a catastrophic editorial error and ‘we lost a lot of readers as a result’.

‘The board lost confidence in him as editor and that is why we fired him,’ she added.

Mrs Bailey, who runs five national titles and more than 140 regional papers, said she did not launch an inquiry into phone hacking because she had seen no evidence of it.

‘I don’t think the way to run a healthy organisation is to go around conducting investigations when there is no evidence to say that our journalists have hacked phones,’ Mrs Bailey insisted.

The inquiry also heard that Mr Blair urged the Mirror to sack a journalist critical of the Government – but failed to get a response.

Mr Wallace, invited to Downing Street shortly after becoming editor, said: ‘One of the first things he asked me was when I was going to sack one of my journalists who had been a consistent critic of the government and Mr Blair in particular.’
