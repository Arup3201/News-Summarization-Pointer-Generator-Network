A lost painting by artist John Duncan Fergusson which was discovered in an attic has sold for a record £638,500. 

When it went under the hammer at Christie's Modern British and Irish Art Evening Sale in London yesterday evening, it had a guide price of £80,000. 

But it ended up selling for eight times the estimate to an anonymous bidder and a world record for the artist at auction.

John Duncan Fergusson's 'Poise', which dates back to 1916, sold for a record £638,500 at Christie's auction house in London

Fergusson painted 'Poise', of a woman posing in a blue dress, in 1916.

But it hasn't been seen publicly after it was shown in London at the artist's 1918 Connell Gallery exhibition.  

The oil painting had been hidden away before being discovered in a French attic. 

The painting previously belonged to a couple who were friends of Claude Monet before it was rediscovered in the attic in Giverny by their grandchildren.

Prior to the sale, Andre Zlattinger, senior director, Head of Modern British Art, Christie's London, described 'Poise' as a 'a really exceptional work, of huge beauty and appeal'.

Mr Zlattinger added that he expected the artwork to do 'very well at auction'. 

He said: 'The market for modern British and Irish art continues to be strong, appealing to collectors worldwide.

'We are very pleased with the result for John Duncan Fergusson's recently discovered masterpiece, 'Poise', which sparked fiercely competitive bidding, realising £638,500, a new world record for the artist at auction, far exceeding its pre-sale estimate.'

At the London auction, 25 of the 34 lots were sold, totalling £8.8 million.

A sculpture by Dame Barbara Hepworth was the top lot, selling to a private UK buyer for £1.1 million.

'The Blue Lamp' (1912) by John Duncan Fergusson

Born in Leith, Edinburgh in 1874, Fergusson was one of the leading Scottish colourists.  

He briefly training as a naval surgeon, but soon abandoned his medical career and enrolled at the Trustees Academy, an Edinburgh-based art school.

After growing frustrated with the rigid style of painting he was being taught, he began to teach himself and travelled all over the world.

In Paris, he was attracted to the 'cafe society' - a description for the young and talent who gathered in the cafes and restaurants in the city. There, he rubbed shoulders with Picasso and Matisse. 

He was considered at the forefront of modern British painting, bur his career was interrupted by the outbreak of the First World War.

As a result, he didn't see his first solo exhibition until 1923. 

In 1928, he and his partner, Margaret Morris, moved to Paris but when war loomed over Europe once again, they decided to move once again.

In 1939, the settled in Glasgow where they stayed for the remainder of their lives. A year later, he founded the New Art Club in Glasgow - and became the first president of the New Scottish group of painters.

After his death in 1961, his widow gifted the University of Stirling with 14 of his paintings and in 1992, a permanent gallery - The Fergusson Gallery - was founded to house them.
