A convicted felon is suing television host Maury Povich after claiming that watching his seven-year-old daughter 'being exploited' on his tabloid talk show  caused him to develop suicidal thoughts.

Alan Griffin, an inmate at Columbia Correctional Institution in Lake City, Florida, was watching 'Maury' (or 'The Maury Povich Show') on a prison television when his only child, Lanique, came on-screen.

During her appearance, Lanique - who was broadcast in the December 2010 episode alongside Griffin's ex-wife, Sherilitra Nash - spoke about her father and his status as an attempted murderer.

The youngster's 'exploitation' reportedly caused Griffin such 'great emotional shock, grief and shame' that he developed suicidal thoughts and was placed in a 72-hour mental health hold.

The felon - who has been in prison since 2002 for sexual battery, as well as second-degree attempted murder - was also forced to undertake a year of psychiatric counseling,TMZ reported. 

Now, Griffin is suing 75-year-old Povich, his production company and NBC for $100,000 each, claiming that he never gave his consent to have his daughter appear on the long-running show.

'Seeing my seven-year-old daughter on this broadcast was a great emotional shock, grief, shame, and embarrassment because the topic of the program was myself,' he said in a filed handwritten lawsuit.

He added that the following day, he suffered from 'suicidal thoughts which derived from seeing his only child being exploited' by Povich. This caused him to be put under suicide watch for three days.

According to prison records, Griffin, who filed the lawsuit on December 17, 2014, has 'Lanique' tattooed on his left shoulder. Details of his crimes and sentence remain unknown

Since its first airing in 1991, 'Maury' has covered an array of issues, including teenage pregnancy, adoption, paternity test results, makeovers, obesity and domestic violence.

On March 26, 2013, the show was renewed for three years until 2018.
