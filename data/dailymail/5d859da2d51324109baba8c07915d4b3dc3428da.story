A one-hour telethon and benefit concert for victims of Hurricane Sandy is to be screened on NBC - featuring world famous artists native to the areas hardest hit by the storm.

Bruce Springsteen and Jon Bon Jovi of New Jersey and Billy Joel of Long Island are scheduled to appear in the star-studded event on Friday night, which will be broadcast by the television network and its cable stations including Bravo, CNBC, USA, MSNBC and E!

Other performers on the night will include Christina Aguilera, Sting and Jimmy Fallon.

The telecast, 'Hurricane Sandy: Coming

The concert, which will also be streamed live on the NBC.com website, is to be hosted by the Today show's Matt Lauer. It will air at 8pm EST in eastern states and be broadcast 'taped-delayed' in the west.

The telethon will be broadcast from NBC's studios in the Rockefeller Center in New York City.

Fires: Residents walk past the remains of houses in Breezy Point in Queens, New York City - where more than 100 homes were burned down as a result of the hurricane

A spokeswoman for NBC Universal told the New York Times that channels not owned by the company will also be allowed to broadcast the concert.

NBC organised a similar event after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which was followed a week later by another telethon,'Shelter From the Storm' - broadcast by the major networks and a couple of dozen cable channels.

Financial donations to the American Red Cross will help the organisation to provide shelter, food, and other forms of assistance to those affected by Hurricane Sandy.

Support: Stars have lent there support to previous disaster fund raisers. Here, Robert De Niro, left, Leonardo DiCaprio and Ellen Barkin, work the phones during the 'Hope for Haiti Now' earthquake relief event in 2010
