Almost 25 years since the Iron Curtain came down, deer roaming the Czech-German border still balk at crossing areas where electric fences one lay.

A study of the animals in the Sumava national park, in the Czech Republic, has discovered that red deer are avoiding the once perilous areas where three parallel electrified fences were patrolled by armed guards - despite the creatures having no living memory of it.

Nearly 500 people died trying to cross the barrier, which isolated the communist world from the West.

A reconstruction of the electrified barbed-wire barrier stands in the nearby Sumava National Park. But the original fence was taken down in 1991 - long before the current population of deer were born

According to a seven-year study, the 
invisible border has become instilled in the population, and will be 
handed down generations.

Pavel
 Sustr, a biologist who led the project at Czech Republic's Sumava 
National Park, said: 'It was fascinating to realize for the first time 
that anything like that is possible.'

Czechoslovakia, where the communists took power in 1948, had three parallel electrified fences.

Many deer were victims of the barrier, which came down in 1991.

'The border still plays a role for them and separates the two populations.'

He said the research showed the animals stick to traditional life patterns, returning every year to the same places.

'Fawns follow mothers for the first year of their life and learn from them where to go.'

Biologists who conducted a seven-year study into the behaviour predict it will last for generations

Scientists conducting research on German territory reached similar conclusions.

Wildlife
 officials recorded the movement of some 300 Czech and German deer with 
GPS-equipped collars which sent data to computers.

'I
 don't think it's a surprising result,' said professor Ludek Bartos of 
the Czech University of Life Sciences in Prague, who was not involved in
 the research.

'These animals are really conservative.'
