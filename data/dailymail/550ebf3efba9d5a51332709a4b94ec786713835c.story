The Seattle City Council voted unanimously Monday to replace Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples' Day in the city, ABC News reports.

Many  gathered at the Seattle city hall building to hear the Council's decision.

The resolution will celebrate the culture and contributions of Seattle's Native American and Indigenous community on the second Monday in October -- the same day as the federally recognized Columbus Day, Fox News reports. 

The Native American community in Seattle views this decision as a progressive step, however, not everyone is happy about the Council's decision. 

Unanimous: The Seattle City Council voted unanimously Monday to replace Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples' Day in the city

The Associated Press reports that several Italian-Americans claim the Council's decision to celebrate Indigenous Day disregards the Italian heritage of many. 

K5 reports that the Native American protesters said, at a public meeting following the Council's decision, that they're not against all Italians, 'just this one,' referring to the Italian explorer Christopher Columbus who is said to have discovered and landed in the Americas Oct. 12, 1492. 

Columbus Day is not a legal state holiday in Washington. 

Lisa Marchese, of The Order of Sons of Italy, said that the Council's decision tells the Italian-American community that the city no longer deems Italian heritage worthy of recognition. 

Ralph Fascitelli, an Italian-American living in Seattle spoke outside of the Council's meeting, according to AP, saying that the Italian-American community in Seattle has no issue with the idea of the new holiday.

Rather the community has an issue with the fact that the holiday comes at the expense of another holiday, one which celebrates Italian heritage. 

Children: One Native American woman said that celebrating the man who is responsible for the slaughter of millions of native people 'internalizes genocide in our children'

'This is a big insult to those of us of Italian heritage. We feel disrespected,' Fascitelli said. 'America wouldn't be America without Christopher Columbus.'

During public comment at the meeting, one Italian-American man asked the question 'But why the second Monday in October?' 

Fawn Sharp, president of the Quinault Indian Nation on the Olympic Peninsula, got a round of applause at the meeting when she said 'Nobody discovered Seattle, Washington.'

'This action will allow us to bring into current present day our valuable and rich history, and it's there for future generations to learn,' Sharp continued.  

One Native American woman said that celebrating the man who is responsible for the slaughter of millions of native people 'internalizes genocide in our children.' 

Change: Minneapolis designated to replace Columbus day with Indigenous Peoples' Day, South Dakota also recognizes the community by celebrating Native American Day

'It makes them ashamed to be who they are,' the woman said outside of the meeting. 'I personally felt it myself growing up and it's just time to change it so that [our children] can be proud of themselves and not honor a man that murdered their family.' 

AP reports that Seattle Mayor Ed Murray is expected to sign the resolution Oct. 13. 

Council member Nick Licata, an Italian-American, said that he does not view the Council's decision as taking something away, he views it as a way to allow everyone to celebrate a new day where everyone's strength is recognized. 

Council member Bruce Harrell said the Council is 'celebrating the triumph of the indigenous people.' 

'We're going to all celebrate, because we're celebrating that spirit that we all have in common,' Harrell said at the meeting.  

Seattle isn't the only city recognizing the rich history of its Native American and Indigenous community. Earlier this year, ABC News reports, Minneapolis  replaced Columbus day with Indigenous Peoples' Day. South Dakota also recognizes the community by celebrating Native American Day.
