Most people would hate being in a dead end job, but for Chuck Lamb it’s a dream come true – because he’s a professional corpse.

Mr Lamb – aka Dead Body Guy – from Galloway, Ohio, has a special talent for lying very still and appearing to be deceased.

He used to be an IT engineer, but in 2005 decided to play dead people for a living and developed his own website to publicise his ghoulish abilities.

Dead talented: Mr Lamb has a special aptitude for appearing to have passed away

Lamb to the slaughter: Chuck used to be a computer engineer but decided in 2005 to pursue a career in the film and TV industry, playing corpses

Mr Lamb told MailOnline that anyone can play dead. Here's how:

On the site – deadbodyguy.com - he implores casting agents to call him for all their ‘dead body needs’.

He told Today.com: ‘When I started doing this, I thought, “I really do look like a dead guy.” I’m pale and I’m bald, I have bags under my eyes - you could definitely pick me out as a zombie or a dead guy anywhere.’

He added: ‘I told my wife, “I could be Dead Body Man!” Everybody needs a dead body.’

Mr Lamb told MailOnline that he's enjoyed the fame playing dead people has brought him.

He said: 'One of my favorite moments as a dead guy was being asked to attend an autograph show and realizing people actually would want my autograph.

'At the same place I also got to meet some of favorite actors - Mickey Rooney, Debbie Reynolds and so on. On set one of my favorite moments was in the movie Thankskilling. I had to wear a turkey costume and the crew put a rubber snake in it then filmed me when I found it. Needless to say, it scared the heck out of me.'

Mr Lamb has appeared on TV show The Jury and movies Horrorween, Kentucky Fried Horror and funeral home comedy Stiffs – credited simply as ‘Dead Body Guy’.

And it’s not necessarily dead-easy work.

While
 on location in Florida for The Jury, Mr Lamb was laid out on a pile of 
vicious red ants, which attacked him for ten minutes before crew members
 washed them off.

Mr Lamb lists several reasons as to why he makes a good corpse, with one of them being that he's bald, which means that any wig fits him, he explains

Law and Order: SVU casting director told Today that the ability to endure hardships is the way to get ahead in the corpse-portraying world.

He said: ‘The novelty goes quickly out the window. The hardest working men and women in show business are the dead.’

Mr Lamb lists several reasons on his website as to why he makes the perfect corpse, which includes the fact he has fair skin (‘ever see a corpse with a good tan?’), is bald (‘any wig will fit me’) and he has no hair on his back (‘no one wants to see that! Even on a dead body’).
