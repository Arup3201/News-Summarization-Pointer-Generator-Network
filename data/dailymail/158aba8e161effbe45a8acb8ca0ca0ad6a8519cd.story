Sir Bob Geldof has told the Plebgate libel trial that MP Andrew Mitchell had never patronised or derided him – even though he is a ‘pleb’ from a ‘poor Irish background’.

The rock star and charity fund-raiser said the former Tory chief whip is not the ‘preposterous pantomime patrician’ he has been made out to be.

Geldof insisted that the ‘Wodehousian superior manner’ attributed to the MP, who was educated at Rugby School and Cambridge University, was incorrect.

In a statement submitted to the High Court, he said: ‘I am used to being patronised by “my betters”. There was no such nonsense from Mr Mitchell.

‘We are an unlikely pair of friends. I came from a poor Irish, not particularly well-educated background and he does not. I am in fact “a pleb” and he is not. 

'Never once in all our time did he patronise me, talk down to me, behave in a superior manner to me, deride, insult or dismiss me or my opinions.’

The Boomtown Rats frontman admitted having ‘perhaps a justified reputation for swearing a bit’ and said that Mr Mitchell ‘was no slouch either’. 

However, he then added: ‘But not once did I ever hear him use the ridiculous and archaic expression “pleb”.’

In court: Mr Mitchell resigned as chief whip a month after the encounter with Pc Toby Rowland (above)

Geldof, who was not in court, said he had a high estimation of Mr Mitchell’s probity as a man, his honesty as a person and his abilities as a professional. 

The pair worked together when the MP was International Development Secretary and Geldof told fellow activists to ‘trust what Mitchell is saying’.

‘He has never once let us down. This is a truthful, reliable, honest man,’ he said. ‘I have not a single shred of doubt that what Andrew Mitchell says is the truth.’

Geldof’s statement was one of a number of character witnesses submitted to the court. Fellow Tory MP Kenneth Clarke described Mr Mitchell as a man of ‘impeccable character’.

‘He can be a little hot tempered, but never in malice,’ he said. ‘I have never known him to be dishonest or untruthful in any way and I would be prepared to put a very great deal of confidence in anything that he told me.’

Lord Fowler, a former minister under Margaret Thatcher, did not believe Mr Mitchell would have used a word such as ‘pleb’. 

He said: ‘It came from another age and I had never seen any hint of class feeling in any of his dealings. Quite the opposite.’

Lord Fowler said the MP could not work in the HIV/Aids field in the outstanding way he did while harbouring views about class superiority.

Mr Mitchell is suing News Group Newspapers over the allegation that, after being refused entry through a Downing Street gate on his bike, he told officers: ‘Best you learn your f****** place. You don’t run this f****** government, you’re f****** plebs.’

Mr Mitchell denies this, although he admits saying ‘I thought you guys were supposed to f****** help us’ after officers refused to open the gate in September 2012. 

News Group Newspapers argues that its article in The Sun was substantially true.

Toby Rowland, the police officer Mr Mitchell reportedly called a ‘pleb’, is suing the MP for suggesting that he made up the allegations.

Giving evidence under oath yesterday Pc Rowland insisted that Mr Mitchell did call officers ‘plebs’. 

He claimed he had no idea who Mr Mitchell was and did not know at the time what the word pleb meant.

‘It’s not a term I have used or any of my colleagues or friends use,’ he added.

But James Price QC, representing Mr Mitchell, repeatedly challenged Pc Rowland over his version of events.

He suggested that officer’s account of the altercation was full of inconsistences.

Mr Price also said that the firearms officer was wrong to issue the MP with a warning for breaching ‘Section 5 of the Public Order Act’ for swearing.

Pc Rowland defended his decision, saying: ‘What I am saying is if you use language or behaviour that causes alarm or distress then that is an offence.’

Mr Price said: ‘You are saying in this country it is a criminal offence to use the word f****** in public. The word f****** is in common use these days, isn’t it?’

The officer replied: ‘It is used regularly – but not by me – and that does not make it right.’

The case continues.
