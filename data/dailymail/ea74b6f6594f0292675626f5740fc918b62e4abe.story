With Christmas just two weeks away, some of us may be worrying how we’ll pay for all those presents. Not Noddy Holder.

Slade’s Merry Xmas Everybody has earned more than £500,000 in royalties for 2013 alone – and the total could swell by a further £300,000 by the 25th.

Slade, The Pogues and Mariah Carey earn small fortunes from their festive hits every winter, thanks to radio coverage and compilation album sales.

Now analysts have estimated the money earned by the most popular tracks by combining radio, internet and TV data with statistics on royalties from the Performing Right Society, which collects fees when music is played everywhere from Radio 1 to jukeboxes and shops.

Their findings suggest that Holder wasn’t far off when he said that owning the rights to his band’s 1973 hit was ‘like winning the lottery every December 25 for the rest of your life’.

Merry Xmas Everybody – thought by the PRS to be the most heard song in the world – is the biggest earner by far, with £512,000 raked in already this year.

Its closest rival – The Pogues’ Fairytale of New York – lags behind with £386,270. Mariah Carey is third with All I Want For Christmas Is You, the newest song in the top five, which was released in 1994.

Office party favourite Last Christmas by Wham! was fourth, followed by Cliff Richard’s Mistletoe and Wine. East 17’s Stay Another Day also makes the list, although purists would question whether it truly is a Christmas song.

The lyrics do not contain any festive references – but with the help of a snow-filled video, the track has become a mainstay of Christmas playlists since its release in late 1994.

Unfortunately for some, not everyone who sings a Christmas hit retains the rights to make a fortune – no matter how well-loved their hit turns out to be.

In 2011, Boney M singer Liz Mitchell revealed she had earned hardly anything from the band’s track Mary’s Boy Child – despite it being one of the biggest-selling singles of all time in the UK.

Miss Mitchell complained that all the profits went to her record company instead, adding: ‘If I was to spend time working out what the record company got – and those in that team of people around us – I would lose my mind.

‘Our royalty statement has been minimal and menial. Really ... We get maybe a seventh of one per cent.’
