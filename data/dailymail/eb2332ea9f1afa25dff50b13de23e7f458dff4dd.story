'Miami cannibal' victim Ronald Poppo has learned to play guitar as part of his ongoing treatment after the horrifying attack

A homeless man whose face was mostly 
chewed off in a horrific attack last year in Miami has learned to play 
guitar as he continues to receive treatment for his injuries.

As the first anniversary of the attack nears, Ronald Poppo has spoken publicly for the first time.

In a video released by hospital staff, Mr Poppo thanked all the people to have supported him through his difficult recovery.

He said: 'I thank the outpouring of people in the community and I will always be grateful for that.'

Mr Poppo spent almost a month in hospital after the attack in May last year.

He has been left blind but his doctors say he has been working with an occupational therapist to learn how to take care of himself.

He has been living in a long-term care facility since the gruesome attack.

Mr Poppo has been learning to play guitar and practices the instrument daily.

A year after the broad daylight attack, Mr Poppo is smiling again.

He recently celebrated his 66th birthday with staff at Jackson Memorial Hospital.

About 75 per cent of Mr Poppo's face was chewed off by Rudy Eugene in the shocking assault.

Miami police shot and killed Eugene after being called to the scene on the side of a highway.

Surveillance
 video from a nearby building showed Eugene stripping Poppo and beating 
him before appearing to hunch over and lie on top of him.

The police 
officer who shot Eugene to death said he growled at the officer when he 
told him to stop.

Emergency callers had reported seeing a naked man swinging from a light pole
 on Miami's MacArthur Causeway a few minutes before the attack.

It was widely speculated that Eugene was on bath salts when he launched 
the frenzied attack - however toxicology tests found only marijuana 
in his system.

The case made headlines world wide but Mr Poppo has chosen not to speak publicly until now. 

Hospital staff have revealed Mr Poppo is 'living happily and 
adjusting to his new life' at the Perdue Medical Center where he has 
learned to play guitar.

A graphic picture released at the time showed the extent of Mr Poppo's injuries.

Two-thirds of his face was covered in scabs and his nose was missing.

His grey beard was trimmed, leaving a moustache over his upper lip.

However, in the latest pictures his wounds have clearly improved.

The homeless man underwent several surgeries at Jackson Memorial 
Hospital in Florida before being transferred to a local-term care 
center.

Mr Poppo, who is originally from New York, had been living on the 
streets of Florida for the past 30 years, estranged from his family who 
thought he had committed suicide years before.

He said in the clip released today: 'Thanks
 for contributing and helping out. People in my predicament need to be 
helped out and I am sure there are people also that have the same type 
of predicament.'
