Former Everton manager Joe Royle believes Manchester United must appoint a director of football to help new manager Louis van Gaal get the club back on track.

United endured a disastrous season under David Moyes after the retirement of Sir Alex Ferguson at the end of the 2012-13 season, culminating in the Scot being sacked just 10 months into his six-year deal at Old Trafford.

Moyes and executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward consistently struggled to land their top transfer targets, with only £27.5million flop Marouane Fellaini arriving at the club last summer.

Juan Mata was signed for a club record fee in January, but Royle is adamant that the appointment of a director of football is vital step forward for United.

Royle, who is involved in a new Master's degree in Sporting Directorship at Manchester Metropolitan University, said: 'Football, and sport in general, has never 
been more exciting with a global audience transforming the financial 
infrastructure of so many businesses but to manage that growth they have
 to change and change quickly.

'Football has seen perhaps the biggest growth and one man cannot run the club in the way Sir Alex did.

'In
 1995 when I won the FA Cup with Everton against Manchester United, I 
had a total of seven back-room staff. Since then, with the explosion of 
the Premier League and sport developing into global brands, organisations
 have evolved into complex and sophisticated structures.

'Sports science, sports medicine and sports psychology have become an everyday part of an armoury in all sports. As a result there is a need to make sure these well-equipped organisations run smoothly and efficiently in high performance, high pressure environments.

'In the future sporting directors will do this by championing the vision of an organisation, ensuring its staff live and breathe a winning philosophy and create a culture of success on and off the field.'

Fresh start: New United manager Louis van Gaal will need the support of the club's owners and board

The good

Luis Suarez (£22.8million, Liverpool)

Gareth Bale (£7million, Spurs)

Luka Modric (£16.5million, Spurs)

Dimitar Berbatov (£10.9million, Spurs)

The bad

Andy Carroll (£35million, Liverpool)

David Bentley (£17million, Spurs)

Stewart Downing (£20million, Liverpool)

Roman Pavlyuchenko (£13.7million, Spurs)

One candidate to fill the gap at Old Trafford is Damien Comolli, who has Premier League experience with both Tottenham and Liverpool.

Sportsmail revealed in October last year that the Frenchman is keen on a return to England's top-flight, having been without a permanent club role since leaving Anfield in 2012.

Comolli spent seven seasons as a European scout for Arsenal between 1996 and 2003, helping to find young talent across the continent. He recommended the signing of Gael Clichy from French club Cannes prior to his departure.

After a brief period as technical director of Saint-Etienne, Comolli became director of football at Spurs in 2005 and was charged with overseeing the club's scouting and transfer policy.

He returned to France with Saint-Etienne in 2008 to become the club's sporting director, before moving to Liverpool as director of football strategy in November 2010.

Although some of Comolli's signings at both clubs were unsuccessful, the 41-year-old can take credit for Liverpool's acquisition of Luis Suarez and Tottenham bringing Gareth Bale and Luka Modric to White Hart Lane.
