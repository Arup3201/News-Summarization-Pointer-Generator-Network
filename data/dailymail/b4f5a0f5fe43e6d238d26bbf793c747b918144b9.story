Everton forward Samuel Eto'o is in Italy for a medical with Sampdoria as he looks to seal his move to the Serie A club. 

The former Chelsea and Barcelona man flew out of England on Thursday and is set to complete his transfer by the end of Friday.

Roberto Martinez initially said he wanted Eto'o to stay at Goodison Park but now seems resigned to losing the 33-year-old.

Representatives of  Italian club Sampdoria came to London in an attempt to speed up the transfer due to concerns it wouldn't be completed before the February 2 deadline.

And their efforts appear to have been rewarded after Sampdoria's president revealed the club were now merely sorting out the 'last few details'.  

'I haven't been working in football for long and can say this is a strange working environment,' Massimo Ferrero told Sky Italia. 'People say one thing and then do another.

'We went to London and then there was a turn of events because nobody can figure out who is in charge at Everton.

'But we are getting to a breakthrough. Eto'o is very eager to come and play at Sampdoria.

'We are down to the last details. What are the chances of the move being completed? Let's be cautious and say 50 per cent.'

Sampdoria are hopeful of completing a move for 33-year-old Everton and Cameroon striker Samuel Eto'o
