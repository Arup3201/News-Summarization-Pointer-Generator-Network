The Football League is increasingly becoming the breeding ground for the country’s finest young talent.

With the number of foreign players in the Premier League at record levels young, home grown professionals are often finding their best crack at reaching the top is to start in the lower divisions.

Gareth Southgate’s England Under 21 side is filled with more Football League players now than ever and with clubs such as Swindon, MK Dons and Exeter all having squads packed full of academy products it is no surprise he is looking below the top flight.

As 2015 approaches, Sportsmail takes a look at 10 young stars to watch out for in the Football League in the coming year…

Dele Alli (MK Dons, 18, midfielder)

After a starring performance in MK Dons’ 4-0 Capital One Cup victory over Manchester United in August, Alli’s name will be familiar to many of you already. 

Courted by Liverpool, the heir apparent to Steven Gerrard possesses many qualities similar to that of the former England captain. With the strength and physique to play as a holding midfielder, Alli also has an eye for a goal with eight already to his name in League One this season. 

Not 19 until April, the 6ft 2in England youth international has over 60 first-team appearances to his name.

Diego De Girolamo (Sheff Utd/York, 19, forward)

Chesterfield-born Italy youth international De Girolamo is currently enjoying a fruitful loan spell in League Two with York. 

The versatile forward has long been tipped for big things at Bramall Lane and with his temporary deal at Bootham Crescent expiring in the New Year, he’ll be hoping to force his way in to Nigel Clough’s first team as the Blades push for promotion. 

This is Sheffield United’s fourth consecutive season in the fourth tier but their academy keeps on producing. Midfielder Lou Reed, 17, is another to keep an eye out for.

Jake Forster-Caskey (Brighton, 20, midfielder)

Despite Brighton’s struggles this season, Forster-Caskey continues to shine in midfield for the Seagulls. The 20-year-old has established himself as a regular starter in Gareth Southgate’s England Under 21 side alongside fellow Championship starlet, Derby’s Will Hughes. 

At ease on the ball on capable of the odd wondergoal with his ferocious left-foot, don’t be surprised to see Forster-Caskey playing the Premier League before too long. Son of former Tottenham midfielder Darren Caskey and stepson of ex-Brighton striker Nicky Forster.

Joe Gomez (Charlton, 17, defender)

Despite his age, Gomez is already an imposing and athletic figure at 6ft 2in. A centre back by trade, the former England Under 17 captain is capable of playing across the backline and has impressed at right back in recent weeks. 

Charlton manager Bob Peeters is a big fan and it surely won’t be long before Gomez ousts either of the ageing pair of Tal Ben Haim and Andre Bikey at the heart of Addicks’ defence.

Demarai Gray (Birmingham, 18, winger)

Gray showcased his talent with a hat-trick in Birmingham’s recent 6-1 demolition of Reading at St Andrew’s. 

Lightning quick and capable of playing in a number of attacking positions, the England Under 19 international has been a key part of Birmingham’s revival since the appointment of Gary Rowett as manager. 

The second exciting winger to emerge from the Blues’ academy in recent years after England Under 21 international Nathan Redmond, now at Norwich.

Matt Grimes (Exeter, 19, midfielder)

Swansea are prepared to pay north of £1.5million for Grimes and it’s easy to see why. The free-kick specialist possesses a wand of a left foot and his grounding in League Two has added graft and physicality to a naturally attacking game. 

Over half of Paul Tisdale’s squad Exeter came through Exeter’s academy and all are rapidly improving – none more so than Grimes, who is capable of playing out wide as well as in the centre of midfield.

Alex Mowatt (Leeds, 19, midfielder)

Like Grimes and Forster-Caskey, Mowatt is another young, English, left-footed midfielder learning his trade in the Football League. Full of energy, not shy of a tackle and with a decent goalscoring record, Mowatt is the archetypal all-action midfielder. 

Mowatt is benefitting from having his former Leeds youth manager Neil Redfearn in charge of the first-team at Elland Road. He was inexplicably frozen out under Dave Hockaday at the start of the season but has now resumed on a path that could take him to the top of the English game.

Patrick Roberts (Fulham, 17, forward)

Roberts has had to make do with fleeting appearances off the bench this season despite Fulham’s struggles, but his talent is unquestionable. 

A diminutive, tricky left-footer with a low centre of gravity, Roberts is capable of playing in a number of attacking positions. He has been the star of England’s Under 17 and now Under 19 teams. 

Roberts is one of a number of talented youngsters coming through at Craven Cottage with midfielders Lasse Vigen Christensen and George Williams also seeing plenty of first-team action this season.

Louis Thompson (Norwich/Swindon, 19, midfielder)

Swindon have been one of the feel-good stories of the Football League season so far with Mark Cooper’s side sitting second in League One despite having just four players in their squad over the age of 23. 

Thompson, whose brother Nathan, 24, captains Cooper’s side, epitomises the youth and energy in the Robins’ ranks. Louis signed for Norwich in the summer and was immediately loaned back for the season. 

Expect to see him playing in the Championship next season - and possibly defender Nathan too.

Brad Walker (Hartlepool, 18, midfielder)

It has been a disastrous season so far for Hartlepool and Walker but the rangy midfielder has shown enough in his fledgling career to date to suggest he can cut it at much higher level. 

Norwich, Stoke and Celtic have all been keeping tabs on the midfielder who broke into the Pools team at 17 and has already made well over 50 first-team appearances, scoring a few screamers along the way. 

Hartlepool are six points adrift at the bottom of League Two but if new manager Ronnie Moore can get League Two’s Apprentice of the Year back to his best they can stay up.

Jed Wallace (Portsmouth, 20, midfielder)

Another midfield talent in League Two, Wallace has been a revelation since breaking in to the Pompey team in 2013. 

With 24 goals in 96 appearances, the former Farnborough youngster has a knack for popping up in the right place at the right time whether playing through the middle or out wide. 

The England Under 19 international, who scored six goals in League One as an 18-year-old, will surely play at a higher level in 2015, with or without Portsmouth.
