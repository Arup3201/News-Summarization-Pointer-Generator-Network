Britain is in talks to set up a  military base in the Arabian Gulf to deter Iran from attacking its neighbours.

The plan would see RAF jets stationed permanently in the United Arab Emirates, according to Downing Street officials.

The development emerged during a visit to the Gulf by David Cameron yesterday in which he warned of the dangers of Iran’s quest for atomic weapons.

Kick-starting his trade visit, David Cameron met His Highness Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum (right) at Za'abeel Palace in Dubai today where they had lunch together before travelling onto Abu Dhabi

The Prime Minister promised UAE leaders help from the UK in the event of Teheran launching an attack.

Later, in an interview with Abu Dhabi newspaper The National, Mr Cameron said sanctions against Iran needed to be given time to work.

But he added: ‘If, in the long term, Iran makes the wrong choice, nothing is off the table. A nuclear-armed Iran  is a threat to the world and the United Kingdom and I will work unwaveringly to prevent that from happening.’

David Cameron held a Q&A session with 350 students at Zayed University in Abu Dhabi at the start of his three-day tour of the Gulf and Middle East

The Prime Minister, who hopes to secure lucrative arms deals during the trade visit, was asked about the threat posed by Iran developing nuclear weapons

He is seeking to persuade Gulf states to buy 100 Eurofighter Typhoon jets to boost their defences. Mr Cameron flew into al Minhad military air base in Dubai with Defence Secretary Philip Hammond to see RAF pilots show off the planes.

British commanders are eyeing al Minhad or al Dafra airbase near Abu Dhabi as a permanent ‘strategic base’ from where they could launch military action to keep open the Strait of Hormuz.

Iran has threatened to close the waterway, which is a conduit for much of the world’s oil.

The prime minister had previously warned against the threat Iran poses in the region and the urgency of preventing the country's nuclear powers

Tehran developing nuclear weapons would not only be a 'desperately bad 
development for our world' but could also 'trigger a nuclear arms race 
across the whole of the region,' Mr Cameron said.

'We should do everything we can to stop it happening.'

Prime Minister David Cameron arrived at the World Trade Centre in Dubai with His Highness Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed al Maktoum to visit a trade fair called The Big Five where British businesses are exhibiting their wares to the United Arab Emirates

The Prime Minister, accompanied by 
Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, was met at Al Minhad military airbase 
by UAE foreign minister Anwar Gargash and Major General Issa Saif 
Mohammed al Mazrouei, Deputy Chief of Staff of UAE armed forces.

They chatted to Typhoon crews at the 
base, which is used by the UK as a logistics hub for operations in 
Afghanistan and regional training, before joining some of the 70 British
personnel stationed there for breakfast.

British
exports to the UAE were up 16 per cent in the first half of the year 
and it was vital to be involved in the fastest-growing economies in the 
world to compete in the ‘global economic race’, Mr Cameron said.

‘It
is not just about trade and investment. We are also partners in defence
and security, we worked together in Libya and Afghanistan and we will 
be talking about all the key regional and global issues,’ the PM added.

Mr Cameron and the Crown Prince of 
Abu Dhabi will also attend a business event featuring more than a dozen 
British aerospace, healthcare and education firms.

The PM met RAF personnel based at the Al Minhad airbase in Dubai where British Typhoon jets of 99 Squadron are stationed

Mr Cameron joined RAF teams for breakfast before embarking on a series of trade talks hoping to secure deals for UK firms

On Wednesday, Mr Cameron will make a short visit to the Middle East before flying home for talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel at Downing Street ahead of the crunch EU budget summit.

It means he will be out of the country when he learns whether Barack Obama or Mitt Romney have won the bitterly contested US presidential race. He will also miss Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons.
