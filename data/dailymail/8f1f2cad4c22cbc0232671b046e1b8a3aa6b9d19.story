Bungling workmen accidentally recreated a famous scene from Only Fools and Horses by dropping and damaging a stately home's historic chandelier.

The council contractors had removed the expensive crystal antique worth thousands of pounds from a ceiling so they could change its bulbs.

However, while lowering it to be cleaned the workmen were understood to have dropped the chandelier, which hangs as a centre piece in the main hall of the 16th century Towneley Hall in Burnley, Lancashire.

Before and after: Workmen accidentally recreated a famous scene from Only Fools and Horses by dropping and damaging a historic chandelier at Towneley Hall in Burnley, Lancashire

Life imitating art: The incident echoed the plot of an Only Fools episode where Del and Rodney were hired to clean chandeliers - but accidentally smashed one

It crashed to the floor and several of the crystal arms were broken - meaning the chandelier had to be taken away for repairs.

The incident echoed the plot of an Only Fools episode where Del and Rodney were hired to clean priceless chandeliers in a country mansion - but accidentally smashed one. 

A spokesman from Burnley Council, which owns the hall, confirmed that the cost of repairs to the chandelier was £2,960 but it is covered by insurance.

He said that council staff were carrying out routine cleaning at Towneley Hall when the damage to four crystal arms occurred - but added that the fall had been less dramatic than Del and Rodney's accident.

'Caring for all items in the museum, whether in the collections or on loan, is fundamental.

'This was an unfortunate accident that happened as the chandelier was being lowered to be cleaned.

'It was nothing like the Only Fools and Horses episode and any comparison is totally irrelevant and paints the wrong pictures.'

Simon Goff, head of Green Spaces and Amenities at the council said: 'During a routine bulb change on the chandelier in the Great Hall at Towneley, slight damage occurred and the chandelier has been removed for repair and cleaning.

Missing: The chandelier which usually hangs in the main hall has now been removed for repairing and cleaning

Return: Simon Goff from Burnley Council said the chandelier had suffered 'slight damage' and would be returned 'as soon as possible'

'We will also take the opportunity to re-wire the chandelier and it will be returned as soon as possible.

'The care and conservation policy for the museum's collections is followed at all times whilst carrying out routine work.'

Councillor Roger Frost, who is also a member of Burnley Civic Society, said: 'It is a great pity that this has happened.

'People recognise it as an integral part of the entrance hall to Towneley. I hope something can be done to repair the chandelier. It is a really impressive piece.'

The Only Fools episode Touch Of Glass was aired in December 1982 and was the first episode from the series to top 10 million viewers.

Towneley Hall originally belonged to the prominent Catholic family of the same name. The male line of the family died out in 1878 and in 1901 one of the daughters, Lady O'Hagan, sold the house together with 62 acres (250,000 m2) of land to Burnley Corporation. 

The family departed in March 1902, leaving behind a building almost completely empty except for a couple of tables and a few pictures in the chapel. The park was opened to the public in June 1902, and in May 1903 the Great Hall and the south wing of the house were opened for a temporary art exhibition.

Today the museum houses a variety of displays, encompassing natural history, Egyptology, local history, textiles, decorative art and regional furniture, together with an art gallery which focusses on romantic Victorian and pre-Raphaelite art, with some earlier paintings.
