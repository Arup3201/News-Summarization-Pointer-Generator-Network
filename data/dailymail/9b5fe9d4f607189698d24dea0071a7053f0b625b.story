Actor Michael Jace pleaded not guilty to shooting dead his wife last month during his arraignment in a Los Angeles courtroom today.

The actor, who played a police officer on TV series The Shield, hung his head when he appeared behind glass panels wearing a yellow prison top on Wednesday around 9.30am.

Jace entered the plea through his attorneys and was told by a judge to stay away from his two children and not contact them if he is eventually released on $2 million bail.

Jace's attorney Jason Sias said that his client might seek a reduction of his bail at a future hearing.

The lawyer said Jace did not contest the protective order involving his children because he wants to do what is best for them.

'Mr Jace is just concerned about his children,' Sias said after the hearing.

The actor is scheduled to return to court on August 1 for a possible preliminary hearing involving evidence in the case.

Jace hangs his head in court on Wednesday during his arraignment on murder charges for the shooting death of his wife April at the family home

Jace did not enter a plea during his initial court appearance on a murder charge last month.

Police said Jace shot his wife April multiple times in the family's Los
 Angeles home on May 19 while their young children were present. The 
boys were unharmed and are now living with relatives.

Police have not released a motive for the murder but have said they are looking into whether financial or other 
domestic issues may have been involved.

Jace's attorneys have said the 
case is still in its early stages and their investigation is ongoing.

He is being held on $2million bail and faces up to 50 years in prison if convicted.

April Jace's family has called her death a senseless act of domestic violence.

Police said Jace called 911 to report the killing. Their two children were at home at the time but were unharmed.

Audio of Jace's call has not been released, but fire officials released a 911 call from April Jace's father earlier this month in which he says the actor told him he had shot his wife.

'My son-in-law called me, and (texted) me, and said come get the kids because he shot April, our daughter,' the caller, whose name was redacted from the audio, told a fire department dispatcher.

April Jace, 40, a financial aid counselor at Biola University, had three sons, including two boys under the age of 10 with Jace.

Michael Jace also appeared on the show Southland and had small roles in the movies Planet of the Apes, Boogie Nights and Forrest Gump.
