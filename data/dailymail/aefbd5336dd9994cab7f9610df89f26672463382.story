A pregnant woman has been accused of savagely beating her one-year-old daughter along with her boyfriend last year.

Gabriella Berry, now two, suffers seizures and wears an arm and leg brace after allegedly being assaulted by her mother April Koch and Koch's boyfriend, Joshua Garbowsky, in their Irwin, Pennsylvania apartment.

Koch and Garbowsky, both 22 and expecting their first child, allegedly told cops Gabby fell out of her crib and hit her head, fracturing her skull.

However doctors who examined her claimed she showed signs of 'physical child abuse'.

WTAE reported that Gabby was admitted to the intensive care unit of UPMC Children's Hospital in Pittsburgh on August 31.

Dr Jennifer Wolford who 
examined Gabby wrote in her report the case was 'nearly diagnostic 
of physical child abuse'.

'She
 had a head CT that showed a right parietal skull fracture. 
Additionally, there was brain edema that was consistent with a stroke,' Wolford wrote.

'Further imaging revealed a dissected carotid artery resultant MCA artery
 stroke in her brain... She developed gross left-sided weakness that 
remains at this time. Additionally, she has developed seizures.'

According to WTAE, Westmoreland County Detective Robert Weaver wrote in an affidavit of probable cause that the Westmoreland County Children's Bureau notified him of the alleged abuse in September. He then twice questioned Koch and Garbowsky.

He said they told him Gabby had fallen out of her crib around August 29.

Koch and Garbowsky, whose child is due in the coming months, are charged with aggravated assault and endangering the 
welfare of a child. Their preliminary hearing is scheduled for July 24.

Meanwhile, little Gabby is now living with her biological father, Robert Berry, who is thankful she survived the alleged abuse.

He said Gabby is taking medication for seizures, sees a therapist and must wear a brace on her left arm and left leg due to the injuries. Koch is allowed to visit her daughter, supervised, for four-and-a-half hours a week.

'I just hope she (Gabriella) gets back to normal. That's the biggest thing,' Berry told WTAE.

'(K)nowing that she's safe all the time now, it's a pretty good feeling. It's a relief.'
