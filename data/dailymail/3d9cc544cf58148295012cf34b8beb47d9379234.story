The search continues for two teenage boys who were seen running into bushland on Monday night and survived a second night in the wilderness during the wild storms that hit NSW.

An air and ground search has failed to locate the boys, 14-year-olds Deng Lual and Robert Whitfield, who were both last seen entering a reserve in Airds, southwest of Sydney at around 11.40am on Monday.

One of the missing boys contacted his mother by phone at 8.50pm that day, telling her they were lost, according to NSW Police.

Robert Whitfield, 14, has been missing since Monday. He was last seen running into bushland. That evening, phone contact was made location around seven kilometres away from the boys' last known location. The boys last message said they were lost

Police were able to track the call, completing a triangulation to narrow their search.

The call led police to a location seven kilometres away from the original entry point to a location near Keith Longhurst Reserve off Georges River Gorge at Kentlyn.

However, a large scale police search involving the local police, the Dog Unit and Polair has failed to locate the teens.

Police were forced to halt their search on Tuesday at 3pm, as Sydney’s weather conditions escalated ahead of the major storm that evening.

Crews recommenced their search on Wednesday.

Deng Lual, 14, has been missing since Monday. Police are appealing to the public for information about the boys' wellbeing and welfare

Police are appealing for information about the welfare or whereabouts of the two boys, and have released photographs to help identify the teens.

Robert Whitfield, aged 14, is described as being of Aboriginal/Torres Strait Island appearance, 150cm tall with a thin build, short brown shaved hair and brown eyes.

His friend Deng Lual, also aged 14, is described as being of African appearance with a dark complexion, 155 – 160cm tall with a thin build, short dark hair and brown eyes.

It’s is understood the boys are not local to the area, both living in Wollongong.

Deng Lual, 14, is missing, last seen running into a reserve in Sydney's south-west. The search was halted on Tuesday evening due to the extreme storm that raged throughout Tuesday night 

The police chase began when the boys were seen travelling in a black BMW in Bradbury, according to NSW Police.

The boys abandoned the car to enter a reserve off Banooke Way.

A woman, believed to be Robert Whitfield’s mother, took to Facebook to ask for help finding her son.

‘Were gonna find you today my boy I am not gonna stop till we find you ok (sic),’ she wrote.

‘Please, I’m begging you all, if ur truly my friends n family please come to Campbelltown and help me look for my son.’

‘My nephew is out there lost, cold and scared. People need to grow up, they are still kids and kids make mistakes,’ another person, believed to be the uncle of one of the boys, wrote another relative.

A wild storm on Tuesday night battered Sydney and outer Sydney regions, including the Campbelltown district where the boys were last seen.

Winds reached up to 160 km/h, which is considered to be Category 2 cyclone strength and Sydney was pounded with torrential rain and lightning.

Many regions of Sydney were affected by flash floods. The boys are thought to have last been in close proximity to Georges River Gorge.
