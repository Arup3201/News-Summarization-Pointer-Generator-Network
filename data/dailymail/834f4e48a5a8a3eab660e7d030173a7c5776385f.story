When 22-year-old Sheena Morris was found hanging from a dog leash in her Florida hotel room on New Year's Day, Bradenton Beach police ruled it a suicide.

But that's something Sheena's mother Kelly Osborn could never accept. In the five years since her daughter's death, Osborn has been relentless in championing her daughter's case - insisting that investigators take a look at evidence that could lead to charges against Sheena's then 48-year-old boyfriend Joseph Genoese.

With officials close to making a decision on whether to classify Sheena's death as a homicide, her mother's fight will be featured tonight in an hour-long episode of ABC's 20/20.

Mystery: 22-year-old Sheena Morris (above) was discovered hanging in her hotel room on New Year's Day 2009, but her mother has been fighting for the last five years to get her case reclassified as a homicide

Searching for the truth: Sheena's mother Kelly Osborn (pictured left with her daughter) has always believed that her daughter's then 48-year-old boyfriend Joseph Genoese (right) had something to do with her death

In the special, Ms Osborn explains all of the different factors that led her to believe her daughter didn't commit suicide.

Shortly before her death, Sheena renewed a magazine subscription, wrote a rent check and renewed her AAA membership for the year.

Sheena was in Bradenton Beach to spend New Year's Eve with her fiance, Genoese.

That night they went to dinner at a restaurant across the street and then returned to their room at the Bridge Walk Resort on Anna Maria Island.

Love/hate: A friend described both Sheena and Genoese as stubborn, and said they would often butt heads

Then after midnight, guests in an adjacent room called 911 after hearing a fight in the couple's suite.

'She wasn't the type of person to back down,' friend Rena Carideo said. 'He clearly wasn't the type of person to back down, so they butt heads more often than not.'

When police arrived, they passed Genoese on his way out. Sheena was in the room with her two dogs but didn't give any details about the fight.

According to the account on the family's website, Justice4sheena.com, Sheena called the police department close to her home in Hillsborough County at 2am because she wanted officers to check it over.

In a taped recording, the young woman's voice can he heard saying he was 'going to ruin her apartment because she ruined his life'. The Justice4Sheena site also has pictures she took on New Year's Day after their fight, recording her injuries.

The next day Ms Osborn got a call from Genoese who told her about the fight and how he was having a hard time reaching her. 

Some 13 hours after Sheena's 911 call, police entered the hotel room and found her hanging from one of her dog's leashes in the bathroom.

'Getting a notification like that is...physically and mentally, the worst, most horrifying event you could have in your life,' Ms Osborn said about learning of her daughter's death.

From the beginning Ms Osborn suspected that Genoese had something to do with Sheena's death because he lied to her the fist time they met. When he introduced himself, he said he was 35 when he was really 42.

Seeds of distrust: When Sheena first introduced her 42-year-old boyfriend to her mother, Genoese lied and said he was 35

Three days after Sheena's death, Ms Osborn met with Genoese alone in her garage and warned him that she would find out the truth.

'This isn't over,' she said. 'Sheena didn't commit suicide. You can make this as easy or as hard on me, and yourself, as you would like.'

Ms Osborn has kept true to that promise. Over the last five years she has put her real estate career on the back burner while focusing all of her spare time on Sheena' case - collecting police reports, 911 call transcripts, autopsy reports and crime scene photos.

How did she get there? One crime expert noted that there was sand caked on Sheena's feet at the scene, but no traces of the sand anywhere on the ground in the bathroom or just outside the bathroom

She's also studied other suicides, looking for patterns such as the presence of drugs and alcohol in the system. Sheena tested below the legal limit for alcohol.

There's one thing that really stands our to her about the picture of Sheena taken at the crime scene.

'Sheena and I, we wore the same mascara. I knew that...if you cry with this mascara on, that mascara just clumps up, your eyelashes are all clumped up and...hers were perfect.' 

Crime experts have spotted some other holes in the case. Veteran crime reporter Lee Williams pointed out that there's sand caked on Sheena's feet but no traces of sand in the shower, on the bathroom floor or on the floor outside the bathroom.

Holes in his story: Genoese claimed to return to his apartment in Tampa after the fight, but his toll pass has no record of being charged for a return trip

'Either Sheena was carried in there, postmortem and hung, or she somehow levitated into that room,' Mr Williams said.

And then there's the case of Genoese who apparently returned to his apartment in Tampa that night.

He gave investigators his toll pass but there was never any record of it being charged on the return trip - leading Ms Osborn to believe he never left.

Initially Genoese wasn't named as a person of interest because Marcos Claudio, a tenant at his apartment, had seen him returning home that night.

'I have people that saw me that night,' Genoese said. 'What would be my motive?'

'I'm being victimized because I cared for someone,' he added.

History repeating? A photo posted in June 2011 no the Justice4Sheena page shows Genoese in another hotel, with a new woman

But in April 2012 Mr Claudio revised his statement, saying he couldn't be sure when he saw Genoese coming home because he had been drinking on New Year's Eve.

Lately, Ms Osborn's hard work is finally starting to pay off.

After asking three independent forensics experts to review her daughter's case, they all agreed that it was not a suicide.

She brought those three affidavits to the medical examiner who reclassified the death as 'undetermined pending further investigation'.

Justice: Recently, Ms Osborn's hard work has paid off and she got the medical examiner to reclassify her daughter's death from suicide to 'undetermined pending further investigation'

A year ago, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement decided that the case should be reopened.

The case into Sheena' death is ongoing but a decision is expected soon from the Bradenton Beach police on whether to keep the suicide ruling, or reclassify the death as homicide and press charges against a suspect

The 20/20 story on Sheena airs tonight at 10pm.
