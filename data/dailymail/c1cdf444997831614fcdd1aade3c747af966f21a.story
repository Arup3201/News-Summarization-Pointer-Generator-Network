Councillor Louise Hughes protest took her 30 miles across North Wales

By her own admission her feet were killing her by the end.

But for Louise Hughes dragging a wheelie bin 30 miles across roads in North Wales to make a point was entirely worth it.

The councillor is so incensed at plans to force residents into waiting three weeks for their rubbish to be collected that she took to the streets in protest.

Yesterday she told bureaucrats that the majority of residents in Gwynedd, which includes the popular seaside resorts of Abersoch, Pwllheli and Barmouth, were against the proposals, as she presented a 5,000 name petition to a meeting of the full council.

‘The saying goes that you are never more than a few feet from a rat, but do we really want that to become a few inches?’ Councillor Hughes said.

‘I’ve walked about 30 miles across the county in the past few days – my feet are killing me, but it is worth it because this is a very serious issue.

‘Experts say there will be a huge increase in the rat population, their faeces and urine can produce very dangerous diseases.

‘Going to three weekly collections poses a real threat to public health.’

The plan to move from fortnightly to three weekly bin collections was rubber stamped by the Welsh Nationalist dominated cabinet, of the Plaid Cymru-run council in April.

They will be the first local authority in Wales to move to three weekly collections when it comes into operation in October.

The move follows Falkirk in Scotland last month and Bury, in Greater Manchester, which voted to do the same on Wednesday evening.

Gwynedd claims the move is in response to tough targets from the Labour-run Welsh Government, which fines councils who dump too much waste in landfill sites, and will save them around £350,000 a year.

But locals say they weren’t properly consulted and are ‘disgusted’ by the proposals, which they claim could see rotting rubbish left out on the streets for weeks on end.

Waiting three weeks between rubbish collections posed a 'real threat to public health', Councillor Hughes said

They say the move will attract rats, see 
seagulls scavenging around their homes and lead to a rise in fly 
tipping. As many as 12 binmen could also be made redundant as a result 
of the changes.

Local businessman Gwyndaf Jones, 49, was among 20 locals who turned up outside Caernarfon council chamber to add his support for councillor Hughes’ protest yesterday.

Waving a placard with the slogan ‘Syniad Sothach’ or ‘Rubbish Idea’ in Welsh, he said: ‘I’m very worried about the health risks.

‘We live close to terraced houses, with multiple occupants, and bin bags are already left out on the street for rats and seagulls to get at, that’s only going to get worse if we go to three weekly collections.

‘We’re just not getting value for money from our council tax.’

Another protestor, semi-retired nurse Mary Cartwright, 59, said: ‘We recycle, but there are some things that just have to go in the bin.

‘On a day like today (when it is hot) and our bins are full we have flies buzzing around already, so to have rotting food around for three weeks will be disgusting.’

Her husband, Jerry, 65, a retired Merchant Navy captain, added: ‘When I was a lad the binmen came around the back of my house, lifted the bins up onto their shoulders and carried them to be emptied. Now we have to lug our own bin around the front, then the binmen have a machine to pick up the bin and put it into the lorry – it’s all about health and safety isn’t it? We’re doing their job for them and then the council tax goes up. It’s madness.’

But leader of the council Dyfed Edwards denied the plans were simply about cost saving.

‘We are doing this to increase recycling,’ Councillor Edwards said.

‘Fifty per cent of the county’s population do recycle, but that means fifty per cent do not.

‘We have to change things.’

Last year Gwynedd Council narrowly avoided being fined more than £120,000 by the Cardiff administration for the amount of rubbish sent to landfill.

It has been told it must recycle at least 52 per cent of all refuse collected from homes, increasing to 58 per cent by 2016.
