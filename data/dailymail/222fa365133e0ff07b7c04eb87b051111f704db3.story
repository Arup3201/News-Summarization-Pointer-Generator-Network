A drunk British man somehow managed to escape criminal charges after he ran onto the runway area, stripped naked and started dancing in front of stunned travellers at New Delhi’s main airport.

The cheeky Brit caused the ruckus at Indira Gandhi International Airport’s Terminal 3 in the early hours on Saturday.

Despite the major security breach and indecent exposure, the man was allowed to continue his journey after he put his clothes back on and sobered up, the Hindustan Times reported.

Security breach: Authorities say the man managed to access the runway area before stripping naked

The bizarre incident unfolded at about 4:30am when the 45-year-old man arrived on a flight from London while en route to Tokyo.

He got drunk at a restaurant inside the terminal while waiting for his connecting flight.

The boozy Brit's exploits began when he broke a fire alarm box that immediately unlocked a nearby fire exit.

That allowed him to bypass security gates and run onto the restricted aircraft apron.

Police denied a report that the man attempted to get on a plane that was open for boarding, saying he was apprehended before he reached the boarding area, the Hindustan Times reported.

A senior airport official told the newspaper: ‘This is a major breach of airport security. Since the incident happened in the early hours and there were not too many passengers in the airport, major chaos was averted.’

The unruly holidaymaker was treated for injuries to his hand before he was allowed to board his flight to Japan, NDTV reported.

No case was brought against him, although authorities notified the British High Commission in New Delhi.
