A Tesco store was criticised by traders yesterday after it began selling beachwear from a 'hut' in its car park without planning permission.

The 'pop up' shop is stocked with holiday essentials including swimming trunks, bikinis, barbecues, camping gear, sun cream and buckets and spades.

But traders in Ilfracombe, Devon, say the supermarket giant is pinching their customers and killing off the summer competition with its low prices.

Fury: The car park store, which takes up 10 parking spaces, has been built without planning permission. Tesco are now applying for permission retrospectively

Shop owners in the seaside resort say the stall is 'immoral' as it does not have the necessary planning permission.

The car park store is housed in a building which resembles a tent and has taken up around 10 car parking spaces in the existing store's car park.

The store was opened without permission, but under guidelines a temporary structure can be built for up to 28 days until permission is granted.

Smaller shops in the area rely on an influx on tourists each year to stay in business.

They complained to North Devon Council
only to be told the 'pop up' shop is not technically illegal and it 
can't be forcibly shut down until the planning wrangle is decided.

Steve Pugsley, who has owned Quay Value Holiday Shop for 13 years, said: 'They are too big, I don't see there is anything you can do.

'It is bound to have an impact. For every item sold in that pop-up shop it is taking it out of the till of another shop in the town.'

Gwyn Churchill, who owns a greeting card shop in Ilfracombe High Street, said he was furious that Tesco was allowed to carry on trading without permission.

Planning permission: It will take the next few months for the council to decide whether to grant retrospective permission for the summer shop to be there

He said: 'They only applied for planning permission last week. I think it is diabolical. We have been in touch with the council.

'If I was to put something like that up in front of my shop, how long would it take the council to close it down?

'They haven't got permission, they have got a big enough store anyway. Even though it's legal, morally it can't be right.'

Another exasperated retailer, who did not want to be named, added: 'Are they going to do the same over Christmas? They should stick to food and food only.

'If it was outside our shop the council would tell us to close it down straight away.'

Anger: The temporary store in North Devon has been put up to sell beachwear to tourists

North Devon Council says it will take up to eight weeks before it considers the planning application - meaning the hut will be open for the remainder of the summer.

It submitted its planning application in June and locals have until July 26 to have their say as part of a public consultation.

North Devon Council's planning manager Mike Kelly said: 'Responsible businesses would be expected to apply for planning consent prior to opening, although it is not illegal for them to open before permission has been granted.

'As the local planning authority, North Devon Council follows government guidelines, which advise that if a planning application has been submitted, any enforcement action should normally be held back while the application is considered.'

A spokesman for Tesco said: 'We're pleased to be offering our customers summer essentials, so that they can pop in and grab some sun cream and wind breakers before heading to the beach.

'It's proving to be really popular with customers.'
