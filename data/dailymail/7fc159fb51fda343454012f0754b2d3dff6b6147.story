Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and his wife, Melinda, have donated $1 million to a Washington state campaign seeking to expand background checks on gun sales, bringing the total amount the campaign has brought in up to nearly $6 million.

The donation to the Initiative 594 campaign was given on Friday but it was not made public until Monday, when it posted on the state's Public Disclosure Commission website.

I-594 would require background checks for all gun sales and transfers in Washington state, including at gun shows and for private sales. Under the measure, exemptions would exist, including gifts within a family and antiques.

In a joint written statement issued on Monday, the couple said that they believe I-594 'will be an effective and balanced approach to improving gun safety in our state by closing existing loopholes for background checks.'

The large donation comes on the heels of fellow Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen's $500,000 donation earlier this month. Also last week, venture capitalist Nick Hanauer donated an additional $1 million, bring his total donation to the campaign to nearly $1.4 million.

Other prominent figures who have made large donations to the campaign include former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and his wife, Connie, who have given $580,000.

A rival campaign, Initiative 591, would prevent the state from adopting background-check laws that go beyond the national standard, which requires the checks for sales by licensed dealers but not for purchases from private sellers. That campaign has raised just over $1 million so far.

Following the generous donations, campaign manager Zach Silk said in a statement on Monday: 'For over a year, Washingtonians from every walk of life have been stepping up to close the loophole in our state’s background check law. 

'Today’s contributions represent yet more support for this important policy measure that will reduce crime and save lives in our state.

'Nearly 350,000 people came together to put Initiative 594 on the ballot, and almost 7,500 supporters from nearly every county in the state have contributed to help ensure its passage in November. 

'Their support, and that of prominent members of our community like Bill and Melinda Gates, Nick and Leslie Hanauer, Steve and Connie Ballmer, Paul Allen, and others, will make it possible for us to finally take action. We are grateful to everyone who is a part of this movement to reduce gun violence in Washington.'

According to the FBI crime report in 2012, there were 106 firearm murders that year in Washington state - up 34 on the previous year.
