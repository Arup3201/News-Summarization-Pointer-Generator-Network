A woman, her boyfriend and their friend who battered another woman and forced her to clean up her own blood in an hour-long ordeal have been jailed.

Paula Donaghy and boyfriend Mark Green, along with accomplice Edward Whitelock, subjected their victim to 57 separate injuries in a 'vicious, sustained and humiliating attack'.

The female victim, who has not been identified but moved in with Donaghy a week earlier, was punched up to 40 times and kicked, had a glass smashed over her head and even had Donaghy’s dog bite her arm, a court heard yesterday.

During the prolonged and merciless attack, she was dragged around the room by her hair and arms, stripped semi-naked and had a knife held to her throat.

She was also battered across the head with a pipe from a vacuum cleaner and had her jaw broken during the late-night hour-long attack in Donaghy's flat in Middlesbrough.

The victim had been set upon after a drink-fuelled row in which Donaghy falsely told the two men that the victim had been making derogatory remarks.

Her injuries included a badly-gashed head, two black and swollen eyes, a fractured jaw and broken nose, a lost a tooth, and a knife mark to her neck.

The trio, who all admitted causing grievous bodily harm with intent, were jailed for a combined 13 years and four months.

Instigator Donaghy and boyfriend Green received prison terms of four years eight months, while Whitelock was sentenced to four years.

At some point during the late-night February ordeal at Donaghy’s home the victim passed out, Anthony Moore, prosecuting, told the court.

Mr Moore said one of the drink and drug-fuelled attackers held their fingers to her neck, and told the others: 'I think she’s dead.'

In a statement to police, the victim said she recalled hearing from her groggy state, someone saying: 'Let’s finish her off and put her in the gulley.'

After she came around, a door was barricaded with two kitchen chairs and she was given a cloth and spray to clean the blood-spattered room.

Donaghy’s barrister, Duncan McReddie, said: 'She does not recognise herself in the behaviour quite properly described by the prosecution.

A judge at Teeside Crown Court told the group that they 'didnt know when to stop' during the attack in February

'She is shocked and appalled at the injuries sustained by the victim. She is equally shocked and appalled her behaviour led to those injuries.'

Ian West, for Green, 20, and 18-year-old Whitelock’s lawyer, Andrew Turton, said the pair were remorseful for their parts in the incident.

The judge, Recorder Michael Smith, told them: 'When you set about people in this way, particularly in drink, in effect, you don’t know when to stop.'
