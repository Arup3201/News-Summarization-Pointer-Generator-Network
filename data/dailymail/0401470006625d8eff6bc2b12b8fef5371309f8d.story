The family of a woman found hanging, bound and naked, from the balcony in her boyfriend's California mansion have filled a $10million wrongful death suit claiming that she was murdered.

Authorities ruled Rebecca Zahau's death July 13, 2011 a suicide. It was the second bizarre tragedy in days at the multimillion-dollar Spreckels Mansion in Conrado, California, which belonged to Zahau's boyfriend, Jonah Shacknai - the CEO of a pharmaceutical company.Â 

Just two days earlier, Shacknai's six-year-old son Max fell off a staircase in the home and was mortally inured. He died says later in the hospital. Zahau was the only adult home at the time.

Controversy: Rebecca Zahau, 32, was found bound, naked and hanging from the balcony of her boyfriend's multimillion-dollar mansion in July 2011

Police say Rebecca Zahau, seen here with boyfriend Jonah Shacknai, 54, killed herself because she was distraught over the mortal injury Shacknai's son received when he fell while she was home

Now, Zahau's sister and her mother are alleging in a lawsuit that Zahau did not kill herself - but was murdered. They are implicating Shacknai's brother, Shacknai's ex-wife and her twin sister in the death of the death, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune.

The lawsuit presents little evidence to support the claims that Adam Shacknai, Dina Shacknai, and Nina Romano are responsible for Zahau's death.

The court filing doesn't provide any specific evidence against the three, but alleges 'defendants planned and prepared to batter and murder Rebecca and did thereafter brutally, and with malice aforethought, stalk, attack, choke, bound and hang her.'

Jonah Shacknai, the billionaire founder of Arizona-based Medicis Pharmaceutical, is not named in the lawsuit. Shacknai and Zahau had been dating since 2008.

Max Shacknai, 6, was mortally injured in a fall while Zahau was home two days before she 'killed herself'

An extensive investigation by the San 
Diego County Sheriff's Office found no criminal wrongdoing in either 
death and no charges were ever filed.

The Union-Tribune could not reach the Jonah, Adam or Dina Shacknai or Nina Romano for comment.

Authorities said Zahau killed herself because she was distraught over a fatal fall that Shacknai's 6-year-old son suffered at the house two days earlier. His death was ruled accidental.

Adam Shacknai was staying in a guesthouse at his brother's historic Spreckels mansion at the time of Zahau's death, the U-T reported.

Dina Shacknai was staying in a separate vacation home a few blocks away, and Nina Romano had flown in from Sacramento to be with her sister.

Adam Shacknai told police he found Zahau hanging by a rope from a second-story balcony at the mansion, and cut her down. Her hands were bound behind her back, her feet were bound and a T-shirt was wrapped around her lower face.

The remodeled mansion was sold last month for $9 million to the owner of a private aircraft company in Utah.
