Ben Ivey has spent more than $20,000 wooing lovers he met online but every time  it ends in heartbreak when he realises he has become yet another victim of an online scammer.

The 32-year-old from Sydney has been scammed a total of three times since 2011 after meeting and interacting with women on dating websites and social media.Â 

'I was heartbroken after every one ended. I thought what the scammers were telling me was the truth. I was blinded by my love for them,' Mr Ivey told Daily Mail Australia.

Ben Ivey, 32, has been scammed more than $20,000 since 2011 by three women he has met online

He went online in search for love in January 2011 after a failed relationship when he was at the University of Western Sydney and an unsuccessful attempt to a girlfriend through his local church.

'I think the reason why I got scammed three times was because of my loneliness and I just wanted to have someone to love and I was prepared to do what I could to make the women happy,' he said.

Mr Ivey is the first to admit being duped three times is 'crazy' and has now put his parents in control of his bank accounts to ensure it doesn't happen again.

'Every time the scammer asked me for money I told them about the previous scammer and how upset I was by that. But they assured me it wouldn't happen again. I believed every time this would come true, but it didn't,' he said.

Mr Ivey, who volunteers at a Christian radio station on Sydney's north shore, was scammed for the first time in January 2011 after meeting Michele Raymond on a website called benaughty.com.

She told him she was an actress in London and said she needed money because her handbag had been stolen, she had been jailed for drug use and her plane was delayed while she was en route to see him.

After 17 days and finding himself $1,965 out of pocket, Mr Ivey realised it was a scam.

Just a few months later, Mr Ivey met Brenda Campbell via a Facebook dating group. They spoke over Facebook and she told him she lived near him at Mona Vale in Sydney's north and owned an online jewellery store.

Mr Ivey, who attended Knox Grammar School in Sydney, sent her a total of $11,433 via Western Union after hearing she had to fly interstate urgently with her dog.

He contacted police immediately after realising it was yet another scam and was forced to delete his social media accounts, cancel his ATM cards and open new bank accounts.

Despite three failed online attempts, Mr Ivey says he has finally found love and plans to propose to his girlfriend Thei when he can travel to the Philippines to meet her for the first time

In September 2012, Mr Ivey placed a dating advertisement on sydney.craiglist.com.au and was contacted by Annie - another woman living in London.

She told him she wanted to come to Sydney to marry him but had to first pay legal fees on a property she had inherited in order to own it. Mr Ivey sent across $8,024 via Western Union.

'Like all of the previous scams, I kept this one hidden from my parents and friends for the fear of rejection and hurt,' he said.

He told his parents of his misfortune in October 2012 and they have since monitored all of his spending and have access to his bank accounts.

Despite three failed online attempts, Mr Ivey says he has finally found love and plans to propose to his girlfriend when he can travel to the Philippines to meet her for the first time.

n a bid to stamp out further scams, Mr Ivey has put his parents in charge of his bank accounts and now deletes any emails Facebook friend requests from people he hasn't met in person

He believes his new partner Thei, who he met via a dating app in May last year, 'is the real thing' because he has chatted with her over a Skype - something not pursued by the other three women.

'I told her about the scams and she assured me that she wasn't a scammer herself and would never ask me for money,' he said.

'I video chatted with her on Skype and spoke with her family. This proved to me that she was the real thing. I never video chatted with any of the scammers.

'I have never met Thei in person and I am hoping to meet her when I can afford it. Once I have a plane ticket to the Philippines I will propose to Thei.'

In a bid to stamp out further scams, Mr Ivey now deletes any emails Facebook friend requests from people he hasn't met in person.

'The best piece of advice I can offer is to never trust anyone online with your bank details,' he said.
