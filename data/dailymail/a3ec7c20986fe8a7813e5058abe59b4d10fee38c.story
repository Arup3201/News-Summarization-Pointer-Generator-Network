The biggest McDonald's restaurant in the world will open for six weeks during the London 2012 Olympic games.

More than 50,000 Big Mac burgers and 180,000 portions of fries will be served from the outlet in Stratford, east London.

The huge temporary branch will have seating for 1,500 customers and will employ more than 2,000 staff.

While the world's top athletes compete at the Olympics and Paralymics from July 27 to September 9 three million people are expected to visit the McDonald's branch.

The 3,000 square-metre restaurant built from recyclable materials will stretch over two floors and is equivalent to half the length of an American football field.

The 12,000 people who applied to work at
 the huge branch and three others planned for the Olympic site have been
 put through X Factor style auditions across the country.

They were judged on politeness and how well they flipped burgers, served ice cream and cooked the French fries.

McDonald's began its involvement with the Olympics in 1968 when the company airlifted hamburgers to U.S. athletes competing in Grenoble, France.

The firm first became an official sponsor at the 1976 Olympic Games in Montreal and in 1984 McDonald's footed the bill for the Olympic swimming stadium in Los Angeles.

The London Olympics will be the ninth games where McDonald's has acted as the event's official restaurant and the only branded food retailer feeding the athletes.

Usain Bolt, the world's fastest man who won gold at the 100 metres in Beijing in 2008, claimed that chicken McNuggets were key to his success.

The Jamaican, dubbed Lightning Bolt, said: 'I woke around 11am and decided to watch some TV and had some nuggets.

'Then I slept for a couple of hours more. Then I got some more nuggets and came to the track.'

Ingredients for the McDonald's menu at London 2012 will be sourced from 17,500 British and Irish farms.

The fast-food giant also plans to give away nine million activity toys with its Happy Meals during the games as part of its 'Mascotathon' campaign.

The gadgets will measure how many steps or jumps
 the child makes in a day. They are then encouraged to join an 
online game that translates their actions into energy for Games mascots 
Wenlock and Mandeville.
