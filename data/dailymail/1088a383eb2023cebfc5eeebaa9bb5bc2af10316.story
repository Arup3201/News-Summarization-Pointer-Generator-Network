A new report claims that embattled Miami Dolphins guard Richie Incognito's bullying wasn't limited to other players, but also includes a member of the team's staff, whom Incognito allegedly mocked about his ethnic background and made crude joke's about the man's wife.

According to two sources, 'Incognito would sometimes dress in garb from the staff member’s culture and then make profane jokes about that culture.'

Another source says that another player joined Incognito in the bullying.

Bullying claims: Miami Dolphins Guard Richie Incognito, right, has been accused of bullying younger players though he denies the claims

These most recent allegations about Incognito's alleged bullying antics were first reported by National Football Post.

In addition to the cultural jabs, 
Incognito reportedly made sexual references to the staffer's wife, 
telling the man that she'd had sex with several members of the team.

According to the report, the 
harassment was done in full-view of other staffers and that team 
management and front-office staff did nothing to stop it.

The NFL currently is investigating 
the allegations against Incognito and the Dolphins, as well as the 
alleged bullying of Incognito's former teammate Jonathan Martin, who 
claims he was relentlessly harassed by Incognito to the point that he 
left the team to seek mental health treatment.

In one of the disturbing exchanges, 
Incognito referred to Martin, 24, as a ‘half-n*****’, while in another 
he threatened to defecate in his young teammate's mouth.

Incognito also made reference to tracking down members of Martin's family and harming them in other texts, reports CBS Sports.

Incognito was indefinitely suspended by the NFL earlier this month while the league investigates the situation involving the rookie Martin.

Martin left the team after an incident involving Incognito in the team cafeteria in October.

It was later alleged that almost all the veteran Dolphins players have forced newer recruits to fund their lavish lifestyles 
including $30,000 dinners.

According to reports on ESPN and in the Miami Herald, the alleged bank-rolling is part of the reason for Martin's shocking leave of absence from the team.

ESPN
 claims Incognito got Martin to contribute $15,000 to 
help finance a trip to Vegas last summer, even though he didn't attend. 
However, Incognito quickly disputed the report on Twitter.

ESPN's Chris Mortensen and Adam Schefter released a report regarding Incognito on ESPN.com, saying that several sources insisted Incognito was involved.

They said the incident was not isolated and extended to 2012, when Martin was a second-round draft pick by the team.

One source said any emotional issues Martin is experiencing are directly related to his harassment.

Reporter Adam Schefter tweeted on Monday some of Incognito's alleged messages to Martin

After the allegations were made public, Dolphins coach Joe Philbin said, 'This is something we take 
very seriously and will not be tolerated'.

Incognito has been playing with the 
Dolphins since 2010 and has been in the NFL since 2006, originally with 
the St. Louis Rams. He was selected to the Pro Bowl just last season as 
an offensive guard.

Meanwhile, the Herald reported that one unnamed young player had coughed up so much cash to veterans that he's gone broke.

Reporter
 Adam Beasley tweeted: 'Recently, a younger player was handed the tab 
for a $30,000 team dinner. The rookie minimum this year is around 
$400.000.'

Two tweets from Jared Odrick and Will Davis support the accusation.

'Everything tastes better when 
rookies pay for it,' Odrick tweeted on November 2, while Davis wrote 'I 
just seen a dinner bill for $30,000... WOW #RookieNight.'

Jeff Darlington from NFL.com reported the suspension on Twitter

'Sources': ESPN TV personality, Adam Schefter, who first broke the story, is being attacked by Incognito on Twitter who says Schefter is 'slandering' his name

The team has labeled the accusations of bullying as 'speculation.'

They added that their number one concern was Martin's health and well-being.

'The
 Miami Dolphins, including Coach Joe Philbin and Jonathan's teammates, 
have been in communication with Jonathan and his family since his 
departure from the club and continue to be in contact. Our primary 
concern for Jonathan is his overall health and well-being,' the 
statement read.

'As an
 organization, we take any accusations of player misconduct seriously. 
The notion of bullying is based on speculation and has not been 
presented to us as a concern from Jonathan or anyone else internally. 
The reports that the NFLPA is investigating our players are inaccurate.

'Additionally, the NFL offered its assistance during this time, which we 
appreciated and gladly accepted. We will continue to make Jonathan's 
health and well-being a focus as we do with all of our players.'

After ESPN 
reporters Chris Mortensen and Adam Schefer's early stories about the allegations, Incognito 
took to Twitter to rubbish the claims against him, writing 
'@AdamSchefter Stop slandering my name. You hide behind "sources" who 
are not man enough to put their name behind the BS you report.'

Three minutes later, the player 
added: '@AdamSchefter This is the second time you have tried to drag my 
name through the mud with lies.'

Martin,
 nicknamed 'Big Weirdo' by some teammates has apparently been plagued by
 bullying since joining Miami as a 2012 second-round draft choice.

Educated: The 6-foot-5, 312-pound Martin is Stanford-educated and the son of two lawyers who attended Harvard University

The 6-foot-5, 312-pound Martin is Stanford-educated and the son of two lawyers who attended Harvard University.

A 
second-round draft pick, Martin started every game at 
right tackle as a rookie last year. He switched to left tackle this 
season, then moved back to the right side last month in a reshuffling of
 the Dolphins' struggling offensive line.

'You can approach this two different ways,' Martin said regarding his latest position switch at the time.

'You
 can go in the tank and be one of those guys that moans and is a cancer 
in the locker room, or you can be a professional and play as hard as you
 can. My mindset is I'm going to go out there and do whatever I can to 
help the team win.'

Pass 
protection has been a problem for Miami all season. Ryan Tannehill went 
into the Bengals game with an NFL-high 32 sacks, and the Dolphins (3-4) 
were saddled with a four-game losing streak.
