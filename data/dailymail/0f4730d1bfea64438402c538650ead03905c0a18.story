After Arthur Renowitzky was paralyzed in a random attack in 2007, his service dog Love kept him company throughout his painful recovery.

The two have been inseparable ever since, so when Love was stolen as Renowitzky climbed out of his car on Wednesday afternoon, he immediately launched a campaign to rescue her.

The pair were reunited yesterday after a Twitter campaign lead by NCIS star Pauley Perrette, who offered a $5,000 reward to whoever brought the dog back safely.

Love has accompanied Renowitzky everywhere since he was paralyzed in 2007 in a random gun attack which shattered a vertebrae in his spine

The toy Poodle was snatched as Renowitzky went to exercise at the San Leandro Marina at around 8pm on Thursday night.

Renowitzky said he parked in the disabled bay, took his eyes off her in order to get into his wheelchair, and when he looked up she was gone.

He took to Twitter, asking followers to help bring her back, a call which was quickly taken up byÂ  Perrette -- who plays Abby Sciuto on the television series NCIS.

Perrette met Renowitzky at a children's charity event a year ago. Shortly afterwards she bought a new wheelchair for him after his was run over, and the pair have been friends ever since.

Love, a toy poodle, was brought back by by Raymond Dixon who said he bought her for $375 in a Walmart car park to replace his aunt's dog who got run over

After she offered a $5,000 reward, Oakland-resident Daymond Dixon came forward saying he had unwittingly bought the dog for $375 in a Walmart parking lot on Wednesday night.

Speaking to NBC Los Angeles, Dixon said: 'I feel relieved knowing he got his dog back.' He added that he bought the pet for his aunt after hers was run over in an accident.

Renowitzky was paralyzed from the chest down aged 20 after he was shot in the chest while leaving a club in 2007, with the bullet shattering his spinal chord.

He founded the Life Goes On foundation, which helps young people avoid violence and overcome obstacles, and now works giving speeches and attending charity events to raise awareness.
