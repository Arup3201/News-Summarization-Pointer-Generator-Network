Syrian rebel fighters desperately running  for cover amid flying debris and shrapnel, two bodies hanging from a bridge in Mexico and a terrified family hiding during the Westgate mall massacre in Nairobi have all won a place in the World Press Photo contest.

But the coveted top spot of World Press Photo of the Year was scooped by U.S. photographer John Stanmeyer who took a late night photo of African migrants on the shore of Djibouti city in February 2013.

Jury member Jillian Edelstein said about the winning image: 'It's a photo that is connected to so many other stories-it opens up discussions about technology, globalization, migration, poverty, desperation, alienation, humanity. It's a very sophisticated, powerfully nuanced image. It is so subtly done, so poetic, yet instilled with meaning, conveying issues of great gravity and concern in the world today.'

The prize-winning entries of the 
World Press Photo Contest 2014, the world's largest annual press 
photography contest, were announced earlier today.
