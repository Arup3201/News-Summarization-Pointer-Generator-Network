One in ten GPs earns more than the Prime Minister, official figures show.

Despite efforts to rein in the pay of family doctors, many still receive vastly more than David Cameron’s annual salary of £142,500.

A total of 3,430 general practitioners earned more than £150,000 in 2012/13 – 10.5 per cent of self-employed GPs – according to the figures, published yesterday by the Government’s Health and Social Care Information Centre.

Some 630 were paid more than £200,000 and 160 received in excess of £250,000.

Last night campaigners criticised the ‘telephone-number salaries’, saying they would anger patients who have difficulty getting an appointment with their GP.

The official figures also reveal a huge disparity in pay levels between male and female GPs.

Men on average were paid £109,400 – spending another £169,000 on office expenses and staff salaries. Women doctors, in contrast, received £73,800 and spent another £101,100 on expenses and salaries.

The figures actually reveal a slight decline in pay since 2011/12. Contractor GPs – those 80 per cent of family doctors who are partners in their surgery – received an average £102,000 last year, a £1,000, or 0.9 per cent, decrease on the year before.

But their pay is still vastly higher than a decade ago thanks to a controversial contract that also allowed them to stop working out of hours. 

Before the contract – brought in by Labour in 2004 – GPs earned an average of £77,000 a year.

That leaped to £110,000 after the contract was introduced, but has been gradually falling ever since as ministers try to get a grip on their pay.

The other 20 per cent of GPs are salaried. They are paid by their practices and earn much less.

The Treasury has imposed a freeze on public sector pay, but it cannot make contractor GPs – who are self-employed – pay themselves any less.

Instead the Government has put strict limits on the increase in the overall contract sum payable to surgeries – the money out of which GPs have to take their salaries.

The official pay report, which is based on HM Revenue and Customs data, shows that the average gross figure available to GPs for running their practices rose by 1.4 per cent in 2012/2013. But because the cost of rent, practice staff salaries and office expenses rose, doctors had slightly less left to pay themselves.

Doctors have complained bitterly about being forced to pay themselves less – and even suggested that the GP surgery is facing ‘threat of extinction’.

The Royal College of General Practitioners said earlier this year that some surgeries could be forced to close because of smaller budgets.

And the British Medical Association has complained that below-inflation pay rises had left doctors with a ‘deep sense of outrage’. More than half of GPs think that their pay is so bad that they are considering early retirement, according to a poll of doctors published in March.

Yet when their pay was boosted by 30 per cent a decade ago even some doctors admitted they were surprised by what they had managed to negotiate.

In 2007, Dr Simon Fradd, the BMA negotiator who won the deal, said: ‘It was just stunning really. Stunning in that no one in my position had ever believed we could pull it off.’ He had at first thought GPs’ pay would be docked by up to £50,000 if they wanted to opt out of working out of hours.

But the Labour government let them reduce their pay by only £6,000 each if they opted not to work the anti-social shifts – and gave them a huge pay increase for their other work.

Alex Wild, policy analyst at the TaxPayers’ Alliance campaign group, said: ‘Patients waiting weeks for appointments because their GP doesn’t open at weekends or out of hours will find these telephone-number salaries particularly galling.

‘GPs are highly qualified professionals and should be compensated as such, but their pay packages have exploded since the disastrous 2004 GP contract, which sees them get paid more to work less.

‘If British GPs’ pay fell in line with that of their counterparts in the likes of France and Australia, we could afford more of them and slash the time it takes to get an appointment.’

A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘General practice is the bedrock of the NHS which is why we’ve increased funding, strengthened proper family doctoring and provided millions more patients with evening and weekend appointments.’
