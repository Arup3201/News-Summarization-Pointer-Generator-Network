Hull KR are looking for two new half-backs as well as a hooker after releasing homesick Australian Kris Keating just 12 months into a three-year contract.

The Robins have sold both their co-captains over the last six weeks, with hooker Josh Hodgson moving to the NRL with Canberra Raiders and stand-off Travis Burns joining St Helens, and have now reached an agreement with Keating to enable him to return home.

The 25-year-old Keating joined the club from Canterbury Bulldogs as a replacement for outgoing skipper Michael Dobson at the start of the season, but the club say he struggled to settle in East Yorkshire for family reasons and the player was dropped by coach Chris Chester for the last two matches.

Hull KR chief executive Mike Smith said: 'Kris was unsettled and wanted to return home at the end of the season.

'He didn't figure in head coach Chris Chester's long-term plans and an agreement has therefore been reached to allow him to go back to Australia.

'I'd like to thank Kris for all his efforts with the club this year and we wish him all the best for the future.

'We have been planning for next season with this possibility in mind and the process of bringing in a replacement for Kris for 2015 and beyond has already been started. We hope to have some news on this for our supporters in the near future.'

A former Australian schoolboy international, Keating played for both Canterbury and the Parramatta Eels in the NRL before joining the Robins and has made 24 appearances for the club this season, scoring five tries.Â
