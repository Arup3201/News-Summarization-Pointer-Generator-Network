When you're trying to steal a car, there is one requirement that is needed: an ability to drive.

One would-be car thief in Omaha, Nebraska, fell at the first hurdle after breaking his way into one family's car.

He wasn't able to back the Dodge Caliber out of the driveway because he had never learned how to drive stick-shift.

Foiled: A man attempting to steal a Nebraska family car didn't get very far after finding out he couldn't drive the vehicle he was trying to make off with because it wasn't automatic

Wanted: Mganga Mganga, 17, the teenager spent almost ten minutes in the car before surrendering to police when he realized he would unable to drive away

Theo Peters who owned the car watched as the hapless driver fumbled around with the controls but was unable to make the car budge an inch.

Lights went on and off - and even the windscreen wipers began to move, but the car stayed still.

It happened early on Thursday morning as Mr Peters watched as his wife Melissa headed over towards the car, to take their teenage son to school.

'She jumped out and ran back into the house,' Mr Peters said. 'The thief was sitting in the car like he didn't care.'

'I looked out the window and she was hollering and stuff and saying he had a gun!'

'My first priority is, of course, my kid,' Melissa Peters said.

She went around to the car's passenger side where her son was sitting. 'I opened the door. He got out. We started running. I was hollering up a storm.'

For about 15 minutes, Mr Peters said he watched the teen struggle to drive off in the family car.

Watched: Theo Peters watched his wife Melissa and 13-year-old son run from the car as they realized there was an armed thief already inside

Stumped: The 17-year-old thief was unable to shift the car out of neutral and ended up being stuck in the driveway

'He looked and you could see the car lights coming on. He tried to crank the car, but it wouldn't go nowhere.'

Mr Peters called 911 for the police to come and deal with the dumb driver.

Eight minutes later, he was still sitting in the car until finall the cops arrived on the scene.

The carless crook attempted to make a run for it but was eventually caught by police.

Thursday afternoon, police identified the suspect as Mganga Mganga, 17.

Mganga has been charged with three counts of robbery and three counts of use of a deadly weapon to commit a felony in connection with incidents last year. He is out on $10,000 bail.

Caught: The would-be car thief did end up having a ride in the end... to the police station

Caught: Lt Michael McGee from Omaha Police Department says there are some benefits to driving a manual car and this is one of them

'For those of you who still have stick shift vehicles there is an advantage in today's time,' said Omaha Police Department Lt. Mike McGee. 'Young people don't know how to drive them.'

Mr Peters said he and his wife saw Mganga walking around the neighborhood on Wednesday.

His wife thought it was suspicious, but Peters said he thought the teen was just waiting for someone to pick him up. In the end it was the police that picked him up.
