Pensioners who sold their homes in hope of a dream retirement have today told an inquiry how their hopes were shattered after learning they had actually been sold part time holiday homes.

Residents of the Lakeminster Park development, near Beverley, East Yorkshire, said they were 'blissfully unaware' when they sold their old homes that they were actually moving into holiday accommodation rather than permanent residences.

A council has rejected retrospective planning permission for them to be used as full-time houses leaving them with the prospect of being evicted.

A fraud investigation is running at the same time as the planning inquiry.

Four people have been arrested as part of the alleged fraudulent selling of the homes.

More than 100 pensioners in 78 homes are affected.

They include sufferers of lung cancer, Parkinson’s disease, arthritis, diabetes, and other crippling ailments who need homes with easy access, and had given up their jobs looking forward to a mortgage-free life away from city estates.

The planning inquiry is currently under way to decide whether East Riding Council was right to refuse them retrospective planning permission.

Dave Foulstone, 61, and his wife sold their bungalow to buy their £140,000 park home on the site.

Mr Foulstone said: 'We found out to our dismay we had purchased a holiday home  - not a permanent home.

'We were in a complete state of shock. We would be devastated if we had to leave the site and do not have the money to purchase another property.'

Residents say they sold up and bought the properties as full-time homes, but were then told the park homes are only for holiday use and they must have another permanent address.

Retired civil servant Alan Coates was one of the first to move onto the park, and had been 'blissfully unaware' anything was wrong after selling his bungalow.

He is one of the guiding lights of an appeal against East Riding Council’s refusal to grant the consent for permanent homes on the site.

He and his frail wife had been living there more than two years before council bosses wrote to them to say there was a planning problem.

He told the inquiry: 'I can’t see we are doing much harm.

'We live in a nice community and pay our taxes. I can’t understand the council’s view for us to have to leave.'

Barrister Ruth Stockley, representing Mr Coates, told the first day of the inquiry that the outcome would affect every person living there.

In her opening statement, Miss Stockley said: 'The dismissal of this appeal will result in all the residents of this site losing their homes.

'They’ll be made homeless and you will hear about the difficulties they will face.'

Barrister Nicola Allan, representing East Riding Council, said: 'The establishment of a retirement park home village in the open countryside would set a precedent that would inevitably encourage breaches elsewhere.

'This is particularly the case in this council’s area, which has a substantial number of caravans in holiday use. The council maintains this is a flagrant breach of planning control and the development is contrary to the development plan.'

Those arrested as part of the fraud inquiry include a solicitor of 40 years, a 50-year-old man, a 52-year-old woman, and a 31-year-old woman from Beverley.

A 47-year-old woman was arrested in relation to money laundering allegations linked to Lakeminster.The inquiry is expected to last another fortnight.
