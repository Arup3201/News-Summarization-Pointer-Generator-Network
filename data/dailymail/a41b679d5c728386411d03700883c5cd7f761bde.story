Looking lean and healthy and sporting something of a George Clooney look, Darren Clarke signed on for his first official engagement as Europe’s Ryder Cup captain.

There are 550 days to go before Clarke takes his golfing monument men to Minnesota to try to bring back the trophy — and many of those days will be filled with the sort of media engagements that occupied his time at the Sofitel at Heathrow’s Terminal Five.

No doubt Clarke may struggle for something to say on occasion but that was not the case here as he spoke about Rory McIlroy and other pertinent matters, including one surprising comment regarding the Ryder Cup.

After the comprehensive win at Gleneagles last time in 2014, the overwhelming temptation must be to keep everything the same but Clarke is considering one small change to the blueprint.

He plans to study the data on wildcards in the tournament before deciding whether to recommend cutting their number from three to two.

Of course, there are arguments both ways. He might leave himself short of options if too many of the top players fail to qualify automatically but there is an equally compelling case for saying the man finishing in 10th spot deserves to make the team by right.

Even this far out Clarke is unequivocal, however, about who will be the team leader — it just has to be McIlroy. Clarke has known the 25-year-old Ulsterman since before McIlroy was even a teenager.

‘Rory always was special as a kid and a golfer,’ said Clarke. ‘He was different from everyone else and still is.’

The skipper is excited to see how McIlroy fares at the Masters next month but is adamant about one thing: Rory will complete the career Grand Slam one day.

‘If he doesn’t win it this year, he will win it next year,’ he said. ‘He’s just too good not to win it, with all his gifts and on a course made for his game.’

What sort of captain will Clarke be? Given his emotional personality, it is hardly surprising he picks out the Ryder Cup ships run by Ian Woos-nam and Sam Torrance.

‘Sam once said to me that playing in the Ryder Cup is like having your first child, that you really can’t describe it until you’ve gone through it, and that’s always stuck with me,’ he said. ‘I was fortunate enough to experience the pressure of contending for a major and coming through to win, but for me the pressure of the Ryder Cup was far greater.

‘And I will be a player-friendly captain. Some might think I’m too close to the players but I will not shirk my responsibilities.’

Clarke is keen to foster that community feeling that marked Paul McGinley’s team in 2014 and one or two earlier incarnations. ‘It was interesting seeing that from the outside at Gleneagles,’ he said. ‘I was working for Sky but that togetherness was still so easy to see and clearly so beneficial.’

Clarke had a well-publicised falling out with McGinley but, thankfully, both are keen to present a united public front.

‘Of course I will be taking up his offer to talk with him,’ said Clarke. ‘Paul couldn’t have done a better job so it would be foolish not to talk. I intend to speak to all the captains. How can that not be a help?’

The first day in a new job can often be a nervous one but Clarke was composed and confident, and enjoyed some light-hearted football banter. After Sir Alex Ferguson’s motivational talk at Glen- eagles, would Clarke the Liverpool fan ask keen golfer Steven Gerrard to speak in Minneapolis, given he will be playing in America by then?

‘After yesterday, what a time to ask me that!’ he said.

What price Tiger Woods pulling out of the Masters next week just as he did last year? Whatever happens, it is guaranteed already to be another sad landmark in his startling fall from grace. 

Now down to 96th in the world, Woods is certain next Monday to fall out of the top 100 for the first time since October 13, 1996.

‘I have a dislocated shoulder and it has been keeping me out of the gym, which is disappointing. I want to stay fit because . . . well, I shall be old one of these days.’

Arnold Palmer holding court as tournament host last week. Now 85, the great man promised that not even a dislocated shoulder would prevent him from hitting the ceremonial first tee shot at the Masters. In the words of the old Bob Dylan song, may he stay forever young.

There is a fine line separating Paul Casey in 49th place in the world rankings from Marc Warren in 51st but right now it is making a huge difference.

One is heading to the Masters in a fortnight’s time while the other is not.

That could all change, however, following the Valero Texas Open this week. Anyone inside the top 50 after this event will get an invitation to Augusta and while Warren has secured a prized sponsor’s invitation, Casey has decided to stay at home in Arizona.

What price Scotsman Warren, on a straight-shooter’s course that ought to suit his eye, tipping the Englishman out of the field for the season’s first major?

It is to be hoped that both scrape in. Under the ranking system, Casey is actually projected to move up a spot without taking the week’s events into account (proceedings at the Trophee Hassan in Morocco on the European Tour could also influence matters). So not just Warren but two other players would have to go past Casey to deny him a Masters outing.

As for Warren, anything resembling the tied-17th finish he achieved in his last start at Miami’s Cadillac Championship would do the trick. Among those who could also force their way to Augusta via their efforts in Morocco are Englishmen Andy Sullivan (61st) and Tommy Fleetwood (66th).
