A friend of ISIS hostage Kayla Mueller, who was confirmed dead this week, revealed she left her a message shortly after being kidnapped by militants begging her to help her escape and saying 'I'm so sick, I'm dying.'

Kayla Mueller, of Arizona, was kidnapped by ISIS in Aleppo in 2013 and was confirmed dead on Friday. 

The Islamic extremist group claimed she had died during a Jordanian airstrike in Raqqa and later sent her family photos of her dead body to confirm it. 

One of these photos showed the aid worker covered in a white burial shroud, intended to show she had been treated with respect. Others showed bruising on her face, supposedly a sign of the airstrike - a fact disputed by US authorities and Jordan.

Oruba Barakat told CNN she had befriended the aid worker in Turkey before she left for Syria and later received a desperate message from her after she had been captured by ISIS militants.

Aid worker Kayla Mueller phoned a friend begging for help shortly after she had been kidnapped by ISIS as she left a Syrian hospital, her friend Oruba Barakat revealed. The 26-year-old American hostage was confirmed dead last week

'She said 'please try to help me, get me out, I'm so sick I'm dying,' said Ms Barakat, recalling the message.

Miss Mueller was captured in August 2013 as she left a Doctors without Borders hospital. 

After Miss Mueller had been taken, along with three other hostages, Ms Barakat said she tried in vain to get her contacts to convince ISIS to release her - but with no success. 

Two to three months later she received a message from her. 

Ms Barakat said the message from Miss Mueller lasted 10-15 seconds and she was never able to contact her herself. 

'She begged for help,' she added. 

'I called the American Embassy, I called many people inside Syria asking for help asking if they could convince ISIS to free her because she is a very good girl and did good things for Syrians. But ISIS doesn't care about Syrians. 

But as more months passed it began to look more impossible that Miss Mueller would be released. Ms Barakat said the three other people with her - all Syrian - were eventually released purely, she suspects, because being from Syria meant they had 'little value' to ISIS. 

Miss Mueller had volunteered to help people dispersed across the world and is pictured giving a presentation to a group in 2013 as part of her dedication to her humanitarian work 

Miss Mueller wanted to help Syrians who had been dispersed by the civil war and worked for Support to Life

Ms Barakat said she asked her friend not to travel to Syria, but she was determined to go and try and help people. 

ISIS claimed they had treated the aid worker with respect - a fact echoed in a letter written by Kayla while she was in captivity. 

After she died militants are believed to have sent a message to her parents, along with three photos of her dead body. 

Officials told CBS that one photo showed her covered in the shroud, while two others showed bruising on her face. It has not yet been confirmed how she died.

An intelligence assessment has also revealed she may have been offered as a bride to an ISIS fighter. 

During her time in captivity the family also received a video featured the aid worker, forcibly filmed by ISIS as proof she was still alive.  

Miss Mueller's parents have released a letter their daughter wrote to them while being held in captivity telling them to be strong and not worry, and that she was being well looked after (full transcript below) 

Miss Mueller had been working with humanitarian groups helping Syrian refugees dispersed by the civil war when she left for Syria. 

He attitude and dedication to her volunteer work is revealed in a letter received by Miss Mueller's parents, which she wrote in captivity.

'I have been shown in darkness, light + have learned that even in prison, one can be free. I am grateful,' she wrote.

'I have come to see that there is good in every situation, sometimes we just have to look for it.'

The aid worker, who had dedicated her life to helping people across the globe who had become dispersed, also said she had been well looked after, writing that she had even put on weight. She added: 'I have been treated w/ the utmost respect + kindness.' 

Extremist militants are understood to have sent an email to Miss Mueller's parents confirming her death. This contained photos of her body - one covered in a white shroud, which they claims show they had treated her with respect. 

Miss Mueller graduated from Northern Arizona University in 2009 and since then spent her time volunteering across the world - including in India and Palestine. 

Her humanitarian service over the years included volunteer work at a women's shelter in her hometown of Prescott, as well as work at an HIV/AIDS clinic.

She has even been praised by American president Barack Obama, who previously said: 'She epitomized all that is good in our world.' 

Everyone, If you are receiving this letter it means I am still detained but my cell mates (starting from 11/2/2014) have been released.

I have asked them to contact you + send you this letter.

It's hard to know what to say.

Please know that I am in a safe location, completely unharmed + healthy(put on weight in fact); I have been treated w/ the utmost respect + kindness. I wanted to write you all a well thought out letter (but I

didn't know if my cellmates would be leaving in the coming days or the coming months restricting my time but primarily) I could only but write the letter a paragraph at a time, just the thought of you all sends me into a fit of tears.

If you could say I have 'suffered' at all throughout this whole experience it is only in knowing how much suffering I have put you all through; I will never ask you to forgive me as I do not deserve forgiveness.

I remember mom always telling me that all in all in the end the only one you really have is God. I have come to a place in experience where, in every sense of the word, I have surrendered myself to our creator b/c literally there was no else….+ by God + by your prayers I have felt tenderly cradled in freefall.

I have been shown in darkness, light + have learned that even in prison, one can be free. I am grateful.

I have come to see that there is good in every situation, sometimes we just have to look for it. I pray each each day that if nothing else, you have felt a certain closeness + surrender to God as well + have formed a bond of love + support amongst one another…

I miss you all as if it has been a decade of forced separation. I have had many a long hour to think, to think of all the things I will do w/ Lex, our first family camping trip, the first meeting @ the airport.I have had many hours to think how only in your absence have I finally @ 25 years old come to realize your place in my life.

The gift that is each one of you + the person I could + could not be if you were not a part of my life, my family, my support. I DO NOT want the negotiations for my release to be your duty, if there is any other option

take it, even if it takes more time.

This should never have become your burden. I have asked these women to

support you; please seek their advice. If you have not done so already, [REDACTED] can contact [REDACTED] who may have a certain level of experience with these people.

None of us could have known it would be this long but know I am also fighting from my side in the ways I am able + I have a lot of fight left

inside of me.

I am not breaking down + I will not give in no matter how long it takes.

I wrote a song some months ago that says, 'The part of me that pains the most also gets me out of bed, w/out your hope there would be nothing left…' aka -¬ The thought of your pain is the source of my own, simultaneously the hope of our reunion is the source of my strength.

Please be patient, give your pain to God.

I know you would want me to remain strong.

That is exactly what I am doing.

Do not fear for me, continue to pray as will I + by God's will we will

be together soon.

All my everything,

Kayla
