People in Australia's eastern states can hold off unpacking their winter woolies - for now.

While they'd usually brace themselves for the oncoming cold at this time of year, a jet stream - a strong, high-speed air current that can change temperatures - has created an unexpected turn in weather patterns.

Current forecasts report that temperatures next week in South Australia, New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria will be up to six degrees higher than the May average.

Record-breaking run: Sydney and Melbourne both have warm days ahead, with experts predicting a record-breaking run of above-average temperatures

Sydneysiders can expect to enjoy up to nine straight days of temperatures varying from 23 to 24 degrees, which are May conditions typical in Brisbane, according reports in The Age.

Senior meteorologist at Weatherzone Brett Dutschke said if Sydney gets seven days of 23 degrees, it would set a late-season record.

Sydney last had six consecutive days reaching such temperatures this late in autumn back in 1974.

The mercury will hit 22 degrees in Melbourne on Thursday, with the long-term average temperature being 16.7 degrees in May.

Melbourne residents may also experience up to 10 back-to-back days of 20 degrees or higher, according to the Bureau of Meteorology's forecasts.

Mr Dutschke said the run, which began on Sunday, will beat the record of seven such days which was set in 1907.

'There are no strong signs of a strong cold outbreak in the next week at least for south-eastern Australia,' he said.

In Adelaide, temperatures will peak at 24 degrees on Friday with its average being 19 degrees.

In 2002, Adelaide had an eight-day run of temperatures above 22 degrees and Melbourne saw similar conditions.

Chances of fog will also increase in Sydney over the next few mornings and it is likely to be widespread across the city on Wednesday Mr Dutschke.

Bureau of Meteorology's Craig Burke added that a slow moving pressure system over the Tasman Sea caused this 'rare and significant' change.

'(The system) will continue through the central coast and South Australia,' he said.

'We will certainly see warm conditions.

'With that particular weather system we’d expect to see clear sky and light to moderate winds.'

The clear blue skies and warm weather seen in Hahndorf near Adelaide this morning is expected to continue for the next six days.

But Mr Dutschke explained the warmer and clearer conditions comes down to the southward dip in the jet stream, which has held off the rain clouds for now.

Mr Burke said Tasmania will not experience a run of clear days like other eastern states.

Showers are predicted on Thursday and Saturday for the southernmost state.
