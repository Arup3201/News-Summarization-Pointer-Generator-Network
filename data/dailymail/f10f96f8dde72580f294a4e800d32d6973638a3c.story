Doctors should not blame patients for being fat, according to new NHS guidance.

It urges GPs to be more sensitive when dealing with obese patients, using a ‘respectful’ and non-judgmental tone.

The approach is designed to minimise harm, according to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence.

With
Britain in the grip of an obesity epidemic costing the NHS £5billion a 
year, NICE calls on doctors, GPs and other health workers, as well as 
those who run lifestyle weight-loss programmes, to monitor their tone 
and not add to the stigma of being fat.

Only
people with a body mass index (BMI) under 35 – the marker at which 
people are considered morbidly obese – should have their waist measured.
Surgeries, meanwhile, should be adapted to provide out-size equipment 
for larger patients.

Last
year it emerged that several NHS Trusts are refusing to give certain 
treatments to fat patients unless they lose weight.

Patients have been denied procedures such as hip and knee replacements and IVF, unless they agree to make radical changes to their lifestyle

agree to make radical changes to their lifestyle.

The NICE guidance also provides instructions for Public Health England, which is responsible for health campaigns.

It
says it should ‘be aware of the effort needed to lose weight and avoid 
further weight gain and the stigma adults who are overweight or obese 
may feel or experience’.

It
adds: ‘Ensure the tone and content of all communications or dialogue is
respectful and non-blaming. The terminology used to describe the 
person’s condition should respect individual preferences.’

GPs
and those running weight management programmes for the NHS should 
ensure patients have a realistic view of what to expect when losing 
weight, telling them there is no ‘magic bullet’.

Instead,
obese patients should be advised of the importance of making gradual, 
long-term changes to their eating habits and physical activity and how 
much weight they might realistically expect to lose.

The
latest draft guidance is being issued for consultation and will be 
finalised next May. Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said 
patients were often in denial and GPs should be sensitive – to start off
with.

He said: ‘One 
of the big problems we have is that primary care – GPs in particular – 
have no real training about how to raise weight issues with patients.

‘The abrupt style that many have taken so far have only made matters worse.

‘NICE
is correct to say they should be moderate in their tone. But once 
they’ve got the tone right and the confidence of the patient, they 
should really think about tough love.

'It’s essential that patients 
realise that the consequences of putting on weight are very serious.’

Professor
Mike Kelly, director of the centre for public health at NICE, said: 
‘Being overweight or obese can have serious consequences for an 
individual’s health, not only physically with increased risk of high 
blood pressure and type 2 diabetes, but it can also affect their mental 
health as a result of stigma and bullying or discrimination.

Tough love: GPs and those running weight management programmes for the NHS should ensure patients have a realistic view of what to expect when losing weight

'Levels
of obesity in England are rising, with a little over a quarter of 
adults classified as obese and a further 41 per cent of men and 33 per 
cent of women overweight. This is a huge proportion of our population.

‘This
new draft guidance focuses on the provision of effective lifestyle 
weight management services and makes a number of recommendations to 
ensure that the providers of programmes, whether from the private, 
public, or voluntary sector, follow good, evidence-based practice.’

A
British Heart Foundation spokesman added: ‘Taking control of your 
weight can be a daunting task because changing the habits of a lifetime 
is often a challenge. That’s why it’s a good idea to get support 
throughout your weight-loss journey.’
