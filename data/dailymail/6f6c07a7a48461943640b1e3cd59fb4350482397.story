A Tory MP is so fond of her two cats that she has set up a Facebook page to let them ‘talk’ to the world.

Tracey Crouch, MP for Chatham in Kent since 2010, avidly reveals the views of Mungo and Basil on everything from their ‘Mummy’s’ time-keeping to what’s in the newspapers.

In October, she even found time to record the cats’ supposed reaction to her own pronouncement on the nation’s drug laws.

Lap of luxury: Mungo relaxes with Tracey Crouch MP who has set up a bizarre Facebook page 'written' by her cats

‘Mummy’s been on TV talking about banning legal highs .  .  . I hope she doesn’t mean catnip!!’ said one post.

Mungo and Basil also show their jealous side, apparently. Next to a picture of Ms Crouch with a group of trainee guide dogs is the message: ‘Mummy’s been cheating on us!! We are giving her the silent treatment until at least teatime.’

Ms Crouch, 38, who is single and a qualified football coach, hit the headlines in 2011 when she was banned from the Commons soccer team – because she was a woman.

A former aide to senior Conservative David Davis, Ms Crouch began posting the Facebook messages from her cats’ perspective earlier this year, after picking Mungo and Basil from a cats’ home.

Ballot box: Basil curls up in a cardboard box

The Facebook diary contains only veiled references to Ms Crouch’s day job at Westminster and says it is about ‘a troublesome two with a Mummy who rules elsewhere but not at home.

'We rule this house .  .  .’

This hasn’t stopped Mungo and Basil boasting that their names have appeared in Hansard, the official record of Commons proceedings, after Ms Crouch mentioned them during a parliamentary debate.

But ‘Mummy’ Crouch and her cats also have their fallouts.

Paws for thought: Mungo and Basil's page on Facebook

In July, one of them ‘wrote’: ‘Oops – Mummy said a bad word when she stood in a mess I accidentally did on the carpet. I think I am in the naughty corner now.’

Mungo demonstrates dubious sartorial taste when he records his liking for ‘Mummy’s new onesie’. ‘Sooo soft and comfy,’ he adds.

Last month, the cats celebrated Ms Crouch being named winner of a parliamentary award. ‘Mummy won an award today *happy faces* but is not coming home until tomorrow *sad faces*,’ reads the entry.

Ms Crouch said: ‘I got Mungo and Basil from a cats’ home. Nobody wanted them because of the old superstition about black cats, but they’re absolutely gorgeous.

‘I set the Facebook site up so I wouldn’t bore people with endless pictures of them on Twitter and there’s been a great reaction to it.’
