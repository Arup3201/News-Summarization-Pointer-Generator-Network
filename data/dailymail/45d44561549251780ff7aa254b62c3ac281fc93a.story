For nearly two decades, Richard and Cathy Brown played the same lottery numbers every week – without any luck.

But when they set off on a ten-week sailing trip around Britain, they had no idea the tide was about to turn on their fortunes.

The retired couple had reached Newcastle – just 250 miles into their 2,500 mile journey – when Mr Brown, 66, checked the results on his phone and found they had won £6million.

Lucky draw:  Cathy and Richard Brown, from Ipswich, Suffolk, have cut short a 10-week sailing trip around Britain after finding out they've won £6million on the lottery

Cheers! Cathy and Richard Brown, who have been together for 39 years, have been playing the same lottery numbers since 1994 

So the pair did what anyone would do 
under the circumstances – hid the ticket under the boat’s chart table 
before using their bus passes to go into the city centre and celebrate 
with a gin and tonic.

An 84-year-old woman became the largest individual lottery winner in American history last night.

Gloria Mackenzie claimed a lump sum Powerball jackpot of £241million – spurning the option of 30 annual instalments.

She revealed she only bought the £1 ticket because another shopper allowed her to go in front of them in the queue at the store in Zephyrhills, near Tampa, Florida.

Mrs Mackenzie overcame odds of 175.2million to 1 to win the prize, drawn two weeks ago.

She had been shopping at a grocery store when she bought the ticket with the numbers 10, 13, 14, 22 and 52, and a Powerball of 11. The grandmother told lottery officials: ‘I am grateful for this blessing of winning.’

Mrs MacKenzie said she and her son Scott had an agreement to split any winnings. If she had accepted the instalment method, her winnings would have totalled £383million.

Although her name was disclosed by Florida law, she did not attend a press conference announcing her win.

The next day, they turned around their 40ft yacht, named Brave, and sailed home to Ipswich to claim their prize.

As the couple, who have been together 
for 39 years, celebrated the win on their yacht at the town’s marina 
yesterday, Mrs Brown, 64, said: ‘This is more money than we could spend 
in a lifetime.’

Top of the shopping list to get them 
started, though, is a £350,000 replacement for their 11-year-old Grand 
Soleil yacht and they are considering a top-of-the-range German Dehler.

Mr Brown said they had ruled out 
buying a much larger yacht with their winnings as they wanted to 
continue sailing by themselves and would need a crew if they had 
anything bigger.

Mr Brown also has his eye on a new 
Porsche 911 – but Mrs Brown is content to carry on driving their 
three-year-old VW Passat estate.

The former journalists, who have been 
sailing for 30 years, had swapped their four bedroom country house in 
Suffolk for a cheaper home of the same size in Ipswich in 2005 so that 
they could afford to buy their £100,000 yacht.

They set off from Ipswich on Mr Brown’s birthday on May 25 to sail around Britain for a second time.

Before they left, Mr Brown had bought a
 month’s worth of lottery tickets from their local Sainsbury’s store.

The couple have been playing the same numbers – 3, 5, 25, 33, 34 and 35 –
 since 1994 and play twice a week.

Life changing: Cathy and Richard Brown abandoned their round-Britain sailing trip after they found out they'd won the lottery 250 miles in to their 2,500-mile journey

They discovered they had won in last 
Wednesday’s draw when Mr Brown used the National Lottery app on his 
mobile phone to check their numbers the next evening.

He said: ‘Cathy 
was looking over my shoulder and we both realised we had four, then five
 and then six of the numbers.

‘I turned to my wife and said “You’re a
 millionaire”. We stashed the ticket in the locker under the chart table
 on board and figured it would be safe there for the journey back – 
there aren’t many pirates in the North Sea.’

New life: The retired couple, who were taking a dream trip around the coast of Britain, can now afford to buy a larger yacht such as this 98ft Princess Motor Yacht, should they wish to continue the rest of their journey in style

Expensive: But while the couple could afford to buy the £6m 98ft Princess yacht, which can accommodate 10 guests and has a large saloon, pictured, they could probably only keep it running for six months with their winnings

They will now abandon their planned 
ten-week voyage, but may sail to France instead. ‘I’m not a big fan of 
long-distance sailing so we won’t do an around-the-world trip,’ Mr Brown
 said.

‘But we may sail to Brittany for a bit
 of sun.’ The couple, who do not have children, worked at the East 
Anglian Daily Times – where Mr Brown was deputy editor and Mrs Brown a 
features writer – until they were made redundant.

Mrs Brown said she had
 not decided whether to continue her part time job on sailing magazine 
Cruising.

She said: ‘We have great friends and 
already had a great life before the win. This is simply the very nice, 
top of the range, icing on the cake.’ 

‘We are going to have an awful lot of 
fun giving a significant part of it away, both to relatives, friends and
 charities and good causes close to our hearts.’

‘I am still walking about in a bit of a daze at the change in our circumstances.’
