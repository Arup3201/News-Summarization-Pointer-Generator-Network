A 70-year-old politician with a long and distinguished career behind him was facing embarrassment today after it was revealed his young wife had not only conducted an extra-marital affair but also made a sex tape.

California State treasurer Bill Lockyer has an eight-year-old son with wife of ten years Nadia, 40, who is currently in rehab for unspecified chemical dependency.

He is believed to have the tape in his possession but is refusing to comment on claims he was being blackmailed by his wife's ex-lover, who she had met in a previous stint in a rehab clinic.

The revelation comes to light following an alleged assault on Mrs Lockyer by a man she described as a stalker in a hotel room on February 3.

Golden couple: California State treasurer Bill Lockyer and his wife Nadia at last year's Oscars. The veteran politician was allegedly given a sex tape six weeks ago featuring his wife, 40, and a man she met during a stint in rehab

Some reports claim that the ex-lover who made the sex tape and the hotel room assailant are the same man, Stephen Chikhani, 35, but the DA's office refused to confirm it.

Mrs Lockyer was hospitalised following the incident around 3am at the Homewood Suites in Newark, California.

Mr Chikhani claimed
that he acted in self-defense after Mrs Lockyer invited him to the 
hotel. He also revealed that he had been having a year-long affair with 
the politician's wife after they met in rehab while she was battling an 
alcohol addiction.

No arrests have been made since the 
hotel room incident earlier this month and Chikani revealed he had since
been in contact with Mrs Lockyer. Police referred all questions about 
the matter to the Attorney General's office who were yet to make a 
comment.

The fight was reportedly down to the fact Mrs Lockyer, an Alameda County Supervisor, was jealous that Chikani may have been seeing other women.

Kevin Dunleavy from the DA's office 
told the San Francisco Chronicle that the Lockyers had been in touch at 
the start of the year because Mrs Lockyer had felt she was being 
'stalked'.

A sex tape of Mrs Lockyer and an unidentified man was reportedly given to her 70-year-old husband six weeks ago.

Mr Lockyer contacted
the DA's office to obtain a restraining order against 
the man, suggesting that the alleged meth user might make the tape public.The DA's office refused to confirm this to MailOnline.

Although several officers were 
assigned to the case, it is believed that the relationship was 
consensual after text messages and explicit photographs of Mrs Lockyer 
and her lover were discovered.

The DA's office told the Chronicle that 
the office 'had nothing at all about a tape and blackmail'.

State treasurer Mr Lockyer also told the Chronicle on February 12 that his wife's ex-boyfriend 'seems to have a long history of involvement with the criminal justice 
system, but her [Nadia's] only fault is occasionally having one too many
drinks'.

Romance: Mr Lockyer had been married once before he met Nadia Maria Davis. The couple married in 2003 and have an eight-year-old son

Mrs Lockyer enrolled in a recovery center two weeks ago to treat her 'chemical dependency'.

Prosecutors
have not yet charged the man who allegedly assaulted Mrs Lockyer, named
by Mercury News as construction worker Stephen Chikhani.

Nadia's only fault is occasionally having one too many
drinks.

Bill Lockyer, husband

He was released from Santa Clara County Jail last Thursday after 
being arrested the previous weekend in a separate incident for drug possession and driving 
under the influence. MailOnline was awaiting a response from the county jail.

Nadia Lockyer has been married since 2003 to Democrat Bill Lockyer, one of California's longest-serving elected officials.

His
spokesman Tom Dresslar told the Oakland Tribune that the treasurer 
declined comment and is concerned only with protecting his wife and 
their eight-year-old son.
