The heckler who was kicked out of Bill Cosby's show at the Lyric in Baltimore on Friday has revealed why he stood up to the legendary comedian. 

About 15 minutes into Cosby's set, Michael M. Crook shouted: '38 women called you a rapist!''

Audience members told him to quiet down and Cosby urged the crowd to be calm, but Crook was eventually escorted from the venue by security.

Bill Cosby's performance in Baltimore, Maryland, was filled with protesters and Michael Crook heckled him 

Many people have been protesting Cosby's shows since the accusations surfaced (Denver protest pictured)

The heckling happened on the same day two more women (seen above with Gloria Allred) made allegations 

Before he got the boot, Crook added: 'Tell the one about how to get away with rape', the City Paper reported. 

It was not difficult for security to find Crook as most of the 2,500 seats in the venue were empty. 

Crook discussed why he did what he did: 'I stood up to Bill Cosby tonight because I believe the 38 women who have come forward so far to accuse him of raping them.

'I can't speak for those women, but I am determined to stand up with them and tell Mr Cosby that he cannot simply avoid answering for those crimes.'

Before the show, over 30 protesters greeted guests as they went into the venue.

Crook was not part of that protest effort. 

He added: 'I wanted [Cosby] to have to face, even if only for a moment, that reality before security escorted me out and allowed him to retreat to the comfort and embrace of audience willing to ignore those women.'

Shapiro has a box of matches with Cosby's name on it that she took from his home in 1975 as a souvenir

Earlier on Friday, two more women, Margie Shapiro and Sunni Welles, came forward to claim they were drugged and raped by Cosby as teenagers.

Welles said she was a 17-year-old aspiring singer at the
time of her encounter with Cosby, which took place in the
mid-1960s in Hollywood after a visit to a jazz club.

She said: 'He was a star. He was Bill Cosby and I buried it in my
memory until all of these brave women began to come forward.'

Shapiro said she was 19 and working at a doughnut shop in Santa
Monica, California, in November of 1975 when she met Cosby.

She said he drove her to his place, where she took a box of matches with his
name on it as a souvenir.

He later drove her to Hugh Hefner's Playboy mansion, where
she said she took a pill after losing a bet with Cosby and woke
up to him sexually assaulting her.

She presented the matches on Friday, which had November 18,
1975 and 'from my evening at Bill Cosby's house' scrawled in pen
inside.

Representatives for Cosby did not respond to requests for
comment on Friday. 

The comedy legend has continued to maintain his innocence.

Cosby's attorney Marty Singer has dismissed
similar allegations made by other women as 'discredited' and
'defamatory.'
