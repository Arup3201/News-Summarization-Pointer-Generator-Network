Dressed in summery turquoise and with a broad smile plastered across her face, the Queen was on cheerful form as she arrived to open the newly refurbished Reading Station today.

Waiting for her was an army of construction workers, all of whom were dressed in eye-catching orange overalls and looked almost as pleased to see Her Majesty as she was to see them.

They were joined by crowds of flag-waving locals, many of whom had brought along posies of bright summer blooms - much to the Queen's obvious delight.

Enjoying
 the day: The Queen looks animated as she chats to Network Rail chairman
 Richard Parry Jones during her visit to the new look Reading railway 
station

Job well done: The Queen had her photo taken with some of the construction workers who helped build the multimillion pound new station

Friendly chat: The Queen burst into laughter as she was shown around the new station which cost an eye-watering £895m to built

Arriving on a scheduled First Great 
Western train from Paddington station in London, the Queen was met by 
the Lord Lieutenant of Berkshire, the Hon Mary Bayliss.

After meeting dignitaries including 
Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, the Queen, who opened the original station 25 years ago, was shown around opening the £895m new station by Richard Parry Jones, chairman of Network Rail.

Afterwards, she officially named what has been dubbed a 'factory on wheels' - a High Output Plant system [HOPS]  train, which will dramatically reduce the time it will take to 
electrify the Great Western rail route.

As
 trains whizzed through the station, which remained opened throughout 
the ceremony, the Queen was presented with a bouquet of flowers by 
six-year-old Eadie Jackson, from Cirencester, Gloucestershire, whose 
father, Matt, is the Reading station area development project manager.

Also
 presenting bouquets were Molly Weeden, 13, and her 11-year-old sister 
Hannah, from Marlborough, Wiltshire. They were watched by their father, 
Jim Weeden, who is Network Rail's Thames Valley project director.

Royal arrival: The famously thrifty Queen arrived at the new station on a train - not the official Royal Train this time - from Windsor

Welcome: The Queen, who wore a pretty turquoise ensemble, was greeted by a huge crowd of well-wishers, many of whom waved Union flags

Perched on
 the Great Western main line which connects Wales and the West Country 
to London, the new-look station boasts two extra entrances, five extra 
stations and a new 'Transfer Deck'.

The
 Queen, who is in the middle of a busy series of engagements ahead of 
her annual summer holiday, certainly appeared to enjoy the experience, 
beaming down at the crowds from her perch on the top floor deck.

Next
 week, the Queen will travel to Scotland for the opening ceremony of the
 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, where she will be joined by the Prince 
of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall.

While the Queen is expected to return to London following the ceremony, Charles and Camilla, or the Duke and Duchess of Rothesay as they are known north of the border, will remain in the country until the end of the week.

Prince Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are also expected to put in an appearance in Glasgow, with the hockey mad Duchess expected to take in a match or two during her time in Scotland.

Like the Queen herself, all three are scheduled to take part in the Great War centenary commemorations at the beginning of August, with Prince Harry due to visit Folkestone before joining the Duke and Duchess in the Belgian city of Liège.

Nice to meet you: The Queen beams as she was introduced to some of the well-wishers who had waited for her outside the Berkshire station

Yesterday, he embraced the selfie trend after stopping for a photo with a scaffolder. Today, Prince Charles showed off his stylish side in a different way - with a pair of cool Persol sunglasses.

The Prince of Wales donned the stylish specs during a visit to Eastbrook Farm in Wiltshire, where he met students taking part in his Food and Farming Summer School.

Despite the presence of several large cows peeping inquisitively at the royal visitor from the other side of a barbed wire fence, Charles looked relaxed and happy as he strolled through the fields.

Dapper: The natty ensemble also included a slick lilac shirt, a striped tie and was topped off with a shepherd's crook - the perfect look for a trip to the farm

The prince is famous for his passion for farming and owns several, among them Highgrove's Duchy Home Farm.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, given his penchant for all things eco-friendly, part of the visit to Eastbrook involved a talk about sustainable farming from researchers at the Soil Association and the Organic Research Lab.

Both organisations were also involved in creating the programme for the Prince of Wales' summer farm school, which aims to give farmers, food producers and civil servants a grounding in sustainable agriculture.

Afterwards, Charles stopped to chat with students, casually juggling a cup of tea and a shepherd's crook as he did so.

The visit was the latest in a series of food related engagements this week, with the annual tour of Cornwall, which kicked off on Monday, heavily focused on all things agricultural.

During the three day tour, which ended with a visit to Newquay yesterday, the prince met TV chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, another man with a passion for all things organic, and chefs from Jamie Oliver's Fifteen restaurant.

Passionate: Prince Charles is a passionate advocate of organic farming and uses sustainable farming techniques at Duchy Home Farm on the Highgrove Estate

Unconcerned: Despite the presence of a herd of dairy cows on the other side of the barbed wire fence, Prince Charles was relaxed and appeared to enjoy his day
