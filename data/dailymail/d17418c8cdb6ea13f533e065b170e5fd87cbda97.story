Gloucester kick-started their season by rallying from 17-3 down against Sale at Kingsholm to secure a 34-27 Aviva Premiership win, with Greig Laidlaw kicking 19 points. 

The West Country side came into the game on the back of a 53-6 mauling at Northampton and were in freefall again as Sale produced three first-half tries, but Jonny May scored one, set up another for Rob Cook and the home pack earned a decisive late penalty try.

Cardiff Blues’ new era under Kiwi coach Mark Hammett was undermined at the Arms Park on Sunday as Glasgow earned a 33-12 Guinness Pro12 win. 

Sean Lamont touched down for the visitors before the break and in the second half Niko Matawalu scored two more tries. All the Blues had to show were four Rhys Patchell penalties.

PLAYER OF THE WEEK

Danny Cipriani 

He was in supreme form for Sale despite their 34-27 defeat at Gloucester, scoring a try, two conversions and a penalty.

COACH OF THE WEEK

Mark McCall 

Saracens’ 39-0 victory at Harlequins on Friday was an emphatic testament to the work done by McCall and his assistants.

QUOTE OF THE WEEK

‘Individual players have to make tackles. We were shocking last week. We had to put a performance together... but the one area which was a concern last week was the same this week.’
