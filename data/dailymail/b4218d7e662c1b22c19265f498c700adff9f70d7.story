President Obama today spoke out strongly for gun control legislation, saying that the heated debate ‘shouldn’t be about politics.’

Speaking from the University of Hartford Monday evening, the president pointed out the alarming frequency of mass shootings, not only in nearby Newtown, but across the country – in Aurora, Colorado, Tucson, Arizona, and Virginia Tech, adding that the December 14 shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School was the ‘toughest day of my presidency.’

‘Now’s the time to push back on fear and frustration and misinformation,’ he said. ‘I’m asking everyone listening today to find where your member of Congress stands on this,’ asking what is more important than keeping children safe. ‘Shouldn’t we be taking that step?’

Pause: The president said again in Monday's speech that December 14, the day of the Sandy Hook shooting, was the most difficult day in his presidency

The president, who is in Connecticut as part of an initiative to urge Congress to act on gun control legislation and mandatory background checks that he says 90 percent of Americans support. 

He met privately with some of the Sandy Hook victims’ families ahead of his speech, and plans to bring 11 family members back with him to Washington on Air Force One later tonight, allowing them to meet with senators in Washington about the legislation.

Twenty first graders and six educators were killed on the December 14 shooting at the elementary school, where the entire massacre took less than five minutes. 

In his speech, the president singled out GOP lawmakers who want to use procedural maneuvers to block legislation, something that the president said was akin to saying the voice of the public doesn’t matter.

In his 20 minute address, Mr Obama proclaimed his support for the stricken Connecticut town. ‘Newtown, we want you to know that we’re here with you,’ he said.

‘We will not walk away from the promises we’ve made. We are as determined as ever to do what must be done. In fact, I’m here to ask you to help me show that we can get it done. We’re not forgetting.’

The people united: At one point during the president's address, members of the audience chanted, 'We want a vote, we want a vote!'

A group of Sandy Hook families originally planned to travel to Washington earlier on Monday, but the White House offered to give the families a ride so they could also attend Obama's speech before their lobbying push.

The families' trip was organized by Sandy Hook Promise, a nonprofit started by community members in the wake of the shooting.

'The group is encouraging senators to come together around legislative proposals that will both save lives and respect the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans,' the group said in a statement.

Mr Obama teared up when speaking of six-year-old Dylan Hockley, one of the 20 students slaughtered on December 14 when describing how his mother, Nicole Hockley, said that she asks her dead son every night to visit her in her dreams every night so she can see him.

'If there’s even one thing we can do to prevent a father from having to bury his child, isn’t that worth fighting for?’ he asked.

In his emotionally-charged speech, the president specified that he doesn’t want to ban guns, only make sure that background checks are mandatory so that the weapons don’t get into the wrong hands.

‘Shouldn’t we make it harder, not easier, for someone who’s been convicted of domestic abuse, to get his hands on a gun? Turns out 90 percent of Americans support universal background check,’ he said.

At one point in the president’s speech, audience members in the packed university gymnasium began chanting, ‘We want a vote, we want a vote.’

'This is not about politics. This is about the families who are here who were torn apart by gun violence. That's what it's about.'

Amid the chanting, Mr Obama said: ‘This is not about politics. This is about the families who are here who were torn apart by gun violence. That’s what it’s about.’

The president further argued that lawmakers in Washington owe it to the victims of gun violence, including those killed at Sandy Hook, to pass the legislation, which would ban magazines containing over 10 rounds and put a ban on assault weapons.

Mr Obama said that while nearly everyone present for this year’s State of the Union Address stood to applause his stance on gun control, some members of Congress were singing a different tune once the cameras had turned off and the news trucks had left.

‘If our history teaches us anything, then it’s up to us, the people, to stand up to those who say we can’t or we won’t. Stand up to the change we need,’ he said.

The president rode to the University of Hartford with Connecticut Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, who signed sweeping gun control legislation into law last Thursday, again with Sandy Hook families in attendance.

A successful vote passing the legislation would require 60 votes to pass, which is a difficult maneuver in an 100-member Senate.

The legislation’s opposition, which includes some Republican members of Congress, claims that the bill would impose on Second Amendment rights.
