Andriy Shevchenko has been showcasing the skills he acquired growing up in Ukraine - but not in a footballing sense. 

The former Chelsea striker was a guest on James Richardson's BT Sport European Football Show when the host pulled up a clip pickpocketing a journalist and nabbing his wallet. 

Shevchenko was clearly joking when he pinched the journalist's money and immediately gave it back, with the stunt met by much giggling from the panel.

The journalist was all smiles and unaware that he had become the unwitting victim of a playful trick 

'Growing up in Ukraine...' the 38-year-old said, while the studio burst into raucous laughter. 'It's one of the skills. It's a joke from the back pocket.'

Richardson was quite happily ready to wrap up the show after his humorous tidbit, but Shevchenko wasn't finished there. 

He demonstrated his party trick by swooping for journalist James Horncastle's wallet as well - a move to yield great surprise in the Stratford base.
