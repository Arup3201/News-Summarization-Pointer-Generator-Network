A British safari guide has told of the terrifying moment he was targeted by lawless armed rebels during the bloody coup which has swept through the Central African Republic.

David Simpson, 25, was left to fend off a gun-toting gang that attacked his bush camp deep in the jungle after the 42 armed military police charged with protecting his group deserted them.

It was the second terrifying incident in the conflict-scarred country for Simpson; who had only recently returned there after spending five months in a hellish jail, after being wrongly accused of multiple murder.

David and his business partner Erik Mararv got word that 20 to 30 militia were marauding through the bush towards them.

And when their guards abandoned them, the pair took to the air to protect their clients and equipment, seeing off the bandits by intimidating them with their four-seater Cessna.

‘We knew they were coming for us’, he said. ‘It looked like it was going to be a shoot-out to the death.

'I circled the plane until I spotted them, working their way through the bush. They started shooting crazily at the plane. These were desperate men 
used to killing and shooting. 

'We had no weapons so I decided to 
dive-bomb them. I knew it would be scary for them, as they didn’t know 
if we had weapons or not. It isn’t something I was taught at flying 
school in Yorkshire, but we scared them off.’

Last year, David was imprisoned in the capital Bangui after he discovered 13 mutilated corpses in the jungle.

He
was released last September after a chaotic investigation, leading to 
an emotional reunion with his family in North Yorkshire, but dad Peter 
and mum Vicky were furious with him for abandoning the family pheasant 
farm.

‘Now they are even 
more worried,’ he said, explaining that he, Erik and their clients were 
OK but isolated, 125 miles from the nearest town.

‘We have blocked the 
jungle road so no further raids can take place,’ he said.

‘But
we are on our own without armed guards. We have food and water for 
another three or four weeks, and the plane is safely parked near us so 
we have a route out of here.’
