A 'wheel-chair-bound' benefits cheat who claimed £62,000 has been jailed after it emerged he was an international archer who had travelled to Thailand to pick up a bride.

Terry Peake, 64, said it took him 30 minutes to walk 50 to 75 yards since a car accident in 1994 left him 'disabled'. He even claimed he couldn't dress, bathe or go to the toilet without help.

But when the Department of Work and Pensions discovered he had represented Britain at the World Masters Games in Melbourne in 2002 - and set up his own business - he went on the run around the world.

Peake, of Rochdale, Greater Manchester,
was eventually arrested in February this year, at Birmingham Airport 
after a warrant was issued for his arrest.

He was a member of the Rochdale Company of Archers and, in 1999, won the Grand Northern title.

Investigators secretly filmed him lugging a trailer across a field for the business he had set up, trading specialised licence plates over the web.

When he was caught, Peake fled Britain and went to Thailand where he married a local woman and jetted off to Australia. But he was unmasked as a cheat when pictures of him surfaced frolicking in a swimming pool.

Caught: Investigators secretly filmed him as he pulled a trailer across a field as he operated a business, trading specialised license plates over the web

At Bolton Crown Court he was jailed for nine months after he pleaded guilty to fraudulently claiming a total of £62, 941.29, between October 2002 and May 2007.

Mr Kenneth Grant, prosecuting, said Mr Peake claimed he had not been able to work after the accident and when he started claiming disability allowance in 1994.

He also used a wheel chair when he went out because he had trouble standing up.

He said claimants, like Mr Peake, were under a duty to notify the DWP of any changes in their circumstances which might affect their entitlement.

In early in summer 2006, the DWP became aware that Peake had started a business, trading specialised license plates over the web - which he did not report to the department.

Mr Peake failed to attend his first court hearing in October 2007, but attended in June 2008 after being arrested at Birmingham airport.

And for the next four years nothing was heard of the defendant - who was living in Thailand with his Thai wife. He was again arrested in February this year, at Birmingham airport.

Mr Colin Buckle, defending, added: 'The defendant, prior to these matters, was a man of exemplary character, in full-time employment, until 1991 when he had a, what can only be described as, devastating car accident.'

Mr Peake spent the following 18 months in hospital, where he underwent treatment for his injuries.

He added: 'He had five separate sites of injury on his spine and was declared disabled and confined to a wheelchair. This was the case for the ten years.'

But Mr Peake’s condition gradually started to improve from 2000.

Mr
Buckle said: 'There came an improvement, the improvement was gradual, 
but for all the time the defendant had been claiming benefits.'

And
so gradual was this improvement, Mr Buckler said there was no trigger 
for the claimant to identify a point to notify the DWP.

'The original claim was quite genuine and received because of the severe injuries the defendant had', he said.

Mr Buckle said after leaving hospital, Mr Peake felt hard done by - and so he became involved with those who had suffered the same fate he had.

Mr Peake became involved in the Commonwealth Games, for which he became a senior communications officer.

He even visited all the schools in the Isle of Man, encouraging disabled people to take part in sport - an initiative backed by former gold medalist Tanni Grey Thomspon, who worked very closely with him.

Mr
Peake, who limped into the dock, bowed his head as Judge William Morris
told him: 'You are a man of 64. You are a man of good character. You 
are a man of positive good character.'

He said Mr Peake’s condition had improved and he had failed to notify the DWP, of those changes and changes in circumstances.

'It may not have been a considerable business, but a business it was', he added.

He stated suspicion had surrounded Mr Peake, after photographs of him in Australia had surfaced.

He added: 'You quite deliberately claimed benefits. This is serious because of course, it’s the tax payer who pays such benefits - that hard-earned money is simply being passed to somebody that had no entitlement to it.'

On a website Peake said: 'I took up Archery after a serious car accident which left me in a wheelchair. This was a therapeutic sport which I could do, however over the years I have regained the use of my legs and can now walk for short periods of time with the help of medication.

'I still have disabilities and am registered disabled I no longer work, so I spend my time promoting archery and coaching people who wish to take up the sport.

'I still compete from my wheelchair and shoot all over and have been fortunate to win a selection of trophies , medals over the years. One thing about archery is that any one can do it, whether they have a disability or not. Any age from 8 to 80 it is also a very sociable sport you meet all sorts of people from all walks of life

But DWP Minister for Welfare Reform, Lord Freud, said: 'It’s cases like these that show us why welfare reform is needed. We have a duty to the taxpayer and our customers to make sure that these vital benefits only go to those who need them.

'Benefit fraud takes money away from the most vulnerable. It is a crime and we are committed to stopping it by catching criminals at the front line and making sure our reforms make the benefit system less open to abuse.'
