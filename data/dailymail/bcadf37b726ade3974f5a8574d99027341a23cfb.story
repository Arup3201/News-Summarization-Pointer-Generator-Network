Former President George W. Bush said  on Friday that he was baffled by a New York grand jury's decision not to indict a police officer who put Eric Garner into a chokehold.

'I thought how sad. The verdict was hard to understand,' Bush told CNN's Candy Crowley in a clip on an interview the network plans to air during Crowley's show on Sunday, adding that he 'hadn't seen all the details.'

'But it’s sad that race continues to play such....an emotional, divisive part of life,' he continued, reflecting on the race riots he witnessed growing up in the 1970s. 'I do think we've improved.'

'It’s sad that race continues to play such....an emotional, divisive part of life,' former President George W. Bush told CNN host Candy Crowley in an interview aired in part today by the network

In the segment of the interview that was released, Bush did not weigh in on whether the Department of Justice should proceed with a civil rights investigation into the killing nor did he list particular reforms that federal and enforcement officials should purse in order to prevent similar deaths.

He did relay a conversation that he and his former secretary of state, Condoleeza Rice, had over dinner after a grand jury declined to indict former Ferguson, Missouri, police officer Darren Wilson for taking the life of Michael Brown.

'We talked about this subject, and ...she just said, "You’ve got to understand that there are a lot of black folks around that are incredibly more and more distrusting of law enforcement."

'Which is a shame, because law enforcement’s job is to protect everybody,' he said. 

President Barack Obama and the White House have been careful not to publicly comment on either of the grand jury decisions or potential federal actions, noting that it would be inappropriate for them to influence or interfere with Justice's probe. 

Instead, the president has spoken more vaguely about the effect that the court decisions had on minority communities, pointing out that 'too many' feel that 'law enforcement is not working with them and dealing with them in a fair way.'

'We are not going to let up until we see a strengthening of trust and strengthening of accountability that exists between our communities and our law enforcement,' he said after the verdict was announced on Wednesday.

Black members of Congress said on Thursday that the White House could show its support for the African-American community by inviting the families of Brown and Garner to the president's annual State of the Union address next month,

'Those families are symbols of an issue that needs to be urgently addressed in America,' Georgia Rep. Hank Johnson told the Hill. 'I think it would be an excellent idea.'

'It would be good that we put a face to the injustices that have occurred as a result of the criminal justice system that hasn't been lifted to a point of colorblindness,' New York Rep. Yvette Clark said.

At least one Republican in Congress, New York Rep. Peter King, has come out swinging in favor of the white law enforcement officers in New York, saying, that had Garner not 'had asthma and a heart condition and was so obese, almost definitely he would not have died' and that 'there’s not a hint there that anyone used any racial epithet.'

King said he has 'no doubt' that a '350 pound white guy' would have faced the same treatment at the hands of police.

A protester, demanding justice for Eric Garner, holds a placard featuring Garner's final words while staging a 'die-in' with dozens of others in downtown White Plains,  New York today. Protesters swarmed streets of Manhattan or a second night on Thursday to denounce a  grand jury's decision to spare a white police officer from criminal prosecution in the choking death of the unarmed black man

Kentucky Sen. and likely 2016 contestant Rand Paul said Wednesday that he blames the politicians who created the laws that led to what happened. 

Garner was first approached by police because he was hawking untaxed cigarettes on the street in Staten Island, which is illegal.  

'Obviously, the individual circumstances are important, but I think it’s also important to know that some politician put a tax of $5.85 on a pack of cigarettes, so they’ve driven cigarettes underground by making them so expensive,' Paul told Hardball host Chris Matthews. 

'But then some politician also had to direct the police to say, "Hey, we want you arresting people for selling a loose cigarette." ' he said. 

Paul said 'there really is no excuse for' anyone to die for breaking that type of law, and added, 'but I do blame the politicians. We put our police in a difficult situation with bad laws.'

Other Republicans on Capitol Hill have mostly been quiet about the death this week, however, preferring to gripe instead about the president's executive actions on immigration.

GOP conference chair Cathy McMorris Rogers said yesterday, however, that she 'absolutely' believes that Congress should hearings on Garner's death. 

House Speaker John Boehner didn't directly endorse hearings at a press conference on Thursday, telling reporters, 'I’m not going to rule that in or out,' but the GOP leader acknowledged that he does think 'that the American people deserve answers about what really happened here.'
