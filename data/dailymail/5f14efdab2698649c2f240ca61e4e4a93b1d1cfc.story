They may be tiny but bumblebees are capable of some remarkable learning feats, especially when they might get a tasty reward, according to new research.

Two studies have revealed that bees are able to learn by themselves and from each other.

The findings suggest that social learning in bumblebees is even more complex than first thought.

PhD student Hamida Mirwan and Professor Peter Kevan, of the School of Environmental Sciences at the by University of Guelph, Canada, found that bees are capable of learning to solve increasingly complex problems.

The researchers presented bees with a series of artificial flowers that required ever-more challenging strategies, such as moving objects aside or upwards, to gain a sugar syrup reward.

When inexperienced bees encountered the most complex flower first, they were unable to access the sweet treat and stopped trying, but bees allowed to progress through increasingly complex flowers were able to navigate the most difficult ones.

'Bees with experience are able to solve new problems that they encounter, while bees with no experience just give up,' said Ms Mirwan.

She and professor Kevan believe the study, which was published in the journal Animal Cognition, is an example of scaffold learning, a concept normally restricted to human psychology in which learners move through increasingly complex steps.

In a second study, which was recently published in the journal Psyche, the researchers found that bees learned by watching and communicating with other bees - a process called social learning.

Ms Mirwan made artificial flowers requiring the bees to walk on the underside of a disk to get a sugar syrup reward.

Experienced bees foraged on the artificial flowers for several days until they became accustomed to feeding at them.

To see whether other bees could learn from the experienced foragers, Ms Mirwan confined inexperienced bees in a mesh container near the artificial flowers where they could observe the experienced bees.

When the naïve bees were allowed to forage on the artificial flowers, they took just 70 seconds to get the reward.

Control bees that had not observed the experienced bees could not access the syrup.

'Social learning in animals usually involves one individual observing and imitating another, although other kinds of communication can also be involved,' said Ms Mirwan.

'They could try for up to 30 minutes, but most gave up before then.'

In a final test, she placed experienced bees in a hive with naïve bees. When the naïve bees were allowed to forage on the artificial flowers, they gained the syrup in three-and-a-half minutes.

Behavioural scientists usually assume that observation and imitation are at the heart of social learning, but social insects such as bees can also transmit information through touch, vibration and smell.

The researchers said the communication method used by the bees is still a mystery.

'We can’t quite explain how bees that had never even seen an artificial flower were able to become adept so quickly at foraging on them, but clearly some in-hive communication took place,' said Professor Kevan.

'It suggests that social learning in bumblebees is even more complex than we first expected.'

Earlier this year scientists in Croatia unveiled specially-bred colonies of bees that can detect buried landmines from more than three miles away.

The bees are trained by being fed an irresistible sugar solution mixed with the smell of explosives.

Experts have spent several years training and perfecting the training technique.

A hive of bees sits at one end, with several feeding points for the bees set up around the tent.

But only a few of the feeding points contain food, and the soil immediately around them has been impregnated with explosive chemicals.

The idea is that the bees' keen sense of smell soon associates the smell of explosives with food.

'Eventually they come to associate the smell of any explosives with easy food and will literally make a bee line for them,' said Professor Mateja Janes, who trained the bees.

Croatia is still riddled with unexploded landmines from the violent independence struggles in the Balkans during the 1990s.

'We have been refining their abilities for many years and they are faster and safer than sniffer dogs.

'Another advantage is that when they're not working they make delicious honey too,' added the professor.
