From a young age, Alexandra Tselios had a knack for business. 

She jokes that her life as an entrepreneur began when, as a child, she would steal her grandparents TV remotes and sell them back at an ‘inflated price’. 

The Sydneysider always considered herself to be ‘a creative business person’ and instead of trying to find a job that was the perfect fit, she decided to create one.

13 months ago, Ms Tselios launched her own opinions site, The Big Smoke, at the age of 30. The site gives Aussie writers of all walks of life a platform to share their opinions.

She admits that starting her own business was an enormous leap of faith and is an ongoing challenge.

‘You’re starting from scratch and building something out of nothing,’ she explains.

‘You’re making something for people to knock and they often knock you personally.’

But she says, despite many learning curves, creating a start-up has been incredibly satisfying.

‘I wouldn’t have it any other way. This is so satisfying. It's what I'm meant to be doing.’ 

‘You have to try stuff and then figure out how to do it later.’

Alexandra Tselios shares the lessons she has learnt from her experience:

'Starting a company is certainly not for everyone. 

It’s hard work – but setting up a start-up can be one of the most personally gratifying ventures and leaps of calculated faith one can take. 

I love hearing from people all over the country who have taken that leap. Sometimes, making that jump can involve taking out a second mortgage; a massive loan, or just starting small, whilst keeping a full time job. 

There are no fast and fixed methods in successfully setting up a start-up, but there are a few secrets that can assist those who are unsure where to even start.

A fabulous idea is just fabulous until it becomes an idea that could potentially make money, impact others and become a stand-alone concept.

The one thing I get frustrated by with would-be entrepreneurs is their desire to jump right in, and then give up within 6 months because they had not understood the amount of work it would take and the lag in time until turnover materialises. 

The reality is that it takes time to formulate a strong concept that can go to market. 

It’s crucial to test your idea on those that aren’t close to you, otherwise, you will be told your concept is brilliant, but when you go to market there is the potential that no one will buy it. 

The feeling of deflation can be overwhelming and may make you feel uncertain, but this can be somewhat avoided by testing the market prior to putting too much money into the concept.

Taking your idea to social media is an effective way to gather instant and constructive feedback.

Social media is an important tool to help test your product, receive feedback and gauge the public's reaction

Yes, people can be unbearably mean-spirited because they either dislike the product or because they love to troll but this can work in your favour if you are able to sift through the negativity. 

You quickly find out if your idea is really viable, if it needs to be tweaked or if your price point too high. 

We spent around eight months prior to launching The Big Smoke testing everything from audience acquisition to market positioning. 

Thirteen months in as a live site I am still testing, tweaking, learning and pivoting. 

It’s a never ending process that really never ceases no matter what stage your company matures to.

Something what I find important to acknowledge, and many people don’t like to discuss, is that not everyone in your world will support you. 

Starting your own business is in some ways 'a leap of faith' (much like bungee-jumping!) but it can also be a slow burn, requiring a great deal of patience and perseverance 

People are funny creatures, they battle with their own insecurities, disappointments and broken dreams – we all do. 

When they perceive you as launching something you are passionate about, they may even want to be happy for you but in my experience many fall to the wayside during the process. 

As hard as this may be, it’s a good thing to find out, because when the business is struggling or you are having a particularly hard time you want to confide in the right people.

It can be a lonely journey, but you need good people around you, both to mourn with you during failures and to celebrate your successes.

The process from idea to start-up can take many forms and there is no ‘one size fits all’ approach to getting it right. 

Ms Tselios recommends that a person starting their own business has a good group of people to support them, 'to mourn the disappointments and celebrate the successes'

The truth is, not even the most experienced serial entrepreneur gets it right all the time. 

But if I can advise anyone starting out, it is to focus on your game as an ever-evolving process of learning, tweaking and adjusting to what the market wants, the customers’ need and the industry demands.

But equally important, is to be resilient both with what you believe is right for your business, and having enough discernment to surround yourself with the right people. 

Growing a business can be hard, and it will take time, but those brave enough will get there eventually and find their rightful place in the start-up space.
