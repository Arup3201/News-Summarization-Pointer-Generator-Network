Florida's first surviving sextuplets celebrated their sixth birthday on Sunday, three weeks after starting first grade.

To mark the occasion, proud mom Karoline Byler baked 120 mini cupcakes for brothers Brady, Eli, Ryan, Jackson, Charlie and their sister MacKenzie, to take to their respective classroom parties.

Opening up about life with her large brood, the Wesley Chapel resident, who also has another daughter, Zoe, aged ten, told ABC News: 'I'm not going to lie, it's a lot.'

This fall was the first time the Byler 'Six Pack', born on September 1, 2007, were put into separate school classes.

During kindergarten, three children were in one classroom and three were in another.

But Mrs Byler and the children's teachers decided it would be best to split them up in first grade.

The more outgoing children didn't mind being separated from their siblings, she said.

For instance, Mackenzie, the lone girl in the family, has always been comfortable on her own.

'She plays with the boys, but she's used to being an individual more than the boys,' Mrs Byler said.

However, some of Mackenzie's brothers weren't so happy about the arrangement.

'Jackson, he cried,' Mrs Byler said. 'I'm not kidding you, he cried all the way to the classroom.'

He wanted to be in the same class as Brady, with whom he shares a bedroom, she said.

But now, three weeks into the school year, they're becoming more comfortable with the situation and are making new friends.

Mrs Byler previously told the Tampa Bay Times that the mornings are always frantic getting her children ready for school.

She usually wakes at 7am to have them clothed, fed and ready for the four-minute commute.

The sextuplets were conceived with the help of 
fertility treatment and Mrs Byler had been on bedrest for almost a month before the birth.

The babies made headlines when they were successfully 
delivered by cesarean section on September 1 2007.

They weighed between two and three 
pounds each.

All were healthy with the exception of Charlie, who 
needed some extra medical care after the birth, and Ryan, who suffered a small stroke and hasÂ  cerebral palsy as a result.

Now, clearly well practised in caring for seven children, Mrs Byler also revealed back-to-school preparations.

As
well as having to buy crayons, scissors, backpacks and school clothes 
for her five sons and two daughters, there is also the logistical 
nightmare of fitting in a total of 16 medical appointments before term 
starts.

She says she 
manages to cut household costs through couponing and 
savvy outlet shopping.
