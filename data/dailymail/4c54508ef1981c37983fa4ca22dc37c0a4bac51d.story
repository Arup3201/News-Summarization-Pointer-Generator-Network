Sick: Leslie Cunliffe (in sunglasses) is being deported back to Britain from Australia

A British rapist who carried out a horrific sex attack likened to The Silence of the Lambs will be deported from Australia to the UK, officials confirmed today.

Leslie Neil Cunliffe, 63, will be 
sent back to Britain even though he has spent his entire adult life 
abroad and raised a family in Australia.

Cunliffe  posed as a policeman to kidnap a 21-year-old woman, then gagged, blindfolded and bound her.

He
 then drove her to a sound-proofed dungeon where he 
strapped a fake bomb to her. Later he cut off her clothes and raped her.

He demanded a one million Australian dollar ransom from her family during the May 1999 attack in Geelong, near Melbourne.

Australian police compared the squalid shed where he imprisoned the woman for seven hours with a 'dungeon' from the 1991 film The Silence of the Lambs, which starred Anthony Hopkins.

Described
 as ‘the worst of beasts’, detectives said Cunliffe’s ‘bizarre and 
horrendous’ crime was among the worst they have ever witnessed.

Cunliffe, who holds a British passport, served 12 years in prison in Australia for the rape before being freed on April 16 last year.

But officials today confirmed he lost an appeal against the Australian Department of Immigration's decision that he should be deported to the UK, and will be sent back despite not having lived here for more than 40 years.

The Australian authorities have cancelled his visa on 'character' grounds under a provision in their Immigration Act that allows them to expel people convicted of serious offences.

The taxpayer now faces a bill for tens of thousands of pounds to provide Cunliffe with housing and benefits.

A father-of-two, he left Britain in 
1967, but never took Australian citizenship after his arrival at the age
 of 19, allowing the Australian government to deport him after he 
breached his parole conditions following his release in April.

Cunliffe has been placed in an immigration detention unit while arrangements are made to remove him.

A department spokesman said: 'The Federal Court dismissed Mr Cunliffe's appeal against the ministry's decision to cancel his visa so now he continues to be an unlawful non-citizen.

'He remains in immigration detention until arrangements can be made for his deportation.'

Australian Federal Court Justice Julie Dodds-Streeton made the ruling at a hearing in Melbourne.

The spokesman gave no indication of how long it would take to deport Cunliffe, but said arrangements would be made 'as soon as possible'.

Shed of horrors: Leslie Cunliffe dragged his victim into this shed, raped her and forced her to call her parents begging for money

Cunliffe's
 deportation echoes the case of convicted pedophile Robert Excell, who 
after serving 40 years behind bars in Australia was deported back to 
Britain because of ill health.

Child
 rapist Excell, who was once deemed so dangerous by Australian 
authorities they vowed never to release him, had sex offences dating 
back to 1965, when he raped a seven-year-old boy.

He emigrated to Australia aged ten but never became a citizen.

After his release from a Perth jail in 2005 authorities ruled he was to be deported back to Britain.

Convicted murderer and serial rapist 
Simon Wilson, who had lived in Australia since he was two, was sent back
 to Britain in January 2008 after being released on licence from a life 
sentence for killing an elderly woman with up to 100 punches.

Three months later he attacked and tried to rape a frail 71-year-old woman in Camden, north London.

Paedophile Raymond Horne was removed to Britain in March 2008 having served a 12-year prison sentence for 14 sex offences.

He lured two homeless boys, aged 13 and 15, to his flat while volunteering for a charity.

Horne had moved to Queensland from 
Britain in 1952, but never became an Australian citizen and on his 
release the authorities revoked his visa.
