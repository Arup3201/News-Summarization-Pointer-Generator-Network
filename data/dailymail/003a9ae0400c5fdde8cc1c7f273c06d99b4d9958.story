It opened to great fanfare promising spectacular views across London, but the first guests of the Shangri-La in The Shard got rather more than they bargained for.

A design fault appeared to give the ultimate 'peeping Tom' view into other rooms, with guests complaining about unwanted sights and the Shangri-La hastily erecting some modesty blinds.

So perhaps it is unsurprising that the luxury hotel on The Shard's 34th to 52nd floors has been voted the worst hotel opening of 2014 by expert reviewers at Luxury Travel Intelligence.

The global members organisation put together its ultimate list of the best and worst hotel openings of 2014, with London accommodation taking the top spot in both lists.

While the Shangri-La at The Shard was voted worst, with the capital's boutique hotel Han Yard taking third place, the independent Beaumont hotel in London's Mayfair was praised for its Art Deco-inspired rooms and perfect service and took first place for the best hotel opening of the year.

Andy Murray's Cromlix House was also praised by the organisation, taking 10th place in the best hotel openings list and praised for creating 'a stand out country house hotel experience, enhanced by warm and caring staff, who are mostly locals.' 

So, who else got it right this year and who got it  wrong? Here we give you the best and worst new luxury hotels of 2014.....

The worst of the lot: A design fault at Shangri-La means guests can look into neighbouring rooms

Best of the best: The Beaumont in London opened in September and was deemed 'perfect' by LTI's experts

THE BEST

1. Beaumont, London

Opened by Chris Corbin and Jeremy King, famed for their dining empire including London's The Wolseley, the Beaumont was their long-awaited foray into the hotel world. 

LTI said it was no surprise that the hotel opening was pushed back several times, so that everything would be perfect. 

And experts concluded that 'perfect it is'. They said: 'In fact it feels like it has been there forever, and the Art Deco inspired rooms and suites are warm and welcoming. The Colony Grill Room is outstanding and deservedly one of the hottest reservations in town.'

2. Portrait, Florence   

This luxury boutique hotel has unbeatable views of the Ponte Vecchio. And LTI loved the huge rooms and suites. 

Couture shoemakers Salvatore Ferragamo own it – and the family have poured heart, soul and money into what is a wonderful property.

Andy Murray's Cromlix hotel was praised for its country atmosphere and charming local staff, putting it in 10th place

Third place: Lowes Regency Hotel  had a lengthy refurbishment but is an iconic property in a superb location

1.) Beaumont, London

2.) Portrait, Florence

3.) Loews Regency, New York

4.) Four Seasons, Moscow

5.) Maalifushi, Maldives

6.) Cape Weligama, Sri Lanka

7.) Raffles, Istanbul

8.) Four Seasons, Dubai (Jumeirah Beach)

10.) Cromlix House, Scotland

3. Loews Regency, New York  

OK, so this is not really a new hotel as such – but the lengthy and well-executed refurbishment has revealed a property that is new in many regards. This iconic property still offers a superb location and some of the largest rooms and suites in the city. The experts love the lighter, cleaner lines of the décor.

4. Four Seasons, Moscow  

As Four Seasons continue their prolific global expansion, it would be easy for the brand (and LTI) to become a little blasé. But they rarely put a foot wrong. Here, they have created a wonderful, warm and luxurious hotel in a stunning location. It’s a shame that they couldn’t get the spa (set to be one of the best in Moscow) ready in time for the opening – an oversight, which marks them down in our books. 

5. Maalifushi, Maldives

A little isolated, compared to most of the top resorts, and on a tiny piece of atoll real estate, just 800 metres by 200 metres, thereby delivering a real Maldives experience. Wonderful island chic accommodations, a great spa and plentiful in/on water activities make this our new favourite Maldives destination.  

Fourth: Four seasons in Moscow 'rarely put a foot a wrong' and have created a 'warm and luxurious hotel'

Fifth: Maalifushi in Maldives has 'chic accommodations' and a 'great spa' as well as water activities 

1.) Shangri-La, London

2.) SLS, Las Vegas

3.) Ham Yard, London

4.) Park Hyatt, New York

5.) ME, Ibiza

6.) ME, Mallorca

7.) One and Only, Hayman Island

8.) The Brando, French Polynesia

9.) Peninsula, Paris

10.) Waldorf Astoria, Dubai

THE WORST

1. Shangri-La, London

What views! We're not talking about the amazing London skyline stretched out below you from your room – but, rather, those direct views into neighbouring rooms. And when you can see them, you know they can see you too...

This disastrous design fault has already been well documented by the global media, but we have witnessed it first hand on two occasions and it is very disconcerting. 

The hotel’s solution has been to fit blinds, but then you are in just another hotel room, which completely erodes the whole purpose of staying here, in one the tallest building in Europe, as room décor and size is only on par with the average London 4/5 star hotel.

2. SLS, Las Vegas

SLS Miami failed to impress us, but after three days at SLS Las Vegas we would have returned to the Miami location in a heartbeat. 

There is so much wrong here – including poor location, poor management and many of the hotel’s dining and entertainment options failing to draw the crowds, meaning shutdowns (or limited opening hours). 

 

Second worst: SLS  was deemed to have a 'poor location, poor management' and fails to 'draw the crowds'

3. Ham Yard, London

We are long-standing fans of the wonderful hotels created by Tim and Kit Kemp. But this one sadly falls well short of their usual high standards. It has a feel of a pop up and appears unfinished and lacking in warmth and character. 

The overall exterior look is very corporate and jars with the unique character of Soho. In time it could blossom – and if anyone can achieve this it is the Kemp duo. They have their work cut out on this occasion. 

4. Park Hyatt, New York

There is much to like about this property, but after three visits we have one important issue, which seems to have gone unaddressed (so far) – and that is noise levels. Traffic and construction noise, from insufficient glazing, is a major design flaw at this 24-hour location – with huge implications. 

Fourth worst: Despite having much to like, experts thought Park Hyatt was noisy from 'insufficient glazing'

5. ME, Ibiza 

The ME brand disappoints yet again. We have real issues here with poor management, service and food. And we are also surprised at how such a major financial investment could be followed by such low standards.
