Lucky that these school kids can't vote!

New Jersey Governor told students at a school in the state that he's a Dallas Cowboys fan.

While talking to students at Samsel Upper Elementary School in Parlin, New Jersey, Governor Christie was asked which teams he supports.

He revealed that he roots for the Knicks, Mets and Rangers.

Scroll down for video...

Sports fan: Governor Christie is a sports fan but when it comes to American Football he doesn't support the New York Jets or the Giants

Excuses: The Governor said that when he was growing up the New York area teams weren't very good, so he chose one that was - the Dallas Cowboys

'Now the last answer is one of the things that gets all of my political advisers nervous,' Christie said.

'My favorite football team is not the New York Giants.'

There was a stir in the assembly hall at hearing the news.

'It is not the New York Jets ... and it is not the Philadelphia Eagles,' Christie continued with the students on tenterhooks.

Little chat: The Governor had already admitted to being a fan of the Cowboys -- as well as the more locally acceptable New York Mets, Knicks and Rangers -- back in 2010

Glory supporter? Of course, there are plenty of other reasons why the Governor may be a keen supporter of the Dallas Cowboys...

'Get ready now. My favorite football team are the Dallas Cowboys ... which by the way is not the smartest thing for the Governor of New Jersey to want to be is a fan of the Dallas Cowboys.'

There was uproar in the hall and the students booed loudly. Governor Christie could only shake his head as he listened in amusement.

The governor explained that his father was a Giants fan but he grew up a fan of the Cowboys and Roger Staubach.

'The Giants and the Jets pretty much stunk when I was a kid,' Christie said.

'And my father was a Giants fan and I used to remember watching him when I was eight, nine-years-old. Every Sunday, he would watch the Giants and yell at the TV set.

I used to think to myself, why would I want to root for a team that makes you angry? So I decided not to and the Cowboys were really good back then.'

Christie's support of an out-of-state team may lead some to question how much he values loyalty in his life.

Many Republicans took issue with the fact that Christie met with and praised President Obama just days before the 2012 election after Hurricane Sandy hit.

Christie, a popular governor widely seen as a possible Republican contender in 2016, frustrated some in the Romney campaign who feared he had given what was a critical boost to Obama, a Democrat.

'If the president of United States comes here and he's willing to help my people and he does it then I'm gonna say nice things about him because he's earned it.'

'Obama provided help to my people at one of the worst crises that this state has ever faced,' Christie added.

'When somebody does a good job, they deserve credit.'

Will lead many to question Christie's loyalty once again after he backed President Obama in the wake of Hurricane Sandy prior to the 2012 election
