She has one of the most famous wardrobes in the world and nearly everything she wears sells out - so it's no surprise that the Duchess of Cambridge has been crowned 2014's most stylish woman.

The future Queen, 32, beat Victoria Beckham, 40, into second place and Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, 31, into third, in a new poll of 2,000 Britons. 

Runners up included actresses Emma Watson, 24, and Jessica Alba, 33, and Ultimo model Abbey Clancy, 28.

Striking: Yesterday saw the Duchess arrive at Sandringham church in a chic herringbone tweet coat

At the other end of the spectrum was former glamour model Katie Price who was named the least stylish woman of 2014 thanks to her garish dress sense.

Another fashion flop was Kim Kardashian who, despite her much-vaunted makeover and American Vogue cover, was just behind Ms Price in the poll.

But it was the Duchess of Cambridge who amassed the most plaudits, thanks to her pitch-perfect ensembles.

Highlights from this year include the stunning white Zimmerman dress worn during April's visit to Sydney and the dramatic Diane von Furstenburg number worn for the Royal Variety Performance.

Also popular was the recycled Jenny Packham teal gown worn for a gala dinner in New York earlier this month and the pink Mulberry coat worn for a visit to the 9/11 memorial during the same trip. 

Speaking about the results, a spokeswoman for beauty website feelunique.com, which commissioned the study, said: 'The nation fell in love with Kate Middleton as soon as her engagement to Prince William was announced.

'She never fails to impress at any of her public appearances, even during her pregnancies, so it's not at all surprising that she has been voted the most stylish woman of 2014.

'Similarly Victoria Beckham, who is never out of the limelight, is rarely spotted looking anything less than immaculate.

'Over the years her style has changed considerably which is a sign of her commitment to fashion.'

Welsh mezzo-soprano signer, Katherine Jenkins, 34, well known for her elegant dress-sense when on stage reached fifth in the poll, while  actress Angelina Jolie, 39, came sixth.

Singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, 25, who rarely makes bad decisions when it comes to her outfits, came seventh alongside  Keira Knightley, 29, who is currently the face of Chanel's Coco Mademoiselle perfume.

The top 10 is completed by former Pussycat Doll and X Factor judge Nicole Scherzinger, 36, who has recently started her own online clothing range and Friends star Jennifer Aniston, 45.

Myleene Klass, 36 appeared in the list in eleventh place, while Hunger Games lead actress Jennifer Lawrence, 24, also made the top 20.

They were joined by Australian pop princess Kylie Minogue, 46, fashion icon Kate Moss, 40 and Britain's Got Talent judge Amanda Holden, 43, among others.

Joining Kim Kardashian and Katie Price at the top of the least stylish poll was Lady Gaga in third and I'm A Celebrity quitter and TOWIE regular, Gemma Collins. 

'It's encouraging to see women of all ages, shapes and sizes dominating the poll,' added the spokeswoman.

'The key to their style is the fact they have all found an image that suits them and they dress accordingly.'

At the bottom: Katie Price was named the least stylish woman thanks to her garish dress sense

Oh dear: Her love of revealing jumpsuits and bizarre lip-themed ensembles counted against her

Not good: Despite her much-vaunted makeover, Kim Kardashian's dress sense failed to impress

Requires improvement: Lady Gaga came third in the worst-dressed poll and Gemma Collins came fourth
