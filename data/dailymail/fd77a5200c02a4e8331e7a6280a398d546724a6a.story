Real estate mogul and 'The Apprentice' star Donald Trump isn't running for president yet, but he is sounding more and more like someone who believes there's a path to the White House opening up before him.

'I can tell you there's a very substantial chance I will (run),' Trump told MailOnline in an interview Monday before he spoke at an event hosted by the Economic Club of Washington.

But 'I don't want to put a number on it,' he said, when asked whether the chance of a Trump candidacy was better than 50-50. 

He is, however, lining up support in key early primary states and taking pre-emptive swipes at potential rivals, both classic behaviors of the species POTUS seekus. 

Next month Trump will appear at three separate events in Iowa, one of the three marquee states whose Republican voters will anoint a front-runner in the 2016 presidential nomination contest. 

READY FOR HIS FIRESIDE CHAT: Trump's no-holds-barred style draws massive crowds, and he insists his hair is all-natural

EARLY THROWDOWN: Trump claimed conservative Republican Sen. Ted Cruz 'has a problem because he was born in Canada,' raising the specter of a new birther controversy

One of those speaking engagements will be a 'freedom summit' where he will jockey for stage time with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, former neurosurgeon Ben Carson, former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, former Pennsylvania U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum, former U.S. ambassador John Bolton and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina – all names familiar to those in the 2016 campaign-watching business. 

Sources tell MailOnline that Trump also has political events lined up in New Hampshire and South Carolina – the other two crucial early primary states – although they haven't yet been announced publicly.

'Everybody wants me in there,' Trump said of his nationwide support among Republican leaders.

'I helped lots of people get elected (this year). I did lots of robocalls for people. Everybody I did a robocall for won.'

A GOP political operative in Iowa said Monday night that Trump is 'one of a kind, and that scares the hell out of a lot of people.'

'I don't think he's serious, but can you imagine if he were?' the campaign adviser asked. 'Holy s**t, would that be fun to watch. And he's so rich he wouldn't have to kiss anyone's *ss for donations'

'He's a loose cannon with a private jet. I can't wait.' 

During his public remarks Monday evening, Trump reiterated that he is 'considering' a run 'very strongly. A lot of people believe I'm having fun with it, and I enjoy the process, but the country's in serious trouble.'

'I think we need someone very good, very fast, or we'll be in a lot of trouble,' Trump said, scoffing at critics who say 'that I'm playing games.'

He said he would announce a decision 'sometime after the beginning of the year. Probably sometime in March, April or May.'

The billionaire insisted that he 'would rather do what I'm doing than run for president, but I love the country more.' 

'Until I see someone I think is outstanding, I'd be inclined to do it.'

MailOnline asked him on Monday for his estimation of six potential presidential front-runners, including three Democrats and three fellow Republicans.

Former Secretary of State and U.S. Senator Hillary Clinton, he said, is 'a front-runner, but we've seen that before,' referring to her 2008 crash-and-burn at the hands of Barack Obama.

Trump cautioned that Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, another Democrat, could give Hillary her 2016 Waterloo moment.

'If she runs it's going to be very tough for Hillary,' he said. 'I don't know if it's going to be that easy for her to get the nomination. I would say Elizabeth Warren is going to be competition for her.'

Trump said he likes Vice President Joe Biden, but 'I don't think he's going to be a factor.'

A Monmouth University poll released Monday morning indicates he's right: Biden attracted the support of just 2 per cent of Democrats. 

On the Republican side, he had much harsher things to say – an indication that he has a primary fight on his mind.

Outgoing Texas Gov. Rick Perry, he said, will continue to be dogged by a 2011 debate misstep – the infamous 'Oops' moment – that saw him unable to come up with the names of three federal agencies he had pledged to shut down if he won the White House.

'It's going to be very hard for him – because of what happened the last time around,' Trump said.

Then the knives came out.

'I'm a Republican but the last thing we need is another Bush,' he said, referring to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. 'And his position on immigration is ridiculous.'

SMACKDOWN: Trump predicted that Hilary Clinton (left), the early Democratic presidential favorite, will face a serious challenge from Massachusetts en. Elizabeth Warren (right) who has staked out more liberal positions

'LOOSE CANNON WITH A PRIVATE JET': One Iowa campaign adviser who works for GOP candidates said a Trump candidacy would be a blast to watch

'THE LAST THING WE NEED IS ANOTHER BUSH': The 'Apprentice' star jabbed at former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush for his position on immigration that mirrors President Barack Obama's

Bush stands out among GOP 2016 hopefuls as the most friendly to Obama's executive decision to guarantee millions of illegal immigrants a deportation-free two years until he leaves office.

And Sen. Cruz might attract his own birther controversy, Trump suggested.

'Ted Cruz has a problem because he was born in Canada. He admits he was born in Canada, and I assume that's a problem,' he told MailOnline.

The Calgary-born Cruz's father began his life in Cuba and later became a U.S. citizen. His mother was born in the United States. That, say most quoted experts, is enough for Cruz to satisfy the constitutional requirement that only a 'natural born citizen' can be elected president.

A Cruz spokesperson confirmed that outlook late Monday night, saying that 'Sen. Cruz is a U.S. citizen by birth, having been born to an American mother.'

Trump famously courted controversy by taking credit for Obama's belated release in 2011 of his long-form birth certificate. 

'I am really honored and I am really proud, that I was able to do something that nobody else could do,' he said at the time, citing his own bush-beating with public questions about the president's heritage.

Trump later offered to donate $5 million to a charity of Obama's choosing if he would release his college and passport applications before October 2012. 

He explained this year at the National Press Club that he believes the president may have falsely claimed to have been a Kenyan national in order to ease his admission to elite universities in the U.S.

Asked to think of a 'single nice thing' to say about the president during a press gaggle after his Economic Club speech, Trump shrugged. 

'The one good thing you can say is that he's a good campaigner,' he said. 'But he did it fraudulently because the things he said weren't so.'

NOT A FACTOR: Trump doesn't expect Vice President Joe Biden to make any noise at all in the 2016 presidential contest

Trump couldn't come up with anything nice to say about Mrs. Clinton.

'Hillary is someone I know very well,' he said, adding that Bill and Hillary Clinton 'are members of clubs that I have.'

'And it's going to be interesting with Hillary. I think Hillary is going to have some opposition. I don't know if it's going to be that easy for her to get the nomination.'

Trump told a capacity audience at the Marriott Marquis hotel in D.C. that America's deteriorating economic conditions would require the next U.S. president to re-think the nation's economic policies.

The real unemployment rate, he said, isn't the 5.8 per cent figure that the Bureau of Labor Statistics claims.

'It's probably 20 per cent,' he said, accounting for part-time workers and millions who have 'given up' on the labor market.

He also told MailOnline that Senate Democrats' recent release of a 'partisan' report condemning the Central Intelligence Agency's controversial terrorist-torture program 'was an outrage.'

'We paid $40 million for a report that should have never been even contemplated,' he said, suddenly animated. 'And I think it's a great embarrassment to this country, to the CIA, to patriots. I think it's something that should have never even been thought of.' 

He also said he constantly has to push back against reports that claim he wears the world's worst toupee.

'It's legitimately my hair,' Trump insisted, drawing laughs.
