Are you reading this on your phone? It could well be giving you 'tech neck' - creases developed from constant tablet use.

A reported rise in the number of women undergoing non-surgical facial rejuvenation treatments - like energy assisted skin tightening and neck Botox - is apparently down to a new phenomenon called ‘phone face'. 

Aesthetic practitioners believe that the nation’s love of their smart phones is behind the sharp increase in women opting for facial rejuvenation treatments, as patients flock to correct the damage caused by looking down at their devices - often for hours at a time.

Constant texting, flirting on Tinder, checking Facebook and even playing popular games like Candy Crush have all been attributed to the rise in women seeking rejuvenation treatments to improve the look of their lower face and neck.

'We’re inundated with patients turning to non-invasive treatments like Botox and Exilis skin tightening in the hope of correcting the effects of "phone face" or mobile overuse,' explains Dr Lamia Eltohamy, a facial rejuvenation expert from Cavendish Clinic & Medispa in London.

'Every week we are visited by patients hoping to erase the neck creases they’ve developed as a result of spending so much time on device like iPhones and Kindles. 

She continued: 'Many of them blame dating apps like Tinder, which some love-struck clients have told us they spend hours a day on.

'Our patients know where the lines have come from, but would rather seek treatment than give up using their technology.'

Mary Jenson, 59, believes that she developed tech neck after regularly using FaceTime to speak to her daughter (Pictured: left, before and right, after) 

Experts in the beauty industry claim that Botox  smooths out horizontal lines on the neck. 

When injected into the platysma muscles - the strip of muscles that stand out from the neck when you grimace - it releases the tension and improves how the neck looks; both vertically and along the horizontal lines.

Exilis, meanwhile, is a handheld device, which beauticians say boosts and stimulates collagen production - helping skin look more plump and fresh for up to 24 months. It also promises to tighten the skin, making it appear more firm.

Two women underwent the 30-minute £300 Exilis skin tightening treatment to beat their neck creases.

Apparently painless, the radiofrequency energy penetrates the skin and promises to offer an instant effect, although the full results can take several weeks to appear.

Speaking about the reason why she opted for it, Mary Jenson, 59, from London, explained: 'Just because I’m a bit older people, assume I don’t use technology or have a device like an iPhone, but that’s not the case. 

'I actually chose to have skin tightening around my jawline after seeing myself on FaceTime, a mobile app used like Skype to video chat. 

'I use it to talk to my daughter now she has moved abroad, but I was horrified when I saw myself on my iPhone. 

'Since getting the device, I spend a lot of time texting my family and using social media to stay in touch with them so when I visited the clinic they weren’t surprised by my neck lines and creased skin around and under my jaw. 

'I had four sessions on my lower face to improve the firmness of the skin and it has improved my self-esteem a lot.'

The second lady, Sarah Weiss, 39, from Essex, felt she looked old beyond her years. 

She said: 'I decided to try it because I felt like I looked older than I was. 

'I’m always on my phone - especially dating websites like Tinder and Plenty Of Fish as I’m currently single - and I work in an office as a typist, so I look down a lot. 

'Having this facial rejuvenation treatment has reduced the "waddle" I had around my neck and reduced the crows feet around my eyes caused by squinting at my phone or screen.'

The clinic believes the rise shows that patients would rather adapt with their technology than lose it altogether.

Dr Eltohamy concluded: 'We have patients coming to us now from all over the UK in search of the best treatments for natural looking answers to 21st century problems. 

'The days of wind tunnel-esque facelifts to lift the skin on the face are long gone and we’ve entered into an age where looking youthful is more desirable than younger.'
