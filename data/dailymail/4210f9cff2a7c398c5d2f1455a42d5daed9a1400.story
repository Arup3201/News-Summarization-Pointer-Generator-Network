Having been in cohorts for the past five years, you would think the Cabinet members would know one another pretty well by now.

But so many were called to the first meeting of the new year yesterday that they needed name cards to tell who was who and where to sit.

After the fun of tearing chunks out of each other in the outbreak of election hostilities, the Tories and Lib Dems seemed to be suffering from political hangovers as they squeezed elbow-to-elbow around the table at Number 10.

There were glum faces all round as they gathered for the Cabinet meeting, with Lib Dem Nick Clegg - who yesterday rejected a suggestion  to join the Tories - surrounded by some of his biggest critics including George Osborne and Theresa May.

They are then followed by, in clockwise direction: Transport Secretary Patrick McCloughlin; Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt; Energy Secretary Ed Davey; Secretary of State for Scotland Alistair Carmichael; Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Theresa Villers; Minster of State for the Cabinet Office David Laws; Baroness Anelay of St John's, Minister of State and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office; Francis Maude, Minister for the Cabinet Office; Minister for Government Policy Oliver Letwin; Education Secretary Nicky Morgan; Leader of the House of Lords Baroness Stowell of Beeston; Home Secretary Theresa May; Chancellor George Osborne.

There were glum faces at the far end of the table too, where Tory Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villers was surrounded by Lib Dems including . Energy Secretary Ed Davey (second left), Lib Dem Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael and schools minister David Laws 

Mr Clegg sat opposite David Cameron, who he accused on Monday of playing 'footsie' with Nigel Farage ahead of the election following the Prime Minister's revelation that the EU referendum could take place earlier than 2017.

The Prime Minister sat two seats away from Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills Vince Cable on one side, with Leader of the House of Commons William Hague on his left.

Huddled together at the end of the table were Transport Secretary Patrick McCloughlin, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, Energy Secretary Ed Davey, Secretary of State for Scotland Alistair Carmichael and Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Theresa Villers.

There was also Minster of State for the Cabinet Office David Laws, Baroness Anelay of St John's and Francis Maude, Minister for the Cabinet Office.

Minister for Government Policy Oliver Letwin, Education Secretary Nicky Morgan and Leader of the House of Lords Baroness Stowell of Beeston were also in attendance.  

Mr Clegg had used a press conference on Monday morning to attack his coalition partners: 'You have the Conservatives unveiling posters saying we should stay on 'the road to a stronger economy'.

'We should. But they don't plan to stay on the road, they want to stray far from it. They're trying to sell you an ideological approach to cuts to public services packaged up as continuity.

'It's a con. It's like a mobile phone salesman offering to renew your existing contract and then cutting the amount of calls you can make.'

Mr Osborne and four other senior ministers also used their own press conference to attack Labour spending plans.

Asked later what the Chancellor thought of the Lib Dems' spending plans, an aide laughed at the idea they were even relevant.

'I don't think we need to worry about the Lib Dems,' a Treasury source said.

However today in the Commons it was suggested that Mr Clegg has done such a good job of defending the Government he should come over and join the Tories.

Tory MP Peter Bone, who has spent much of the past five years ridiculing the Deputy Prime Minister, told MPs he had made a new year resolution not to be 'mean' to the Liberal Democrats.

But as Mr Clegg's regular Commons questions session drew towards the end, Mr Bone suggested he should defect.

The Liberal Democrat leader said Mr Bone was just one of many reasons why he could never join the Conservatives.

Mr Bone asked: 'May I wish you a happy new year, I made a resolution not to be nasty to the Liberal Democrats. I'm not going to break it.

'You have been very courageous, you have been a courageous leader of the Liberal Democrats, you have socked it to the Labour Party at the Despatch Box today, you're supporting the Prime Minister, you even sound like a Tory.

'Have you thought of joining us?'

Mr Clegg replied: 'There are so many reasons I could give you why I would never join and I... without in any way seeking to breach the festive spirit, say you stand as a constant reminder why I would never join your party.'
