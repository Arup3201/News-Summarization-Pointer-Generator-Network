Machine-gun toting armed robbers who struck at a New York City jewellers were sent to terrify the owner by a rival, it has been reported.

The rival has admitted he sent the two men to intimidate the owner of the Diamond District shop on the afternoon of Veterans Day, but claims they got greedy and took Rolex, Patek Philippe and other high-end watches worth $500,000 and $6,000 cash. 

The incident happened about 2.30pm on Tuesday when the two suspects entered the business on the eighth floor of a building on 47th Street between 5th and 6th avenues, just a short distance from the Veterans Day parade.

Police in New York City are searching for two men in connection with a violent armed robbery at a jewellery store in Manhattan’s Diamond District, just a short distance from the Veterans Day parade

According to police, the suspects, who may have been carrying automatic weapons, pistol-whipped the owner.

'They wanted to show they had muscle,” a law-enforcement source told the New York Post.

'They have a beef over money and jewelry, and the Russian [whom the victim and his partners] are beefing with sends these two guys over there to scare them.'

He added: 'The gunman touched a lot of stuff in the store. He didn’t have gloves on.'  

NYPD initially believed that the suspects were still inside the building and blocked an entire city block as they conducted a floor-by-floor sweep of the building.

At least two police helicopters, a SWAT team, dozens of police vehicles, and K9 team were involved.

Officers from the New York Police Department’s elite Emergency Services Unit forced everyone inside the mid-rise building to evacuate, but didn't find the suspects. 

Little is known about the two suspects except that they are described as black and that one was wearing a long black trench coat.

Witnesses said the men put on masks as they entered the building and were carrying large weapons. 

'They had guns. Big guns,' witness Joseph Meyrov told the Wall Street Journal.
