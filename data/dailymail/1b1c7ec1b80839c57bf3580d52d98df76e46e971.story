The LAPD were left unimpressed by a clip of pranksters doing a 'coke sale' which actually turned out to be cans of Coca-Cola.

The video, titled 'Coke Prank on Cops,' was posted to YouTube this week with the caption, 'officer we have some coke in our trunk.' 

The clip, which has caused outrage on social media, was put together by four friends from Toronto, Canada - Kyle Forgeard 20, Jesse Sebastiani 21, Niko Martinovic, 25 and Marko Martinovic, also 25.

The LAPD were left unimpressed by a clip of pranksters doing a 'coke sale' which actually turned out to be cans of Coca-Cola. Pictured: An officer opens the trunk of the SUV and find cans of soda

The juvenile clip opens with the group standing on a street corner offering 'coke' to people walking past. 

It then cuts to officers approaching the group of four as they sit in an SUV.

When officers ask them questions, they deliberately respond nervously and look away.

Two of the boys are asked to step out the car and are handcuffed.

Then one of the two boys in the back passenger seats, declares in a high-pitched, panicked voice: 'I can't do this I can't do this, we have a bunch of coke in the back...it's not ours we were just bringing it to a friend.'

A video set up on the interior of the car shows her searching the car for evidence of the 'coke.'

The LAPD told NBC News that the clip was irresponsible and said people can be charged for making a false report. 

Commander Andrew Smith of the LAPD said: 'It is dangerous for the participants involved and a huge waste of a police officer's time.'

'The public has a right to have their police officers working and not wasting their time responding to juvenile pranks.' 

One of the boys declares he doesn't understand what the issue is and asks if it is due to taxing problems

The boys hope their attention-seeking tactics will propel them to fame, but instead they have been heavily criticized on social media.

One user wrote: 'I get pranking is funny but don't waste police time , someone could be in actual danger in need of police and their stuck dealing with you for a joke.' 

Another user wrote on their YouTube page: 'Not funny, total waste of PD time. But what can you do?.' while another user posted: 'Playing with the cops is like playing with fire.'

But the boys are unrepentant and one of them called Kyle Forgeard boasted to CBSNews:

'The cops were so cool about it, we didn't think they were going to be like that.

'We thought they were going to get mad.' 

'We're always trying to take things to the next level, we never want to do stuff that's been done,' Forgeard said. '

'We pride ourselves on originality, so we took it to the next level.'
