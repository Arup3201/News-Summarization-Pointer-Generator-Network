Gamers across the country are gearing up for the launch of the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 consoles and new research has found many are willing to miss out on real-world events to play their favourite games.

Almost half of male gamers admitted they have turned down sex to continue playing, while a fifth of female gamers said they’d missed weddings and hen dos.

More disgustingly, one in seven gamers confessed to relieving themselves in an empty drinks bottle to avoid having to leave the room with gamers in Birmingham among the worst offenders.

New research claims gamers are willing to miss out on real-world events to play their favourite games.

Sony's PlayStation 4 goes on sale in the UK on 29 November and was praised for being cheaper than Microsoft's Xbox One console that launches Friday.

The PS4 goes on sale for £349 in the UK and $399 in the U.S, while the Xbox One costs £429 and $499.

However, Sony is selling its console at a loss according to figures from analytics firm IHS.

The Colorado-based company found that the bill of materials (BOM) for the PS4 equates to $372, plus manufacturing costs taking it up $381.

This is $18 less than the retail price.

Birmingham gamers also spend the most money on gaming a year at £253 per person ahead of Liverpool on £228 and Manchester on £223.

The research was commissioned by Domino’s Pizza to celebrate the launch of Microsoft’s Xbox One on Friday and Sony’s PlayStation 4 the week after.

According to the study, although men were willing to give up a night of passion, or even going to the toilet, they were less likely than women to skip spending time with their friends.

Women even said they’d missed funerals in order to play their games, yet almost 85 per cent of men said they would never miss a stag do, wedding or important event. 

The research also found gamers across the country spend
 over £200 a year on 'gaming nights'. This money is spent on new games 
and consoles as well as snacks such as pizza, crisps and beer.

UK gamers said pizza was their 
favourite takeaway food to eat while they play (55 per cent), followed 
by Chinese (27 per cent) and Indian (15 per cent).

Surprisingly,
 one in five gamers admitted to staying up for at least 30 consecutive 
hours playing their favourite games, and five per cent of male gamers 
said to have been so caught up in the action they even missed Christmas
 lunch.

Domino’s spokesman Simon Wallis said: ‘With the number of new launches coming up this month, including PS4 and Xbox One, we’re expecting a spike in orders from across the country as gamers batten down the hatches and prepare to stay in and test out their new high-tech gadgets.’

Gamers consume on average one pizza a week, with four out of ten eating leftovers for breakfast.

Call of Duty and FIFA fans showed a preference for Pepperoni, while Grand Theft Auto players hanker after a Hawaiian as their topping of choice.

And while some UK gamers admitted that video games were the ‘third person’ in their relationships, others said they have found romance in the world of online gaming.

One in five gamers claimed to have met the love of their life while playing online and Birmingham topped the list as the ‘gaming city of love,’ with over a third of Brummie-gamers admit to starting a relationship with fellow online gamers.
