Labour has slumped to the same level of support that saw Gordon Brown ousted from Number 10.

The party, under Ed Miliband leadership, is back at 29 per cent in the polls, trailing the Conservatives on 30 per cent, according to a survey released by Lord Ashcroft this afternoon.

In a further blow, more than a third of Labour voters would now prefer to see David Cameron as Prime Minister than Mr Miliband after the next election.

The Labour Party is back at just 29 per cent in the polls - its lowest level since May 2010 when Gordon Brown lost the election

Among Labour supporters, 19 per cent are dissatisfied with Mr Cameron but would still prefer him as Prime Minister. A further 18 per cent are satisfied with the job he is doing in Number 10. 

The poll comes amid growing concern in the Labour Party over its dramatic slump  in Scotland, which one survey suggested could see Mr Miliband lose almost 40 seats north of the border.

This week’s Ashcroft National Poll, conducted over the weekend, is the first time Labour has fallen below 30 per cent under Mr Miliband’s leadership.

Ukip were down two points to 16 per cent, while the Liberal Democrats were up three to 10 cent - the first time they have broken into double figures in Lord Ashcroft’s surveys.

The Greens, meanwhile, are up one point at 6 per cent and the SNP have 5 per cent, despite only standing in Scotland.

Lord Ashcroft said Labour were ‘continuing their slow but unmistakeable decline from highs of 36 per cent in July and 35 per cent in early September’.

He added: ‘This is the first week in which Labour have dropped below 30 per cent in my poll, and the second time the two leading parties have scored less than 60 per cent between them.’

Mr Miliband's personal ratings are hampering Labour's overall support, Lord Ashcroft's survey has suggested

While the Labour Party is at the same level of support as 2010, the Conservatives and Lib Dems have both seen their support collapse. Ukip and the Greens meanwhile have seen their support surge

In Lord Ashcroft’s poll on July 14, Labour were picking up 31 per cent of 2010 Lib Dem voters, while shedding just 12 per cent of their own supporters at the last election to UKIP and the Greens.

This week, only 26 per cent of former Lib Dems naming a party said they would vote Labour, while 11 per cent had switched to UKIP and five per cent to the Greens.

At the same time, the SNP’s share in Scotland has more than doubled, mostly at the expense of Labour.

According to Lord Ashcroft there is further bad news for Labour as voters continue to prefer Mr Cameron as Prime Minister by wide margins.

Overall 61 per cent said they preferred Mr Cameron as Prime Minister, whether they were satisfied or not with his performance.

The Labour leader is facing an uphill battle to become Prime Minister after the next election, but has insisted Mr Cameron cannot win a majority

Less than a quarter (24 per cent, down four points) said they would rather see Mr Miliband as Prime Minister, including just one in five swing voters and only 13 per cent of UKIP supporters.

Only 55 per cent of Labour voters said they would rather see Miliband in Number 10.

One in four voters say they would be better off if the Tories were in power after the next election – compared to just 16 per cent who said a Labour government would leave them in a better position.

A third of Ukip voters were much more likely to think they would be better off with the Conservatives than under Labour – with only six per cent of Nigel Farage supporters saying a Labour government would be better for them.
