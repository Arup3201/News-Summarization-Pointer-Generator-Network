An Illinois town that once saw one of the early 20th century’s bloodiest labor disputes has okayed a request to excavate a local cemetery where remains of victims are believed to be buried.

A test dig last month revealed a small Herrin, Illinois cemetery could be the final resting place of some of the 18 strike breakers from Chicago who were slaughtered during the 24 hour rampage by striking union miners in 1922.

The Herrin City Council agreed Monday to let historians, anthropologists and geologists continue their after searchers reported they’ve uncovered five sets of unmarked remains in burial plots long since sold to other families.

Battlefield? It looks peaceful now, but this cemetery in Herrin, Illinois was once the site of one of labor history's bloodiest battles

‘I think this is important for the city and to the families of the people already buried and those that may be buried there,’ said Herrin City Attorney John Brewster.

Researchers say they have discovered evidence of five burials, but no actual remains of victims as of yet.

‘At this time we are not sure we went deep enough,’ Eastern Illinois University geologist Steven Di Naso told the Southern Illinoisan.

The excavation began last month after nearly a century had passed since those tragic hours in late June 1922 at Southern Illinois Coal Co's Lester Strip Mine near Herrin.

The United Mine Workers of America saw rapid growth in the early 1920s.

Beloved by mining communities, hated by mine owners, and mistrusted by much of America, the union sought safer working conditions and fair pay.

This often came at the cost of the physical safety of scab workers and communities where mine owners sought to wrench power from the powerful union.

A union-wide UMW strike, one of many at the time, was in effect prior to the Herrin Massacre and even helped lead up to the tragedy.

The UMW backed the Herrin miners both because they were members and because they feared that if their mine was successfully run with scabs, then other mines would follow suit.

One thing that has fueled the renewed interest is historian Scott Doody’s book Herrin Massacre.

In his book, Doody contends that part of the Herrin cemetery contains two burial layers. The lower one, he says, contains remains from massacre victims.

The most recent dig at Herrin Cemetery was the third and came after two less successful ones that had some members of the community up in arms over fears that modern gravesites will be disturbed.

A judge issued an injunction on any further disturbances in the cemetery.

The city was later given the say in the matter and council members reversed the injunction Monday.

Mayor Vic Ritter had said he believed there'd been enough work done at the cemetery by searchers from Eastern Illinois University and Southern Illinois University.

But those behind the excavation say they've allayed some of Ritter's concerns by using a less-invasive technique of checking soil samples instead of frequently using a backhoe.

‘They’re trying to be as gentle as possible,’  Bill Sizemore, chairman of the city’s public works committee, told the Carbondale Times.

During a national coal strike by United Mine Workers of America in 1922, hundreds of miners at the Southern Illinois Coal Company mine near Herrin, Illinois were among those who put down their tools and called for better treatment, better wages, and shorter hours.

During the strike, the lack of workers across the coal fields of Western Pennsylvania and down into the strip mines of the Midwest caused a shortage of coal.

Consequently, coal prices shot up with the increased scarcity.

In an effort to capitalize on spiking prices, Southern Illinois Mining Co. owner William J. Lester fired his unionized employee at the Herrin mine and brought in professional strike breakers from Chicago according to an account from the thesouthern.com.

A hundred or so of the disenfranchised union workers met on June 21 in the Herrin cemetery.

Back in town, hundreds of others stole guns and ammunition in preparation for what was going to be a bloody fight.

They surrounded the mine and a shootout ensued, with both sides armed and firing at one another.

After the National Militia asked for a truce and Lester agreed to shut down the mine, the gunfire ceased. However, armed union men still surrounded the scab miners who remained standing.

Eventually, the standoff ended with the strike breakers surrendering.

As the union men led them away from the mine at gunpoint, more shots were fired.

Some men were told to run for their lives only to be shot in the back.

A group of six scabs had their shoes taken and were forced to crawl to Herrin cemetery. One there, they were strung up together with rope and shot. Three survived the shots and the union men slit their throats.

All told, 18 strike breakers were killed, while just two union workers perished.

While they don't agree on exactly where, scholars generally believe the victims were tossed, without fanfare or a single visitor, into a mass grave at Herrin.

Two trials followed 214 murder indictments. Out of 9 accused, neither trial ended in a single conviction.
