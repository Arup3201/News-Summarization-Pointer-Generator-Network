Cam Newton has been discharged from hospital in Charlotte after a car crash left him with two fractures in his lower back.

His spirits are said to be high and despite feeling stiff and sore, the 25-year-old quarterback will recuperate with his family after his parents, Cecil and Jackie, arrived from Atlanta following the accident.

It remains unclear when he will return to the Carolina Panthers.

Newton was fortunate to escape from his pick-up truck without serious injury after it flipped several times

A black pick-up truck, believed to be Newton's, sits on the road following the shocking crash 

Witnesses say a sedan smashed into Newton's pickup truck on the left side, causing it to flip over three times

The accident sent car parts flying all over the road in the shadow of the Bank of America Stadium 

Despite the dramatic accident, Newton escaped with only minor injuries, but will stay in hospital for tests

'That will be determined really on a day-to-day basis and we'll see how fast the soreness goes away,' Panthers spokesman Charlie Dayton said. 'He'll start the recuperation process today.'

Newton has no internal injuries and will not need surgery.

Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo suffered the same injury description earlier this year against Washington and sat out one game before returning to action the following week.

However, Romo's injury came on the field, not in a car accident. Newton is also asked to run more than Romo and takes more hits than any quarterback in the league.

Panthers general manager Dave Gettleman was present at the league owner's meeting in Irving, Texas when he received a call from his office about the crash.

'I'm just thankful he was wearing a seatbelt and everyone involved is all right,' Gettleman said before boarding a plane back to Charlotte.

He said he was horrified by the photos from the accident scene.

'You spend so much time with these guys and they become part of the family,' he said.

The driver of the sedan, pictured on the bed of a tow truck, was hospitalised with non life-threatening injuries

The horrific-looking accident was the latest unfortunate turn in what has been a frustrating season for Newton.

'You look at the truck and you think, `Man, I'm glad there was nobody in the passenger seat because it could have been bad,' Gettleman added.

Charlotte-Mecklenburg police issued no citations for the accident.

A police report states that Newton was driving when a car pulled out in front of the fourth-year quarterback, causing his Dodge truck to flip. The report said the other driver didn't see Newton's truck at first and when he did, he tried to avoid a collision.

The report does not place blame on either driver.

Like Newton, the other driver was taken to the hospital but his injuries are unknown.

The Panthers, who despite being on 4-10-1, have an outside chance of winning the NFC South with have three regular season games left.

The team began practising in preparation for Sunday's divisional game against Tampa Bay with Derek Anderson working as the first-team quarterback.
