Father's Day is a special day on every dad's calendar.

But one Australian dad reckons he's found the best Father's Day card of all time.

One proud Brisbane man was presented with the perfect combination - sweet words and sweet treats - in a hilarious and clever note from his daughter Charlie. 

The note combines the names of 11 different chocolate bars into the message.  

Count them: Charlie included ELEVEN different chocolates in her message

Dad, 

Your skin may be FLAKE-ing and your bones may be breaking but don't worry, I've got a few TWIX up my sleeve to have you looking like the MARVELLOUS CREATION you once were. I've even got a trick to have you TWIRL-ing and rapping like M&M in the car on the way to football. If I traveled the MILKY WAY or even to MARS I would never be able to find a better Dad. You make me feel all BUBBLY inside. With you, life's a PICNIC. Have a FUDGE-ing good fathers dad. I hope you had a few SNICKERS reading this card :) Have fun eating it. 

Love your favourite daughter, Charlie <3  

'If there's a better father's day card out there, I'd like to see it,' the father, Stuart, wrote on his Facebook.

The father-of-three was given a note from his daughter, filled creatively with different chocolate bars used to describe her dad who 'makes her feel all BUBBLY inside'.

His daughter, Charlie, admits that if she travelled the 'MILKY WAY or even to MARS' she would never find a better dad, adding that 'with you [Stuart], life's a PICNIC'.

The very cute welcomes the dad to treat himself to the bars of chocolates, while having a few 'SNICKERS'.

'What better excuse to get her mum to buy heaps of chocolates?,' he said.

But Stuart was not the only dad in Australia that was made to feel special today, as fathers across the country took to social media sharing their intimate and proud moments between them and their children.

Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott made his way back to Australia, for a special visit to his dad. He posted on Facebook a photo of him and his dad, writing: 'It was good to catch up with Dad this morning. I wish all dads a Happy Father's Day!'

Other well-known fathers such as singer Guy Sebastian, cricketer Michael Clarke, radio host Hamish Blake and American rapper Kanye West, who is touring Australia, share Fathers Day in Australia.
