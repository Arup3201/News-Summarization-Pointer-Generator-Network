Javier Manquillo is poised to complete a medical at Liverpool on Tuesday ahead of joining from Atletico Madrid on a two-year loan.

The 20-year-old was pictured on Twitter arriving on Merseyside on Monday ahead of completing the formalities of his deal on Tuesday.

He has chosen to move to Merseyside despite an offer from Arsenal.

Wanted: The right-back will move from Atletico Madrid to Merseyside and will undergo a medical on Tuesday

The right-back also attracted interest from other clubs around Europe, including in France and Spain, but he decided a move to join Brendan Rodger's side was in his best interests. 

After the two-year loan deal, Manquillo will still have two seasons remaining on his Atletico deal. 

Despite having risen through the ranks at Atletico, Manquillo played just 10 times last season for Diego Simeone's title-winning men and has agreed to move to Liverpool on a two-year loan deal as he searches for regular first-team football.
