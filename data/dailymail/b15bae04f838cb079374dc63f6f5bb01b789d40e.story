The ex-wife of Sydney terrorist Man Haron Monis sought refuge in the US before she was stabbed to death, it has been revealed

The ex-wife of Sydney terrorist Man Haron Monis sought refuge in the US before she was stabbed to death, it has been revealed.

The self-styled sheikh was shot dead in a firefight at the end of Monday's cafe siege which also resulted in the death of two hostages.

Today the relatives of his ex-wife Noleen Pal, said that she escaped to San Francisco from her abusive husband just months before she was stabbed 18 times and set alight outside her apartment in April 2013.

Ayyut Khalik, Pal’s godfather, told NBC News Monis became both physically and emotionally abusive towards Pal after she gave birth to the couple’s first child - they have two sons under ten.

Khalik said just over a year ago the 30-year-old fled to his home in Hayward, where it is understood have mother also lives nearby.

He said Monis  forced her to wear a hijab at all times and forbid her from contact with non-Muslims.

'We found out he was hitting her and stuff, and he was telling his kids white people are bad,' he said.

Missing her children she returned to Australia after a month-long stay in America.

But less than six months later she died in a brutal killing when she was set upon, stabbed repeatedly, doused with accelerant and then set alight in an apartment building stairwell.

At the time, Monis and Pal were involved in a bitter custody battle over their children.

Documents allege that he threatened to shoot Pal at Minchinbrook McDonalds in western Sydney almost two years before she was murdered.

Today the relatives of Noleen Pal (right) in America, told CBS San Francisco station KPIX-TV that she sought refuge in San Francisco from her abusive husband, left,  just months before she died after she was repeatedly stabbed and set on fire

According to an interview conducted at St Marys Police Station on July 27, 2011, Monis threatened Pal after they split up and had demanded full custody of their children, then aged seven and three-and-a-half.

Pal, who told police she was afraid of Monis, had met him at the McDonald's a week earlier to discuss custody of their children.

Police say Monis told her, 'If I can't see the kids more than I am now, you're going to pay, even if I have to shoot you'.

Monis also told polce that he was a former 'security officer in Australia' and that he had previously held a firearm licence and and gone target shooting.

It was not until seven months later, in October 2013, that police arrested and charged Monis's girlfriend, Amirah Droudis with murder and charged Monis with accessory to murder before and after the fact.

On December 12 last year, the pair applied for bail on the accessory to murder and murder charges.

Evidence given during a bail hearing in Penrith Local Court said a witness saw Pal having fluid poured on her and set alight by a woman wearing a 'black cape' and a headscarf, the Daily Telegraph reported.

The court heard that Monis went to 'extreme and elaborate lengths' to create an alibi for himself, placing himself at a Penrith pool immediately before the murder and deliberately and faking a car crash outside Penrith Police station following the murder, after which he claimed he had chest pains and was taken to Nepean Hospital.

The lawyer who acted for both Monis and Ms Droudis last December, Manny Conditsis, told Daily Mail Australia the pair had been granted bail because the charges of accessory to murder and murder were based on 'circumstantial' evidence.

Mr Conditsis said Monis had spent around 12 weeks in total in custody for the accessory to murder and the sexual assault charges and that during that time in prison he had been tortured by being made to stand up and having 'excrement' put on him in his cell. 

Pal's mother, Momina Khalik, has also posted on her Facebook page her anger over Monis's bail conditions, saying: 'They should have let him rot in the jail his a f***en sick animal'.

Today Pal's brother Talat Khalik spoke of his anger that Monis was allowed out on bail despite facing charges over the murder of his sister.  

Speaking from his home in California, he told ITV News: 'It could have been avoided if the system was right over there. I was happy that he's going to burn in hell.

'Guys like that shouldn't be able to walk along anywhere in this world.'  

Mr Khalik said his thoughts were also with the families of hostages Katrina Dawson and Tori Johnson who died in the bloody climax to the 17-hour siege.

'The other two people that lost their lives, we feel bad for their families, too,' he added. 'We know what they are going through.'

Mr Khalik had yesterday posted pictures of his sister on Facebook after Monis was revealed as the hostage-taker with the message: 'F****** lucky tey got u before we did. Now rest in hell f****** asshole'. 

Investigating officers are attempting to delve deeper into the mind of the madman who has already proved to be a thorn in the side of the authorities since he arrived in Australia from Iran nearly 20 years ago. 

Court documents show that the dead gunman behind the siege of a Sydney cafe was facing up to 50 sexual offence charges, including aggravated sexual assault, aggravated indecent assault and inciting a teenage girl to commit an indecent act.

Man Haron Monis massaged women's breasts and rubbed his genitals against them before raping them in 'spiritual healing' sessions all over Sydney going back 13 years, the documents allege.

He committed the sexual offences against women at his Spiritual Consultation business in the Sydney suburbs of Burwood, Liverpool, Westmead and Belmore between September 2001 and September this year, according to the documents.

Monis, whose name is recorded in the documents as Mohammad Hassas Manteghi, was due to face court on February 27 next year. 

The house where Man Haron Monis spent time with his partner Amirah Droudis

The partner of Sydney terror siege gunman Man Haron Monis posted a series of hate-filled videos in which she described herself as a terrorist and expressed happiness at the 9/11 and 2002 Bali terror attacks and the Holocaust.

Amirah Droudis, 35, appeared in public Tuesday just hours after Monis was shot dead by police to end a 17-hour siege in which he held hostages at a central Sydney cafe.

Droudis reported to Campsie Police Station in southwestern Sydney as required under conditions of her bail for the alleged murder of Monis's ex-wife, Noleen Hayson Pal, who was stabbed multiple times and set alight in April 2013. 

Monis was also charged in connection to the murder. 

Four years before the killing, a woman believed to be Droudis posted a series of chilling videos on YouTube in which she described acts of terrorism as God's will.

The videos bear the address of Monis's website.

'I regret to say I am a terrorist. I admit and formally confess that for many years I have been a terrorist, but I'll try not to be anymore,' says the woman in one of the videos, whose face is mostly covered by a niqab.

The video provoked a media storm at the time they were first posted, but no charges were laid.

His mental state had been discussed by Australian and Iranian officials several times before the siege in Sydney according to Iran's foreign ministry, AAP reported.

According to Iran's Fars news agency Australia had also denied an attempt to extradite Monis to Iran, where he been indicted for fraud.

It also emerged that Monis had apparently posted a series of hate-filled rants online which grew increasingly extreme in the days leading up to his terrorist attack.

The self-styled fake sheikh took to Twitter to vent his anger at Australia's foreign policy of sending troops off to fight overseas.

On December 10, just five days before he stormed the Lindt cafe with a sawn-off shotgun, he raged: 'Shame on Team Australia and shame on those racist and terrorist Australians who support the governments of'.

The theme is similar to that of a letter addressed to Tony Abbott and posted on his website a year ago, saying the country's foreign policy meant 'Australia and Australians will be attacked'.

On the Thursday before the siege, he complained about 'death threats on his page 'based on religious hate' and then praises Australian Muslims for choosing 'Team Islam'.

He railed against former prime minister Kevin Rudd for criticising him and the fact he was 'for five years on bail conditions' following his conviction for sending vile hate letters to the families of Australian soldiers who died fighting in Afghanistan.  

The Twitter account appears to be genuine, although his Tweets are linked to a Facebook page which has been pulled down.
