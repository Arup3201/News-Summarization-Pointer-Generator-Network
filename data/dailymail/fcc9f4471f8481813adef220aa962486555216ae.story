Bradley Manning did no harm to the U.S. military and should have the most serious charges against him dropped, his lawyer argued as he closed the case for the soldier’s defence.

Manning's lawyer David Coombs accused prosecutors of overreaching in bringing 22 criminal charges against the 24-year-old.

Private Manning is accused of downloading more than 700,000 classified or confidential files from the military's Secret Internet Protocol Router Network, while serving in Iraq.

The lawyers made closing arguments at a hearing to determine whether intelligence analyst Manning should be court-martialed on charges including aiding the enemy.

Coombs said the release of documents had caused no harm to national security and the government was trying ‘to strong-arm a plea from my client.’             

‘The sky is not falling, the sky has not fallen and the sky will not fall’ as a result of the document release, Coombs said before the case was adjourned yesterday.

The courtroom at Fort Meade, northeast of Washington, was packed on Thursday for the closing arguments. 

Assange's lawyer, Jennifer Robinson, 
attended, as did Daniel Ellsberg, who leaked the Pentagon Papers about 
the Vietnam War in the 1970s.

Presiding officer Lt. Col. Paul Almanza now has until January 16 to recommend whether Manning should stand trial for aiding the enemy and 21 other charges.

Aiding the enemy is an offence that could bring the death penalty but the prosecution has said it intends to seek life in prison for Manning.

In response Manning’s lawyer asked the court to throw out charges of aiding the enemy and giving intelligence to the enemy, saying the intended audience for the information was the American people.

Coombs said the prosecution needed a ‘reality check’ and focused his closing remarks on urging them to seek no more than 30 years in prison.

Captain Ashden Fein, the lead prosecutor, argued that the document release had helped al Qaeda, and showed a video in which a recruiter for the militant group referred to Wikileaks and urged followers to ‘take advantage of the wide range of resources available today on the internet.’             

The prosecution has portrayed Manning as a trained and trusted analyst who knowingly committed criminal acts when he allegedly passed the documents to WikiLeaks.    

They have sought to link Manning to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, introducing logs of web chats that an investigator said appeared to show conversations in which the two discuss sending government documents.       

Lead prosecutor Fein said Manning ‘gave the enemies of the United States
unfettered access to these documents’ and used a PowerPoint 
presentation to underscore the training Manning had received on the 
importance of protecting classified information.

He said Manning even cautioned his colleagues in a briefing he conducted in 2008 about the common way in which leaks occur, including through the internet or journalists.   

Manning's lawyers have portrayed him as an emotionally troubled young man whose behavioral problems should have prompted his superiors to revoke his access to classified information.     

Witnesses said Manning sent an email to his sergeant expressing concern that confusion over his gender identity was seriously hurting his life, work and ability to think.

According to testimony at the hearing, Manning had created a female alter-ego online, Breanna Manning.

Coombs underscored Manning's emotional instability, saying he mainly ‘struggled in isolation’ but showed warning signs that should have prompted the unit's leaders to take action.     

He went over excerpts of Manning's email to his sergeant discussing his gender identity issues.         

'This is my problem. I've had signs of it for a long time. I thought a career in the military would get rid of it ... It is not going away ... and now the consequences of it are dire,' the email said. 'At this point it feels like I'm not really a person ... sorry.'         

Coombs also cited memos between Manning's supervisors discussing his increasing instability and the need for therapy. But in the end there was no effective action.      

'It was the military's lack of response to that which also smacks in the face of justice,' Coombs said.
