Lloyd's: Industry veteran Inga Beale, 50, was unveiled as the new chief executive of the insurance market at Lloyd's in the Square Mile, London

Lloyd’s of London has appointed the first female boss in its 325-year history.

Industry veteran Inga Beale was unveiled yesterday as the new chief executive of the insurance market, making her one of the most powerful women in the City.

Beale will move into Lloyd’s famous ‘inside out’ skyscraper headquarters in the heart of the Square Mile financial district when she starts her new job in January.

She will replace Richard Ward, who announced he was stepping down in July.

Beale will be in charge of 900 staff, but will be responsible for overseeing a market with around 90 syndicates and companies.

The 50-year-old has more than 30 years’ experience in the industry, most recently as group chief executive of Lloyd’s managing agent Canopius. During her long career she had spells at Prudential, GE Insurance Solutions and Zurich.

Chairman John Nelson said: ‘Her CEO experience, underwriting background, international experience and operational skills, together with her knowledge of the Lloyd’s market, make Inga the ideal chief executive for Lloyds.’

Women have been conspicuous by their absence in the upper echelons of Lloyd’s, with Claire Ighodaro currently the only member of its 12-strong board.

Beale has been vocal about the need for more diversity in Britain’s boardrooms arguing ‘diverse boards help companies make better decisions, which affect the bottom line’.

But she has also said that women have sometimes held themselves back.

In an interview in June she said: ‘Some of the time we put our own “glass ceiling” on ourselves because we are not confident in our ability.’

She added: ‘I talk to a lot of women who have been working as I have for 30 years in the industry and we wonder what happened to all those women who started when we did.

‘This is a very general comment, but women tend to focus on their job and often don’t take the time to do those soft things like just having a chat or spending time after a meeting to talk to people. As soon as a break comes we tend to get on to a job we hadn’t quite finished and that can make it tough to get on.’

There are currently just four female chief executives of FTSE 100 companies, including Burberry boss Angela Ahrendts, EasyJet’s Carolyn McCall, Imperial Tobacco’s Alison Cooper and Royal Mail’s Moya Greene

Beale will join as Lloyds’ tries to improve its technology and expand in emerging markets such as Asia and Latin America.
