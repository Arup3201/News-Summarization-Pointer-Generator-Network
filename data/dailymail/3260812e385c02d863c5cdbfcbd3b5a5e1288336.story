A five-year-old British girl has drown in a swimming pool at the Evalena Hotel in Protaras, where her family were staying while on holiday in Cyprus.

Local police have confirmed the unnamed youngster was ‘spotted floating unconscious in the swimming pool’.

She was spotted by a fellow holidaymaker at around 4.15pm and police estimate she spent five minutes at the bottom of the pool.

Tragedy: The family of the five-year-old girl were holidaying in the area of Protaras

Famagusta Police spokesman Adam Kirk said: 'At about 4.15pm on Monday afternoon a five-year-old girl from England was found drowned in the pool of a hotel in Protaras.

'A tourist saw the child in the bottom of the pool. He dived in and took her out but it was already too late.

'It seems that the parents had not seen the child. She was in the bottom of the pool for around five minutes.'

An ambulance rushed the girl to a private clinic in Paralimni, but doctors could not revive her.

Investigation: An autopsy will be carried out at Larnaka General Hospital to determine the cause of death

Mr Kirk said police would be examining CCTV footage of the incident.

A post-mortem examination carried out at Larnaca General Hospital today confirmed the cause of death was drowning.

A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said it was providing consular assistance.

It
 is believed the girl, from England, had arrived in Cyprus on Sunday 
with her mother, grandparents and other relatives for a week holiday.
