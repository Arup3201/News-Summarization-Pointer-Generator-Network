'Hangover cure': A character witness told the Old Bailey that Charlie Brooks (pictured arriving at court last week) drank a pint of washing-up liquid in an attempt to cure his hangover

Rebekah Brooks's 'daft' husband Charlie once downed an entire pint of washing up liquid in a bid to cure a particularly bad hangover, the Old Bailey heard today.

The bizarre incident was revealed by Sara Bradstock, a former housemate of Brooks, as she offered a warm tribute on behalf of the 51-year-old to the phone hacking trial.

He stands accused of hiding computers, papers and other material from detectives on his wife's behalf when he knew his homes were about to be searched.

The former racehorse trainer, who later worked as a novelist, claims he was only hiding his work computers and a stash of pornography from police, not evidence relating to phone hacking or corruption.

Ms Bradstock, the daughter of former jockey and BBC broadcaster Lord Oaksey, said the allegation was 'out of character' for Brooks, but admitted he could be 'completely daft'.

'I remember finding him frothing at the mouth and close to death one morning', she said in a statement to the court.

'He had not been bitten by a rabid dog, but had drunk a pint of Fairy Liquid to try to rid himself of the excesses of the night before.'

The Old Bailey heard that Brooks and Ms Bradstock had shared a while they worked on the racing circuit. She also told how he had introduced her to her future husband Mark Bradstock, another horse trainer.

Brooks was best man at their wedding, and remained friends with the couple, she said

'While he is kind and good company, one of his greatest assets is [that] what you see is what you get', she said. 'The allegation is out of character - that he is capable of perverting the course of justice.'

Sir Mark Prescott, who also works with horses, called Brooks a 'man of great talent, a high achiever' and testified that he was 'generous of spirit, entertaining, non-judgemental and humane'.

Accusations: Brooks is accused of hiding materials from detectives to protect his wife, former News of the World editor Rebekah Brooks

Another trainer, Tom Lacey, gave a statement describing the impact in the racing world to the allegation against Brooks.

'He is hugely respected in the racing world', he said. 'Each time I have gone, I have found an overwhelming number of people asking me to pass on best wishes to Charlie. He is someone that is not only well respected by also well-liked.'

He added that Brooks has lost his fortnightly racing column in the Daily Telegraph because of the trial, and that the strain of the claims against him had begun to show.

But Kevin Perry, the racing editor at the newspaper, said he hopes Brooks will rejoin the paper once the case has concluded.

'Pizza plot': Former News International security chief Mark Hanna (pictured) allegedly ordered pizza as cover for moving material hidden from police

Earlier Will Smith, a Pizza Hut worker, gave evidence about an order collected on July 17, 2011, the day Brooks is accused of hiding material with the help of News International head of security Mark Hanna.

It is alleged that Hanna, 51, arranged for fellow security guard Daryl Jorsling to deliver a pizza to Brooks at his Chelsea Harbour home, as a cover for dropping off a bag of possessions that had been kept from police earlier in the day.

Mr Smith confirmed an order of a large Italian Supreme pizza with a side order of garlic bread had been collected from the Fulham Road Pizza Hut that evening.

Charlie Brooks denies a single charge that he
 plotted with his 45-year-old wife and News International head of 
security Mark Hanna, 50, to pervert the course of justice.

Rebekah
 Brooks denies the same charge and conspiring to hack phones and commit 
misconduct by approving payments to public officials.

Hanna also denies 
conspiring to pervert the course of justice.

All seven defendants in the case deny all the charges against them.

The Â£9.99 bill was paid in cash, and Pizza Hut boxes seen on CCTV being delivered to Chelsea Harbour may have come from that branch.

Mr Smith gave a detailed description of the order, including that the pizza had taken 606 seconds to cook and had gone in the oven at exactly 8.17pm.

As he left the witness box, Mr Justice Saunders joked: 'It will never be the same for me ordering a takeaway pizza.'

Jurors have now been sent home until tomorrow morning, when former News of the World managing editor Stuart Kuttner, 74, is due to start giving evidence.

The judge has said former News of the World Royal editor Clive Goodman, 56, is still too unwell to return to court, where he is due to be cross-examined further.
