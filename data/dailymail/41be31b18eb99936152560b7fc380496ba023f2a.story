The boss of The Onion has been forced to issue a grovelling apology to nine-year-old Oscar nominee Quvenzhané Wallis after the satirical newspaper site referred to the young star as a 'c***' on Twitter.

A Tweet posted by @TheOnion during last night's Oscars ceremony said: 'Everybody else seems afraid to say it, but that Quvenzhané Wallis is kind of a c*** right?'

The post, which was deleted an hour later, provoked a storm of complaints, and the website's CEO Steve Hannah has now personally apologised to the best actress nominee for the 'crude and offensive' tweet, adding that steps were being taken to 'discipline those individuals responsible'.

'Racist': Twitter was awash with complaints after best actress nominee Quvenzhané Wallis was referred to as 'little Q' in coverage of the Oscars ceremony

In a statement posted on Facebook Mr Hannah said he and everybody at the Onion were 'deeply sorry' for the remark.

'No person should be subjected to such a senseless, humorless comment masquerading as satire,' the statement said.

'Miss Wallis, you are young and talented and deserve better.'

The tweet was met with a storm of angry comments and demands for an apology across social media.

Actor Wendell Pierce, who stars in Treme, described the tweet as an 'abhorrent verbal attack of a child', while another critic called for the writer behind the post to get 'exactly what they deserve. From both the law and the street'.

Blogger Elizabeth Hawskworth suggested there was a racist undertone to the deleted post, tweeting: 'Quvenzhané Wallis is a nine year old woman of colour. Let's let what @TheOnion did sink in and remember that Dakota Fanning never had this.'

Fans of the spoof website were among 
those expressing their distaste and disappointment at its use of the 
expletive in reference to the child star.

'Oh boo to the Onion. I generally 
find them hilarious but I draw the line at calling 9 year olds ugly 
names, even in jest,' said one tweet, while another read: 'I know the 
Onion jokes about everything but this is inappropriate'.

The Onion website features satirical articles based on national and international news. Its Twitter account has more than 4.5 million followers.

The young actress was also at the heart of a second Twitter spat during the ceremony, after she was referred to as 'Little
 Q' in coverage, prompting accusations of racism.

E! Fashion Police co-host Kelly 
Osbourne was branded 'stupid' for failing to use the young 
actress' full name during the channel's Oscar night coverage.

One disgusted viewer posted: 'It is rude, unprofessional and borderline racist to not even try to pronounce her name properly.'

Another tweeted: 'Not learning her
 name is racist. Calling her Annie is racist. Saying she says her name 
the best is racist.'

Kelly Osbourne was among the broadcasters singled out in the row, with one critic tweeting: 'Aren't you paid to be a host? Do your research and practice her name. Stupid Kelly Osbourne.'

It was one of a host of angry tweets 
posted by enraged Oscars viewers, who insisted the media should have 
been prepared to pronounce Louisiana-born Quvenzhané's name in full.

'Seriously though, the media need to learn how to pronounce Quvenzhané
 Wallis' name. Resorting to little q is disrespectful,' Lauren Karlisle 
said on Twitter, while another user tweeting under the handle 
@crushabledotcom posted 'OMG are they calling her little Q because they 
can't be bothered to learn how to pronounce her name!?!'

It isn't the first time Kelly Osbourne has come under fire for her Oscar night commentary.

Last
 year she raised eyebrows with a remark about Jennifer Lopez's Zuhair 
Murad gown, which Ms Osbourne referred to as 'kind of like if she was 
hosting the Latin Grammys - like what she would wear as her wow dress'.

Quvenzhané was nominated for an Oscar for her starring role as Hushpuppy in critically acclaimed drama Beasts Of The Southern Wild.

The rising star lost out to Jennifer Lawrence, who won for her performance in Silver Linings Playbook.

Daniel Day Lewis triumphed in the best actor category for his role in Lincoln, while Anne Hathaway and Christoph Waltz took home the statuettes for best supporting actress and best supporting actor.

Argo, directed by Ben Affleck, was named best picture at the ceremony in Hollywood.

Although she missed out on a statuette, Quvenzhané still made history as the youngest ever Oscar nominee in the best actress category.

The child star wore a pretty navy blue dress for her big night, teaming it with a sparkly hairband and flat pumps and a dog-shaped handbag.
