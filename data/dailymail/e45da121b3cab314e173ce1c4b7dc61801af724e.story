The visitors have long since left, there are weeds in the streets and the little wooden houses are starting to rot away.

Oliver Bullman and his wife Pat devoted more than 50 years of their lives to creating the model village in their front garden.

Their labour of love became part of the tourist trail around Cambridge, with students and children flocking to see it and marvel at the couple’s handiwork.

But two years after Mr Bullman’s death, the miniature village outside their bungalow is a ghost town - a fading reminder of its heyday.

His 80-year-old widow is too frail to save it and fears it will disappear for good unless someone steps in to help.

Mrs Bullman, of Wicken, Cambridgeshire, said: ‘Tourists used to stop here in the past, but now there’s no-one to keep it looking good.

‘We were a good team, me and my husband, and we always had a good laugh.

‘We used to love spending time together painting all the houses and thinking of new things to do.

‘Oliver built everything and I did the painting. I’ve tried to keep things painted but I can’t stop all the wood from falling apart.

Community: Mrs Bullman, a retired seamstress, said the couple 'just put whatever we fancied' in the model village

Lorry: A university even used to bring visiting students to see the model village when they took them on trips to see places in Cambridgeshire

Bed and breakfast: Mr Bullman, who worked as a digger driver, was still making new pieces for the village in a workshop in his back garden when he died

Unique: Mrs Bullman said their village was not modelled on a particular place and it has no name

Machinery and labour: After 50 years, Mrs Bullman admitted there is little future for the village with no name

‘It was so difficult when he died, and I find it terribly hard to watch the village just rotting away in front of my eyes.’

The couple started their display with a windmill which they built for their daughter when she was a young girl.

Over the years they added a fire station, railway station, hotel, fish and chip shop and a church, among many other buildings.

Binmen used to bring the couple toy vehicles when they found them in people’s rubbish.

Mrs
 Bullman, a retired seamstress, added: ‘We just put whatever we fancied 
in there. The local children always loved it, and the neighbours did 
too.

‘The university even used to bring visiting students here when they took them on trips to see places in Cambridgeshire.’

In need of repair: Mrs Bullman, 80, of Wicken, Cambridgeshire, in her front garden with the model village built by her late husband Oliver

Popular attraction: Passers-by used to donate money which Mr and Mrs Bullman would give to charity when the village was in its prime

Painted tree: Mr Bullman built everything for the model village, while hiw wife did the painting. She said that she now 'can't stop all the wood from falling apart'

Local residents: Mrs Bullman said there was 'no time for anyone to help stop it all going downhill and crumbling away'

What happens next? The owner said she 'would love to try and get someone to take it over or I will have to let it all go'

Wider views: Mrs Bullman said the couple 'could never think of anything good to call it', so it remained a village with no name

Mr Bullman, who worked as a digger 
driver, was still making new pieces for the village in a workshop in his
 back garden when he died from undiagnosed cancer aged 80.

Pat Bullman

Mrs Bullman said their village was not modelled on a particular place and it has no name.

She said: ‘We could never think of anything good to call it. Nothing seemed to fit.’

After 50 years, she admits there is little future for the village with no name.

She added: ‘I have a few new trucks that I am trying to paint, but after I’ve added them I don’t know what will happen next.’

Empty seats: Mrs Bullman said the couple 'were a good team and we always had a good laugh'

Desperate need of repair: Mrs Bullman said it was difficult when her husband died, 'and I find it terribly hard to watch the village just rotting away in front of my eyes'

Former glory: The couple started their display with a windmill (near the home's window) which they built for their daughter when she was a young girl

'It was so difficult when he died, and I find it terribly hard to watch the village just rotting away in front of my eyes'

Pat Bullman

But Mrs Bullman admitted: ‘It’s not good enough for that anymore, though. It is a big effort to keep it exactly as it should be.

‘I would love to try and get someone to take it over or I will have to let it all go.

‘Everyone has such busy lives these days. There’s no time for anyone to help stop it all going downhill and crumbling away.’

Mrs Bullman has one daughter, Shirley Gammon, 57, and is also a grandmother of two and a great-grandmother to seven.
