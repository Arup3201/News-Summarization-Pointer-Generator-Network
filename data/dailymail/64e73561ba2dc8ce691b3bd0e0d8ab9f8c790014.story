It is uncertain if the mother is revealing she is gay or bisexual.

The woman at first comforts her son after his tearful admission, telling him she will always love him and support him and how proud she is of him. 

'That's very brave of you to tell me that. Thank you for telling me,' she says. 

Then she drops the bombshell.

'Can I tell you something too?,' she asks her son.

'I've had a girlfriend.'
