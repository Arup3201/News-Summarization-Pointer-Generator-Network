The derby game between Sampdoria and Genoa on Saturday was postponed after heavy rain led to a severely waterlogged pitch.  

Referee Gianluca Rocchi had initially delayed kick-off by 15 minutes, before eventually calling the match off when he was unable to bounce a ball on the soaked grass. 

Serie A officials are yet to confirm when a replacement fixture will be played.

Sampdoria goalkeeper Emiliano Viviano told Sky Sports Italia, 'I hope the conditions will be better tomorrow because we want to get this game played.'

However, with a further downpour forecast in the Italian city throughout Saturday night, the chances of a Sunday replay are highly unlikely.  

Genoa and Sampdoria are level on points in Serie A at the moment with 35 points from 23 games. Genoa are sixth in the table while Samp are seventh, on account of the former's superior goal difference. 

Both sides are harbouring ambitions of qualifying for continental competition next season.
