Anger: This poster led to North Korean officials demanding that the west London salon that produced it should take it down - they have now asked the Foreign Office to intervene

It is the must-have hairdo in North Korea. In fact it is the only style approved by communist dictator Kim Jong-un.

The Supreme Leader decreed last month that all young men should follow his short back and sides with centre parting – or face severe punishment.

But Kim clearly did not expect his edict to be taken up thousands of miles from Pyongyang in a leafy London suburb.

So when his agents saw a promotional poster in a hair salon featuring their leader and his distinctive crop, they leapt furiously into action.

The North Korean officials marched in demanding the ‘disrespectful’ advert be taken down.

However, the salon manager took fright at their threatening behaviour and called the police.

Mo Nabbach, who runs M&M Hair Academy in South Ealing, told officers that he feared for his livelihood after using the picture as a joke to promote a discount for men’s haircuts.

He chose the photograph following the dictator’s much publicised edict that all male students in the rogue state must have the same razor-short look.

Below the large image of the tyrant, the poster reads: ‘Bad Hair Day? 15% off all gent cuts through the month of April’.

It had been in the salon window for only one day before he received a sinister visit from the North Korean officials, whose embassy is less than two miles away in a converted semi in Gunnersbury.

Mr Nabbach said: 'I noticed them first outside the shop.

'They came in and asked what the poster was doing in the window and demanded for it to be taken down.

'I said it was only a poster and we have pictures of celebrities in the window all the time. They said: "This is no celebrity, it's our dear leader".

'They asked for my name and I refused to give it to them, saying "this is not North Korea, this is England, and you can get out".

Row: The owners of this London salon say their decision to promote an April discount using a picture of Kim Jong-un has led to the manager being put under surveillance by North Korean officials

'They left and I called the police just in case they ended up smashing the windows.

'We did take it down but then some of our clients told me to put it back up because we have a democracy here'.

The two men in suits entered the salon at 4.30pm last Friday bearing a clipboard. They confronted Mr Nabbach’s 26-year-old hairdresser son Karim, demanding to know who was responsible for the perceived outrage.

‘The irony is they didn’t even have the Kim Jong-un haircut, they just had a standard side parting,’ said Mr Nabbach, 51.

‘To tell you the truth, it was actually a bit scary. From all the stuff you hear about North Korea, it was worrying. The two guys were wearing suits and they were very serious. It was very threatening. They came in and asked what the poster was doing in the window and demanded for it to be taken down.

‘I said it was only a poster and we have pictures of celebrities in the window all the time.

‘They
 said, “We are North Korean officials, do you know this is our leader?”.
 They asked for my name. I told them, “This is not North Korea, this is 
England, we live in a democracy so I’m afraid you’re going to have to 
get out of my salon”.’

The pair left after taking notes and 
photographs of the premises. Mr Nabbach went to Ealing police station to
 report the matter. Scotland Yard revealed today the North Koreans did the 
same.

He initially removed the poster, fearing that either he or the shop could be targeted.

But
 following complaints from customers and locals about a ‘breach of 
democracy’, the poster was put back up, prompting a further visit at 
10am the next day.

A communist official stood outside taking photographs of the salon until Karim chased him off.

Mr Nabbach took the poster down after the men left, but he has replaced it after comments on Facebook saying the request to take it down was a 'breach of democracy'.

He said: 'The funny thing is, it's not a bad haircut if he styled it correctly.

'Lots of men are walking around with hair shaved short at the back and the sides, long on the top and big beards - in fact it's quite like my own style, though it's all about the face shape.'

Distinctive: North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's hair was declared 'bad' by the Ealing salon, which led to intervention from his agents

His barber son Karim, 26, designed the
 post and said: 'We put up posters for an offer for men's hair cuts 
through the month of April. Obviously in the current news there has been
 this story that North Korean men are only allowed one haircut.

'We
 didn't realise but the North Korean embassy is a 10 minute walk from 
the salon. The next day we had North Korean officials pop into the salon
 asking to speak to the manager.

'The
 men were a bit stern and abrupt, it was all a bit weird. The funny 
thing is, none of them had the Kim Jong-Un hair-cut, they all had normal
 styles.

'Being over here, they have the freedom to wear their hair any way they like, yet they are trying to tell us what to do.'

Customer Helen Bajaj, who has been using the salon for 20 years, was one
 of the people who urged Mr Nabbach to keep the poster up.

She said: 'I posted on the Facebook group about freedom of speech and a friend posted about the freedom to have a laugh.

'I think the poster's cool, it's Mo down to a T. I'm so proud of him for keeping it up.'

A North Korean embassy spokesman said they could not comment on the story.

A Met Police spokesman said: 'We have spoken to all parties involved and no offence has been disclosed'.

While M&M
 Hair Academy consider Kim Jong-un's hair 'bad', the North Korean leader
 is currently forcing all male students in North Korea to get the same 
haircut.

Last month his government announced that the only haircut allowed 
would be the 'Dear Leader' style favoured by Kim Jong-Un. 

His father Kim Jong-il's hair was given extra volume, apparently to make him look taller.

His son's new hair regulation constitutes a clampdown, as previously men had ten styles to choose from. Women had a menu of 18 haircuts to choose from.

In 2005 North Korean state TV launched a five part series entitled 
'Let us trim our hair in accordance with Socialist lifestyle' with the 
aim of promoting neat haircuts.

The
 TV show sent out teams with hidden cameras to catch 'rebels' who were breaking the North Korean strict hairstyle code.
