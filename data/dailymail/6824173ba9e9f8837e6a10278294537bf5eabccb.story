An experimental spaceplane has returned to Earth after a successful mission. 

Esa launched its unmanned Intermediate Experimental Vehicle (IXV) on a Vega rocket from Kourou in South America at 1340 GMT today.

The initial launch was postponed after an unidentified problem with the launch complex.

In total the flight lasted about 100 minutes, and included a daring re-entry into Earth's atmosphere to test new technologies.  

The craft was fired 256 miles (412km) into Earth's atmosphere in the first test flight of technology that could lead to new re-usable spacecraft for use on future missions to Mars.

The launch of an experimental spaceplane took place, after a minor delay due to an unidentified problem with the launch complex. Esa launched its unmanned Intermediate Experimental Vehicle (IXV) on a Vega rocket from South America at 1340 GMT today (still image from live video stream shown)

'IXV has opened a new chapter for Esa in terms of reentry capabilities and reusability,' explained Jean-Jacques Dordain, Esa Director General.

'Esa and its Member States, together with European space industry, are now ready to take up new challenges in several fields of space transportation, in future launchers, robotic exploration or human spaceflight.'

IXV will be launched into a suborbital path by a Vega rocket launched from Europe’s Spaceport in French Guiana in February 11. IXV will separate from Vega at an altitude of 210 miles (340 km). 

IXV will coast to up to 256 miles (412km) and then begin its re-entry phase, recording a vast amount of data from a large number of conventional and advanced sensors.

The entry speed of 4.6 miles per second (7.5 km/s) at an altitude of 75 miles (120 km) will create the same conditions as those for a vehicle returning from low orbit.

IXV will glide through the atmosphere at hypersonic speeds to test new re-entry technologies before parachutes deploy to slow the descent for a splashdown in the Pacific. 

The 16ft (five metres) long spaceplane separated from the Vega rocket at an altitude of 210 miles (340km) above the Earth before climbing to its maximum altitude.

It then flew East for around 20,000 miles (32,000km) during the 100-minute long test flight before re-entering the atmosphere at a rapid 16,800mph (27,000 km/h).

During this time it navigated through the atmosphere using 'flaps' at its back, controlling its re-entry in a way not possible for capsules that return from space.

After passing this test, it then splashed down in the Pacific Ocean as planned around 1525 GMT.

'This mission will teach us a lot about the technologies we need to apply in new launch systems, in particular when we think about reusable systems,' said Gaele Winters, Esa Director of Launchers.

'This was a short mission with big impact,' added Giorgio Tumino, IXV project manager.

'The cutting-edge technology we validated today, and the data gathered from the sensors aboard IXV, will open numerous opportunities for Europe to develop ambitious plans in space transportation for a multitude of applications.'

Engineers at Esa hope to use the craft, which looks like a shrunken space shuttle without wings, to develop new ways of returning cargo and astronauts safely to Earth.

It could also help scientists develop spacecraft that can land safely on the surface of Mars in future missions and then return samples to Earth.

'Re-entry is something we need to achieve if one day we want to have the ambition of having astronauts flying back to Earth with European technologies,' said Mr Tumino.

IXV passed through the atmosphere at hypersonic speeds to test new European re-entry technologies before parachutes deployed to slow the descent for a safe splashdown in the Pacific Ocean.

The Nos Aries recovery vessel will be used to retrieve the spacecraft. Over the last month, the crew have been testing the equipment for hoisting IXV out of the water.

Developed over five years at a cost of 150 million euros (£110 million or $225 million), the IXV is the testbed for a reusable vehicle that may one day be able to land on a conventional runway on Earth after a mission to space.

This could be useful for bringing astronauts back from the International Space Station (ISS).

The only craft currently able to ferry astronauts to the ISS and back is Russia's Soyuz. 

Speaking to the BBC, Mr Tumino said: 'Europe is excellent at going to orbit; we have all the launchers, for example.

'We also have great knowhow in operating complex systems in orbit. But where we are a bit behind is in the knowledge of how to come back from orbit.

'So, if we are to close the circle - go to orbit, stay in orbit, come back from orbit - this third leg we need to master as well as other spacefaring nations.'

Scientists filled the IXV with sensors to monitor how the various materials and flight systems cope during the flight.

After separating from the spacerocket, the IXV was travelling at hypersonic speeds of 9,562mph (15,389km/h).

It  climbed further through the atmosphere before lowering and dipping its nose to begin re-entry.

During the descent, the heat shields designed to protect the spaceplne reached temperatures of up to 1,700 degrees C (3,100 degree F)

Flaps and thrusters helped control the vehicle as it descended, ensuring it came down at a pre-arranged landing site in the Pacific Ocean.

Just before landing a parachute system deployed to allow the two-tonne vehicle to land gently, with airbags deploying to keep it from sinking.

A recovery ship was waiting nearby - around 1,800 miles (2,900km) west of the coast of the Galapagos Islands.

As it made its way through the atmosphere (illustration shown), IXV used 'flaps' at its back to control its re-entry in a way not possible for capsules that return from space, such as Nasa's recent Orion spacecraft. After passing this test, it then splashed down in the Pacific Ocean at the end of the flight

Last year Esa used a prototype of the IXV to practice recovering it from the ocean.

An attempt to launch the IXV last November was postponed by engineers to allow additional analysis of the rockets trajectory to be conducted. 

Last year saw two major setbacks for the space industry.

On October 28, an Orbital Sciences Antares rocket exploded shortly after launch on what was to be a supply mission to the ISS.

This was followed three days later by the crash of Virgin Galactic tourist space plane SpaceShipTwo on a test flight, killing one of two pilots.
