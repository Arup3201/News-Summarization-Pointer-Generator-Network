He has been painted by history as the worst monarch to have ever lorded over the country.

But thanks to a ‘medieval tape recorder’ King John is now been able to make his case from beyond the grave.

The monarch, who ruled from 1199 until 1216, was the first British ruler to keep copies of his correspondence for posterity.

King John, who endorsed the Magna Carta in 1215 is viewed as the worst monarch to have reigned

And these thousands of documents, all written or dictated by the King himself, have allowed his voice to travel through the centuries.

The letters are examined in a new BBC documentary, The Last Journey of the Magna Carta King, and experts claim they call into question the view of John as a tyrannical ruler – although are not able to dispel it completely.

Professor Stephen Church, who co-presents the programme, said: ‘I think they do paint a more human figure. They paint the picture of a man who is energetic, who is enthusiastic, who is an optimist – he really does believe he can move mountains and can make him happen.

‘But they also show the King John we might recognise more easily, a man who is capricious, who you might even think of as vicious sometimes. 

'You get a sense of the threatening John as well as he threatens to confiscate your property and demands you can and see him if you value your life. It gives you a really interesting insight into him.’

Although these documents have been known to exist for a long time, they have been often neglected as a source of historical study and Professor Church believes much more can still be learned from them.

In the BBC 1 documentary 'The Last Journey of the Magna Carta King'  the dramatic last days of King John, famous for the creation of the Magna Carta, are retraced 

Dr Ben Robinson, who also hosts the documentary which broadcasts tonight, described them ‘as close as we get to a medieval tape recording.’

While other monarchs before John were also prolific letter writers, his are the only correspondence to have survived the centuries, as he ordered copies to be made of every letter he ever sent.

Professor Church explained: ‘Most of those letters just disappeared, parchment was pretty valuable stuff, so people often reused it or if not they got rid of it. Although we know John’s brother and father both wrote lots of these letters, we have virtually none that have survived.

‘It’s like your outbox from your email, if you’re not recording what’s going out when you send something then whether it survives or not depends on whether they person you are sending it to keeps it. What’s happening for the first time in John’s reign is that they King has his own sent folder, copies are being kept of the thousands of letters he is sending out.

‘It reveals a huge amount about his personality but one of the most interesting things it shows is that he was a very hands-on king. You can see him not just dealing with the great matters of State – things like treaties and rebellions – but he is also involved in restocking the cellars of the various castles he stayed in as he was travelling around the countryside.’

The documentary, which broadcasts on BBC1 but only in some regions, is part of a series of programmes from the BBC marking the 800th anniversary of the signing of the Magna Carta, which was brought in under King John’s rule.

The show also uses technology called Lidar to reveal, for the first time, how much the landscape of the Fenlands has changed since the days of King John.

The Magna Carta (pictured) is one of the most valuable windows to the past in existence 

The area, in Cambridgeshire, was the backdrop to the monarch’s final journey and, although now intensively farmed, was then a treacherous marshland.

Lidar, which was originally developed by the military, maps the contours and undulations of the Earth in great detail. This data can then be broken down and analysed to reveal how the area looked, stretching back to the Neolithic period.

Dr Robinson said: ‘It’s the first time we’ve seen in this amount of detail all those historic features of the Fenland region. In the past, aerial photographs have revealed a bit of the landscape at a time and you can map them with other bits of aerial photographs. But what the LIDAR does is show in great detail all the stuff as one big picture. That, we just haven’t been able to achieve before.

‘As an archaeologist who loves the Fenland region and knew the important and interest of the place, to suddenly have it depicted this way is incredible. It’s something I couldn’t have dreamt about at the start of my career.

‘Like anything else, the more that people study these images, the more you look at them, the more you see. There are lots of people working on them. The more you study the more you see and the more questions it raises.

‘Essentially, the images are showing you features that date back to the Neolithic and Bronze Age right the way through to King John’s time and then to present day. It’s an incredible window into the past of the region.’

He added that an understanding of the landscape as it once was is vital to comprehending the full picture of historical events. 

He said: ‘When we look at events in history we’ve got to think not just about the documents that people left behind but about the landscapes that they were living in and travelling through because that helps explain some of their actions, their motives and how they viewed the world around them and how they responded to it. 

'We really need to combine the archaeological evidence with the historical documents to work out what it was really like for people at that time to deal with the world around them.

‘The world has changed but what’s most remarkable is that there are still traces of that ancient world for us to see and explore today. They are often subtle and difficult to tease out, which is why Lidar is so important because it gives you that view.

‘The landscape we have today has built up over thousands of years and still has traces of events and actions and activities that took place hundreds of thousands of years ago. That’s the joy of it, you just have to know how to interpret it.

‘But once you do that and once you walk though that ancient landscape you start to empathise a bit more with the characters and personalities that were around at that time. To walk through places King John would have known, virtually walking his footsteps, it was like sharing his last few days with him, it was a very powerful experience. ‘

Royal approval: King John signed with a seal the Magna Carta at Runnymede, near Windsor, in June 1215 – a moment hailed as one of the most significant in English history

King John agreed the Magna Carta at Runnymede, near Windsor, in June 1215 – a moment hailed as one of the most significant in English history.

Meaning 'The Great Charter', it brought an end to the unlimited power of the monarch and established the principle that everybody, including the king, was subject to the law and had the right to fair trial.

It was originally meant as a peace treaty between King John and his barons, with whom he was at war.

The original Magna Carta had 63 clauses. Today, only three of the original 63 clauses remain on the statute books.

Of these three survivors one defends the liberties and rights of the English Church, another confirms the liberties and customs of London and other towns, and the third gives all English subjects the right to justice and a fair trial.

The manuscript has a large influence on the rule of law in Britain today.

It says: 'No free man shall be seized or imprisoned, or stripped of his rights or possessions, or outlawed or exiled, or deprived of his standing in any other way, nor will we proceed with force against him, or send others to do so, except by the lawful judgement of his equals or by the law of the land. To no-one will we sell, to no-one deny or delay right or justice.'

Once sealed by the king, scribes made many copies in medieval Latin, although only four are known to have survived.

The Magna Carta influenced not only Thomas Jefferson when he helped draft the Declaration of Independence, but also the writers of the French constitution and the late South African leader Nelson Mandela, who cited it in his famous speech in his own defence at the Rivonia trial in 1964.
