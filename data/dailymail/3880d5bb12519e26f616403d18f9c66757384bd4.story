Henri Lansbury has penned a new three-year deal at Nottingham Forest after the club put forward fresh terms making him one of their top earners.

Burnley were keen on the central midfielder, who was interested by a move to the Premier League, but he has committed his future to Forest after this week being offered an improved deal from the one on the table since February.

It is understood Burnley contemplated raising the funds for a £4million offer at the eleventh hour on Thursday night, having had a £3.5m bid previously rejected, but ultimately failed to do so.

Going nowhere: Henri Lansbury has penned a new three-year contract at Nottingham Forest

Forest’s excellent start to the season and Stuart Pearce’s words of persuasion were enough to convince Lansbury, one of the Championship's stand-out performers, to sign up.

The 23-year-old had declined to put pen to paper on the contract previously offered by owner Fawaz Al-Hasawi but the deal negotiated this week is a substantial improvement and matches what Burnley could have afforded.

‘His dream will be to play in the Premier League and play international football,’ said Pearce. ‘Maybe he now sees that he is at a football club where he could get that opportunity, without having to move.

‘I am just pleased that players want to commit themselves, for the longer term, to this football club.’

Lansbury is yet to make an appearance this season after picking up an injury in a friendly against Porto B last month. He played in a practice match on Thursday and is expected to return to full fitness soon.
