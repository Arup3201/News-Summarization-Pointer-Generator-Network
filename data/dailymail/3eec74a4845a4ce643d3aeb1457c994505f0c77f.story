DIY chain B&Q has been fined £20,000 after a bathroom display containing a ceramic sink fell on a four-year-old girl.

The girl was with her parents and younger sister at the chain's store in Oldham, Greater Manchester, when she pulled a worktop with a fixed wash basin down on top of her.

She suffered crush injuries and was treated in hospital for cuts and bruises.

Although she was discharged that same the day the unnamed girl had to return for further treatment when she became lethargic and it was noted her ribs were bruised and face swollen. She has since made a full recovery.

The incident in June 2011 was said to have been 'an accident waiting to happen.'

An investigation by health and safety officers found that workmen subcontracted by the retailer had not fixed the display to the wall properly.

And despite the chain's head office sending a warning round to all 359 of its stores about the incident, officials from Oldham Council paid a follow up visit to the store less than a year later and found that nine more items of furniture had not been properly fixed to the walls.

B&Q pleaded guilty to contravening health and safety laws and was fined £15,000 and ordered to pay £5,497 in costs at Oldham magistrates Court.

The incident happened in June 2011, when the mother of the child was talking with a B&Q sales assistant.

The inquiry found that although the sink had been sealed into the work top with silicone the worktop itself had not been secured to the wall with the correct fittings allowing the girl to slide it on top of herself.

Ruth Crimmins, prosecuting, said: 'This was an accident waiting to happen. It just took a four year old girl to pull it away from the wall and on top of her.

'This incident happened six months after the worktop was put into place so not only was it not checked for safety when it was originally installed it hadn't been checked in the six months after.

'B&Q has strict health and safety policies that just weren't implemented at a local level. Staff at the Oldham store failed to implement the systems put in place.'

B&Q said it had since tightened procedures on safety.

Lawyer Jon Cooper, who was representing the retailer in court, said: 'This was not a systemic failure - it was a failure at local level. B&Q regrets the injuries suffered by the girl and we apologise to her. Customer safety is of paramount importance.'

Passing sentence District Judge James Prowse said: 'The girl's injuries could have been a lot worse. This was a serious failing with the potential for causing much more serious harm.'

After the verdict Oldham Councillor Jean Stretton said: 'It is the duty of businesses to protect the health and safety of all customers who visit their premises. If they break the law then we will prosecute.'
