You may be looking forward to tucking into your turkey or unwrapping those long-awaited Christmas gifts, but it seems that Britain's supermarkets are already looking to capitalise on the next major UK religious holiday.

With Easter still a little under 100 days away, supermarket giant Tesco has come under fire - for having its chocolate eggs on sale already.

Shocked shoppers spotted the eggs on sale last week and many took to Twitter to vent their disbelief.

Jumping the gun: Supermarket giant Tesco has come under fire for selling Easter eggs already - with little less than 100 days to go until Easter Sunday

Emma Dockerty posted: 'According to Tesco, its officially Easter! Hello chocolate bunnies!'

While another user, named only as Tres Bien said: 'Tesco are already starting to sell easter stuff? My god why didn't the world end last friday...'

And despite Tesco claiming that the early Easter displays in some stores were a mistake and that they had now been removed until the new year, it seems that some stores may have still be taking deliveries in preparation.

Cashing in: Christmas turkeys may still be flying off the shelves today, but supermarket giant Tesco has already started selling Easter eggs much to the surprise of customers and the annoyance of the Church of England

Mark Brown tweeted: 'Local Tesco just got a delivery of Easter eggs this morning...He's not even born yet and they've him dead & buried already!'

The decision to put the eggs on sale also incurred the wrath of the Church of England who were outraged at Easter goods being on sale in December.

CoE spokesman Steve Jenkins told the Sun: 'Christmas celebrates Jesus’s birth — a different message from Easter, which marks the end of his life.

'Supermarkets should not be selling Easter eggs now.'

Surprised: Twitter user Mark Brown was shocked to see Easter goods being promoted when Christmas is yet to come

Early: Many people took to Twitter to express their surprise at Easter eggs being on sale. Emma Dockerty seemed pleased to see chocolate bunnies on sale

He added: 'Customers think it’s daft — and supermarkets should take what they think into account.'

Tesco are not the only supermarket to jump the gun by selling Easter goods early.

Sainsbury's is already selling Cadbury's Creme Eggs while one Twitter user posted a picture of a range of eggs and chocolate bunnies on sale at a Co-Op store.

Meanwhile, Morrisons plans to stock its shelves with Easter eggs as soon as the Christmas period is over.
