It was hugs all round and a few curtsies too when the Netherlands' King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima arrived in Denmark this morning.

Waiting at Copenhagen's Kastrup Airport was the Scandinavian country's 74-year-old monarch, Queen Margrethe, her husband Prince Henrik, 80 and their son Crown Prince Frederik, 46.

But Maxima, glamorous in a grey coat by Dutch designer Claes Iversen, had serious competition in the style stakes from Australian-born Crown Princess Mary, 43, who was elegant in a nude coat and purple pillbox hat.

Like the 43-year-old Dutch Queen, mother-of-four Mary chose Louboutins for the occasion and even managed to sweep a low curtsey, despite the teetering height of the heels.

Also on hand to welcome the Dutch royals at Kastrup Airport's private royal terminal were other members of the Danish Royal Family, among them Frederik's younger brother Joachim.

45-year-old Joachim's French wife Princess Marie was also there and wore an ensemble that echoed her sister-in-law's.

Queen Margrethe, who along with Queen Elizabeth II, is one of the world's only Queens Regnant, then led the way out of the airport, escorted by King Willem-Alexander.

The Dutch royals are at the start of a three-day state visit to Denmark, aimed at strengthening links between the two countries.

Unsurprisingly, the programme is a busy one, with Maxima and Willem-Alexander set to criss-cross the country over the next couple of days.

Today includes a lunch with Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt, a glamorous blonde who is married to Stephen Kinnock, son of British politician Neil.

Afterwards, the royal couple will travel north to Aalborg in North Jutland where they will attend a conference at the city's university before flying back to Copenhagen for a reception at the Christiansborg Palace.

Tomorrow will see them visit the carbon-neutral Samsø island, accompanied by Crown Prince Frederik and his wife Mary, to visit a special type of Danish boarding school called an efterskole.

Most Danish teenagers spend at least a year at the state boarding schools, where they are encouraged to focus on specific interests such as music.

The efterskole on Samsø focuses on aquatic sports, diving, aviation and golf, with pupils due to give the royal party, among them sport-mad Frederik, a tour of the school.

Frederik and Mary have suffered a bumpy few months, thanks to a film about the Crown Prince's playboy past that is set to be screened later this year.

A second programme, this time being made for Australia's Channel Ten, could also cause some discomfort, thanks to claims that Mary had had second thoughts in the run-up to her 2004 wedding.

By contrast, Queen Maxima and King Willem-Alexander have enjoyed a smooth ride of late, with Maxima in particular becoming increasingly popular.

One of the most glamorous royals in Europe, the Argentina-born mother-of-three has proved a hit with her Dutch subjects, thanks in no small part to her charity work.

She will have plenty of opportunity to do more of that during this week's state visit, with a trip to Bispebjerg Hospital also on their itinerary.
