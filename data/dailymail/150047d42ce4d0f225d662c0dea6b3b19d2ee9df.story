The United States and South Korean took part in their first large river-crossing drill in a decade today.

The exercise comes ten days after the South accused its neighbour North Korea of firing three short-range guided missiles into its eastern waters.

More than 300 U.S. soldiers from 2nd infantry division and 95 South Korean 6th Engineer Brigade soldiers built floating rafts to transport 14 tanks and 16 armored vehicles across the Imjin River in Yeoncheon.

The U.S. and South Korea embarked on their first joint river-crossing exercise for 10 years today in the wake of increasing threats from North Korea

More than 300 soldiers from the 30,000 American troops stationed in South Korea practised the drill with tanks and armored vehicles

North Korea, under the leadership of Kim Jong Un, is said to have fired three missiles at South Korean waters earlier this month

The United States has about 30,000 troops in South Korea to support the country's 650,000-strong armed forces.

North Korea has about 1.2million troops, mostly stationed along the border.

The exercise involved the U.S. Army's M1A2 tank and soldiers from 2nd Battalion, 9th Infantry Regiment of the 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team of 2nd infantry division.

Ten days ago, South Korea's Defence Ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok said the North fired three missiles at the South's eastern waters, though its intent was unclear.

In March, North Korea tested two short-range missiles off its east coast.

U.S. officials said North Korea recently withdrew two mid-range missiles believed to be capable of reaching Guam after moving them to the east coast earlier this year.

Meanwhile, North Korea is still trying to import and export nuclear and ballistic missile-related items but financial and trade sanctions are slowing progress on development of their prohibited weapons, according to a recent UN report.

This joint exercise was the first of its kind for a decade

Key parts of the report provide further information on North Korea's attempts to evade four rounds of increasingly tough UN sanctions aimed at reining in its development of nuclear weapons and the ballistic missiles to deliver them.

While sanctions have not halted these programmes, the panel said, 'it has in all likelihood considerably delayed the (North's) timetable, and through the imposition of financial sanctions and the bans on the trade in weapons, has choked off significant funding which would have been channelled into prohibited activities'.

The report to the UN Security Council committee monitoring sanctions against North Korea recommended imposing sanctions on four additional North Korean companies and 11 individuals.

The council discussed the experts' report on Thursday and it will be up to members to decide whether they are added to the sanctions blacklist.

To increase pressure on Kim Jong Un's regime, the United States and the European Union have gone beyond UN sanctions and imposed even tougher financial measures against North Korea.

China, which is Pyongyang's closest ally and economic lifeline, supported the UN sanctions.

In a sign of growing discontent with the North, the state-run Bank of China, one of the country's largest, halted business earlier this month with a North Korean bank accused by the US of financing Pyongyang's missile and nuclear programs.

The panel said North Korea 'has continued to defy the international community in a series of actions which has heightened concerns about its intentions'.

It cited the North's ballistic missile launch on December 12, its third nuclear test on February 12, and its declaration that it would reactivate nuclear facilities at its Yongbyon nuclear complex.

'The DPRK has continued its efforts to 
import and export items relevant to missile and nuclear programs and 
arms,' the panel said, using the initials of the country's official 
name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

The river crossing exercise was a rehearsal for the joint US and South Korean response to a show of the North's military strength

The report listed North Korean sanctions violations over a five-year period including the seizure of aluminum alloys suspected to be nuclear related in August 2012, and the seizure of missile-related items bound for Syria in May 2012.

Given the North's 'consistent sanctions evasion,' the panel recommended that the country's newly created Ministry of Atomic Energy Industry and its minister, who has not yet been named, be added to the sanctions list.
