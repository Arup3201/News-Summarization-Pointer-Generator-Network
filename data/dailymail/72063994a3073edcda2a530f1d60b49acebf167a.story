A glamorous politician who French First Lady Carla Bruni accused of trying to ‘steal her husband’ has been invited by President Nicolas Sarkozy to join his election campaign team.

The French leader hopes the presence of attractive former justice minister Rachida Dati - who he used to call ‘my little Arab girl’ - will boost his appeal among France’s large immigrant population.

Sarkozy, 56, and Dati, 46, travelled to a campaign rally in Lille this week, where she addressed a crowd dressed in skintight jeans and red stiletto boots.

But the highly provocative gesture is likely to enrage 44-year-old former supermodel Bruni, who once told Dati she was trying to squirm her way into the president’s bed.

Dati - born to Moroccan immigrant parents - was Sarkozy’s deputy campaign spokeswoman in 2007, as then appointed justice minister as part of the president’s ‘ethnically diverse’ cabinet.

But Bruni was widely reported by the French media at the time to believe that Dati had ‘slept her way to the top’.

The First Lady once took her former love rival on a tour of the Elysee Palace, pausing by the presidential bed to hiss: 'You’d have liked to have occupied that bed, wouldn’t you?'

Then in 2009, rumours erupted in French newspapers that Preisdent Sarkozy and Bruni were both having affairs, and Dati was swiftly sacked on suspicion of starting them.

For the past three years she has been a reluctant Euro-MP in Brussels and the mayor of a Paris district.

Her latest invitation to Sarkozy’s campaign top table is also certain to infuriate French prime minister Francois Fillon, as he and Dati are both fighting for the same Paris constituency in June’s parliamentary elections.

French daily Liberation wrote after Dati appeared at Sarkozy’s side at this week’s campaign rally: 'Miracle in Lille! kozy resuscitates Rachida Dati.'

Asked why Sarkozy had invited Dati back, Bruno Jeudi, editor of the respected Journal du Dimanche newspaper, said: 'He may be looking to regain some of the magic of 2007 and Dati was part of that.

'One explanation may be that the president thinks she will help him recast himself as a man of the people.

'The other explanation could be that Sarkozy doesn’t want Dati as an enemy.

'Some say she has damaging information about him dating back to when both worked in the Hauts-de-Seine department.'

Sarkozy’s election policy supremo Emmanuelle Mignon backed Dati’s return to the political front line, adding: 'She has incredibly punch, daring and bravery. She’s a real personality.'

And in an off-the-record chat with French journalists recently, Sarko said he regretted not protecting Dati more three years ago.

He said: 'I believed in her. She has talent.'
