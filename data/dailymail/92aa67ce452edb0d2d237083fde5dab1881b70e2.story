Probation officer Stacey Karen McCarthy, 31, (pictured outside Isleworth Crown Court) has been jailed for a year for protecting her criminal lover

A 'brilliant' probation officer has been jailed after she fell in love with a prolific drug-addict burglar she was supervising - protecting him from police after another break-in and putting him up in her home.

Criminal justice graduate Stacey Karen McCarthy, 31, of Greenford, London, has three degrees, including a Masters - but her promising career has been destroyed as she starts her twelve-month prison sentence.

As she was jailed boyfriend Stephen Sullivan, 35, abused the investigating police officers in the public gallery, tried to head butt two of them and received six weeks imprisonment for contempt of court.

She pleaded guilty to assisting an offender between January 30 and February 23 last year, for failing to notify the police of Sullivan's mobile phone number and allowing him to stay at her home.

She also pleaded guilty to misconduct in public office between January 1 and February 23 last year for conducting an inappropriate relationship with Sullivan while employed as a supervising probation officer and providing him with a mobile phone.

Prosecutor Lyall Thompson told Isleworth Crown Court today McCarthy, who was employed by the London Probation Trust since April, 2008, was Sullivan's supervising officer after his release from prison on licence for a burglary conviction.

'He has a very lengthy conviction history and was a high-risk offender, who had completed five years on the prolific offender scheme.'

Less than three weeks after his release on December 3, 2013 Sullivan broke in at 7.15am on December 28 to a firm that specialises in security alarms and after causing £400 worth of damage was identified by police on CCTV.

He was circulated as wanted on the Police National Computer and as his probation officer McCarthy was asked to assist in locating him.

On January 26, last year McCarthy activated a mobile phone and gave it to Sullivan.

'She deliberately withheld information to the police about the use of this phone and implied that it was being used by her and not Sullivan,' explained Mr. Thompson.

'As a direct consequence police did not use cell-site analysis and an opportunity to locate and arrest him was lost.'

While McCarthy was holidaying in Egypt in February she allowed Sullivan to live in her house and he used her Fiat car.

'This car was used in a burglary in Hertfordshire on February 17 and two associates of Sullivan were arrested.'

Sullivan then ransacked four offices in Canada House, Ruislip, causing a huge amount of damage and taking a laptop.

McCarthy was arrested when she returned from Egypt and was suspended by her bosses and Sullivan was eventually captured by police on April 14.

'When he appeared at Harrow Crown Court on the twentieth of May she talked her way into the cells to visit him, a visit she would not normally have had.'

Sullivan later received two years probation with a drug rehabilitation requirement.

McCarthy was questioned by police on May 28. 'She stated after her arrest she got sucked in by him and a sexual relationship began.'

Matthew Rowcliffe defending said: 'She's always, from a young age, had a desire to understand why others get involved in crime and to steer others away from crime.'

Determined McCarthy beat 'fierce competition' to land her dream job and drove through a new initiative called 'Community Hub' and kept two 'prolific offenders' out of trouble where colleagues had failed.

She supervised 'Prolific Priority Offenders' and knew it was against the rules to have inappropriate relationships with offenders.

'A relationship did develop despite the obvious impropriety and her actions were not carefully calculated, but were impulsive actions from a strong emotional attachment and the relationship continued.'

The fact Sullivan has only failed one drug test while on probation was hailed as another success for McCarthy. 'This reflects the genuine talent Miss McCarthy has to help others change.'

She was forced to resign her position. 'She will never be able to return to that occupation, that vocation,' added Mr Rowcliffe.

'Given her ability and talents this case represents a grave loss to the probation service.'

Judge Aidan Marron QC told her: 'You are clearly a well-educated woman from a good home and with advantages like that this should not have happened.'

Sullivan shouted at officers as they left court: 'You're f***ing scumbags,' and was asked to return by Judge Marron, who ordered his arrest.

'I'm heartbroken, I've lost my girlfriend. Don't ruin all the good work that's been done, this could put me over the edge,' he told the judge before being handcuffed after a struggle and taken to the cells.  

Crack addict Sullivan, who has a two-decade old habit and has spent fourteen of the last nineteen years in custody, was brought back up and admitted contempt of court.

Judge Marron jailed him for six weeks, explaining: 'My usual way of dealing with outbursts is to ignore them, but this I regard as being well over the top.

'It was a nasty explosion - I could see people in the public gallery were upset and you head butted two police officers.'

There will be no further action against Sullivan and the judge added: 'Consider yourself very fortunate indeed.'
