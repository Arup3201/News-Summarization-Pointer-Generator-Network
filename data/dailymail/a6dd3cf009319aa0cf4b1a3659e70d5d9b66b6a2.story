A worker who was helping to repair the fire-ravaged Eastbourne Pier tragically fell to his death yesterday.

Stephen Penrice, 44, of Netherton, Cumbria, was helping to rebuild the structure when he fell through a boardwalk onto the beach.

The pier - the East Sussex town's main tourist attraction - was devastated last month when a huge blaze took hold in its Grade II listed amusement arcade.

It is believed Mr Penrice was working for Cumbria-based contractor MPM North West Ltd when he fell from a rig on the east side of the pier yesterday. 

Emergency services were called shortly after 4pm and an air ambulance landed on the beach. It is believed two off-duty nurses also battled to save the construction worker's life.

An eyewitness said: 'I came along as the police and ambulance were down on the beach next to the pier. I heard that a workman had fallen through the pier.

'I saw them trying to resuscitate him and then a helicopter arrived. It was there for an awfully long time.' 

A spokesman for MPM North West Ltd said: 'It is with great sorrow that we must announce the tragedy which happened at Eastbourne Pier yesterday.

'We are currently liaising with the police and the Health & Safety Executive to investigate this accident.

'Our thoughts and feelings are with the family members and friends who are suffering over this difficult time.'

Sussex Police will be joined by investigators from the Health and Safety Executive today to look into the incident.

On July 30, tourists and locals watched in horror as fire destroyed part of the 144-year-old pier.

At its height, up to 80 firefighters tackled the inferno on the Victorian attraction, which left the dome-shaped amusement arcade near the entrance a scorched shell.

No one was trapped by the blaze and the pier was evacuated quickly without injury or loss of life.

The government has since announced a £2million injection into the town to help boost its economy in the aftermath of the fire.
