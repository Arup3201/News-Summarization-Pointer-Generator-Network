A senior NHS children’s brain doctor exposed as a cocaine user by The Mail on Sunday has been arrested on suspicion of being involved in the supply of Class A drugs.

Inquiries into paediatric neurologist Dr Colin Ferrie began last month after the MoS printed photos taken from a video appearing to show Ferrie snorting cocaine and swallowing the ‘date rape’ drug GHB, just before going on call.

On Wednesday morning, the consultant was arrested at his home near Bradford and taken to Leeds police headquarters for questioning.

Officers also searched his house and his office at Leeds General Infirmary.

Detective Superintendent Pat Twiggs, head of crime for Leeds District, said: ‘A 51-year-old man, from Baildon, was arrested as part of an investigation into potential drugs offences following an article in a national Sunday newspaper about a member of staff at Leeds General Infirmary.

‘He was subsequently released on police bail pending further inquiries.’

Dr Ferrie, 51, is being investigated by the same police team that looked into the drug-taking of former Co-Op Bank chairman Rev Paul Flowers, following our exposure of his secret life in November 2013. 

Inquiries into Ferrie began last month after the Mail on Sunday printed photos taken from a video appearing to show the paediatric neurologist snorting cocaine and taking 'date rape' drug GHB

Flowers was convicted and fined £525 after he admitted possession of cocaine, crystal meth and ketamine.

Leeds Infirmary has suspended Dr Ferrie and the General Medical Council has withdrawn his registration, meaning he cannot practice as a doctor.

Last night Mr Ferrie’s lawyer said: ‘Dr Colin Ferrie is co-operating with the West Yorkshire Police investigation. He has no further comment to make.’
