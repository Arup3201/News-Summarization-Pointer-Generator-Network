A much-loved downtown Houston landmark spectacularly crumbled into a huge cloud of dust when it was imploded on Sunday morning.

The Macy's store on Main Street, which opened as Foley's in 1947, disappeared after a series of loud blasts, leaving nostalgic spectators with just fond memories of a long-gone shopping era.

The 10-story, 791,000-square-foot retail institution was rebranded as Macy's in 2000 and closed in March. Owners of the building plan new retail development for the site.

Waiting: The Macy's building on Main Street has stood in the same place in downtown Houston for 66 years...

Gone: In a matter of seconds and a series of loud blasts the huge building had disappeared forever

Farewell: A much-loved Houston landmark was reduced to rubble on Sunday morning

Authorities closed streets for nine blocks around the blast and neighboring properties boarded up their windows.

Crews
also covered drains in the area to protect water supplies from the huge
amounts of dust thrown up by the implosion at 7.20 am.

The
operation went smoothly, though an unexpected fire caused by asphalt on
the roof of the huge building was quickly dealt with, according to ABC.

But the focus of the event for Houstonians was fondly remembering how the historic store used to be in grander times.

Institution: The huge store opened to 200,000 people 66 years ago and was an instant hit in Houston

The shop opened 66 years ago in front
of a crowd of 200,000 people and was described by Newsweek as 'the most
radical and practical store in America', as reported by ABC.

Foley's was immediately popular and well-known for its festive window displays.

'Oh
my gosh, Christmas, the windows in the front on Main street... 
thousands would come just to see the windows,' Kathy Knott, a former 
Foley’s employee, told KHOU.

'When
the downtown store was founded, it was the first moving escalator in 
the city of Houston, and so everybody rushed downtown to get on the 
escalator,' she added.

End: With a series of loud blasts the 10-story building was reduced to the ground

In demand: The huge store attracted thousands of visitors

On the way: The explosive charges go off around the huge structure and it begins to implode

The city of Houston has changed 
hugely in those decades, growing outwards in a suburban sprawl. Shoppers
now visit malls rather than downtown stores.

Bill Lindstrom, another nostalgic Houston resident, reminisced to ABC when the building shut its doors earlier in the year.

'I
have memories about my mom and sisters coming here, spending an entire 
day on Saturday shopping in the 50s, coming home with a car full of bags
because they'd been at Foley's all day,' he said.

'It's just like sacred being in there. It's kinda like an old church to me. Very special,' Lindstrom added.

Spectacular: The building crumbles into dust

Nostalgia: Older Houstonians remembered the Christmas displays at the store fondly

Rubble: Workers hose down the pile of debris after the implosion
