Whatever one action hero can do, another can do better, it seems.

A month after Jean Claude Van Damme appeared in an astonishing advert doing the splits between two lorries at the age of 53, his Expendables 2 co-star Chuck Norris has pulled no punches in his attempt to outdo him.

Norris - or at least a CGI version - is shown in a spoof online video straddling the wings of two passenger planes with a human Christmas tree of skydivers balanced on his head.

Muscleman merriment: Martial arts star Chuck Norris parodies Jean-Claude Van Damme's epic splits in his Volvo advert in this spoof video wishing everyone a merry Christmas

Citing a passage from Shakespeare's Hamlet, the Walker Texas Ranger says: 'Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, the bird of dawning singeth all night long. So hallow'd and so gracious is the time'

Citing a passage from Shakespeare's 
Hamlet, the Walker Texas Ranger says over an Enya song: 'Wherein our 
Saviour's birth is celebrated, The bird of dawning singeth all night 
long.

'So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.'

He finishes with the message: 'Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.'

The
 video, by Hungarian animation firm Delov Digital, mimics an 
advertisement for Volvo trucks that features 53-year-old Van Damme 
performing the splits between two moving vehicles - although he did it 
for real.

Folding his arms, 
the star balances perfectly with his legs in horizontal position between
 the trucks which are reversing along what appears to be a runway.

The commercial starts with a close-up of the actor talking directly to the camera while standing in a more upright position between the moving vehicles.

'I've had my ups and downs,' he says. 'My fair share of bumpy roads and heavy winds. That's what made me what I am today.

'Now I stand here before you. What you see is a body crafted to perfection.

'A pair of legs engineered to defy the laws of physics and a mindset to master the most epic of splits.'

The video was used to lampoon Toronto's disgraced Mayor Rob Ford (above) who has been torn apart by the media since admitting smoking crack-cocaine amid allegations of using prostitutes and drink-driving

Jean-Claude then perfectly holds his pose as the camera then pans out to show the stunning stunt.

Days
 later, the video was used to lampoon Toronto's disgraced Mayor Rob Ford
 who has been torn apart by the media since admitting smoking 
crack-cocaine amid allegations of using prostitutes, drink-driving and 
sexually harassing a female colleague.

His face was superimposed on Van Damme's body in the spoof by New York-based visual effects firm Artjail.
