Women are used to seeing scary sights in the mirror during a trip to the hairdressers.

But instead of a frightful new hairdo customers were confronted with the face of a ghost during terrifying but hilarious stunt.

The elaborate practical joke had unsuspecting patrons shrieking in terror, with shop staff pretending not to notice the pale and bloodied face of a young girl appearing before them.

The same youngster - who looks as if she has been possessed by an evil demon - then crawls into the shop, upside down on all fours, with her back arched at a painful angle sending everyone fleeing in fear.

Spooked: Another petrified woman shrieks with fear as she falls victim to the beauty salon prank

Pranksters: The ghostly figure is in position, ready to give the customers the fright of their lives

Some customers were so petrified, that they leap from their seats and run out of the store.

The
 stunt was captured on hidden camera to promote the release of The Last 
Exorcism Part 2, a horror film due out in the U.S. next month.

The
 trick involved replacing the standard mirrors inside the salon with 
special two-way mirrors, which the actress then sat behind.

Staff also put a horror film on the television in the store to make the atmosphere a little more tense.

Most of the woman jump when the figure first appears, before questioning themselves and what they have just seen.

Petrified: Customers scream at the sight of the young girl, who appears to be possessed by an evil demon

One customer tries to reassure herself by asking: 'What was that ... maybe it came from the TV?'

Another tries to convince salon 
staff, who are playing dumb, of her ghostly encounter. She says: 'Oh my 
God. That thing just scared me ... the thing in the mirror, the scary 
thing. I know I'm not tripping.'

But when the girl appears again, most
 of the women let out a huge scream, with some jumping from their seats 
and others covering their faces.

Those brave enough to remain in front
 of the mirror are soon running for the exit, however, when the young 
girl appears before them on the shop floor.

Most of the staff cannot resist bursting into laughter on seeing their customers beside themselves with fear.

The video has attracted thousands of 
views online and is similar to a stunt in Brazil, which was also an 
internet hit, last year.

The 15-rated Last Exorcism Part 2 follows Nell 
Sweetzer as she tries to rebuild her life after the frightening events 
featured in the first film, when the evil force that has once possessed 
her returns.

It stars Ashley Bell, Julia Garner, 
Spencer Treat Clark and has been directed by Ed Gass-Donnelly, who also 
co-wrote the screenplay.

The prank involved the lights and power 
turning off in a lift and a ghostly looking young girl climbing inside 
the elevator to give the person trapped in the elevator a fright when 
the lights came back on.

The Last Exorcism Part 2 is released in UK cinemas on June 7, with the first movie grossing nearly $70 million dollars (Â£46m) worldwide.

It also won an Empire award in 2011 for best horror, but its marketing in the UK was not without controversy.

There were 77 complaints made about one of the posters, which showed a young girl, bent over below a crucifix and wearing a dress covered in blood.

The complaints promoted the Advertising Standards Agency to restrict the use of the poster, but did allow it to be used as the back cover of the Cineworld magazine.
