A proposal to charge tourists an entrance fee on arrival to Venice has provoked an outcry in the city which relies on tourism for its survival.

The proposition comes to deter the growing number of people who just go for day trips in order to avoid the cost of a hotel room or restaurant.

Ilaria Borletti, the country's undersecretary of culture, has said that tourists should pay for the privilege of going to the Unesco Word Heritage site.

She said the fee should be paid by all tourists unless they spend the night in Venice, but visitors under 25 would be exempt. The fee would include free entry to one of the city's museums.

On Twitter,  Borletti says: 'Venice does not to have to adapt to tourism, it's tourism that must be adapted to Venice.

'Venice is dying of tourism. The entry ticket, except for overnight stays and under 25's, includes entrance to a museum and proceeds for restoration.'

Venice sees around 25 million visitors a year, with the daily total reaching almost 150,000 in the peak season.

Over 75 per cent of visitors are day trippers who head for St Mark's Square, drift around the romantic canals and block the tiny alleyways, placing a huge strain on the medieval city's fragile infrastructure.

Ms Borletti is the former president of the Italian environment group FAI, a nationwide, non-profit foundation established to safeguard Italy's artistic and natural heritage.

She said the funds raised could be used to finance the city's conservation.

'Venice is slowly dying of tourism, suffocated by summer tourists who eat and run, leaving little or nothing to the city,' Ms Borletti told The Telegraph. 

'For this reason I think we have to protect this city. We should think seriously about the introduction of an entry ticket.'

Large cruise ships have been banned from Venice after fears they were destructing the fragile floating city

It is estimated that tourism to Venice is worth 11billion euros (£9billion) a year, but of all the tourists who visit the city annually, only a quarter stay in a hotel.

Claudio Scarpa, general manager of the Venetian Hotels Association, backed the idea, saying day trippers are a financial burden on the city.

'It is right to find a way to make them pay a kind of entry fee' he says.

The news comes just days after Italy banned large cruise ships from going to Venice amid fears they were destructing the fragile floating city.
