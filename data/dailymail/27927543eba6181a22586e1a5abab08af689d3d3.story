'Predator': Adam Niemira, 27, has been charged with aggravated sexual assault for allegedly raping a woman as she slept in his New Jersey apartment 

A New Jersey man has been arrested for allegedly raping a young woman as she slept in his apartment earlier this month.

Adam Niemira, from Garfield, was taken into custody Wednesday in connection to the alleged sex assault that took place in his apartment a week earlier.

Niemira has been charged with one count of aggravated sexual assault and remanded to Bergen County Jail on $150,000 bail.

The 27-year-old native of Poland also has been ordered not to have any contact with the victim and surrender his passport as a condition of release.

According to the Bergen County Prosecutor’s Office, on August 14, Niemira and the victim spent time together before going to his apartment on Woods Street in Garfield.

The 26-year-old woman woke up later that evening in Niemira’s home to discover the man having intercourse with her, according to a press release from the prosecutor’s office.

Flight risk: The unemployed, single Polish immigrant has been ordered to surrender his passport 

After a brief struggle with Niemira, the woman was able to leave his second-floor apartment and went home.

The victim later reported the alleged rape to police, telling investigators during an interview that she never consented to engaging in any type of sexual activity with the suspect, who was described by prosecutors as single and unemployed..

Niemira is due back in court for his arraignment next Wednesday.
