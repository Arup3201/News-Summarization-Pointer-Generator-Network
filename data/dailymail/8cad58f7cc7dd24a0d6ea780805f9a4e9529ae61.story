She may not be playing a real instrument but footage of a Taiwan dog owner tickling her pet dog in time to a piece of music is proving just as entertaining. 

The clip was posted on Facebook by a university student in Taiwan at the start of the month and has already clocked up more than 2,000 'likes' and shared nearly 20,000 times.

Loving it! Taiwan dog owner tickles her pup in time to music so it looks like a living instrument

The cute dog excitedly kicks its feet to the beat as the girl plays its tummy like a guitar. 

Despite their popularity, the pair have a long way to go before they can compete against double act Ashleigh and Pudsey who stole the nation's hearts with their dance act in 2012 on Britain's Got Talent.

Two years later, Pudsey is now starring in his own film, Pudsey: The Movie, produced by Simon Cowell, with David Walliams providing the voice for Pudsey.

If these two want to hit the big time, they might want to put some more practice in.
