Frustrated holidaymakers faced long delays at airports yesterday on the first full day of increased security checks.

Queues stretched outside the terminal doors at one airport because of the crackdown – brought in amid fears Al Qaeda has developed a ‘stealth bomb’ undetectable to scanners.

Air passengers around the country were subjected to ‘vigorous’ body searches, with their shoes removed and swabbed for traces of explosives. 

Gatwick: Travellers faced delays getting inside the terminal building after the security crackdown 

Queues at Manchester Airport this morning, the day after new security checks were brought in to search for so-called 'stealth bombs' which are feared to be undetectable to airport scanners

Passengers joined queues starting outside Manchester airport today, with many complaining of delays

They were also told to switch on their tablets, smartphones and laptops to prove they are not hiding something more sinister. Some customers said it took them 90 minutes just to get through security – and holidaymakers have now been warned to allow for least three hours before their flight time.

Angry travellers branded the delays an ‘absolute joke’ and ‘like wading through treacle’. Airline chiefs are braced for further problems as one of the busiest weekends of the summer gets underway.

The checks have been brought in due to fears that Al Qaeda’s top bomb-maker Ibrahim Al-Asiri has developed a non-metallic ‘stealth bomb’ that can be hidden inside human bodies or other devices.

The use of body scanners, swabs and patting down have all been increased at UK airports while some bags are being searched twice.

Passengers are removing shoes and belts as a matter of course, while those on US-bound flights are likely to face further screening and searches of bags at the boarding gates.

The alert has sparked fears of a summer of travel chaos with holidaymakers facing invasive personal checks and long delays.

Heathrow alone handles more than 190,000 passengers a day and across the country 24million people will fly abroad before September – 3million to the US.

A spokesman for travel industry body ABTA said: ‘The main thing is to make sure that airports have sufficient measures in place to ensure all the available security gates are open.’ 

At Manchester Airport, officials said problems were made worse by many travellers arriving earlier than normal because of the extra checks. Some complained they were left standing outside the terminal building before they could even check in.

Sam Lavelle posted pictures of fellow passengers queuing in the drop-off zone outside Terminal One, writing: ‘The queue is literally outside the door and onto the road.’ Elissa Corrigan described the wait as ‘soul destroying’.

And Ian Moreno-Melgar, who was heading to Belfast for a wedding, tweeted: ‘Queuing in the car park for security isn’t normal.’

But at Heathrow passengers appeared resigned to longer and more intrusive searches as they were subjected to what one termed ‘American-style security’.

Christian Radnedge, who was flying to Houston, said: ‘Everyone is taking their shoes off, there are pat-downs on almost everyone after being screened, a few people are having their bags tested.’

A traveller flying to California said it was a price worth paying for ‘staying safe in a dangerous world’. And Paul Kenyon, 59, of Poynton, Cheshire, who was on his way to Bologna, said: ‘They were looking at Apple computer equipment closely and they took my washbag through the machine a couple of times as I had my contact lenses in liquid inside.

‘Nobody was moaning about the extra time and it’s not that much of a hassle. As long as you leave yourself plenty of time then you’ll get on your flight.’ Last night, traveller Matteo Pescarin posted a photo of a crammed North Terminal at Gatwick Airport as hundreds of passengers queued to go through security.

Taking the chaos with good humour, David Silvester tweeted: ‘Just had my croissants x-rayed and then inspected...’

At Glasgow Airport, passengers also faced waits. Norma Decent, 59, from Stranraer, said: ‘I understand why they’re doing it, but it all seems a little excessive to me.’

Laura Macpherson, 42, from Paisley, added: ‘It’s better to be safe than sorry.’

Don't go to Syria, imams urge young Britons 

Muslim leaders yesterday launched an unprecedented appeal to would-be young British jihadists: Don’t travel to fight in Syria and Iraq.

Some 100 imams asked the UK’s Muslim community to help prevent radicalised youngsters joining militants abroad.

Muslims should continue the ‘generous and tireless’ support for those caught up in the bloodshed – but from the UK in a ‘safe and responsible way’, they said.

Chilling: British jihadists in a recruitment video aimed at youngsters in the UK 

The call was made by leaders from different Islamic theological backgrounds and was echoed by imams during Friday prayers. It came as claims emerged yesterday that up to three Al Qaeda instructors tutored by master bomb-maker Ibrahim Al-Asiri are believed to have slipped in to Syria to teach British and other Europeans jihadists to make ‘stealth bombs’.

And a British man who claims he has been fighting in Syria told the BBC he will not return to the UK until he can raise ‘the black flag of Islam’ over Downing Street and Buckingham Palace.

Speaking with a northern accent, the man, who called himself Abu Osama, said he had received military training, making bombs and fighting with the extremist Al-Nusra Front, linked to Al Qaeda.

He claimed to have been fighting for the establishment of a caliphate – which he referred to by the Arabic term Khilafah – across the Islamic world. ‘There is nothing in Britain – it is just pure evil,’ he said.

‘If and when I come back to Britain it will be when this Khilafah – this Islamic state – comes to conquer Britain and I come to raise the black flag of Islam over Downing Street, over Buckingham Palace, over Tower Bridge and over Big Ben. I don’t want to come back to what I have left behind.’ 

Osama said he initially faced opposition from his family but they now ‘understand that this is a good cause I am in’.

It emerged yesterday that there are already believed to be three Al Qaeda instructors trained in bomb-making in Syria. It is feared they are poised to tutor young British Muslims who have travelled there in the art of making ‘invisible bombs’ – non-metallic devices that can get past airport scanners and can even be stitched inside a suicide bomber’s body.

Security officers are said to have identified more than 100 of the 600 Britons currently fighting in Syria while US investigators have given their UK counterparts ‘dozens of names of interest’.

However the US, which has demanded increased security at British airports, also accused the UK of ignoring for too long the threat posed by men like Osama.

Frank Gaffney, former assistant secretary of defence under Ronald Reagan, said British governments ‘turned a blind eye’ to recruitment operations and ‘embraced extremists’. He said of the Western jihadists in Iraq and Syria: ‘What they learn there are the skill sets to bring violence to us.’
