Two San Francisco officers say they had to use lethal force against a woman who they shot and killed as she was recklessly driving in what may have been a stolen car.

The officers were conducting a stolen-vehicle investigation at a Chevron gas station on Tuesday evening when they approached a 20 to 30 year-old woman in a black Volkswagen.

When officers flashed their badges, the woman whose identity has not yet been released, fled.

The scene: This is the scene on Pine and Van Ness streets after a woman in San Francisco was shot dead by police because she was recklessly driving in what may have been a stolen car 

She allegedly made a U-turn against traffic, struck several cars on the road, drove onto the sidewalk, and almost hit and killed a motorcyclist, reports SF GATE.

'She's crashing into every car. I'm going to have to take lethal force,' said an officer in a frantic call to the dispatcher.

Deputy Chief Hector Sainez said that the two officers 'fearing for their safety,' fired two shots at the female driver at Pine and Van Ness streets and the car eventually stopped moving.

Officers ordered medical aid for the woman but she died on the scene of her injuries.

'She was crazy,' on witness told ABC.

The woman's vehicle: The possibly stolen black Volkswagen was towed after the shooting on Tuesday evening 

Witness: 'She was crazy,' said this witness of the female driver who was shot on Tuesday night 

Witness Laurel Timms McNally told SF Gate that she was pumping gas into her van at the Chevron when she heard the sound of a car hitting something.

She said she saw the crazed woman speed past her along with an unmarked police car.

She says she heard gun shots and the car turning back around.

'I just started freaking out,' she said. 'I hit the floor in my van.'

Witness Leo Tikhomirov, 42, told The San Francisco Examiner that he saw people running down the street in fear.

'We saw around 30 people running on the street,' Tikhomirov said.

The origin of the stolen vehicle report was not known and the case remains under investigation. 

The shooting will be investigated by the District Attorney's Office and the department.
