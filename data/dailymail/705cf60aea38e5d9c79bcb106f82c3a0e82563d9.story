These spectacular pictures of Niagara Falls show its natural beauty lit up with brilliant neon lights.

The cascading curtain of water looks particularly magical at night, with the spray glowing bright pink, blue and yellow against the dark sky as it crashes into the river below.

Photographer Rajeev Nair, from Connecticut, US, captured the extraordinary pictures of the annual light show by spending hours at the world famous landmark.

Rainbow at night: The famous waterfalls that straddle Canada and the US emit a remarkable glow in the ethereal pictures

Pink passion: The vibrant colours make the water look like silk and the spray like clouds of light

Electric dreams: Photographer Rajeev Nair waited for his moment to capture the majesty of the famous tourist attraction turning turquoise

Purple haze: The natural wonder of the waterfall is emphasised by the astonishing display

He said: 'I have always dreamt of taking such photos - I have a special interest in waterfalls and seascapes and Niagara Falls provided me with a great opportunity to fulfil my interests.

'I think the Niagara light show is one of the most beautiful attractions and I was determined to capture it in my lifetime.'

Mr Nair, 34, waited patiently each night for the right moment to get the perfect images of the illuminations, biding his time until an hour after sunset to photograph the beautiful blue hour.

He said: 'Taking the pictures at this time helped to create the silky effect of the falls due to the long exposure.

Golden memories: The lights look like sunbeams despite the late hour as the droplets spring into the night air

Spice of life: The foremost of Niagara's three waterfalls is almost obscured with pink, while another can be seen shining in yellow in the background

Phenomenal power: More than six million cubic feet of water falls over the crest every minute in high flow

'This way you can also capture all the details of the light falling on the Niagara Falls.

'After taking a couple of photos, I started to get the desired effect and composition. Then it was just a matter of taking pictures at each change in the colour.'

Mr Nair, who works as a financial reporter, used a Canon Rebel T2i camera and an 18-55mm kit lens to achieve the remarkable shots taken from beside the American Falls - one of the three waterfalls that make up Niagara.

The magnificent illumination of the falls has been organised by local authorities since 1925. It is constantly changing, as each of of the falls glows in a rainbow of colours to complete the vast, awe-inspiring sight.

More than six million cubic feet (168,000 m3) of water falls over the crest every minute in high flow, straddling the border of the Canadian province of Ontario and the US state of New York.
