Arsene Wenger's side were in good spirits at their training base in St Albans ahead of their crunch meeting with Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday. 

Both sides have struggled to impress in the Premier League this campaign with Arsenal currently sitting in seventh position in the table while Brendan Rodgers' side occupy 12th place with a current tally of 21 points. 

The Gunners trio Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott will all face fitness tests before the Anfield clash.

Liverpool, meanwhile, have plenty of their own problems with centre back Dejan Lovren a doubt with a groin injury while Daniel Sturridge and Glen Johnson are still out of action. 

A fascinating contest awaits in Merseyside.
