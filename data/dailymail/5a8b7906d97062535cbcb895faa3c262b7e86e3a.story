President Obama was back on the golf course today as he enjoyed yet another 18 holes amid deepening concerns about the spreading terrorist rampage of extremist group ISIS.

The President played a round with former NBA basketball star Alonzo Mourning and Cyrus Walker, cousin of White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, at Farm Neck Golf Club, in Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts on Saturday.

His hours on the golf course during a two-week break on the resort island of Martha's Vineyard have his detractors teeing up as they highlight the slew of foreign policy crises currently facing the U.S.

On Friday, the FBI and Homeland Security warned police forces across the country to be on the lookout for terrorist threats as a chilling note was posted online warning that Chicago could be an ISIS target.

The federal agencies sent a bulletin on Friday to law enforcement agencies warning them to be on the lookout for terrorism. Although no specific threats have been identified, they could not guarantee no future attacks, the federal agencies said.

Chicago in particular has become a prime target because extremist groups think of it as 'Obama Town', a security expert told CBS.

A tweet, posted on June 20, has been discovered, showing pictures of the Old Republic Building in Chicago and the White House with a message reportedly from the Islamic State (ISIS or ISIL).

The note read: 'We are in your state/We are in your cities/We are in your streets/You are our goals anywhere.'

The brutal capabilities of ISIS were revealed on Tuesday after a stomach-churning video released showed the beheading of American photojournalist James Foley at the hands of a hooded militant.

In the aftermath of Mr Foley's beheading, the President is weighing up how to increase his military campaign against ISIS as the US edges closer to strikes in Syria.

Having already conducted limited air-strikes against ISIS positions in northern Iraq to aid Kurdish fighters for humanitarian reasons, the White House is examining its legal options to launch raids across the border to hit the terror groups stronghold.

Preferably Congress would pass a resolution to provide the domestic legal justification for attacks against the Sunni Muslim group that now operates its Islamic State that ranges nearly from Baghdad to Damascus.

Under discussion by the administration is to invoke the War Powers Resolution which constitutionally allows emergency military actions to protect US citizens, but would need an extension granted by Congress.

The president authorized the current strikes in Iraq under that, which is legally sound for 60 days, but expires in early October.

However, if the president wants to increase his military involvement into Syria he is expected to seek the approval of a Congress already uneasy about the limits of presidential authority to make war.

An official with the White House has not ruled out immediate air strikes in Syria against ISIS according to the Washington Post under the guise of protecting US citizens. 

The growing number of foreign policy dilemmas has the president's aides confronting a question it faces whenever Obama gets away: Is there ever a good time for the commander in chief to take a few days off?

The White House suggested on Friday that Obama was trying to work out his tensions when he played 18 holes of golf on Wednesday – complete with grins and fist-bumps – immediately after delivering a brief but moving speech condemning the gruesome execution of Mr Foley.

And adding to the week of optics problems, Secretary of State John Kerry was spotted sailing off the island of Nantucket while the Pentagon and White House answered tough questions about the Middle East.

Obama doubles over with laughter during his relaxing two-week holiday in the exclusive president's playground of Martha's Vineyard

Obama was golfing with two friends on Saturday days after being criticized for hitting the green minutes after making a speech regarding the ISIS beheading of journalist James Foley

'Sports and leisure activities are a good way for release and clearing of the mind for a lot of us,' Deputy White House Press Secretary Eric Schultz told reporters in a makeshift briefing room on Martha's Vineyard, where Obama is on a two-week vacation.

But 'I am not going to get into the president's mindset on that,' he added.

The president drew fire earlier this week after reacting for just five minutes to Foley's on-camera slaying by Islamist militants linked to the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS), and then gripping his driver for five hours.  

Less than ten minutes before teeing off, he had told a global audience that 'when people harm Americans, anywhere, we do what’s necessary to see that justice is done.'

Then he was seen laughing with friends at the Farm Neck Golf Club. A day later he played golf again, although photographs taken Thursday depicted a more somber commander-in-chief recreating.

Schultz acknowledged Friday the poor 'optics' of playing golf while a decapitated journalist's family mourned, but insisted that 'the president is focused on doing his job,' even while on vacation.

'Just because the president is in a different location doesn't mean he's not doing his job,' Schultz insisted, assuring reporters that domestic and international events have 'absolutely captured the president's attention while we've been here.'

Donald Trump, the ubiquitous real estate mogul and golf course owner, told MailOnline that the White House should be taking advantage of Obama's golf outings as a chance to build compromises with Republicans.

Golf 'is a perfect game to make friends and negotiate deals over,' he said Friday.

But 'the only people Obama should be playing golf with are congressmen – legislators – and especially the opposition.'

'Obama should not be playing golf on the first day of bombings or after an American journalist is beheaded.'

A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told MailOnline that to his knowledge, the senior Republican lawmaker had never been invited to play a round with the president.

Kerry hasn't been seen in Washington all week, and reporters have been unable to get an answer from the State Department about his location.

But Instagram user Judy Durkin posted a photo of a sailboat on Monday that bears the same markings as Kerry's, cruising neat Nantucket – just a few miles from where Obama has been vacationing.

Others tweeted Kerry sightings there as recently as Thursday.

The Republican National Committee, predictably, was not amused.

'The Obama White House is MIA on the world stage,' RNC Deputy Press Secretary Raffi Williams told MailOnline. 'America’s influence around the world has been waning ever since Obama took office and now that the world is erupting in crises our top diplomat is sailing in Nantucket.'

'Americans want hands on leadership that tackles the tough problems head on. The out of touch leadership seen from Obama and Kerry is going to hurt 2014 Democrats.'

The State Department released a statement in Kerry's name on Wednesday, after the Foley video had made most of America cringe.

'We grieve for James Foley. We mourn for his family and his loved ones,' the statement read. 'We honor the courage and pray for the safety of all those who risk their lives to discover the truth where it is needed most.'

'And make no mistake: we will continue to confront ISI[S] wherever it tries to spread its despicable hatred. The world must know that the United States of America will never back down in the face of such evil.'

Criticism of the president after he marked his scorecard Wednesday was fast and furious.

'Not only did he insult the Foley family; he sent a message to [ISIS leader] Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and all of the other jihadi terrorist militants – now soldiers of a jihadi army – that he doesn't take it all seriously.'

Texas Republican Congressman Louie Gohmert told Mailonline that Obama's detached attitude suggests he hasn't been engaged in the hunt for Foley's murderer.

'Unfortunately for those who want evil ISIS members eliminated before they kill more Americans,' Gohmert said, 'the president spent more time lining up his many putts than he did lining up efforts to stop the killers.'

Lou Barletta, a Republican lawmaker from Pennsylvania, told MailOnline that the image of Obama golfing his cares away 'is disheartening, and sends the wrong signals to our enemies. ISIS needs to be stopped, and fist pumps between the president and his buddies won’t stop them.'

Former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney told Fox News host Sean Hannity that 'every day we find new evidence that he’d rather be on the golf course than he would be dealing with a crisis that’s developing rapidly in the Middle East.'

ABC News political director Rick Klein added that 'the president himself clearly doesn't ... care about the way it looks.'
