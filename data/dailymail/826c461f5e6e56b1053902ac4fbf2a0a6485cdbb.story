Lou Teasdale has a job that many teenagers would covet working as One Direction's personal hair and make-up artist.

FEMAIL were keen to hear her beauty secrets and got the chance as she celebrated the launch of her DIY hair and beauty bible, The Craft, this week, with a little help from Harry Styles, Ed Sheeran and Liam Payne.

The beauty guru revealed what trends are going to be big news this season, how you can pull them off and get the look for less at home.

Her book features step-by-step make-up and hair tutorials that are edgy, stylish and fun. From fancy fishtailing, twisting, or dip-dying your hair to creating the perfect foundation base or smokey eye, Lou has it covered.

If that all sounds a bit too much, then be bold - Lou said this season is all about taking your beauty regime one step further: think bright colours, hair chalk and glitzy brows.

Those of you who were too afraid to experiment with rainbow hair will be pleased to know that the more muted 'drainbow' hair is the hottest style for summer.

Speaking about the trend, Lou said: 'Those cool people who live in East London were first on the scene with neon/lumo/vunge green/pink hair last year.

Hot new hair trend: Lou predicts that the 'drainbow' look, where dye has begun to wash out, is going to be huge this season

Go bold or go home! Bright colours will be adorning nails, lips and even eyebrows, so will brow queen Cara Delevingne been trialling the trend?

'And when the dye started to wash out, they accidentally created a whole new look: drainbow.

'It's a much more wearable colour trend that's great for girls who don't want to go too crazy with their pretty hair.'

If drainbow is too adventurous, Lou suggests accessorising and takes a 'more is more' stance.

'Just when you think you've added enough, keep going! Be creative when sourcing your bobbles, clips, beads and slides. Children's toy shops have some great trinkets and all kids' clothes shops have good accessories sections.'

Thanks to the likes of Prince Harry's girlfriend Cressida Bonas, scrunchies are back in fashion - Lou says the best way to pull off the look is with a scrunchie topknot.

Accessorise all areas: For those not daring enough for hair dye, try some beads, which you can pick up from children's stores

Last season saw Cara Delevingne put big brows on the beauty map, but now it's all about embellishing them with glitter and bright hues. Enter the browscara.

'All the cool kids are doing browscara,' explained Lou. 'What does it remind me of? Oh wait, remember hair mascara? That!

'Even if you're mega blonde you'll still look cooler with dark eyebrows. Trust me. You don't even need to faff around with dye. Once you've done your lashes, simply brush some mascara into your brows and done.'

As for lashes, while most girls try their hardest to avoid spider eyes, Lou says that's the exact look we should now be striving to achieve.

'Forget limp daddy-long-legs lashes. We're layering our mascara ten times because we want tarantula legs! You don't need false lashes for this look, just clump it up and lump it on with Max Factor's 2000 calorie mascara,' she said.

Lou is the global brand ambassador for Fudge Urban - a collection of fun, edgy and alternative unisex hair styling products inspired by fashion, culture, music and all things creative.

At her launch this week, Lou's hair stylists were testing out the season's trends and were on hand to offer chalked hair, while HD Brows gave guests glitzy brow-overs.

Lou, 31,
 trained at London College of Fashion and assisted for five years without a pay cheque to her name.

She worked on hair counters at shopping centers and assisted hairstylists before getting her big break on X Factor and Britain's Got Talent, where she worked for five years.

She now travels the world with the One Direction boys and has amassed 1.4m Twitter followers thanks to her candid beauty tips and fun photofeed - Harry Styles is partial to a few selfies with Lou and her baby daughter.

Will he be sporting drainbow hair anytime soon? Most probably, if Lou has anything to do with it.
