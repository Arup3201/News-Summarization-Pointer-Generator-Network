A serial rapist in Russia suspected of committing more than 100 rapes in his lifetime has told police he treated himself to women for his birthday.

Valery Makarenkov, 67, was caught last month after a reign of terror in Moscow which lasted nearly 30 years.

Wearing a mask to hide his identity, he would strangle his victims until they lost consciousness before raping them and stealing their money and valuables.

Now Makarenkov has told officers investigating his horrific crimes: 'I gave myself these girls as a birthday gift.'

Valery Makarenkov, 67, who is thought to be behind at least 108 rapes in Moscow over 27 years, has told police he 'gave myself these girls as a birthday gift'

Despite Makarenkov using the same technique for all his crimes, and them all happening around his birthday on May 27, police were unable to track him down until now

Despite using the same modus operandi,
 and the fact that all the attacks took place in the two months around 
his birthday on May 27, local police never got on the trail of the 
serial rapist.

Makarenkov
 was only caught after attacking a 29-year-old woman who was able to 
fight him off and lift his mask in order to look at his face.

After escaping the attack, the woman 
alerted police nearby who tracked him down and arrested him, after the 
woman later identified him.

'Old age finally caught up with him and he was unable to complete the act, as his victim was able to beat him off,' said a police spokesman.

The first reported incident was during the years of Communism but the victim is only now set to find closure.

The exact number victims is still not known, but it is believed he has raped at least 108 women during the last 27 years.

When the husbands, fathers and brothers of the women whose lives were changed forever, found out that the criminal was caught, they gathered outside the courthouse where he was detained.Â 

According to police , the crimes were not planned. Makarenkov acted spontaneously, depending on the situation.

He had no preference in the age or the social status of the women - he only cared that they would not be able to resist.

Investigators were able to 
establish the involvement of Makarenkov in numerous crimes, some of them
 through DNA. The most recent victims were also able to identify him.

In
 the years leading to Makarenkov's arrest, detectives studied 
some of the suspect's handwriting and compiled a list of around 20,000
 Moscow residents who bore resemblence to the suspect's description.

'After
 several years of hard analytical work, Valery Makarenkov, who was born 
in 1947, was detained,' Vladimir Markin, a spokesman for Russia's 
Investigative Committee, said.

'According
 to investigators, in the period from 1987 to 2014, he carried out a 
series of attacks on women in Moscow that were associated with 
robberies.'

Police say Makarenkov didn't targeted women who would be easy to subdue, acting spontaneously

Investigators say many of the attacks followed a specific 'modus operandi' in which Makarenkov would pose as an ordinary cyclist late at night or early in the morning.

He would follow his victims in Moscow parks or in the backyards of apartment buildings, where he would choke the women unconscious and rape them before stealing any valuable possessions they were carrying.

'Thanks to the modern high-tech equipment of the Russian Investigative Committee's Main Criminalistics Department, a rapid molecular-genetic study of the suspect's DNA samples allowed investigators to quickly establish his involvement in 19 crimes,' Markin explained.

'The young woman who was attacked three days earlier confidently identified the suspect.'
