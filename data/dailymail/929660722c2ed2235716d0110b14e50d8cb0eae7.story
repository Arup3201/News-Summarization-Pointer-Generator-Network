A debut novelist whose work was rejected by publishers for a decade has won one of the world's top literary awards.

Irish author Eimear McBride, 37, beat heavyweights including American Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Donna Tartt to win the £30,000 Women's Prize for Fiction at a ceremony in central London.

Her novel 'A Girl Is A Half-Formed Thing' was written 10 years ago but was rejected as too experimental by every publisher who read it, until a small company in McBride's hometown of Norwich finally agreed to release it last year.

The novel, which is the story of a young woman's relationship with her brother and the long shadow cast by his childhood brain tumour, was written in just six months in 2004.

After being rejected by every publisher she sent it to, McBride decided to put the novel away until last year when Norwich-based independent publisher Gallery Beggar Press agreed it must be published.

The company paid McBride a £600 advance for what was only the second book it had ever released, with 'A Girl Is A Half-Formed Thing' later picked up by Faber & Faber, who gave it a wider audience.

The book has been critically acclaimed since its release, winning the inaugural Goldsmiths Prize last year and narrowly losing out on the The Folio Prize in March to American writer George Saunders.

Speaking yesterday, Helen Fraser, who chaired the Women's Prize for Fiction judging panel, said: 'An amazing and ambitious first novel that
 impressed the judges with its inventiveness and energy. This is an 
extraordinary new voice - this novel will move and astonish the reader.'

Ms McBride, who was born in Liverpool but grew up Sligo and Mayo in Ireland, collected her prize at an awards ceremony at the Royal Festival Hall in London.

She beat a number of acclaimed authors including a previous winner, Nigerian novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, who was nominated for 'Americanah'.

Jonathan Ruppin, web editor for Foyles bookshop, said: 'To paraphrase Brian Eno's legendary quote about the first Velvet Underground album, not many people have bought it so far but every single one of them will probably write a novel.'

'It's bold, brilliant and beautiful, a book that will delight every reader concerned that the novel had nowhere new to go and reinforce every prejudice of those who dismiss literary fiction as pretentious.'

Previous winners of the prize, formerly sponsored by communications company Orange, include Zadie Smith's On Beauty and Lionel Shriver's We Need to Talk About Kevin.
