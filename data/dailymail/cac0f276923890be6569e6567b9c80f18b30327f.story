Remarkable: Glen Campbell pictured here in 2012 during the farewell tour

The country music legend known as as the rhinestone cowboy Glen Campbell was honored recently as his children performed following a screening of an upcoming documentary about his farewell tour.

The 78-year-old star bravely performed his final 100-plus shows after receiving a devastating Alzheimer's diagnosis in 2011.

The documentary, called Glen Campbell: I'll Be Me, reveals the performer--who is now in full-time care--was miraculously able to play guitar and sing perfectly despite his illness, though he at times appeared confused on-stage.

Campbell's Alzheimer's disease has 
progressed to the point where he needs full-time professional care, his 
wife said in June, explaining her decision to place the singer in a 
long-term care facility and responding publicly for the first time to 
criticism from Campbell's eldest daughter.

The news madeCampbell's final tour and the brave face he keeps in the James Keach-directed documentary all the more remarkable.

In
 an email to The Associated Press, Kim Campbell wrote that doctors 
persuaded her earlier this spring to discontinue care at the family's 
home, drawing criticism from Campbell's daughter Debby.

'It is crushingly sad to see him afflicted with Alzheimer's but indulging those feelings does not help him,' Campbell wrote, adding, 'I am his wife and no one wants him home more than me but I must do what is in his best interest.'

Meanwhile, at the recent screening, the Campbell family including daughter Ashley and son Shannon--who performed for the likes of Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey--put on their own brave faces during the screening and after party, according to the Boston Globe.

Debby Campbell told Country Weekly magazine last week that she objected to the move and that she and Campbell's eldest children heard about it through news media reports. She also said she did not believe family members in Nashville, where the Country Music Hall of Fame member now lives, were spending enough time with him.

Campbell was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2011. He issued two albums and went on a world tour following the diagnosis. At the time, Kim Campbell said the tour was a way to help her husband combat the brain-ravaging disease and spend time with his family members, including Debby, who made up his band and traveled with him.

Glen Campbell has eight children, including three with Kim Campbell, his wife of 32 years. She says she spends time with her husband every day and that two of his children who live in Nashville visit weekly. Beyond that, she says she organizes activities for the Grammy Award-winning singer of such hits as 'Rhinestone Cowboy' and 'Wichita Lineman.'

'He has longtime friends here in Nashville who come to play music for him and give him hugs,' Kim Campbell said. 'He has activities and therapies to stimulate him and help him experience daily moments of success. His life is filled with love and laughter and he is being cared for round the clock by people who specialize in Alzheimer's care and happen to adore him.'Â
