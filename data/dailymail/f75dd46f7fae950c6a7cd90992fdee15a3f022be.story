Pressure: Ed Miliband is under pressure to re-open his investigation into alleged vote-rigging

Ed Miliband is under pressure to re-open his investigation into alleged vote-rigging after a cache of emails appeared to implicate Unite in thwarting the original inquiry.

Around 1,000 emails handed over to police allegedly show union bosses conspiring to subvert the Labour Party investigation into the selection of its parliamentary candidate in Falkirk.

Last night there were renewed calls – including one from Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont – to re-open the inquiry.

Conservative MP Henry Smith has also written to police asking them to re-open their own investigation into the affair.

The emails include messages from Stevie Deans, chairman of the Falkirk Labour Party, who is also a Unite boss at the Grangemouth oil refinery.

Mr Deans was at the centre of the Grangemouth closure last week after Unite threatened strike action over his suspension from the firm.

Employers Ineos suspected Mr Deans of spending company time on party business rather than industrial relations.

The emails, published in the  Sunday Times, will embarrass Mr Miliband, who cleared Mr Deans of wrongdoing and reinstated him to the party in the autumn.

Mr Miliband dropped the inquiry after four witnesses, members of a local family called Kane, withdrew their claims of vote-rigging.

But the emails revealed that Mr 
Deans himself had approved their retractions, which were drawn up by 
lawyers acting on behalf of Unite.

One
 email sent by Howard Beckett, a Unite executive, said that the union 
should draw up ‘statements on behalf of the Kanes rebutting allegations 
in the report as to what they are alleged to have said’.

Mr Deans wrote back that he was ‘happy’ with the draft adding: ‘Get this to the Kane family and get this posted tonight’. Unite has denied having any ‘inappropriate’ contact with witnesses and said it dealt with them through ‘external solicitors’.

Another email also reveals a plot to try to drag former prime minister Gordon Brown into the affair by getting him to lobby Mr Miliband to drop his argument with Unite.

Dispute: His suspension had previously triggered a dramatic stand-off, culminating in the shock closure of the petrochemical plant (pictured). This was only reversed at the 11th hour after the union backed down

Mr Beckett wrote: ‘We will prepare 
for an approach to Gordon Brown wherein we ask Gordon to consider the 
potential damage this could do and request GB do contact Ed M in 
private.’

One email also appears to threaten 
to launch a smear campaign, with an official saying: ‘Comms [the PR 
team] will prepare the nasty stuff we know of individuals in the Labour 
Party but this will not be used.’

Mr Miliband ordered an investigation into the selection process this summer following claims Unite had tried to pack the Falkirk West constituency with its own members to get Karie Murphy selected.

Mr Miliband last night signalled he could re-open the investigation.

A spokesman said: ‘Ed thinks if there is any new evidence, then he will be happy to examine it.’

The spokesman added that throughout Mr Miliband had acted swiftly to launch his initial inquiry.

Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont said: ‘If there is any new details that are as grave as is being suggested then of course there should be a new investigation.’ 

Henry Smith, Tory MP for Crawley, also wrote to police formally urging them to re-open their investigation over ‘potentially fraudulent behaviour’ by Unite.

Tory Party chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘Labour must re-open the Falkirk inquiry. Ed Miliband failed to stand up to the unions in Falkirk and backed down in the face of pressure from [Unite general  secretary] Len McCluskey.’

The local MP Eric Joyce, who is standing down at the next election following a drunken Commons brawl, joined calls for a new probe.

He said: ‘Labour must re-open inquiry into Falkirk immediately. Local Labour members are outraged that Deans remains Falkirk West CLP [chairman].’ 

Unite said the claims against it over the selection process had been ‘entirely unjustified’ and neither the law nor the party rules had been broken -  claiming 'the email exchanges do nothing to change that'.
