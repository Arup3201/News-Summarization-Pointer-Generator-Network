All 17 of the Nomads bikie gang who had got together at their regular 'church meeting' have been arrested in a pre-emptive raid by NSW Police.

Senior members of the gang were among those charged during Friday night's raid on their recently furnished western Sydney clubhouse.

Officers executed a search warrant on the property in Wetherill Park as part of an investigation into the outlaw motorcycle gang.

As a result, 13 Nomads members have been charged with habitually consorting with convicted offenders and four others charged with various drug, weapons and traffic offences.

Police first raided their western Sydney clubhouse and had it shut down.

Officers executed a search warrant on the property in Wetherill Park at about 7.45pm on Friday as part of an ongoing investigation into criminal activity by the outlaw motorcycle gang.

Following the raid, 13 Nomad members were arrested  under anti-consorting legislation after a joint operation by the Gangs Squad's Strike Force Raptor and Fairfield Local Area Command.

The men were taken to various police stations and were charged with habitually consort with convicted offender.

Gangs Squad Commander Superintendent Deborah Wallace says police wanted to disrupt the group's regular meeting, described as a 'church night' with a party vibe.

It's at these get-togethers that criminals usually meet to hatch out their plans, she said.

'We would allege the clubhouses are used to further their criminal activities and associations,' she told reporters on Saturday.

Consorting-related offences relate to those who organise to meet on two separate occasions with two separate criminals.

'It's a complex piece of legislation, we have to ensure that each criminal has been warned about their association prior to us arresting them,' Supt Wallace said.

During the raid on the Nomads' clubhouse, which was recently created after the shutdown of their previous club two years ago, police say they also found drugs and evidence of illegal alcohol sales.

Drugs, believed to be cocaine, were also found hidden under the petrol cap of a motorcycle.

All those arrested have been granted conditional bail to appear in court in the coming months. 

Gangs Squad Commander Superintendent Deborah Wallace says the arrests were made as part of a crackdown under anti-consorting laws.

'These arrests have been made under legislation that makes it an offence for a person habitually to associate with two more convicted offenders,' she said in a statement on Saturday.

'My message is that if further offences are detected under these laws, my detectives will continue to enforce the legislation to the fullest extent by arresting and charging those involved.'

Supt Wallace said many more consorting-related arrests were anticipated following the raid.

During the search, 13 men were arrested by the Strike Force Raptor under anti-consorting legislation

Four of the 13 men arrested on Friday have been variously charged with traffic, drug and weapon offences

It is anticipated that Strike Force Raptor will be making many more consorting-related arrests.

In addition to the consorting arrests and charges, four of the 13 members arrested on Friday have been variously charged with traffic, drug and weapon offences.

A 25-year-old member of the gang was arrested after a drug dog detected 29 grams of a white powder, believed to be cocaine, hidden under the petrol cap of the motorcycle he was riding. The man was taken to Green Valley Police Station but has been released pending further inquiries.

A 27-year-old associate of the gang was issued with a field court attendance notice for riding while unlicensed. He was also found to be in possessions of an Ice pipe and, as a result, was taken to Fairfield Hospital for blood and urine testing, before being released pending the outcomes of the tests. He is scheduled to appear in Fairfield Local Court on 20 April 2015.

A 21-year-old member of the gang was found to be in possession of a knife and was issued with a field court attendance notice for custody of a knife. He is scheduled to appear in Fairfield Local Court on 23 February 2015.

A 41-year-old member of the gang was caught riding his motorcycle while on a suspended licence. He has been issued with a field court attendance notice for riding whilst suspended and is scheduled to appear in Fairfield Local Court on 23 February 2015.

All have been granted conditional bail to appear in court in February.

Strike Force Raptor was established by State Crime Command's Gangs Squad in 2009. 

It is a proactive and high-impact operation targeting outlaw motorcycle gangs and any associated criminal enterprises.
