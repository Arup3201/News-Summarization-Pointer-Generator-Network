Freeloader: Jeremy Heath, who feigned serious illness in restaurants so he could avoid paying for his meals, has been jailed for six weeks

The least favourite part of any restaurant meal comes when the waiter brings the bill.

But Jeremy Heath found a novel way to avoid paying – he would feign a heart attack and get rushed to hospital.

For almost five years he was the diner who restaurant managers wished wouldn’t come back as he racked up hundreds of pounds in unpaid bills.

He would order drinks and meals before pretending to fall ill when his plate had been cleared and his glass emptied.

In one restaurant he told staff he was desperately ill and they called 999, but he was caught on CCTV finishing his pint of lager as he waited for an ambulance.

Last night Heath was getting all his meals for free again – but this time as a guest of Her Majesty’s prisons. Heath, from Preston, who uses a wheelchair and suffers from cerebral palsy, was beginning a six-week jail sentence after admitting fraud by false representation.

Magistrates in Blackpool were told he was a serial ‘dine and dasher’ who had become the bane of restaurant owners across three counties.

He was said to have begun his fraudulent spree in 2008 after a serious decline in his health and had travelled across the North of England enjoying feast after feast.

He called in at restaurants and pubs in Cumbria, Lancashire and Greater Manchester where he would order a nice meal and then wash it down with several pints  of lager.

On some occasions he would feign heart problems and be rushed to hospital only for him to be discharged when doctors discovered he was perfectly well. At other times, he would say he simply didn’t have the money to pay his bill or tell restaurant  owners his ‘carer’ would pay later.

Lies: Heath pretended to be ill to avoid paying his £41.60 bill at the Shovels Inn in Hambleton in Lancashire

Targeted: He ate a meal washed down by five pints of lager at the North Euston Hotel, Fleetwood - only to confess he could not pay the £23 bill

September 2012 Shovels pub in Hambleton, Lancashire. Tucked into a three-course meal with an extra pudding washed down with six pints of lager. Total cost £41.60

October  Air Balloon pub,  Blackpool. Drank four pints of lager costing £21 and tried to order food – but was recognised by an eagle-eyed waiter who refused to serve him

December North Euston Hotel, Fleetwood. Enjoyed  sausage  and mash with a  sticky toffee pudding washed down by five pints of lager. Cost £23

February 5 2013 Bella  Italia restaurant in Manchester. Enjoyed a meal and drinks worth £41.80

February 9  Pippins cafe in Carlisle. Wolfed down a full English breakfast, six pints of Stella Artois and a packet of Walkers crisps. Cost £22.65

February 10  The Thin White Duke, Carlisle. Enjoyed a meal and drinks costing £41.60, then feigned a heart attack. Taken  to hospital by ambulance after finishing a pint of lager

February 10  Hallmark Hotel, Carlisle. Shortly after being discharged from hospital he enjoyed a cheese souffle and four pints of San Miguel. Faked heart attack when the £19.65 bill arrived at his table

He was jailed for six days last year 
but his appetite for dining and dashing was unabated and he went on 
another conning spree last month.

His lawyer Daniel Harman said: ‘My 
client’s real problem is alcohol – the food is something of a side 
event. One of the remarkable things is that he did not start offending 
until he reached the age of 42 which coincided with a deterioration of 
his health.’

After the case, Paolo Diliberto, 
manager of the Thin White Duke in Carlisle, said: ‘This man played on 
his disability and took us all for a ride.

‘He is totally out of order and this sort of thing causes us major problems especially in the current economic climate.

‘He said he had heart pains but 
unbeknown to us the CCTV filmed him knocking back a pint of lager while 
the ambulance was called.

‘The bill wasn’t paid because we assumed he was poorly.

‘We didn’t think anything of it until 
we had a call from someone at a nearby venue he had done the same thing 
to.’  A member of staff at the Castle Gardens in Poulton- le-Fylde, 
Lancashire, added: ‘He came into the bar when he had  finished and said 
he had no money and nowhere to go.

‘He definitely played on his illness and we felt sorry for him.

‘I ended up ringing the police  for advice to try and get him  some help.’
