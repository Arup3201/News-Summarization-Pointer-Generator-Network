Former Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown received tens of thousands of pounds giving speeches at lavish conferences for AlphaMetrix, the firm now accused of misappropriating £1.7million worth of funds.

Mr Brown speech earned over £60,000, including accommodation and flight costs, for three hours’ work. He gave a keynote speech in Monaco in September, weeks before court papers were filed in the US alleging the firm issued false or misleading account statements to conceal its fraud.

A spokesman said the fee went to charity and towards Mr Brown's own charity and public service work.

Mr Blair reportedly earned £183,000 for a speech at an AlphaMetrix event in Miami in January.Chicago-based AlphaMetrix is a commodity pool operator which acts as a middle-man for hedge-fund managers and investors.

Mr Brown made his gala dinner speech at the Monaco event. One guest said: ‘There were easily 1,500 people there – it was very elaborate. There were four courses and champagne.

'Mr Brown’s comments had nothing to do with anything related to the event – he was just espousing his view of globalisation and how countries need to collaborate. AlphaMetrix get prestigious speakers to attract people to the event.’

Last night, Tory MP Henry Smith said: ‘Blair and Brown should do the decent thing and return the extraordinary sums they received for making speeches to this company.’

Industry regulator, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, is seeking to freeze the firm’s assets, arguing in legal papers unless it is ‘immediately restrained and enjoined by this court, AlphaMetrix is likely to continue engaging in the acts and practices alleged in this complaint’.

AlphaMetrix denies the allegations.

Mr Blair’s office did not respond to requests for comment, and a spokesman for Mr Brown would not comment, although he has said he does not personally benefit from the profits which go to charity and help to run his office.
