They were separated at birth and adopted by two different families in the U.S. but seven-year-old twins Anna and Ella were reunited on Saturday.

The twins' adopted parents had often remarked on how similar their girls were and when they realized the girls shared a birthday, the families started to wonder if they could be related.

After agreeing to a DNA test over the summer, the girls' families discovered they were right, and the twins have since been reunited at Anna's North Carolina home.

Bond: Ella and Anna were separated at birth but have now been reunited

'It's a connection we can't give her. It's something we can never ever provide, and now we have one,' Ella's mother, Teresa Cuares, told Fox Carolina.

At first the twins were shy when they were reunited at the weekend, but they soon developed a strong connection as they began playing.

Neither of their adopted parents had been told that their daughters were twins. The Cuares family were told Ella had been left in a park and Anna's parents, the Kandls, were told she had been left on the doorstep of a hospital.

The families met during the adoption process and stayed in touch through Facebook, where photos of their children, and them sharing the same birthday, made them suspect they were related.

'I'll look at Ella, and I can just see that they are related,' her father, Randy Cuares, said.

Anna's mother, Karen Kandl, added: 'They have a lot of the same facial expressions, so things like that catch me off guard.'

After years of speculation, the parents decided over the summer to do a DNA test, which confirmed Anna and Ella are fraternal twins.

The girls were reunited when Ella's family, who live in Michigan, stopped at the Kandls' North Carolina home on their way to Myrtle Beach.

Ms Cuares said at first the girls were awkward with each other, but added: 'It didn't take long
 for them to realize, "Oh, if we go inside and avoid all this parent 
stuff, we can get to know each other".'

Although Anna gained an older sister, Becky, when the Kandls adopted her, her mother said:Â 'I think it's invaluable for her to know she has a sister.'

The girls and their families plan to stay in touch as the twins grow up.
