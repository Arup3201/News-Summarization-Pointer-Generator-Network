Massachusetts Senator and progressive icon Elizabeth Warren took a subtle jab at possible opponent Hillary Clinton and Clinton's husband today while speaking at a labor conference.

She mentioned neither the former first lady nor President Bill Clinton by name but took shots at his oversight of the financial sector and ridiculed Democrats as well as Republicans for weakening regulations on the banking industry.

Warren says she's not competing for the Democratic nomination for president in 2016, but that hasn't deterred her fans, who are holding her up as a left-wing alternative to Hillary Clinton. 

Clinton hasn't officially announced her candidacy but is believed to be assembling her campaign team in preparation for a possible spring launch.

Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren took a subtle jab at the Clintons today during the AFL-CIO National Summit at Gallaudet University in Washington, D.C. She mentioned neither the former first lady nor President Bill Clinton by name but took shots at his oversight of the financial sector and ridiculed Democrats as well as Republicans for weakening regulations on the banking industry

According to Politico, Clinton has already approached former aide Robby Mook, her likely campaign manager, and Joel Benenson, President Barack Obama's pollster, to join her team.

'She has said that she is seriously considering running for president. She’s casting a wide net, meeting with a variety of experts to discuss the economy and a range of challenges facing American families. And she’s using this time to look at what components are necessary to build an inclusive, thoughtful and technically advanced campaign, so that if she decides to run, she’ll be ready,' a source familiar with her plans told the news publication.

Clinton is known to have been meeting with potential campaign managers throughout the last two months.

Guy Cecil, a veteran of Clinton's 2008 campaign for president presumed to be on the short list for the job, revealed in late December that he'd met with Clinton but wouldn't be running point if she gets into the race, as widely expected.

'I have spent time with Secretary Clinton encouraging her to run because I believe our country needs her vision and leadership,' the former Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Executive Director told Politico. 

'I have offered her my full support and will be her most vocal volunteer, but after 10 years of some of the toughest campaigns around, I am eager to try my hand at something new and to serve my country in a different way.' 

Mook has also been named as a top contender to serve as Clinton's chief strategist and his close friend and fellow Clinton '08 alum Marlon Marshall is anticipated to serve as his right hand man if he's tapped for the job.

Marshall served as a special assistant to the president until last Friday when he left the administration to return to the grassroots consulting firm he helped found after the 2012 presidential election, 270 Strategies.

Clinton has stayed mum over the last few weeks about which way she is leaning, but her talks with top Democratic strategists suggest she's in the process of building a campaign apparatus and could formally enter the race in late March after she's made her last paid appearance.

The former secretary of state has confirmed engagements through March 19 and is unlikely to launch her campaign until she's off the speaking circuit, which helped her add more than $5 million in the last two years to her personal wealth.

The nest egg could come in handy if Clinton needs to dip into her personal funds again to help buoy her presidential campaign.

The money she earned for the paid speeches could prove as much trouble as it's worth, though, as she could find herself spending million in the primary fending off attacks from her own party over payments she has receive from financial services executives to address various industry gatherings.

Progressives worry she wouldn't take a heavy enough hand to Wall Street, which also served as a source of funding for her 2006 Senate campaign.

Clinton has publicly wailed against the 'shadow banking system that operated without accountability' in a speech before the New America Foundation in March, yet she is also said to have privately assured banking executives, whom she charges roughly $200,000 a pop to have her come speak, that she finds attacks on the industry discomforting.

An account of a speech she made to Goldman Sachs published in Politico in December of 2013 described her as more or less telling investors: 'We all got into this mess together, and we’re all going to have to work together to get out of it' and that 'beating up the finance industry isn’t going to improve the economy—it needs to stop.'

Warren indirectly tapped into progressives' concerns that Clinton is talking out of both sides of her mouth today at an AFL-CIO National Summit on Raising Wages.

'Pretty much the whole Republican Party, and, if we’re going to be honest, too many Dems, have talked about the evils of Big Government and called for deregulation,' Warren said in remarks taped by Republican opposition research firm America Rising.

'It all sounded good but what it was really about was tying the hands of regulators and turning loose big banks and giant international corporations to do whatever they wanted to do; turning them loose to rig the market and reduce competition; turning them loose to outsource more jobs; turning them loose to load up on more risks and then hide behind taxpayer guarantees; turning them loose to sell more mortgages and credit cards that cheated American families,' she continued.

Warren later said, 'For more than 30 years Washington has far too often advanced policies that hammer America’s middle class even harder.

'Look at the choices that Washington has made, the choices that have left America’s working families in a deep hole, the choice to leash up the financial cops, the choice in a recession to bail out the biggest banks with no strings attached while families suffered,' she added.

Included in the last 30 years of presidents is, of course, Bill Clinton, who served two terms from 1993 to 2000.

Under Clinton's watch the banking industry saw a serious cut back in regulations after Congress repealed the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act.

In a 2008 interview with Bloomberg Businessweek Clinton contended that the changes he signed into law almost a decade before weren't as steep as his detractors made them out to be.

'It wasn't a complete deregulation at all. We still have heavy regulations and insurance on bank deposits, requirements on banks for capital and for disclosure,' he said at the time.

'But I have really thought about this a lot. I don't see that signing that bill had anything to do with the current crisis.'

Clinton took responsibility for his role in the trim down and said he couldn't 'blame' Republicans in Congress who led the charge against the deregulating the banking industry.

'This wasn't something they forced me into. I really believed that given the level of oversight of banks and their ability to have more patient capital, if you made it possible for [commercial banks] to go into the investment banking business as Continental European investment banks could always do, that it might give us a more stable source of long-term investment,' he said.

The former president also backed the federal government's bailout of banking industry giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and argued that it was 'necessary' to dig Bear Sterns out of the hole it had gotten itself into.

'And it worked. It just didn't stem the tide because of the underlying massive amount of unsustainable debt in the real estate market, both residential and commercial,' he said.

In fact, Clinton said he would have went further and offered the now defunct Lehman Brothers a line of credit similar to what the government offered AIG.

Progressives were quick to applaud Warren's remarks today after they made their way into news reports.

'This morning, Senator Elizabeth Warren clearly articulated the kind of far-reaching progressive vision Americans want to hear in the next Presidential campaign,' Charles Chamberlain, Executive Director, Democracy for America said in a statement

'Ultimately, that's why more than 189,891 people across the country have already signed on to the Run Warren Run campaign urging her to jump into the 2016 race.' 

In his prepared speech AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said Warren in 'an inspiration' and 'her vision of a Raising Wages America embodies our highest ideals.

'Senator Warren is that rare political leader: she shares out values, she really connects with us, she is a genius when it comes to policy, and she is tough as nails when it comes to politics,' Trumka said, according to CNN.

Asked later about Hillary Clinton, Trumka didn't offer as glowing a profile.  

'I think that Hillary did an excellent job as secretary of state. I think she is very, very qualified to be president,' he told reporters at a breakfast Washington. 

'Would I say she is the favorite now? Yes. But I think anytime anybody believes there is going to be a coronation, that is dangerous for the candidate.
