He started out four years ago just decorating his family home but now this father of three is a self-confessed 'crazy Christmas lights guy'.

With 120km of lights and more than one million light bulbs, David Richards has taken out the Guinness World Record for his epic Christmas lights display in Canberra.

Mr Richards, who won the world record last year as well, has graduated from decorating his own home and has instead been tasked with transforming Canberra's CBD into a Christmas light spectacular.

With 120km of lights and more than one million light bulbs, David Richards has taken out the Guinness World Record for his epic Christmas lights display in Canberra

'We had 12,000 people walking down my driveway on Christmas Eve last year. There were queues of hundreds and hundreds of people,' Mr Richards told Daily Mail Australia.

'But this year, I've more than doubled the number of lights... it's far, far bigger.'

Despite it being a time consuming and tiring exercise, Mr Richards goes to these extraordinary lengths every year to raise vital funds for the SIDS and Kids charity.

David and his family - wife Janean and children Aidan, 14, Caitlin, 11, Madelyn, 7 - go to these extraordinary lengths every year to raise vital funds for the SIDS and Kids charity

The Richards family lost their one-month-old son Thomas back in 2002 and they've been fundraising to give back to SIDS and Kids ever since 

'My family had a tragedy in 2002 when we lost our one-month-old son Thomas,' he said. 

'SIDS and Kids helped us so much, so this is our way of giving back to them.'

Mr Richards and his wife Janean managed to raise $138,000 for the charity last year by asking for a gold coin donation when people visited their light display.

'I am the crazy Christmas lights guy just because I tried to raise money for SIDS and Kids,' he said.

The light display in Canberra has been nine months in the making with Mr Richards and SIDS and Kids calling on lighting architects, electrical and civil engineers and designers  to make it happen.

There's 22 tonnes of steel to create towering structures for the 120km of lights to run over - with 200,000 people expected to walking through the twinkling display

'We started construction in October and it's still going. I went to Bunnings this morning to buy 40m of plastic chain so people can line up to access the tunnel of lights,' he said.

'It’s not just a bunch of twinkle lights, it is a light show.' 

David worked with lighting architects, electrical and civil engineers and designers to create the display

Construction on the Canberra CBD project started in October, but planning began in February

There is three of the Christmas present inspired structure within the display

You can visit the SIDS and Kids ACT Christmas Lights in the City from Friday, November 28 until New Year's Eve. Entry is by gold coin donation.
