Tara Kyle, the wife of murdered ex-Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, is suing the bosses of the Texas-based tactical-training company that he co-founded in 2009.

Kyle has filed a suit in Dallas County that alleges that Steven Young, the CEO of Craft International, and Bo French, the company’s COO, have conspired to ‘steal’ the company.

The suit claims that the pair stole Craft’s ‘assets, client lists, contacts, contracts, trademarks, training and operating manuals… and caused confusion in advertising services’.

It also alleges that they have been ‘manipulating Craft’s stock, mishandling funds, diverting assets and mismanaging and usurping Craft’s contracts’.

The suit says that Taya Kyle is the 85 per cent interest holder of Craft and as such has the right to inspect the company’s financial records. However, it is  alleged that Mr Young and Mr French have refused this request – ‘a violation of the Texas Business Organizations Code’.

The pair both had the right to buy Chris Kyle’s share of the company, but did not do so within the time frame of 130 days stipulated by Craft’s rules.

The suit alleges that they diverted Craft’s profits to a new company called Craft International Risk Management.

Kyle’s attorney, Larry Friedman, told The Dallas Morning News: ‘Someone is manipulating the company, and we can’t stand for that.’

The suit describes Mr Young as ‘an experienced thief’, pointing out that he was arrested for burglary of a vehicle in 1988.

When approached by the Dallas Morning News, Mr French made no comment.

Kyle is considered to be the deadliest sniper in U.S. military history with 255 confirmed kills in combat.

While serving in Iraq, insurgents named him ‘The Devil of Ramadi’ and placed an $80,000 ransom on his head.
