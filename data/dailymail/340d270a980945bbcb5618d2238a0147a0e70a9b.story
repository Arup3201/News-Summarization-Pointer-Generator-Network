Roy and Julie Woods spent three decades building their version of paradise in the Adelaide Hills, where they raised their five children and created a haven that survived two previous bushfire disasters. But not this time.

The couple’s beloved home, with its picturesque garden and spectacular views that led it to become a local landmark that even featured in television commercials, was destroyed in minutes when the worst bushfires in decades tore through the region this week.

The couple was on a beach holiday when they learned homes in the Adelaide Hills were under threat, and then they received a phone call that every homeowner would dread – their place was among those destroyed.

The Woods' beautiful home was a local landmark that even featured in television commercials

All that is left of the Woods' dream house are charred and blackened remnants in the Adelaide Hills

The couple had lived together in their Upper Hermitage property for three decades

Very little is left of the house after a bushfire tore through the area burning everything in sight

'Everything was gone. All the memories we made there, all my jewellery, our treasured things, just gone,' Julie, 60, told Daily Mail Australia.

'It was absolutely devastating, like a knife going in. Even now it's surreal, I can't quite put into words how it feels.'

Over 40 houses have been confirmed lost to the inferno, including the Woods’ property. Roy, 70, and Julie, 60, had lived in their Upper Hermitage property for 30 years, raising five children while living there and pouring countless hours of love into the creation of their perfect home which had survived Ash Wednesday and Black Saturday before it was taken away from them in a matter of minutes.

'We were down at our beach shack at Port Vincent two and half hours away when we found out there were fires up in the Hills. Our neighbours rang us to say they could see flames approaching the house, and we were just glued to the television screen trying to find out information,' Julie told Daily Mail Australia.

Its picturesque garden was one of the main features of the georgeous house

What was once a beautiful garden is now just scorched earth and ashes

'We knew that the fire was travelling really quickly and the wind changed and was really strong and just blew the fire back which made it rush up the gully towards our house.

'It was in the firing line, the fire came up fast and hot, and the CFS had to pull back, there wasn't anything they could do.'

The fire consumed their property, including their custom-built pergola, prized garden, and fish pond, which had been the venue for photo-shoots, weddings, and even television advertisements.

Julie's neighbour Paul Howard was the one to break the news to them that the fire had completely destroyed their house, leaving nothing but rubble and ash.

'Paul said it was the hardest phone call he'd ever had to make,' Julie said.

'I've never felt anything like it; it's almost worse than being told someone has died. I lost my dad recently and Roy lost his father, so this is just heartbreaking.'

Roy and Julie didn't receive the official notification from authorities until Saturday, but saw footage of their burnt house on the news, which Roy said was a shock.

'I thought, Christ, that's our house. We'd seen photos of what it looked like so had some idea but it's still shocking. It certainly hardened us up a bit, so we're a bit more prepared for what we'll see when we go back,' Roy said.

The house, which was built in 1966, survived the Ash Wednesday bushfires of 1983 and Black Saturday bushfires in 2009 

The fire grew very quickly making the CFS pull back. All they could do then was look on in horror

The couple have still not seen their property, which for the moment sits desolate and amid a suburb of houses that were unbelievably unscathed by the fire.

The house, which was built in 1966, survived the Ash Wednesday bushfires of 1983 and Black Saturday bushfires in 2009, but 'was no so lucky a third time,' said Julie.

'To have to start all over again at 70 is quite daunting. We've worked hard our whole lives, like so many people, and now I'm not sure what we'll do,' she said.

‘We have had many people comment that it was a spiritual place and it had a very special effect on people when they would visit. We will really miss it.’

Julie ran a well-known curtain-making business from her custom built workshop at the back of the property, which made the loss 'a double whammy'.

'I had two lovely ladies working part time for me who now don't have jobs. They relied on that income and now I have to tell them that there's nothing for them to come back to,' Julie said.

Roy said that trying to figure out where he and Julie would go was extremely difficult, made all harder by the vulnerability of their situation.

'Regrouping is going to be hard. I'm not a young man anymore, and the uncertainty of it all, and feeling so fragile after working so hard is devastating,' he said. 

House proud: For three decades the couple made the property in the Adelaide Hills their home

They both said that they've been incredibly blessed by the love and generosity of their friends and family, and even strangers who have heard of their loss. 

'We're both quite fiercely independent, so it's been very humbling for people to be so loving when we felt most vulnerable,' Roy said.

'It's been hard to accept it, but we've had offers of accommodation and food and clothing. We've had so many beautiful things happen to us,' said Julie.

Roy said that each time he explains what happened to the house he relives finding out about the loss all over again, which has made the ordeal even more emotionally draining.

'We've had so many people concerned about us and wanting to love us, but we find ourselves caught between our own emotions and the needs of other people,' he said.

'This has been an experience which brings you to a level you wouldn't normally go to. When someone dies, you go to a funeral and start the grieving process, but the land is still ours, so that shocking and devastating loss doesn't go away.'

But despite this, if anything, the disaster has brought the couple even closer together.

'We are still very much in love, very solid, and this isn't going to change that at all,' Roy said.

The Woods are preparing for a walk through of their property on Friday, and are using their beach shack as a 'home base' to start to piece together the details of their life they still have in order. 

In ruins: all that stands of the house now are badly burned beams and pillars

'It will be part of the moving on process. It would be amazing if we could find something still left. If I found my pearls that would be a miracle,' said Julie.

'We are luckier than most. We've got some clothes and some other items down here, and it's familiar so we feel somewhat safe. 

'We are so fortunate to be living in a country like Australia where we have a government that will look after us. We're very conscious that wouldn't happen in other places and the spirit of community we have experienced has been amazing.

'The region will rebuild of something as awful as this. Out of the ashes a phoenix will rise and there will be good things to come out of something so horrible.'

They said that they were so grateful to the firefighters and CFS volunteers who had been battling against the fires in the region, labelling them 'unsung heroes'.

'They are just wonderful. We don't even know their names but all the volunteers and police did the best for people they didn't even know and put their lives at risk to help others,' Julie said.

Roy and Julie said that despite the overwhelming devastation of their situation, the experience has taught them about how fragile life is.

Julie Woods ran a well-known curtain-making business from her custom built workshop at the back of the property. It also was destroyed

'Life can change in an instant. You can't take anything in life for granted,' Julie said.

'We enjoyed that house and the garden so much. We got to sit out the back and watch the sun go down with a glass of white wine, and raise our children, and see our six grandchildren at all our family celebrations.

'Some people never get that. We were blessed. No fire or rain can take those memories away from us.'

The bushfires that tore across the Adelaide Hills over the last six days have been declared 95 per cent contained, with only two ‘hotspot’ areas of concern remaining.

Country Fire Service chief officer Greg Nettleton said interstate firefighters were heading home as the declaration of major emergency for the area had been rescinded.
