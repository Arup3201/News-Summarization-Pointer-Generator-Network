Visitors to one of the country’s leading theatres are faking disability in order to get free tickets to watch shows, bosses claimed yesterday.

Currently the Grand Opera House in Belfast allows disabled people who pay to see a production to bring a carer along with them for no extra charge.

But managers suspect that some of the 1,200 customers who signed up to the scheme since it was launched two years ago are perfectly able-bodied and are simply exploiting it for cut-price access to shows.

Managers in the Grand Opera House in Belfast brought in the scheme to attract more disabled theatre-goers

In the last 12 months the venue issued in excess of 3,000 free tickets for carers.

Now it has emerged that theatre managers have written to all members who joined the scheme announcing a ‘review’ – which is likely to involve introducing a requirement to provide medical evidence of disability.

The opera house – which hosted Luciano Pavarotti’s UK debut in 1963 – introduced the scheme to attract more disabled theatre-goers who would otherwise have had to buy two tickets so they could have someone to help them on the night.

The letter states: ‘The uptake of this option has been hugely successful, but unfortunately there is evidence that this aspect of the membership scheme is being misused and seen as an opportunity to avail of free tickets.

‘Unfortunately for this reason we will be reviewing the scheme and introducing some changes in the New Year.

‘It is very disappointing to have to make any changes to the services we offer our customers, but regrettably, we have to ensure that the scheme is fit for purpose, meets the needs of those people who need it most as well as making sure that it remains a viable option of reasonable adjustment for the Grand Opera House.’

The staff will decide what checks will be carried out to detect fakers by working with NI Equality Commission

The review will be carried out by the theatre’s disability advisory group working with the Northern Irish Equality Commission before it announces what checks will be carried out to detect fakers.

However the letter is likely to be seen as a warning to anyone exploiting the scheme by posing as disabled that they will no longer be able to get away with their scam.

A spokeswoman for the theatre stressed that the move was intended to help genuine disabled people by ensuring the theatre could continue to offer them a free ticket for a carer.

‘The scheme has been hugely successful in the last two years, and we hope that access for the most disadvantaged members of our community continues in the future,’ said chief executive Mary-Clare Deane.

‘We will continue to liaise with the Equality Commission for NI and our in house Disability Advisory Group to ensure that we maximize this access for those with disabilities and will be monitoring the use of the scheme in the New Year before introducing any changes.’

Founded in 1895, the Grand Opera House has hosted acts including Gracie Fields, George Formby and Laurel and Hardy.

In 1963, Luciano Pavarotti – then an unknown Italian singer - made his UK debut there in the role of Lieutenant Pinkerton in Madame Butterfly.

Last year Disneyland in Florida stopped allowing disabled visitors to jump queues amid claims that families of able-bodied tourists had been exploiting the concession by paying hundreds of dollars to self-proclaimed ‘tour guides’ in wheelchairs in return for accompanying them.

In order to curb abuse, disabled visitors were instead to be given tickets with a specified entry time that would still be earlier than if they had joined the queue, Mail Online reported.
