A jealous orangutan bit off the arm of a baby orangutan who reached into his enclosure at Dortmund Zoo.

Walter, the orangutan famous in Germany for predicting football scores, bit off the arm of one-year-old Yenko, leaving the youngster screaming and spurting blood.

Yenko, who had been in Dortmund for only a few weeks, survived after an emergency operation, but vets were unable to reattach his arm.

Jealous: Walter the football score-predicting orangutan, who bit the arm off a baby orangutan out of jealousy

Keepers had separated Walter from Yenko and his adoptive mother Toba with a wire fence. The tragedy happened when the youngster put his arm through the mesh.

Yenko is now back with Toba. Zoo bosses believe that Walter was jealous at the attention the baby was getting from his adoptive mother.

Walter has earned a reputation for successfully predicting football results, making his selections by drawing merchandise bearing the clubs logo from identical footballs.

He excited German football fans in May when he predicted that Borussia Dortmund would win the cup final in the country against Bayern Munich by picking out the Dortmund shirt and putting it on his head.

It turned out on that occasion however that Walter got it wrong as Bayern thrashed Dortmund 2-0.
