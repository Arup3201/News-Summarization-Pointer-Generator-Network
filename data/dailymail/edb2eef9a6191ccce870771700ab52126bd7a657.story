Her father has created a multi-million pound high street shopping empire and it seems that Topshop heiress Chloe Green is following in his fashionable footsteps.

The 23-year-old daughter of Sir Philip Green has unveiled her AW13 Christmas collection of shoes and accessories and her A-list friends can't get enough of her designs.

Speaking to FEMAIL about the Chloe Jade Green collection, the designer said: 'I wanted to develop a range that was 
specific to the holiday season that would combine real show stoppers for
 parties and cool biker boots for long winter walks.

'I’ve included 
really cosy winter boots with real sheepskin linings, as well as simple 
classic nude courts that are perfect for any occasion.

'I took 
inspiration from winter frosts and really wanted to incorporate shimmer 
fabrics on some of the plainer leathers. I’ve used real Swarovski 
crystals for the first time this season too.'

Seasonal: Chloe has ensured that her collection has something for everyone - including glamorous heels and rock chic boots

Famous followers: Her roster of celebrity fans now includes Kim Kardashian, Demi Lovato and Nicole Ritchie and she is hoping her latest shoe collection will prove eqaully popular with her starry clientele

Following on from a successful SS13 season, the collection aims to feature must-haves for the winter months ahead. Chloe has added a personal touch by naming each shoe herself.

'I try not to be too influenced by other 
designers - I think it’s more important to stay true to your own 
identity.

'I’ve always wanted the collection to incorporate some of my 
personality and reflect my own style. I think this collection definitely
 encompasses that,' she added.

roster of celebrity fans now includes the likes of A-listers Kim Kardashian, Demi Lovato and 
Nicole Ritchie and she is hoping her latest green-soled shoe collection prove just as popular.

'I love to walk down the street and spot 
girls out with their friends wearing a Chloe Jade Green green sole.

'It’s amazing when I 
see Selena Gomez and Nicole Ritchie wearing styles from the collection.
 It makes me feel really proud of what I have achieved so far.

'I like to think the collection has 
something for everyone with different styles for different occasions. I 
could definitely see Cara Delevingne rocking the Frosty black biker boot,' she said of her showbiz pal.

Chloe also counts supermodel Kate Moss, who is set to launch a new range for Topshop, as one of her closest friends - but is a collaboration between the two on the cards?

'Who wouldn’t want to work with Kate Moss?!'

'She’s such a hardworking, creatively-minded person and passionate 
about everything that she does. I think she’s an incredible role model.'

The former Made In Chelsea star has grown up in a very fashionable world - her father is CEO of the Arcadia Group, which includes Topshop, BHS and Dorothy Perkins - so she has honed her own personal style over the years and knows exactly how to nail the Christmas party look.

'If ever in doubt, always wear a killer 
heel with any outfit. I always think it’s better to be overdressed than 
underdressed,' she advises.

'The Snowflake nude points from my new Christmas collection
 are the perfect option as they’re so comfortable and slick and go with 
so many different outfit options.

'I always try and find an outfit that I
 feel comfortable in too – that way you can be really confident about 
your appearance.'

While she has only just unveiled a new collection, she already has her sights set on future launches.

'I’ve been travelling a lot at the moment
 and gathering inspiration and ideas ready for my new launches next 
year. Watch this space!'

Future projects and celebrity parties aside, Chloe is looking forward to taking a breather from her hectic schedule to spend some quality time with her family at home this Christmas.
