Prince Charles might not be known for his love of ten pin bowling but at least his attempt didn't end up in the gutter.

Instead, the Prince of Wales managed to knock over four pins - much to the delight of veterans and a watching Duchess of Cornwall - although he wasn't pleased with the result.

Charles was at the Armed Forces Retirement Home in Washington D.C to meet veterans on the morning of his third day in the US.

And release: Charles swings his arm back and releases the ball, watched by Army veterans

The American equivalent of the UK's Royal Chelsea Hospital, it houses men who have spent their careers working in all three services.

The six-lane bowling alley gives the veterans who live at the home in Washington a recreational work out and keeps them active.

With the Prince of Wales for the visit was Camilla who looked wonderful in a pale gold coat and who looked on admiringly as Charles tried his hand at bowling but gave it a miss herself. 

Chief Petty Officer Patricia Kirchner, who manages the alley, told that Charles, as he walked over to the lanes, said: 'I've got a couple of bowling balls picked out, just try one.'

With the Duchess of Cornwall at his side Charles, who had turned down the offer of some bowling shoes, confessed 'I haven't done this for a long time'.

But he gingerly picked up a bowling ball and sent it down the fifth lane more in hope than expectation.

His execution looked good but the bowl ran wide and clipped three pins that toppled over and he turned to Camilla and said: 'At least I got one'.

Bill Bowen, an 80-year-old retired staff sergeant from the US Air Force, said: 'He did pretty good,' adding, 'I told him I was the worst bowler in this alley and he said "no, I am".'

The couple had begun their day by visiting President Abraham Lincoln's cottage and were met by Erin Carlson Mast who is in charge of maintaining the property.

Mrs Mast also had presents to dispense: a book entitled Lincoln's Sanctuary for Charles and another called What Do You Do With An Idea for his grandson, Prince George.

Afterwards, the royal couple were ushered to the Armed Forces Retirement Home and were whisked into the Scott Building which houses many of the residents.  

Along with a visit to the bowling alley, the royal couple were also shown the library, which boasts stunning views of the Washington Monument, and the wellness facilities for the pensioners who live there.

Stunning: It was at the cottage that Lincoln dreamed up the 13th amendment which bans slavery

The centre, which sits in the same grounds as Lincoln's Cottage, is one of two in the US, with the other located in Gulfport, Mississippi, and was established in the late 19th century.

Not far away is the cottage itself, which is particularly notable because it was there that Abraham Lincoln lived for a quarter of his presidency. 

He also used the cottage during the American Civil War and dreamed up the 13th amendment, which outlaws slavery, while living there.

Charles and Camilla are on the third day of a four-day state trip that has been described as 'your grandfather's royal visit' by the local Washington Post.

In a piece headlined, 'Camilla and Charles don’t get the WillKat [William and Kate] treatment, but it’s still royal', the paper went on to contrast the 'high-volume excitement worthy of boy-band' that greeted the Duke  of Cambridge with the quieter one offered to his father.

But while Charles and Camilla aren't getting the rockstar reaction enjoyed by the younger generation, the visit is seen as 'crucial' - for Charles at least.

That echoes comments made by British Ambassador to the US Sir Peter Westmacott who described the tour as being a fillip for Anglo-American relations. 

Later, the royal couple will be whisked to the White House where they will meet President Obama in the Oval Office for the second time since he took office.

President Obama is the sixth American president to entertain Charles, who has visited the US on 23 separate occasions, during his royal career and is unlikely to be the last.
