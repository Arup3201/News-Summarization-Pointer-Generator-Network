After his tirade against a taxi driver, getting home from a night out must be a headache for David Mellor.

So as midnight approached and looking worse for wear after dinner with friends in central London, the Tory grandee turned to his partner Lady Cobham for a lift instead.

But the man once nicknamed the Minister of Fun did not look like he was enjoying his ride one bit as, ruddy-faced and with his tie askew, he sat slumped in the front seat of the snug red Peugeot 206.

Mr Mellor was this week accused of calling a taxi driver a 'sweaty, stupid little git' when he became angry about the route taken by the driver

One can only hope he approved of the route Lady Cobham, who is the chairman of VisitEngland, took back to their £8million riverside home on Thursday night.

Mr Mellor, 65, was this week accused of a disgraceful outburst against a taxi driver after he was caught on tape calling him a ‘sweaty, stupid little git’ when he became furious at the route taken by the driver.

The former minister listed his achievements, yelling ‘I’ve been in the Cabinet, I’m an award-winning broadcaster, I’m a Queen’s Counsel’, before demanding: ‘Who are you to question me?’

Cabbies vowed to refuse to pick up Mr Mellor as a result.

These photographs of him were taken 48 hours after news of his outburst broke.

Yesterday an onlooker said: ‘He’d been having dinner for at least two hours in St James’s, then he came out and was on his mobile for a while. We wondered if he was calling for a cab, but I don’t think a cab would pick him up now. Then his missus arrived.’

Mr Mellor’s outburst was secretly recorded last Friday after a visit to Buckingham Palace, where Lady Cobham was presented with a CBE for services to tourism.

Mr Mellor also accused the taxi driver of ruining his ‘wife’s’ day – referring to Lady Cobham. As these pictures show, she did not look particularly delighted to be behind the wheel as she drove him home either.
