The self-styled lord who led the life of an international playboy while masterminding a huge fraud must sell his lavish London home to avoid another decade behind bars.

Edward - ‘Fast Eddie’ - Davenport, 48, hosted lavish parties at his mansion - which could sell for £30million - and boasted of befriending guests including supermodel Kate Moss and Princes William and Harry.

But the socialite was exposed as a fraudster who duped victims out of their life savings through bogus start-up loan schemes.

Now he must sell 33 Portland Place, in Marylebone, central London, to pay back £14million to his victims.

Debauched: One of the rooms in the 24-bedroom property, complete with poles for pole dancing

Scenes from the hit film The King's Speech were filmed at 33 Portland Place

He bought the 24-bedroom property for just £50,000 from the Sierra Leone government in 
1999 while the country was embroiled in a civil war.

The
 five-storey, 110-room house was used for film shoots, a fashion 
show and a masquerade ball, while his swimming pool was reportedly 
filled with Cognac so revellers could row through it.

Scenes
 from the Oscar winning film The King's Speech were also filmed there, 
and Kate Moss was filmed walking down its staircase wearing nothing but 
stiletto heels and underwear for an Agent Provocateur advert.

Singer Amy Winehouse used it to shoot the video for her hit song Rehab.

A party that took place at the vast property. Music videos were shot there and fashion shows were also held

He told the Sunday Telegraph: 'This place wasn’t really related to the offences... so it’s all a bit 
  unfair that I’m being forced to sell. Quite shockingly unfair, actually.'

But investigators from the Serious Fraud Office claim Davenport used some of 
  the estimated £34.5 million raised through the fraud to buy and revamp the property.

It is unclear whether he will retain the estimated remaining £16m from the sale of the property.

For two decades, Davenport – the ‘Lord’ refers to a manorial title he bought – was a central  figure in London’s most hedonistic circles. In the late Eighties, his black-tie ‘Gatecrasher Balls’ became notorious for the drunken debauchery of public school-educated teens before they were brought to an abrupt end when he was convicted of tax fraud.

The con artist, born Edward Ormus Sharington Davenport, promised millions of pounds to investors which never materialised after he had pocketed the administration fees and advance payments.

Princess Diana’s wedding dress designer Elizabeth Emanuel lost the life savings she invested with Davenport.

The 
fraudster, who was sentenced to seven-and-a-half years behind bars in 
2011, was not at Southwark Crown Court to hear the Judge Peter Testar’s
 ruling earlier this month.

Davenport,
 who was released from prison on licence in May due to acute kidney 
problems will also have to find £1,943,620 in compensation in addition 
to a £12million confiscation order.

Judge
 Testar said at the time: ‘Through his dishonesty Edward Davenport has 
caused harm to many people and it would be an insensitive judge who was 
not conscious of those whom he had defrauded.’

He enticed his victims with a website boasting of his champagne and sports-car lifestyle and a £100m property portfolio in Britain, Thailand and Monaco.

Davenport claimed to be a familiar face in ‘exclusive venues across the world’ and had ‘extensive business interests.’

His web page boasts: ‘Welcome to the website of Edward Davenport, one of London’s most flamboyant and best known entrepreneurs as well as a true English gentleman from an established British family.’

Among the stars Davenport was pictured with on the site’s gallery were actors Hugh Grant, Jeremy Irons, Jude Law and Steve Coogan and music mogul Simon Cowell.

Davenport, of Portland Place, central London, was convicted after a trial of conspiracy to defraud.

His bill could rise to £15,855,273, if he is ordered to meet both prosecution and defence costs.
