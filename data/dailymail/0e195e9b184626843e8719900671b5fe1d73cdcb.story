The mother of a 10-year-old boy who died after a sand dune collapsed on top of him at a beach desperately tried to revive her son after digging him out. 

Byron Gordon, from Wyndham on the far south coast New South Wales, was digging a hole in the sand alongside his four-year-old brother when the dune collapsed and trapped him at Terrace Beach near Eden, on the far south coast of NSW.

When the small dune collapsed, Byron's brother ran to their mother, Lia, a trained nurse who tried to revive her boy. 

She pulled her son out from beneath the sand, after  she could only see his legs and began to perform CPR on him just after the dune collapsed on Monday afternoon, according to Nine News.

The 10-year-old died after after a sand dune collapsed on him at Terrace Beach in Ben Boyd National Park

Paramedics arrived at the remote and unpatrolled beach at Ben Boyd National Park at around 2.45pm where they tried to treat him at the scene.

Byron was then rushed to Pambula Hospital in a critical condition, after suffering from a cardiac arrest according to an ambulance spokesperson, where he later died.

Police are still investigating the incident, however Detective Superintendent Peter O'Brien told the ABC that the 'most likely scenario is that there was a collapse of some sand onto him causing him to be trapped under the sand and unfortunately unable to breathe'.

'They were just doing what all kids do on the beach: digging holes and mucking around in the sand which is an occurrence that would be happening everyday on any beach in Australia,' Supt. O'Brien said. 

Peter Guenthroth, a friend of the family, told Nine News that Byron was known to be a keen explorer.

'To me it sounds like he was digging head first into the sand dune and got carried away like a kid would, digging a little hole like a little cave,' Mr Guenthroth said.

'He was into exploring caves and doing all natural things.'

Bega Valley Mayor Bill Taylor said the close-knit community would be reeling. 

'We can only struggle to comprehend how family and friends are coping today. We can't even imagine what they are going through,' he told The Sydney Morning Herald.

'It's every parent's nightmare that something like this might happen. A child doing something so innocent and the next minute you have a tragedy on your hands. 

A Southcare Helicopter was dispatched at about 3pm to take him from Pambula Hospital to Canberra Hospital, but he died a short time later.

A spokesperson for Ambulance Service of NSW confirmed that Byron had died on Monday afternoon.

NSW police confirmed the news, adding that the boy's family had been notified. 

Inquiries into the incident are continuing and a report will be prepared for the Coroner.

Terrace Beach is a remote area, accessible only by a walking track or 4WD. The closest patrolled beach is 25 minutes away according to a Surf Life Saving spokesperson.
