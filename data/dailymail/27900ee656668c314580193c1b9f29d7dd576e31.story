Baroness Thatcher remained in hospital today as she recovered from minor surgery.

The 87-year-old former prime minister is expected to spend Christmas there after being operated on three days ago to remove a growth from her bladder after suffering pain earlier in the week.

Following the operation, she was said to be 'in good spirits', and a spokeswoman this afternoon said there had been no change in her condition.

She is not expected to be released from hospital for a few days.

Baroness Thatcher, 87, was moved to a London hospital last week after suffering from pains in her abdomen. She is said to be 'in good spirits' but is not expected to be released for a few days. Pictured above with daughter Carol

Britain’s first female prime minister has her daughter Carol, 59, at her side.

PR
guru Tim Bell, who helped mastermind her three general election 
victories, said yesterday: ‘The operation was a success and she is 
recovering.’

Another Tory source said: ‘I have heard absolutely nothing to suggest that there is any reason to be concerned. She will be in hospital for several days but she has Carol with her.’

Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted her ‘a speedy recovery’ at the weekend.

Surgeons used a ‘minimally invasive’ procedure to remove a growth from her bladder on Friday evening.

Friends said that doctors will want to examine the material that was removed during the operation but that there would be no further news for several days.

One ally dismissed claims yesterday that she might have cancer as ‘pure speculation’.

Sources close to the family said she was doing well

Sources close to the family said she was doing well: ‘When someone is of Lady Thatcher’s age, there’s always concern after an operation, but she is fine.’ 

Lady Thatcher suffered a minor stroke in 2002 which left her with short-term memory loss.

Her health was thrust into the global spotlight this year with the release of a Hollywood film about her with Meryl Streep in the lead role.

The Iron Lady drew criticism from David Cameron and others for concentrating on the dementia she has suffered.

Miss Streep won an Oscar for the role.

Lady Thatcher was not well enough to join the Queen for a lunch with former and serving prime ministers as part of the Diamond Jubilee this summer.

And two years ago she missed an 85th birthday party thrown in her honour by Mr Cameron at 10 Downing Street.

In October she was sufficiently well, however, to mark her 87th birthday with lunch at a restaurant in London’s St James’s district with her son Mark, also 59, and his wife.

She also attended the 50th birthday party of former defence secretary Liam Fox, the modern politician to whom she is closest.
