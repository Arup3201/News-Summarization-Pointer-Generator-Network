She had just completed a six-month jail term.

So when this inmate - known only as Jones - bragged on Facebook that she had reoffended, it sparked an immediate police investigation.

'Just a pic of a souvenir I picked up on my 6 month vacation,' the woman wrote - with a picture of a spork.

Not so fast! A former inmate was tracked down after boasting on Facebook about stealing a spork from jail

'It wasn't easy to get out with me....that's for sure!!!' she adds.

The $0.02 plastic spoon-fork hybrid was apparently taken from the canteen in Manatee County Jail, Florida.

Springing into action, Detective Todd Zink pursued the case.

After finally tracking down the item two weeks later, it was destroyed as a 'bio-hazard'.

Detective Zink wrote in his police report read by Smoking Gun: 'On 12/24/14 I was browsing Facebook and saw a post and picture in the news feed from [the inmate] of a spork that she had stole from the jail when she was released.'

He then called the former inmate's mother, who did not answer.

Eventually, the woman returned his voicemail message and confessed that she had indeed stolen a spork.

Investigation: A detective at Manatee County Jail spotted the Facebook post and immediately sprung into action

She apologized for her actions and agreed to accept the necessary ramifications.

Luckily for the former inmate, Detective Zink was willing to strike a deal.

'I asked her if she would return it in exchange for not filing charges.

'She did so on 1/6/15, leaving it at the Guard Shack as I requested.'

Explaining his subsequent precautions, Detective Zink wrote: 'Since it is unknown how [the inmate] transported the spork out of the jail, I marked it as a "biohazard" and put it into Property and Evidence to be destroyed.'
