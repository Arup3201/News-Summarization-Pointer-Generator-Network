Baroness Thatcher's funeral yesterday was watched by nearly 4million viewers - with the vast majority tuning in to the BBC.

Coverage of the ceremony at St Paul's Cathedral on BBC1 drew an average audience of 3.2million across its three-hour duration, with 4.3million at the peak towards the end of the service.

However, nearly 200 people have complained that the BBC's coverage was biased - with some saying it was too favourable to the former Prime Minister, and others claiming the opposite.

A further 405,000 tuned into Sky News during the funeral, while 204,000 were watching the BBC News channel.

Ratings for the funeral dwarfed those of other channels from 9am to midday yesterday.

ITV,
which controversially decided to continue with its scheduled 
programming, drew 1.5million viewers for The Jeremy Kyle Show and 
1.1million for This Morning.

The
presenters of This Morning, Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby, did
provide some commentary on Lady Thatcher's ceremonial funeral, but many
viewers considered them out of their depth.

The
average audience for the funeral on BBC1 was more than three times as 
many people as would normally be watching in the same time slot.

By this morning, 106 people had written to the corporation to complain that its coverage was biased against Lady Thatcher, giving too much space to her critics and protesters of the funeral.

In contrast, 76 complained that the BBC was treating her too favourably and failing to reflect the country's divided view of her political legacy.

Another 98 viewers registered complaints about the interviews during the programming, which was anchored by veteran broadcaster David Dimbleby.

During the coverage, BBC Breakfast presenter Charlie Stayt was widely mocked for referring to the funeral as a 'wedding' while interviewing radio DJ Terry Wogan.

And the decision to interview Mr Wogan was also criticised, with many viewers claiming that it undermined the gravitas of the occasion.

The life of Britain's first woman Prime Minister was commemorated at St Paul's in a ceremonial service attended by 2,300 guests, including the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, and the vast majority of senior politicians.

Tens of thousands of people lined the streets to see her coffin driven from the Palace of Westminster to St Clement Danes church, where it was transferred to a gun carriage for the journey to the cathedral.
