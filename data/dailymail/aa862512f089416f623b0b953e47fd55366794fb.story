After leading Barcelona to Champions League victory against Manchester City at the Nou Camp on Wednesday night Lionel Messi hit back at those that criticised him earlier in the season before celebrating Spanish Father's Day with his family.

The Argentina international's girlfriend Antonella Roccuzzo posted a picture to her Instagram account on Thursday morning wishing him 'Happy Father's Day'.

Roccuzzo and two-year-old son Thiago each planted a kiss on Messi's cheek as the trio posed for a family selfie to mark the occasion.

The night before Messi had produced another stunning performance and brilliantly set up Ivan Rakitic to score the only goal of the game as Barca reached the Champions League quarter-final for a record eighth consecutive season.

Earlier in the season, however, Messi was subjected to intense scrutiny as he and Barcelona struggled for form. He was beaten to the Ballon d'Or trophy by Cristiano Ronaldo as rumours of transfer surfaced.  

But any concerns that Messi's star was fading have well and truly been dispelled since the turn of the year and, after the City game, he was quick to remind his detractors of the criticism he received.

'A short while ago I was supposed to be a disaster, it's tricky to go from being a disaster to the best form of ones career,' Messi told Canal+ after the game.

During Wednesday's last-16 second leg, although Messi ran the City defence ragged, he met his match against Joe Hart. The England No 1 produced one of the great Champions League goalkeeping performances to thwart Messi with several fine stops.

Had it not been for Hart's heroics it could have been a humiliating defeat for Manuel Pellegrini's side and Messi, in typically sporting fashion, was quick to congratulate him.

'He saved everything. We did all we could to score more goals but the keeper played fantastically well and I’d like to congratulate him. The most important thing was to make it through.'

Barcelona now turn their attention to the small matter of the Clasico on Sunday with a chance to open up a four-point lead over Real Madrid in La Liga, but Messi is expecting a tough match.

'One has to respect them and their current form makes them more dangerous. I wouldn’t say that they’re not in good shape or lacking form. On an individual basis they have great players. We’ll just try and play our game.'
