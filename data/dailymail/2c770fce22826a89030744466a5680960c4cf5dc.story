TV bosses have apologised after a blunder saw many tennis fans miss the dramatic winning points in the French Open last night.

Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic had played two points in what turned out to be the last game in the tournament finale, which was being aired live on ITV.

But with the game, and potentially the match, on a knife edge, viewers were told the coverage would be interrupted for the news and footage was switched to ITV4, the digital channel that many people are still unable to access.

Victory: Rafael Nadal wins the French Open final but not everyone got to see it after ITV's gaffe

Switch: Fans were told in final game that coverage was to be interrupted by the news (file picture)

Rafael Nadal went on to win the final few points and take the trophy, winning 3-6, 7-5, 6-2, 6-4.

But many missed out on the moment he clinched victory and the scheduling decision immediately sparked anger online.

The French Open was listed for coverage between 1.30pm and 5.45pm on Sunday.

At that point, local and then national news was scheduled to run between 5.45pm and 6pm before ITV's Soccer Aid started, which ran from 6pm to 10pm.

Over on ITV4, tennis was listed to run from 5.40pm to 6.30pm, giving reviews a five minute overlap period.

ITV has said this was always the schedule and made several announcements to inform viewers before the change over happened.

But television presenter Nick Knowles took to Twitter to say: 'Can’t believe ITV have switched away from tennis final in last game of last set!!! What about everyone who can’t get ITV4?'

Broadcaster Stuart Linnell called the move 'Probably the worst TV scheduling decision ever!'

He added: 'ITV switching French Open Men's Final to ITV4 just as Nadal wins. Utterly ridiculous.'

Too late? ITV apologised after the final few minutes of the French Open were switched to ITV4

Unlucky: Plenty cannot access digital-only channel ITV4 meaning they missed out on the final minutes

Tennis fan, Jenny Smith, said on Twitter: 'Immaculate timing @ITV just as it goes into the final game of the French open... Cut off to go to local news. Fabulous.'

Another 
Twitter user said: 'Seriously ITV, you stopped coverage on ITV1 [sic] of the 
French Open final in the middle of the winning game for the regional 
news? *slow clap*'

ITV4
 was launched in November 2005 and the channel is broadcast on digital 
terrestrial, satellite, cable and IPTV platforms.

A number of factors, such as the geographical surroundings and signal strength, are believed to affect what channels some Freeview viewers' are able to receive.

ITV said it had made viewers aware of the changeover a number of times in advance during the game.

A spokesman told MailOnline: 'On reaching the end of our scheduled slot on ITV we switched our coverage to ITV4, having made viewers aware of the changeover on air five minutes in advance and through ITV's Twitter feeds.

'The information was repeated several times on air and coverage on ITV4 overlapped for several minutes to ensure viewers need not miss any action.

'We apologise for any inconvenience the change in channels caused to any viewers.'

It is not the first time ITV has been forced to apologise for a scheduling blunder.

In 2010, their HD coverage cut off England's opening World Cup goal against the United States.

ITV viewers saw Steven Gerrard's opening goal after four minutes but fans watching on HD were left bemused after the broadcaster suddenly switched to a Hyundai advert.

Viewers of ITV HD had their coverage of the game suddenly cut short after just 3mins 26secs of play.

ITV blamed 'human error' at an outside company and apologised 'unreservedly' for the error.

Coverage resumed at 3mins 46secs, with Gerrard celebrating his strike sparking outrage among England fans, who blasted the broadcaster on social network sites.

A year earlier millions of viewers vented their disbelief and anger that ITV had cut to an ad break for Tic-tac mints and Volkswagen as the extra time winner was scored in the live FA Cup clash between Liverpool and Everton.

Their rage brought a personal apology from ITV boss Michael Grade yesterday who described the incident as 'a shambles' and a 'technical cock up.'

The goal, by Everton's Dan Gosling, came two minutes before the end of extra time.

The incident happened four years after more than a million ITV HD viewers missed Steven Gerrard's England goal against USA in the 2010 World Cup.

Coverage of the game on the high definition channel suddenly cut out at 3mins 26secs and switched to an advert before going blank.

When footage resumed 20 seconds later, viewers saw Gerrard celebrating his goal.

ITV blamed the fiasco on 'human error' at an outside company and apologised 'unreservedly' for the error.
