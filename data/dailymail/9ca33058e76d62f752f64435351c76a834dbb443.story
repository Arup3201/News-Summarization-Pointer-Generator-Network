Jo Pavey became the oldest European champion in history on Tuesday night, just one month shy of her 41st birthday and less than a year after giving birth to her second baby.

Pavey cradled 11-month-old daughter Emily as she did a sprightly lap of honour at the Letzigrund Stadium after winning 10,000m gold just 10 days after taking a bronze medal in the 5,000m at the Commonwealth Games.

Demonstrating remarkable powers of recovery, Pavey went ahead with one lap to go and accelerated down the home straight, resisting the challenge of silver medallist Clemence Calvin of France, who is 16 years her junior.

Champion: Pavey crosses the line to win her first career title at the age of 40

It is a first major title for Pavey, who replaces Russia’s Irina Khabarova as the oldest gold medallist in the 80-year history of these championships. Khabarova won the 4x100m relay title in 2006 aged 40 years and 27 days.

Pavey said of her new record: ‘That’s a really nice statistic to have. It is quite an honour.’

The Exeter Harrier painted an unconventional but touching picture of family training sessions, with her husband and coach, Gavin, instructing drills with Emily strapped to his chest in a baby carrier, while four-year-old son Jacob mimics his mother by running down the long jump runway.

‘We decided to bring them both along (to Zurich),’ said Pavey. ‘It made me really emotional to have her watch it, its the first time she’s seen me run in a major championships. My little boy, too, of course. I can’t believe it, I really enjoyed it but I’m really surprised.’

A model of consistency, Pavey has never finished lower than fifth in her three previous European Championships. She won silver in Helsinki two years ago behind Portugal’s Ana Dulce Felix and on paper was the fifth fastest athlete this year on the start line.

Final push: Pavey hangs on the shoulders of the leaders before making her move late on to take gold

She made things difficult for herself, running wide in lane two for much of the race. After hovering in eighth place in the middle of the leading pack, she moved into third with two laps to go before taking the lead on the 25th and final lap.

Victory looked assured 80 metres from the line. She appeared overwhelmed, looking at the clock before raising her tired arms in a deliriously happy daze.

‘I bet people are criticising me for running wide so much,’ she said. ‘But every time I tried to tuck in I got spiked. I got a bit worried about it, thinking, “this feels a really long way, maybe I should have just done the 5k” but then I thought maybe everyone else was thinking it’s a long way too!

‘I tried to do a controlled last lap because I didn’t want to blow up on the home straight, then I didn’t know how close the other girls were, so I thought, “just give it all you’ve got and you can’t regret anything”.’

It was a poignant moment for Pavey, a prodigious junior athlete who set a British Under 15 record for the 1500m in 1988 but spent most of the following decade blighted by injury.

Celebration: The athlete celebrates her second medal at a major championship in just 10 days

She added: ‘It’s quite funny really, to try for so many years and now do it when I’m 40.’

The Great Britain team will expect to add more medals on Wednesday when Mo Farah is favourite to emulate Pavey’s success in the men’s 10,000m. The 100m trio of Dwain Chambers, James Dasaolu and Harry Aikines-Aryeetey thrived on the speedy Mondo track.

All won their heats with Dasaolu, the second fastest European in history behind Linford Christie, the slowest of the three but the most comfortable. 

The 26-year-old has struggled with a hamstring injury since running 9.91sec last year but he claims to be in better shape than ever. ‘I wasn’t really pushing myself,’ said Dasaolu. ‘I’m expecting a medal, hopefully.’

Dwain Chambers, competing in his sixth European Championships at 36, also eased up in 10.18sec and admitted he was in a race against time to win another medal. ‘The door is closing on me,’ he said. ‘I want to hear the national anthem again.’

Christine Ohuruogu, who originally planned 2014 as a year off from athletics, set a season’s best of 51.42sec to win her heat and qualify second fastest for this evening’s 400m semi-final.

The reigning world champion was contesting only her third race of the year and eased up with 70m to run. Ohuruogu, who won Olympic gold in 2008, is in search of the only major title that has eluded her.
