Do you wake up with bundles of energy, feeling healthy and ready to tackle the day?

Well you’re on your own if so, because most people only rate themselves as being 61 per cent well on an average day.

Across the country, people in Southampton feel the healthiest – rating themselves as 67 per cent well on average, with Cardiff residents feeling least well at just 54 per cent.

The map shows how well people feel on an average day around the country. People in Southhampton, Glasgow and Belfast feel healthiest, at 67 per cent, 65 per cent and 65 per cent respectively - while those in Cardiff and Liverpool are the least well - rating themselves at 54 per cent and 58 per cent well

Nearly all of us (91 per cent) admit to lying about feeling 'fine' when we are really less than 100 per cent.

Just one in 30 people said they felt 100 per cent on the day they were questioned.

But the average person waits nearly two weeks before they see a health professional. 

The poll, by LloydsPharmacy found 30 per cent of respondents turn to their GP in the first instance if they have a health concern, 18 per cent rely on the internet and just six per cent would go to a pharmacy first.

Five per cent of 25 - 34 year olds say they end up in A&E every couple of weeks.

On average we wait 11 days to speak to a health professional about an upset stomach and five days for chest pains – including those with cardiovascular disease.

But struggling on despite nasty symptoms could prove dangerous.

The research found people with asthma wait nine days before seeking help for wheezing, even though this could be a symptom of an asthma attack.

The biggest reason for putting off seeking help for a health problem is being worried about wasting other people's time.
