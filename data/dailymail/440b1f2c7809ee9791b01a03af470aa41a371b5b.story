Yahoo: Yahoo's return to the top is another victory for CEO Marissa Mayer, pictured, who recently marked her first year as the company's boss. Shares of Yahoo have nearly doubled in value since she took the reigns

Yahoo has beaten Google to be named the most visited website in the United States, according to the latest report from ComScore.

The once-fledgling tech company received 196.6 million unique visitors to its search website in July, compared to 192.3 million for Google, the monthly statistics show.

This is the first time Yahoo has taken the top spot for U.S. web traffic since May 2011.

Yahoo has been in the top two or three spots repeatedly, however the company has found securing the top spot tricky for the past two years.

Yahoo acquired Tumblr earlier this year for $1 billion but the traffic haul does not include people who visited Tumblr, according to ComScore.

'Tumblr is not currently included in the Yahoo! Sites roll-up.

'Seems there are other factors at play, and given how close Yahoo Sites and Google have been in recent months it can likely just be normal seasonal/month-to-month fluctuations,' ComScore told Marketingland.

Meanwhile, Google's traffic includes YouTube as well as its search page.

Google: Google dropped from the top spot in the July's most visited website rankings

Rankings: Yahoo beat Google, and Microsoft, Facebook and AOL rounded out the top five

Microsoft properties followed Google and Facebook and AOL rounded out the top five most visited websites in July.

Tumblr is listed separately and came in in 28th position with 38.3 million unique visitors last month and Twitter came 30th with 36.4 million.

But the numbers don't include mobile traffic and, despite recent improvements, Yahoo is widely considered to be behind for smartphones, which may dent its lead.

Yahoo also at the top of ComScore's Ad Focus rankings for July on the basis of internet audience reach.
