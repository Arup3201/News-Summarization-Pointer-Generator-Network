Rebuttal: John Bercow, with his wife Sally, has had previous clashes with MPs

Commons Speaker John Bercow was yesterday accused of driving Parliament’s most senior official to resign by treating him badly and swearing at him.

In an extraordinary intervention in the chamber, Conservative MP Michael Fabricant said that the Clerk of the House was retiring early after Mr  Bercow used the F-word.

The Speaker immediately denied the allegation about Sir Robert Rogers, saying: ‘I’ll ignore that last observation which suffered from the disadvantage of being wrong.’

But Mr Fabricant stood by the claim, declaring he does not believe things should be ‘swept under the carpet’.

The Lichfield MP made the assertion under Parliamentary privilege during a motion to mark Sir Robert’s retirement this summer after a 42-year career in Parliament.

It has previously been suggested that the 64-year-old is leaving early because of a difficult relationship with Mr Bercow.

Sir Robert, who has a £200,000 salary and grace-and-favour home, is the arbiter of the rules of debate. He sits at a desk facing the Speaker’s Chair at part of every sitting in the Commons.

In his prepared speech, Mr  Fabricant told MPs: ‘Our clerk is one of the most popular we have had and, certainly in my 23 years, I can say that’s probably the case.

‘His cheerful disposition, often under difficult circumstances, has been an illumination to many of us and his detailed knowledge of  procedure is important.'

He added: ‘So this clerk will be sorely missed by 
the House and by me. We don’t know why he has chosen to retire early, 
though his working environment behind closed doors has not always been 
easy, as those in the know have already alluded.’

The MP continued, 
spelling out the swear word: ‘In that respect, despite Sir Robert having
 studied Anglo-Saxon at Oxford and being told at least once in front of 
others to F.*.*.* off by you Mr Speaker, I think that wouldn’t have 
encouraged him to stay.’

Last night, Mr Fabricant, who is known as a flamboyant and often outspoken MP, defended his claim.‘I
 got this from witnesses,’ he said. ‘I’ve heard of this type of thing  
happening more than once.

A very well-known member of the Establishment,
 with a capital “E”, was present and was very shocked. This is a knight 
of the shires, a very well-known person, but no one directly to do with 
the Commons.

‘I asked him “did he really say that?” I couldn’t believe it.’

Mr Fabricant was the last to be called in the motion and left the chamber after giving his speech.‘I
 said it, then I left and bowed at him [Mr Bercow] as I left the chamber
 because I respect his position, if not him personally,’ he said.

‘A 
number of colleagues came up and congratulated me and said it was a 
brave thing to do. A Labour MP said it was not the appropriate place to 
say it, but when I asked “where was” she could not answer.

‘I do believe these things should not be swept under the carpet. We know what happens when that occurs.’

Tory MP Michael Fabricant claimed Mr Bercow had told Sir Robert Rogers to 'f*** off'

There have been previous confrontations between Mr Fabricant and Mr Bercow, who had proved unpopular with some Tories.

The MP has claimed Mr Bercow does not treat him well in the chamber and will often call him last during debates.

But yesterday Mr Fabricant strongly denied making the comments to get back at the Speaker.

‘This
 is not revenge at all,’ he said. ‘I do not do revenge, that is far too 
childish. What I did took a lot of personal courage.’ Last night, a 
spokesman for Mr Bercow said he did not have anything to add to his 
comments in the chamber.

Sir Robert became Clerk of the House in 2011
 after a career which started in 1972. He is technically the legal owner
 of all the House’s property, including Big Ben.

MPs gave him a spontaneous round of applause when it was announced that he was retiring.

During
 yesterday’s motion, Father of the House Sir Peter Tapsell, the longest 
serving MP, warned that any Speaker would be left ‘hopelessly 
floundering’ without the assistance of an expert clerk.

Mr Bercow has
 aroused controversy by bringing in headhunters for an external search 
for a new head clerk as the role is usually filled by an existing 
official.
