Found: Ian John McLoughlin, 55, has been arrested after three days on the run after being tracked to an address in London

A dangerous escaped prisoner wanted by
police for the murder of Good Samaritan Graham Buck on Saturday has been found 
hiding in London after three days on the run.

Officers tracked down Ian John McLoughlin, 55, and arrested him at around 
1am this morning after he was spotted by a member of the public.

And detectives have confirmed they have arrested three more people as part of their inquiry into the murder.

The 66-year-old grandfather was stabbed to death on Saturday afternoon after he went to the aid of an elderly neighbour who was being robbed at his home in the village of Little Gaddesden in Hertfordshire.

Earlier today police arrested McLoughlin at a house in Tottenham, north London, on suspicion of robbery and murder.

He was taken back to Hertfordshire for questioning about the killing of Mr Buck.

This evening police confirmed three more people have been arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender.

They are a 54-year-old man from Tottenham, a 45-year-old woman from Edmonton and a 50-year-old man from Hackney.

All three along with McLoughlin are being held at Hatfield police station where they are being questioned.

McLoughlin was on day release from Springhill Prison near Aylesbury in 
Buckinghamshire when he allegedly went to the home of convicted paedophile 
Francis Cory-Wright, 87, in the village of Little Gaddesden, Hertfordshire, on Saturday.

It's believed the two men had met while in prison.

Neighbour 
Graham Buck heard cries for help and dashed to his aid.

Mr Buck was fatally stabbed after confronting the assailant.

McLoughlin, a drifter from Barrow-in-Furness who has been married but is also said to have worked as a rent boy, is being questioned about the murder and robbery.

Detective Chief Superintendent Jeff Hill said Mr Buck, described as a retired financial industry worker, paid the 'ultimate price' for intervening during the robbery at the home of an elderly neighbour.

Mr Buck leaves behind a wife, two sons and a daughter, two grandchildren and a former wife.In a statement police described him as a devoted husband, father and grandfather who 'appreciated his life, getting great satisfaction from his family being happy and healthy'.

Wanted: Ian McLoughlin is believed to have met convicted paedophile Francis Cory-Wright, 88, in prison, and this was when he was last seen over the weekend at a hotel

'He was a man who would help anyone in need, with a strong sense of doing the right thing,' it said.

An earlier statement from Mr Buck's family said: 'We have no words to express how much Graham will be missed. We were all in such a happy place as a family. We were all so settled, with growing numbers of grandchildren whom he adored being around.

'We haven't seen him happier than being around his grandchildren, he was so proud. We cannot get over that we have lost him.

'He's going to be missed by so many people.'

Crime scene: Police and forensics officers worked on the houses belonging to both Mr Buck and Cory-Wright since the killing on Saturday
