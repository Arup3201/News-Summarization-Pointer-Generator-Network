Mauricio Pochettino insists blame for Tottenham’s poor season should lie with him - but the Argentine is adamant he has no regrets about letting Michael Dawson leave the club.

It was quite a claim when set against the dreadful, rudderless defensive performances that have followed Dawson’s summer departure for Hull after nine years in north London.

What the club have lost in both a leader and centre-half could be thrown into sharp relief when Spurs play at Hull, even if they do have the comfort of knowing their worst form has been reserved for games at White Hart Lane.

Mauricio Pochettino blames himself for Tottenham's poor start to the Premier League season

The Spurs boss said that he has no regrets about allowing Michael Dawson to join Hull this summer

Tottenham were beaten 2-1 by Stoke at White Hart Lane in their last Premier League game

It’s at home where four of their five Premier League defeats have occurred, though aside from geography it is clear that fundamental problems exist within a defence that concedes an average of 1.5 goals per game.

Perhaps that ought to make Pochettino question the decision to let Dawson, 31, leave shortly after his own arrival, but the Tottenham head coach said: ‘It was not only my decision – we had a chat with Michael about the situation, and we agreed the best thing for him was to join Hull.

‘We were transparent with him all the way, and we had a very good relationship – we always talked face to face, but I don’t (regret letting him go) because it wasn’t only down to me.

‘I understand the situation with Dawson because I played for more than 10 years with Espanyol before I decided to leave. Like Michael, I was the captain and I shared the decision to leave with the club.

Pochettino has overseen Spurs' worst start to a league campaign since Juande Ramos was in charge in 2008

‘It is always sad, for the people who have been close to you for 10 years, when you part because you share emotions together.

‘But this is professional football, and when you decide to do something different, you need to look forward.’

Certainly looking backwards will offer little encouragement. Pochettino reiterated his belief that his players lack the correct ‘mentality‘, though he was clear that he must take responsibility for sitting 12th.

He said: ‘I have no complaint with the players. I complain with me, with myself, because I need to give them more tools to play better. This is my worry.’

Pochettino attempted to play down suggestions that Jan Vertonghen is unhappy, but the Belgium centre-half is understood to be considering leaving the club after finding his opportunities limited under the Argentine.
