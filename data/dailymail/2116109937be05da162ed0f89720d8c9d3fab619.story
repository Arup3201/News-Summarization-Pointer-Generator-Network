David Cameron arrived in Tokyo today on the first step of a major British trade mission to South East Asia.

Mr Cameron hopes to attract fresh investment in the UK car industry and encourage Japan to open up its  previously closed defence industry to UK firms.

He is also pushing British expertise in 
nuclear decommissioning, as Japan continues its clean-up in the wake of 
last year’s massive earthquake.

Mr Cameron and his Japanese counterpart Yoshihiko Noda,
 are due to discuss tactics for dealing with the global economic malaise.

The visit had been scheduled for last autumn but was postponed amid the eurozone crisis. The Prime Minister confirmed that he will be travelling to Indonesia and Malaysia tomorrow.

Representatives
from BAE Systems, the Nuclear Industry Association and Rolls-Royce will
be among more than 35 senior executives accompanying the Premier on his
trip.

Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt, Science Minister David Willetts and Chief Scientist Sir John Beddington are also going.

Government officials insist that exports to countries where Mr Cameron takes a trade delegation are boosted by a fifth.

Deals are also due on more than £200 
million of new Japanese investment in Britain, said to be creating 1,500
jobs and safeguarding thousands more.

Mr
Cameron will visit Nissan’s headquarters in Yokohama tomorrow, where 
the car giant is to announce that its Sunderland plant will produce a 
new hatchback from 2014.

'It’s
fantastic news that Nissan will be building their new hatchback model 
in the UK and that they expect to create more than 1,000 jobs at the 
Sunderland plant and in the supply chain across the country,' he said.

'It
is proof of the strength and vitality of the British manufacturing 
industry that leading companies like Nissan are expanding their 
production in the UK.'

Other
announcements will include Panasonic setting up a fuel cell research 
and development centre in Cardiff, and a Mitsubishi project in Edinburgh
to build a new type of generator for wind turbines.

The
Prime Minister will stress that the coalition’s policies mean the UK 
has the lowest corporation tax rate in the G7, making it an attractive 
destination for foreign firms.

David Cameron has warned North Korea that it would be 'unacceptable' to defy calls for rocket tests to be abandoned.

Speaking on a visit to nearby Japan, the Prime Minister urged the state to 'take a different path' and engage with the international community.

Mr Cameron and counterpart Yoshihiko Noda discussed the threat from North Korea when they held talks today.

The nuclear-armed regime is putting the finishing touches to a rocket that it says is designed to put a satellite into orbit.

However, the US believes the launch - due this week - is a cover for testing a ballistic missile and Japan has deployed its anti-missile systems.

'On the issue of North Korea we have said very clearly and the Japanese and others have said that it is unacceptable to launch these satellites and missiles,' Mr Cameron told TV station News Zero.

'Now there is a new leadership in North Korea they should be taking this opportunity to change their approach, engaging with the rest of the word and stopping this sort of activity.

'If they go ahead it should be condemned in the strongest possible terms by the UN Security Council.

'We have to send the clearest possible message... Clearly North Korea is quite a bankrupt country; they are unable to feed their own people and interestingly America has been helping.

'We need to explain that they need to take a different path. They need to do less in terms of weapons and the military and more engagement with the rest of the world.

'If they launch this satellite, that is clearly a breach of the UN resolution that has already been ratified.'

He will also call for faster progress towards establishing a free trade area between the EU and Japan.

Japan
is still the world’s third largest economy despite enduring a 'lost 
decade' of stagnation - similar to that predicted by some for Britain.

They
will also hold talks on the dangers posed by nearby North Korea - which
is expected to stoke controversy by test firing a rocket later this 
week.

However, Mr Cameron’s focus on wider 
political and economic matters is unlikely to mean he escapes pressure 
over the continuing domestic fallout from the Budget and civil liberties
rows that have been dogging the coalition.

Speaking to Japanese newspaper Yomiuri ahead of his visit, he said the countries were 'old friends' but wanted to deepen ties.

'There’s an important diplomatic, political sense to this.

'But
also I think that we’re both in need of economic growth and economic 
development, and I think the chance of expanding our trade and 
investment ties is very strong...

'There is obviously very important inward investment from Japan into Britain.

'We’re
very proud of the fact that companies like Nissan, Toyota, Honda - all 
of whom I’ve visited in the UK - very proud of that investment. I want 
to see a new generation of investment into those plants.

'But also we think there’s a big opportunity to open up greater exports from Britain into the Japanese economy.'

Mr
Cameron went on: 'I greatly admire and respect the way the Japanese 
have overcome the enormous challenges of recovery following last year’s 
earthquake.

'The UK stood by Japan in the 
immediate aftermath of the earthquake when we kept our Embassy open in 
Tokyo and through the reassuring advice of our Chief Scientific Adviser,
Sir John Beddington, who will be joining me on this trip.

'Looking
to the future, we want to continue to support the Japanese as they 
reconstruct the Tohoku region and tackle the challenges of the nuclear 
clean-up.

'British companies
have significant expertise in nuclear decommissioning and clean-up, 
with 19 nuclear sites in the UK currently being managed through the 
process.

'I really think that concrete experience can be of direct benefit to Japan.'

Speaking to journalists on the flight to Japan, Mr Cameron said: 'Part of the job of the Prime Minister is to load up an aeroplane full of business people, large and small, get our exports up, get our investment up, get out there and fly the flag for Britain. That is what I am trying to do this week.'

He insisted there was no moral issue with taking arms manufacturers on such trips.

'There are a number of defence manufacturers with us,' he said. 'I’m completely upfront about that because we do have a very strong defence sector. It accounts for a lot of jobs, we have some of the toughest rules on defence exports anywhere in the world.

'But as these countries, particularly Japan, that have tended in the past to buy only American equipment are opening up, there are opportunities for people like AgustaWestland, who make helicopters, who are on this plane.

'I think that’s perfectly responsible and respectable.'

Landmark: Cameron will meet with Burma's democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi on Friday

David
Cameron is to become the first Western leader to visit Aung San Suu Kyi
since the Nobel Peace Prize laureate was elected to parliament.

The
landmark trip to Burma on Friday is another sign that the country is 
being welcomed back into the international fold after taking tentative 
steps to restoring democracy.

The
Prime Minister, currently on a tour of South East Asia, is expected to 
travel to the country’s new capital, Naypyidaw, for talks with President
Thein Sein, before meeting Ms Suu Kyi in Rangoon.

After
years of repressive military rule, a change to a nominally civilian 
government last year resulted in the release of hundreds of political 
prisoners, including Ms Suu Kyi, and a relaxation on media restrictions.

By-elections
held on April 1 - in which the opposition National League for Democracy
won 43 out of the 44 seats it contested - were largely praised by 
overseas governments.

Foreign Secretary William Hague described the results as 'historic' for the troubled nation.

Mr
Cameron’s visit will follow that of US Secretary of State Hillary 
Clinton in December. Announcing that trip, American President Barack 
Obama praised the country’s civilian government for encouraging 
'flickers of progress' after 'years of darkness'.

Last week, the US announced that it was to ease sanctions on Burma in response to its move towards democracy.

The
European Union is currently considering a similar relaxation of its 
restrictions on the nation. Foreign ministers will meet in Luxembourg 
later this month to discuss the further lifting of sanctions.
