Beth Kenneh always dreamed of being a writer so when her friend suggested reviewing sex toys for a website she jumped at the chance.

The 32-year-old part-time carer, from Berkshire, got hooked on testing the products and started her own blog, where she now posts reviews for up to three toys a week.

She even gets her friends asking her for sex and relationship advice, from what to wear on a naughty weekend to how to spice up their sex life.

32-year-old Beth Kenneh has been testing sex toys for just over two years and says her friends always come to her for advice on their sex lives 

Beth said: 'Most of my friends think what I do is interesting. They ask how it works, if I get paid, if I get free toys.

'People then come to me for advice about their sex life. I get asked by my friends, as well as by strangers on Twitter.

'I don't feel uncomfortable about giving advice. If they've come to me with a question I'll do my best to answer it.'

Beth started her blog, Naughty Corner, in 2012 and she now gets 6,000 hits a week.

She gets the toys for free in return for a detailed and honest review on her site.

Describing herself as 'like a kid at Christmas' when a new toy arrives, Beth usually opens and uses her delivery straight away.

She said: 'At first I was going to people to get products to send to me to, but now companies come to me with products too.

'From sponsorship and advertising I get around three grand a year from the site.'

Beth keeps all of her toys under her bed, she says she wouldn't tell a partner about her blog, Naughty Corner, straight away 

Beth continued: 'I review two or three toys a week. Sometimes I get asked to write sponsored blog for a company. I would say I put up three blogs a week on average - one sponsored and two personal.

'The process between receiving the toy and the review going live is between three and seven days.

'If it's something that I get and I like it straight off it's two days to test, then another day to write the review. I write notes as I test the product.'

And Beth says if she doesn't like a toy at first she will give it another go: 'If I get something that's a bit funky then it'll take me a bit longer. 

'I have to think that even though I don't like it first time, I might notice something else after a few uses, or there might be something that appeals to other people.'

Beth, a part time carer, does not have a boyfriend at the moment but revealed that one of her previous partners was happy to try out the toys with her 

Beth will review any products, from sexy lingerie to dildos, but without a boyfriend she is mainly unable to test couple's toys. She does have a willing participant if needs be however, known on her blog as Mr Monkey.

She said: 'I am single at the moment, but I have had a boyfriend since doing the blog. He used to love trying the toys out with me.

'We broke up because he moved away, but we stay in touch and he asks after the blog and reads it. It kept our sex life exciting.

'I am limited now as I can't test toys for couples, but I wouldn't rush into telling someone new about my blog. It's hardly something you can just drop into conversation.

'If I liked him and it was going somewhere then I would tell him I'm a sex blogger and see how he takes it.

'I currently masturbate about five nights a week which is probably more orgasms a week than I would experience with a boyfriend.'

Beth has revealed that far more people are into the sex toys now thanks to the popularity of books like 50 Shades Of Grey

Beth also praises the likes of 50 Shades Of Grey for making her job much easier.

She said: 'The likes of sex toys, fetish and BDSM is a lot more recognised now and seen as a lot more 'normal' thanks to the likes of 50 Shades. People are more forthcoming with their fetish likes.

'It's made my job a lot easier though. People are looking to try new things in their relationships.

'To be honest though, I didn't really like the books, I had to force myself through them. Christian Grey, the lead character, comes across as narcissistic. He was verging on being a stalker and I found it a bit uncomfortable.

'Unfortunately 50 shades Of Grey mis-portrayed the BDSM lifestyle. BDSM is all about communication, mutual respect and pushing boundaries with consent.'

Beth stores her sex toys in a unit under the bed and in a chest. She said: 'If I have chance I will go back to my old favourites, but I get so many news toys I don't often get chance. My favourite is the Rock Soft Bullet.'

Beth gets sent her sex toys for free but says that if she has time she still likes to go back to her old favourites
