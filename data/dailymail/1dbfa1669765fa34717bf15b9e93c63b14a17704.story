Kerry Bailey, 36, fell to her death from a colliery pit wheel after an eight-year alcohol addiction

A drunk mother-of-two fell to her death from a colliery pit wheel after she failed to give up alcohol despite a stint in the Priory.

Kerry Bailey, 36, had called her husband at work to tell him she loved him before she vanished from the family home in Boothstown in Salford, Greater Manchester.

Her body was found four days later by a visitor at the former Astley Green Colliery near Wigan, which is now a museum, an inquest heard.

Mrs Bailey had temporarily moved out of her family home and checked into a rehabilitation unit in a bid to kick her eight year addiction to vodka.

But after checking out in February this year, she secretly began drinking again and confided in a parent at her daughter’s school that she could ‘no longer go on’.

The hearing at Bolton Coroner’s Court was told Mrs Bailey, a former kickboxer, had turned to drink after being taunted by a tough childhood.

She had been taken out of school when she was 14 to help bring up her five brothers and a baby when their father walked out.

She later married her childhood sweetheart Derek Bailey, 37, and had two children – Joe, 15 and Jade, 12.

But the inquest heard she would hide her problems from her family due to her ‘not saying anuthing to anyone, you keep it in here’ upbringing.

Mr Bailey said over the past eight years her drinking had worsened and she had tried self-harming on numerous occasions whilst intoxicated, including taking overdoses and throwing herself from a balcony at their home.

She was later seen by a psychiatrist and was admitted to the Priory and moved away her husband and the children to ‘get herself back to square one’.

When she returned earlier this year she appeared to be improving and stayed sober, throwing herself into her work as a carer and doing 12 hour shifts – with colleagues describing her as ‘the best carer they had ever had’.

Her condition deteriorated in May when Mr Bailey went to Spain for a pre-arranged weekend, leaving his wife to look after their children whilst his parents checked on her.

He phoned home to learn she had taken them to Blackpool and although Mrs Bailey insisted she was fine, her husband sensed something was wrong and when he spoke to his son put ‘two and two together’.

When he got back he found a bottle of vodka and discovered his wife had ‘upset’ the children after taking the opportunity to drink while he was away.

The following evening the couple attended an event at their daughter Jade’s school and whilst there Mrs Bailey had disclosed to fellow parent, Teresa Fitzgerald, that she had ‘had enough’.

Mr Bailey told the hearing: ‘I had gone for a cup of coffee and Teresa was making chit chat, she said “Teresa I have just had enough of this life”. Teresa said: “You have got your children” but she said “Derek is more than capable of looking after them”. Kerry loved them more than anything in the world.’

When Mr Bailey confronted his wife about her drinking the next morning she denied it.

‘She upset us again, the trust again had gone and that was the argument,’ he added.

She had phoned her husband to say she loved him before she went missing and was found four days later

‘She said “why are you being so cool with me”. I said “Kerry you are drinking again”. She denied it.’

Later he got a call from her whilst they were both at work where Mrs Bailey told her husband ‘you will be burying me next week.’

Mr Bailey told the hearing: ‘She said “Derek I have had enough of this life, I love you but this is the last time you are going to speak to me”.’

He immediately rushed home from his job as a garage boss but found she had already left where a neighbour said she spotted her leaving the house at about 2pm.

The coroner recorded an open verdict and said it is not known how she came to fall from the wheel

Despite a police search and a public appeal for information about her whereabouts the care worker was not found until four days later on May 25, this year, when a visitor spotted her body lying face down in long grass.

The inquest heard she bought a small bottle of vodka from the Costcutter store and less than an hour after she was seen leaving the house she was spotted climbing up to the colliery wheel.

Tests showed Mrs Bailey was more than three times the drink driving limit at the time of her death.

Her black rucksack along with a half bottle of vodka was found at the scene.

Recording an open conclusion, Coroner Mr Alan Walsh told Mr Bailey it was likely his wife had consumed ‘much more’ alcohol than the half bottle of vodka and it would have impacted on her co-ordination.

He said: ‘I believe she found that support in alcohol and tried to overcome some of her problems with alcohol and some of her thoughts by the use of alcohol.

‘All the attempts of self-harm occurred while under the influence of alcohol.

‘It’s not known how she came to fall. She may have jumped, she may have fallen. What we do know is that she was under the influence of drink and in a condition where co-ordination is reduced.

‘I’m not sure at that time she had sufficient capability to make a judgement to take her own life. It would be speculative.

‘I don’t believe you could have done any more than you did. Sadly she found some support in drink and sadly that drink was her destruction.’
