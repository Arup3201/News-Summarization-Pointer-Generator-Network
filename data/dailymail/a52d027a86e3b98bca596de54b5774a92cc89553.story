A teenager has recreated some of the most iconic album covers of all time using just Lego blocks.

Harry Heaton used the building blocks to mirror the well-known designs and has since been inundated with requests from fans who have sent him suggestions of their favourite album covers after he posted the pictures online.

The 17-year-old, from Pyrford, Surrey, decided to experiment with the idea after he saw a similar technique used online.

The aspiring guitaristâ€™s passion for music led him to look to his favourite album artwork as inspiration for the project.

He said: 'My love for music was my main source of inspiration for these Lego album covers.'
