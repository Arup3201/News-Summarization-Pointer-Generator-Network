A Sydney mum who won $10,000 on the Today Show this morning has hit back at trolls who attacked her for not deserving the prize.

Amanda Bushe won the money as part of the morning show's Knock of Cash promotion, when weatherman Steven Jacobs arrived on the doorstep of her Eschol Park home to surprise the pregnant single mum.

Ms Bushe eventually emerged wearing her dressing gown, and explained she has been unable to work during her pregnancy. 

Sydney mum Amanda Bushe, who won $10,000 on the Today Show this morning, has hit back at trolls who attacked her for not deserving the prize

She said the money would 'massively' change her life.

Ms Bushe also said she had recently been served with an eviction notice as a result of not being able to pay the rent.

Her friend, Nicole, who nominated her for the prize said Ms Bush is 'one of the strongest and most lovely women' she has met, and very deserving of the cash.  

However, viewers of the show quickly took to Today's Facebook page, attacking her justification for being job-less.

'I didn't know your (sic) could get evicted for being pregnant, must be another reason!!! and she said she only took kids in to look after them that's not a foster parent because foster parents get paid to do that,' one person wrote.

Channel Nine weatherman Steven Jacobs arrived on Ms Bushes doorstep as part of the Today Show's Knock of Cash competition

Ms Bushe, who answered the door in her dressing gown, initially slammed the door in the presenter's face

'This annoys me! It's called priorities! I was a single mum with two kids one with a disability for 8yrs, no family to help me and I never once was not able to pay my bills!' another commented. 

'How about giving away cash to the average bloke & lady that work long hrs that are on a low wages just to give them a break well like that will ever happen these shows & radio shows always go after people with all the problems in world,' one Facebook user complained.

Ms Bushe then leaped to her own defence, and swung back at the trolls attacking her.

She explained that she had slept for little more than an hour overnight due to her medical condition, which explained her seemingly dazed and confused state when first opening the door.

'I opened the door in my robe (that didn't have a tie) having no idea who was there and to be honest was a bit worried having a mic shoved in my face by a complete stranger not knowing what was going on,' she wrote.

Online trolls attacked the mum's win, saying she 'didn't have her priorities in order' and that her pregnancy wouldn't have caused her not to have a job

Ms Bushe quickly leaped to her own defence. 'I was in a good job and a comfortable position before I fell pregnant and was able to afford these luxuries' she said

'As for my piercings and tattoos. I was in a good job and a comfortable position before I fell pregnant and was able to afford these luxuries. I didn't get pregnant then run off and decide to get a million piercings.'

'As for fostering kids I don't do this through foster care. I have taken kids in that have been kicked out of home and have nowhere to go. 

'So to answer some questions in here no I don't get anything for it.'

Other users quickly began to throw their support behind Ms Bushe, and started hitting back at the 'cruel hearted' and 'small minded' people who were critical of her win.

'Australia has become such a nasty country! So jealous that you all have to put this lady down when you don't know her situation and don't forget she's been a foster mum to many kids.'
