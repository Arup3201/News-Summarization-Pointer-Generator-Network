Stuart Lancaster backed Alex Goode to fill Mike Brown’s shoes in Dublin as England look to take the next step towards a Grand Slam against Ireland.

The Saracens full back was named in Lancaster’s starting line-up for Sunday’s clash after Brown pulled out with concussion suffered against Italy while Jack Nowell was also name on the left wing in place of Jonny May.

‘There’s no doubt we’ll miss Mike,’ Lancaster said. ‘He’s been an integral part of the team and his work under the high ball is exceptional. The energy he brings and his defence are excellent and his kicking game has been a big plus for us game in this Six Nations.

‘But Alex Goode is a more than able replacement. He’s been in excellent form for Saracens. He played in this game two years ago and he brings a lot to the party.’

Nowell’s return for his sixth cap has been widely expected after May struggled in England’s opening wins over Wales and Italy.

The Gloucester winger scored one of the finest tries seen at Twickenham against New Zealand in November, but he wasted a three-on-one overlap against Italy and his defence has long been a source of concern. 

‘Jack rarely makes an error and is good under the high ball,’ Lancaster said. ‘His consistency edged him over Jonny in this game.

‘International rugby is about taking chasing and pulling together an international performance I think Jonny will return a better player. It happens to players. Look at Billy Vunipola in the autumn.’

In the third and final adjustment to the match-day 23, tighthead prop Kieran Brookes is withdrawn from the bench after failing to recover from a hip flexor strain, giving Henry Thomas his first chance of the Championship. 

Just like England, Ireland have also won both their opening Six Nations games.

'They have nine British Lions in their starting 15, so they're full of high-quality players and obviously well-coached,' Lancaster continued in an interview with Sky Sports. 'You can see that by the way their maul's put together, their defensive system, their attacking threats, their kicking game. 

'When you've got that club-country cohesion as well, the Leinster connection that Joe [Schmidt] has,  with Johnny Sexton, I think that's part of it as well. They're a very good team, and playing great rugby at the moment.

'It's a big game for both teams. We've had a great two weeks preparation, it's a settled team, and we've built on the back of the Italy game and the Wales game, and away from home third game in, it's a big challenge. We've got two home games to come, but we'll look forward to this one first.'

Brown was immediately treated by the England medical staff before being carried off on a stretcher 

To the relief of team-mates and fans however, the full back was able to return to watch the rest of the match
