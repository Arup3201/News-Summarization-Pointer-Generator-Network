Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Thursday that a family of dissident ranchers and their supporters in his home state of Nevada are 'domestic terrorists,' citing this week's standoff with the federal government's Bureau of Land Management.

Cliven Bundy has refused to pay grazing fees for land where his hundreds of cattle roam every day. The land is owned by the federal government, which says he owes more than $1 million.

Bundy, however, insists that since his family has been using the land since the 1870s, Uncle Sam can't collect the grazing fees.

A tense standoff developed this week after armed BLM officers and other federal agents seized more than 400 head of cattle after a judge declared that Bundy was trespassing.

Harry Reid called a group of dissident Nevada ranchers and their supporters 'domestic terrorists' after their standoff with the federal government over cattle-grazing fees

Officers tasered protesters on a road near the ranch after they left a government-designated 'free speech zone.'

As Bundy's resolve stiffened, more than 100 armed self-styled 'militia' members gathered to defend him. After more than a day of hair-trigger tension, the government backed down. Most of the cattle are being returned.

Speaking at a Las Vegas Review-Journal event on Thursday, Reid dropped a rhetorical sledgehammer.

'These people, who hold themselves out to be patriots are not. They’re nothing more than domestic terrorists,' he said.

'I repeat: What happened there was domestic terrorism.'

'There were hundreds – hundreds of people from around the country – that came there,' Reid said. 'They had sniper rifles on the freeway. They had assault weapons. They had automatic weapons.'

Reid claimed that some protesters said they had 'children and women lined up because if anyone got hurt we wanted to make sure they got hurt first, because we want the federal government hurting women and children. ... What if others tried the same thing?'

He also said he had spoken with Attorney General Eric Holder, FBI Director James Comey, Interior Secretary Sally Jewell and Clark County, Nevada Sheriff Douglas Gillespie about the situation.

The Bundy matter is 'not over,' Reid declared. 'It is an issue that we cannot let go [or] just walk away from.'

Rancher Cliven Bundy has become a rallying point for anti-government activists who object to Washington, D.C.'s intrusion into the Western United States' cowboy culture

Reid said he doesn't intend to back down permanently, and is forming a federal government task force to evict Bundy and his cattle from the contested land

The government declared the land hear Bunkerville, Nevada off-limits in 1993, citing a need to protect an endangered desert tortoise.

But some studies indicate that cattle-grazing improves the species' habitat and increases its chances of survival.

Bundy's claim that his ancestors' use of the contested land gives him a special right to graze cattle there without paying the government that owns it may run into an insurmountable obstacle.

Nevada's 1864 Constitution, which was ratified before his family started using the land, cedes authority over public lands to Washington.

'The people inhabiting said territory do agree and declare, that they forever disclaim all right and title to the unappropriated public lands lying within said territory,' it reads. ' and that the same shall be and remain at the sole and entire disposition of the United States.'
