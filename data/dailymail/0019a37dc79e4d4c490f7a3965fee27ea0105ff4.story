A mother has told how her sex life has been boosted after downloading a Kama Sutra app from the internet.

Emily Hiley, 25, claims she has tried out 400 different positions with her boyfriend after getting the interactive 3D sex guide.

Mother-of-four Emily and boyfriend Chris Eltringham, 21, now take their iPad to bed with them for lovemaking sessions and the pair have mastered several complex sex moves including the Wheelbarrow, the Catherine Wheel and the Prone Tiger.

Emily Hiley and her boyfriend Chris Eltringham have worked their way through more than 400 sexual positions after taking their iPad to bed and using the Kama Sutra 3D app, Karma Xcitra

Emily said: 'It's really easy to try new moves - you can spin the screen around for a 360 degree view of each position.

'Sometimes they are tricky to get right. But this way we know exactly how to lie or stand or kneel.'

Emily has dated Chris, who works as a career, since 2011 but after two years of passion their sex-life started to stall.

But the couple kickstarted things in the bedroom after downloading the Xcite Books' 3D sex app.

Emily and Chris now describe themselves as being 'sex-obsessed' and sleep together every night of the week.

The pair bought a copy of ancient Hindu sex bible, the Kama Sutra, to add a bit of spice to the bedroom.

After just three months they had worked their way through the entire book of 365 positions at their home in Erdington, Birmingham, so they started looking for another aid to satisfy their sexual appetite and found the app online.

The interactive programme added an extra 69 positions to the original found in the book, taking their tally to 444.

And within a couple of months the couple had found their way out of their sexual rut.

Stay-at-home mother Emily said: 'I'd never had that sexual spark with someone before I met Chris - it was like he lit my desire fire.

'We are so compatible. He knows everything about me.

'We've tried all sorts together - ropes, handcuffs, toys and worked our way through the Kama Sutra.

'I've hit my head more times than I can remember. Chris has fallen off the bed, off chairs, even out of our car.

'It's all good fun though. We laugh together and communicate. It's all part of trying new things.'

The couple say they are extremely compatible and the app has helped them get out of their sexual rut

The Karma Xcitra has interactive images of 69 positions and even allows users to add a customised soundtrack.

A spokesman for Xcite Books, said: 'Karma Xcitra uses state-of-the-art technology to help couples explore interesting sexual positions whilst having fun in the process.

'We’re using mobile technology to make the classic sex guide more relevant and easier to use for today’s readers.'

The Kama Sutra is an ancient Indian Hindu book and part of it outlines practical advice on sexual intercourse.

'Kāma' means sensual or sexual pleasure, and 'sūtra' literally means a thread or line that holds things together.

Whilst it mainly describes being sensuous, Kamasutra also ascribes to religious faith and tradition of the Hindu system.  

Historians believe Kama Sutra was written between 400 BCE and 200 CE.
