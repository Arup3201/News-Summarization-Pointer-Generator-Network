Ed Miliband has admitted he looks less like a Prime Minister than David Cameron – and highlighted his resemblance to Wallace of Wallace and Gromit fame.

Declaring that ‘there’s more to politics than the photo op’, the Labour leader attempted to portray himself as a politician of substance, compared with Mr Cameron’s political ‘posturing’ and focus on appearance.

But within minutes of finishing his speech yesterday, it emerged Labour is to hire an £80,000-a-year spin doctor to improve the way Mr Miliband looks on television.

And critics pointed out that he left the country this week – missing a debate on the Ukraine plane crash in the process – for a photo opportunity with US President Barack Obama.   

Social media sites lit up with cringeworthy pictures of Mr Miliband posing for ‘selfies’ with celebrities including The Only Way Is Essex star Joey Essex, singer Lily Allen and artist Grayson Perry.

The speech marked the start of a six-week campaign by senior Labour figures designed to reverse the party’s slide in the polls and shape Mr Miliband as a potential future Prime Minister. 

As he attempted to change the terms of political debate around his appearance, Mr Miliband admitted that if he fought the campaign as a ‘photo op contest’ he would not win the General Election.

Food for thought: That bacon sandwich photograph (left) (and Wallace, right, fares no better in his attempt)

Labour
 leader Ed Miliband has struggled to shake off criticism of his public 
image, most notably after he appeared to struggle to eat a bacon 
sandwich during a photo opportunity at New Covent Garden Market

He conceded he was neither ‘square-jawed’ nor ‘chiselled’ and did not look like a politician out of ‘central casting’. Mr Miliband added: ‘I am not trying to win a photo op contest in the next ten months. And I wouldn’t win it if I tried.’ 

David Cameron repeatedly mistook Teesside for Tyneside yesterday – during an interview with Radio Tees.

The
 Prime Minister listed what he thought were the Government’s economic 
achievements in the area, but repeatedly referred to Tyneside.

The
 presenter Lisa McCormick snapped: ‘You keep mentioning the River Tyne. 
That’s not our region, Prime Minister. I’m sorry, we are the River 
Tees.’

The Tyne runs through Newcastle, while the Tees lies 30 miles to the south.

Mr
 Cameron, who was conducting one of half a dozen back-to-back local 
radio interviews from London, replied: ‘I’m sorry, I thought I was 
doing…’ 

Tom Blenkinsop, Labour MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, said it showed Mr Cameron was ‘out of touch’.

And, extraordinarily, he said the changes he wanted to make to the country would take more than two terms of Government – an apparent pitch for three consecutive Labour terms. 

In his speech to Labour supporters in central London, Mr Miliband attempted to present himself as serious and principled compared to Mr Cameron’s ‘superficial’ and image-driven approach.

The photo opportunity, he said, is ‘not where my talents lie – as you may have noticed’. 

He said: ‘I am not from central casting. You can find people who are more square-jawed, more chiselled, look less like Wallace.

‘You could probably even find people who look better eating a bacon sandwich. If you want the politician from central casting, it’s just not me, it’s the other guy.

‘And if you want a politician  who thinks that a good photo is the most important thing, then don’t vote for me. Because I don’t. But here’s the thing: I believe that people would quite like somebody to stand up and say there is more to politics than the photo op. And that culture diminishes our politics.’ 

He said Mr Cameron was ‘a very sophisticated and successful exponent of a politics driven by image’, who had posed with huskies before the election to highlight climate change – but went on to turn his back on green issues.

This week Mr Miliband flew to Washington for a 'brush by' meeting and photo opportunity with Barack Obama

In
 April this year Mr Miliband managed to squeeze into a celebrity selfie 
with TOWIE star Joey Essex, artist Grayson Perry, actress Emma Thompson 
and author Kathy Lette

Mr Cameron said Mr Miliband’s speech proved he was the leader who lacked substance.

‘On a day when our national output has recovered to where it was before the great recession, which was brought to us by Labour, I think it was an extraordinary thing to say, ‘ said the Prime Minister.

Tory chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘If he wants to be taken seriously he should be talking about the economy and how we can secure a better future for our children and grandchildren. Not why he struggles to eat a bacon sandwich.’
