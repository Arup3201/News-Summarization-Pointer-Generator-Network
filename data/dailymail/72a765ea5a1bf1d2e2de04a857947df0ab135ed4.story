Not sure whether to chuckle, feel horrified or jealous of the hordes of Dutch middle-aged people apparently having drug-fuelled orgies, the news got me thinking.

The reason why this story made headlines is age: if it was about horny 20 years olds, we’d yawn and click on something else.

It’s the fact that it’s 45 year olds having rampant sex that makes us sit up and pay attention. (They’re still having sex at that age? Dear God, how disgusting!)

Tracey says that sex in our teens can be exciting but can also be awkward and not quite what it's cracked up to be 

But is it really that shocking?

The answer to this question will be completely skewed by what age and generation you are but at what age do you have the best sex of your life?

Here’s my take on it:

Late teens:

Pros: It’s hit-or-miss, fumbly and lacking in technique but more than makes up for it in ‘firsts’. The first time you’re touched there, your first orgasm - and all this coupled with the first time you fall in love. Hormones are raging, so you feel everything intently and exquisitely.

Cons: Losing your virginity isn’t quite what it’s cracked up to be. Lots of women, especially, feel desperately disappointed by their first time - me included.

Sex is massively hyped and I had high expectations. Plus, I really didn’t have a clue what was going to happen. When my boyfriend moved on top of me, I wondered what the hell was going on. I knew what went where but had no idea people moved while doing it!

Despite the fact that older age cam pose a few health complications, Tracey says that many elderly couples still enjoy regular and satisfying sex 

In your 20s:

Pros: If you’re single and playing the field, you reap all the benefits of single sex. Single sex is all about anticipation: the split second before it happens, the moment before you’re about to kiss/bed the person you’ve been fantasising about for weeks/months/three minutes. You’ve never been with this person before - and the erotic part of the human brain doesn’t half like the ‘newness’ factor.

Your 20s is also often when you experience sexual nirvana: great sex with someone you’re also very much in love with. If you’re balancing electric, erotic sex with lots of soppy stuff, it doesn’t get much better, surely?

Cons: If you haven’t found someone special, casual sex is unlikely to stay sexy long-term because it’s generally selfish: you’re both out for your own pleasure. Even if it’s not that bad, it can still feel pretty empty and pointless lying there with someone you don’t know and don’t particularly want to know.

In your 30s:

Pros: This is the settle down and have kids period. Some women maintain the best sex of their life is during pregnancy; absolutely no-one ever lays claim to having great sex with small kids in the house. Babies have inbuilt sex radars and are guaranteed to cry at the mere hint of a sexy snog or erect penis.

Tracey says that great sex can be have right up until your 70s and even beyond that

Cons: You face a harsh reality: while you’d have killed for sex-on-tap while single, once it’s just a matter of turning over, it isn’t half as appealing. Parenthood strips the will to live, let alone love. Most couples rather sensibly make do with perfunctory sex for the first few years after a newborn.

In your 40s:

Pros: The children need less of your time which has a spin-off. Some couples make a pact to put the effort in and rescue a stale sex life, rediscovering the sex they used to have and more. (In our 40s we’re more confident and likely to speak up about what we really need and want in bed.)

The second outcome is you both decide while you’re well up for more sex but would prefer it wasn’t with each other. Enter the middle-aged Dutch swingers (see above), spreading STI’s willy-nilly and generally behaving like over-sexed adolescents.

Cons: More than half of men aged between 40 and 70 will experience some degree of erectile dysfunction. Men find this most unsettling but for women, it can be a plus. There’s more emphasis on foreplay and oral sex and less focus on penetration.

In your 50s:

Pros: This is when having the right partner and the right attitude is crucial. Around 42% of couples aged 45-55 and married for ten years or more still have sex weekly. The amount you have it and how much you enjoy it, is strongly related to how happy you are with each other. Some find sleeping with the same person forever a negative, others a plus.

Cons: Menopause is a b****ch for lots of women. Low testosterone means loss of desire, weight gain, being too wet in the wrong bits (night sweats), too dry in others (vaginally). Not surprisingly, a lot of women decide to give sex the swerve completely. Others rewrite the rule book and move onto gentler, more intimate sex which turns out to be just as satisfying as the raw, urgent sex of old.

In your 60s:

Pros: Plenty of older people find sex in their later years is the best ever. If you don’t believe me, get a copy of a brilliant book called ‘Better than Ever: Time for Love and Sex’ that challenges many of the myths about sex and ageing.

Cons: Health problems can take their toll but if you’re able to humour each other about ageing, it’s possible to work around potential problems (pillows - to pad, prop and support - become your new favourite sex aid).

In your 70s and beyond:

Pros: Research suggests plenty of people 70-plus rate their sex lives as ‘very satisfying’. The orgasm quota isn’t what it was, but sex is slow, sensual and high on snuggling and cuddling.

Cons: ‘The Wheelbarrow’ might be something used in the garden, rather than attempted in the bedroom, but if you’re still having regular orgasms at this age, I say you win hands down!

Come on then, at what age did you have the best sex - or is it (ahem) about to come?
