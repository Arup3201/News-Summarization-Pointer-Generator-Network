A disturbing video reveals the vicious  training regimes run by a man believed to be a major figure in the seedy world of British dogfighting.

Bodybuilder John Psaila, 49, who calls himself 'Pitbull John', used sticks, steroids and metal collars to ruthlessly train pitbull terriers for illegal fight-to-the-death bouts.

Footage on his mobile phone shows his dogs, Ziggy, Tip and Cruise, struggling against metal chains as they are forced to run on treadmills as part of the 35-day programme.

The father-of-two was jailed for 121 days at Wigan Magistrates' Court after he admitted to 14 animal cruelty charges. He has also been banned from keeping animals for life. 

Psaila, who has a tattoo of a pitbull etched across his back, was caught when RSPCA inspectors raided his home in Abram, near Wigan, Greater Manchester last June after receiving a tip-off.

They discovered one scarred dog being forced to run a treadmill - a technique designed to build up stamina and muscle - in what appeared to be a makeshift training school for fighting dogs.

Weighing scales were used to ensure dogs were at their 'fighting weight' before a meeting and Psaila had 'breaking sticks' to open a dog's jaw when it had a bite hold on another dog in a fight.

There were also home veterinary kits - stocked with steroids, bandages and Psaila's own antibiotics - that he had assembled so as to avoid taking any injured animals to the vet.

One of the dogs, Ziggy, had injuries consistent with dog fighting, the court heard. 

As part of the judge's sentence, two of the dogs are to be destroyed as their training means they could pose a risk to the public.

Buckets and sponges were also found, pictured, which are used during fights when dogs are placed in corners and washed down to stop 'noxious substances' being put on coats to gain advantage

The court heard the investigation was carried out by the RSPCA's Specials Operation Unit. 

RSPCA prosecutor Tony Stock said: 'Organised dog fighting is what it says, a highly organised tight knit fraternity in which people hide their identity behind names, keeping in touch by calls.  

'Treadmills serve to build up stamina and muscle. Breaking sticks, both had bite marks on them and are used to break open a jaw that has a bite hold on another dog in a fight. 

Inspectors also found a 'captive bolt', designed for destruction of animals in slaughterhouses. 

Mr Stock added: 'Ziggy and Tip together with Cruise were kept and trained by the defendant for the purpose of dog fighting.  

'Buckets and sponges were also found which are used during fights when dogs are placed in corners and washed down to stop "noxious substances" being put on coats to gain advantage'.

Psaila had a subscription to a dog fighting magazine that Mr Stocks said was something 'clearly not a normal dog owner would subscribe to'. Above, some of the dog fighting books found in Psaila's home 

Psaila, described as being involved in the most serious dog fighting gangs in the country, also had a subscription to a dog fighting magazine. 

The prosecutor said text messages recovered from Psaila's mobile phone showed he was 'a man banged up in organised dog fighting'.

One reply message from him read 'got mouth but no heart', meaning that the dog he was referring to had refused to fight its opponent due to a 'lack of courage'.

It also emerged Psaila's Facebook page had a number of pictures of dogs including a mocked up image of three grim reapers crowding round a pitbull terrier as it prepared to fight in a boxing ring.

In an interview, Psaila claimed he had been merely keeping the dogs 'in tip-top condition for shows' and claimed Ziggy suffered his when the dogs were fighting among themselves.

Mitigating Psaila, Clare Parrott said her client had kept and bred dogs since the Eighties and had claimed he had acted out of 'desperation' after the collapse of his two retail businesses.

She added: 'He states that over the years, numerous times he was asked if he wanted to get involved in this activity but numerous times he shunned offers over the years. 

'Unfortunately the offer of easy money got the better of him. His daughter said she was "so surprised" and said he had doted upon his animals.'

'There is no evidence that this is something he was doing every single day, they are few and far between. 

'He says he has been desperate and dipped in and out of it. He knows the dogs will be taken. He wants to start afresh. He has showed genuine remorse.'

Psaila was also ordered to pay £600 in costs plus a veterinary bill of £1728.

After the hearing, RPSCA Chief Inspector Ian Briggs said: 'This man was actively involved in the most serious dog fighting gangs across the country. 

'The level of the organisation and his involvement makes it one of the worst cases. He is actually involved in dog fighting at the most serious and organised level.'
