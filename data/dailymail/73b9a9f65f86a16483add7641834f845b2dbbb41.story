The victim of an alleged sexual assault has claimed that Brooklyn Nets star Andray Blatche watched her being attacked from the doorway of his luxury hotel suite.

A 21-year-old female filed a complaint saying that she 
was assaulted by someone at the Four Seasons Hotel in Philadelphia at around 4am on Tuesday.

Blatche, along with two friends, were questioned and released by the Philadelphia Police Department Special Victims Unit. No charges have been brought.

Denials: Brooklyn Nets forward Andray Blatche leaves the Four Seasons in Philadelphia on Tuesday after a woman alleged she was sexually assaulted by another man in his hotel suite

The alleged victim told ABC-6 Action News that Blatche did not sexually assault her but stood in the doorway of his room and watched.

The woman said that 'he was aware the whole time' that she was being assaulted.

Blatche, 26, denied the woman's accusations. He told the New York Post: 'I’m not worried at all. I know everything…when the truth comes out, then everybody will realize what really happened. In the meantime I can’t really have too much comments on it.'

The Nets player had been with friends on Monday night at Delilah's strip club in Philadelphia, celebrating his contract extension with the Brooklyn team. 

Delilah's is described as a 'premiere 
destination for business travelers, celebrities, and uninhibited 
Philadelphians alike and home of the world's most beautiful Showgirls'.

A woman, who is described as a stripper by the Post, allegedly went back with the group to the Four Seasons. She told ABC that she had been drinking but felt like she had been drugged at the club.

The woman called police at around 3.30am to say that she had been assaulted. She was taken to a local hospital to be examined.

Police who searched the hotel suite initially said a date-rape drug appeared to have been found but was later identified as another substance.

In addition to Blatche, two other men, aged 41 and 25, were questioned by police. All three were later released.

Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey said Blatche was among the witnesses interviewed by police on Tuesday.

Ramsey told reporters that preliminary findings of the investigation show Blatche wasn't involved.

Commissioner Ramsey also took the unusual step of publicly questioning a potential rape victim's credibility. He told the New York Times: 'She was so intoxicated. She is not going to be a very good witness.'

After news of the investigation broke, Blatche tweeted: 'Im ok and I didn't do anything jus was n the area when it happened.'

He soon removed the message and instead posted: 'Gettin ready for the game.'

Hours after the attack, Blatche helped the Brooklyn Nets route the Philadelphia 76ers with the final score 109 - 89.

Nets coach P.J. Carlesimo had little patience for questions about Blatche's off-court issues, saying: 'He's been playing well and I expect him to play well today.'

Police were waiting to talk to the woman before deciding whether to file any charges in the case, according to CBS Philly.

A representative for the Four Seasons said, 'We are fully cooperating with the police investigation.'

The Brooklyn Nets released the following statement on Tuesday: 'We are aware of the ongoing police investigation regarding a member of 
the Brooklyn Nets. 

'We will have no further comment until the 
investigation has concluded. All of our players are available for 
tonight's game.'

A representative for the Four Seasons said: 'We are fully cooperating with the police investigation.'
