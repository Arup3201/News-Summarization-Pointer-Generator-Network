Beyonce and Jay-Z have tried it, Natalie Portman's at it, as is songstress Ellie Goulding -- veganism is on the up.

But look out Celebvile, there are some sexy new vegans in town.

Animal rights charity PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) is on the search for the UK's sexiest vegan.

Nominee: Sophia Attwood-Clarke, 23, from Loughborough was one of the finalists

Better luck next time: Byron Higgins, 29, from Colchester, gunned for extra votes with the cunning use of a cute baby prop

After stiff competition, they've whittled it down to eight finalists -- four men and four women. Now it's down to the public to decide who should wear the PETA crown.

The stunning female finalists come from all corners of the British Isles. Jenna McGuinness, 23, is from Glasgow and says, 'I'm passionate about healthy eating and addicted to vego chocolate bars!'.

Sophia Attwood-Clarke, 23, from Loughborough, describes herself as, 'a cat lady, artist, adventurer and soldier in the karma army'.

In the Mancunian corner, Kate Laycy, 33, currently working in London as an actress says, 'I'm an animal loving, green tea obsessed, bikram gal - and a vegan forever!'

Whilst her Dundee Rival, Lisa-Marie Williams, 24, hopes and believes that one day all animals will be treated as equals.

The men -- Byron Higgins, 29, from Colchester; Seth Taggart, 40, from Brighton; Gareth Lloyd, 27, from Oxford; and Matthew Oakes, 26, from Staffordshire -- are all proud vegans and animal rights advocates too.

Public voting is now open on peta.org.uk and will help PETA determine who they should select as the Britain's sexiest vegans.

PETA spokesperson Ben Williamson says: 'Compassion for others is not only a sign of strength but also a big turn-on.

'Everyone who entered this contest is a winner because they know that the best thing that people can do for animals, the planet and their own health is to go vegan.'

According to PETA, vegansim is on the up.

'We've had a huge increase in entries this year and there's definitely been more interest in veganism in the UK,' says Ben.

'Bill Clinton, Jared Leto and Al Gore are all vegan, as well as other celebrities, which may have an influence.'

Mathew Oakes, 26, (left) and Gareth Lloyd, 27, (right) are among the male finalists 

'And this year the first vegan supermarket, currently a success in Germany, will be opening in the UK too.'

'There are not only ethical but environmental benefits too. The livestock sector is the highest contributor to greenhouse gases -- even more than the transport industry.

'So organisations like the UN are now encouraging a shift towards veganism.'

Adopting the 'v' word has also been found to have hugely beneficial effects on our health. 'Food like meat, dairy, eggs and lamb have all been linked to cancer, stroke, heart desease and obesity.'

'Vegans report feeling more energetic and are often lighter.' And judging by these finalists, ditching the meat is great for sex appeal too.

You can vote for your favourite contestants online, one female and one male, to help PETA select the winners.

The two winners will each receive a night for two and lunch at the Lancrigg Vegetarian Country House Hotel in Grasmere, Cumbria, plus a vegan dinner for two at Cumbria's Zeffirellis restaurant.

PETA will choose the winners while taking into account several factors, including vote count and the enthusiasm that entrants demonstrate in promoting their entry and vegan eating. The winners will be announced on 15 April.
