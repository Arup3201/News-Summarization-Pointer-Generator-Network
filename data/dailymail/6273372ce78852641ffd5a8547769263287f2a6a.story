World middleweight champion Gennady Golovkin paid Manny Pacquiao a visit at his training camp as he prepares for his showdown with Floyd Mayweather.

The 32-year-old Kazakh was pictured with the Filipino at the Wild Card Gym in California.

Golovkin is widely regarded as one of the best pound-for-pound fighters in the world alongside Pacquiao and has won all 32 of his professional bouts, 29 by knockout.

Golovkin is also preparing for an upcoming contest when he defends his WBA and WBC interim middleweight belts against Willie Monroe Jnr in Inglewood, California on May 16.

The world middleweight champion stopped Englishman Martin Murray in his previous contest in Monte Carlo in February.

Pacquiao, meanwhile, has stepped up his preparations for his mega fight with Mayweather on May 2 at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas.

After weeks of conditioning work, the Filipino had his first day of sparring on Tuesday in Hollywood.

Pacquiao told ESPN: 'After 13 days of strength and conditioning and boxing drills at Wild Card plus weeks more of working out in the Philippines in February, it was great to finally put on the headgear and spar.

'My sparring partners gave me good work today. They were perfect for testing the strategy Freddie and I have developed to beat Floyd Mayweather. I was very happy with my stamina and speed today.'
