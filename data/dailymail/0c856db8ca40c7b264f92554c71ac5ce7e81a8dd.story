Growth has stalled in the eurozone with Germany’s powerhouse economy slamming into reverse and France grinding to a halt.

There was zero growth for the 18-country bloc in the three months to the end of June, figures showed.

Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, shrank 0.2 per cent in the second quarter of the year, after registering 0.7 per cent growth in the first three months.

The German economy shrunk by 0.2 per cent in three months to end of June, which will be bad news for Chancellor Angela Merkel, while 0.8 per cent growth in Britain has buoyed the Tories 

France, Europe’s second biggest economy, stagnated for the second consecutive quarter as it registered no growth, according to figures yesterday from Eurostat, the EU’s statistics organisation.

Italy, the eurozone’s third largest economy, fell back into recession after shrinking for two consecutive quarters.

Last night economists described the worse-than-expected figures as ‘very worrying’ and said they were also bad news for the UK.

They fear it will be more difficult for the fragile eurozone economies to withstand any fallout from the growing crisis in the Ukraine, including Russian sanctions, and are concerned the eurozone could slide into a triple-dip recession.

A senior Bank of England official described Europe – the UK’s biggest trading partner – as ‘dead in the water’.

Monetary policy committee member David Miles told the BBC: ‘Our single biggest export market has been, I’m tempted to say, dead in the water. It hasn’t been growing at all.

‘And it’s difficult in that environment to see [UK] exports growing very strongly. So the recovery, very welcome as it is, has been a bit dependent on consumer spending.’

Eurostat figures showed that the UK grew by 0.8 per cent in the second quarter, second only to Latvia in the EU.

But experts said the spluttering performance of economies across the eurozone poses a major problem for the Government as it tries to boost exports to cultivate a more balanced recovery.

Growth was flat across the 18 countries of the Eurozone bloc, while the UK economy increased 0.8 per cent

The scale of the challenge was underlined again last week when official figures showed Britain’s trade deficit widened unexpectedly to £9.4billion in June from £9.2billion in May.

The shrinking output of the German economy caught experts off guard. The dramatic fall was partly caused by a mild winter, which led its factories to bring forward production, boosting first quarter output.

France’s flatlining economy will heap further pressure on its president Francois Hollande, who has been criticised for damaging business by introducing a 75 per cent tax for the wealthy.

The French government has admitted it will miss its budget deficit target this year and has cut its forecast for 1 per cent growth in 2014 in half.

Jennifer McKeown, senior European economist at analysts Capital Economics, said: ‘At what should have been an early stage of recovery in the eurozone, the fact that growth has ground to a halt is very worrying.

‘These are key export destinations for the UK so this has to be very bad news.’

Chris Williamson, chief economist at financial research group Markit, said: ‘A stalling of economic growth in the second quarter raises concerns that the euro area is sliding into a triple-dip recession.’
