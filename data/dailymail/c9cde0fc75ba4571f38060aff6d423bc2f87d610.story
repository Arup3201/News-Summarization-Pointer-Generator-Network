Roy Hodgson says he will listen to Brendan Rodgers’ concerns when he picks Daniel Sturridge for England next month and take into account his recovery programme.

But the England manager conceded that the international schedule means he can’t always look after players in the same way the clubs do.

Sturridge will be back in the squad for the Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania and the friendly against Italy, the first time he has trained under Hodgson since suffering a thigh injury in September while on England duty.

Liverpool manager Rodgers subsequently said he was ‘disappointed’ that Sturridge trained when he needed an extra recovery day and said the England manager had assumed that ‘one recovery fits everyone.’

Hodgson claimed England could not be blamed for Sturridge’s injury problem and denied that they work any differently from Liverpool. ‘No we don’t. That’s another myth,’ he said. ‘We also like to give players a second-day recovery when we can. But it’s much less obvious that we can do that because of the shortage of time we get between games.

‘Of course if you have a week between games you can give two days off, you can give three days off if you want. We can’t. But that’s not a particular thing.

'It was unfortunate that Daniel got injured as he did and we were sad about that but he’s had a few injuries since then and I haven’t seen too many people writing about that.

‘The other three muscles injuries he’s picked up? Are they due to England and the way we work? I don’t think so. It’s just one of those things.

‘If I hear he’s having a special programme and needs to do certain things, we’ll take it into consideration. Of course we will.

‘If he’s got a special programme our medical people will know that because they’re in contact with the Liverpool medical people.’
