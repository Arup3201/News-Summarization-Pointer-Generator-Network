A man of 85 has died after the chaotic evacuation of a care home that was closed suddenly because of fears for its residents.

He is understood to have passed away at another home less than 48 hours after he and 24 other residents were moved in freezing conditions in the dark.

Residents of Merok Park, ordered to be shut by the Care Quality Commission, were seen waiting by the front door wrapped in blankets as they were removed with the help of police and paramedics.

Some were carried from their beds in nightclothes, belongings were moved in bin liners, and families complained that they were left with no information about transport for their loved ones.

The home in Banstead, Surrey, described by families of residents as a ‘dump’, is owned by Mauritian businessman Soodressen Cooppen and his wife Maleenee.

Another of their homes, Grantley Court in Sutton, has also since been evacuated on the instructions of council officials.

The death of the former resident of Merok Park has led to calls for the owners to be investigated.

It will also draw attention to conditions in the home and others owned by the Cooppens, and the way the authorities dealt with the evacuation of residents.

A spokesman for the Warrengate Nursing Home in nearby Kingswood, where the man was taken, said the sudden move could have been a shock for him.

The Cooppens, who live in a £2million house in Cheam, own a third care home, Faygate House in Sutton, which was criticised by the inspectorate earlier this year for failing to keep proper records

Zeenat Mehboob Rajan, director of Claremont Care Services, which owns the home, said it was a ‘well-known fact’ that moving elderly people could cause premature death.

He added: ‘Two people were moved here. One is doing well and the other was quite sick, and his death was an expected one.

‘It may have been a few days later that he died if he wasn’t moved, but obviously when you move people it creates shock.’

Mr Rajan said he believed the family were ‘in bereavement’ and would not wish to comment.

It is understood the man is survived by a widow, a son and two daughters, seven grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

He is believed to have died at Warrengate in the early hours of last Thursday, after being moved there in the evacuation on Tuesday.

A post mortem examination is understood to have been carried out and the circumstances of the death are likely to be examined at an inquest.

South East Coast Ambulance Service said an ambulance and a response car were sent to the Warrengate home just after 5.30am on Thursday. Leslie Shields, whose 78-year-old father was one of the residents moved from Merok Park, said the man’s death should be investigated by the police.

The CQC said it carried out a 'comprehensive inspection' of the home on November 28 and December 1 and, after the visit, it was decided that the care facility had to close immediately

It was reported that staff at the care home were working up to 60 hours per week and that they had not been given relevant training. A recent care quality inspection found that residents were being washed in cold water

‘We did warn the care home that moving these elderly residents was a complete mistake, but no one cared,’ he said. ‘We were told that the stress of moving my father would be detrimental to his health, and maybe his life.’

His father, who has dementia, is now in another home. The 53-year-old car mechanic said: ‘I’ve seen animals in better condition than the residents at Merok Park. The care home owners should face criminal charges.

‘You shouldn’t be able to make money on the misery of others.’

Merok Park was closed on the instructions of the CQC after elderly residents were found in unsanitary conditions and discovered to have been forced to wash in cold water by untrained staff.

Surrey Police confirmed uniformed officers assisted with the closure of the home and removing residents

Inspectors found an ‘overpowering’ smell of urine at the home, which charged residents £500 a week for their places.

The home was given a clean bill of health by the watchdog in January, despite numerous complaints from relatives going back years.

The Cooppens, who live in a £2million house in Cheam, own a third care home, Faygate House in Sutton, which was criticised by the inspectorate earlier this year for failing to keep proper records.

Grantley Court was evacuated by Sutton council after an inspectors’ report said the dignity of residents was not respected and some were left in soiled and wet clothing.

Mr Cooppen, 51, and his wife, who is 42, take frequent holidays in Mauritius. On Saturday the Mail published pictures of a lavish party on the island for their daughter’s 18th birthday.

The Daily Mail could not reach the couple for comment.
