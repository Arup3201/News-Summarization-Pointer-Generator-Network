A grieving mother entrapped a ‘heartless’ thief who stole tributes from the grave of her murdered son by placing a tracking device inside  a teddy bear.

Heartbroken Joan Holland was so determined to discover who was stealing the items from her son Andrew’s final resting place that she bought a £200 GPS device and stitched it inside the toy.

Andrew was stabbed to death during a row outside a takeaway when he was 16 in 2007.

Grieving: Joan Holland, 50, caught a thief who was stealing from her murdered son's grave by hiding a tracker inside a teddy bear. Above, Ms Holland at the grave of her son Andrew, who was stabbed to death in 2007

Mrs Holland noticed that objects would
 be missing during her visits to his grave at  St Michael’s churchyard 
near Bolton in Greater Manchester.

She
 said: ‘I’d thought about putting a camera over the grave, but someone 
suggested a tracker. When it went off by sending an alert to my 
daughter- in-law’s laptop, we knew the teddy had been stolen from the 
grave.’

Mrs Holland, who 
traced the bear  to the home of the thief, Andrew Balshaw, said she saw 
items from other people’s graves, such as a wreath and ornaments, in his
 bin.

After his arrest, 
Balshaw, 48, initially claimed he had bought the teddy and found the 
other items, but later pleaded guilty to theft and possessing a small 
amount of cannabis.

Bolton 
Crown Court was told that he had been attacked by other prisoners who 
had discovered the nature of his crime while he was on remand.

Described as ‘callous and heartless’ by the judge in the case, Jeremy Lasker, he was jailed for 12 months.

Mrs Holland wept as sentence was passed and described the devastating effects the thefts had had on her.

She
 said: ‘Since Andrew died, the only comfort I have gained is by going to
 the graveside. I feel so angry someone would take items from his 
grave.’

Lindsay Thomas, prosecuting, told the court Ms Holland's son Martin, 31, had bought the tracker after they arrived at Andrew's gravestone on Mother's Day this year to find it completely empty.

'Clever plan': Today, Ms Holland (pictured with the tracking device), who works as a carer, said she has visited her son's grave every Sunday for the past seven years and was devastated when items started to go missing

They stitched the device into the teddy bear, before leaving it on the grave in St Michael's churchyard in Bolton at around 3pm on April 18.

They were alerted to the bear's theft at around 5pm the next day and called the police, she said.

Officers described Balshaw's flat at as 'Aladdin's cave' filled with a number of missing items, including a porcelain doll and an angel that had vanished from Andrew's grave months earlier.

During a police interview, Balshaw initially claimed he had bought the teddy and found the other items, before later confessing to theft and possessing a small amount of cannabis.

At the time Balshaw stole the toy, he was already on bail over the theft of a bicycle, the court heard.

Recorder Jeremy Lasker yesterday described the Holland family's actions as clever and astute, while deeming the crime 'heartless and callous'.

'The public would be outraged if I did not pass a sentence of imprisonment on you,' he said. 'There is no doubt that this family have suffered severely by what you have done. 

Court case: Yesterday, Balshaw was jailed for 12 months at Bolton Crown Court after pleading guilty to theft

'There is nothing I can say in passing sentence on you that is likely to assuage the grief or upset of the victims.'

Andrew Holland was stabbed to death outside Ashys takeaway in Plodder Lane, Farnworth, on August 17, 2007.

Ms Holland added: 'At least now we have had some justice.'
