Banks may have tightened their lending criteria in recent years but they'd be bending over backwards to loan money to Tom Pavelka.

The Cleveland government worker has the highest credit rating in the entire United States, despite owning eight credit cards and having an outstanding mortgage on his 3,000-square-foot home.

Pavelka, 56, has a credit score of 848 out of 850 and a letter he received from the credit bureau recently announced his rating 'ranks higher than 100 per cent of U.S. consumers.'

But the man, who has no children and lives with his wife of 25 years, Helga, in Westlake, insists he isn't tight with his cash, he's just responsible.

'I don't like being called frugal,' he told told The Plain Dealer. 'I like to spend money. I just do it wisely.'

1. Get a credit card if you don't have one. Having and using a credit card will build your score.

2. Pay down your credit cards. Try to 
get your balances below 30 per cent of the limit on each card or, even 
better, below 10 per cent.

3. Pay your bills on time. Set up automatic payments and be sure to have enough money in your account to avoid overdraft fees.

4. Use your cards lightly. Racking up 
big balances can hurt your score, regardless of whether you pay your 
bills in full each month.

5. Avoid late payments, charge-offs or
collections and if you have any errors in your credit report dispute 
them with the credit bureaus because they can really cost you.

Pavelka, an assistant district director at the Department of Labor's Office of Workers' Compensation in Cleveland, owns two 1960s British sports cars, a 1958 Corvette and four other vehicles.

But he and his wife carpool 16 miles to work so he doesn't have to pay for parking or rack up miles on another car. The couple eat out regularly and collect vintage red wine but they holiday in the U.S.

While his score isn't perfect, it's the most impressive most financial experts have ever encountered.

'I don't know anybody who has a perfect credit score,' Experian director of public education Rod Griffin told The Plain Dealer.

'It's almost impossible. If you use credit and you have debt, there's always some risk you will not be able to repay it.

'You could become ill, you could be 
in an accident that's not your fault. Because there's always some risk 
from things beyond your control that you won't be able to repay the 
debt, you won't have a perfect credit score.'

To get a high credit score, you need to take on debt to show you can responsibly pay it off.

Pavelka has a mortgage with four years left on it and an equity line that he generally uses to buy cars and then pays off.

The couple also have a total of eight credit cards with available credit exceeding $120,000.

He admits having no kids probably helped him get to credit score royalty.

Likes to spend: Tom Pavelka owns seven cars including a 1958 Corvette, similar to the one above, but says he spends his money wisely

But he also swears by a few simple rules including never spending money without knowing when he can pay it back and paying his bills on time.

Pavelka said he has never obsessed about his credit score, and can't remember the last time he checked it or what it was back then.

He only learned of his near-perfect rating after being lured to sign up for a store credit card at hunting store Bass Pro Shop because it would knock $50 off his purchase.

Two weeks later he got a letter revealing his enviable credit score. 'Generally, the higher your score, the more likely you are to be offered better credit terms,' it read.
