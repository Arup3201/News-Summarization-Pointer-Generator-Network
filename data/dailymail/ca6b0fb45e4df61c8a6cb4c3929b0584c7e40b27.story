Brooklyn Democrat Vito Lopez announced today he will resign from the state assembly next month - but still plans on running for city council in November

An embattled New York lawmaker who allegedly inappropriately touched female aides and expressed interest in sleeping with a 14-year-old intern resigned from office today.

Vito Lopez, who previously ran the Democratic Party in Brooklyn, said he'll give up his seat in the state assembly next month - but claims its only because he wants to run for the city council, and not because of the damning allegations.

'I have made no secret that I intend to run for New York City Council in November, which requires me to resign my current term,' Lopez, 71, said.

'Nevertheless, because the citizens of my district voted me back into office last November by an overwhelming majority, I feel obligated to serve out this session of the Assembly,' he wrote.

But his announcement wasn't good enough for some.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo, also a Democrat and potential presidential contender in 2016, demanded Lopez leave public life immediately.

'Vito Lopez should not spend another day in office, let alone a whole month,' Cuomo said, according to the New York Post.

'He should resign effective immediately and if he does not, he must be expelled.'

Lopez's announcement comes one day after a damning report of his pervy shenanigans was released.

Lopez bombarded eight female aides with orders to massage him, wear skimpy clothing and spend the night in hotels with him - but State Assembly officials let him get away with it, the report said.

He told one woman he was dying from his cancer and 'needed' her while forcing her to feel the tumors on his neck, shoulder and armpit.

One aide told how Lopez forced her to 
massage his hand while he was driving in Atlantic City - even though she
 told him she had been raped, was crying and said she felt 
uncomfortable.

Another contracted conjunctivitis after the Brooklyn Democrat made her put drops into his eye, while he demanded that aides write complimentary letters and text messages to and about him.

He was also accused of saying he found a 14-year-old intern so 'sexy' that he wished he lived in a state where it was legal to sleep with underage girls.

Two of the women secretly recorded their encounters with the Assemblyman, who faced a criminal probe into his actions.

The aides feared that their careers would be ruined by Lopez if they spoke up. Those who gave in were handed raises and promotions, while those who resisted faced bullying, reports the NY Daily News.

Lopez will not face charges in Brooklyn, it was announced yesterday, though it is not known if he may face criminal investigations in other places where offenses are said to have taken place.

Two reports released yesterday, by a special prosecutor and the Ethics Commission, said that Assembly speaker Sheldon Silver and the Assembly's lawyers failed to act to stop Lopez.

'Money flow and our desire to keep this away from media scrutiny 
complicates the resolution of this matter,' wrote Bill Collins, a senior 
Assembly lawyer, in one email in the report.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo wants Lopez to resign immediately or face expulsion from the Assembly

The report accused senior staffers of failing to investigate the allegations, first made by two women in December 2011 and January 2012, and failing to refer them to the Assembly ethics committee.

Instead, the women received a $103,000 taxpayer settlement, bound by a secrecy clause.

They were contacted by Assembly lawyers to remind them of the secrecy clause when Lopez's behavior was reported later in the year.

Complaints from two more women, Victoria Burhans and Chloe Rivera were reported to the Assembly Ethics Commission, which led to Lopez's conduct being made public.

Silver then stripped Lopez of his leadership positions in the Assembly.

Lopez's behavour was not tackled by Assembly leaders, who were criticised for being too interested in protecting their reputation than investigating the claims

In a statement, Victoria Burhans and 
Chloe Rivera said: 'Albany’s culture is one in which young women are 
often mistreated and bad behavior by powerful men is condoned and 
covered up.

'We hope that the Commission’s findings will lead to much needed reform.'

Their attorney Kevin Mintzer said: 'The commission’s findings confirm that Vito Lopez is a serial sexual harasser and that he has repeatedly violated the law.

'Had the speaker and his staff fulfilled their legal and ethical obligations, Ms. Burhans and Ms. Rivera would never have been subject to Mr. Lopez’s outrageous conduct.'

In a statement, Lopez denied the 'salacious and sensational claims', reports the New York Times.

He said: 'Should there ever come a time when Mr. Lopez is actually afforded the fundamental rights supposedly allowed everyone, the truth will finally be told.

Special prosecutor Dan Donovan, who is also the Staten Island District Attorney, called his findings on Lopez 'alarming'

'There is an all-out war against an ailing senior member.'

Special prosecutor Dan Donovan, the Staten Island district attorney, said the findings of his report were 'alarming'.

'The chief concern of those in the Assembly was mitigating the Assembly’s damages,' he said.

'That goal outweighed any interest in investigating or disciplining Assembly Member Lopez or in preventing similar occurrences in the future.'

'Lopez engaged in a pervasive pattern of abuse of public office and resources, not for personal financial gain, but to indulge his personal whims and desires,' wrote the Ethics Commission.

The commission found Lopez guilty of at least three violations of the state’s Public Officers Law. He could be fined as much as a $10,000, but any penalties will be decided by a joint Senate-Assembly panel.

The Assembly’s Standing Committee on Ethics is to decide whether any further action, including censure of expulsion, will be taken against Lopez.
