Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has called for the establishment of an independent panel to help stamp out diving and to retrospectively ban those found guilty.

Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho this week spoke out over what he saw as a 'clear campaign' against the Barclays Premier League leaders after midfielder Cesc Fabregas was cautioned by referee Anthony Taylor for simulation in the match at Southampton, when the player looked to have in fact been tripped by defender Matt Targett in the penalty area.

It is not the first time this season Chelsea have found themselves at the centre of a diving storm.

Wenger makes a point to an official, and has called on diving decisions to be taken out of referees' hands

Forwards Diego Costa and Willian were both booked for supposedly taking a tumble in the win over Hull, while on Boxing Day, the West Ham manager Sam Allardyce accused Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic of going down 'looking for a penalty'.

Wenger - who had a touchline bust-up with Mourinho during Arsenal's defeat at Stamford Bridge in October - quipped he 'very much' felt sorry for the supposed campaign against Chelsea players.

However, the French manager agrees something must be done to eradicate the trend of those looking to win an unfair advantage.

Mourinho and Wenger have had differences but the Frenchman has sympathised with his opposite number

'I am against diving. We should punish after the game. The problem will be to decide when it was obvious diving or not. That is a big issue and sometimes it is not obvious,' said the Arsenal boss, who takes his side to Southampton on New Year's Day.

'Yes (there should be a panel), and the most suited to this are people who have an experience in the game, and (then) to punish only obvious cases, but not mixed ones.

'Naming (those guilty) alone doesn't work, you have to suspend the players. (How long should the ban be?) I don't know. It depends.

'I am not a specialist in this kind of thing, but the only way that the players will stop doing it, is if they feel they can get punished.

'Is it Arsenal, or Manchester United, or Liverpool or Chelsea? It is  the same for everybody.'

Arsenal, of course, are not immune to accusations of simulation. Robert Pires infamously took a tumble against Portsmouth which resulted in a controversial penalty during the Gunners' Invincibles campaign of 2003-04, while striker Eduardo was initially banned by UEFA for diving when winning a spot-kick in the Champions League qualifier against Celtic in August 2009, which was eventually overturned on appeal.

Wenger accepts sometimes such instincts are part of a footballer's make-up.

He said: 'It is difficult for me to judge what's happening anywhere else on that front, but you can never really meet a manager who says he is in favour of diving anyway.

'We had them, with Pires, with Eduardo. It is down to the players.

'(But) even if you talk to the players, the guys who have that in them, they will do it in the game. It is just coincidence.' 

However, Hull City manager Bruce was not convinced by Wenger's suggestion of a panel, despite insisting that some action needs to be taken. 

Bruce claims players diving threatens the honesty of the Premier League that makes it admired across the world. 

Steve Bruce labelled Gary Cahill's fall against his Hull City team as like 'something out of Swan Lake'

The Hull boss isn't sure that a panel is the way ahead, but believes action must be taken against divers

Last month the Hull boss compared a Gary Cahill dive against his side to 'something out of Swan Lake', but admits it can be tough to differentiate between dives and fouls with some players.

Bruce said: 'It's very difficult for referees when you have people like [Eden] Hazard and Willian, who are genuinely quick and take you on with a low centre of gravity - the slightest tap can take them over.

'But when you see a blatant dive, I think you have to take action. The reason why the Barclays Premier League is the league that it is, is for its honesty, its integrity and ferocity.

'You must remember that people enjoy the honesty of the Premier League all over the world. We can't make it like every other league - it's a different culture.

'I'm not so sure about a panel, but we have to start taking action against it.'
