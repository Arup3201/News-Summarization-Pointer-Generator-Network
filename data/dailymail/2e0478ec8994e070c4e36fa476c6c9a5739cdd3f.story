Dental nurse Ravinder Kaur was accused of lacing her practice manager's coffee with Mercury. She walked free from court today

A dental nurse accused of poisoning her boss with mercury after she had been fired days before walked free from court today.

Ravinder Kaur's case was dropped by the CPS when two separate juries failed to reach verdicts.

Kaur, 35, was said to have laced practice manager Laura Knowles’ coffee with the toxic metal after being handed her final written warning three days previously.

Ms Knowles, 37, had to be rushed to hospital with stomach cramps, nausea, and dizziness after drinking the noxious drink which was ‘slimy like an oyster’.

Ms Knowles initially thought her colleague had spat in the coffee, she said in court.

But when her stomach was x-rayed, doctors found small pieces of Mercury inside.

Fortunately, she suffered no permanent effects from the poisonous chemical.

Kaur, who worked at Shams Moopen Dental Practice in Shefford, Bedfordshire, did not get on with her colleagues, the court heard.

She had been disciplined twice by Ms 
Knowles. Three days before the incident, Ms Knowles had told her off for leaving a patient unattended in the dental chair to go on her lunch break.

But today, the CPS dropped the case after two separate trials in which juries failed to return a verdict on a charge of administering a noxious substance.

Last week a jury of eight women and four men deliberated for 11 hours and ten minutes before they were discharged.

The case, at Blackfriars Crown Court, was a retrial after a jury also failed to reach a verdict in May last year.

Robin Miric, for the CPS, said: ‘The long and short of it is that the Crown have decided they don’t wish to proceed further in this matter.’

He said that it was only in 'exceptional' circumstances that the CPS would make more than three attempts to convict.

Kaur, who began working at the practice in November 2011, claimed she had been framed for the poisoning, which happened in 2012, by her colleagues.

‘I believe I’ve been framed’, Kaur said. ‘I was shocked and I still am.

‘I’m proud to stand here today, just to stand here, to be here and battle for my life.

‘This concerns my liberty, my whole life. My career has gone down, I won’t be back in dentistry, it has been an emotional trauma for me.

‘I’ve been publicised everywhere, my family and friends have suffered, I can say I haven’t had a good night’s sleep for two years.'

Mrs Knowles had just returned to work
 after the death of her father and accepted the drink from Kaur, known 
as Ravi, who had moments earlier offered her boss her condolences.

She told jurors it took a 'considerable 
amount of time' - about 15 minutes - for Kaur to make the coffee, with 
the nurse claiming it was because she had to change the water in the 
kettle.

Ms Knowles said that she realised after a few gulps that something was wrong with her drink.

She told the jury that the coffee was ‘slimy like an oyster’ and that when she tipped the remainder away in the sink ‘metal blobs’ were left by the plughole.

Colleagues described Ms Knowles as panicking and ‘white as a ghost’ when she realised what had happened.

Kaur told jurors she left the kettle to boil before heading to surgery, where she saw dentists Dr Kunal Shah, Dr Angela Darshini and nurse Dakina Patel.

‘I went to the staff room and started preparing the coffee, there was no water in the kettle so I prepared to put water in there and had it on to boil’, Kaur said.

‘I put one teaspoon of granules in from the jar, one teaspoon of sugar, two teaspoons of Coffee-Mate then poured the contents into the mug.

‘I left the kettle to boil and went to the contamination room where I saw Dakina and asked if she wanted a drink, she said ‘no thank you Ravi’.

‘I asked Dr Darshini if she wanted a cup of coffee out of courtesy, she said ‘no thank you Ravi’.

Kaur added that she also offered a hot drink to Dr Shah and again offered Dr Darshini a cup of coffee before she returned to the staff room.

‘I just poured the water, stirred it and that was it, gave it to Ms Knowles and went to surgery one’.

Kaur from Bedford, denied administering a noxious substance with intent to annoy, injure or aggrieve.
