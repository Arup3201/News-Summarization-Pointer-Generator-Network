Do you live in Scotland? You're blessed with bigger breasts, according to the latest research.

Scottish girls are on average a 34DD - that's two cup sizes bigger than their 34C English neighbours.

Welsh women came out with the smallest average cup size at 34B, while Irish ladies measured in at 34C, the same as the English.

Inverness came out on top, with the average bra size coming in at a 36F, whereas Methyr Tydfil has a more petite bra size average at 34A.

The research reveals that Northern English women are more likely to have bigger boobs - with the average Northern lady wearing a D cup.

Northern towns to top the 
biggest breast poll are Liverpool, Leeds, Aberdeen and Glasgow, while 
southern towns are at the lower end of the spectrum.

Women in Portsmouth, where the average cup size is 34A, came bottom of the poll.

A spokesperson for Debenhams Lingerie, who commissioned the research, said: 'We have seen a dramatic difference in Scottish bust sizes vs. the rest of the UK, our fuller bust ranges have been particularly popular with Scots.'

The research by Debenhams also showed that 63 per cent of women are wearing the wrong size bra.

The retailer sells on average 10,000 bras per week which means worryingly around 6,000 bras are being bought in the incorrect size for the wearer.

The research also shows that only 21 per cent of women have been fitted for a bra in the last 2 years and an alarming 37 per cent of women have never had a bra fit.

Top ten: Women from Newcastle, like Cheryl Cole, left, are a 34D and came in sixth place in the top ten biggest bus regions, and Manchester, came in seventh place, where ladies like Helen Flanagan, right, are a 32D

Size small: Welsh women, like Katherine Jenkins, left, came out with the smallest average cup size at 34B, while English ladies, like Cara Delevingne, measured in at 34C
