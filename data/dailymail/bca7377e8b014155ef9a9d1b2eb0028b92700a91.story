Suspect: Ian John Bennett, who was detained as his father Douglas was taken to a nearby hospital, where he died of head injuries

A British tourist has been arrested on suspicion of killing his 69-year-old father during a fight at a Spanish holiday camp.

The
 45-year-old, named locally as Ian John Bennett, was detained as his 
father Douglas was taken to a nearby hospital, where he died of head 
injuries.

Mr Bennett senior 
was allegedly attacked in the early hours of Friday morning at the 
Castell Montgri campsite near the town of Estartit, on the Costa Brava 
north of Barcelona, where he had been staying in a mobile home with his 
wife Gloria and his son, all from Chard in Somerset.

Family
 and neighbours are stunned and say the father and son had such a loving
 relationship they have no idea how any fight could have occurred.

Douglas’s
 brother Bob, 61, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Doug and Ian were so close 
it was unreal. I have no idea what could have sparked this. I’m 
absolutely speechless.’

Police
 were called by a campsite security guard on Friday morning. At the time
 Mr Bennett senior was still alive but unconscious.

He was taken to Josep Trueta Hospital in nearby Girona but failed to emerge from a coma and died shortly after being admitted.

An
 autopsy was due to take place yesterday to investigate suspicions that 
he died from a punch to the head or possibly from a head injury 
sustained while falling.

According to local reports the father and son had a drunken row, which escalated into a fist fight.

Douglas’s
 brother Bob said the family had had its difficulties and that he and 
his brother had not been in contact, but he could not imagine any reason
 why Ian would physically fight with his father.

He
 said: ‘I nursed our mother Hilda until she died in 2011 but Doug never 
helped at all. He let her down in the past and we disagreed about that. 
Though none of that would have had any bearing I can think of on what 
has happened.

‘He was still my brother and I’m very sad to hear about his death.

‘I
 don’t know whether it might be relevant or not but Ian was very ill 
about 20 years ago when he had some sort of mental breakdown.’

Another
 sibling of Doug’s, younger sister Valerie, 47, added: ‘All we know is 
Doug is dead and Ian has been arrested. I’m stunned.’

In an article in the Sunday Mirror, Shaun Jackson, who lives two doors from ­Mr Douglas’s home, said: 'Ian is a lovely bloke and in all my time I’ve never seen any arguing so I would put my money on this being a horrible accident.'

The 66-year-old added: 'You could never get away with just a quick chat with Doug – he was a very chatty man.

'He was a gentle man, very kind, thoughtful and knowledgable. They’re a very close family.'

His wife Gwyneth said that when she had last seen Ian on Wednesday, he had spoken of how excited he was to be going on holiday.

She added the family were very close and he regularly visited his parents with his own children.

The victim was found in what is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Spain

Another tearful neighbour of Douglas’s, who did not wish to be named, said: ‘I 
just cannot believe it. We were told there had been a fight between Doug
 and Ian. It would be so totally out of character for both of them. 
They’re a very close, quiet family.

‘Doug
 was a very gentle guy. He kept himself to himself and loved looking 
after the birds in his aviary. He was passionate about them.’

The neighbour said he and his son Ian, who both worked as builders and lived a mile apart, had a very friendly relationship.

She
 said: ‘The two of them got on very well. They would go out for a drink 
together at the weekend and were always laughing and joking with one 
another.

‘I just cannot think of anything which would lead to a row, let alone punches being thrown. They just weren’t like that.’
