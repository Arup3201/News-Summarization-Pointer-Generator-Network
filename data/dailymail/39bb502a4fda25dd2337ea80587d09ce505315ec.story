Feeling fed up because your wife always has the last word in an argument? Here’s something that might help you reverse the trend.

Agreeing with everything their wives say only makes husbands miserable, according to scientists – so much so that their study had to be halted because the men involved became so unhappy.

Yet it made their wives happier – although only slightly.

Study: Agreeing with everything their wives say only makes husbands miserable, according to scientists - so much so that their study had to be halted because the men involved became so unhappy

For the study, published in the British Medical Journal, a group of husbands had to agree with every opinion and request expressed by their wives without complaint, even if they thought they were wrong.

The researchers, from the University of 
Auckland in New Zealand, found that the men’s quality of life dipped 
from seven out of ten to three out of ten in only 12 days.

In fact, the impact was so ‘severe’ the 
study had to be abandoned. And despite the power they wielded, the 
women’s happiness increased only slightly, from eight to 8.5. 

The study said: ‘It seems that being right is a cause of happiness, and agreeing with what one disagrees with is a cause of unhappiness.

‘The results of this trial show that the availability of unbridled power adversely affects the quality of life of those on the receiving end.

‘The study had to be stopped after 12 days as the result of a severe adverse outcome - this being that the male participant found the female participant became increasingly critical of everything he did.’

The researchers added: ‘Many people in the world live as couples, and we believe that it could be harmful for one partner to always have to agree with the other.

‘However, more research is needed to see whether our results hold if it is the male who is always right.’
