'TV comedy is a disaster': Triple-Bafta winning writer John Lloyd, who's lent his talents to Blackadder, Spitting Image, QI and Not The Nine O'Clock News

The creator of Blackadder has blasted the BBC’s ‘unfunny’ modern comedies, warning that audiences will desert its channels unless it learns to make people laugh.

John Lloyd, 62, who is responsible for a string of hits including Spitting Image, QI and Not The Nine O’Clock News, said the corporation has to find new creative talents.

He said: ‘What will sink the corporation is nothing to do with “do people trust it, is the licence fee too much?” Nobody gives a two penny worth about the licence fee, not really.

‘But they really care if the comedy isn’t funny. Then they just won’t go there anymore and that is what will sink it.

'Everybody will be jolly sorry when there is no BBC any more. I am going to leave the country.'

Mr Lloyd was speaking at the launch of the latest series of the South Bank Show on Thursday.

The long-running programme, which is hosted by Melvyn Bragg, moved to Sky Arts two years ago after it was axed by ITV.

He will be interviewed in the first episode about his hugely successful career, which has brought him three Baftas for some of the best loved comedies on television.

The producer said BBC commissioners were once willing to give talents like his an opportunity to shine, but are now too risk averse to produce great shows.

He said: ‘Comedy is a disaster on television, it’s more acute in comedy than in anything else because so few people know how to do it.

‘Any actor will tell you comedy is the most difficult thing to do. It’s not to me, because it’s what I do.

‘I’ve done it for 40 years and I’ve watched people do it. There are hardly any producers in the country who really know how to consistently produce comedy.’

Comedy classic: Blackadder Goes Forth is one of the iconic series to which Mr Lloyd has contributed

Sharp satire: Mr Lloyd also contributed to Spitting Image, which lampooned such politicians as Margaret Thatcher

He added: ‘We used to be brilliant at 
[television comedy], the best in the world , same is true of 
advertising, we aren’t any more.

‘There
 are always great things but we’ve lost that knack. I used to be given 
the opportunity. Blackadder was put out on BBC at prime time, even 
though it was a mess.

‘Now 
it has to be premièred on BBC3, and now it’ll be online which nobody 
will ever see and I do think, especially at the BBC, if the BBC is doing
 its news properly, its comedy properly, it doesn’t have to worry about 
anything else. And that is what will sink the BBC.’

Latest effort: Panel quiz QI, featuring Alan Davies and Stephen Fry, is Mr Lloyd's first new TV series in 14 years

Mr Lloyd said the only ‘genius’ comedy
 writing now working in television is producer Jon Ploughman, whose hits
 include Absolutely Fabulous, Little Britain and Twenty Twelve.

But he said BBC commissioners lack any creativity, meaning his talents are under-appreciated by the Corporation.

Triple-Bafta winner John Lloyd is currently presenter of BBC Radio4's comedy panel quiz The Museum of Curiosity.

With a broadcast career spanning four decades, he has created and produced some of the BBC and ITV's most-recognisable series, including The News Quiz, The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy and Spitting Image.

But he earned most plaudits for period sit-com Blackadder, earning gongs from the British Academy for its original series in 1987 and the First World War-based Blackadder Goes Forth in 1989.

He also won a Bafta in 1980 for his work on Not The Nine O'Clock News.

Since 1987, Mr Lloyd has worked on and off as a director of television adverts. His first new TV series for 14 years, QI began in 2003 and is now on its 11th series.

Author or co-author of 20 books, he was  given a CBE in the 2011 New Year Honours for services to broadcasting.

He said: ‘Jon Ploughman should not have to argue or pitch to anybody, people should go to him on their knees saying “What would you like to do next, how soon can we have it, how much money would you like?”.

‘He’s a man with great integrity and honour and talent. But no, he’s treated like any w***** who’s been flown in from Middlesbrough saying I’ve got 3,000 hits on YouTube, I’d like an interview.

'It’s all gone completely bent out of shape.’  

Shane Allen, the BBC's Controller of Comedy Commissioning, called Mr Lloyd's criticisms an 'insult'.

'I don't recognise John Lloyd's gloomy summation that all modern comedy is a thorough-going disaster,' he said.

'It's an insult to the talented comedy writers and performers behind many high rating, much loved shows. The BBC is rightfully incredibly proud of its unparalleled comedy heritage, which continues in abundance to this day. 

'From recent award-winning hits such as Mrs Brown’s Boys, Miranda and Outnumbered on BBC1 to Rev, The Trip to Italy, W1A, Count Arthur Strong and Inside No 9 on BBC2; Him & Her, Uncle, Bad Education and Cuckoo on BBC3 and The Life of Rock With Brian Pern and Up the Women on BBC Four, these gems are just a snapshot of what BBC comedy offers across its television channels, not to mention all the multi-award-winning radio comedy including Just a Minute, The News Quiz, The Now Show, Baggage and Cabin Pressure to name but a few.

'We’re sorry if Mr Lloyd doesn’t enjoy any of these comedies, but fortunately millions of other BBC viewers and listeners do and we wish him and his team continued success making QI with us.'
