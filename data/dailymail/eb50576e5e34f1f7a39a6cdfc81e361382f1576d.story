Dramatic video has revealed the moment a corrections officer smacked a suspect's head against a brick wall - leaving him with a bloody injury that needed stitches.

Officer Charles Broaderick, 41, was arrested, charged with assault and locked up for just 13 minutes following the attack on James Duckworth at the Marion County Jail in Florida on October 8.

Broaderick and two other officers questioning Duckworth, who had been arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence, claimed after the incident that the had been combative and needed to be restrained.

Authorities launched an investigation and concluded that Broaderick crossed the line and broke the law, WKMG reported.
