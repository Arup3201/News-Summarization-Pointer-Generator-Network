Pupils at one secondary school in Britain will undergo fitness training every day in an effort to tackle childhood obesity.

Students will be taught to squat when picking up a football and lunge when tying up shoelaces so that a positive relationship with exercise is fostered - even in children who don't like sport.

Ashwell Academy, in Hull, East Yorkshire, will become the first to introduce a specially-designed anti-obesity programme into its curriculum.

Pupils at one British secondary school will undergo fitness training every day as part of a new independent programme which aims to tackle childhood obesity

From January next year, students will spend a total of three and a half hours per week doing some form of physical exercise - 75 per cent more than the national average.

The frequency of PE lessons will increase from one per week to daily activities with pupils performing exercises such as squats, press-ups, lunges and burpees.

Pupils who buy school dinners will also be encouraged to plump for a healthier option that contains less fat, salt and additives in an attempt to tackle Britain's £5.1 billion epidemic.

The news comes after doctors recently called for an emergency taskforce to be set up to tackle childhood obesity.

They warned that an entire generation will be 'destroyed' by a diet of junk food and sugary drinks unless urgent action is taken.

In an open letter to the Chief Medical Officer for England, Professor Dame Sally Davies, the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) and 11 partner organisations said a national Child Obesity Action Group (COAG) should be formed as 'a matter of urgency'. 

It has been devised with a view of helping teachers to incorporate simple but more structured fitness training into and around traditional, curriculum-based PE lessons.

Pupils are taught to squat, for example, and encouraged to do so when picking-up a football.

This is more beneficial to the leg and back muscles than simply bending-over from the hip.

They are also taught to twist correctly when playing netball, and to lunge when tying their shoelaces.

The exercises are said to be particularly effective because they are also used everyday school life - when picking up a pen, for instance.

This means that youngsters who do not have an active interest in sport or PE still benefit from basic fitness.

Latest figures show many children are already obese by the time they reach secondary school. 

Almost a third of 10 to 11-year-olds and more than a fifth of four to five-year-olds were overweight or obese.

Today's independent  initiative to introduce daily exercise in schools, called the Schools and National Anti-Obesity Program (SNAP), will be incorporated into the Academy's curriculum on January 6, 2015, and will run for a trial period of six weeks.

If this is a success then the program will continue until 2018.

Its aim - to fight childhood obesity and support pupils' wellbeing by giving them a 'positive and purposeful experience' with exercise - is nothing new.

But unlike existing schemes, SNAP is designed to be integrated into the curriculum, rather than run in conjunction with it.

If the trial at Ashwell Academy is successful, SNAP looks set to roll out in schools across the UK next year.

Other schools, including Headington, an exclusive girl's school in Oxford, and Longhill Primary School in Hull, East Yorks., have already expressed an interest. 

Mike Birkinshaw, headteacher at Ashwell Academy, said: 'We are keen to introduce a better standard of physical education into our curriculum while being aware that our students' health and wellbeing generally should also remain a priority.

'We have already introduced healthier lunch options to tackle obesity, but it isn't enough by itself.

'Children need to be more active as inactivity results in obesity and other health issues that can continue into adulthood.

'As a school we feel that we have a duty of care to do all we can to safeguard our pupils against the growing problem of childhood obesity and believe that SNAP will align perfectly with our aims.'

According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), childhood obesity is one of the most 'serious public health challenges of the 21st Century'.

In the UK, almost a third of 10 to 11 year olds and more than a fifth of 4 to 5 year olds are either obese or overweight, according to figures from the National Child Measurement Programme 2012/13.

But despite obesity being largely preventable, SNAP's creator, Daniel Fallon says schools have been 'generally unaware' of the 'straightforward' measures that can be put in place to curb it at a grassroots level.

Mr Fallon, a recently retired Navy Petty Officer, drew on his 13 years as a fitness instructor and clinical exercise specialist to create a program specifically designed for schools.

It has been devised with a view of helping teachers to incorporate simple but more structured fitness training into and around traditional, curriculum-based PE lessons.

In an open letter to the Chief Medical Officer for England sent in September, Professor Dame Sally Davies, the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) and 11 partner organisations said a national Child Obesity Action Group (COAG) should be formed as 'a matter of urgency'. 

Latest figures show many children are already obese by the time they reach secondary school.

18.9 per cent of children in Year 6 aged 10 to 11 were obese and a further 14.4 per cent were overweight.

Of the children in Reception aged four to five, latest figures suggest 9.3 per cent were obese and another 13.0 per cent were overweight.

In total almost a third of 10 to 11-year-olds and more than a fifth of four to five-year-olds were overweight or obese. 

Pupils are taught to squat, for example, and encouraged to do so when picking-up a football.

This is more beneficial to the leg and back muscles than simply bending-over from the hip.

They are also taught to twist correctly when playing netball, and to lunge when tying their shoelaces.

The exercises are said to be particularly effective because they are also used everyday school life - when picking up a pen, for instance.

This means that youngsters who do not have an active interest in sport or PE still benefit from basic fitness.

SNAP - described as a world first - is sold on licence, and affiliate schools receive training workshops for teachers and teaching assistants, instructional handbooks, illustrated text books for students, and video support.

Schools are then free to integrate SNAP's recommendations as they see fit.

Hull's Ashwell Academy, which specialises in behavioural difficulties, is the first school to sign up to carry out SNAP.

According to NHS figures, 19 per cent of children in East Yorkshire and Northern Lincolnshire are obese or 'dangerously overweight'.

Headteacher Mike Birkinshaw added: 'SNAP offers a stimulating and fun way to increase the frequency - and, by a small margin, the length - of physical education classes and engage with young people regardless of whether they are into sports or not.

'We look forward to trialling the programme in January 2015 and based on the pupil feedback and results, incorporating it into our curriculum on a long-term basis.'

Mr Fallon, SNAP's creator, completed three tours of duty in the Middle East, Africa and Mediterranean before retiring from the Navy  last month. 

He said: 'It is a widely reported fact that there is concern about the state of PE in schools, however there has not been a credible and cost-effective alternative to existing curriculum guidelines.

'SNAP isn't about transforming schools into boot camps, but rather a method of introducing simple and straightforward exercises into school's current PE lessons.'

Pupils at Ashwell Academy in Hull will undergo fitness training every day

@highlight

It is hoped this will cut childhood obesity and help children enjoy sport

@highlight

Students will be taught moves they can use in their normal day

@highlight

These include squatting when picking up a football and a lunge to tie laces

@highlight

Designed this way so that pupils who 'don't like sport' can use the move 

@highlight

From January, students will spent 3.5 hours a week doing exercise

@highlight

May be rolled out to other schools across the country if feedback is good
