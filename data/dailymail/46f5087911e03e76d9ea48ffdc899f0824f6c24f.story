As fresh faced children who murdered their father as he slept in a chair, Derek and Alex King caught the nation's attention in 2001.

But now, after spending a third of their lives behind bars, the brothers who were found guilty of murder when they were 12 and 13 are hoping for a more positive future.

After years of being moved between foster homes and being occasionally cared for by their father, Terry, at a Florida home that had no power, the King brothers' main ambition is stability and a family of their own they told People magazine.

'I'm trying to figure out what a typical
 family is,' Derek, now 25, said.

The restaurant worker who is saving money so he can finish college, was convicted of killing his father with a baseball bat when he was 13, while his younger brother, then aged 12, egged him on.Â 

The brothers, who set fire to their family home after killing their father, don't like to talk about the past, but both accept responsibility for it.

Derek, who is only now learning how to build relationships, told People he is keen to get married and settle down.

'My dream is to have a family,' the young man, who after his release in 2009 was left baffled by the changes in the world, said.

'I'd never heard of Facebook,' he said, adding that in prison he had turned to the Harry Potter children's books for inspiration.

The 25-year-old said he could relate to Harry Potter's dismal family life and added that like that character: 'I was a kid who finds he really is special and has things to offer.'

His brother, Alex, who was accused of suggesting that Derek killed their father, also struggled with life on the outside.

He is currently back in prison after violating his parole and leaving the scene of an accident in 2011.

But, like his brother, the 24-year-old who loves to study math and microbiology, is keen to live a simple, quiet life.

On trial: The boys' court case gripped the nation as the youngsters were found guilty of killing their father

Accused: Ricky Chavis, pictured in court, was found guilty of accessory after the fact of murder

'I don't need luxury' he told People. 'I like creature comforts: a nice couch, a flat-screen TV.'

He added that 'being around others motivates me to do right,' and is looking forward to his release so he can be reunited with his girlfriend in California.

Alex had a little extra help settling into life outside the prison walls after journalist Kathryn Medico welcomed him into her family, and acted like a surrogate mother to him when he was first released.

She met Alex when she was researching a book on the brothers' crime, and soon started visiting him regularly and supporting him.

Mrs Medico said while she was devastated when she missed the chance to hear him give his valedictory speech at his prison high school graduation, the teenager was just excited to have someone to celebrate with.

'He
 had so many disappointments in his life that it didn't matter I wasn't 
there for the speech,' she told People. 'It mattered that I was the family 
there and meeting everyone.'

While they were in prison the boys had no contact, but after their release they were were able to spend time together, and both are keen to prove to their supporters that they will do something positive with their life, Today reported.

Before killing their father both boys had a difficult upbringing. They had been abandoned by their drug-addict mother and had been raised separately in a succession of foster homes.

Guilty: Derek and Alex were sentenced to prison for killing their father in 2001

It was during a brief moment of living together again at their father's home, that the boys met convicted child molester Ricky Chavis, who was accused at the trial of manipulating the youngsters.

At their trial, the convicted child molester was accused of taking an inappropriate interest in Alex.

The boy testified in court that he and Chavis had been having oral sex but the court deemed there wasn't enough evidence and Chavis was acquitted of molesting the child.

However, he was sentenced to 35 years in prison after being found guilty of being an accessory to murder and tampering with evidence.

The King brothers say Chavis gave them attention and treats they didn't get at home. 'We looked up to Ricky,' Derek said.

The 41-year-old had a secret room in his home where the boys were allowed to play video games, miss school and smoke marijuana, their trial heard.

Hope: Derek and Alex King want to move on with their lives and have families of their own

The judge felt that Alex had been vulnerable and manipulated by Chavis, leading to the 12-year-old's second-degree murder charge being replaced with a lesser third-degree charge.

However, both brothers are ready to admit their crime and take responsibility for it.

'I take responsibility for killing him. I will pay for it for the rest of my life,' Derek said.
