For British cameraman Dan Martland, wading into filthy rivers, close shaves with cabs and being crawled on by rats in abandoned buildings is just a regular day at the office. 

The daredevil 36-year-old has gained quite a following on Instagram - using the moniker @dantvusa - by going the extra mile to capture New York like you've never seen before.

The shy freelancer, who worked for ITV News until last year, has been praised for capturing unique shots of some of the city’s most iconic locations.

'A good shot is something which tells the story without words. An angle which people don’t often see. Or can't get to! That's when I end up getting brave and risking my neck in Manhattan ... Don’t tell the wife,' says Dan.

His unusual methods include lying down on a busy 5th Avenue with taxis rushing past, and venturing into the murky depths of the East River to snap the Freedom Tower on the anniversary of 9/11.

Dan claims the secret to his success is patience, and waiting for the perfect moment to present itself

While attempting to shoot the iconic Flatiron Building, Dan tried every trick in the book to gain access to the building opposite, from sweet-talking the doorman, to booking a hair appointment inside.

'I managed to find another secret entrance to the building and saw an opportunity. It was nerve-wracking but felt amazing to finally get the picture I wanted. A real adrenalin rush,' he says. 'And within minutes of putting it on Instagram, the feedback was amazing!'

Dan has had incredible feedback about his images since he began uploading them to the social media site

Ex-colleague Nick Dixon from ITV describes him as nuts: 'Dan is a great example of a daredevil Brit living his American dream - and getting some really impressive results in the process.

'He’s mad! He's going to ridiculous lengths to get the photos and they really are amazing - though he's quite a shy lad and would never think of self-publicising.'

To get the best shot, Dan advises plenty of patience, waiting for the right light and searching for unique angles.

The daredevil photographer captures most of his shots using just his iPhone, allowing him to upload images immediately to Instagram. Other shots are taken using a GoPro, a Sony point and shoot (Rx100 mk3) and a DSLR (Nikon d810).
