The number of police officers in England and Wales fell by almost 3,500 last year to the lowest level in more than a decade.

The 2.6 per cent dip in officer numbers follows a sharp reduction in funding.

Overall, there were 128,351 in the 43 forces of England and Wales on September 30 last year, the lowest figure since September 2002.

Even thinner blue line: The number of police officers in England and Wales fell by almost 3,500 last year. The 2.6 per cent dip in their numbers leave the police force at its lowest strength for more than a decade

There has been an even more marked decline in the number of community support officers, or PCSOs. There are now only 13,552, down six per cent in a year.

Despite cuts, crime has fallen and ministers say the police are more efficient.

The statistics were not due out until today, but were mistakenly published on the Home Office’s website yesterday.

Officials - already under fire over the trustworthiness of police crime figures - were then forced to rush forward their release date.

Chief Constable Mike Cunningham, of the Association of Chief Police officers, said: ‘With reduced recruitment and the considerable cuts made to policing budgets, it is not surprising that the number of officers and staff have reduced, and this clearly presents a challenge for the police service.

‘However, the effectiveness of policing cannot be measured by the number of officers and staff alone.

‘The service has risen to the challenge of dealing with significant financial restraints and continued to maintain the protection of the public.'

Last week, constabularies in England and Wales yesterday reported that the number of crimes fell by 3 per cent last year.

The separate British Crime Survey showed crime falling by 10 per cent year on year to its lowest level since records began in 1981. The survey is traditionally seen as a more reliable barometer of crime levels over time.

It showed sharp falls in violence - by 13 per cent - and snatch thefts. Crimes against households fell 10 per cent and bike theft was down 15 per cent, to its lowest level in a decade.

But there is mounting controversy over whether the crime figures can be trusted.

The UK Statistics Authority has questioned the reliability of the police’s figures and stripped them of their ‘gold standard’ status.

'Police reform is working': Policing Minister Damian Green denied claims that official crime statistics were masking the truth on offences

Experts predict that, when the figures are audited properly, crime will once again begin to rise.

In Kent - where figures have been ‘cleaned up’ after a period of manipulation - recorded crime has risen by 8 per cent.

If the same pattern was repeated across the country nearly 300,000 extra crimes would be reported.

In Kent, violent crime was up a fifth and sex offences and robbery by half. Drug offences were up by 14 per cent, public order offences by 16 per cent and other ‘miscellaneous’ crimes by a third.

It is thought much of the increase is related to the more rigorous recording techniques. Yesterday, David Cameron said recorded crime statistics must be as 'robust as possible'.

But he added that both recorded crime and the BCS had ‘fallen by more than 10 per cent’.

Policing Minister Damian Green said: 'Police reform is working and two independent measures show crime is falling. Getting the economy back on track has meant the police have had to do more with less, but they have shown an impressive ability to make savings while still cutting crime.

'What matters is how officers are deployed, not how many of them there are. HMIC has made clear that there is no simple link between officer numbers and crime levels, the visibility of the police in the community and the quality of service provided.

'Ultimately, decisions on the size and composition of a police force’s workforce are for individual chief officers and Police and Crime Commissioners (PCCs).'

Last night, Labour’s Shadow Policing Minister, Jack Dromey said: ‘The Police Service Strength Figures mistakenly published today will rightly cause concern in communities all over England and Wales.

‘The Government is hollowing out our Police Service. Labour put 17,000 more Police Officers on the beat. Now, that progress has been reversed.’
