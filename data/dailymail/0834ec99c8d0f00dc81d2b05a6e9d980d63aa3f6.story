Outraged chocolate lovers have launched a protest campaign after Cadbury reduced the number of Creme Eggs sold in their boxes while keeping the price roughly the same.

The chocolate giant has cut the number of eggs contained in each pack from six to five.

The move is the latest example of secret price hikes as sweet brands downsize on products while barely reducing the cost to customers.

Good old days: Chocolate giant Cadbury used to sell their Creme Eggs in boxes but recently downsized

Many Creme Egg fans have taken to Facebook and Twitter to complain about the situation.

One disappointed customer said: 'I've been sold a faulty box of eggs. Instead of half a dozen there are only five in the box, the Mirror reports.

'As they still cost the same I'm assuming this is just a dodgy batch.'

And Twitter user, Shani, wrote: 'Creme Eggs in packs of five? That's messing with the basic premise and I take eggception to that.' 

Trade magazine The Grocer said: 'Chocolate fans say it's no yolk that six packs of Cadbury Creme Eggs have been reduced to five packs.'

Downsize: The firm has caused anger with Creme Egg fans by reducing the number found in a box to five

Brand owner Mondelez has got rid of three and six packs of Creme Eggs, which are sold only in the build up to Easter.

The company has replaced them with a five pack to sell alongside singles and 12 packs.

The move came with a slight decrease in the recommended retail price from £3.05 to £2.85.

Some shops charge that, but many others sell the packs for £2 – the same price they charged for a six-pack a year ago.

Mondelez claim the change was a result of 'consumer research', adding that shops are free to set their own prices.

Concern: Many Cadbury customers took to to Twitter to complain about the reduction in Creme Eggs found in each box

Last year Cadbury caused controversy when they announced they would no longer be making their beloved sacks of chocolate coins - just before Christmas.

Explaining their decision, a spokesman told The Telegraph that wrapping foil around the coin-shaped chocolates was 'fiddly' work.

They suggested the coins were not as profitable as other products because they could not market them in the 'Cadbury purple'.

The chocolate maker also believes shoppers have switched to cheaper, own-brand versions sold at supermarkets such as Aldi and Lidl causing its own sales to decline.

'We are sorry to see the coins go, but that's business,' the spokesman added.
