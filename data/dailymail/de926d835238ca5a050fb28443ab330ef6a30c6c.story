She often tops polls as one of showbiz's most glamorous and beautiful faces and is rarely seen without a perfect face of make-up.

And now, Kim Kardashian has shared the contents of her make-up bag with MailOnline.

While she may be able to afford the most luxurious products on the market, she is proud to admit that no item in her personal cosmetics bag sets her back more than £20 ($30).

Beauty secrets: Kim Kardashian has opened her make-up bag and shared her beauty secrets with MailOnline

The new mother explains that one of her beauty essentials is a £12.95 ($15) Moroccanoil.

'This really helps to smooth my hair and makes it so soft,' she said of the oil, which is also loved by Taylor Swift and Beyonce.

When it comes to keeping her cellulite at bay, the 32-year-old swears by Dove Body Scrub.

Speaking about the $8 product, she said: 'I love this; it's great for prepping the skin.'

The reality TV star also uses Bio Oil, £8.95 ($11.99), because it 'prevents wrinkles around my eyes and stretch marks over my body.'

Along with her sisters Khloe and Kourtney, Kim has designed a range of beauty products, Kardashian beauty.

Speaking about her favourites, she said: 'I had to "steal" the first lab sample of Kardashian Beauty Intimate Spotlight because once I’d tried it I never wanted to be without it.

'It adds a 
beautiful glow to cheekbones, bridge of nose and Cupid’s bow to light up
the face. I’m in love with this product!'

She is also a big fan of the Kardashian Beauty Whip Lash Mascara, and the Au Naturel Lip Kit in Nude.

To take it all off at the end of the day, Kim loves Neutrogena Make-up Remover Cleansing Wipes, which she snaps up from Boots for £3.99 ($6.99).

The star, who showed just how much make-up she wears when she famously charted her makeover and shared images of the process with her 16million Twitter followers, said of the remover: 'This is one of my most essential products, I need a makeup wipe at all times.'

Before and after: Kim once tweeted this before and after which showed how much make-up contouring it takes to achieve the finished look

Has Kim’s signature look changed
over the years? Is she keen to push the boundaries, experiment with 
colour and try seasonal beauty trends?

Yes, Kim’s look changes 
daily!  She is so experimental and loves make up more than anyone I 
know. It is a passion of hers. She enjoys getting into character and 
playing with product. While she has a go-to look, she is equally open 
to experimentation with both hair, make-up and clothing and loves to 
coordinate them all- pushing the boundaries. These days she wears less 
artificial lashes   than in the past and sets trends rather than follows
trend.

Did Kim’s pregnancy have an impact on her beauty look?  Other than the obvious differences, she maintained her beauty confidence and routines, and worked well into her pregnancy.

Where do you/Kim get your inspiration from when it comes to her beauty look? Kim
is inspired by fashion and movies. I think we take a lot of cues from 
that. She projects a beauty that is akin to classic movie stars. I often
get inspiration there and try to and make it contemporary.

Are there any beauty looks or products Kim tells you to stay clear of? Kim is open to everything if the timing and execution is right.
