Facebook is apologizing to drag queens and the transgender community for deleting accounts that used drag names like Lil Miss Hot Mess rather than legal names such as Bob Smith.

The world's biggest online social network caught heat recently when it deleted several hundred accounts belonging to self-described drag queens, other performers and members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. 

Facebook has long required its users to go by their 'real names' on the site for security purposes, to stand out from other social networks and so it can better target advertising to people. 

Drag queens (from left) Lil Ms Hot Mess, Sister Roma and Heklina spoke of their disappointment earlier this month after Facebook executives met with them and refused to change the policy banning stage names. Facebook apologized - altough the real names policy isn't changing, the way Facebook enforces it might

Now, the company says the spirit of its policy doesn't mean a person's legal name but 'the authentic name they use in real life.'

Though the real names policy isn't changing, the way Facebook enforces it might.

Last month, the company suggested that performers such as drag queens have other ways of maintaining their stage identities on the site, such as creating pages that are meant for businesses and public figures. 

Identity: The performers told a conference at San Francisco city hall the ban 'wipes them out of existence'

Heklina (left) said: 'I have been Heklina for 20 years, and I have Facebook telling me Heklina does not exist. So they're basically wiping you out of existence'

Anger: Sister Roma and Heklina are two of hundreds whose had profiles have been blocked by the social network 

But a fan page is not the same as a regular Facebook account and users were not happy with the suggestion. 

And a group of transvestites in San Francisco claimed it was their human right to identify as their alter-egos.

Supervisor David Campos, who is representing the drag queens, told a news conference: 'If we're going to work together on this, we want acknowledgement that this policy is misguided.'

He was flanked by the movement's instigator, Sister Roma, and fellow cross dressers Heklina, Bebe Sweetbriar, and Lil Miss Hot Mess.

Heklina said: 'I have been Heklina for 20 years, and I have Facebook telling me Heklina does not exist. So they're basically wiping you out of existence.'

Facebook has long required its users to go by their 'real names' on the site for security purposes, to stand out from other social networks and so it can better target advertising to people

Jinkx Monsoon, star of RuPaul's Drag Race, condemned the policy as a distraction from other more important issues in the community, telling MailOnline: 'Can Facebook just get this figured out quickly please? Aliases have existed for ages, it shouldn't be a surprise to anyone!

'While we squabble over this, we're wasting time we could be spending on more important issues affecting our community.'  

Christopher Cox, Facebook's chief production officer, explained that part of the issue was that a user had flagged the accounts as fake. 

He said in a blog post: 'The stories of mass impersonation, trolling, domestic abuse and higher rates of bullying and intolerance are oftentimes the result of people hiding behind fake names, and it's both terrifying and sad.

'Our ability to successfully protect against them with this policy has borne out the reality that this policy, on balance and when applied carefully, is a very powerful force for good.' 

Cox accepted that many people had endured a 'painful' experience and said they will be able to use their stage names on Facebook.

He continued: 'I want to apologise to the affected community of drag queens, drag kings, transgender, and extensive community of our friends, neighbours, and members of the LGBT community for the hardship that we've put you through in dealing with your Facebook accounts over the past few weeks.

'The spirit of our policy is that everyone on Facebook uses the authentic name they use in real life. For Sister Roma, that's Sister Roma. For Lil Miss Hot Mess, that's Lil Miss Hot Mess.'

He said the issue had shown up the fact that 'there's lots of room for improvement in the reporting and enforcement mechanisms, tools for understanding who's real and who's not'.
