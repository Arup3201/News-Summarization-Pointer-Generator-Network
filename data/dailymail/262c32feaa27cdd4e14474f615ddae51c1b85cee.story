The 13-year-old Florida girl who is accused of plotting with her boyfriend on Facebook to kill her mother will stand trial as an adult.

Yaquelin Galvex Don has been charged with attempted murder after she lured her mother, Luz Galvez into their garage where her 15-year-old boyfriend, Pedro Solis was waiting to slit her throat.

However, Galvez did not die after the March 9 attack and in an incredible twist Solis was convinced to rush her to the hospital where he dumped on the curb and then drove off.

Galvez received emergency surgery that day on the wound to her neck and was able to communicate to police the same day that her daughter and her boyfriend were responsible.

The teens had plotted through Facebook messages to kill the girl's parents for more than a week, investigators said because Don's parent's disapproved of their relationship.

Deputies said that Don tricked her mother into coming to the garage with her where she was met by Solis.

According to the arrest report, Solis confronted Galvez and demanded that they be allowed to stay together at which point he attacked her.

Crime scene: Deputies said the the girl lured her mother, Luz Galvez, into her Ocala garage on Northwest 55th Place, and then Pedro Solis slit her throat on March 9

Galvez's husband is wheelchair bound and was not able to intervene and Solis is also accused of threatening his throat with the knife.

However, he convinced the teen to drive his wife to hospital where she is recovering now.

'Part of what the young man offered in the conversation with the victim is they should be together and to let the 13-year-old and 15-year-old have a romance. But the mom didn't think they should be involved, and quite frankly they retaliated,' said Marion County Sheriff's Office spokesman Judge Cochran.

Don, 13, has been denied bail and The Department of Children and Families is providing care for the 13-year-old's father, Jorge Don-Brianes, who is wheelchair-bound and was also allegedly threatened.

During her first court appearance Saturday, the Ocala Star-Banner reports a judge ordered the girl to be held without bond. The judge said the girl, who wore shackles and a red jumpsuit, faces life in prison if convicted.

Stunning reversal: Authorities said Solis took Galvez to the hospital after she told him he could be with her daughter and that she would not sue him

'When someone is at that age, you have to evaluate the case differently,' said the girl's attorney, Tania Alavi, who expressed disappointment in the decision.

Solis was indicted on March 18 on the same charges and was also denied bond.

His mother, Maria Hernandez, said she urged her 15-year-old son to break off a relationship because she was too young, but he ignored her.

She described Solis as a good boy who loved Don and frequently talked on the phone with her like any normal teenage couple.

Hernandez said her son was suspended from school last fall after getting caught with a small amount of marijuana and was sent to an alternative school.
