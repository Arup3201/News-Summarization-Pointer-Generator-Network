David Cameron today backed Sir John Major's warning that public concern about EU immigration could push Britain out of Europe.

Sir John said this week that the chances of Britain leaving the EU were now 'just under 50 per cent' - and warned the prospect of 'Brexit' would grow unless Brussels agrees to accommodate British concerns about free movement.

Speaking in Germany, Sir John said he wanted Britain to remain in the EU. But he said public concern about the scale of immigration, and its impact on public services, could no longer be ignored.

Support: David Cameron, pictured speaking today in Canberra, said that he agreed with Sir John Major's speech, in which he warned that the UK is likely to leave the EU unless it allows restricted immigration

Asked about his predecessor's comments at a press conference in Canberra, Australia, Mr Cameron said: 'I think it was an excellent speech and I agree with what he said, particularly the point that he went to Germany to make a very clear speech about the need there is to address Britain's concerns about immigration inside the EU.

'I think it is very powerful that a former Prime Minister, a very respected British politician, with a long record of negotiating in Europe, felt it necessary to make that speech in those terms so clearly.

'It seems to me that one of the reasons he feels so strongly about this is that when countries in Europe have difficulties that need to be addressed, Europe needs to have the flexibility to address them.

'When there are problems with the French budget or countries' differing views about what power sources they should use or problems countries have with particular aspects of the EU, we need a network that is flexible enough to cope and manage on these things.

Concerns: Mr Cameron said that the EU needed to have the flexibility to address the issues of its member states. He made the comments at a press conference with Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, above

Welcome: Mr Abbott, pictured today with Mr Cameron ahead of the G20 summit, indicated that he would prefer Britain to stay in the EU but said that he was not going to offer ' specific directives' to other countries

'That's why I think John Major's speech was so powerful, so important and so timely and I agree with what he said.'

Mr Cameron was speaking alongside Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who welcomed him to the Canberra Parliament with a speech in which he hailed the UK as 'a European country with a global role'.

Mr Abbott indicated that he would prefer Britain to stay in the EU.

He said: 'I'm not going to offer any specific directives to other countries, or indeed to the European Union.

'Obviously, it is in all of our interests that Europe collectively is strong, effective and successful. It is in all of our interests - particularly Australia's interests - that Britain is strong, effective and successful.

'I think Britain has very much kept its own character, very much kept its freedom of action, while at the same time being a strong and effective member of Europe. I just don't see that this is an either/or business.

'I think Britain can be a strong, powerful global voice, while at the same time being an effective member of Europe.'
