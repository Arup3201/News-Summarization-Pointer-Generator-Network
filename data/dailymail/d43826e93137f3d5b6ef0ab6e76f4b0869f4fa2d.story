The trial of a teenager who allegedly lured in a victim with a fake Facebook profile before murdering him will reach its closing arguments this week.

Manuel Edmundo Guzman Jr, 19, is accused of setting up a bogus account and using the picture of a 'curvy' and 'seductive' internet model to attract men online.

Prosecutors claim that when Eddie Leal, a 23-year-old professional bantamweight boxer, agreed to meet the fictional woman, known as Rebecca Santhiago, he was shot to death by Guzman in San Jacinto, California. They say Guzman's motive was to kill for a 'thrill.'

Riverside County District Attorney’s Office claim that Guzman, who was 17 at the time, created the profile using a glamor shot of an East Coast internet model, reports ABC.

The account paints a picture of a single 21-year-old, who 'loves to kick it at house parties or clubs' and asks for men to 'show some love and maybe we can hang out.'

Prosecutors described the photo used as showing 'a curvy, attractive, young brunette in a tight dress who was smiling seductively.'

Leal began Facebook messaging 'Santhiago' and a meeting was arranged in a San Jacinto park at around 2 am on May 30, 2011, it is alleged.

The prosecution claims that when Leal arrived he encountered Guzman, who shot him several times, in what attorneys describe as a 'thrill kill.'

Leal died at the scene and authorities found the up and coming boxer in the driver's seat of his Toyota Corolla in Roanoke Street, San Jacinto.

After a year-long investigation, detectives allegedly tracked the bogus Facebook profile to a computer at Guzman’s mother’s house, where he lived.

Investigator Tony Pelato, a computer forensics expert, told The Press Enterprise that he had 'no doubt at all' that Santhiago’s chat messages were typed on Guzman’s computer.

A copy of the Facebook page and the chat messages were reportedly also found on the victim's computer.

Guzman was arrested and charged on April 10, 2012. He was already on probation for a juvenile conviction the previous year.

According to the prosecution, the victim came to meet the fictional woman at this street corner but instead was fatally shot

The defendant's attorneys have argued that the case is circumstantial and there is no evidence the teenager fired a gun.

Last week a witness testified that five bullet casings left at the murder scene did not test positive for any trace of Guzman's DNA.

Guzman faces charges of first-degree murder as well as a special circumstance allegation of lying in wait, as well as gun and great bodily injury allegations.

If convicted, he faces life in prison without the possibility of parole.
