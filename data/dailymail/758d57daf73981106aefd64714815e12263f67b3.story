Bob Crow, the head of the Rail, Maritime and Transport Union is believed to pay half the market rate for his taxpayer-subsidised house despite being paid a substantial salary

Well-off council house tenants are to be targeted in the next round of welfare cuts, as official figures show that up to 100,000 have household incomes in excess of £40,000.

Ministers said it was 'blatantly unfair' that so many people enjoy taxpayer-subsidised housing despite earning more than enough to rent in the private sector or buy their home.

Chancellor George Osborne yesterday identified them as a top target among £12billion of new social security savings that he said were needed after the 2015 general election.

Just weeks ago one well-off tenant, transport union boss Bob Crow, insisted he had 'no moral duty' to move out of his taxpayer-subsidised home – despite his £145,000 pay and expenses package.

Mr Osborne also suggested the under-25s should be stripped of the right to claim housing benefit so that they have to live with their parents – as many starting out in jobs are forced to.

A total of 350,000 people under 25 claim around £1.9billion in housing benefit, though many have children of their own, making cuts controversial.

'I would look at housing benefit for the under-25s when there are many people who can't afford to move out of their home,' Mr Osborne said.

Ministers are drawing up plans to introduce means testing so that those on higher incomes are hit with much higher rents if they insist on staying in council homes.

Official figures suggest that around 86,000 families live in social housing despite having a gross annual household income of between £40,000 and £50,000, while up to 21,000 have incomes of more than £60,000 a year.

Mr Crow, the leader of the RMT union, lives with his family in taxpayer-subsidised social housing in North London.

But he recently claimed he was being victimised and denied there was any ethical obligation for him to use his £145,000 package to buy or rent a property in the private sector.

'I have no moral duty at all,' he said. 'I was born in a council house – as far as I'm concerned I will die in one.'

Housing minister Kris Hopkins said: 'For too long, those on council waiting lists have watched helplessly as very high-earning social tenants continue to live in taxpayer-subsidised homes.

'We want to call time on this  blatant unfairness. If the tenants want to continue using this precious national resource, they will pay for  the privilege.'
