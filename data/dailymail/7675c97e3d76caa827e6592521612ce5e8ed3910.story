Speaking the truth: Leah Remini, pictured today, is set to testify against the Church of Scientology

Actress Leah Remini will testify against the leader of the Church of Scientology in a multi-million dollar harassment lawsuit filed against the religious organisation.

The 43-year-old Dancing With The Stars contestant left the church earlier this summer and has since spoken out against Scientology.

She will give a deposition in a lawsuit filed by the wife of a former executive in the church where it is claimed that members were subjected to investigations and intimidation tactics under the rule of David Miscavige.

Monique Rathbun, married to 
ex-Scientology executive former church Marty Rathburn, filed the lawsuit
in August this year, which includes a restraining order against Mr 
Miscavige.

‘She has been 
subjected to numerous, aggressive attempts to intimidate her.

'She has 
been targeted at home, at work, and anywhere else that she happens to 
be,’ RadarOnline report the lawsuit states.

‘She
has been harassed, insulted, surveilled, photographed, videotaped, 
defamed, and humiliated to such a degree as to shock the conscience of 
any decent, law-abiding person.’

Ms
Remini will leave her deposition on October 15th in Los Angeles, Mrs 
Rathbun’s attorney confirmed to Scientology watchdog website The 
Underground Bunker.

Ms Remini, who starred in hit sitcom King
of Queens for nine years, is believed to have left the organization as 
she is against its policy of barring members from questioning the 
authority of Scientology leader David Miscavige,

The rift is said to have begun at the wedding of Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes in 2006.

Ms Remini
allegedly asked about Miscavige's wife Shelly's absence from the event,
causing former head of the Scientology Celebrity Center Tommy Davis to 
berate her.

According to a blog by ex-Scientology member Mike Rinder, Davis said: 'You don’t have the [bleeping] rank to ask about Shelly.'

Miscavige's
wife has not been seen in public for six years, which led to Ms Remini 
filing a missing person’s lawsuit earlier this summer.

Misgivings: Remini reportedly began to question the Scientology movement when she was berated for asking a question about the whereabouts of the wife of leader David Miscavige (left) at the wedding Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes (right)

LAPD closed the case on the same day after stating Mrs Miscavige had been safely located.

Appearing
on Ellen Degeneres' chat show last month, Ms Remini, who is one of the 
contestants on Dancing With The Stars, spoke more seriously about her 
decision to leave the religion.

'My
mother and I got involved when we were really young so it was all we 
really ever knew,' she said, before explaining that after her 'eyes were
then opened' she could 'no longer be affiliated' with the religion.

Ahead
of one of her performances on DWTS, Remini said, ‘The church is looking
for me to fail so they can say to their parishioners, ‘Look what 
happens when you leave.’ ‘

‘They’re waiting for me to fail.’

In July, Remini released a statement seemingly confirming her break from the institution.

'I
wish to share my sincere and heartfelt appreciation for the 
overwhelming positive response I have received from the media, my 
colleagues, and fans from around the world.

'I am truly 
grateful and thankful for all your support.'

Lives of the rich and famous: The celebrity Scientology center in Los Angeles where meetings include followers Tom Cruise, John Travolta and Juliette Lewis

Leah Remini is one of the most 
recognizable faces of Scientology which boasts a wealth of celebrity 
members including Tom Cruise, John Travolta, Kirstie Alley and Juliette 
Lewis.

In the past, 
Remini, who starred in the movie Old School and had bit parts in Friends
and Cheers, has been an avid defender of the religion. 

In an interview with CNN, she said of Scientology's critics:
'If somebody is going to get turned off about something because of what
they read or heard, then that person's not smart enough to even enter a
church.

'If you're really against something, then know what you're against.'

Remini promoted the launch of a Hollywood museum backed by Scientology, named the  'Citizens
Commission on Human Rights Psychiatry: An Industry of Death'. A key 
component of the Scientology movement is its stand against psychiatry.

Remini,
who was born in Brooklyn, New York, has been involved in the church for
around 30 years after her mother joined in the 1970s.

She
married her King of Queens co-star Angelo Pagán in 2003 and the couple 
have a nine-year-old daughter Sofia Bella. The family lives in Los 
Angeles.
