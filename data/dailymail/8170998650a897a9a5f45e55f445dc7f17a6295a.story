Not many houses can boast of being owned by a former prime minister, hosting Sir Winston Churchill for regular lunches and having had Margaret Thatcher as a close neighbour.

But Holwood House, a sprawling mansion just east of the village of Keston, Kent which is dubbed ‘the original Chequers’, also has the price tag to match its illustrious history.

The 25,000-square foot house has been put up for sale for £12million, further evidence of the booming property market in the South.

The Grade I listed mansion is set in stunning parkland grounds and features views of Canary Wharf and is only a short distance from Biggin Hill where the new owner can park their private jet

The huge sum is a far cry from the house’s celebrated links to the abolition of the slave trade.

Its former owner, William Pitt the Younger, who became the youngest Prime Minister in 1783 at the age of just 24, paid just £8,950 for the house in 1785 despite his ‘consistently unsteady finances.’

The story goes that Mr Pitt and his friend and fellow politician, William Wilberforce, sat together under a large oak tree in the grounds and discussed the abolition of slavery.

The walls on the staircase are adorned with suitably traditional and period appropriate paintings

On 12 May 
1787, Mr Wilberforce wrote in his diary: ‘At length I remember after a 
conversation with Mr Pitt in the open air at the root of an old tree at 
Holwood just above the steep descent into the vale of Keston, we 
resolved to give notice on a first occasion in the House of Commons of 
my intention to bring forward the abolition of the slave trade.’

The tree became known as the ‘Wilberforce oak’ which stood for many centuries before it perished during the Second World War.

It is not the property’s only claim to fame.

Charles Darwin, the famous naturalist, loved the parkland and regularly had picnics with his family there, conducting experiments and observations.

During the Second World War, Sir Winston Churchill also used to ‘dine regularly’ at the Grade 1 listed house.

Today the house strikes a rather different tone.

It is currently owned by City banker, Martin Zapico, 46, who bought it for £2.5million in October 2002.

He has flamboyantly re-decorated the house in a style more commonly associated with a Premier League footballer.

Some of its most opulent features include a gold-themed master bedroom with two dressing rooms and a private lounge.

It has a further five bedrooms – and four extra bedrooms in the ‘staff wing’.

It has not one, but two gyms, as well as an indoor swimming pool, a home cinema, a tennis court, a summer house and a substantial games room with a snooker table.

The estate is a short drive to Biggin Hill airport, which is convenient if the new owner has a private jet they like to use, and is about 14 miles from both Sevenoaks in Kent and Canary Wharf.

Unusually, it has 40 acres of land but still has a view over Canary Wharf, the business district in east London.

Fans of Horrid Henry might recognise the house as it was used in the making of the 2011 film of the popular children’s books by Francesca Simon.

It appears in the dream sequence in the film, starring Angelica Huston, Richard E Grant and Jo Brand, when Henry wants to be a rock star.

James Crawford, a partner in Knight Frank’s prime country team, the estate agency which is selling the property, said it is ‘one of the most important houses in private hands within the M25’.

He said: ‘It is a fabulous family home refurbished to a high standard and offering a range of leisure facilities.

‘To own 40 acres of private parkland within view of Canary Wharf is a rare asset.’

Simon Gooch, the author of ‘Holwood – A stroll around the estate’, said: ‘It is a really handsome building and there are lots of very mature trees around it. Whoever buys it is very lucky.’

Early 17th Century The first version of the house is built and is used variously as a hunting retreat and gathering place for the politicians of the time.

1785 William Pitt the Younger, Prime Minister between 1783-1801 and again in 1804 until his death in 1806, buys the house for £8,950 and uses it as a retreat from the Westminster bubble.

The house has been dubbed ‘the original Chequers’.

1850s Charles Darwin and his wife Emma, who live nearby, are frequent visitors. The grounds have twice been proposed as a UNESCO world heritage site due to this link to the famous naturalist.

1862 The ‘Wilberforce Oak’, where Mr Pitt and William Wilberforce discussed the abolition of slavery, is commemorated by a stone seat put in place by Lord Stanhope, a relation of Mr Pitt.

1871 The widowed Marchioness of Salisbury rents Holwood House and marries Edward Stanley, the 15th Earl of Derby and Foreign Secretary in Disraeli’s administration. They moved from their country retreat in 1873 and snapped up the nearby Keston Lodge a year later. Later, the couple buy Holwood House for £60,000.

1940s Descendants of the family continue to live in the house throughout the war, and regularly host Sir Winston Churchill.

1950s Margaret Thatcher – who is not yet a Tory MP - and her family move into a house on the nearby Keston Park estate.

1953 A company called Seismograph Services makes Holwood House into its headquarters for geo-physical studies.

2002 Bought by its current owner Martin Zapico for £2.5m.

2014 On sale for £12 million.

As well as two gyms and an indoor swimming pool, the house features a summer house and a substantial games room with snooker table

The property is being sold by Knight Frank who have described Holwood House as 'one of the finest Grade I listed Palladian mansions within easy reach of London'

Enthusiastic home cooks will love the marble topped surfaces in the enormous kitchen, although with a staff wing containing four bedrooms, the new owner may not necessarily be preparing their own food

The opulent setting was used during filming of the 2011 movie Horrid Henry starring Angelica Huston, Richard E Grant and Joe Brand
