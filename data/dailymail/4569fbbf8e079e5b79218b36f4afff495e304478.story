It takes guts to appear on a reality show but even more so if that show is about weight and breaking into one of the most size-obsessed industries on the planet - dance.

Hannah Baines, an 18-year-old business manager from Doncaster, is no stranger to hard knocks but refuses to let them stop her from pursuing her dream career in ballet.

On the verge of giving up her dreams because she was deemed too fat to be a dancer, she says her appearance on Channel 4's Bigger Ballet proves once and for all that nothing should stand in the way of bigger girls desperate for a dancing career.

Dancer: Hannah Baines, 18, has long dreamed of becoming a ballerina but her weight proved a problem

What's more, she adds, her role as Odette in the show's production of Swan Lake was a triumph in more ways than one; allowing her to finally beat the bullies who said she had no hope of becoming a dancer.

'I have danced since the age of three and I have always loved it,' she explained in an interview with the Mirror.

'It’s what I do, I live and breathe it, but I have always been bigger, which is my own fault because I like food too much.'

Hannah, who is 5ft 3 and a size 18, added: 'I didn’t have a problem with my size when I was younger but when I got older I started going to dance competitions and people would laugh at me even though I was winning some contests.

'Getting laughed at for your dancing and size when you are so young made me feel horrible. It’s a terrible thing to do to a young girl.'

Ballet has long been notorious for its emphasis on very slender dancers, with the average ballerina weighing somewhere between six and nine stone depending on height and muscle mass.

Its looks-obsessed culture was excoriated in the 2010 film Black Swan which shone a light on the extreme lengths some dancers go to in order to remain slim, as well as the competitive pressure common to the genre.

Those in the industry, however, say that the demand for slender dancers is not about glamourising very thin women; rather, the opposite.

Speaking to industry title Pointe magazine in 2011, Peter Beal, artistic director of Pacific Northwest Ballet, said: 'This is a profession of athletes; it is a profession where we look so closely at the body.

'We enjoy looking at the body—healthy, beautiful bodies. Sometimes both the excess and the underweight are unappealing to look at.

'And I think dancers know that. I think they know when they’re in the zone. When they feel like athletes in peak performance condition. And that is the standard of the profession.'

For Hannah, the jibes about her weight made her even more determined to succeed. 'Weirdly, it didn’t put me down, it made me want to be an even better dancer,' she reveals.

Nevertheless, after being turned down for ballet school because, she believes, of her weight, she had almost given up on her dreams when the chance to be in Big Ballet came along.

Taking the principle role of Odette was, she says, a dream come true and a vindication of the time and effort she has dedicated to dance.

'It showed all the people who laughed at me that I can dance, I can do this.' she says. 'I loved every second of the performance.'

Hannah, who has now applied for a dance course at the University of Manchester, adds: 'I felt really beautiful and it was such a liberating thing to do.

'The best part was right at the end when everyone was clapping and we got a standing ovation. It was just amazing.'
