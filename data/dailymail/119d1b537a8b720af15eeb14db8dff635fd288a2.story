A teenager and her boyfriend who were bogged in a ute for 30 hours during Cyclone Nathan survived by eating her chocolate mud birthday cake.

Shannon Veltman had been in Darwin celebrating her 18th birthday with her boyfriend Aayden Price, 20, and the couple were driving more than 1,000km to their hometown of Nhulunbuy on Sunday – the day the tropical cyclone hit.

Ms Veltman and Mr Price had to be rescued by helicopter after they got stuck while driving on the unsealed Central Arnhem Highway with their two dogs, the ABC reported.

The couple, who were travelling back from Ms Veltman's 18th birthday, had only chocolate mud cake to eat

'We knew there was a cyclone and that. But mum and dad said it was over,' Ms Veltman told ABC.

The 18-year-old said the road was 'sloppy' and was obstructed by fallen trees, forcing the couple to stop and move them with rope.

'We thought the cyclone must have come through here pretty hard… It was pouring down with rain and we were freezing,' she said.

The couple had two near-misses while crossing flooded rivers but more than 20 hours into their drive – on a road that ordinarily takes eight hours to cover – their ute got bogged.

The couple maintained regular contact with rescue services, who were blocked from getting to them due to a river which had broken its banks

Ms Veltman and Mr Price were just 60km away from home, and while they had plenty of water the only food they had was her 18th birthday cake.

'It was a mud cake. Ironic,' she said.

The couple maintained regular contact with rescue services, who were blocked from getting to them due to a river which had broken its banks.

After 30 hours authorities made the decision to send a helicopter to rescue them.

'My dad and Aayden's dad were at the airport waiting for us with chicken and chocolate milk. I smashed down a couple of chickens,' Ms Veltman told ABC.
