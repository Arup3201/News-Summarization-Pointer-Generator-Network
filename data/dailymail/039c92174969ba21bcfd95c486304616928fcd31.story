Luis Felipe Scolari's first venture into international football was cut short when Saddam Hussein decided to invade. Understandably, the then coach of Kuwait thought it prudent to leave town.

But what we are seeing here in Brazil, without such interruptions, is a demonstration of international management at its finest. A style of leadership that is all the more admirable because of the almost intolerable pressure Scolari and his players are under.

By his own admission, Scolari played a part in creating that pressure by declaring some time ago to the Brazilian people – and he has a habit of addressing ‘the Brazilian people’ – that his team were going to win this tournament. But what else could he realistically say? He knew very well it was the minimum expectation from the moment Brazil were awarded this World Cup by FIFA back in 2007.

No, what is impressive about Scolari 
is the way he embraces that pressure head on. The way he deals with it 
in a manner that both protects his players and also appears to have them
 completely under his spell.

You
 only have to see Neymar humbly referring to him as the ‘professor’, or 
Thiago Silva becoming emotional about how ‘Felipao’ supports the players
 ‘at this difficult time’. ‘I have to stop talking about him or I may 
start to cry,’ was the Brazil captain’s closing line at their press 
conference on the eve of Saturday’s extraordinary win against Chile. It 
was not something one could ever imagine Steven Gerrard saying when sat 
alongside Roy Hodgson.

Louis
 van Gaal might disagree but there is no greater orator than Scolari at 
this World Cup. He talks about being ‘three steps from heaven’. He 
candidly admits to feelings of ‘anxiety’ and ‘loneliness’.

And he 
doesn’t discuss Brazil’ s chances simply in terms of ambition and 
potential. He speaks of ‘a promise’ he has made to 200million fanatical 
Brazilians. ‘And if you make a promise you must deliver,’ he says 
courageously.

Father figure: Luiz Felipe Scolari wants to see poster boy Neymar lift the World Cup... not Lionel Messi!

Big Phil 
says it because he knows it is what Brazilians need to hear. It’s like a
 form of counselling; comforting words for a nation terrified by the 
prospect of seeing their team eliminated and so leaving the way clear 
for Argentina, for Lionel Messi rather than Neymar, to lift the trophy.

But
 it serves as a form of counselling for his players as well. He knows 
this Brazil team does not boast the quality he had at his disposal in 
Japan 12 years ago. But if he keeps telling his players they can do it, hell they might just succeed.

He is drawing on all his experience. From the 22 jobs in football management, dating back to 1982, before he took charge of Brazil for a second time.

What went wrong? The Brazil boss was sacked after only seven months at Stamford Bridge

The Chelsea episode might have damaged him in our eyes, because he didn’t look comfortable towards the end of his seven-month tenure at Stamford Bridge. He looked shattered by the whole sorry experience, even if he can take comfort in the quality of other managers the trigger-happy Roman Abramovich has dismissed.

But for the most part he has been successful and never does he seem more in his element than on the international stage. He likes the sense of grand occasion, the huge press conferences. He enjoys making those presidential addresses to a nation. It was something that worked with the Portuguese, when he was guiding them to a European Championship final and a World Cup semi-final after that, and it goes down a storm here.

They admire him for being blessed with unbreakable self-belief. ‘I believe firmly in astrology and since I was a kid the stars told me I was a winner,’ he once said.

And such self-confidence makes him fearless in confrontation too. For instance he thinks nothing of tearing into someone even as precious to the Brazilians as Pele. ‘I think Pele knows nothing about soccer,’ he once remarked. ‘He’s done nothing as a coach and his analysis turns out to be always wrong. If you plan on winning a title, you do the opposite of what Pele says.’

In Scolari they appear to admire this as much as they admire the image of Big Phil the aggressor.

He was managing Portugal when he thumped Serbian defender Ivica Dragutinovic but they adore him for the fact that as well as never pulling any punches, he throws the odd one too.

Indeed, when he said it was time to go back to his ‘aggressive old ways’ on Saturday night, explaining he was too polite when the Chilean bench turned the technical area into a ‘war’, an audience of predominantly Brazilian journalists lapped it up.

There is more to Scolari than grand statements, of course. He stunned his critics during the build-up to the 2002 World Cup by employing a three-man defence. But it meant he could unleash a three-man forward line of Ronaldinho, Ronaldo and Rivaldo and it worked rather well.

This time there are echoes of a midfield change, the introduction of Fernandinho against Chile much like Kleberson’s selection for the quarter-final against England in Shizuoka.

Brazil have their stars and they have their leaders. Before the penalties were taken on Saturday Neymar proved himself to be both, the 22-year-old more vocal than anyone in that Brazilian huddle.

Sum of parts: Luiz Felipe Scolari has managed to create a team, despite not having the greatest players

VIDEO Samba nation continue to dance

But in that huddle there are players inferior to those under Scolari’s command in 2002. Jo, Fred, Julio Cesar. From these players Scolari has still managed to create a team. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts, which surely is the very essence of international management and something a succession of England managers have failed to achieve.

Beyond being a fine tactician, however, Scolari is Brazil’s father figure. A natural leader, it is how he has managed from the beginning and perhaps explains why he struggled at Chelsea. There he found ‘a group of players running things’ and it was not to his liking.

Here he runs the show, as he has done from the moment he walked into that first press conference on the eve of the tournament. ‘I want to say to the people of Brazil, our time has arrived,’ he said. Right now, with a nation gripped by fear and players petrified of failure, with an exciting Columbia team coming next, Scolari is exactly what Brazil needs.
