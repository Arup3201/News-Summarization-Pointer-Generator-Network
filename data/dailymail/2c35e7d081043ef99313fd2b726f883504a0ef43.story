Despite being just 24 years old, N-Dubz singer Tulisa Contostavlos already has a wrinkle busting strategy in place.

But it's not your average anti-ageing plan. Instead of botanicals or vitamin C rich apple extract, the X-Factor judge has chosen a wrinkle-killing remedy based on scary snake venom.

Tulisa has tweeted of her love for Skin Chemist's Wrinkle Killer Snake Serum, a £135 potion that includes syn-ake - a neuro-peptide that mimics the effect of the Asian temple viper's venom.

Youthful: Tulisa Contostavlos, uses Skin Chemists' Wrinkle Killer Snake Serum to keep lines at bay

Effective: Along with the anti-wrinkle snake serum, Tulisa also uses the fat-busting 'Sculpt & Tone' body cream

Also described as 'Botox in a bottle', syn-ake temporarily freezes wrinkles - preventing them from getting any deeper.

In addition to syn-ake, the serum also contains oxygen, which is said to have a smoothing and plumping effect on the skin.

Tulisa, who also uses the brand's fat busting 'Sculpt and Tone' body cream, £135, took to Twitter to sing the praises of the serum, which she described as 'amazing'.

And Tulisa isn't the only A-lister to use snake venom in a bid to stay youthful. Dolce & Gabbana designer, Stefano Gabbana, and TOWIE star Amy Childs are both reported to use the reptilian wrinkle buster.

Skin Chemists is a cosmeceutical brand that produces high quality pharmacist-designed skin and body treatments.

Along with the Wrinkle Killer Snake Serum, Skin Chemists also offers day and night creams, both £145, which also include a dose of syn-ake.

Skin Chemists are offering readers an exclusive 85 per cent discount on Wrinkle Killer Snake Serum, usually £135. To use the discount and get your serum for a bargain £19.99, go to skinchemists.com and enter the code DailyMail1 at the checkout.
