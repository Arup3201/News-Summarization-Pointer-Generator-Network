France and the African Union have announced plans to deploy several thousand more troops into the embattled Central African Republic.

The move comes as thousands of Christians fearing reprisal attacks sought refuge from the Muslim former rebels who now control the country after days of violence left nearly 400 people – and possibly more – dead.

Following a conference on African security in Paris, president Francois Hollande said France was raising its deployment to 1,600 today - 400 more than first announced.

Later, after a meeting of regional 
nations about the Central African Republic, his office said that African
Union nations agreed to increase their total deployment to 6,000 - up 
from around 2,500 now, and nearly double the projected roll-out of 3,600
by year-end.

Amid new 
massacres on Thursday, the UN Security Council adopted a resolution that
allows for a more muscular international effort to quell months of 
unrest in the country.

Troops
from France, the country's former colonial overseer, were patrolling 
roads in Bangui and fanning out into the troubled north west on 
Saturday.

'This force is going to 
deploy as quickly as possible and everywhere there are risks for the 
population, with the African forces that are present - currently 2,500 
soldiers,' Mr Hollande said, referring to the increased French presence.
'In what I believe will be a very short period we will be able to stop 
all exactions and massacres.'

In an interview with France-24 TV, Mr Hollande specified the AU reinforcements would arrive 'in the coming days'.

Word of the bigger deployments came as human rights groups continued the grisly business of counting and collecting bodies of those killed in recent massacres. The death toll in the capital from the recent fighting rose on Saturday to 394, according to Antoine Mbao Bogo, of the local Red Cross.

Meanwhile, Central African Republic's president called on the former rebels who are now integrated into the national army to stay off the streets now being patrolled by French and regional forces.

Presidential spokesman Guy Simplice Kodegue said those who violated the order would be punished.

Central African Republic, one of the world's poorest countries, has been wracked for decades by coups and rebellions.

In March, the Muslim rebel alliance known as Seleka overthrew the Christian president of a decade.

Aid workers returned to the streets today to collect bloated bodies that had been uncollected in the heat since Thursday, when Christian fighters known as the anti-balaka who oppose the country's ruler descended on the capital in a co-ordinated attack on several mostly Muslim neighbourhoods.

Residents of Christian neighbourhoods said the ex-rebels known as Seleka later carried out reprisal attacks, going house-to-house in search of alleged combatants and firing at civilians who merely strayed into the wrong part of town.

Zumbeti Thierry Tresor, 23, was among those killed after he tried to cross through another neighbourhood to visit family members in another part of Bangui. Seleka fighters shot him in the neck and stomach, his friends said.

On Saturday, neighbours hiked the rocky path to his one-room home where his covered body lay on the floor underneath neatly hung music posters.

Outside the front door, his wife wailed hysterically, gripping their three-year-old daughter in her lap as neighbours crowded around her. Alongside their house, a team of a dozen men with sticks and shovels dug Mr Tresor's grave under the shade of a tree.

‘We want the French army to come and protect us,’ said Mr Tresor's friend, Francois Yayi. ‘We have no police to call. The Seleka will kill us all.’

He and his friends begin counting on their fingers the number of neighbours killed amid the latest spasm of bloodshed. At least ten they determine have died since Thursday.
