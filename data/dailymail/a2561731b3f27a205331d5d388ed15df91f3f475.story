The senior Crown lawyer who played a pivotal role in the conviction of two of Stephen Lawrence’s killers was today named the country’s top prosecutor.

Alison Saunders, 52, is to succeed human rights barrister Keir Starmer QC as Director of Public Prosecutions later this year.

The married mother-of-two - currently chief prosecutor in London - has overseen some of the country’s highest profile murder cases during her 27 year career in the Crown Prosecution Service.

But she is best known for making the landmark decision to prosecute Gary Dobson and David Norris over the racist murder of Stephen Lawrence.

The pair, two of the original five murder suspects, were jailed for life last year after a forensic breakthrough in the case.

Prior to their trial, Mrs Saunders had to navigate complex legal issues as Dobson had been previously acquitted of Stephen’s murder, and had to be prosecuted under the new double jeopardy laws.

She becomes the first DPP directly appointed from within the CPS, and only the second woman in history to take up the role.

Police chiefs and senior detectives regard her as a straight-talker who is not afraid to make finely balanced charging decisions.

Married to a leading defence barrister, she is expected to adopt a lower profile than the man she is succeeding as the country’s top prosecutor.

Her appointment follows Mr Starmer’s decision to step down as DPP at the end of October. She will take up her new post on November 1.

It is understood Mrs Saunders beat off competition from senior CPS lawyer Alison Levitt QC to land the job. Ms Levitt is overseeing the prosecutions of dozens of journalists and police officers arrested under Operation Weeting and Operation Elveden.

Attorney General Dominic Grieve said: ‘Alison will make an excellent Director of Public Prosecutions and is the right person to help the Crown Prosecution Service meet the challenges it will face in the coming years.

‘I am particularly pleased that Alison is the first head of the CPS to be appointed from within its ranks as proof of the high quality of the professionals that work within the service.’

Mrs Saunders said: ‘I am delighted and privileged to be appointed as the next Director of Public Prosecutions.

‘To lead an organisation of committed and professional staff is an honour, especially having worked for the CPS since its inception.

‘I look forward to carrying on with the fantastic work that Keir Starmer QC has undertaken, ensuring the CPS further improves and continuing with reforms, both within the CPS and more widely in the criminal justice system.’

Mr Starmer, who has faced criticism over some of his public pronouncements while DPP, said: ‘I have had the privilege of working with Alison Saunders for five years. She has been an outstanding leader within the CPS and she will make a first rate DPP.’
