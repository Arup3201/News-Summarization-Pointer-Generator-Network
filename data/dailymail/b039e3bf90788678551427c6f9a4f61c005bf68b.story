Hamza Ali was jailed for contempt of court and fined £1,500 for failing to attend jury service for three days

A juror was today jailed and fined £1,500 after going on holiday when he should have been sitting on a trial.

Hamza Ali, 20, took three unexplained days off his duty at Snaresbrook Crown Court - arguing there was 'no way' he could miss the trip.

And when he was summoned to explain himself yesterday, Ali arrived 15 minutes late.

Ali, who had to be prompted to apologise to Judge Timothy Lamb QC, said: ‘I was only two minutes late because there was traffic. My dad drove me.

‘I booked my holiday and there was no way of me cancelling it.

‘I went on Friday and I came back on Monday at 6pm.

‘No-one called me to come to court on Tuesday and someone said to come in on the Thursday.’

Judge Lamb sent Ali to the cells for a day before hearing his excuses.

This morning, after another night behind bars, he was fined £1,500 for contempt of court.

The rogue juror had been granted a day off on Friday 30 August.

But on Monday he did not turn up at court.

Unable to get hold of Ali, the Judge was forced to continue the trial while court staff spent three days chasing him. Eventually a summons was issued.

Judge Lamb said his actions had wasted time and money.

He said: ‘You deliberately went on holiday after I warned you of the consequences.

‘The vast majority have no difficulty in understanding the terms of their summons but you think you are an exception.

‘You are not. You are simply arrogant.

‘You cost the taxpayer a great deal of money, you have wasted the time of this court and the time of this court’s staff while they chased you.’

Ali eventually added: 'I sincerely apologise for not attending jury service.

‘I did go on holiday and I did not realise how important it was.’
