The White House was aware of James Foley's location before his death claims the murdered journalist's former boss, who says he hired an international security firm to locate the kidnapped reporter.

GlobalPost CEO, Philip Balboni, said today that his organization knew of Foley's whereabouts in Syria and said it was safe to assume the US government knew of it too.

The media executive also said Secretary of State John Kerry had been personally involved at some level of the search or negotiations for Foley's return, but refused to go into details.

In a press conference, Balboni revealed he had personally spent 'millions' trying to retrieve Foley, 40, but the journalist was ultimately shown 'no mercy' by his captors who beheaded him and posted the grisly video online on Tuesday.

Speaking from Boston, Balboni also revealed that Foley's family had been emailed by ISIS last Wednesday and informed that the terror group intended to execute the reporter in retaliation for US bombing in support of Kurdish fighters in northern Iraq.

Balboni said that ISIS 'made no demands' in their email and 'it was just a statement that they were going to execute Jim'.

Balboni said he passed on the email to the government immediately and at the press conference said, 'It's safe to say our government knew.'

'We received an email from the captors on Wednesday night of last week stating their intention to execute Jim,' said Balboni in an interview with WCVB-TV in Boston.

The ominous email differed to prior correspondences from ISIS, which usually contained either financial or political demands.

Balboni said that what terrified him and the Foley family was the tone of the message, which was 'vitriolic' and full or rage in the aftermath of US bombing against Islamic State targets in Iraq.

Balboni said they tried to engage in a conversation with the terrorists and initially held out hope.

'But you can see the seething anger. It could have been a bluff and we had to believe it was a bluff,' said Balboni to WCVB.

'You know when you kidnap someone and hold them for almost two years, you don't do it unless you believe there is value in those hostages.'

'The question of whether it is right to pay a ransom is a complicated one,' Balboni, told MailOnline. 'We know that European governments with the exception of Britain, have paid them and we see that they have succeeded.

'You could say that speaks volumes, but, of course there are certain countervailing issues on the other side.'

Despite Foley's murder, Balboni says he still has hope for other hostages held by the Islamic terrorist group, including journalist Steven Sotloff who was paraded before the camera by Foley's executioner, who said he would be next if American bombings did not halt.

'I feel that IS have made their cool and awful point and that they see residual value in the remaining hostages, both American and British, and they will come to some form of negotiation,' Balboni told MailOnline.

'The ball game has changed since the American bombing started and since IS has flexed its muscles and rampaged through Iraq. They may now want to be dealt with in a different way,' he said, suggesting the group could now be open to diplomacy and negotiaion.

'They consider themselves to be a state and that implies - in their minds - a sense of legitimacy.'

Balboni said that immediately upon Foley's abduction at gunpoint in Syria on Thanksgiving in 2012 he hired a international team of contractors to find him.

The CEO said that in September of 2013 that firm, which he did not name, found Foley and has been tracking him ever since.

According to the Boston Globe the firm had been able to follow Foley, even though he being was transported to different sites.

A plaintive Balboni said that his firm had spent millions of dollars to get their man back and according to the Boston Globe was 'fairly sure' the White House knew where Foley was.

He also divulged during the press conference that he believed the federal government had attempted to rescue Foley over the past 22 months - but said that these missions were obviously classified - and presumably failed.

Foley was held captive with other hostages, who were European journalists and Balboni told the Boston Globe that they were released when their ransoms were paid.

However, because Foley was an American, 'There were monetary challenges that were not going to be easy to overcome.'

'Jim Foley was an incredibly brave journalist and an incredibly brave man right to the horrible end of his life,' Balboni said to the Boston Globe.

The execution of journalist James Foley drew international condemnation, and western nations responded with stepped-up efforts to counter the threat posed by Islamic State.

Germany announced it would supply the Kurds with weapons to fight the insurgent. Italy's defense minister said the country hopes to contribute machine guns, ammunition and anti-tank rockets.

French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said the killing showed the true face of this 'caliphate of barbarism.'

In capitals across the Middle East, by contrast, the news of Foley's death was met with silence, even in Syria and Iraq - the two countries where the Islamic State is strongest.

On social media, people in the region condemned Foley's killing, but stressed that the Islamic State has been committing atrocities against Iraqis and Syrians for years.

In Foley's home town of Rochester, New Hampshire, his parents spoke to reporters in an appearance where wrenching grief over their son's death mingled with laughter over his life.

Diane Foley said her son was courageous to the end and called his death 'just evil.'

'We are just very proud of Jimmy and we are praying for the strength to love like he did and keep courageous and keep fighting for all the people he was fighting for,' she said.

'We pray for all the remaining Americans.'
