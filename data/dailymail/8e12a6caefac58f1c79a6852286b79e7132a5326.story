A woman and her boyfriend moved in with her uncle, stole from his bank accounts and then suffocated him before jumping to their deaths off the George Washington Bridge, police said Wednesday.

Suffern Police Chief Clarke Osborn said investigators are confident they have pieced together the strange story but acknowledged that with all three principals dead, 'We may never be able to answer some of the questions.'

The killing of William Valenti, 70, of Suffern, was discovered Monday by a nephew, Osborn said. The killers, identified as Nickie Hunt, 40, and Gary Crockett, 41, had tried to delay the discovery of the body by posting a note on the back door that said Valenti had been taken to a hospital, the chief said. But Valenti was in his bedroom, dead from asphyxiation.

Gary Crockett, 41, and Nickie Circelli, 40, both of Suffern, N.Y.,  died after jumping into the Hudson River about 11:20 a.m. Monday

Osborn said police have not established how he was suffocated or which person did it.

Detective Craig Long said Hunt also left a few notes, including one addressed to 'the four most amazing kids this world has ever seen or ever will.'

He said that note did not mention the killing or admit guilt but apologized in general for the children's upbringing and Hunt's estrangement from their father.

The children did not live with Hunt.

'The tenor of the note indicates that she is going down a dark road' but does not specifically mention suicide, Long said. Crockett left no note, he said.

As detectives investigated the killing, they learned about a 'family dispute' — Valenti had accused the couple of stealing more than $1,000 from him and had threatened to go to the police, Osborn said.

Note: Officials say Hunt left a suicide note for her children - however, it did not acknowledge the murder of Valenti

Several hours after the killing, a police dispatcher heard about the George Washington Bridge double suicide and mentioned it to detectives. The jumpers carried no identification, but their description — a white man and woman in their 40s — fit the suspects. The key to Valenti's Chevrolet Malibu was in the dead woman's pocket, Osborn said, and the two have since been positively identified.

Osborn said investigators believe Hunt and Crockett fled the murder scene in the Malibu, drove the 20 miles to one side of the bridge, walked out onto the span and jumped. He said the car has not been found.

Osborn said the killing was the first in Suffern in more than a decade.

He said Valenti had no relatives closer than his niece and nephew.

Drugs: Hunt and Crockett were known drug users, and authorities say they stole about $1,300 from Valenti prior to murdering him

When Valenti's body was found, an autopsy revealed that had a broken vertebra in his neck, which authorities believe was caused by Hunt or Crockett - or both.

Their death has been linked to that of Nickie Circelli's (pictured) uncle in Suffern on Monday

A neighbor told the New York Daily News that she heard a loud 'boom' from Circelli’s relative’s flat on Monday night.

Josefina Rodriguez, 42, lives in an apartment above Circelli’s uncle said:  'In the morning I didn’t hear him cough,' she added, referring to the victim.

'He always coughed. And every day I heard his truck. When I didn’t hear his truck, I thought something must be wrong.'

She said Circelli’s uncle was found dead on Monday afternoon by his business partner - they owned a catering business.

Investigators found a letter in which the couple apologized for their actions, a source told the New York Daily News.

The couple did not have identification on them when they were pulled from the water so the letter was a crucial piece of evidence that enabled investigators to identify them.

A woman who said she had been a friend of the couple, Heather Becraft of Sloatsburg, N.Y.,  said Circelli had children who live in another part of New York State with their father.

She said they 'were very much in love' but had been having problems that she did not disclose, reported North Jersey.com.

Another friend, who asked not to be identified, told the website that the couple struggled with drug addiction.

The deputy mayor of Suffern, Jo Meegan-Corrigan, said on Tuesday night that a man’s body was found at the home where the couple lived on Washington Avenue.

She declined to provide more details, saying she 'would like to give the family time to gather themselves.'

Port Authority spokesman Joseph Pentangelo said workers on the lower level of the bridge saw an object go by them at about 11:20 a.m. When they looked down, they saw the man and the woman in the water

The pair, who both had a criminal record, were seen walking on the bridge together, from the Hudson River near 125th St. at about 12:10 p.m., officials said.

Port 
Authority spokesman Joseph Pentangelo said workers on the lower level of
 the bridge saw an object go by them at about 11:20 a.m. When they 
looked down, they saw the man and the woman in the water.

Workers had seen the pair along the walkway moments earlier before hearing a splash.

They were in critical condition after 
NYPD units pulled them from the Hudson River and took them to  Mount Sinai St. Luke’s hospital in Manhattan where they died.
