Flash floods caused chaos  yesterday as a fortnight’s rain fell in just half an hour in some areas.

Surges of waist-high water in Dorset forced shopkeepers to flee submerged stores and motorists to abandon their vehicles as towns were brought to a standstill for several hours.

Huge cracks opened along main roads in Bournemouth and lifeguards had to run for cover as a torrent of water rushed through the town to the beach, which would normally be packed with tourists.Residents reported 3ft tides of water heading towards their homes.

TOMORROW: Scotland will see some sunshine with a few early showers in the east. It will then cloud over from the west with somedrizzle or light rain by the evening.

Elsewhere it will be, a fine and dry day with some lengthy spells of sunshine around. Feeling warmer.

SATURDAY: Central and southern England should be mostly dry with some warm sunshine. However, there could be the odd heavy shower, especially during the evening. Elsewhere, plenty of cloud with the chance of rain.

SUNDAY: There will be unsettled showers or longer spells of rain, some heavy and thundery, especially across south-east England. Potentially very warm and humid oversouth-eastern areas.

Torrential deluges in Hampshire also 
caused havoc in Southampton, Basingstoke and Winchester, with roads 
closed across the county.

A Dorset Fire and Rescue Service spokesman said: ‘One car in Wimborne 
was seen to float away with an elderly couple inside and members of the 
public helped push it back on to land.’

He said firemen responded to more than 100 incidents in the two hours 
from 10.30am, adding: ‘There were people stranded in vehicles and 
buildings with water gushing in.

‘Many people were stranded on the roads where police vehicles couldn’t reach them, so we sent wading teams in.’

Meteorologist Dr Richard Wild, from independent weather forcasters 
Weathernet, said 30mm of rain fell in 30 minutes, adding: ‘The average 
rainfall for August is 56mm, so that’s around half.

‘Anything over 4mm an hour is considered heavy so this was well beyond that.

‘The rain was forecast, caused by a warm front over the Channel, but the amount was underestimated.’

Although regions across the country were affected, including Dunbar in 
East Lothian and Maidenhead and Reading in Berkshire, it was Dorset that
 bore the brunt.

The heavy downpour which hit southern England today came so quickly it was likened to a monsoon.

The sudden downpours are common to countries with tropical weather in parts of south-east Asia - but not Britain.

Monsoons are caused by sudden changes in air pressure and different temperatures at land and sea.

In Bournemouth:

Hoytek Lodej, 42, who lives in the town, said: ‘The water was running 
down the road outside my house. It must have only taken a few minutes 
and it rose really quickly, about three-feet high.

‘It came through the front and back doors, into the hallway, living room and ground floor bedroom.

‘After half an hour the back garden was like a swimming pool.’

Technical consultant Kris Wingfield-Bennett, 26, said: ‘There was a 
Dunkirk spirit and some motorists stopped to pick up stranded people and
 take them to dry land.

‘It was like a disaster movie.’

Last night, forecasters warned of further flooding, although it should be sunny today and tomorrow.

Helen Chivers, of the Met Office, said: ‘Some places have had a month’s worth of rain in hours.

‘The biggest downpour was on the Isle of Portland in Dorset, which saw 57.8mm. Up to 17mm was falling per hour.

‘We expect thundery rain on Sunday and Monday across the whole of south 
and south-east England and East Anglia. It has the potential to cause 
disruption and flooding – up to 50mm in three hours.'

Dr Richard Wild, from independent weather forecasters Weathernet said that the South had been hit by a huge downpour - but it will be sunny again by the weekend.

'We've had 30mm of rain this morning. The average rainfall for August in 56mm, so it is around half that in just one morning,' he said.

'Anything over 4mm of rain in an hour is considered 'heavy' so this was well beyond that level.

'The rain was forecast, caused by a warm front over the English Channel which is heading north-eastwards, but the amount was underestimated.

'The forecast for Friday and Saturday is sunny and dry but that might be of little consolation to people hit by flooding today.'
