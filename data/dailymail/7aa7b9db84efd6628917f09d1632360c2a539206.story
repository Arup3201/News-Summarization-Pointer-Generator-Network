A 53-year-old paedophile opened a milk bar near a high school before he assaulted another victim, despite having previously been jailed for two years for sexual offences against a teenage boy.

Brett Barrett, who was locked up in a Queensland jail in the late 1990s, started a new life in Victoria where he took over the store in Melbourne’s south east that advertised 'after-school specials' in late 2013,The Age revealed.

The convicted child sex offender was sentenced to seven months jail on Thursday after he groped a boy, showed him pornography, and sent him a picture of his genitals. 

Convicted child sex offender Brett Barrett ran a milk bar in Melbourne’s south east near a high school 

Barrett's lawyer said he would appeal the sentence handed down for three counts of committing an indecent act against a teenager.

The Age reports that detectives investigating Barrett’s latest sex crime did not know he was running a milk bar.

This is thought to be because his last conviction was before the National Child Offender Register was introduced to Victoria in 2004, meaning Barrett did not receive police monitoring while living in the state.

The Register tracks those convicted of sex offences against children after 2003. An individual can be placed on the register for a period of eight or fifteen years, or for life, depending on the type and severity of the offences.

All states now use a website that monitors and shares mandatory information about convicted paedophiles with police across states and enables alerts to be generated when registered persons say that they are planning to travel interstate or overseas.

However, there have been calls for a public national sex offender register, a proposal recently rejected by all states and territories apart from the Northern Territory at a Council of Australian Governments meeting.

The Northern Territory became the first jurisdiction in Australia to introduce a website where the public can look up what convicted sex offenders are in their area, including an image and physical description.

The NT’s register will be named after murdered Queensland teenager Daniel Morcombe, whose parents Bruce and Denise have campaigned for over a decade for a public register. 

'Every parent has the right to know if there is a dangerous sex offender living in their neighbourhood,' they said in a statement. 

Tireless ‘name and shame’ campaigner Derryn Hinch has also fought to have a national public register introduced and told Daily Mail Australia that this milk bar story is not an example of someone slipping through the system because a ‘system doesn’t exist’.

If there was a national public register the public could have seen this sleazy guy running “after-school specials” for kids and they could have checked the register and looked him up,’ Mr Hinch said. 

Mr Hinch, who has served time in jail and five weeks under house arrest as a consequence of his belief that the public have ‘a right to know’ who sex offenders are, also slammed the sentence handed down to Barrett. 

‘What also angers me is he’s got a seven month jail sentence despite previous convictions and the lawyer says he’s going to appeal. I hope he does appeal and it gets changed to seven years.’ 

The veteran journalist said Australia is home to over 100,000 predators and if it’s just the NT that uses a public register they will cross state borders to avoid detection. 

‘The Northern Territory is going to bring this in and this story is a prime example of the reason we need it to be national because it’s a domino effect and people crossing state borders… this gives me even more belief that in three years we will have a national register,’ he explained.
