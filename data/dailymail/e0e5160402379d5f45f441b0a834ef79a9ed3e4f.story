Terri Sproul: The 19-year-old, seen outside Coventry Magistrates Court, wasted police time with her rape lies

A teenager who falsely claimed she had been violently raped was caught after she tried to cover up her lies on her Facebook page, a court heard.

Terri Sproul’s claim that she had been assaulted as she walked home from a party led police to spend 147 hours trawling CCTV footage while forensic teams carried out a finger-tip search of Coventry city centre.

But her lies unravelled when officers found a message on her Facebook page to a man she had consensual sex with on the night of the alleged rape.

The 19-year-old posted the comment: ‘Oi Oi sexy how are you? Listen if the police phone you I got out of the taxi on my own. Don't say you came to mine.’

She pretended she had been attacked by an unknown other man.

But jobless Sproul walked free from court after she admitted wasting police time by making up the false rape claim at Coventry Magistrates Court yesterday.

She was given a 16-week prison sentence suspended for 12 months and ordered to carry out 200 hours unpaid work.

Katie Simpson, prosecuting, told the court: ‘When they [the police] spoke to her about the Facebook messages she became very emotional.

‘She started crying and admitted to the police that she had lied to them.

‘She said she had never been raped and when they asked her why she had lied she said simply because she wanted to seek help.’

Giveaway: Sproul's Facebook page, on which she told a man she had sex with before she claimed she was raped by a random attacker: 'Oi Oi sexy how are you? Listen if the police phone you I got out of the taxi on my own. Don't say you came to mine'

The court heard Sproul had been at an alcohol and drug-fuelled party at a friend's house in Coventry.

Witnesses saw her snorting cocaine before she met a man who she later had sex with.

Officers interviewed the man who admitted having consensual sex with her.

But she pretended to police she had been attacked by another man in the city centre as she walked home from the party.

Sproul, from Coventry, maintained her lie for six weeks before she finally admitted making the entire attack up.

Stefan
Hunka, defending, told the court Sproul was suffering at the time after
falling out with her parents because of her £300-a-day drug habit.

He said: ‘It's extremely fortunate for her that we don't have a human victim in this case.

‘No-one was arrested and no-one was held in custody.

‘Even though I represent her I was to get across the enormity of what might have happened here.’

Magistrate Steve Old told Sproul she had ‘narrowly avoided' a prison sentence.
