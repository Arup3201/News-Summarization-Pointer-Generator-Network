An extremist  preacher who defended the Charlie Hebdo massacre just hours after the attacks were carried out has branded taxpayer-funded deradicalisation schemes a 'scam'.

Mizanur Rahman, 32, was sent on a programme aimed at turning him away from extreme views after he was released from prison three years into a six-year sentence for soliciting murder. 

The cleric was jailed in 2007 after calling for soldiers to be brought back from Iraq in body bags but claims he then spent most his time in the Government's deradicalisation programme playing pool.

He told BBC Radio 5 Live: 'Basically I would go there and play pool. There were a couple of people there who were in prison with me. We used to catch up and play pool, then go home.

'Sometimes I wouldn't even do that. I would just show my face then go home. I think I probably had a conversation once or twice in the whole period.

'It's just a scam - the whole thing is a money-making scheme. They are making a lot of money from the Government and actually doing nothing with it.'

The outspoken preacher has been responsible for a string of extremist and inflammatory statements.

During his trial at the Old Bailey, a film was shown in which he told a crowd of 300 protesters: 'We want to see them coming home in body bags. We want to see their blood running in the streets of Baghdad.'

He added: 'We want to see the Mujahideen shoot down their planes the way we shoot down birds, we want to see their tanks burn in the way we burn their flags.'

Rahman also had placards calling for the annihilation and beheading of those who insulted Islam.

Just recently he backed the Paris massacres hours after the bloody events unfolded and told his followers 'Britain is the enemy of Islam'.

He defended the brutal murder of 12 people at the Charlie Hebdo offices, saying: 'Insulting Islam... they can’t expect a different result.'

Set up in 2005 in the wake of the London bombings, the Government's Prevent strategy attempts to 'deradicalise' or soften extremist views.

However, it has been widely condemned as failing, and with an approximate budget of £40million per year, an extremely expensive one.

Under the programme, the Government works with mosques and religious groups to reinforce anti-jihad messages, while social workers, psychologists and medical experts counsel radicals.

However, the programme has been widely condemned. Among the issues plaguing the initiative is the impossibility to assess its effectiveness as well as its potential to create an 'us and them' mindset in the communities it targets, and stigmatise Muslims.

Experts warned the sermon, which backed the jihadists who killed 17 people over three days in the French capital, could incite further killings.

The Government's Prevent strategy, which aims to tackle radicalisation, has come under the spotlight after hundreds of Britons travelled to Syria to fight alongside Islamic State. 

The Home Office said the initiative was 'fundamentally revised' in 2011.

A spokeswoman said: 'As a country, we must consistently challenge the twisted narrative of extremism that has seduced some of our vulnerable young people.

'We have trained more than 130,000 people working on the front line of our public sector to help identify and prevent extremism, excluded more preachers of hate than any other government and successfully taken down more than 75,000 pieces of terrorist-related material from the internet.'

The Home Office also highlighted measures in new anti-terror legislation.

'The new Counter-terrorism and Security Act will make Channel, the voluntary programme for people at risk of radicalisation, a legal requirement for public bodies ensuring it is delivered consistently across the country,' the spokeswoman said.

'The Act also creates a new duty to prevent people from being drawn into terrorism. Specified authorities such as police, prisons, local authorities, schools and universities will be required to have due regard to the Prevent duty.'
