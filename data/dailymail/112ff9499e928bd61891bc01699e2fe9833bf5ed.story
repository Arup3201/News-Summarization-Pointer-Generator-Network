Simon Land (pictured) admitted causing unnecessary suffering to an animal

A man battered his pet cat with an iron bar after it jumped on him and sunk its claws into his back in a 'wildlife programme'-style attack, a court has been told.

Simon Land beat the cat with a 3ft-long bar after the animal mauled him as he tried to move it from his bedroom.

The three-year-old animal's injuries were so severe that vets had to put her down.

After the attack, Land, 43, called 999 in a desperate bid to save the ginger-and-white cat Mia.

Despite RSPCA inspectors racing the animal to a vet in a shopping trolley to get her emergency treatment, she had to be put to sleep, a court was told.

Land was arrested and, during an appearance at Macclesfield Magistrates' Court yesterday, he admitted causing unnecessary suffering to an animal.

He was banned from keeping animals for five years and ordered to pay £250 in court costs.

Land suffered scratches as a result of being attacked by Mia, magistrates said.

Charles Overton, chairman of the bench, told Land: 'The aggravating factor is the cat died as a result of a weapon.'

Land, who had bought the cat from a woman on the internet, revealed how the cat had attacked him at his home in Congleton, Cheshire, on the night of January 24.

He told the court he knew Mia was a 'problem cat' but was determined to look after her.

He claimed he found Mia behind his wardrobe and tried to remove her from his bedroom because it was a cold night and he wanted to close the door.

Andrew Meachin, prosecuting, said: 'He said he went to get her out and she went into a frenzy.

'She was jumping all over him and he couldn’t get her off him.

'He said he had only seen something like that in wildlife programmes.'

After beating the cat off, Land took a shower before dialling 999 and begging the police for help.

Mr Meachin added: 'Land stated that he had just got out of the shower as he had been covered in blood and he had called the police as he didn’t know what to do.

'No reasonable person would pick up a metal bar and hit a cat - there is no justification'

'When asked what had happened he stated that his cat, Mia, had attacked him and, to get her off, he hit her with an iron bar.

'When asked where Mia was, he pointed to underneath the settee.

'The officers saw a small, white and ginger cat cowering underneath and it was clear the cat had a severe injury to its right eye, which was very swollen and blood-red.'

Despite desperate attempts to save the cat, a vet put her to sleep after ruling her injuries were too severe.

Julian Farley, defending, told the court Land acted in self defence.

He said: 'It was an extremely difficult cat. I’m not saying he should have done what he did, but it was a very difficult cat to handle.

'He expressed his remorse but nevertheless, we are where we are.'

After the case, RSPCA inspector Lisa Lupson said: 'No reasonable person would pick up a metal bar and hit a cat - there is no justification.'

Land refused to comment outside court.
