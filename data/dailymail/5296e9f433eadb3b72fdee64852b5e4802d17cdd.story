Gwyneth Paltrow has expanded her Goop offering to include bras, yours for only $80 - but only if you have a rather small back girth.

The 42-year-old actress' lifestyle website has launched two bras, both designed by New York-based start-up Negative Underwear, and they're only available in band sizes 32 and 34 - which tends to correspond with a U.S. 0-4 in dress size.

The largest size available in terms of cup-size is a  32DD, and according to Goop's description, the bras - which are not returnable - 'can run slightly small.'

Vital statistics: Ms Paltrow, pictured earlier this year, is estimated to be between a 32-34B bra-size herself

In a new blog post titled 'The Perfect Bra', Goop readers are treated to a selection of 'beautiful lingerie that’s not so fancy you can’t wear it everyday, but prettier than granny panties.'

The bras, priced between $37 and $240, are available to buy from a range of sources including Net-a-Porter and Journelle, but the only ones available to buy directly from Goop are the aforementioned Negative Underwear numbers.

Struggling brand: Goop - which has been operating at a loss since its 2008 launch - is much derided for its extravagant style advice and product listings

The years have been kind to her! Ms Paltrow, pictured (left) in 2002 wearing an Alexander McQueen dress she later said she 'should have worn a bra with' and (right) last year in Los Angeles

'We know that a bralette just isn’t a reality for those of us who are bustier,' the blog post astutely states, directing readers to their 'understated underwires.'

The 'white essaouria demi' and the 'exclusive white albratross demi' are available in cup-sizes A through DD, and it's not that Goop has sold out of band sizes upwards of 34.

Negative Underwear simply doesn't manufacture its bras any larger.

'We believe that less is more,' its own website reads. 'In a world of pushed up and overdone, we’re intentionally not.'

What 32DD looks like: Katy Perry has declared herself a proud 32DD bra-size, so would just about fit into Goop's largest option

To be fair, the average American bra size is 34DD, according to a major study conducted by Intimacy last year. Still a little too large for Goop's new offering.

But average has never really been Ms Paltrow's thing.

Goop - which has been operating at a loss since its 2008 launch - is much derided for its extravagant style advice and product listings.

Items on Ms Paltrow's Goop Christmas gift guide this year, for example, include a $4,800 gold-plated juicer and ‘bargains’ such as a $7,500 Cartier bracelet and baggage by Valentino for $4,500.
