A son whose 92-year-old mother suffered a fatal fall at a nursing home was this week awarded an astonishing $200million in compensation.

Richard Nunziata, 58, of St Petersburg, Florida, represented her estate and sued the company which operated the home in Pinellas Park, Florida.

Elvira Nunziata died in October 2004 after slipping away from residents at the home and falling down a flight of stairs in her wheelchair.

‘I think this is the largest nursing home verdict in the state,’ Mr Nunziata’s lawyer Bennie Lazzara told the Tampa Bay Times.

‘This was a very difficult experience for (Mr Nunziata). He's satisfied that he's going to get some justice out of this.’

Ms Nunziata allegedly went missing for an hour before anybody at the home realised - but she was later found at the bottom of 10 stairs.

She had fallen down the stairs while still strapped in her wheelchair and died soon after paramedics arrived, reported the Tampa Bay Times.

Ms Nunziata had been living at the home for 14 months and was known to wander, nursing staff told a Pinnelas Park court during a trial this week.

The home was understaffed at the time 
and she had previously suffered falls, injuries and illnesses before the
tragic incident, the court heard.

But Ms Nunziata, who had the onset of 
dementia, was not tracked despite alarms on her clothing, wheelchair and
an emergency door through which she fell down the stairs.

Pinellas Park Care and Rehabilitation 
Center was operated by Trans Health Management, whom the mammoth lawsuit
was filed against.

Mr Nunziata was awarded a whopping $60million in compensation and $140million in punitive damages, reported the Tampa Bay Times.

Neither Mr Nunziata or Trans Health Management have commented. The care home is now operated by a different company.
