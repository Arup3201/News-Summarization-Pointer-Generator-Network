Jozy Altidore says Sunderland have to get nasty if they’re to avoid a repeat of last season’s struggle.

The Black Cats have yet to win in the Premier League this season and were knocked out of the League Cup by Stoke on Tuesday.

Gus Poyet’s team are only outside the relegation zone – where they resided for much of the last campaign – by virtue of goal difference and take on fifth-placed Swansea at the Stadium of Light on Saturday.

Jozy Altidore scored for Sunderland on Tuesday and says the Black Cats need to get nastier as a team

Altidore's goal was his first in 30 matches, and only his third since joining the club last summer

Altidore broke a 30-match goal drought against Stoke and the USA striker could now keep his place for the visit of the Swans.

And the £6.5million frontman – criticised having scored just twice in over a year – believes Sunderland have been too soft in front of goal.

‘We need to be tougher,’ he said. ‘It is too easy sometimes. All of us, strikers, everyone, have to be nastier and make sure when people play us they have to really work for it.

The American striker is determined to help Sunderland avoid another relegation scrap like last season

‘There is room for improvement. We have to play better and we have to get the first win.

‘We don't want the shadows of last season following us around this season. We have had a decent start and now with the home schedule we have we have to take three points.

‘Swansea are a team you look at. They have built something, they stay consistent and their identity shows. We have to all come together at Sunderland and make that happen.’

Meanwhile, former England winger Adam Johnson could find himself out of the side this weekend after an indifferent start to the season. 

Manager Gus Poyet has been left frustrated by his side's winless start to the Premier League campaign

Adam Johnson has started the season poorly and could be dropped on Saturday for the visit of Swansea

Winger Will Buckley, signed for £2.5million from Brighton this summer, could replace Johnson for the match

Poyet has promised £2.5m wideman Will Buckley a start against Swansea and Johnson, who lost possession in the build up to Stoke’s winner during the week, is under threat.

And Buckley said: ‘It (Poyet’s promise) was good to hear personally.

‘Obviously I've come here and I want to play. I've been bought to produce.

Swansea have made a very impressive start to the season, with Gylfi Sigurdsson in excellent form

The Swans are fifth in the Premier League and beat Everton 3-0 on Tuesday in the Capital One cup

‘Hopefully I can get minutes in the Premier League to show that. All the players who haven't been playing are eager to play.

‘But we definitely need to win at least one of these two (at home to Swansea and then Stoke).

‘It’s not been a bad start to the season but we have to get off the mark as quickly as possible.

‘And getting that first league win will give everyone a big confidence boost.’
