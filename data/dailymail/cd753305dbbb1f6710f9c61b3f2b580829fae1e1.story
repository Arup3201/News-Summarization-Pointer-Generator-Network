If he plans to run for president, Jeb Bush is going to have to get a little more creative with his campaign website's name.

That's because a gay couple from Portland bought the domain JebBushforPresident.com in 2008, and they have no plans to sell it to the current front-runner for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.

CJ Phillips and Charlie Rainwater, who describe themselves as a 'high tech bears' and a 'couple of nerds', will use the site as a platform to educate their friends and families about lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) issues, they told Business Insider.

Mr Phillips said the couple originally planned to blog about their opinions on various national and international legislation affecting people in the LGBT community, and decided to hold on to the site as their rights continued to be challenged. 

'We didn't see LGBT equality getting any better, and we felt said rights would more than likely still be in the spotlight in the run-up for the next several election cycles,' he said. 

'Jeb's name was already being bandied about in the news as a potential presidential candidate, and we felt sure he'd be running in a future election.'

The site is currently running with a 'Work in Progress' page that promises more to come and, under the subhead 'positive dialogue to drive positive change', reads: 'Hi there, and welcome to the page. CJ and Charlie are two guys in a great relationship who are looking to inform our friends and family about some of the challenges we face being part of the LGBT community.

The couple said they bought the site because they saw their rights continually being challenged and 'felt sure' Bush (pictured) would be 'running in a future election'

'This page is intended to prompt understanding, insight, and healthy dialogue in the ever changing landscape of civil rights and social justice. Now we just need to find some time!' 

Bush publicly announced in December he was exploring the possibility of running a presidential campaign, and seemed to receive a boost last week when 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney said he would not run again. 

The former Florida governor's stance on LGBT issues has changed in the last 20 years. 

Bush was fiercely against gay rights in 1994, arguing in an editorial published by the Miami Herald that gay couples did not deserve legal protection.

In the same article, Bush said that 'sodomy' should be not be elevated 'to the same constitutional status as race and religion'. 

Bush's rhetoric has shifted recently, arguing last month that same-sex marriage is a 'state issue' and 'we have to respect the rule of the law'.

In a written statement, Bush said 'we can also show respect for the good people on all sides of the gay and lesbian issue', including 'couples making lifetime commitments to each other' and 'those of us who believe marriage is a sacrament'. 

Although Bush has not announced an official bid for the Republican nomination, Mr Phillips said multiple people have reached out to the couple attempting to buy the domain - including one person who wanted to purchase the site for a friend's birthday gift.  

A spokeswoman for Bush did not respond to an email from Business Insider asking if he has made any attempt to purchase JebBushForPresident.com.
