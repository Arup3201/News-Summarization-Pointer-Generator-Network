They have previously employed global star Bar Refaeli to model their underwear designs.

But to mark their 25th birthday, lingerie label Passionata offered 'real' women the chance to become models for the day.

As part of their quarter-century celebrations, they launched an online competition searching for four Brits to showcase their latest collection.

Cheers! Competition winners Josie Polington, 23, Hannah Galvin, 19, Jessica O, 23, and Katie Ireland, 23, all got to play models for the day to celebrate Passionata's 25th birthday

Strike a pose! Hannah, left and Jessica, right, pout and smile for the camera. Passionata UK held a birthday inspired shoot featuring four Passionata fans who won the opportunity to be models for the day

The
 competition was advertised on Facebook and asked fans to send in a 
picture of themselves 'embodying the Passionata spirit in their 
favourite lingerie set.'

The four lucky winners chosen were: Josie Polington, 23, Hannah Galvin, 19, Katie Ireland, 23, and Jessica O, 23.

The women were invited to a fun shoot where they were pictured enjoying a birthday tea party at the Watts Gallery tea shop in Guildford, Surrey. 

The shoot finished with the girls 
releasing 25 Passionata helium balloons into the air.

Passionata were founded in the Eighties in response to demand for less androgynous clothing that was in vogue at the time. The brand found the customers, 'wanted their femininity back.'

Passionata launched simple, elegant and flattering lingerie, moving on to slightly racier designs in the early 1990s. Think a flirty flounce on a garter belt or a daring neckline on a bodysuit - and lots of cleavage.

Ten years later, the infamous celebrity photographer David La Chapelle let loose his wild imagination on Passionata.

His
' Hot and Sexy Hollywood' campaign featured a femme fatale heroine in 
black satin Passionata underwear seductively riding a pink plastic 
horse.

Since 2010, Passionata have enlisted the services of 29-year-old supermodel Bar Rafaeli for its ad campaigns.

But for their birthday shoot, it was all about celebrating the women who have supported them over the years by buying and wearing their lingerie. They also want to give something back to their fans by offering a 25 per cent discount off their underwear for a limited time.
