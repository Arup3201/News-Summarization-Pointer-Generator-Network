A gallery worker has been jailed for stealing £28,000 worth of art from his employers including a book of paintings by Rolf Harris - which is now worthless.

Conman Matthew Dobson, 25, stole cash and goods from the Driftwood Gallery in Falmouth, Cornwall, at the end of 2012 and beginning of 2013, before Harris was publicly shamed as a sex abuser who took advantage of young girls. 

The haul included Harris's book of paintings, A Portrait of London, worth £225 at the time, Truro Crown Court heard.

Dobson also diverted the gallery's money into his own accounts and wrote fake invoices before bosses spotted him trying to sell the stolen art on eBay and reported him to the police. 

The court heard how Dobson had already served a 16-month jail sentence for swindling £34,000 from his previous employer.

When he left prison he needed to raise £8,000 to repay his debts and decided target his new workplace.

Terry Eastwood, defending, said: 'He decided, very unwisely, that he would steal from his employer again. He didn't stop however at £8,000.' 

Dobson's haul also included five works by leading Welsh artist Kerry Darlington. 

He pleaded guilty to 17 charges of theft and fraud between 2012 and 2013 and asked for 37 more to be taken into consideration.

Recorder Jeremy Wright jailed him for two years and ordered him to pay a £120 victim surcharge.

Experts say that Harris's artworks - which once fetched up to £70,000 each - are now worthless because of his crimes. 

He was jailed for five years and nine months for using his celebrity status to grope and abuse young women and girls over a 40-year period.

In 2005 the former TV presenter had the rare privilege of painting a portrait of the Queen to mark her 80th birthday.

After being unveiled in December that year, the portrait, which took Harris two months to complete, initially went on display at the Queen's Gallery in Buckingham Palace.

The whereabouts of the painting is currently unknown. 

Around the time of his July conviction, a woman spoke of how a £28,000 Harris painting she bought had lost 90 per cent of its value.

Sara Gardiner, 35, invested her life savings in Horses At The Lights months before he was arrested, The Sun reported.

She said at the time: 'I'm sick that I bought the work of such an evil man and gutted that it's now not going to be worth the canvas it's painted on.'
