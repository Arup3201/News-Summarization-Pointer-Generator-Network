When Leicester brought Steve Mafi over to England in 2010, he had been released by the Sydney-based Waratahs, amid concerns about his inability to add bulk to a naturally lean frame.

His career was going nowhere in a hurry, but that has all changed. The Tigers helped him put on weight the right way and he was a revelation in their pack; as an athletic, versatile lock or flanker.

Having grown up Down Under in a Tongan family, he was duly picked to represent the Pacific-island nation and has gone on to earn 10 Test caps. Yet, having last made an international appearance in June, he may next re-surface in the gold shirt of the Wallabies.

Gone: Former Leicester forward Steve Mafi has left for Australia to try and pursue a career with the Wallabies

Dual: Mafi has already played for Tonga, however, raising the possibility of international-level transfer window

Mafi didn’t return to Leicester for pre-season and despite still being contracted to the East Midlands club, he signed for Western Force in Perth. There were family reasons, but also a wish to play for Australia. That is hardly outrageous given that he was born and raised there, but it shouldn’t be possible because he has already been capped by another country.

But the goalposts have shifted, paving the way for an alarming transformation of the Test rugby landscape. In time, there could be an international-level transfer market, with players willingly auctioning themselves to the highest bidder.

Over the summer, it emerged that Steffon Armitage could play for France if England continue to ignore him. The Toulon flanker may have the option to capitalise on a loophole in the IRB’s eligibility criteria designed to enhance the Sevens tournament at the 2016 Rio Olympics.

Players who have represented one country are no longer exempt from representing another, providing they have the requisite passport and have not been capped for 18 months. This amendment was doubtless put in place with the best intentions of aiding smaller nations, but the result is sure to be an unseemly farce.

Star man: Steffon Armitage, who has already been capped by England, could yet play for France in the future

Prepare for widespread abuse of a highly vulnerable ‘system’. Mafi can qualify for Australia in time for the OIympics, then go on to chase 15-a-side selection. Meanwhile, Tonga lose a top player to a richer rival.

French rugby is awash with foreign talent and ‘Les Bleus’ are struggling so much that there will be a growing temptation to cynically recruit overseas players; capped or not. It is just a matter of patience and using lawyers to drive a tank through feeble regulations. One day, England may consider the ploy too. For the right fee and paperwork, Japan could hire their very own All Black.

Tonga, Fiji and Samoa rely on players with dual citizenship, many of whom will carry New Zealand passports. When a rookie sensation emerges in the colours of one of those countries, what is to stop them being poached? A committee will be tasked with preventing malpractice, so the long-term welfare of the Test game may be reliant on anonymous ‘suits’ and the juggling of myriad agendas.

Rugby’s eligibility criteria were already too lax, without this short-cut to chaos. A can of worms is wide open. 

Way out: A loophole exists in the IRB's eligibility rules whereby players can switch after a sevens tournament

Kicking off the season with a bang 

The new season is destined to begin with an almighty bang. At Franklin’s Gardens on Friday night, revamped Gloucester will set about inflicting an early blow to Northampton’s hopes of retaining their Aviva Premiership title.

Two head-to-head duels stand out. England hooker Dylan Hartley faces the man he would have challenged for the Lions No 2 shirt, if a ban hadn’t deprived him of a tour place; Richard Hibbard of Wales. In midfield, Luther Burrell and Billy Twelvetrees will aim to out-do each other in a preliminary audition for the inside-centre berth in the national team.

Title: Defending Premiership champions Northampton kick off their defence by hosting Gloucester on Friday

On Saturday, the annual London Double Header will draw a vast curtain-raiser crowd to Twickenham.

Yet, it is not just the top flight that will generate opening-weekend intrigue. The Championships starts with a heavyweight clash between Bristol and Worcester at Ashton Gate. Barring a play-off upset, those two ambitious clubs are destined to resolve a seismic scrap for promotion in the two-leg final next May.

Debut: Wales and British and Irish Lions hooker James Hibbard will make his debut for Gloucester on Friday

Simpson-Daniel's premature retirement a loss for the game 

James Simpson-Daniel has been forced by injure to retire prematurely, at the age of 32, and the domestic game will be substantially poorer for his absence.

Since he left Jonah Lomu choking in his vapour trails at Twickenham as a precocious teen prospect in 2002, medical setbacks contrived to deprive ‘Sinbad’ of the higher recognition which his talent surely justified. A tally of 10 Test caps does nothing to reflect the majesty of his game as an electric attacking runner. 

In a sport with a modern template founded on size and power, here was an impish free spirit capable of making a mockery of the giants around him. He stayed true to Gloucester throughout his career and at Kingsholm, where strong forward play is so revered, they will sorely miss his audacious class. 

Premature: Gloucester back James Simpson-Daniel, 32, was forced to retire last week due to injury

Missed: Simpson-Daniel will a loss to the game as he was an exciting back who scored tries from everywhere

Cyclist drawn into French rugby storm 

A French cyclist has been inadvertently dragged into an unseemly public row between the presidents of Toulon and Racing Metro.

Prior to last weekend’s clash between their sides, Mourad Boudjellal – the outspoken millionaire who has bank-rolled Toulon – likened his Parisian counterpart, Jacky Lorenzetti, to Raymond Poulidor; known as ‘Eternal Second’ after failing to win the Tour de France despite eight podium finishes.

Old school: French cyclist Raymond Poulidor (second left) was used as a comparison by Toulon's president

The riposte was a blatant accusation that European champions Toulon break salary-cap rules, as Lorenzetti, said: ‘The Top 14 cannot be a competition where 13 teams play by the rules of the salary cap and Toulon play by their own rules

'Clear answers – clear like the water in the bottles of virtuous cyclists – need to be provided by Toulon and their president. No club, not even the champions, should play with a doped wage budget.’ Touche…

Last Word

On the basis that there’s no such thing as bad publicity, World Cup organisers will be ecstatic.

A video promoting imminent ticket sales for the tournament – featuring actor Charles Dance giving a team talk in a changing-room at Twickenham – has generated a distant storm of indignation, leading to wider coverage. Dance’s motivational address is directed at players past and present, fans, ground staff, musicians and even a chef tending a barbecue.

Many nationalities are represented, but not New Zealand. This has been perceived as such a colossal snub by Kiwis that All Black players and coaches have been asked for comment. Apparently, not enough respect has been shown to the world champions.

Head-to-head: Southa Africa and Canada rugby stars face off in each other in the promotional video

Passionate: Games of Throne star Charles Dance gives a rousing pep talk in the 2015 World Cup video

Ironically, the video is entitled ‘Too Big to Miss’, which New Zealanders evidently believe should refer to them, not the tournament. There is no sign of any Argentines, Fijians, Japanese or Georgians either, but those countries appear to have taken the oversight in stride.

This column can reassure all Kiwis; your team are the world’s best and will be rightly feted here next year, but the sport is about far more than just those fabled black shirts and the Haka.
