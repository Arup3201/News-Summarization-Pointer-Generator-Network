Guilty: Stephen Smith was found guilty of attacking Ms Green by a jury at Gloucester crown court and told by the judge a prison sentence was 'inevitable'

A woman was viciously attacked in her own home because she had hacked into another woman's Facebook account.

Donna Green was sending messages on the other woman's Facebook page when Stephen Smith arrived at her home to stop her.

Mr Smith, 44, of Matson, Gloucester, beat up Ms Green, punching her repeatedly, and tried to rob her of her computer, the jury was told, leaving her battered and covered in blood.

Mr Smith, a friend of the other 
woman, denied attempted robbery, assaulting Ms Green causing her actual 
bodily harm and damaging her front door handle and a glass photo frame.

But the jury convicted him of all three charges last week.

Judge Michael Harington warned 
him that a prison sentence seemed 'inevitable' when he is sentenced.

Ms Green told the court she was at
home in Coney Hill, Gloucester, on the evening of February 1 and had 
logged into the Facebook account of a woman she claimed was using drugs 
and abusing her children.

She admitted she had obtained the other woman's Facebook password and was using her account as if she was her.

‘She was an old school friend but she had some of her children in care because she had hit them,' said Ms Green alleged.

‘She was not very nice to her kids
so I was keeping an eye on her. She was also using a drug called M-Cat.
I had threatened her with social services because her kids were at 
risk,’ she said in court.

‘But while I was on her account I started receiving messages which were not very nice,’ she said.

Ms Green said she received about 
20 messages, mostly from the same person, but there were a few which 
were from Stephen Smith which said 'I am watching you,' she said.

‘He threatened to deal with me if I went on her account again.'

A few minutes later, she said, she
logged off and was getting ready to go out to her father's 60th 
birthday party when she realised Mr Smith was in her home.

‘He came running at me and hitting
me, full strength,’ she said. ‘He pushed me onto a glass topped table 
in my living room and started punching me.

‘As he hit me he was telling me to
delete the woman's profile. I managed to run to my bedroom and I tried 
to lock myself in but he overpowered me. He got me on the floor and laid
into me. He kept punching and punching and punching.

‘I told him I couldn't breathe 
because he had all his bodyweight on me. I thought I was going to die. 
He said 'I don't want you to f***ing breathe.'

‘I tried to get away and run to 
the front door but he started stamping all over my head and punching me.
He must have punched me 25 times.

‘My dog was so scared by what was happening that he weed all over the floor.’

Ms Green said Smith picked up a glass framed photo and hit her with it.

‘He kept telling me to delete the 
Facebook profile but then he said he would do it himself and he picked 
up my PC tower. I screamed at him to give it back and he dropped it as 
he got into his van and sped away.’

The jury saw pictures of her blood
covered face and injured eyes. 

In testimony Ms Green said an optician 
had told her she would have lasting damage to her right eye, ‘Ever since
the incident I have suffered with headaches and I have double vision’, 
she added.

Under cross-examination Ms Green 
admitted she had changed the woman's Facebook password and was making 
comments which others would believe came from the woman.

‘Do you think that was an acceptable way to carry on?’ Sarah Jenkins, defending, asked. ‘No, I don't,’ replied Ms Green.

But she said she had done it to gather information about the other woman which she could present to social services.

Ms Jenkins suggested that Ms Green
also intended to make trouble for Mr Smith with his girlfriend by 
claiming he was having a relationship with the other woman. She denied 
that.

Mr Smith claimed to the jury that 
he had been attacked by Ms Green when he went to her home to ask her to 
stop using the other woman's Facebook identity. He claimed he acted in 
self-defence when she attacked him.
