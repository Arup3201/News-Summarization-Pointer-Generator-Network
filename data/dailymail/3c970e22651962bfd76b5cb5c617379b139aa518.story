A Florida department store has come under fire for placing a sign in the children's department asking Santa for 'a big fat bank account and a slim body'. 

The sign, propped up between girl mannequins, reads: 'Dear Santa, This year please give me a big fat bank account and a slim body. Please don't mix those two up like you did last year. Thanks.'

A horrified mother posted an image of the sign she saw at a Dillard's store in the Wellington Green Mall near Palm Beach, and the photo has since been shared nearly 400 times.

Mother-of-three Julie Khanna wrote that she was 'appalled' when she spotted the sign.  

Thoughtless: A mother spotted this sign at a children's clothing department and shared it online

The sign reads: 'Dear Santa, This year please give me a big fat bank account and a slim body. Please don't mix those two up like you did last year. Thanks', which parents said sent the wrong message to children

'This is NOT the message we should be sending our girls!!' she wrote on Facebook as she posted the image.

'I hope Dillard's will consider removing these display signs and anything else that reduces our daughters to irrelevant numbers. We don't bully our kids about their weight or size, so why should we let Dillard's?'

She added that she spoke to a manager who agreed to take it down temporarily but that she would need the store manager's approval to remove it permanently.

'It's kinda funny because a women who wants to wish for that should make it happen for herself,' Florida shopper Sally Stewart told WPTV. 

Outrage: Mother-of-three Julie Khanna, pictured with her husband, shared the image to her Facebook page as she called for Dillard's to remove the sign. Her post has now been shared hundreds of times

'What would a little girl want with a bank account? It gives the wrong message about having a slim body. That's not the message we want to give our kids.'

Since the outrage across social media, the store has said that the sign - meant as a joke for adults - was placed in the children's department accidentally.

The sign has since been removed from all departments across their 299 stores, WPTV reported. 

'It's time for retailers to stop making a joke out of women's body image,' Dr. Robyn Silverman, a body image expert, told Yahoo Parenting. 

Taking action: Dillard's said it has now removed the sign from all departments across all of its 299 stores

'Every time we receive a message like this - and we do over and over and over again - it hammers home the message that the most important thing to wish for is a thin body.

'We want our children to realize that the most important thing about them is who they are - their character, strength, and what they bring to the table. Their body is a vehicle to relay these gifts, it is not who they are.'
