These are the gruesome party pictures a 23-year-old mother-of-three posted on Facebook just days before she shot herself dead.

Cynthia Lee, of Michigan, appears alongside a scythe-wielding joker in the Halloween promotional photos - her friend holding the weapon close to her throat, both of them splattered in blood.

The photos emerged after it was revealed she had updated her status on the networking site moments before she killed herself.

She said 'I can't handle this s*** anymore' and added that her pain was 'too strong to handle any longer'.

Cynthia was reportedly having difficulty dealing with the loss of her mother and the recent arrest of her partner.

farewell message also accuses her father of being a 'good for nothing 
drug cheating loser' and stated that he was not to attend her funeral.

She
goes on to express her love for a male friend named Ryan Jason 
Hardwick, who was reportedly jailed for a parole violation by writing: 'im so sorry for hurting you just know U R MY TRUE LOVE.'
