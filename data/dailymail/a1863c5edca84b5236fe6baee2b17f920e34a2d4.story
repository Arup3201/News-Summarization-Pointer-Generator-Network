The bi-racial parents of a six-year-old who starred in a Cheerios advert have hit back against racists, saying they need to accept: 'We are part of the face of America'.

Cheerios was forced to restrict online comments after posting the commercial on YouTube earlier this month, after a barrage of negative and racist comments.

Christopher Colbert has reacted to the abuse aimed at his daughter Grace after she appeared in the national advert, saying: 'America needs to see this is just a way of life.'

Debate: Christopher and Janet Colbert talk about the reaction to Grace appearing in a Cheerios advert

Two weeks after the advert was aired - sparking a nationwide debate about mixed-race families - the Colberts talked to MSNBC about their experiences.

Mr Colbert said: 'I wasn't upset or anything. I was pretty much really excited about having this type of reaction so we could see where we still stand in America.'

He added that the first few comments on the online version of the advert had been good, before negative comments started to appear.

The advert has been viewed more than 3.4 million times on YouTube.

Before the comments were removed, 1,900 viewers had given the advert the thumbs down and, according to AdWeek, the site contained numerous references to Nazis, 'troglodytes' and 'racial genocide'.

The commercial features a mixed-race girl asking her white mother if Cheerios are good for the heart before running out of the kitchen when she is told that they are. The shot then cuts to her black father waking from a nap to find a pile of Cheerios on his chest.

The racist response to the advert has led to a debate about attitudes to mixed-race families.

Abuse: The Cheerios advert starring Grace attracted racist abuse because it shows a mixed-race family 

Reality: Cheerios chose to portray a mixed-race family to reflect the changing look of families in the U.S

A blogger on Jezebel wrote: '[It] is a huge step for interracial families like mine who want to be seen in public together and maybe eat some heart healthy snacks but it validates the existence of biracial and multiracial people.'

And, in an opinion piece in Time magazine, the debate was described as being a sign of progress, MSNBC said.

Mr Colbert said: 'There's many other things that we could talk about in America, but this still being an issue, people having a problem with whom I choose to love or whom you choose to love, it shouldn't be an issue any more.'

He added that the debate around Grace's advert was exciting 'so we know what to look at and how to move forward and become a better America'.

After stopping comments on the advert, the cereal company defended it decision to show a bi-racial family.

'At Cheerios, we know there are many kinds of families and we celebrate them all,' Camille Gibson, the vice-president of marketing at General Mills said.

'We were trying to portray an American family  and there are lots of multi-cultural families in America today.'

Unfazed: Christopher Colbert with Grace, who believes the attention was caused by her smile

Data from federal surveys backs this up. Figures show there were 650,000 inter-racial married couples in 1980 but by 2009 that had risen to 2.5 million.

For all the debate however, six-year-old Grace seems unfazed by the attention. She said filming the commercial had been fun, and that her school friends had seen it.

When she asked her daughter about the attention her advert was receiving, Mrs Colbert said: '[Grace] actually just thought the attention was because she had a great smile. So she really had no idea.'
