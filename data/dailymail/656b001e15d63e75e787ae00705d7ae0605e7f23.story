Sir David Nicholson has been forced to apologise to an NHS executive after posting a parody video portraying him as Hitler.

Sir David tweeted the YouTube clip which mocked the new NHS data-sharing project headed by Tim Kelsey, and hit out at Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt.

The video, another internet parody on a scene from the movie Downfall, puts English subtitles to the German actors, attributing Hitler's 'words' to Mr Kelsey.

NHS boss Sir David Nicholson has to apologise to another executive after posting a spoof video which portrayed him as Hitler

In the clip, Hitler, referred to as Mr Kelsey, the NHS national director for patients and information., gets told that the new care.data project is not going to plan.

Sir David quickly removed the link to the YouTube clip, and apologised to Mr Kelsey, making sure he put a kiss on the end to make amends.

‘Sorry this is what happens when you give an old bloke with an over developed sense of humour new tech,’ he told M Kelsey.

‘You're doing a great job X’, he added.

Date of birth, postcode, NHS number and gender are to be included in the new care.data record which was due to be introduced by NHS England in April. 

Spoof: English subtitles has been added to the famous climax scene from the German film Downfall about the last days of Hitler

In the video, instead of addressing Hitler, the German SS generals address 'Mr Kelsey'

It has now been delayed until later this year after critics warned patients had been kept in the dark about how their data will be used outside the NHS.

Titled ‘Tim Kelsey discovers that care.data is in trouble’, the video has had more than 3,000 hits since it was posted to YouTube earlier this week.

In it, the subtitled words of the actor playing Hitler - identified as Mr Kelsey - state that the project has ‘always been about making money’.

‘Who cares about ordinary people, they never understand things,’ it shows him saying.

‘They don't have my vision for a better world’

Sir David acknowledged that it was wrong to link to a video which portrays another NHS executive as Adolf Hitler, and said sorry to Tim Kelsey

In the video, Mr Kelsey, speaking as Hitler, is mocking 'ordinary people' for protesting against the new data sharing project

The joke video also hits out at  Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, accusing him of 'hiding behind a tree' over NHS's care.data project

It attacks ‘scaremongering’ data privacy campaigners and has him saying: ‘People didn't care when we sold off their NHS, they barely blinked’

At one point he is shown suggesting everything is OK because ‘Jeremy Hunt is right behind us’.

But he is then told: ‘Jeremy Hunt is hiding behind a tree. The Government is saying nothing. They are all hiding behind trees.’

Responding
 on the social media site, Mr Kelsey said: ‘My view on the YouTube film:
 funny but we risk underestimating how important data-sharing is for the
 NHS. Hitler was not a joke.’

A
 spokesperson for NHS England said: ‘Sir David very much hopes his tweet
 did not cause any offence, that was not his intention at all.

Both the link to the video and Sir David's Twitter exchange with Mr Kelsey has been removed

‘He knows his team is doing a really important and complex job for patients, one which is critical for the NHS.’

Sir David, who resisted a sustained and virulent campaign for him to resign or be sacked over the Mid Staffordshire scandal, is due to retire as chief executive of NHS England next month.

Shadow health minister Andrew Gwynne told the Evening Standard: ‘There can be no excuse for showing Jeremy Hunt and his top officials in such an offensive video.’

Conservative MP Charlotte Leslie added: ‘This is absolutely shocking.

‘He has done a very good job in portraying complete contempt not only for a co-worker but also the Secretary of State who has been so loyally defending him.

‘This is another reason why he should have gone a long time ago.’
