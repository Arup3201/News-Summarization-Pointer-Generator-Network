With less than a week of the transfer window to go, clubs will be trying to tie up deals to get the players they want.

Here Sportsmail looks at 10 transfers all football fans want to see happen before the February 2 deadline.  

Ezequiel Lavezzi - Paris Saint-Germain to Liverpool - £12m

The 29-year-old striker has reportedly fallen out of favour with PSG coach Laurent Blanc and wants a move away from France. Liverpool sent scouts to watch the 1-0 win over St Etienne on Sunday but Lavezzi only played nine minutes after coming on as a late substitute.

The only stumbling block to any potential move is the fact that Lavezzi wants to play Champions League football - something Liverpool can't guarantee.

Yevhen Konoplyanka - Dnipro to Everton - £7m

The 25-year-old winger is wanted by Everton and Tottenham, as well as Roma. Everton have asked but been told Konoplyanka is close to joining Spurs. However, the London club want to wait until the summer for a deal when the player is out of contract and Everton may be able to steal him away if they offer Dnipro enough money in the next week.

Marquinhos - PSG to Manchester United - £60m

Louis van Gaal is an admirer of the 20-year-old centre back and United have asked about his availability. United value the Brazilian at £30m but PSG have told them to beat the £50m they paid for David Luiz from Chelsea. 

With United's defence still adjusting to Van Gaal's tactics and the race for the Champions League heating up, the Dutchman may be tempted to put in a world-record bid for a defender to boost his chances of recording a successful first season at Old Trafford.

James McCarthy - Everton to Tottenham - £25m

Tottenham like the 24-year-old midfielder but will have to put in a mega offer to tempt Everton to sell a player Roberto Martinez brought with him from Wigan.

Arsenal were primed with a bid before January but realised it would take at least £25m and Tottenham have considered offering Aaron Lennon and Younes Kaboul plus money, but it still may fall short this month.

Dimitar Berbatov - Monaco to QPR - £1m

The former Manchester United and Monaco striker reportedly wants to leave France and return to the Premier League due to a lack of playing time. 

The enigmatic 33-year-old could provide the lift QPR need in their fight against relegation. 

Dimitar Berbatov is handsomely paid in the principality but is wanted by a raft of Premier League clubs

James Milner - Manchester City to Liverpool - £8m

Liverpool have predominately focused on bringig in younger players but Brendan Rodgers is a fan of the Manchester City midfielder, who is refusing to sign a new contract. 

City are increasingly worried that the 29-year-old may leave at the end of the season on a free and could be tempted to sell this January.

Kevin de Bruyne - Wolfsburg to Manchester City - £30m

The former Chelsea man has blossomed since moving back to Germany, so much so that his international team-mate Vincent Kompany has urged City to buy him. 

With their title challenge faltering, Manuel Pellegrini has splashed the cash on £28m Wilfried Bony but De Bruyne will provide added creativity from midfield that City have been lacking.

Petr Cech - Chelsea to Liverpool - £7m

Much of Liverpool's problems this season have stemmed from the mistakes of Simon Mignolet in goal and they have been linked with a host of keepers this window.

The 32-year-old Cech's agent certainly hasn't played down a move to Anfield, but with Mark Schwarzer having already left Stamford Bridge this month a deal looks more likely in the summer. 

Liverpool need a keeper and can't afford any more mistakes if they want Champions League football next season, which may force them to act quickly.

Memphis Depay - PSV to Tottenham - £16m

The Dutch winger shot to prominence after an impressive World Cup last summer and has also been linked with a reunion with Van Gaal at Manchester United. 

Tottenham are keen to sign the 20-year-old before the end of the window, however, having missed out on him last year.

Diego de Girolamo - Sheffield United to Juventus FREE

The Italy Under 20 international is out of contract in the summer and has so far not signed a new deal offered to him by the club.

Scouts have been watching the 19-year-old play for United's Under 20s and during his two loan spells at York. Italian scouts saw him score against Germany and he has been recommended to Serie A leaders Juventus. 

Sheffield United have offered a new contract to their highly-rated teenager Diego de Girolamo
