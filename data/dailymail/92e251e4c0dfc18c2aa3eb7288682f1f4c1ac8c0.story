Shocking footage has emerged of a group of taxi drivers allegedly buying and smoking drugs before heading out to pick up passengers.

In an exclusive A Current Affair investigation, four different cab drivers are seen  pulling up in the same street on several occasions and make a quick trip to the suspected drug house.

The video appears to capture the drivers, in their work uniforms, brazenly smoking in their cars in broad daylight or the middle of the night in the west Melbourne suburb of Sunshine, while littering the ground with discarded sheets of burnt foil.

Shocking footage has emerged of cab drivers apparently smoking ice before they hit the streets on their job

While observing the footage, drug and substance abuse expert from the Penington Institute John Ryan told the show it was likely the men were using methamphetamine, known as ice.

‘The vapour we saw in the video disappears quickly which is not typical of cigarette smokers – it’s a much more cloudy smoke from cigarettes than what it is say from an ice pipe,’ he told A Current Affair.

In the footage, one cab driver is seen making a stop at a suspected drug house before he picked up a ‘friend’ and make their way to a busy shopping centre down the road.

Former drug addict John Shaw told A Current Affair that he is 99 percent certain the men were smoking ice after viewing the footage.

‘You can see by the flame, at the bottom from the reflection of the windscreen that he’s heating up – you need to heat it up to melt it a little bit – it comes in crystallised form,’ he said.

Shaw was hooked on ice for nine months and revealed how the drug affected his life and how it affects the minds of users.

‘There's no way you could be under the speed limit and on ice because the adrenaline that goes through your body is way too high,’ he said.

‘You’re more likely to speed on the road because your mind is all over the place and you think of weird different things all at once so you can’t focus on anything.

‘Fatigue sets in very quickly – once again your concentration level is low, well, next to nothing.’

In another piece of footage, the same car returns to the street with two passengers while the cab driver is seen making his way into the suspected drug house before driving around the corner.

Moments later, another man from another car is seen getting into the backseat of the car, with a sheet of foil in his hands. After spending some time in the car, the man gets out, while openly holding the foil in his hand and a pipe sticking out of his mouth.

An hour later, the same cab driver is spotted back at the house and he drives to a nearby street shortly after to meet with another cabbie as he jumps into the vehicle. Not long afterwards, the cab driver is seen picking up passengers.

A Melbourne woman, who wished to not be named, told A Current Affair that she has constantly witnessed the same taxi drivers rolling up on her street and in front of the same suspected drug house for the past five months.

‘I thought maybe they were residents of the flats across the road but that had become very evident - there is a dealer,’ she told A Current Affair.

‘I’ve seen these taxi drivers pulling up to the drug house, doing the deal, take off aggressively into the other street, smoking the drug and then just littering the burnt foil out onto the street.

‘We’re not talking about one user – we’re talking about multiple users.'

She also added that she has brought the matter up with the local authorities and even called triple zero but 'no one attended'.

A Taxi Services Commission spokesperson said the company ‘will take enforcement action against drivers found to be participating in illegal activities and putting passenger’s safety at risk'

Ice, also known as methamphetamine or crystal meth, has shot to the top of Australia's crime enforcement agenda, with the Australian Crime Commission declaring the country is in the grips of an 'ice pandemic'.

The drug, believed to be more addictive than heroin, can quickly cause brain damage comparable to Alzheimer’s disease, as well as violently psychotic behaviour and delusional paranoia.

Victorian Minister for Public Transport Terry Mulder said in a statement there are 'strict penalties in Victoria, requiring all commercial drivers to be alcohol and drug free when they are driving'.

'The Napthine Government has recently announced that it will more than double the amount of random drug testing in Victoria from 40,000 to 100,000 a year.'

A Taxi Services Commission spokesperson said the company ‘will take enforcement action against drivers found to be participating in illegal activities and putting passenger’s safety at risk'.

‘Taxi drivers found using illicit drugs while at work are likely to be subject to disciplinary action which may result in the suspension and/or cancellation of their driver accreditation by TSC. They may also be subject to criminal charges by Victoria police.'
