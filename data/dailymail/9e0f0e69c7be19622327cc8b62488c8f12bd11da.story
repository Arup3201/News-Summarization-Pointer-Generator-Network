A 20-month-old baby boy fell into a pit of sludge and excrement after trying to use a public toilet.

Firefighters were called to rescue the toddler as he lay floundering in the pit in Yanji, north east China.

Chinese loos are typically a hole in the ground.

Still potty training, the boy had lost his balance and screamed for his mother as he tumbled into a pool of sewage.

The 20-month-old boy from Yanji, in China's Jilin province, tumbled into the pit when he failed to keep his balance

The boy wailed and screamed as he struggled to stand up in the mess.

In a desperate bid to help her child, the mother was found holding a rake down so that he could hold onto it and keep his head above the slurry.

One firefighter had to squeeze himself through the gap wearing a breathing mask to get to the infant.

Once down, he held the boy up so his colleagues to could pull him to safety.

Aside from feeling somewhat traumatised, the hospital confirmed he did not suffer any injuries in the ordeal.

In China, children are given crotchless underwear before they are old enough to be able to use a toilet.

Due to the nature of the lavatories, it is difficult for young children to keep their balance.
