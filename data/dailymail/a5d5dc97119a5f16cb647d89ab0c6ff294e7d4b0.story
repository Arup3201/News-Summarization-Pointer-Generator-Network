The Australian radio host who was part of the notorious royal radio prank call to the Duchess of Cambridge's London Hospital has been ordered not to send a condolence message to the family of the nurse who later committed suicide.

Mel Greig was said today to be anxious to send a sorrowful message to the family of nurse Jacintha Saldanha but her employers at Southern Cross Austereo have told her to make contact with them.

Miss Greig was seen in public for the first time this weekend when, after weeks in hiding, she flew back to her home town of Adelaide to celebrate her 31st birthday with 40 family members and friends in a private room in the city's Hackney Hotel.

She was photographed arriving at the hotel with boyfriend Steven Pollock, but said she was sorry that she had nothing further to say about the incident that made headlines around the world.

In the prank call, she and fellow radio host Mike Christian pretended to be the Queen and Prince Charles when they phoned the Prince Edward VII hospital and were put through to the Duchess's ward.

'I'm just happy to be back in Adelaide to see my family and friends for my birthday,' said Miss Greig, declining to speak further about the hoax call which duped a nurse into revealing details of Kate Middleton's morning sickness.

Three days later, nurse Jacintha Saldanha, who had put the call through to the private ward, committed suicide.

A close friend told Adelaide's Sunday 
Mail today that the once-bubbly presenter was still shattered following 
the death of Miss Saldanha and was frustrated that she was unable to 
seek 'proper closure'.

'It's been really hard for her to move on,' the friend told the paper.

'She hasn't been able to tell the 
Saldanha family how sorry she is for their loss and I think that's made 
it really hard for her.'

The friend added: 'Mel wanted to send a condolence letter to the family since this happened but she hasn't been allowed to send it and it really upsets her.'

Desperate to keep out of the limelight, Miss Greig attended her birthday at the hotel yesterday after it was booked under the name 'Lem's Birthday' – Lem being Mel spelled backwards.

A family member who asked not to be named said that while Miss Greig would like to return to radio work, and felt ready for the task, nothing had been confirmed.

'She's still waiting for her work to offer a decent job for her to return to,' said the family member.'

'It's pretty stressful for her. Mel lost her dream job,' said the family member, referring to Miss Greig's former Sydney-based show, Hot30, which she co-hosted with Mr Christian.

The Sunday Mail said it was being suggested that the radio network was considering offering her a breakfast slot on an Adelaide radio station.
