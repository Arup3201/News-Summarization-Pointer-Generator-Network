Peter Thomas Maine, 56, from Wynyard, Stockton-on-Tees, who was found dead with stab wounds near a sports centre in Durham City yesterday morning

A solicitor who faced being struck off over ‘dubious’ transactions has been found stabbed to death.

Peter Thomas Maine, 56, was found dead just four months after being told he would be prosecuted before the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal.

Police have launched a ‘murder-style’ investigation after the father-of-two was discovered near a popular running track on Sunday morning.

It is understood he sustained fatal stab wounds but police have not found the weapon that inflicted the injuries.

They are currently treating the death as ‘suspicious’ but ‘unexplained’ and do not yet know whether a third party was involved.

Mr Maine lived with his wife Joanna, 53, in Wynyard, a leafy gated estate in Stockton-on-Tees, County Durham.

Their £650,000 house is near the palatial mansion which Dragon’s Den star Duncan Bannatyne recently put on the market.

The couple have two grown-up daughters, Lucy, 25, and Jessica, 22.

Last night, his family said in a statement: ‘Peter was a loving husband to Joanna, a devoted father to

Lucy and Jessica and a much loved son of George and brother to Helen.

‘Words at this time cannot express how we, his family, are feeling. We would ask that anyone with information regarding what happened to Peter to please contact Durham Constabulary.

‘This is a very difficult time for us his loving family and we request that we be afforded privacy in order to try and come to terms with our very sad loss.’

Mr Maine was discovered just before 8am on Sunday morning on a path near a running track at Maiden Castle Sports Centre, Durham City.

He was wearing blue tracksuit bottoms, trainers and a short-sleeved black running top and had parked his black Range Rover Discovery in Old Elvet, a nearby street, just before 7.30am.

Detectives have confirmed that Mr Maine had suffered stab wounds, but said the cause of the injuries was still not clear.

Yesterday, the area was still cordoned off as officers from specialist search teams, including Northumbria Police’s marine unit, carry out extensive searches of the river and its banks.

Officers said they were currently looking to speak to a young man and woman who had been camping near the spot where Mr Maine was discovered and may hold vital information.

They believe the pair were collected by a relative near the Maiden Castle car park on Sunday morning at about the time emergency services may have been arriving at the scene.

Detective Inspector Lyn Peart of Durham Police said: ‘We would specially like to hear from any rowers, dog walkers, cyclists and runners who use this area frequently.

‘We are treating Mr Maine’s death as suspicious, however it does remain unexplained and we would appeal to the public for assistance.’

Mr Maine joined the Law Society in 1981 and specialised in civil litigation, commercial property, conveyancing, family law and personal injury.

Suspicion: A legal watchdog said it was alleged that he ¿acted as a solicitor in relation to transactions concerning a company which he ought to have known were dubious¿

In April, he was notified by the Solicitors Regulation Authority he would be prosecuted over ‘dubious’ transactions.

The regulator said it was alleged that he ‘acted as a solicitor in relation to transactions concerning a company which he ought to have known were dubious’.

It added that the alleged action may have compromised his independence, integrity or duty to his clients.

The allegation was in connection to his work at Hall & Co LLP based at Easington Colliery, which closed as a firm in 2011.

A spokesperson added yesterday: ‘There is no public interest whatsoever in proceeding with these actions and so they will be discontinued.’
