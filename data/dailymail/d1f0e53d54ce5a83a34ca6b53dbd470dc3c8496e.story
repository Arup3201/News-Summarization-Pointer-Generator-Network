Louis van Gaal has demanded more from Robin van Persie after telling the misfiring Manchester United striker that he had ‘a very bad game’ against Arsenal last weekend.

Van Persie was replaced at the Emirates for the fourth time this season having had only 13 touches of the ball. With Radamel Falcao set to return to the squad against Hull City on Saturday and young James Wilson on standby for a start, the Dutchman’s place is under threat.

‘You can count his touches of the ball and I do think that 13 is (too) few,’ said the United manager.

‘More importantly is how he’s playing. It was a very bad game from him and that is why I changed him.

‘When I change players it is normally because they are doing something not good. Every player has to fight for his position.’

Van Persie has struggled for form since firing United to the title in Sir Alex Ferguson’s final season, scoring 26 Premier League goals following a £24million move from Arsenal.

The 31-year-old’s form dipped under David Moyes last season and hopes that he would be rejuvenated by the arrival of his old Holland coach have faded after a modest return of three goals in 11 games.

There are concerns that Van Persie has lost a yard of pace but Van Gaal questioned whether a lack of confidence might also be to blame. 

He said: ‘It’s a question also of confidence, maybe a question of scoring a wonderful goal at the right moment. You know how strikers are, they have to score goals. They feel like that, it’s not that I’m asking that.’

Falcao is available for the first time in more than a month after recovering from a calf injury but the Colombian lacks match fitness and Van Gaal could turn to Wilson, who will be 19 on Monday.

Wilson marked his senior debut by scoring twice against Hull in the corresponding fixture in May and it is understood that he has been told to expect to start on Saturday or against Stoke on Tuesday.

Asked if Wilson is ready, Van Gaal said: ‘I shall not say. You shall see if I give him that confidence.’

The manager refused to enthuse over the win at Arsenal, even though it lifted United into fourth place.

‘The performance was not the performance that shall give us a lot of confidence,’ said Van Gaal, who could include Marcos Rojo in his squad less than a month after the defender dislocated his shoulder in the Manchester derby.

‘We have to be fourth at the end of the league — now is not so important. We have to beat our opponents more easily.’
