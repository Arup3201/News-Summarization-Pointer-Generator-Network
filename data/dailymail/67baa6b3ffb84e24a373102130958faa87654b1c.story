A Texas junior high school teacher is facing charges after allegedly being caught having an improper relationship with one of her students.

Heather Lynn Miller, 46, was allegedly found in her classroom with the 14-year-old boy on Sunday by a police officer patrolling the campus.

She was arrested around 7:30pm Sunday on campus.

On-campus arrest: Miller has caught in a Katy Junior High classroom on Sunday evening with a 14-year-old boy

Suspended: Miller has been placed on administrative leave from her position as a social studies teacher at Katy Junior High

Miller's Facebook page indicates she is a married mother of four.

She has been placed on administrative leave from Katy Junior High pending a full investigation.

A letter explaining the situation went out of parents and staff Monday morning.

Out of hours: Police have not given any further details about exactly what was occurring in Miller's classroom

'The district takes this allegation very seriously and is fully cooperating with prosecutors,' reads the letter.

'The teacher is being charged with a second degree felony for improper relationship between educator and student. The teacher and student were found in the teacherâ€™s portable classroom by a KISD Police Officer patrolling the campus on Sunday evening.'

Parents of students who may have interacted with the social studies teacher on a regular basis are being contacted directly, reports My Fox Houston.

Miller's arrest comes just weeks after another Texas teacher was arrested for inappropriate behavior.

Felicia Smith, 42, allegedly gave a 15-year-old student a four-minute lap dance in front of the entire class.

She has also been placed on administrative leave from Stovall Middle School.

Miller posted $50,000 bond on Monday and has been released.

She is due in court on Tuesday.
