An interview in which Colonel Gaddafi admits funding the election campaign of former president Nicolas Sarkozy will be broadcast across France today.

It is expected to signal a massive crisis for Mr Sarkozy and his third wife Carla Bruni, who are already desperately trying to stave off a range of corruption investigations.

The Gaddafi footage, shot in March 2011, shows the former Libyan dictator saying: 'Sarkozy is mentally deficient. It's thanks to me that he became president. We gave him the funds that allowed him to win.'

Revelations: In the interview the late Colonel Gaddafi claims to have funded an election campaign for former French president Nicolas Sarkozy, who he refers to as 'mentally deficient'

Sarkozy is accused of accepting millions of pounds in illegal payments from Gaddafi before inviting him on a state visit to the Elysee Palace in 2007.

The pair acted like firm allies and friends before the Arab Spring uprising of early 2011, when Gaddafi's hold on power loosened.

It was then that Sarkozy turned on his former friend - initiating Nato bombing raids on Libya which eventually ended with Gaddafi being killed.

There are even well-sourced claims that Sarkozy personally ordered Gaddafi's killing because of fears that their corrupt dealings would be exposed.

Pouria Amirshahi, a leading Socialist politician in France, described the 'shameful' dealings as being 'akin to prostitution', saying ‘the possibility of corruption is very real.’

In the France 3 TV audio recording, to be broadcast today, Gaddafi said his move to finance Sarkozy was part of his political strategy.

‘For us, as Libyans, if the president of France wins elections thanks to our funds, it is a real advantage,’ Gaddafi told journalist Delphine Minoui.

Gaddafi said Sarkozy personally asked him for financial support when he was still France's Interior Minister.

Gaddafi, who ruled Libya for more than 40 years, was shot and stabbed to death by a baying mob, after the convoy he was travelling in was bombed by the French airforce.

Sarkozy lost the 2012 presidential election to Francois Hollande, and the home he shares with Ms Bruni in Paris was raided by anti-corruption police soon afterwards.

As president he was immune from prosecution, but he is now facing a range of enquires, most centring on the raising of illegal funds.

Despite all this, Sarkozy is convinced he can run for president again in 2017 because of the disastrous job Hollande is doing as he tries to run France.
