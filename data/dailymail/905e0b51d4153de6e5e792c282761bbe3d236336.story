West Bromwich Albion are finding it tougher to acquire suitable full-backs because of the £30million fee Manchester United paid Southampton for Luke Shaw, according to head coach Alan Irvine.

A first-choice right-back is desperately needed, while a second left-back would also appeal but prices have been inflated since Shaw's move to Old Trafford.

Baggies target: Irvine has confirmed an interest in Liverpool defender Andre Wisdom

Aston Villa seem keen to keep Albion target Alan Hutton, who will travel with the squad on the American tour, while a loan move for Liverpool's Andre Wisdom is an option.

Sebastien Pocognoli and Chris Baird - signed for a combined £1m - are the club's only senior full-backs.

Irvine said: 'When you start looking for full-backs now the price has changed as a result of what happened with Luke Shaw.

Everybody is suddenly worth an awful lot more than they were before.

'That makes it more difficult for us. We have a budget we have to try and work within. Clearly every pound we can save on one position we can use on another position.

'We are looking for full-backs. Andre Wisdom is perhaps an option. But nothing has been agreed. He's a Liverpool player and one they rate.'

West Brom also want two strikers - to supplement Victor Anichebe and Saido Berahino - and a wide player.
