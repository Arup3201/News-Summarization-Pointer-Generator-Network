Newcastle have announced the signing of Tonga international prop Taione Vea from London Welsh.

The Auckland-born 26-year-old, who has won six caps for Tonga, will join the Falcons on a two-year deal in time for the 2015-16 season.

Newcastle director of rugby Dean Richards said of the former Wasps and North Harbour front-rower: 'We're pleased to be able to add Taione to the squad for the next season. He's a quality prop who is a great scrummager and equally strong on the loose work too.

'As a Tongan international he brings a powerful and skilled head to our front row, although he's also a very humble guy who I know will fit in well with our squad.'

The 6ft2in 20-stone Vea, who joined London Welsh from Wasps last summer, said: 'I've spoken with Dean about his plans for Newcastle Falcons and his vision on where the club is going and it sounds like something I want to be involved with.

'I'm still learning a lot and want to get more Premiership experience so I'm looking forward to doing that at Newcastle Falcons.'
