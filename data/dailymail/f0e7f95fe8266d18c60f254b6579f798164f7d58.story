The racehorse which saw Mike Tindall branded an 'idiot' by his wife, Zara Phillips, for buying a share in has emerged as a contender for the Grand National.

Monbeg Dude, an eight-year-old gelding, is being primed for next year's Aintree race after Ms Phillips helped improve his jumping technique.

Mr Tindall, a former England rugby player, bought a quarter share in the horse, which initially proved to be a poor fence jumper, for £12,000.

But, according to the Telegraph, the Queen's granddaughter was won around by the horse this year after spending time with him during her pregnancy.

Michael Scudamore, the horse’s trainer, who also owns a quarter share in Monbeg Dude, told the paper Ms Phillips has been ‘very, very useful’ in improving the horse’s jumping ability.

He said it was the owners’ intention, after watching him race at Cheltenham last week, for the horse to run in the Grand National in Aintree next year.

The other co-owners are the rugby players, James Simpson-Daniel and Nicky Robinson.

Mr Scudamore told the Telegraph: ‘I’m not sure what route we’ll take to Aintree. He might have one or two more runs and we’d like to give him a little break at some stage.

'If we have a lighter season with him, hopefully we can go to Aintree with a real dream.’

The horse won the Welsh Grand National at Chepstow in January, winning £50,000 prize money, but will not run in next year’s event.

The owners instead want to concentrate attention towards training Monbeg Dude for the Grand National in April.

Mr Tindall, 35, and Ms Phillips, 32, are expecting their first child early in the New Year.
