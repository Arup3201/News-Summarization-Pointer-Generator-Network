Lavinia Sealy, chairman of Surrey County Council, said she was 'fundamentally opposed' to same-sex marriage and predicted it would have negative consequences for 'families and children'

Tory traditionalists in the Cabinet are preparing to back gay marriage despite continuing anger among the party’s grassroots.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, one of the Government’s most senior Right-wingers, indicated yesterday he will vote in favour of legalising same-sex unions next week, while Baroness Warsi, who has previously expressed concern, also revealed she is to back the reform.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, the standard bearer for the Tory Right, is expected to abstain rather than vote against, and may even back the legislation, according to friends.

Some other Cabinet critics are expected to contrive to miss a Commons debate on gay marriage rather than vote against.

Environment Secretary Owen Paterson is the most implacably opposed member of the Cabinet, according to Number Ten sources. Whips expect around 60 per cent of Conservative MPs to vote in favour of gay marriage, and around 40 per cent – 120 MPs – oppose it in a free vote.

In an indication of the ongoing anger in Tory ranks at the reform, which has been championed by David Cameron, one Conservative council chairman launched a strong attack on the party leadership.

Lavinia Sealy, chairman of Surrey County Council, said she was ‘fundamentally opposed’ to same-sex marriage and predicted it would have negative consequences for ‘families and children’.

Mrs Sealy told Paul Deach from the Surrey Heath Residents Network there were ‘lots of gays in the media’, which meant that ‘if anybody speaks out, you’re rubbished’.

In an interview recorded at an event staffed by the Coalition for Marriage, which is campaigning against the Government’s plans, she added: ‘It is not a question of religion, it is a question of our natural beings.

‘It’s a question of being educated about our whole humanity, the history of humanity. Playing around with that just from the point of view of an equalisation doesn’t make sense for families and for children.’

Mrs Sealy said she was ‘disappointed’ with Education Secretary Michael Gove, who represents a Surrey seat, for pushing the equal marriage legislation.

‘Why the hell should they [pro-gay marriage Conservatives] make up their minds about something? We have been in a particular party for longer than they have, probably before they were born...

‘They’re kids on the block in some ways and it annoys me that they can be so clever about it without talking to everybody. It’s a bit Orwellian. Do we have the right to speak out anymore in this country without being dissed by anybody, without being sneered at by the BBC? There are lots of gays in the media that if anybody speaks out, you’re rubbished.’

The councillor added: ‘I am, by the way, absolutely in favour of equal treatment for gays, both lesbians and gays, and the civil partnership.’

Lady Warsi, who is minister for faith, confirmed she planned to vote in favour of plans to legalise gay marriage as long as churches and other faith groups are properly protected.

A spokesman for Mr Grayling, who caused controversy in the last election campaign when he spoke in favour of bed and breakfast owners who wanted to be able to turn away homosexual guests, said he would also vote in favour.
