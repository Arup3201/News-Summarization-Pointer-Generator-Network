Launch: The Duchess of Cambridge with Captain Tony Draper in Southampton this June during the ceremony where she named Princess Cruises' newest ship, Royal Princess

A cruise ship launched by the Duchess of Cambridge only four months ago has been cursed by severe electrical problems during a voyage around the Mediterranean.

Kate named the new vessel ‘Royal Princess’ during a lavish ceremony at Southampton in June when she cut a rope that saw a bottle of champagne being smashed against its hull.

But today the ship cut a sad figure as it limped towards Naples just a week into a twelve day £1,200 cruise carrying more than 3,000 passengers who had originally left from Venice on September 15.

Passengers are expected to stay on the ship until Tuesday night and then disembark on Wednesday morning as arrangements are currently being made for them to be flown home to a variety of destinations.

Today one passenger on the ill-fated cruise told the Daily Mail that problems began on Saturday afternoon when crew members were unable to lift the anchor in at the Greek island of Mykonos.

‘We were stranded there for about four hours until they sorted that out,’ she said.

‘We were told they had eventually repaired and then restarted the motor of the anchor winch.

‘Then on Sunday afternoon the engines just completely stopped which meant many of the lights and lifts did not work for long periods and the air conditioning also failed.

‘I have to add that the crew have been amazing and the restaurant staff have done everything they can to feed people. I think there are some emergency generators on board which have helped.'

Today Princess Cruises who are owned by the United States Carnival Corporation and PLC - but who operate the Royal Princess - confirmed there had been a problem with their vessel and promised passengers a full refund and a 25 per cent discount of any future cruise they wish to book.

The Royal Princess is the world’s sixth largest passenger ship and weighs in at 141,000 tons. The vessel was built in Italy and is 1,083 feet long and 217 feet high. It has 17 decks and a top speed on 22 knots.

Carnival confirmed a ‘power outage’ but said power had been restored to the ship which was on its way to Naples, and added:

‘During the power outrage an emergency back-up generator was used to provide essential services such as toilets. The Captain has been keeping passengers regularly informed about the situation. There are currently 3,594 passengers and 1,336 crew on board.’

The latest problem for the ship comes after Carnival had problems with engine room fires on their vessels Splendor and Triumph which saw both ships having to be towed back to US ports.

In February the Carnival ship Triumph had a fire in the engine room which resulted in a loss of power and propulsion. There were no casualties or injuries to passengers or crew.

That came after an incident in November 2010 when on the second day of a voyage from Long Beach to the Mexican Riviera the cruise liner also suffered an engine room fire which cut all electrical power.

Today one passenger on the Royal Princess posted on a Facebook page: ‘The ship had many other problems in the past eight days - plumbing, electrical, air-conditioning and we were delayed leaving Mykonos for over four hours because they couldn’t get the anchor up.’

Another posted a message on the Princess Cruise Facebook page which read: ‘My friends who are currently on board and texting me are not painting as rosy a picture. They said limited power, major repair work required, ship underway max 10 knots, and just got stuck in an elevator when power failed after the power was restored.’

The problems for the ship come after Carnival boasted how the launch ritual involving the Duchess of Cambridge marked ‘the birth of a vessel, and asks for a blessing of good fortune and safety for the ship and its passengers and crew.’

The company added that the most ‘important element of the naming tradition is the Godmother selected to christen a ship.

‘In the mid-19th century it became customary for a woman of distinction to be selected for this honour. A godmother is the symbolic patron, or sponsor, of the ship through its entire life and symbolizes the spirit of the vessel.’

Previous ‘Godmothers’ for Princess Cruise vessel have included the late Diana Princess of Wales - who named the first Royal Princess in 1984 - along with Audrey Hepburn, Sophia Loren, Margaret Thatcher and Olivia de Havilland.

Today passengers complained about their ordeal on Facebook after their trip was cut short by five days

Following the ship’s maiden voyage to Barcelona on June 16 the Royal Princess had conducted a further nine cruises this Summer and was due to begin visits to the Eastern Caribbean later this year.

This evening a statement from Princess Cruises said: ‘Passengers will be provided with a full refund of their cruise fare, along with a 25 per cent future cruise credit. Princess is making homeward air arrangements for passengers.

‘We have dispatched a care team to Naples to ensure that all our passengers are provided with any assistance they may require.

‘The impact of the repairs on the next Royal Princess cruise, scheduled to depart from Barcelona on September 27, is not yet known and we will keep passengers fully advised as details become known.

Once again, we are deeply sorry for this unanticipated disruption of our passengers’ holiday plans, and we appreciate their patience and understanding of these circumstances.’

Carnival’s Italian subsidiary operated the ill-fated Costa Concordia which ran aground off the island of Giglio in January 2012 and was only winched upright last week.
