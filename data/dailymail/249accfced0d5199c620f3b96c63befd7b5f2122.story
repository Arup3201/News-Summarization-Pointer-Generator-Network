Indiana Pacers star forward Paul George is being sued by a former stripper who claims he is the father of her month-old baby girl.

Daniela Rajic, 24, gave birth to daughter Olivia on May 1, and on Wednesday she filed a paternity suit against George in Manhattan Family Court.

George, 24, and Rajic were reportedly an item for a short time last summer.

Although Rajic now lives in New York, at
 the time the pair met she worked as a stripper at Tootsie’s Cabaret in 
Miami, reports the New York Post.

‘Paul and Daniela saw each other a number of times over the course of a few months in Miami last summer. She became pregnant, and their daughter was born on May 1.

'She has already undertaken a paternity test, and there’s no question he is the father. The court is still expected to order an official DNA test,’ a source told the Post.

George, who is currently focused on trying to defeat NBA champions the Miami Heat, was forced to deny rumors back in February that he had offered Rajic $1million to abort the child.

‘If and when there is legal confirmation that I am the father, I will fully embrace my responsibilities,’ he said in a statement at that time.

How it appears Rajic, who is rumored to have previously been with rapper Lil Wayne, is ready to test George’s resolve.

A rep for George told the Post: ‘As Paul has said all along, if and when the legal process confirms that the baby is his, he will fully embrace his responsibilities as a father and provide emotional and financial support to the child. ‎

'The process has been amicable and we hope it will continue to be until this issue is clarified.’

George scored 31 of his 37 points and almost single-handedly kept the Indiana Pacers alive in the Eastern Conference finals with a 93-90 victory over the Miami Heat on Wednesday

The issue didn’t seem to weigh on George’s mind on Wednesday night, when he scored 31 of his 37 points and almost single-handedly kept the Indiana Pacers alive in the Eastern Conference finals with a 93-90 victory over the Miami Heat.

The Pacers still trail 3-2 in the best-of-seven series. Game 6 will be played Friday night in Miami.

'It's going to be a totally different ball game (in Miami),' George said. 'But we have to rise to the challenge. It will be a fun matchup.'
