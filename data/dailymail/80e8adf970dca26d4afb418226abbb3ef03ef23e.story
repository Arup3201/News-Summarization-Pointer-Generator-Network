A murder trial began on Tuesday of a man accused of brutally sexually assaulting and strangling his girlfriend's four-month-old baby girl.

Jordan Lafayette Prince, 26, has been charged with first-degree murder, abuse of a child and forcible sodomy in St Charles, Missouri for the sickening assaults.

During the December 2012 assault, Ashlynn Lillith Peters was beaten and strangled, apparently to quiet her crying. 

The child's mother, Jessica Lynn Howell, 27, was sentenced to 25 years in prison in January for encouraging Prince to sexually assault her four-month-old daughter in an attack that later killed the child.

Howell, of O'Fallon, was sentenced after pleading guilty Friday to felony abuse of a child and felony murder in January.   

Court documents said she sent a series of text messages to her boyfriend - when Ashlynn was just one month old - encouraging him to have sexual contact with her daughter. 

Howell knew that Prince had sexually assaulted a child in Idaho, according to STLToday.com. The accused killer was not the child's father. 

The mother reportedly sent a text to Prince which read 'no man loves a girl as much as her father', adding that it would be 'hot' if he had sex with her baby, STL Today reported.

The baby's cause of death was ruled as asphyxiation. The prosecution said that the sexual assault, which was carried out with an unknown object, had caused such serious internal bleeding that she would have died without being strangled. 

The baby also had bruises all over her body. 

In his opening statement on Tuesday, Assistant Prosecutor Phil Groenweghe described the last moments of the baby's life as 'sheer hell'. 

The child was rushed to hospital on the morning of her death, with doctors making multiple attempts to save her life. During this time, the couple could not be found and had to be called on their cell phone. 

Prince's attorney claimed he had nothing to do with the crime and noted that investigators found no DNA belonging to Prince that was consistent with their theory.

A roommate, Tony Ruble, testified on the first day of trial that when the couple came home from the hospital, he heard them arguing and trying to get their stories straight. 

On the second day of the trial, the jury was shown a video-taped confession where Prince broke down and told investigators he had strangled the child. 

He claimed he made have been rougher with the baby than intended while he was burping her.  

The accused killer told detectives that he had been sexually abused as a child.  

The trial continues.
