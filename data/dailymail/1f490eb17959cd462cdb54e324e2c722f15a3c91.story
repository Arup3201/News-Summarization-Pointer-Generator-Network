A man who left two pregnant horses in such bad conditions they had to lick moisture off a concrete wall to survive has been jailed.

Mandro Jones, 24, was arrested after the two bay cob mares were found in 'appalling' conditions by vets in February.

The animals, named Marilyn and Baby, were found at a barn in Diss, Norfolk, surrounded by rubbish and broken glass.

Skeletal: Marilyn when she was found in February. The horse and another mare were forced to lick moisture off a concrete wall to survive. Former owner Mandro Jones, 24, was jailed for eight weeks

Baby, pictured as she was rescued, survived her ordeal but her foal did not live through birth

They were so thirsty the horses were found licking moisture off the wall in a bid to survive.

Staff at the nearby Redwings Horse Sanctuary took the pair in and attempted to nurse them back to full health.

But tragically Marilyn was so badly emaciated she had to be put down after giving birth to her foal Norma Jean.

Baby lived through the ordeal but unfortunately her foal failed to survive the birth.

Recovery: Baby after receiving expert treatment. Jones was also banned from keeping horses for ten years

Jones, from Diss, was jailed for eight weeks by magistrates in Norwich after admitting a string of animal cruelty charges.

He was also banned from keeping horses for ten years.

Vet Roxane Kirton said: 'The lack of regard for providing even the horses' basic needs, including food and water, was heart-breaking.

'They were desperately thirsty and so hungry.

'We are delighted that justice has been done for these poor horses, and thank you to the RSPCA and Norfolk police for all their hard work in this case.'

RSPCA Inspector Jason Finch said: 'I am very pleased that this strong sentence sends out a clear message that this kind of extreme neglect will not be tolerated by the courts.'
