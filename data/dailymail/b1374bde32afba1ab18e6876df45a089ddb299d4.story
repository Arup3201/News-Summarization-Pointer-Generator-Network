Mario Balotelli is set for a sensational £16million move to Liverpool, returning to the Premier League after an explosive spell at Manchester City. We asked David Tyrer of Kopite-tinted website Live4Liverpool to explain why he wants the madcap striker at Anfield. 

A few weeks ago, Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers spoke quite plainly when asked about the possibility of signing Mario Balotelli, saying 'He is a wonderful player, but an AC Milan player, I just gave my opinion of him, but doesn’t mean I will be signing him.' 

This, of course, followed some pretty pointed praise for the Milan player but Brendan could not have made his intentions any more clear.

How things can move so quickly though. As of Thursday morning there are reports that Balotelli's agent is on the way to England for talks with the club after a fee was agreed. All this in barely 24 hours.

As for Balotelli himself, it's a tough one to fully make a decision on. He's a superb player with unlimited potential and still only 24. For a striker of his ability, record and potential the £16million fee is a snip.

But even the most ardent fan would have to admit that there is a very tangible reason why Liverpool would become his fifth professional club of his career - he's often more trouble than he's worth. How else would Italy's No 1, top-class striker be available for less than £20million?

From setting off fireworks in his home to training ground fracas, nothing is ever straightforward with Balotelli. 

One minute he's taking the opposition by storm, the next he's getting sent off. In many ways, Liverpool fans can see parallels between Luis Suarez and Balotelli and depending on how you feel about him that is either a bad thing or enough of a reason to buy him.

Personally, I'm torn. On the one hand, he is a star of near endless potential with personal issues, in much the way Suarez was when we signed him. At the time, many had similar reservations, considering he had not long entered a ban for his first biting incident.

On the other hand, Brendan Rodgers has fostered a very unique dressing room atmosphere at Liverpool. One which, only just last season, bore its first fruit when the club challenged for its first title in years. 

If Rodgers can't get a handle on Balotelli from day one, he could very well cause the club to implode. You also have to consider how young the Liverpool squad is, how many personalities there are that a player like Mario could potentially influence. But does this necessarily have to be a bad thing? Of course not.

While I'm torn, there's no denying he's a more attractive option than Samuel Eto'o or Wilfried Bony, both as a player and financially. And while my head says Radamel Falcao is a better option, he is also 28 and for the reported loan fee of £10million for 12 months we could almost fund a permanent move for Balotelli.

Perhaps we could take a leaf out of Barca's book and add a clause similar to their reported (although farcical, if true) 'no more biting' clause?

Regardless, most Reds seem delirious at the thought and, I admit, as the rumours grow I'm becoming more enamoured of the idea, particularly as he'd still represent a top striker and more importantly a signal of intent.
