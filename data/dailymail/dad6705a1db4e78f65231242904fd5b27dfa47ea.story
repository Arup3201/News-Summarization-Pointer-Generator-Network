A beautiful hairdresser has won a two-week honeymoon in Greece after she and her slightly less picturesque fiance won a competition to find the most unlikely couple.

Hairdresser Kate Cathcart, 24, and sales adviser Darren Donaghey, 29, from Newcastle, took first prize in a local radio's Punching Above Your Weight competition after listeners voted them the most mismatched in the looks department.

Miss Cathcart was described by Metro Radio's Steve Furnell as: 'A beautiful blonde with gorgeous teeth, lovely smile, great eyes and a fantastic figure'.

Meanwhile, she described her beau as 'No Tom Cruise', adding: 'We can always edit the wedding photos.'

Perfectly suited: Kate Cathcart, 24, and Darren Donaghey, 29, were voted most unlikely-looking couple

The couple, who have been together for eight years and have a two-year-old son, Jaxon, admit they regularly receive surprised looks when they are out together.

But despite being in different leagues aesthetically, they are adamant that they are perfectly suited.

Mr Donaghey entered the competition, uploading a picture of the pair of them to the radio's website, after hearing about the competition while driving to work.

He said: 'Before even asking Kate, I'd uploaded a photo of us together.

'For years I've had stick about how I managed to woo Kate and it's not unusual to be out together and other guys to innocently start chatting Kate up, thinking that I couldn't possibly be with her.

'Even when we are out shopping at Asda I get these funny looks from blokes and I know what they are thinking.  Having put up with this for years I knew we had a decent chance of winning.'

He added: 'Some of the other blokes in the final were pretty horrid, so at least now I know how I measure up.'

Happy family: The Newcastle couple, who are getting married in August, have a two-year-old son, Jaxon

The couple have been together for eight years and Mr Donaghey says he's used to getting odd looks from men

The couple met when Miss Cathcart moved into Mr Donaghey's Newcastle street. 

He was describing his attractive new neighbour to a friend in the pub, and the friend said: 'That's my sister.'

When
 asked what attracted her to Mr Donaghey, Miss Cathcart said: 'I don't 
know, really, but I did think there was something there, otherwise I 
probably wouldn't have gone there.'

She said: 'I mistook him for his cousin when I first met him so I felt a bit bad and thought I’d better give him a chance.

'We’re still here eight years later, even if he does look a bit like Rodney off Only Fools and Horses.

The couple met after Miss Cathcart moved into Mr Donaghey's street and he set about trying to meet her

'I love Darren dearly and looks aren't everything.  He may not be Tom Cruise, but looks fade, and personality stays for ever.'

Meanwhile her boyfriend is under no illusions.

He said that while she had no bad habits he could think of, 'She’s like one of the boys. 

'She burps and trumpets all the time.  She’s got no decorum, as her mam would say, but that’s what I love about her: '

The pair are getting married this August at Matfen Hall in Northumberland, and will now use their holiday prize as their honeymoon.
