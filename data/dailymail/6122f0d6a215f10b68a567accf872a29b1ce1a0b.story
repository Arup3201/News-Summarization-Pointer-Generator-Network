Love: Raoul dwarfs his tiny guinea fowl friend Pengu but the pair are said to be inseparable

While Christmas may not be the happiest time of year for thousands of turkeys, one affectionate bird won't be featuring on the festive dining table - after striking up an unlikely friendship with a guinea fowl.

The 44lbs turkey, called Raoul, has become inseparable from orphaned Pengu after they were born just days apart.

Both birds were incubated by the same protective mother turkey after a guinea fowl laid an egg in her nest at Feufield Farm, in Symington, South Lanarkshire.

The pair were raised and, despite their considerable size difference, have become best friends ever since.

Farm owner Kim Adam, 54, said: 'We saved Raoul's mother Lola from the pot a couple of years ago and she has lived here ever since.

'They really are best friends. They even refuse to sleep apart.

'I don't think Pengu knows she's a guinea fowl because she won't go near the other birds that we have. She just stays by Raoul's side.'

It was really love through the fence, it's extraordinary as guinea fowl like to wander and go where the mood takes them, but she's always at Raoul's side.

'To the average person, turkeys are quite ugly but they're actually very affectionate creatures.

'When people come to visit they jokingly ask "Is he for Christmas or Thanksgiving dinner?" but I tell them to wash their mouth out.

'Last Christmas, I tweeted as Raoul 
saying that I was safe and sitting with my lady friend and I think I put
one or two people off their Christmas dinner.

'Raoul has a sense of humour and a lovely nature. He also can't resist a flirt with the other animals.'

Kim rescued Raoul's parents Lola and Guissepe from a state of neglect on a turkey farm over two years ago.

Raoul was born soon after, followed by best friend Pengu a few days later.

Inseparable: The pair of feathered friends spend all their time together and even bed down in the same hut

Raoul often uses his considerable size advantage to protect his feathered friend and the pair never fight, said Kim.

She added: 'They could teach us humans a thing or two.

'It certainly is an unusual friendship and they are very popular among visitors to the farm.

'They
have grown up together and even now at the end of the day Raoul sits 
outside and waits for us to put him into the same hut as Pengu.

'He won't sleep anywhere else. They are the best of friends.'

The
five-acre farm, which has been open for five years, became a charitable
trust just over a year ago and employs people with disabilities and 
learning difficulties to help care for the animals.
