Owners of iconic beach huts in Whitby say their view over the beach and sea has been ruined by 'ugly' safety railings.

The crowd control-type barriers went up earlier this month in front of the colourful beach huts on the promenade above West Cliff Beach in the popular North Yorkshire resort.

They were put up by Scarborough Borough Council who cited 'safety concerns', and said the barriers would be replaced with permanent railings in the autumn.

Blighted: The colourful beach huts now have crowd-control barriers to stop people falling off the promenade

But chalet-owners say they were installed without consultation - and are spoiling their beautiful view.

Maggie Hall, whose family has used one of the colourful chalets for 65 years, said: 'One of my great pleasures, one shared by many chalet users, is to hole up in the chalet on a miserable, rainy day with a cuppa, a book and the papers, gazing at that wonderful sight of the beach and the tide.

'I know there are many things to worry about in this world but it breaks my heart to think the council has robbed us of that view and pleasure.'

Artist Dave Jeffery, who regularly paints the view, said: 'It's changed the whole aspect.  For anyone who has a beach hut, sitting out on a deck chair all they will see are metal railings in front of them instead of the view they will have been used to for many, many decades.

'It was a beautiful view, but now the railings look like crowd barriers.  They are very ugly.'

The council said the tide and weather had reduced the level of sand on the beach in recent years, increasing the height of the drop between the promenade and the beach.

Before the railings were put up, users of the promenade managed to get along it without falling into the sea

The council says it plans to replace the temporary barriers with more permanent railings

Andy Skelton, Scarborough Borough Council's director of service delivery, said: 'We were keen to address chalet users' safety concerns and took action to install temporary railings ahead of the last bank holiday weekend, which is viewed by many as the start of the summer season.

'We plan to replace the temporary railings with permanent ones in keeping with the railings used along other parts of the promenade.'
