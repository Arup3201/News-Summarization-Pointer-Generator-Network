UEFA has confirmed disciplinary proceedings have been opened against Partizan Belgrade over the anti-Semitic banner displayed by their fans during the Europa League tie against Tottenham on Thursday night.

The news came after the Serbian club moved to distance themselves from those supporters, issuing an apology and branding the incident a 'mindless act'.

A number of the club's supporters unfurled the sign during the opening group game based on the Only Fools and Horses logo, with the words changed to 'Only Jews and Pussies'.

The 'Only Jews and Pussies' banner was an allusion to the comedy show Only Fools and Horses

The apology, released through Partizan's official website, went on to say that the club will endeavour to ban those found guilty of displaying the banner.

'Dear football aficionados in Serbia and Europe,' it read.

'The football match between Partizan and Tottenham was eagerly awaited in our city and we watched fine performances from both teams in a fair-play sporting atmosphere.

'But this game was marred by malicious act of certain individuals who made all the efforts from our players and our club to prove we deserve our spot in football Europe worthless.

'FC Partizan resolutely disavows with anti-Semitic banner displayed yesterday. The message displayed on that banner is completely opposite to preferences and opinions of almost all citizens of Serbia and Partizan fans.

'It is absolutely absurd to link a club that was founded after the WWII on anti-fascist principles and after the battle of people of Europe with anti-Semitism and similar dark and anti-civilisation impulses.

'We fully condemn perpetrators of this mindless act, not only of anti-Semitic nature, but one that represents hatred of Partizan and Serbia as well.

'We believe this vicious action will not spoil our sporting friendship with Tottenham and football aficionados in Great Britain. In cooperation with competent authorities, Partizan FC will do everything to locate, trial and ban those perpetrators from sporting fields.

'We apologise to everyone who found themselves insulted and upset by this banner. Once again, we point out that such a banner message is completely opposite to history and tradition of our club, and our fans' aspirations.' 

Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino condemned the anti-Semitic banner

Delegates from European football’s governing body were made aware of the banner before half-time, yet no effort was made to take it down.

But UEFA are now investigating the incident, confirming on Friday afternoon that it will address the matter at the start of next month.  

'Disciplinary proceedings have been opened against FK Partizan for racist behaviour of their supporters, field invasions by supporters, setting-off of fireworks and use of laser pointer.

'The case will be dealt by the UEFA control, ethics and disciplinary body on October 3.'

Anti-discrimination body Kick It Out, meanwhile, has urged UEFA to send a clear message to clubs around Europe after the incident.

Kick It Out said it had been made aware of the unsavoury scenes via a ‘large number’ of Spurs fans on Twitter and confirmed it had informed Football Against Racism in Europe (FARE).

FARE said it has made an official complaint to UEFA, who is officially awaiting the match delegate’s report.

‘These incidents seem to be happening in particular countries and in certain parts of Europe where they don’t take them as seriously as we do on our shores,’ Kick It Out’s media and communications manager Richard Bates said. 

‘Incidents aren’t dealt with in the appropriate manner within those countries - if they don’t take a firm stance and they’re allowed to slide, the reality is it will continue to happen.

‘We need UEFA to take a lead, which they have done more over the last couple of years, and demonstrate clearly that these sorts of incidents are completely unacceptable.’

Bates added: ‘It’s always disappointing when any incident like this occurs. ‘It’s disheartening, it’s not acceptable in any way and, after a thorough investigation, it needs to be dealt with in the appropriate manner.’ 

Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino branded the banner as ‘unacceptable’ and ‘disrespectful’.

He said: ‘I didn’t see (it) but the club is aware. It is very disrespectful. It is a shame as it was a great atmosphere. It is very disrespectful, unacceptable and a massive problem for us.’

If Partizan are found guilty they could have part of their ground shut for European competition. 

They were kicked out of this competition when it was the UEFA Cup in 2007 after crowd trouble marred their first qualifying round tie at Bosnia’s Zrinjski Mostar.
