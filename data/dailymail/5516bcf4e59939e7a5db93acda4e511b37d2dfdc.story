Christine Lagarde also criticised Greek citizens 'who are trying to escape tax,' and said the country needs to make more of an effort

The managing director of the International Monetary Fund says she has more sympathy for poor African children than Greeks suffering under the country's economic problems and austerity measures.

Asked whether she worried about the economic and social impact of austerity in the Mediterranean country, Christine Lagarde told the Guardian: 'No, I think more of the little kids from a school in a little village in Niger who get teaching two hours a day, sharing one chair for three of them, and who are very keen to get an education.

'I have them in my mind all the time. Because I think they need even more help than the people in Athens.'

Her comments come as the IMF increases the pressure on the Eurozone nation and makes it clear it will not be softening the terms of the nation's austerity package that is deeply unpopular with the country's electorate.

Lagarde also criticised Greek citizens 'who are trying to escape tax,' and said the country needs to club together to make more of an effort to solve its economic problems.

Greece's tax revenues are currently down by a third in a year and it has been ordered to improve this to help ease the debt.

At the moment, its economy is being kept afloat on international loans provided by the European Union and the IMF, along with the harsh austerity package.

As part of the loan deal it has been ordered to cut everything from wages to public spending to  try and get and get the finances back on track.

Lagarde agreed in the interview that in essence that it is 'payback time' for the country.

The government that agreed to the loan and austerity package was voted out of office in May. 

The new parties, who mainly campaigned on anti-austerity platforms, have not been able to form a government and new elections are scheduled for June 17.

This could speed up the nation's exit from the currency club should a government intent on ripping up the country's bailout programme result, destabilising world markets.

Yesterday, Belgium's foreign minister said central banks and companies risk making a grave error if they do not brace themselves for a possible Greek exit from the eurozone.

Greece accounts for little more than two per cent of the euro zone economy but could pose a profound contagion threat if it quit the currency area, throwing the spotlight on Portugal, Spain and even Italy.

'There is no organised discussion at the European level along the lines of: what do we do (if Greece leaves),' Didier Reynders, who is both Belgium's foreign minister and deputy prime minister, told the European American Press Club in Paris.

'Now, if central banks and companies are not preparing for the scenario, that would be a grave professional error.'   

Spain is in plenty of trouble even disregarding any backwash from Greece.    

Its wealthiest autonomous region, Catalonia, yesterday said it needed help from the central government because it was running out of options for refinancing debt this year.     

Spain's trump card had been that it had successfully issued well over half the sovereign debt it needs to in 2012.    

Civil disorder: As well as the targeting of homes, there has also been violence on the streets of Greece in recent months over the austerity package the previous government signed up to

But after revealing this week that its highly indebted regions faced 36 billion euros of debt refinancing bills this year, way above the previously stated 8 billion, that advantage may have been wiped out.   

On top of public debt, the country is hobbled by a banking sector overwhelmed by bad debts tied to a property market boom that went bust and still has some way further to fall.   

Bankia SA, Spain's fourth-biggest bank, on Friday asked for a bailout of 19 billion euros ($24 billion) to repair losses from a property crash - the biggest Spanish bank rescue ever.    

Spain is nationalising Bankia, which holds some 10 percent of the country's bank deposits. The government insists the bank is a one-off case, but economists say a wider bailout of the sector, either by Madrid or the euro zone, may become necessary.   

Adding to a miserable day for Spanish investors, Standard & Poor's lowered its ratings on the debt of Bankia and four other Spanish banks and said it was taking a dimmer view of Spain's economy.    

Markets have been buffeted by the escalating euro zone crisis in recent weeks and face more uncertainty up to the Greek election date, and maybe beyond.   

The euro plumbed near two-year lows against the U.S. dollar on the back of the Catalonian warning, stocks slipped, and Italian and Spanish borrowing costs rose.   

'The Catalonia news was a big deal because it implies that the Spanish government may have to take on more debt and it cannot afford to do so,' said Richard Franulovich, senior currency strategist at Westpac Securities in New York.
