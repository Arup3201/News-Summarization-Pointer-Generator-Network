It is considerably more expensive than your average 99 ice cream … but it could leave you fizzing with delight.

The world’s first champagne ice lolly has gone on sale in Britain.

Priced at a not-so-cool £5 each, the push-up lolly, called Pops Classic, contains 37 per cent champagne and has only 100 calories.

Bubble up: The world's first Champagne ice lollies, which have gone on sale at £5 a pop...

The luxurious treat is said to already be a hit with celebrities such as Kate Moss and Miley Cyrus and is being sold at events and festivals around the UK.

The lolly’s makers will also deliver boxes of 24 – yours for a mere £100 – and they are in talks with Selfridges to stock it in department stores.

Each lolly contains approximately half a unit of alcohol – the equivalent to around half a glass of champagne. Old school friends James Rae and Harry Clarke created Pops after coming up with the idea on holiday last summer.

Mr Clarke said: ‘We were in Majorca and we were attending a lot of the day parties. We spotted a gap in the market for an alcoholic product that was more refreshing than a drink and could keep you cool.’

And you may need something to help you beat the heat this week as parts of the South-East are forecast to be as warm as the South of France. London is expected to hit 27C (81F), while in other areas of the South and in the Midlands the mercury is set to peak in the mid-20s.

For today, though, an umbrella may be more useful than an ice lolly as heavy rain is forecast.

The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for the South-East, which is predicted to experience heavy downpours today. This rain front should disperse by this evening.
