Losing weight ahead of the big day has become a classic part of being a bride with 96 per cent of women admitting to going on a diet ahead of their wedding.

But for Rachel Chew, 38, from the West Midlands, her bid to lose weight before her big day left her in agony after a bungling surgeon cut through her bowel during gastric bypass surgery.

Three years and seven operations later, the open wound on her stomach has still not healed and Ms Chew remains unmarried.

Upsetting: Rachel Chew had to postpone her wedding after a bungled gastric bypass left her in agony

Damage: Rachel's stomach still has a gaping wound and oozes revolting fluids

'I just wanted to be healthy so that we could enjoy our lives together,' says Ms Chew of the decision that led to the disastrous operation.

'[Fiance Michael] said he would support me in whatever I wanted to do. I thought this is the turning point, this is the start of my new life.'

With three months to go before her wedding to her fiance Michael, she paid Â£7,000 for a private gastric bypass operation in a bid to slim down.

But it only took 24 hours before she began to feel unwell. 'They found that during the first operation, the surgeon had accidentally cut my bowel,' she remembers.

Although the hospital wheeled her straight back into the operating theatre to fix the damage, less than two weeks later, she had to be rushed to A&E after her stitches split, leaving her with a deep hole that oozed infection.

'Three years down the line, and I've had eight operations in total - seven to repair the damage from the initial cut,' she reveals.

During her last operation, surgeons connected her stomach to an external drain to draw off the pus from the continuing infection.

'The pipe is attached to a drain which 
goes into my stomach and the fluid from the wound is sucked out and goes
 into the machine,' she explains.

'I have to carry it everywhere with me, I have to 
shower with it, sleep with it... Everything gets done with this machine.'

The infection and resulting hole have also damaged her relationship with Ms Chew saying that any form of physical contact - even a simple hug - leaves her in pain.

'I don't like him [Michael] touching my stomach at 
all,' she explains. 'It's awful for him because he just wants to give me a hug.

'I 
wish I could allow him to give me the hugs and the closeness I so 
desperately want but I feel so uncomfortable.'

In spite of her injury, Ms Chew and her fiance have now set a new date for the wedding and she hopes a solution to her stomach will be found before she walks down the aisle.

'When I get really down and really low, I keep looking at my dress, thinking "I know this is going to be one of the best days of my life",' she explains.

'Because of the lumps in my stomach and because I'm attached to this machine, I can't actually get in my dress at the moment - it's too tight.

She adds: 'I'm just trying to focus on my future with my fiance and on our wedding.'

Rachel appears on Botched Up Bodies: Brides, Thursday at 10pm on Channel 5
