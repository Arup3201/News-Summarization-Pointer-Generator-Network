Daniel Chisholm was jailed for 12 years for his part in the 'cocaine factory' in Sunderland - but only has to pay £1 of the £750,000 earned

A cocaine dealer who made almost £750,000 from a drugs empire has been ordered to pay back just £1.

Daniel Chisholm was handed a 12-year jail sentence earlier this year after being convicted of conspiracy to supply cocaine.

The gang, which ran a 'cocaine factory' from a Sunderland flat, earned £742,814.

Co-conspirator John Somerville, who was also jailed for 12 years for the same charge, was found to have a £16,094 stake in the business, which he has been ordered to pay back in full.

But Chisholm, who amassed £742,814, only has to pay back £1 because the money is all gone.

Four members of the cocaine gang were given prison sentences totalling more than 34 years in January.

Police were following Somerville in April 2010 when they saw him throw a £12,500 block of cocaine out of the window of his Range Rover in Gateshead.

That day, officers had followed him from his home to Sunderland to pick up Chisholm.

After a short time Chisholm was seen to get out of Somerville's car, which then headed back towards Newcastle out of sight.

When officers finally caught up with Somerville he had no drugs on him.

However, they then found 248g of cocaine on a patch of grass nearby, which he had dumped.

Officers watched on CCTV later that night as a team of men turned up in a minibus looking for the package.

Seven months later police raided Joseph Lewins' flat in nearby Washington and found it had been turned into a drugs factory.

They recovered cocaine worth up to £750,000.

Somerville, 53, Chisholm, 51, and Joseph Lewins, 55, were found guilty of conspiracy to supply cocaine.

Lewins was jailed for nine years.

Ronald Moon, 46, who pleaded guilty to money laundering, was jailed for 15 months.

The case dragged Championship footballer Michael Chopra into the witness box.

Blackpool's Michael Chopra, seen here in a match against Doncaster Rovers on Saturday, was dragged into a trial involving a drugs gang

The striker gave evidence in court claiming a £50,000 bundle found in the footwell of a car was money being used to pay off his gambling debts

The Blackpool striker, who had known Somerville for years, told the court £50,000 of the drugs money linked to him was in fact his gambling debts, which Somerville was helping him pay off.

The court heard Somerville and Daniel Chisholm - who both had previous convictions for drug dealing - were 'central and key players' in the conspiracy.

Jailing them for 12 years he said: 'You were close to the original source, although neither of you were absolutely the top of the tree.'
