Some 3,000 daredevils decked out in white outfits and red scarves dodged bulls at a Georgia horse park to get a taste of the running of the bulls.

Just like its Pamplona, Spain inspiration, the Great Bull Run in Atlanta, Georgia featured many 1,200lb bulls and a lot of beer.

Horse riders herded bulls into a fenced course for the event in Conyers.

Daredevils grabbing life by the horns sprinted alongside the beasts as they made their way around the course.

'I'm not getting any younger, so might as well do it,' bull-runner Vilma Fernandez told WSBTV.

'I'm expecting I'm probably going to wake up in the hospital with two thumbs up,' said another.

Runners had 18 bulls hot on their heels running at 30 miles an hour.

Two thrill-seekers ended up in hospital and several fell or were knocked over, but there were no serious injuries on the day.

Runners paid $75 on the day of the event for the dubious privilege of running with the dangerous beasts.

Festival goers could also participate in the Tomato Royale food fight like the traditional La Tomatina festival held in Valencia, Spain on the last Wednesday of August.

In Pamplona and other places where traditional encierros, or running of the bulls are held, the six bulls in the event are those that will feature in the afternoon bullfight of the same day.

Unlike in Spain, the bulls in the Conyers race do not participate in a bullfight and are not killed after the run.

From Georgia, they're headed off to Houston for another bull running event there in December.

The bull run at Georgia International Horse Park was the second U.S. event this year for the group Great Bull Run.
