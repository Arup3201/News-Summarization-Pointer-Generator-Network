A California Highway Patrol officer videotaped repeatedly punching a woman on the side of a Los Angeles freeway had just pulled her from oncoming traffic, and she resisted by pushing him, a patrol investigator revealed in his report earlier today.

51-year-old Marlene Pinnock had been walking barefoot on eastbound Interstate 10 west of downtown Los Angeles on July 1, when she was tackled to the ground by Officer Daniel Andrew, who then brutally beat her as one passerby filmed the event.

In his report, investigator Sean Taketa outlined the incident in a request to search Mrs. Pinnock's medical records and assess the extent of her injuries.

Attack: Motorist David Diaz filmed a California Highway Patrol officer straddle a Marlene Pinnock while punching her in the head on the Interstate 10 in Los Angeles

Attack: The 51-year-old pushed the officer after he tried to pull her out of traffic, causing the attack according to an investigator

Attack: Several people have claimed they recognize the California Highway Patrol officer in the footage of the July 1 assault because they'd also had run-ins with him

Pinnock has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and had been off her medication for two to three months before the altercation. 

Officer Andrew arrived and told Pinnock she could walk off or have a ride away from the freeway, according to the warrant. 

She walked away without listening to his instructions and moved partially into traffic, so Andrew 'grabbed her arm to prevent her from being struck by traffic. Ms. Pinnock resisted by pushing the officer,' the documents say.

Andrew then straddled her on the ground as Pinnock resisted by 'kicking her legs, grabbing the officer's uniform and twisting her body,' the investigator wrote. 

Andrew 'struck her in the upper torso and head several times with a closed right fist,' the records say.

The victim's family have hired Los Angeles attorney Caree Harper to represent them in the case against the California Highway Patrol.

Harper said her clients want the authorities held accountable for 'beating a great-grandmother in broad daylight.' 

'We want the focus to be what he was doing to her, not what she was doing' prior to the confrontation, said Harper.

'She was getting beat like an animal. No one should ever be beat like that.' 

The California Highway Patrol had vowed to carry out a thorough investigation.

CHP Assistant Chief Chris O'Quinn had said at a news conference soon after the event that the woman was endangering herself and people in traffic, and the officer was forced to restrain her.

O'Quinn added that the Mrs. Pinnock had begun walking off the freeway but returned when the confrontation occurred.

Passing motorist David Diaz recorded the uniformed officer as he jabbed Mrs Pinnock at least 11 times in the head.

'The most animalistic, most brutal way to subdue someone is to pound someone's head into the concrete with really big blows to the head,' Diaz said at the time.

'There was no weapons - it's obviously excess force,' he continued.

'He starts really letting loose... He starts pounding down on her face really hard. He doesn't try to grab her hands first.'

In an interview with the AP, Pinnock said she believed the officer was trying to kill her.

"He grabbed me, he threw me down, he started beating me," she said. "I felt like he was trying to kill me, beat me to death."

Andrew, who is on paid administrative leave, joined the Highway Patrol as a cadet in April 2012 and became an officer six months later.
