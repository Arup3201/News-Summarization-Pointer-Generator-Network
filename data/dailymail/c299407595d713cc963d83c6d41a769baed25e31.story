Siblings will fight over anything and these pictures of squabbling twin bears proves just that.

Walking through the shallows of Alaska's Lake Clark without a care in the world, the three-year-old grizzlies suddenly square up to each other and decide to scrap it out.

The bigger of the two, the brother, looks more confident as he bears down on his sister.

The bears square up to each other and suddenly turn rather predatory

The larger male brown bear starts the fight and his sister can be seen here taking a more defensive position before fighting back

They take up their positions in Lake Clark National Park, Alaska, and prepare to do battle

And they're off. They rear up and go for each other. The bigger of the two bears scores the first point with a clip around the ear

Lake Clark is said to be teeming with their favourite food, meaty razor clams, but even this isn't enough to distract them.

The brother kicks things off 
with a side swipe at his sister who seems at first reluctant to get 
involved.

Within moments they rear up on their hind legs and London photographer Nathan Harrison captures them standing well over six feet.

But just as suddenly as they started, they stopped.

Appearing to call a truce they drop their guards and appear best of friends again.

Lake Clark's website refers to the park as 'a land of stunning beauty
where volcanoes steam, salmon run, bears forage, craggy mountains 
reflect in shimmering turquoise lakes, and local people and culture 
still depend on the land and water of their home.Â 

Sibling rivalry has clearly got too much and the twins fight it out

Standing up the bears reach well over six feet. Here they can be seen locking arms and wrestling each other

The three-year-old juvenile bears are just reaching the age when young bears start to lose patience with each other

A left paw comes up from the bigger bear and slaps down on his sibling

'Solitude is found around every bend in the river and shoulder of a mountain.'

The park is home to thirty-seven species of terrestrial mammals, five
different marine mammal species and over 160 species of birds. Fish 
include salmon, arctic char, arctic grayling, Dolly varden, northern 
pike, lake trout, and rainbow trout.

The brown bear is a large bear distributed across much of northern 
Eurasia and North America. An adult brown bear in Alaska living on a 
steady, nutritious diet of spawning salmon may weigh as much as 680 kg 
(1,500 lb).

The pair are said to be fighting over a meal of razor clams sourced from the shallow waters of the lake

The bears call a truce and put the scrap behind them

The twins are best friends again as the roam the shallow waters of Lake Clark National Park, happy in each others company

And off they go. Photographer Nathan Harrison captures the moment the pair wander off into the park
