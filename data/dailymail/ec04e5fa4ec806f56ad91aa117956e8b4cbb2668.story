British war graves in India are in danger of being dug up to make way for a new metro rail line.

Some of the 2,000 graves in Lucknow, the Uttar Pradesh state capital, could be destroyed as part of plans by the city’s authorities to build a railway line.

The graves are those of British troops who were trapped inside the Lucknow Residency during the uprising of 1857 known as the Indian Mutiny or India's First War of Independence.

The cemeteries, which are protected by the Archaeological Survey of India, have become a site of pilgrimage for descendants of the troops which include some of the most celebrated figures in the British Empire.

Buried there are Major-General Sir Henry Havelock, whose statue stands in Trafalgar Square in London, and Major William Hodson, founder of the Hodson’s Horse irregular cavalry which continues today as the Indian Army's 4th Horse Regiment.

Some descendants, including leading judge Sir Mark Havelock-Allan, have voiced their concern about the construction plans. 

P.K. Mishral, superintendent of the Lucknow branch of the survey, said the graves were historic shrines that must be protected.

He was quoted in the Daily Telegraph saying: We have to protect all these things relevant to our history.’

But city officials are angry at the Archeological Survey of India’s rules which protect the graves as historical monuments, preventing any construction within 330 feet of them.

They claim that the rules should be waived in this case as the graves are not looked after by relatives and are preventing the modernisation of the city.

A Metro project manager, who did not want to be named, said he thought the opposition could be overruled.

He said: ‘There are some difficulties and we are trying to sort them out with concerned officials. 

‘We will take care of everything before taking a final decision.’

The Indian Mutiny was an uprising by local soldiers against the ruling British East India Company.

In 1857, growing tension was inflamed by rumours that Indian soldiers' rifle cartridges were being greased with pig and cow fat, offending Muslims and Hindus alike.

The unrest erupted in May. The city of Delhi soon fell and there were further uprisings elsewhere.

In Lucknow, Chief Commissioner Sir Henry Lawrence fortified his home - the Residency - and prepared for a siege. 

Mutineers attacked the Residency and its 1,700-strong garrison in May and by July Sir Henry was dead.

Garrison numbers dwindled until a relief force under Major-General Sir Henry Havelock fought its way into Lucknow in September.

The Residency was evacuated in November but was recaptured in March the following year and the uprising was crushed soon after.

The East India Company was subsequently abolished and the government of India transferred to the Crown.
