A Queensland woman claims she found a maggot in  chicken aioli wrap on Sunday

A 'big dirty maggot' was the last thing a Queensland woman expected to find while eating a McDonald's chicken aioli wrap on Sunday.

Georgia McDonald, of Gladstone, was two bites into the wrap she bought at the Kin Kora McDonald's when she found what she claims was a maggot.

"It revolted me to the point that I will never eat at any McDonald's restaurant ever again," she told The Queensland Times.

She said finding the surprise 'creature' in the wrap was a gut-turning experience and should never happen.

'This is not only a health concern for myself, but also a health concern for the hundreds of patrons eating at this McDonald's store on this day or days leading up to this incident.'

'I know McDonald's is not the healthiest option on the market, but when I pay for food from anywhere, I expect that the products used will be fresh, and to a quality which the owner would eat,' she said.

McDonald's believes the woman found a fruit grub and not a maggot inside the wrap

Local McDonald's licensee Tony Ward said the fast-food company was disappointed by the incident.

Mr Ward said it was likely Ms McDonald had found a fruit grub rather than a maggot and that the restaurant chain implements strict processes and systems to ensure food quality.Â 

A McDonald's spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia fruit grubs can sometimes be found in fresh produce.

'We take food quality very seriously,' the spokesperson said. 'We have spoken with the customer and will continue to keep her informed.'

The fast-food company said it was disappointed the incident happened and that fruit grubs can sometime be found in fresh produce. Pictured is a stock image
