A man left paralyzed after heroically diving into a creek to save a 4-year-old girl from drowning has received thousands of dollars in support to pay for his medical bills.

Strangers have already pledged $60,000 to help Michael Patterson, 43, who broke his neck in three places while saving the life of 4-year-old Javea Jones from drowning in a northwest Georgian creek, according to the Friends of Mike Patterson Trust. The paralyzed father faced huge medical bills without any insurance, until strangers established the trust to benefit him.

'I did not realize that there was still kindness in this world like there is. I kind of thought the world had grown cold until this happened to my son,' Patterson's mother Vickie Jones Roberson told WSB-TV.

Patterson, of Rockmart, Ga., was visiting the Euharlee Creek with his son on June 8 when a young girl was dragged underwater. Authorities say Jones had been playing in the creek and stepped into a section of deep water.

The girl was dragged under water, her mother Carlisa said, describing it as the worst moment of her life - until the Good Samaritan took action. She described Patterson as a 'hero' and an 'angel'.

In the hospital, Patterson explained his actions.

'I just did what I would hope anybody
else would’ve done for me,' Patterson said to his mother, according to TODAY.

'He has always been like that – someone else first,' Roberson told WSB-TV.

Patterson struck his head during the rescue, breaking his neck in three places and leaving him with a severed spinal cord.

Both Jones' mother and Patterson's nine-year-old son witnessed the horrific moment that his father broke his neck on hitting the water.

He was unconscious in the water for three minutes before being dragged out by bystanders.

EMTs performed CPR before he was taken to the Redmond Regional Medical Center. He is now paralyzed.

Remarkably, it was the second time in two weeks that Patterson had saved someone's life--he also pulled a truck driver to safety when his rig caught on fire.

Roberson said her son recently started a job installing sheet rock and doesn't have health insurance. She told TODAY the family is trying to transfer him to the an Atlanta nonprofit hospital Shepherd Center which specializes in spinal cord rehabilitation.

Tragic: Michael Patterson mumbled to his mom from the hospital that he didn't want to die. 'I want to live,' he said

She told WSB-TV: 'Pray and pray, and have a lot of faith. That's all I can do.'

The Friends of Mike Patterson Trust was established Wednesday to help him and his family by three people who did not know Patterson before the accident.

'We are trying to help his family raise money for this hero,' the trust's GoFundMe page reads.

As of Thursday morning, Patterson was in a medically-induced coma and back on a ventilator, according to the group's Facebook page. On Tuesday he was originally taken off the respirator but after bacteria-filled creek water entered his lungs gave him pneumonia, he got worse Wednesday night, TODAY reported.

He could remain paralyzed from the waist down with some movement in his right arm for the rest of his life.

His mother told TODAY Patterson is still not aware of his paralysis.

'This is his worst nightmare,' she said. 'But he has a heart of gold, and I do know with all my heart that he’s not going to give up.'

Roberson told TODAY his son mumbled from his hospital bed that he wanted to live.

'I don’t want to die, I want to live,' Patterson said.

His mother said she feels blessed, despite what happened.

'I'm blessed. Regardless of everything that has happened and that my heart is broken, I am still blessed. I know that because of all the people who have reached out,' Roberson told WSB-TV.

Thanking her son's supporters, who have come from around the world, Roberson said: 'You are all awesome, every one of you'.

'It's like angels taking care of an angel that they knew needed him,' she said.
