President Barack Obama played down the rocky relationship he and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel have had throughout the Pentagon chief's two-year tenure at a retirement ceremony on Wednesday afternoon.

'In an era of politics that too often descends into spectacle, you’ve always served with decency and dignity. And in a town of outsized egos, you’ve never lost your Midwestern humility,' Obama said of Hagel, a Nebraska native. 

'You’ve always been frank and honest and said what you thought. And I have so profoundly benefited from that candor,' Obama added.

Fondly recalling their time serving in the Senate together and calling outgoing Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel a 'friend,' Obama sought to avoid turning a celebration of the former combat soldier's 30 years of service into a haranguing today

Fondly recalling their time serving in the Senate together and calling Hagel a 'friend,' Obama sought to avoid turning the celebration of the former combat soldier's 30 years of service into a haranguing.

A military man turned politician, Hagel represented Nebraska in the U.S. Senate for two terms before leaving the upper chamber in 2009 to work in academia. Obama plucked him out of retirement from public service in 2013 to serve as one of his top military advisers.

The relationship between the two men of opposing political parties soon soured, however, and less than two years after taking the position, Hagel resigned, reportedly under pressure from the president himself.

Obama said at a ceremony announcing the departure in November that it was Hagel's decision to leave.

But the White House has since maintained that he and Hagel 'arrived together at the determination that new leadership should take over' at the Pentagon.

A senior Pentagon official told NBC News at the time that Hagel was asked to step down because the president no longer had confidence in his ability to lead the military as it struggled to defeat Islamic extremists waging war in the Middle East.

'He wasn’t up to the job,' the official said. 

Obama's spokesman, Josh Earnest, told reporters that wasn't true and that Hagel 'has been the right person for the job, and he has performed to the president's expectations in a way... [that] will contribute to the ongoing effort that has made the US military the most powerful force for good in the world.'

Still, Earnest admitted that the challenges now facing the Pentagon are different that those that were at the forefront when he was nominated for Defense Secretary.

At that time, Earnest said, 'the threat that was posed by ISIL was not nearly as significant as it is now.' 

'The priorities of the department, or at least of the new secretary, have changed given changes in the international community,' he said.

'It doesn't mean that Secretary Hagel hasn't done an excellent job of managing these crises as they have popped up,' Earnest continued, but it does mean 'that another secretary might be better suited to meet those challenges - that was something the two of them agreed.'

Less than two years after being nominated to lead the Pentagon, Hagel resigned in November, reportedly under pressure from the president

Today Earnest's stand-in, Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz, said 'friction' between the White House and the Pentagon is 'something that predates this administration.'

Asked specifically about Hagel's predecessors, Leon Panetta and Robert Gates, both of whom wrote scathing critiques of their time in the Obama administration once they'd exited the president's service, Schultz said the president and his staff 'always deeply value and respect the input of our military leadership.' 

'That's something that is placed at paramount value here at the White House and something that goes into every consideration the President makes as Commander-in-Chief.'

Schultz said the White House believes it has 'good relationships with the military leaders.'

'And most importantly the President has an open ear, and values their input around the table or over the telephone,' he stated. 

The president has nominated former Pentagon official Ash Carter to serve as the next Secretary of Defense. He's expected to undergo a smooth confirmation process. 

Senators on the Armed Services committee will question Carter next week. A vote of the full Senate on his nomination will likely come soon after that, allowing Hagel to finally leave his post more than two months after formally offering the president his resignation.

Hagel said today that he'd 'cherished' leading the Department of Defense, but 'of all the opportunities my life has given me, I am most proud of having once been a soldier'

Despite alleged differences that ultimately cost Hagel his job, Obama had nothing but praise for the 68-year-old veteran at this afternoon's ceremony.

Thanks to Hagel's 'guiding hand,' Obama said today, the Pentagon is 'better positioned for the future.'

His 'greatest impact' perhaps,Obama said, 'a legacy that will be felt for decades to come' is the example he set for the nation's men and women in uniform. 

'It’s not simply that you’ve been the first enlisted combat veteran and the first Vietnam veteran to serve as Secretary of Defense. It’s how your life experience - being down in the mud, feeling the bullets fly overhead - has allowed you to connect with our troops like no other Secretary before you.'

Obama said he's 'grateful to Chuck on a very personal level.'

'Exactly 10 years ago this month, I joined you in the United States Senate, along with the Vice President,' he recalled.

'I was new and green; you were a veteran legislator. I was the student, and you shared some of the lessons of your service. I was young and you were....well,' he trailed off, eliciting laughter from attendees.

Speaking before the president, Gen. Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, heaped on Hagel's 'incredible' and 'remarkable' record of service.

'His resolve is simply as solid as steel,' Dempsey said, 'but his love of his country is even stronger.'

Vice President Joe Biden, another former colleague of Hagel's in the Senate, said the outgoing Defense head has the type of 'integrity' that everyone who has ever served with him in any capacity agrees 'is recognizable immediately.'

Biden, a close friend of Hagel's who reportedly opposed his ousting, said he was 'truly going to personally miss' working with his friend.

'Thank you for all you've done....all you've done for me, all you've done for the country,' Biden said. 'I'm proud to call you a friend' he said, 'and I'm proud to stand by you as a Secretary of Defense about to retire.'

Hagel told Gen. Marting Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, right, 'I have been very fortunate to have you as my partner in this job. especially during those spirited "self-help" and "educational" opportunities called congressional hearings'

After Obama's remarks, Hagel took the stage and thanked Obama for allowing him to serve on his cabinet for the last two years.  

To Dempsey he said, 'I have been very fortunate to have you as my partner in this job.

'Especially during those spirited "self-help" and "educational" opportunities called congressional hearings,' he joked.

He additionally thanked his wife, Lilibet, and replacement Ash Carter, whom he commended for his previous service at the Pentagon and 'for his continued commitment to public service.'

Hagel also set aside a few minutes of his speech to offer his view on international affairs. 

'We must recognize that there is not an immediate answer to every problem', he said that some challenges require the 'patience to seek higher ground' to get the intended results.

The world is not 'moving toward less complicated' challenges, he said, in fact, challenges are becoming more global, and countries need to focus on how to 'solve problems through coalitions of common interests.' 

'With all of the world's trials and problems it is still a hopeful world, this I believe,' he concluded.

Hagel said he'd 'cherished' leading the Department of Defense, but 'of all the opportunities my life has given me, I am most proud of having once been a soldier.

'The lessons from my time in uniform about trust, responsibility, duty, judgment, and loyalty to your fellow soldier...these I have carried with me throughout my life,' he remarked.
