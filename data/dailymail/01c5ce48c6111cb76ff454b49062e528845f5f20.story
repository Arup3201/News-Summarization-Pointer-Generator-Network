The First Lady's trip to China has hit a slight road bump after one of their highly-awaited guests appears to have missed a formal dinner.

The Obamas were expected to meet the highly-reclusive Chinese princess Xi Mingze during a formal dinner on Friday night during their tour of China but she was nowhere to be seen.

Much about Xi Mingze has been kept a secret to Chinese and foreign media but she is believed to be a student at Harvard University now and there were reports that she would travel to her homeland to meet Mrs Obama, her mother and her daughters because Harvard is in the middle of their spring break.

Law enforcement sources originally reported that that Xi Mingze, 22, whose nickname is 'Muzi,' was believed to have returned to China from her off-campus apartment in East Cambridge that she rents under an alias, but she has not been seen since her alleged arrival.

Enthusiastic: Mrs Obama showed some spirit at one point in the performance on Saturday

Xi Mingze – who has never appeared in  public with her parents in China, according to Chinese media reports –  moved to the off-campus apartment this semester, says one law enforcement source who has been briefed on the significant security around s daughter, told MailOnline exclusively.

The 'unassuming' only daughter of Chinese President Xi Jinpingi, who is also the leader of the Communist Party, lived in a Harvard University dorm under a pseudonym while surrounded by a phalanx of 'Chinese students' who are part of her around-the-clock security detail, said the source.

‘She is very-low key and her security detail are here masked as fellow students so they blend in,’ said the law enforcement source.

Harvard classmates describe her as ‘studious and discreet’.

It remained unclear if Princess Xi 
Mingze was part of that tour, but the law enforcement source said police
 were briefed on the Chinese First Daughter’s  whereabouts before spring
 break began Monday.

Muzi’s mother, Peng Liyuan is a  
renowned honey-voiced megastar of popular Chinese folk music known for 
her fashion and glamor, much like her guest, Michelle Obama.

Peng
 guided the First Family through the Forbidden Palace and showed off her
 calligraphy talents with an entourage of admirers and photographers in 
tow.

‘She was expected to return to China to attend a dinner for Michelle Obama,’ the source said.

Friends at Harvard say she devotes 
herself to her courses, which include political studies. She attended a 
discussion last spring about the political tumult convulsing China's 
Communist Party, where she reportedly listened 'intently' from the top 
row of the lecture hall.

Meeting fans: The First Lady met with students at the Stanford University Center at Peking University in Beijing later on Saturday

Avoiding controversy: Mrs Obama has tried to keep the trip apolitical, and when she has spoken out it is in favor of widely-accepted topics like the importance of studying aboad

Xi 
Mingze has maintained a low profile at Harvard University, unlike 
Michelle Obama’s husband President Barack Obama, who graduated from 
Harvard Law School.

Harvard graduate student and PhD 
candidate Jennifer Yum, 30, said she was not surprised that the leader 
of China’s Communist Party would send his only daughter to Harvard.

Yum
 was interviewed at Harvard’s Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies on 
Cambridge Street, which just last September hosted a lecture event 
titled: ‘Xi Jingpin and China’s Future: The Critical Issues’.

‘Harvard is where the powerful come to study. If you are an elite in the world, you study at Harvard,’ said Yum.

Yum,
 like other students interviewed, said that she was aware that Xi 
Mingze’s father has prohibited many of the very elements of free speech 
that are encouraged at Harvard.

‘I
 still don't think it's hypocritical that the President sent his 
daughter here’, Yum said. ‘Maybe she can learn how to be a better 
leader.’

One of the most controversial talking 
points that Mrs Obama addressed was when she spoke to students on 
Saturday came when she touched on freedom of speech.

China blocks many foreign news sites and social media services such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

Its army of censors routinely filters out information deemed offensive by the government and silences dissenting voices.

Though
 not likely to be well-received by the government, Mrs. Obama's remarks 
may not draw any strong protest because her speech and a subsequent 
moderated discussion among 50 students - sitting in two identical 
conference rooms in Beijing and Palo Alto, California, but connected via
 modern technology - focused mainly on the value of educational 
exchanges.

Mrs. Obama 
said the free flow of information is crucial 'because that's how we 
discover truth, that's how we learn what's really happening in our 
communities and our country and our world.'

'And
 that's how we decide which values and ideas we think are best - by 
questioning and debating them vigorously, by listening to all sides of 
every argument and by judging for ourselves,' she said.
