Families have resorted to 'panic buying' houses because of a shortage of properties on the market, estate agents warned today. 

Britain’s housing crisis, which is being fuelled by the lack of homes available to buy, is ‘getting worse’, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said.

It comes as three former Chancellors warned George Osborne's Help to Buy Scheme is at risk of inflating a new housing bubble.

House prices are ballooning as fewer properties come on to the market, coupled with huge demand which has seen estate agents sell an average of 23 properties in the last three months

The number of homes coming on to the market has been falling since the beginning of the year, the first time that four consecutive monthly falls have taken place since 2000.

But the average number of homes sold by an estate agent over the last three months has hit 23, the highest number for six years.

RICS said the cost of buying a home is ballooning because there are too few homes available to buy and too few new ones being built with estate agents warning of ‘panic buying’.

The report, published today, says homebuyers are being crippled by ‘a constrained property market which continues to be marred by weak supply and high demand.’

Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at RICS, said: ‘The critical issue for the market remains the lack of second hand supply.

‘Our numbers suggest that the picture is, if anything, getting worse.’

Its members predict house prices will rise by six per cent every year for the next five years.

The average price of a home in the UK is currently £183,600, according to the Nationwide. If it rises by six per cent a year, it will be around £240,000 in five years’ time.

Mr Rubinsohn added: ‘Clearly, the absence of properties to buy will ultimately be a factor in influencing the ability of people to move homes.’

Experts warn that the property boom is not just taking place in London (pictured) but could spread across the country, with prices set to rise in the North West and East Anglia

Former Tory Chancellor Lord Lawson warned demand is rising faster than the supply of new homes can be increased

Three ex-Chancellors have warned George Osborne his flagship mortgage scheme risks inflating a new housing bubble.

Labour's Alistair Darling and Tories Norman Lamont and Nigel Lawson said the Help to Buy scheme, guaranteeing loans for people with small deposits, could backfire.

It follows a warning from the OECD economic think tank this week that new rules were needed to limit the size of mortgages.

Lord Lamont, chancellor under John Major, told the Financial Times: 'What will happen is that demand can be increased quickly, through measures like Help to Buy, but supply can only be increased slowly.

'My concern is that it will become even harder for young people to buy a home in the future.'

Mr Darling said: 'We keep repeating the same mistakes,” he said. “Supply of housing is the biggest single thing. Unless supply can be increased substantially, we will exacerbate that situation with schemes like Help to Buy.' 

Lord Lawson suggestedthe scheme should be limited to properties worth £300,000, instead of £600,000.

A Treasury spokesman said: 'We’re dealing with a very specific issue in addressing a market failure after the financial crisis, which has been about affordability and availability of mortgages.” 

RICS, which conducts a monthly investigation of the housing market, said it is not just London, but the whole the country, where house prices are rising.

There is ‘a broadening out in the recovery away from the capital', it said, and singled out the North West and East Anglia as two regions where house prices are expected to rise.

Estate agents warn of the problem that they are facing due to the huge demand from buyers, but the lack of people prepared to sell their home.

One agent from Portsmouth, said: ‘Major lack of supply is causing panic buying in two and three bedroom house market at present.’

One agent, from Norwich, said: ‘Lack of supply continues to restrict the market.’

Another agent, also from Portsmouth, said: ‘A shortage of instructions is affecting the market. Prices are inflated due to lack of choice.’

An agent, from Pimlico, London, said: ‘Prices continue to increase but stock levels are still depleted.

‘Some astonishing asking prices are being quoted on occasion, just because they can. This is unhelpful.’

The RICS report comes after the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the respected think-tank, raised its fears about Britain’s housing market over-heating.

Last week, Sir Jon Cunliffe, one of the Bank of England’s two deputy governors, said he is not aware of any other country, except Australia, which even has a word for ‘gazumping.’

This is when a seller accepts one offer but later decides to turn it down in favour of a higher offer from a rival bidder.

He said: ‘There will always be a number of blinking warning lights - risks generated at home and risks coming from abroad - on our dashboard.

'The growing momentum in the [housing] market is now in my view the brightest light on that dashboard.’

Sir Jon said it is the strength of the housing market, rather than the weather, which is actually ‘the dominant topic of conversation in the UK.’

Official figures, from the Office for National Statistics, show the average home in London ‘earned’ more than its owner over the last year after prices rose by nearly 18 per cent.

A typical worker in the capital with a full-time job earns a salary of £35,250 before tax, but their home, also in the capital, ‘earned’ a tax-free £63,000 over the same 12 month period.
