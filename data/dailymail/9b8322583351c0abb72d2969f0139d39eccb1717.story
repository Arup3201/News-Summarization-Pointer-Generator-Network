They are all icons of the Stretford End, adored for their wonderful goals, committed performances and all-round class.

And now, Manchester United's famous No 7s past and present have been immortalised as unique works of art.

George Best, Bryan Robson, Eric Cantona, David Beckham, Cristiano Ronaldo and Angel di Maria have all been depicted in stylish prints commissioned by the Bleacher Report.

George Best, the original Manchester United No 7, is shown in his sixties pomp on this artwork

Best, the original No 7 poster boy who helped United to glory both at home and in Europe, is shown by artist Zoran Lucic in his sixties pomp, his name presented boldly to reflect the impact he had both on the pitch and off it as football's first celebrity.

The Northern Irishman guided United to the First Division championship in 1965 and 1967, though his crowning glory undoubtedly came when United beat Benfica 4-1 at Wembley to lift the European Cup in 1968.

Voted the world's best footballer in that same year, Best continues to be regarded by those fortunate enough to see him as one of the finest players ever.

Brendan Higgins channels the esteem in which 'Captain Marvel' Robson was held by United's fans in his artwork.

He shows Robson carried shoulder high by the fans who stormed the Old Trafford pitch following United's famous 3-0 win over Barcelona in the European Cup-Winners' Cup in 1984.

The former England captain made a total of 461 appearances for the club, helping them to two Premier League titles, three FA Cups, the League Cup and the Cup-Winners' Cup in 1991.

'King' Cantona was rarely out of the headlines and that is celebrated by artist Richard Debenham, who has mocked up a newspaper front page for his tribute.

A flawed genius, Frenchman Cantona inspired United to four Premier League titles in the Nineties as well as two FA Cup wins in 1994 and 1996, scoring in both finals.

Voted the club's greatest-ever player in a survey by Inside United magazine, few who saw him at his best would argue.

Eric Cantona was rarely out of the headlines and that is celebrated in this artwork

Beckham is shown by Steve Welsh in a familiar pose - carrying a trophy. In this case, it's the FA Cup in 1999, the second leg of United's unprecedented Treble triumph.

One of the best midfield players and free-kick takers ever, Beckham enjoyed a glittering career at Old Trafford, winning six league titles, two FA Cups and the Champions League in 1999.

In all, he scored 85 times in 394 matches for United and also captained England, winning 115 caps in total for his country.

Dan Leydon shows Cristiano Ronaldo's cheeky grin, no doubt after bamboozling another opponent.

Undoubtedly the best player in the world now, Ronaldo's career really took at United, where he won three Premier League crowns, the FA Cup, two League Cups and the Champions League in 2008.

The Portuguese scored 118 goals in 292 matches for the club and is still celebrated with 'Viva Ronaldo' chants at Old Trafford now.

Brining the No 7 collection bang up to date is Sebastian Domenech, who shows the latest player to continue the tradition - Di Maria.

The Argentina superstar is shown performing his familiar heart celebration as he marks one of his early goals for the club.

Brought in by Louis van Gaal for a British record £60m in the summmer, Di Maria certainly has all those match-winning qualities expected of a United No 7.

And linking past with present is Charis Tsevis, who brings all six portraits together in one - very red - montage.

Angel di Maria celebrates his magnificent goal at Leicester earlier in the season
