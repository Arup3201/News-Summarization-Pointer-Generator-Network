Nottingham Forest have signed former Sunderland centre-back Louis Laing.

The 21-year-old had been training with Blackburn and was offered a surprise deal at Manchester United but the proposal fell through.

Forest coach Brian Eastick was aware of Laing from his time in charge of England youth.

Laing was signed by Sunderland from under the noses of his hometown club Newcastle in 2009.

At the time, he was likened to then England captain John Terry and was rated as one of the best prospects in the country.
