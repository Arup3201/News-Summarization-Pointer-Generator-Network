Less than twenty miles from Hollywood, in the glamorous seaside city of Malibu, California, is the one and a half mile patch of shore dubbed 'Billionaire's Beach.'

The deepest and driest and most picturesque of the exclusive area's beaches, Carbon Beach, as it is properly known, has attracted some of the most affluent and influential residents around.

The sandy strip boasts beach
 getaways owned by record mogul David Geffen, former Dodgers Chief 
Executive Jamie McCourt, and Oracle Chief Executive Larry Ellison.

It
 also has been home to many movie stars, including John Travolta, 
Courtney Cox and David Arquette. Top architects including Michael Graves
 and Richard Meier built many of the residences.

The beach's nickname, it seems, is an apt one and everyday beach goers have, for years, been unwelcome in the luxury playground.

However,
 access to the exclusive strip of sand will soon become easier as a 
Malibu homeowner settles a decade-long legal battle that will result in a
 paved path to Carbon Beach.

Case closed: Lisette Ackerberg has settled a longstanding dispute allow residents to access the exclusive Carbon Beach through her Malibu property

One of the beach's residents, Lisette Ackerberg, has settled a 
longstanding dispute with the California Coastal Commission over beach 
access, the commission said Friday.

Ackerberg, the widow of Minnesota 
developer Norman Ackerberg and the daughter of Raymond Friedman, founder
 of financial-services company Refco, has agreed to pay $1.1million and 
construct a paved pathway to be built by the end of 2014 from the 
Pacific Coast Highway across her property to the beach.

The
 Coastal Commission had been fighting since the early 2000s to get 
Ackerberg to comply with easements, or public rights of way, on her 
property.

Ackerberg sued the commission in 
2009 in an attempt to overturn a cease-and-desist order it had filed to 
force her to clear the easements.

Broken promises: Ackerberg had agreed to provide a public pathway to the beach as a condition of a development permit the family received in the 1980s that allowed them to build a mansion, three-car garage, tennis courts and pool

The
 disagreement underscores the difficulty of making good on a principal 
enshrined in California's constitution: that the state's beaches are 
public.

But private 
landowners are not always required to allow access to the coastline 
across their property, and many disputes have arisen over the years - 
often involving wealthy beachfront homeowners.

In
 a similar case in northern California, beach lovers on Thursday staged a
 protest at San Mateo County's Martin's Beach. The access road has been 
closed since soon after the property was bought by venture capitalist 
Vinod Khosla in 2008.

Earlier this week, Surfrider 
Foundation, a coastal protection group, filed a lawsuit to open access 
to Martin's Beach, arguing that closing the approach amounted to a 
violation of the state's Coastal Act, which governs issues including 
shoreline access.

In Ackerberg's case, she had been fighting two easements dating from the 1980s that provided for beach access on her property.

She had put up several impediments that blocked the easements, including large boulders, a fence, a wall and a tennis court.

A 2011 order from a California Superior Court judge required her to clear the right of way, but Ackerberg appealed the decision. Late last year, the state Supreme Court declined to hear the case.

‘Although the Commission and I disagreed for several years about the meaning of the terms of the permits governing my property, I am pleased that the matter has been resolved,’ Ackerberg said in a press release.

She also said she was pleased the access would be compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act, ‘something of great importance to me and my late husband.’

A lawyer for Ackerberg, David Codell, referred a caller back to her statement in the press release.

‘It's unfortunate that so much time, and so many resources had to be wasted over the last decade trying to get the public their rightful access to the beach,’ said Mary Shallenberger, chairwoman of the Coastal Commission.

‘But this is an outcome we can all feel proud of, and we are grateful to Mrs Ackerberg for stepping forward and doing the right thing for the people of California.’

The dispute echoes record mogul Geffen's long battle to prevent use of a walkway on his property along the same stretch of Malibu beach.

In 1983, Geffen agreed to allow a pathway to Carbon Beach when he sought permits for a pool and other additions, but he later filed suit to fight the access. In 2005, Geffen settled the suit and allowed the public to use the walkway.
