Sending a Christmas card should be a chance to wish season's greetings and make vague promises to catch up in the New Year.

But for political leaders it is increasingly a carefully choreographed, intensely observed photo opportunity to present themselves as a relaxed man of the people.

Labour leader Ed Miliband today released his smart-casual festive offering, featuring his wife and sons in a pose which would not look out of place in a mail order catalogue.

The Miliband family portrait shows Mr Miliband and wife Justine with their sons Daniel and Samuel.

It was taken during a walk along Brighton beach at the start of the Labour Party conference earlier this year as the family headed out to a play park before the heavy political agenda got under way.

In smart trousers and a grey pullover, Mr Miliband appears to be straining to look relaxed.

When the pictures were taken in September it was noted that they were markedly different to Gordon Brown’s refusal to be photographed with his own young children.

But Labour strategists made clear that they wanted to give Mrs Miliband a more high profile role in a bid to give her husband a popularity boost.

The release of the Labour leader's card comes after Number 10 revealed David Cameron’s three-year-old daughter Florence has been given a starring role in the Prime Minister’s official Christmas card - for the second time.

Greeting: Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife Samantha photographed with daughter Florence at 10 Downing Street for their 2013 Christmas card

The striking black and white portrait features Mr Cameron and wife Samantha hugging their daughter inside Number 10 in October.

The card will be sent around the globe to world leaders and dignitaries, as well as to senior figures in the UK.

Captured
by award-winning photographer Tom Stoddart, the picture shows the 
Camerons’ youngest child gripping her father’s neck while she snuggles 
against her mother.

It 
is striking that the three-year-old features so prominently because 
David Cameron has closely guarded his children’s privacy since moving to
Number 10 and usually requests that all photographs of them are 
pixelated. 

Mr Cameron has opted for a photograph of 
himself and wife Samantha each year since taking power in 2010, when 
they chose the photograph of the couple holding baby Florence on the 
steps of Number 10.

The outspoken MEP Godfrey Bloom does not take himself so seriously.

After
a year in which he has grabbed the headlines for outspoken comments 
about aid to ‘Bongo Bongo Land’ and women being ‘sluts’ for not doing 
the cleaning properly, the 64-year-old and his wife have posed for a 
self-mocking Christmas card.

The MEP for Yorkshire and the Humber, 
who quit the UK Independence Party in September to sit as an 
independent, clutches bongos given to him by a music shop while his wife
Katie is dressed as a ‘slut’.

The
photo, taken in the kitchen of the couple’s house in a village near 
Goole, East Yorkshire, will be on cards posted to friends and family.

But his old boss, UKIP leader Nigel Farage, takes a very different view about the trend for political leaders to feature in their own cards.

'Rest assured, any cards sent from family Farage will be suitably festive rather than have my face on it,' he said.

Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond revealed his official Christmas card last week, an imposing artwork of the fourth wise man who 
turned up too late to see Jesus.

He opted for the bleak, sinewy painting of Artaban by Scottish artist Peter Howson.

Festive? This painting of the fourth wise man Artaban by Peter Howson will grace the front of the First Minister Alex Salmond's 2013 charity Christmas card

The
artwork will be sold to raise money for charity, but some questioned 
whether its choice for a Christmas card was not very festive.

Since 2007 Mr Salmond 
has raised £148,000 for charities in Scotland through sales of the 
original artwork and limited edition prints of his official card.

Today
he unveiled the Howson painting, which will be sold at auction in the 
New Year with the proceeds shared between the Children's Hospice 
Association Scotland (Chas), CLIC Sargent, Scottish Catholic 
International Aid Fund (Sciaf) and Combat Stress, the charity chosen by 
the artist.

He insisted the image of Artaban is a ‘hugely appropriate’ work for his card.

Mr Salmond said: ‘The legend of 
Artaban, or the fourth wise man, is based on a novel by Henry van Dyke. 
It tells the tale of a Persian scholar who, delayed by helping the 
vulnerable, follows the star to Bethlehem but arrives just too late to 
herald the birth of the Christ child.

‘Thirty years on in Jerusalem, at Passover, Artaban is still searching.

‘Now
an old man, he parts with the last of his three gifts to Jesus, a 
sapphire, a ruby and a pearl, to save a young girl from slavery. 
However, in a dying vision, Artaban is comforted that his devotion to 
the distressed has secured him entrance to the kingdom of heaven.

‘The story reminds us that hope, faith and self-sacrifice are at the centre of the order of things.
