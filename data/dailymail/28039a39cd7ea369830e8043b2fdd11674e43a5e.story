For Rosa De Filippo it seemed like a reasonable expectation – a seat next to her partner as they flew out on holiday.

But when they head off to Sicily in August they will be sitting separately.

Their holiday company charges couples an extra fee so they can sit together on a plane – even if they are going on honeymoon.

A passenger was told it would cost £7.50 per seat to make sure she could sit with her fiance on flights for their upcoming £1,800 Thomson package holiday to Sicily

TUI Travel, which owns Thomson and 
First Choice, demands £7.50 per seat to guarantee a spot together. This 
amounts to £30 per couple for return flights.

Miss De Filippo, 43, and her partner 
were told they would have to pay the extra fee after they had already 
forked out £1,800 for their holiday.

She discovered the surcharge after 
booking the Thomson package holiday to the southern Italian island. When
 she viewed her pre-assigned seats online, the legal secretary saw they 
were separated by an aisle.

She rang customer services and tried to change positions, but was asked to pay £7.50 per alteration.

‘The agent assured me the charge was correct,’ she said. ‘He said they have had lots of complaints.’

Couples and friends would be charged by Thomson and First Choice to change their bookings so they could sit together - only parents with children would be exempt

Miss De Filippo, of Radlett, 
Hertfordshire, is refusing to pay the fee, so she and her partner will 
have to sit separately on the three-hour flight. ‘It just makes me 
seethe,’ she said.

Yesterday German-owned TUI Travel, 
which sells holidays to millions of Britons every year, confirmed that 
the fee applies to all holidaymakers flying with Thomson Airways apart 
from parents sitting with children. No exception is made for 
honeymooners.

All Thomson passengers and many First
 Choice passengers fly on Thomson Airways flights. A spokesman said: 
‘A  charge is applied for these services, giving customers the peace of 
mind that they will be seated together.’

A Thomson spokesman added: ‘Thomson 
Airways always tries to seat customers travelling together next to each 
other wherever possible. However, along with many other UK airlines, we 
offer an optional extra service whereby customers can pre-book specific 
seats.

‘This service not only guarantees that customers can sit together, but also allows them to choose their preferred seats.’

ABTA, the Travel Association told MailOnline that this was a system that other carriers also used: “Many airlines give the option of paying in advance for pre-allocated seating which has proved popular with passengers avoiding the need to check-in very early.

"You may well still sit together even if you have not used pre-allocation but booking in advance removes a degree of uncertainty. Airlines will always ensure that families with small children sit close to each other.”

Last year TUI, which made pre-tax 
profit of £390million in 2012, came under fire after claims it was 
forcing holidaymakers who had already paid for trips to shell out extra 
cash before they departed to cover exchange rate and fuel price 
fluctuations.

A school ski trip was told to pay an 
extra £13 for every child before they could travel, while customers for 
an adventure holiday to New Zealand faced demands for £200 more.
