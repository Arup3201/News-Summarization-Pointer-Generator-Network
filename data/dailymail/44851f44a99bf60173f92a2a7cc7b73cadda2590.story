Two sisters were surprised to find they were sharing a maternity ward after they gave birth on the same day.

Hazel March and Carol Simms, both from Cumbria, had three weeks between their due dates but their children will now share a birthday after Hazel went into labour early and Carol was induced as she was 12 days overdue.

The siblings ended up giving birth on the same day, in the same hospital, and were put on neighbouring beds in the same ward.

Hazel, 30, went into labour with her first child 10 days early and had a boy, William Thomas March,  weighing 7lb 12oz, at 3.13pm on Sunday 30 June.

Meanwhile, her older sister Carol, 32, had been induced as she was 12 days after her June 18 due date.

She gave birth to a girl, Elliott Jade Lee, weighing 8lb 8oz, at 11.06pm, less than eight hours after her cousin had arrived at Furness General Hospital, Cumbria.

Hazel, from Barrow, said: 'Obviously they wanted to be born on the same day. Elliott did leave it a bit late but she made it!

'It's nice because we'll be able to help each other out, and we can have big family parties on their birthdays. They'll share those really special occasions like their 18ths and 21sts.'

'When I realised they had arrived on the same day, I couldn't believe it'

The cousins' shared birthday also meant Carol was able to support her sister through the early stages of labour.

Carol, of Barrow Island, who also has a son Connor, 12, and daughter, Amy, eight, said: 'Hazel was scared, because it was her first time and she was in agony, so it was nice to be able to keep her spirits up.'

While her sister was in labour, Carol was induced at around 2pm. Hazel's son was delivered later that afternoon but Carol believed it was unlikely her baby would arrive on the same day.

However, her labour pains started 8pm and her daughter was born three hours later.

Fun times ahead: The cousins will be able to have joint birthday parties

She said: 'When I'd given birth, James, my partner, said it was six minutes past 11, and I thought he meant in the morning, because when you're in labour you just lose all track of time completely.

'When I realised they had actually arrived on the same day, I couldn't believe it.

'When we first both found out we were pregnant, Hazel did say, "You never know, they could be born on the same day".

'But it seemed a real long shot for me to be nearly two weeks late and her more than a week early. It's really weird!'
