A Harvard student group that relishes in conversations about erotic sex has been officially recognized by the prestigious university based in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

The group, which goes by ‘Harvard College Munch,’ first began its meetings in one of the university’s dining halls to discuss personal stories and broader issues related to BDSM and other forms of ‘kinky sex’, the Harvard Crimson reports.

Munch’s membership has grown to about 30 members from seven when it began more than a year ago and is one of 15 student organization that will be approved by Harvard’s Committee on Student Life this Friday.

None of the group’s members quoted by the media have been willing to give their full names.

One group member, who goes by ‘Marie,’ told the New York Observer that she enjoys ‘Bondage, handcuffs and ice play.”

‘I’ve been hit with a riding crop, a belt, a paddle, canes, a flogger,’ she said, ‘Floggers are my favorite.'

The group’s founder, who goes by ‘Michael,’ said there are many benefits to being officially recognized on campus such as being able to poster for.

The expected approval from the school’s student life board will entitle Munch to officially meet for on-campus meals, promote on school grounds and apply for grants from the school's Drug and Alcohol Peer Advisors organization.

‘If you come to campus and you have the sexual interests we represent, you may not even suspect that such a group exists,’ Michael told the Crimson.

Munch attempted to gain recognition from the college last semester, but due to troubles finding a stable adviser and constitution problems left the group waiting another few months.

‘Pretty much everyone who joins this club always thought they were alone,’ Michael said.
