With yards of bunting and flags festooning the shops, London's Regent Street has taken on an unusually colourful appearance ahead of next week's Coronation celebrations.

Sunday is the 60th anniversary of the coronation of Her Majesty the Queen and the capital is gearing up for several days of festivities, although the main event is on Tuesday when the Queen and the Royal family will attend a special service at Westminster Abbey.

Regent Street, which formed part of the procession route during the 1953 Coronation, is marking the occasion with a display of 189 purple and gold flags.

Change: While the architecture remains the same, the cars that whiz down the street have had an update

And as the stunning pictures of the London 
street show, the capital would still be a familiar place for the 
Londoners who thronged the streets 60 years ago.

In a photo taken from a similar angle in 1953, Regent Street looks almost identical to the 2013 version, although the cars and buses have changed.

The Coronation itself took place 16 months 
after the Queen acceded to the throne, allowing a period of mourning for
 her father King George VI and time to get the detailed preparations in 
place.

It was a day of pomp and pageantry as thousands took to the streets despite the rainy weather to see the Queen’s procession.

An estimated 27 million people in 
Britain watched the deeply religious ceremony on the television, while more than 8,200 guests were 
seated in the Abbey to witness the historic proceedings.

The 60th anniversary of the Queen’s 
coronation in 2013 is set to be a more low-key affair than last year's Diamond Jubilee, with commemorations 
centering on the Queen’s return to her Coronation church with a service 
for 2,000 guests in the Abbey on June 4.

Joined by a supporting cast of 
royals including the Duke of Edinburgh, the Prince of Wales, the Duchess
 of Cornwall, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry, the 
Queen will listen to an address by the Archbishop of Canterbury and a 
reading by Prime Minister David Cameron.

The Queen as yet has no public events in the diary for the actual anniversary on Sunday when she is expected to be at Windsor.

In the summer, a four-day Coronation Festival is being held in the gardens of Buckingham Palace from July 11 to July 14.

Organised by the Royal Warrant Holders
 Association, the ticketed event, which has now sold out, will showcase 
over 200 of the brands which have supplied goods or services for at 
least five years to the Households of the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh 
or the Prince of Wales.

Galas in the evening will include performances by Katherine Jenkins, Russell Watson, Katie Melua and The Feeling.

Westminster
 Abbey is also staging a number of events to mark the milestone 
including Coronation! - a photography exhibition, which runs until 
September 27 and charts the preparations at the Abbey ahead of the 
Coronation

For its annual 
summer opening this year, Buckingham Palace will stage a special 
exhibition dedicated to the coronation and display the coronation 
outfits worn by the Queen and other members of the Royal Family.

The London Eye is renaming its second pod the Coronation Capsule with a plaque-unveiling ceremony on Sunday.

Amid
 the celebrations, the royals are eagerly awaiting the arrival of their 
newest member who will one day be crowned at their own coronation.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s baby - a future king or queen - is due in July.

Along with the Coronation, 1953 saw epic sporting achievements, with
 England winning the Ashes for the first time in 19 years while the 
champion flat jockey Sir Gordon Richards won the Derby on his 28th and 
last attempt.

In the FA Cup Final, Stanley Matthews’ inspirational 
performance during Blackpool’s 4-3 win against Bolton Wanderers led to 
the match being dubbed the 'Matthews Final'.

Then on the morning of the Coronation -
 much to the delight of the Royal Family - came the news that the 
British Everest Expedition had succeeded in reaching the summit of the 
world’s highest mountain.

But 1953 was not without tragedy. 
There were floods on England’s east coast, where more than 300 people 
lost their lives.

The new Queen spent much of February touring the 
stricken areas, meeting those affected.

Winston Churchill presided over a 
Conservative government and there was still rationing for staple 
foodstuffs such as sugar, eggs and sausages.

Britain’s cities remained scarred by 
the German bombing. Bomb sites were used as car parks or playgrounds but
 there was insufficient wealth to rebuild completely.

The world political situation remained to be volatile, with communism in the East the new perceived 
enemy to the capitalist West.

The Korean War was raging into its third 
year, with British troops fighting alongside a multinational force, 
including Americans and Australians. On July 27, 1953, an armistice was 
signed, by which point more than 1,000 British servicemen had lost their 
lives.

The St Edward’s Crown, made in 
1661, was the crown placed on the Queen’s head during the Coronation 
service. In its current form, it was first used by Charles II but it is 
thought that the lower part might be from Edward the Confessor’s crown.

The orb, also made in 1661, is a 
globe of gold surrounded by a cross girdled by a band of diamonds, 
emeralds, rubies, sapphires and pearls with a large amethyst at the 
summit.

The Coronation ring, also known as 
The Wedding Ring of England, was worn by the Queen on the fourth finger 
of her right hand in accordance with tradition. It was made for the 
Coronation of King William IV in 1831.
