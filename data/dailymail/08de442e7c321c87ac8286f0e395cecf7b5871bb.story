Edward Snowden has been heralded as a hero and cursed as a traitor. His name is known across the world for his decision to leak classified information about secret NSA surveillance programs. In news interviews he has portrayed himself as a serious man who sacrificed his comfortable lifestyle for his principles.

But before all that, he was geeky high school dropout who loved playing the video game Tekken, was obsessed with Japanese culture and anime and joked about attracting 'nubile young girls' with his 'girlish figure.'

A 2002 profile he posted on the defunct anime site Ryuhana Press reveals a window into Snoden's personality as a computer savvy 18-year-old. 

The Maryland teenager's parents had just divorced and he was working for friends, who set up Ryuhana Press as a way to sell Japanese anime and magna artwork.

The revelations come as Congressman Peter King, the New York Republican who is the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, called for the arrest of Guardian journalist Glen Greenwald, the reporter who broke many of Snowden's leaks and has worked closely with the whistleblower.

Several top politicians, both Republicans and Democrats, have called for the arrest and prosecution of Snowden for exposing the National Security Agency Secrets.

King is the first to call for the arrest of a journalist in the case.

Snowden went by the nicknames 'The True 
HOOHA' and 'Phish' and spoke in hacker slang, referring to his 'lamer 
friends' - non-hackers - and talked about attending Otakon, a convention
 for anime lovers in Baltimore, Maryland.

'I like my girlish figure that attracts 
girls,' he wrote, 'and I like my lamer friends. That's the best 
biography you'll get out of me, coppers!'

He joked that he 'got bullied' into being an editor on the website by a gaggle of artists and 'beautiful nubile young girls.'

Ohio newspaper reporter Matt Skrajner dug up several photo collages that Snowden posted advertising fake hip-hop albums produce by the non-existent record label 'Pimp Daddy Records.'

As an adult, the former CIA employee has
 not left much of a digital trail on the Internet. Snowden, who turns 30
 later this month, does not appear to be active on social media sites 
like Facebook or Twitter - at least not under his own name.

But the website of Ryuhana Press, a now 
defunct start-up that had sold anime art, offers a glimpse of Snowden as
 a youth.

As its web editor, Snowden's profile page is a mix of truth, 
sarcasm and silly jokes.

For example, he listed his correct 
birthday - June 21, 1983 - and noted that it falls on the Summer 
Solstice, the longest day of the year. But he also claimed to be 37 
years old and to have fathered two preteen children.

'I really am a nice guy,' Snowden wrote 
on his profile page. 'You see, I act arrogant and cruel because I was 
not hugged enough as a child, and because the public education system 
turned it's (sic) wretched, spiked back on me.'

Republican Congressman Peter King said Glenn Greenwald, the Guardian journalist who printed the NSA leaks, should be prosecuted

Fighting back: Greenwald has fired back, saying that King's allegations were based on lies

He wrote that he favored purple sunglasses and  he praised the Baltimore Orioles baseball team.

Reuters viewed the website on Tuesday and contacted former company employees for comment. On Wednesday, the website had been taken down.

Details of Snowden's past 
emerged Wednesday as news broke that he gave an interview to the South 
China Morning Post in which he claimed that the NSA has hacked the 
country's universities, businesses and politicians.

He said the agency had hundreds of
 targets - including the Chinese University of Hong Kong - from as far 
back as 2009, but that these were just a fraction of the 61,000 NSA 
hacking operations carried out globally.

He added that none of the documents revealed any information about Chinese military systems.

'We hack network backbones – like 
huge internet routers, basically – that give us access to the 
communications of hundreds of thousands of computers without having to 
hack every single one,' he explained.

Edward Snowden posted several 'posters' for made-up hip-hop albums on his Ryuhana Press profile

June 9, 2013 - Snowden reveals himself in an interview with The Guardian

June 12, 2013 - Snowden gives an interview to the South China Morning Post in which he claimed that the NSA has hacked the country's universities, businesses and politicians

The hour-long interview, which took 
part in a secret location on Wednesday, came after Snowden fled to Hong 
Kong from his home in Hawaii on May 20 after leaking sensitive documents
 about the NSA about its data-collection programs.

Peter King, the controversial House Republican in charge of national security issues, said that Greenwald - the first journalist to publish Snowden's claims, should be prosecuted.

He told Fox News on Wednesday: 'Not 
only did he disclose this information, he has said he has names of CIA 
agents and assets around the world and they’re threatening to disclose 
that. ... No right is absolute. And even the press has certain 
restrictions...

'But in this case, when you have 
someone who has disclosed secrets like this and threatens to release 
more, then to me, yes, there has to be, there should be legal action 
taken against him. This is a very unusual case with life and death 
implications for Americans.'

Greenwald has responded with vigorous denials.

'Just watched the King video; everything he said is based on the blatant *lie that I threatened to disclose names of CIA covert agents,' he tweeted.

Later, he said: 'Only In America can a renowned and devoted terrorism supporter like Peter King be the arbiter of national security and treason.'

King is noted for his support of the Irish Republican Army when the group was targeting British soldiers and civilians with bomb attacks.

Greenwald is a natural born American citizen. There are few recorded examples in American history - and none in the post-September 11-era - of journalists being prosecuted by the U.S. government for publishing classified leaks.

Photographs uploaded by friends for 
Snowden's 19th birthday show a young man pulling down his pants for his 
colleagues, putting a clothespin on his chest, and dancing.

Yearbook photos of Snowden in middle school and high school show a clean-cut, smiling young man.

A blog entry from a company employee
 teased, 'Who is he? What does he do? Does he really love himself as 
much as his shameless marketing would have you believe?'

Snowden wrote on his profile that he 
liked online role-playing games (RPG). 'I always wanted to write RPG 
campaigns with my spare time, but I'll get about three missions in and 
scrap the world for my next, better, powergamin' build.'

Snowden
 said he liked playing the popular fighting video game Tekken. He was so
 skilled that he attracted a gathering of fans at the 2002 Anime USA 
convention, wrote a co-worker on another part of the site.

'He tends to 
spontaneously be a ray of sunshine and inspiration. He's a great 
listener, and he's eager to help people improve themselves.'

The
 co-worker did not reply to inquiries from Reuters on Wednesday. Ryuhana
 closed in 2004 as the primary proprietors went off to college and 
opened a new business in California, according to the website. Other 
contributors to the site could not be reached for comment.

The defunct company listed an address in Fort Meade, Md., next door to the National Security Agency.

Joker: 'I like my girlish figure that attracts girls,' Snowden wrote on his online bio, 'and I like my lamer friends. That's the best biography you'll get out of me, coppers!'
