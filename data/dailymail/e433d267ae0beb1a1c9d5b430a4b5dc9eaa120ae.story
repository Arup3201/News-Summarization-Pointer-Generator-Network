The countryside is under siege from housing developers exploiting the Government’s relaxed planning laws, campaigners have warned.

The number of homes planned for the country’s green belt has increased 38 per cent in less than two years, according to a study by the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE).

Nearly 220,000 houses are in the pipeline for green belt land – up 61,000 on CPRE’s last count in August 2013 – and the campaigners say the increase is a direct result of the Government’s National Planning Policy Framework, which aimed to speed up decisions and boost house building.

The framework, introduced three years ago, ordered planning boards to shift the ‘presumption’ of their decisions ‘in favour’ of development.

The Coalition has repeatedly said that there were sufficient regulations in place to protect rural Britain from inappropriate developments.

Just this month David Cameron said ‘the green belt is protected’ and that he viewed its continued preservation as ‘paramount’.

But the new figures lay bare the extent to which developers have been able to move on to prime rural sites, where they are often able to charge a premium for luxury homes.

In its analysis of nine English regions, the CPRE paper shows that councillors and planning inspectors have signed off major releases of green belt over the past 19 months. The Metropolitan green belt which encircles London is particularly under pressure, with the number of houses planned rising from 32,500 to 87,000 since the summer of 2013.

Just over 12 per cent of England is designated as green belt land, a status introduced in the 1950s to protect the countryside around major towns and cities from urban sprawl.

But a Daily Mail investigation revealed last year that speculators are so confident they can exploit new loopholes, they offer farmers ‘no-win-no-fee’ deals to get planning permission.

The disdain with which some developers treat green belt land was revealed at the National Planning Summit in London this week.

Mark Sitch, senior partner at planning consultancy Barton Willmore, told the conference that planning restrictions on rural land should be dismantled. He said: ‘The new government has to have the ambition and in that first year tackle the green belt. The green belt is a constraint on economic growth of our cities.’

This Government and its predecessors have emphasised the need to build an estimated 200,000 new homes a year to battle the housing crisis.

But campaigners say there is no need to concrete over the countryside to meet that aim.

Experts estimate there is space for a million new homes on previously developed ‘brownfield’ sites, including disused industrial land and empty housing plots.

Paul Miner, planning campaign manager at CPRE, said: ‘We need to strengthen green belt protection, not weaken it.

‘Our new research shows that large-scale development is already planned – despite existing protections, the availability of brownfield land and community objections.’

Planning minister Brandon Lewis last night defended the Government’s record. He said: ‘The green belt is 34,000 hectares larger than in 1997, and green belt development is at its lowest rate since modern records began in 1989.

‘This Government has safeguarded national green belt protection and increased protection of important green spaces.’
