The political aide who became Tony Blair’s ‘office wife’ has spoken for the first time of her tensions with Mrs Blair.

Anji Hunter was the former prime minister’s ‘gatekeeper’, controlling access to No 10 and, until now, keeping its secrets.

But in an interview published yesterday the 57-year-old revealed that Cherie Blair resented intrusions into her family time.

‘Cherie would, rightly, try to ring-fence family time and I’d be like, “Sorry, Cherie, I know it’s your wedding anniversary, but something’s cropped up...”,’ she said.

‘I don’t think Tony was entirely helpful on that score.

‘He’d probably blame me, saying, “I don’t know what Anji’s up to”.’ Miss Hunter, who is married to Sky News political editor Adam Boulton, said rumours of tensions between her and Mrs Blair were overblown.

Mrs Blair ‘was the rock of that family’, she said, adding: ‘Do I blame her for being a bit shirty with us from time to time? No, I do not. As the office wife, I was often the harbinger of bad news. She got an unfairly hard time.’

Miss Hunter, who knew Mr Blair from school and Oxford, broke her silence while drumming up publicity for a new role, promoting a prize offered by the Royal Academy of Engineering.

She left Downing Street for a short but lucrative stint as director of communications for BP.

Miss Hunter denied there had been a romance between her and Mr Blair, pointing out that she was the girlfriend of his guitarist friend Mark Ellen in his student rock band, Ugly Rumours.

‘We were always like brother and sister in that regard,’ she said. ‘He just happened to be my best mate from school.

'Even as a teenager, he was always confident, funny, sure of himself, but not cocky – intelligent and interested in all sorts of things, but not political at all.

‘He wanted to be a rock star, and he’d have been a great one. He was going to be successful at whatever he went into, he had that drive, ambition.

‘He was very good with people, popular, academic, good at sport, plays – charismatic – a natural leader.’

Miss Hunter said Mr Blair saw her as a vital link to the hearts and minds of Middle England. ‘I was big-tent girl,’ the former private schoolgirl told the Sunday Times.

‘Open up those flaps and keep them open ... Tony was totally behind that, it was his invention. But I was the big tent writ large.

‘Tony’s strength was in the fantastic team he had around him ... and that’s all true about me being the voice of Middle England. I lived in Sussex, my kids went to the local school, my friends were farmers and builders and teachers and yacht chandlers.

She added: ‘Working in No 10, it is just adrenaline every day. There is  nothing like it...  very high-octane stuff. It was all top secret: It was Paddy Ashdown talking about possibly having a coalition, or Ken Clarke and Michael Heseltine discussing Europe – these were people who were not natural bedfellows of ours.’

Miss Hunter also told how she resented that other male aides and spin doctors, such as Alastair Campbell and Jonathan Powell, played down her contribution in their accounts of Labour’s years in power – and had earned twice as much as she did.
