Lewis MacLeod knew something definitely wasn’t right when a lingering sense of fatigue saw him trudge off the Ibrox turf last January and make his way down the tunnel in a daze.

Despite his tender years, he had been feeling the pace in recent games for Ally McCoist’s side - but had never felt as shattered as this.

Llittle did the talented teenager realise that he was experiencing something far more serious than mere exhaustion following his exertions on the park.

Recovery: Rangers midfielder Lewis MacLeod is continuing to make his comeback from a viral infection

Not even in his worst nightmares could MacLeod have anticipated that he would miss the rest of the season or - more frighteningly - be told that his substitution just before the hour mark during that 3-2 league win over Arbroath might be his last-ever appearance on a football field.

Yet that was the frightening reality facing the young Rangers midfielder when tests revealed that his excessive tiredness had been caused by a viral infection attacking the muscles around his heart.

An awful six-month spell in limbo ensued during which time MacLeod feared that his career in the game might be over.

That he has now come through his health scare - and has finally been given the all-clear from the virus by medics after a period of rest and recuperation - has given the youngster what feels like a second lease of life.

He duly marked his comeback earlier this month with a spectacular goal in a 4-2 victory over Fulham behind closed doors at Murray Park. Since then he has put in impressive performances on Rangers’ tour of California against Ventura County Fusion and, in particular, during Saturday night’s 2-1 win over Sacramento Republic.

Speaking for the first time about his ordeal on Monday, MacLeod, now 20, revealed how the potential enormity of his situation only really hit home when a cousin asked him if he had made alternative career plans.

Career-threatening: MacLeod was worried that he may never be able to kick a football again

However, now that he is back in McCoist’s first-team plans, he has declared himself fit and ready to help the Ibrox club return to the Scottish top flight.

‘A couple of months into last season I remember feeling tired, but I just put that down to the fact that I was playing regularly for the first team,’ recalled Macleod.

‘I didn’t think too much about it but then I started getting more and more tired.

‘In the couple of weeks before I finally stopped playing, I was getting so knackered in matches that I sat back and knew that something might be wrong.

‘It was frustrating for me because I wasn’t playing as well as I could and I was wondering what was wrong.

‘In that game when I came off (the League One match against Arbroath) I felt faint and dizzy.

‘I had tests done afterwards and the results were low. Then a second test showed that I wasn’t getting any better – and that underlined it for me.

‘It was kind of a frightening time for me but I did well to try and put it to the back of my mind,’ added Macleod.

‘The doctors couldn’t tell me what was happening, they couldn’t assure me that I would be back in six months or whatever.

‘So it was really just a waiting game to see how the results came back.

‘But a lot of people, even the doctor himself, admitted to me that it could have been the end (of my career).

Back in the action: MacLeod is now fully recovered after a period of rest and recuperation

‘I didn’t really think about it. But then my cousin asked me how I would feel if the results didn’t go according to plan and what I would do. I kind of thought about it then and it was quite scary.

‘But then the results came back after that and they were good and I couldn’t have felt any happier.

‘It was a viral infection that had affected my organs and it was scary – but I’ m back to normal now and hopefully it’s all behind me.’

Even in his darkest days, MacLeod never allowed himself to think about a career without football.

But he admits that his recovery and return to the first team feels as if he has been given a second chance in the game.

‘In a way, it makes me appreciate things more, thinking that I might not have been able to play any more,’ said the youngster, who has made 39 appearances for the club, scoring eight goals in the process.

‘That makes you think about it and makes you realise what you have here.

‘And that you have to grab it with both hands. In a way that’s been good for me, because it has made me push on.

‘But I never really allowed myself to wonder what I would do if I wasn’t able to play football.

‘I didn’t want to think about that. I didn’t want to put in my head what I would do if I couldn’t play again.

Far flung: Rangers are currently on a pre-season tour of North America and are in Canada right now

‘But luckily enough that’s not an issue now.

‘It’s so good to be back playing again. It’s a huge weight off my shoulders knowing that I am back and kicking a ball around again.

‘So far everything is looking good for me after six months out.

‘I owe a lot to my pals, my family, the manager, coaches and team-mates for their support. And I especially owe the doc and physio because they took a lot of time – their own time as well – keeping me sane and keeping me going.’

For Macleod, the aim is now to help Rangers complete their journey back to the top of Scottish football after the club’s descent to the bottom tier. But the Scotland under-21 international knows they will have to be at their best to pip Hibs and Hearts to the Championship crown ths coming season.

‘I’ve always said I wanted to play for Rangers at the top level. And, hopefully, all going well I can get through this season with no injuries or silly things and then I can look forward to playing in the Premiership.

‘I am feeling good and I am now back to full pelt.

‘Of course, I’ve been out for six months so I’m going to be tired but it’s not like how I felt back then when the problem first arose.

‘I feel good and I just want to work on my fitness and get more games in,’ he said.

‘There’s going to be a lot of interest in the Championship this season because there are a few good teams in that league.

‘It’s probably more difficult and competitive than the Premiership. But we’re all looking forward to the challenge at Rangers and hopefully we can finish top.’
