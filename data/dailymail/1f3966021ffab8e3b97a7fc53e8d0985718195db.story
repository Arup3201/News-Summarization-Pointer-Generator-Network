It looks like a typical Christmas party spread of mince pies, a cheeseboard, sausages, crisps and nuts... but all the festive food in these pictures are made out of cake. 

The skillfully-crafted baked treats were created by dedicated amateur cook Debbie Harwood in her kitchen in Rogate, West Sussex. 

The talented 47-year-old spent an estimated 200 hours over seven weeks working on her sweet feast, including hand-making hundreds of nuts and even crinkle-cut crisps. 

The perfectionist often worked through the night to ensure her fake food looked as tasty and as realistic as possible - despite not liking to eat cake.

The jewellery designer liked working in miniature as it allowed her to put more details into her creations. She stayed up all night baking 

Mrs Harwood lovingly crafted prawn vol-au-vents, cheese twists and a selection of dips - including sliced 'vegetables' - out of home-baked cakes, icing sugar and fondant.

She said: 'It really was a labour of love, especially because I don't like eating cake.

'I'd stay up all night working on my creations - it's great fun but can get a bit tedious at times.

'Making all those nuts and sausage rolls was really repetitive. I like working in miniature, because it allows me to put more detail in.'

Despite having a real talent at baking beautiful cakes, Mrs Harwood said she doesn't like eating them 

It's all made from cake: Hot dogs with mustard, ketchup, lettuce and onions stuffed into hot dog rolls 

Mrs Harwood, 47, made all the sweet treats in the kitchen of her home in Rogate as part of a 12-strong team of bakers tasked with making a Santa's Grotto out of sweets.

The artist, who works as a jewellery maker, reckons she even lost weight during the mammoth challenge.

She said: 'I wouldn't recommend it as a diet, but I did drop a few pounds.

'When you're surrounded by all that sweet food, it really puts you off eating.

'I just use ordinary cake decorating tools, and my hands.

'I loved making the little mince pies - although my husband got confused and bit into one thinking it was real.'

Her impressive display was on show at the Cake International exhibition at the NEC in Birmingham, where she received great praise from competitors.

Mrs Harwood added: 'It was absolutely fantastic when all the cakes were put together.

'The whole room smelled of sugar and it looked amazing. We had some brilliant comments.

'People couldn't believe my cheese platter was all sugar and the children loved the burgers and the hot dogs.

'They said such lovely things I felt like crying.'

Mrs Harwood's creation were so realistic that her husband helped himself to a fake mince pie (pictured), mistakenly thinking it was a real one 

The amateur cook created an entire Christmas party feast including an elaborate cheese platter, crackers and butter, out of cake
