A father yesterday told how his family was ‘broken’ by the death of their two-year-old daughter after she trapped her neck in the cord of a window blind.

Two-year-old Emily Warner was left paralysed and suffered brain damage.

She died months later following breathing and heart problems.

Tragic: Emily Warner who died after she was accidentally hanged by a window blind cord at her home in Royston, Hertfordshire

Emily's father Jamie Warner, 30, has launched a campaign with his family against unsafe blind cords (left) and Emily, with her grandfather Graham Warner (right), after the accident when she was left brain damaged for three months

The inquest at Hatfield Coroner's Court heard Emily's father Jamie Warner found the two-year-old unconscious in her bedroom

Speaking after an inquest yesterday her father Jamie, 30, said: ‘Emmie was the light of our lives, such a wonderful little girl.

‘There is no one thing that is responsible, it was an accident. We didn’t see any danger because we weren’t looking.’

The little girl had been put to bed, 
but stood up on the end of her bed-frame and was climbing across her 
window sill when the accident happened.

Mr Warner found her hanging unconscious on her tiptoes when he walked past her room a few minutes later.

He attempted to resuscitate her as his wife called an ambulance.

The tragedy happened on the evening of August 27 last year at the family home in Royston, Hertfordshire.

Emily remained in a coma in hospital 
for a week. When she came round she was left unable to walk, talk or 
feed herself because her brain had been starved of oxygen.

Two-year-olds Arthur Winfield  (pictured above) and Emily Warner died following similar accidents over the past few months.

Both the families have launched a safety campaign to warn other families of the dangers.

Arthur's
father Oli, who lives in Markyate, Hertfordshire, said: 'You always 
think your home is going to be a safe place, especially for your 
children.

'We are totally 
devastated at the loss of our precious boy and urge people to take heed 
of the safety messages being made available through this campaign.'

Arthur's accident was in the morning of Thursday, January 5, when he was in his bedroom.

He died at Great Ormond Street Hospital in the early hours of Tuesday, January 10.

An inquest has not taken place yet.

Despite doctors observing on the 
previous day that she was improving, she died in hospital following 
breathing problems and a heart attack on December 1.

At least 19 children have died since 
1999 in similar circumstances to Emily’s. Yesterday, Hertfordshire 
Coroner’s Court heard how Mr Warner and his wife  Tracey, who also have a
four-year-old son, James, could ‘have done nothing more’.

A verdict of accidental death was recorded.

Speaking after the accident, but 
before Emily’s death, Mr Warner said: ‘James had been naughty so he had 
been sent to bed at the same time as Emily.

‘When I went to tell him off for 
making a noise, I checked in on her. Then I saw her hanging by the 
window. If James hadn’t been sent to bed early I might not have gone to 
check on her in time.’

The hearing comes after toddler 
Arthur Winfield, also two, had a similar accident with a blind cord in 
his bedroom in Markyate, Hertfordshire, on January 5. He died in 
hospital five days later.

Since the tragedy, the Warners have
helped to promote the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents and
British Blind and Shutter Association’s Make It Safe campaign.

It is 
calling for improvements to safety standards in blinds, such as 
chain-break connections, to prevent further deaths.

The couple told how the day after the accident they replaced all their vertical blinds with net curtains.

Mr Warner, who works for a chemical 
manufacturer said: ‘We don’t want other families to suffer in the way we
have.

'By taking some simple steps with your blinds you can protect your
children.’

Coroner Edward Thomas told the Warners: ‘This is so awful. I applaud you for trying to help other people.’
