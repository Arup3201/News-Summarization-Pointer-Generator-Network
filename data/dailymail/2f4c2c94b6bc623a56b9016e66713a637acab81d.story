Belgian pair Marouane Fellaini and Adnan Januzaj were back in training at Carrington, but Fellaini's future at Manchester Untied is far from secure.

The former Everton man signed for the club last summer in a Â£27m deal after United failed in their bid to bring in Cesc Fabregas.

But, like David Moyes, Fellaini failed to settle in Manchester and after being left out of the club's US tour the 26-year-old's future at the club looks in doubt.

Waffle: Fellaini's omission from the US tour has caused speculation about whether the Belgian may leave

Signing the powerful Belgian midfielder was seen as a desperate move by many after Manchester United failed to activate his release during the stipulated time period, and then signed him shortly afterwards for more money.

it became clear he was never the then-champions' first choice and as the criticism increased Fellaini's form suffered.

The World Cup offered some brief respite for him - and his performances improved - but after returning to Manchester and training without the first team, van Gaal may see Fellaini's future as lying elsewhere.
