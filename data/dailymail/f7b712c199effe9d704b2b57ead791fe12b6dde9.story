Sunderland are fighting to keep hold of miracle manager Gus Poyet as an internal power struggle ensues at the Stadium of Light.

The Black Cats beat West Brom on Wednesday to become only the second club to escape Premier League relegation after being bottom of the table at Christmas.

But Poyet’s future is far from certain despite his heroics in keeping the club in the top-flight - there is a clause in his contract that allows him to leave for a new job this summer 
which was activated by Sunderland avoiding relegation.

Uncertain: Gus Poyet could leave Sunderland this summer - despite keeping them club in the Premier League

Delighted: The Black Cats retained their top flight status with Wednesday night's win against West Brom

Poyet will hold talks with owner Ellis Short and Margaret Byrne after Sunday’s clash against Swansea, a meeting that is likely to prove pivotal in determining the Uruguayan’s future.

The former Chelsea midfielder, who is in a strong position after his excellent work following his arrival at the Stadium of Light, wants greater control over the club’s footballing operation.

Poyet’s official job title at the Sunderland is head coach, but it is understood he wants a role more geared towards what a traditional football manager would do.

The 46-year-old is understood to have a good relationship with sporting director Lee Congerton, who will be at the forefront of the club’s summer recruitment drive.

But Sunderland's transfer policy will be a key discussion point when summit talks take place. 

Questions: The Sunderland board have reservations about some of Poyet's signings, including Liam Bridcutt

There remain reservations from the club 
hierarchy about Poyet’s January signings, Oscar Ustari, Ignacio Martin 
Scocco and Liam Bridcutt.

Ustari hasn’t played a league game since arriving from Almeria, Scocco hasn’t started a single game while Bridcutt has recently lost his place in the starting line-up.

Another factor could be whether other Premier League clubs dispense with their managers and try to tempt Poyet.
