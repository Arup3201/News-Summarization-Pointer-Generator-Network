During a month filled with dropped points and squandered chances, Liverpool have missed an absent striker and, after Everton’s visit, they do so once more.

Liverpool, of course, are a different proposition without Luis Suarez but the player they could have done with most in the 223rd Merseyside derby was his sidekick. Daniel Sturridge’s injury has proven damaging.

Sturridge has spent most of September with a thigh problem sustained, much to Brendan Rodgers’ anger, on England duty; the longer he has been out, the clearer his importance has become. Liverpool have taken one point from a possible nine without him and need his speed and ruthlessness.

Had Sturridge, rather than Mario Balotelli, provided the spear to Liverpool’s attack on Saturday, the game would surely have been taken away from Everton’s grasp long before Phil Jagielka slammed in an extraordinary injury-time effort to cancel out Steven Gerrard’s free-kick.

Balotelli had two glorious opportunities, either side of half-time, from around six yards but fluffed both. 

The second miss in the 67th minute, with the goal almost at his mercy, left Rodgers screaming in frustration. Sturridge would not have been so wasteful.

The sooner he can come back, the better for Rodgers and Liverpool. Sturridge was in training on Sunday and joined by the Liverpool manager, who also took part in a series of sprints, slaloms, jogs and agility drills using rope ladders under the eye of two of the club’s coaching staff.

Mario Balotelli missed two good chances on Saturday, including this effort which was saved by Tim Howard

Basle defender Taulant Xhaka scored his first goal of the season but the weekend Superleague pace-setters could only draw 1-1 with Thun after Berat Sadik equalised in the final minute. Liverpool and Basle have met twice before, both times in the group phase of the Champions League in 2002-03. Both matches ended in draws.

The forward looked pain-free as he completed the workout but the midweek Champions League trip to Basle may be too soon.

‘We needed to see if he was going to train on the Friday to get him through to the Saturday but the message on Thursday was that he would struggle,’ said Rodgers. ‘He wasn’t close to playing. I will see how he is (for Basle). 

'He wasn’t far away but not close enough to be on the bench. That pace (Sturridge has) through the middle can help, as you know. But whatever part of the game he comes on, he is a top talent. We want to score goals but as the season goes on it will become better and better.

Steven Gerrard is now the highest scorer in Merseyside derbies in the Premier League with nine goals. Ian Rush (13) holds the record in league games.

‘I think the game against Everton was a step towards that. It was an excellent performance against a very good side and a game in which we were clearly the better team.’

For Everton manager Roberto Martinez there was feeling a season that has stuttered might turn on the missile Jagielka launched into the Kop End net. 

‘We needed something like that,’ said Martinez. ‘When you are 2-0 up against Arsenal at home and draw and then at Leicester you draw when the ball gets deflected and ends up in your net, it shatters the confidence. This is an incredible moment. Football’s Gods gave us something back.’

Mamadou Sakho is likely to be fined after he stormed out of Anfield having been dropped from Liverpool’s 18-man squad.
