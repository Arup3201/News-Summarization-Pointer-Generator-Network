For more than three-quarters of a century, a four-fingered  chocolate bar meant you were eating a KitKat.

But shoppers could now be offered an alternative after a legal battle over whether the shape of the snack is a trademark.

Nestlé wanted to register the four-finger KitKat design in a bid that was resisted by Cadbury.

Iconic design: But Nestle has lost an attempt to trademark the four-fingered shape in the UK

However the Intellectual Property Office ruled against the Swiss firm on the grounds that consumers identified KitKats primarily by their bright red packaging.

It said the reason the chocolate-covered wafers were divided into fingers was to make them easier to break up and eat, making it a technical issue, rather than one of branding.

Furthermore, the ruling pointed out that the four-finger shape was covered up by the wrapper so any imitator would not confuse consumers.

This means Cadbury or another competitor could introduce a rival to the KitKat, first made as the Rowntree’s Chocolate Crisp in 1935.

But the ruling is complicated by the fact that Nestlé does have protection for the four-finger design at European level after defeating another challenge by Cadbury.

A Nestlé spokesman said the firm was considering whether to appeal against the IPO decision.

Rival firm Cadbury, maker of Dairy Milk, said it welcomed the ruling by the Intellectual Property Office

He said: ‘KitKat was launched over 75 years ago and is one of the most iconic shapes of any chocolate bar, recognised around the world.

'In December last year, Nestlé won a EU ruling on the validity of their EU wide trademark registration for the four-finger KitKat shape so we are perplexed and disappointed with this national decision by the UK Intellectual Property Office.’

‘The UK is the birthplace of KitKat and we are assessing whether to appeal.’

Mondelez International, the new name of Cadbury’s American owners, welcomed the ruling but said they had no ‘immediate’ plans to launch a similar product in the UK.

Have a break... KitKat was initially called Chocolate Crisp and was launched in London in 1935

Initially called Rowntree's Chocolate Crisp, the four-fingered wafer crisp was launched in London and the South East in September 1935.

Renamed KitKat Chocolate Crisp two years later, it became KitKat after the Second World War.  Noone is sure where the name KitKat came from, but its thought London's famous KitCat (aka KitKat) Club of the 1920s may have been an influence.

Within two years of launch, KitKat was Rowntree's leading product, a position that has remained unchanged.

During the Second World War it was marketed as a valuable wartime food with the slogan 'What Active People Need'.

KitKats
have been produced in a red and white wrapper for most of their history
apart from a brief spell from 1945-47 when it was covered in plain 
rather than milk chocolate because of a shortage of milk after the war -
it then came in a blue wrapper.

It was first advertised on television in 1957 and the famous 'dancing panda' advertisement came 30 years later in 1987, followed by the 'Have a break' series of advertisements in the 1990s.

The two-fingered KitKat was launched at the same time as the four-fingered one, and the KitKat Chunky was launched in 1999.
