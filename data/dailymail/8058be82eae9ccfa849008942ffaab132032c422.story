Footage of a vicious fight at a Perth train station on Monday afternoon has appeared online 

The three brawlers - one wearing all black, one in blue shorts and one in a white singlet started swinging punches at each other grabbing each others' clothes while legs and arms going flailing everywhere.

Uploaded to Facebook on Monday the video has had over 131,000 views since then, with 3000 people liking it and hundreds more commenting on the fight.

Station staff are very quick to respond to the commotion, with two men jumping in initially, managing to restrain the boy in the blue shorts while the two others continue to rumble.

Two more guards quickly arrive on the scene shortly after as the man wearing all black pins the one in white to the floor pounding him with punches.

 A female staff member then jumps into the mix along with two other colleagues and she and another man pull one boy out of the fight while two other guards tackle the final member of the trio.

'It is gratifying to see the speed and efficiency of the transit officers in responding and putting a stop to the fighting,' Perth Public Transport Authority spokesman David Hynes told Daily Mail Australia in a statement.

'Had this occurred elsewhere, for example at a shopping centre or in the street, it is unlikely that it would have been resolved anywhere near as quickly.

'This is a graphic reminder of the PTA’s zero tolerance approach to anti-social behaviour on our network,' Mr Hynes said.
