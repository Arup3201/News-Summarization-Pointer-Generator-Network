Samuel Eto'o has labelled Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho a 'puppet' and again hit out at his detractors regarding his age.

The 33-year-old Cameroon striker made the reference to Mourinho after previously describing his boss as a 'fool' in comments which are almost certain to signal his departure from Stamford Bridge.

Eto'o told the Confederation of African Football website: 'Contrary to what a puppet says about my age, I am still physically fit.

'At 33, I feel real good. I have proven that I could do better than youths.'

Mourinho was caught on camera making unguarded comments suggesting Eto'o was older than his official age earlier this season.

Eto'o, who scored 12 times for Chelsea, celebrated his next goal by mimicking a geriatric and repeated his aim is to continue playing at the top level in Europe.

'And I wish to also say that I am not going to the United States or to the Middle East,' said Eto'o, who is out of contract at Stamford Bridge following a season-long deal after leaving Anzhi Makhachkala.

'I will continue at the top level. I will continue to play the Champions League.

'My romance with this competition is far from over.

'I will not tell you where, but I will be at the top level. I am 33 and I have two World Cups to play.

'Before me there are other players who went on until the age of 41. So I can continue.'
