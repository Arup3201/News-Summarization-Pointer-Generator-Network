He may be known for his love of fast cars but Jeremy Clarkson's childhood home has just one garage.

Home Farm, in the village of Burghwallis near Doncaster, South Yorkshire, was lived in by the Clarkson family during the 1970s.

More than 200 miles away from the Top Gear track in Surrey, picturesque Burghwallis is known for its peaceful countryside and farmland.

The house, on the market through estate agents Jackson-Stops in York, is now up for sale for more than half a million.

On the agents' website, it is described as 'the home of Paddington bear' - but no mention is made of Mr Clarkson.

The grade II listed building, spread across four floors, has four double bedrooms, two reception rooms, three bathrooms, an entrance hall and a cellar.

Its price tag is £595,000 - more than three times the cost of the average British home.

But although a long gravel driveway leads up to the 16th century property, its garage is no place for a supercar.

Measuring 21ft by 12ft (6.4m by 3.7m) the property's garage is only slightly bigger than the master bedroom.

While the Top Gear presenter spent his formative years there, his mother Shirley Clarkson (pictured) launched her career making Paddington Bear toys in the house

The property is located near two racecourses: Pontefract and Doncaster. It is also close to Headingley cricket ground where the England team often plays national games

Behind its mustard facade, the lounge is decked out with wooden beams and warmed by a large stone fireplace. The flooring is made out of locally-sourced York flagstones.

The house has also been granted planning permission for a tennis court.

As well as stunning views of the Yorkshire countryside the property is located close to two racecourses: Pontefract and Doncaster.

It is also just 28 miles from Headingley cricket ground where the England team plays national games.

The house has four bedrooms, an office and loft storage as well as three bathrooms. The property also has planning permission for a tennis court

This quirky office located in the attic has a skylight and stunning curved wooden ceilings

But despite its former celebrity tenant, the house, which has been up for sale since November 2011, has not yet received any offers. 

While the Top Gear presenter spent his formative years there, his mother Shirley Clarkson launched her career making Paddington Bear toys.

She first made the cuddly toys as Christmas presents for Mr Clarkson and his sister Joanna in the Christmas of 1971 when Mr Clarkson was just 10 years old.

They were so popular with Joanna and her friends that Mrs Clarkson went on to make thousands of the marmalade-loving teddies - many of which were lovingly hand-stitched in Home Farm's kitchen.

Mrs Clarkson even agreed royalties with Paddington Bear's creator Michael Bond.

They are now sold in shops all over the world from John Lewis to Argos.
