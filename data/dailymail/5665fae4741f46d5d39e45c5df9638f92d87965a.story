A high school cheerleader whose dad secretly filmed her in her bedroom and the bathroom has revealed that she has forgiven him - and even encouraged her mother not to file for a divorce.

Michaela Smith, from Pell City, Alabama, was just 15 when she saw a red flashing light between her trophies in her bedroom in April 2011 and realized it was a camera.

Investigations revealed that her father, Michael Smith, had filmed her on four separate occasions and stashed the images on his computer. He was jailed for a year.

Now Michaela, who is 18, has spoken out as she receives the Bryant-Jordan Student-Athlete Achievement Award, which honors student-athletes who have overcome hardship, on Monday.

Ordeal: Michaela Smith, a high school cheerleader in Alabama, has said she forgives her father for recording her in her bedroom and in the bathroom - a crime that saw him locked up for a year

Even though she was initially distraught that her father had recorded her, she said she has since learned to forgive him because the experience has allowed her to help other victims.

'I lost my innocence that day,' Michaela, who does not believe in sex before marriage, told AL.com. 'I realize it was horrible but it was a necessary price 
in order to help my father and to use this experience to help others. That sacrifice has created positive changes in so many other people.'

Now that he has been in prison, he realizes what he has done wrong, she said.

'Sometimes it takes hitting rock bottom 
for us to make a change and that is what happened to my father,' she 
said. 'I am so thankful for the year he spent in prison because it truly
 saved his life.'

Michaela also described her horror when she changed from her church clothes into a more comfortable t-shirt - and saw the camera flashing.

Her mother was also in the room and said she immediately feared the worst, but tried to cover up her bad thoughts, for Michaela's sake.

Support: Her mother Rhonda, left, walked out on her father when they discovered he had been filming Michaela, but she has not divorced him and they still attend the same church

'I said something like I put it up there while I was cleaning and didn't know how to shut it off,' Rhonda said. 'I didn't want to worry her.'

But she told her other daughter, Janet, who asked a friend adept at computer forensics for help and pictures of Michaela were later found on her father's computer.

He was arrested in April 2011 and indicted the following November.

'This man was supposed to protect me from all the bad in the world,' Michaela said. 'He put that camera in my room and had been using it to look at me for months. I've never felt so destroyed.'

Ahead of the incident - when her mother was struggling to cope with her father's drinking - Michaela had told her mother that she didn't want her to get a divorce.

'Families are supposed to stick together,' she said. 'Marriages are not easy. A man and wife should stay together. They made a promise to God. There is always counseling and help if things get bad.'

But her mother wishes she had stayed with her gut instinct and divorced him. Still, she remains married to him and they attend the same church.

Forgiving: Michaela said that she realizes her father had hit rock bottom and is aware of how much he hurt their family. She said she is thankful for the incident because it has allowed her to help other victims

Moving on: Michaela, pictured with fellow cheerleaders, missed a lot of school amid the stress of the case but has maintained a solid GPA and now hopes to attend Auburn following her senior year

Michaela said she never blamed her mother for staying with her father, calling her 'the best thing in my world'.

As the case dragged on, Michaela struggled to eat or sleep and rarely attended school. Her father had been bailed out by wealthy relatives, and she lived in fear she would see him.

After her father was sentenced, she started therapy and realized that she could take her bad experiences and use them to help others at church groups, youth groups and after school.

Her father was released from prison last March but if he tries to speak with her, he will be sent back. This arrangement could change with Michaela's consent - but she said she is not ready yet.

He told AL.com that he had long struggled with an addicted to pornography and regretted how it had destroyed his family. He said he had not watched it since his wife and daughter left him three years ago.

His daughter said she is now looking forward to attending Auburn and perhaps studying social work.
