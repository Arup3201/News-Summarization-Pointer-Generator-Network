You might think that people attending Wimbledon Tennis Championships are there for the tennis, but a new survey suggests that only a quarter of UK fans are keen to get the best seat to watch the tournament.

Apparently having a glass or two of Pimms or Champagne or just saying ‘I was there’ are good enough reasons – and sometimes the best aspects – of making a trip to Wimbledon.

Londoners place the most importance on the quality of their seat compared to other regions, with 36 per cent saying having a great view of tennis was their top priority.

However, fans from Yorkshire and the Humber value this the least (16 per cent), according to ticket resale marketplace StubHub.

Wimbledon goers from the South West rank soaking up the atmosphere in the ground the higher than anywhere else in the country (32 per cent), while when it comes to being able to say ‘I was there’, Scottish fans list this first (24 per cent).

As for food and drink, the North East comfortably outstrips the rest of the UK, with 14 per cent of people listing having a glass or two of Champagne or Pimms as the most exciting aspect of a trip to Wimbledon, in comparison to only 3 per cent of those in the South East and South West.

StubHub general manager international Brigitte Ricou-Bellan said: ‘Wimbledon is such a unique annual event that it is more than simply sport.

‘These findings illustrate how much people treat a trip to Wimbledon as not just a chance to watch tennis but to extend the fan experience and joining in with all the British traditions that the Championships have to offer.’
