The court case into pro-gun police Chief Mark Kessler, whose foul-mouthed online rants about gun rights got him fired, has been adjourned after a loaded gun fell from one of his supporter's holsters during the hearing.

The handgun did not fire during the hearing yesterday but officials decided that the hearing would be adjourned until a later date.

Mark Kessler had already been suspended for 30 days for posting the profanity-laced pro-gun videos.

'Libtards': Mark Kessler used vile language in Internet tirades about gun rights

Tough guy: Kessler invites the 'libtards' to 'come and get it,' referring to his guns

Now Gilberton Borough Council, in Pennsylvania, has voted to sack him from his role in the community, The Morning Call reported.

Some
of the charges against him are that Kessler didn't fill out 
government-mandated crime data forms; used a law enforcement discount to
get tyres on his personal vehicle; failed to turn over borough weapons 
upon request; destroyed borough property; and was insubordinate by 
disparaging council members.

Kessler
has acknowledged that his videos are inflammatory, but he told NBC News
they were designed to draw attention to what he sees as the erosion of 
the USA's Second Amendment and the freedom of speech.

As
the court heard witness statements a bystander, standing directly 
behind Kessle, dropped his handgun, and the meeting was stopped.

The gun was dropped by a man wearing a T-shirt with the initials for the Constitutional Security Force, Kessler's group.

Supporters: Kessler leaves City Hall and is met by supporters - some of whom encouraged him to run for president

In September he said it was his 'right' and 
'freedom' to make the videos, in which he repeatedly fires the 
borough-owned automatic weapon. He told NBC Philadelphia after
being fired: 'I feel in my heart I'm doing the right thing.'

Several
Kessler supporters have showed up at hearings dealing with his termination, and most were 
members of his 'Constitution Security Force' - his pro-gun group.

In an earlier hearing in September, 
Kessler's lawyer, Joseph Nahas, claimed the charges brought against his 
client were inflated to justify his dismissal for the videos, said NBC 
News.

In one video, he 
claims to be apologising for using offensive language in a previous 
video. He then says he's kidding, tells people who were offended to 'go 
f*** yourself' and then fires founds from a machine gun.

In
another video, he complains about Secretary of State John Kerry, the 
United Nations and other 'libtards' and 'p******' he claims are trying 
to take his guns.

After firing more rounds from a machine gun, he invites the 'libtards' to 'come and get it.'

Armed: supporters of Kessler's showed up to City Hall armed as the council voted to suspend him for 30 days

Kessler
was suspended in July for improper use of state purchasing programme, 
failing to submit required crime data and making derogatory comments 
about borough officials.

After the hearing Nahas declined the offer to comment, NBC News said.

When
the videos first surfaced last month, Gilberton Mayor Hannon 
said she found the language in the videos offensive and she understood 
that others did as well.

'I think it's blackened our eye a little, but we are a strong community,' Hannon said at the time. 'We will go on from here.'

Officials
have said that Kessler bought the weapons with his own money and 
donated them to the police department, an action approved by the 
council. Kessler told PennLive.com on Wednesday that he also donated the
ammunition used in the videos.
