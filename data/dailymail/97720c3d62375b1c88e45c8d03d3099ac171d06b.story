How often do you lie - even to yourself - on Facebook, Twiitter or Instagram?

Perhaps online you're in a 'complicated' relationship, but in reality you're all on your tod. Maybe you're spending Saturday night at home alone with a box of Maltesers when all your eFriends think you're 'in the pub with the girls'. Or are you posting photos of a beach in Barbados, when really you're repainting the shed in Croydon?

A third of women admit being dishonest at least once a month on social networking sites, according to research. But a new 'anti-social' networking forum, Pencourage.com, is hoping to bring an end to this world of made-up make-believe, enabling users to post anonymously and be as honest as they would in a personal diary.

Pencourage.com allows users to post completely anonymously and without the fear of online friends judging them

Pencourage - subtitled online with 'imagine if you could read other people's thoughts?' - was launched to bridge the gap between what people say (on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) and what they really think.

Describing the site as 'as real as it gets', founders say the idea is that people journal 'every aspect of their lives, as it really is'.

Users predominantly take to the site to have a much-needed moan about life, relationships, work, personal struggles and financial stresses, and other writers then impart words of advice and encouragement.

Since the new online platform went live two months ago,
 over 3,000 people have signed up and nearly 4,000 entries have been 
posted.

Primarily written by women (core demographic has been tracked as
 female, ages 32-45), the site's anonymous disclosures provide a raw, 
unfiltered snapshot of thoughts that would never see the light of day on
 personal blogs, Facebook or even Twitter.

This is also giving the 
ongoing diaries an addictive, voyeuristic quality - site viewers spend an average 
12 minutes every time they visit, checking in regularly to see what's 
been happening with the people they 'follow'.

Pencourage enables people to write as if penning a personal diary, and be as miserable and honest as they like

Recent heartfelt posts include messages about depression, breaking up with a partner, losing jobs, bullying and guilt.

According to one leading psychologist the pressure to stay connected on social media can paradoxically leave us more isolated. Pencourage enables people to be truly honest about the way they are feeling.

Dr Michael Sinclair, 
Consultant Counselling Psychology and Clinical Director at City Psychology 
Group said: 'The popularity of this new social media site is not surprising at all. 
We work very hard presenting ourselves to the world online, pretending 
and attempting to be happy all the time which is exhausting and 
ultimately unfulfilling.

'Omitting the less desirable imperfections of 
our lives from the conversations with our "friends" online leads to less
 opportunity to feel empathised with - resulting in a greater sense of 
disconnection from others.'

Pencourage allows people to be completely honest with the world and themselves

A recent survey by OnePoll into lying online revealed that 33 per cent of women are dishonest on social networking sites at least once a month.

The most common things respondents lied or exaggerated about were what they are doing at the moment, how much they drink, where they are on holiday, how successful they are and their relationship status.

The top reasons given for lying were worrying that others see you as boring, feeling jealous of others' exciting posts, having nothing else to say and wanting to impress someone.
