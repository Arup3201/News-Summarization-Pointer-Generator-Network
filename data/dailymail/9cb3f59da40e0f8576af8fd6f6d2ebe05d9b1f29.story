The collapse of the Easter Island's civilisation is often used as a cautionary tale to show the folly of humans who overexploit their surroundings, but scientists have now discovered what allowed the ancient inhabitants to flourish in the first place.

Tiny plant fossils preserved in the dental plaque on teeth found among human remains on the remote Pacific island have revealed what the doomed civilisation ate - sweet potato.

Scientists found starch grains from the popular tuber embedded in the hardened plaque from a selection of teeth from inhabitants of the island between the 14th and end of the 19th century.

They claim that the starchy, sweet tasting vegetable formed the predominant part of the islander's diet and was also a major source of water for them.

They believe the original Polynesian settlers brought the vegetable with them when they first arrived on Easter Island, or Rapa Nui as it is also known, sometime before the 1200 AD.

Despite living on a remote dot of land in the middle of the Pacific Ocean with only their enigmatic stone figures for company, the ancient Polynesian people who populated Easter Island may not have been as isolated as has long been believed.

A recent genetic study published in the journal Current Biology found that these ancient people had significant contact with Native American populations hundreds of years before Dutch explorers first reached the island in 1722.

Genetic data on 27 Easter Island natives indicated that interbreeding between the Rapa Nui and native people in South America occurred roughly between 1300 and 1500.

The genetic evidence indicates either that Rapa Nui people traveled to South America or that Native Americans journeyed to Easter Island. The researchers said it probably was the Rapa Nuipeople making the arduous ocean round trips. 

'We found evidence of gene flow between this population and
Native American populations, suggesting an ancient ocean
migration route between Polynesia and the Americas,' said
geneticist Anna-Sapfo Malaspinas of the Centre for GeoGenetics
at the University of Copenhagen, who led the study.  

However, the study may also help to explain what led to the ultimate downfall of the civilisation that once flourished on Easter Island.

It is thought that the flourishing Rapa Nui civilisation, which numbered more than 15,000 at its peak, destroyed the trees that covered the island, leading to wars over dwindling resources.

Grains of silica from the palm trees that were once common over the island were found in the dental plaque of the ancient inhabitants, leading to claims that they had used them for food.

However, the latest research shows no sign of starch from palm trees on the teeth and that the palm fossils can actually become incorporated into the skin of sweet potatoes grown on the same ground.

This suggests that as the population grew, the islanders cut down some of the palm forest to create land where they could grow their crops of sweet potatoes.

Monica Tromp, an anatomist at the University of Otago in New Zealand who conducted the work, said: 'By about AD 1500 the palm forest that covered most of the island was eradicated.

'The historic and modern aspect of the landscape is one of low-lying grasses, sedges and invasive shrubs, leaving no visible evidence of the extinct palm thought to have been dominant.

'The consistency of microfossils recovered from the dental calculus suggest that the plant component of the Rapa Nui diet probably did not change much through time.

'This would be expected as cultivation strategies of the sweet potato crops in the marginal Rapa Nui environment were refined over time.

'Sweet potato does not require processing or cooking before eating, and indeed was probably eaten raw as a source of both carbohydrates and water.' 

Easter Island is one of the most remote inhabited island in the world, more than 2,180 miles away from the coast of Chile and 1,289 miles from the nearest inhabited island. 

Cultivation of sweet potato  may have given the inhabitants on Easter Island time to carve the distinctive stone moai heads that are the only visible signs left on the landscape of the once flourishing civilisation

Yet it is thought that shortly before 1200 AD, Polynesians sailed to the island and began to settle there, although some experts put the arrival of the first settlers as early as 800 AD.

The population on the island grew quickly as settlements were formed, thriving for hundreds of years.

Some experts believe the fertile land allowed the population time to develop a rich culture and gave them time to carve the distinctive moai stone heads that the island is now famous for.

However, the destruction of the palm forests that covered the island led to much of the fertile soil washing away while the introduction of pests like the Pacific rat also damaged the natural wildlife.

It was thought that the trees were cut down to provide fuel and building material for the inhabitants.

But the latest findings, which are published in the Journal of Archaeological Science, suggest that they may have also been removed to make room for agricultural land for growing sweet potato.

By the time the first European explorers discovered the island in 1722, the population had dropped from around 15,000 to between 2,000 and 3,000 and the land was almost barren.

Starvation and war over the remaining resources are thought to have devastated the once stable civilisation and led to some of the famous stone heads being toppled. 

Grains of starch from sweet potato were found in the ancient dental plaque of teeth found on Easter Island

Easter Island now boasts a population of around 5,000 but by the time the second expedition of European explorers arrived at the island in 1877, its population had almost completely died out

Disease and slave raiding during the 19th century further reduced the population of the island to just over 100 by 1877.

Miss Tromp and her colleague Dr John Dudgeon from Idaho State University, studied 30 human teeth from the remains of 26 individuals found at archaeological sites around the island.

Embedded within the hardened dental plaque, also called dental calculus, were microscopic fossils from plants.

Initial work looking at these found the vast majority were microfossils, or phytoliths, from a species of palm tree (Paschalococos disperta) that went extinct shortly after the Polynesian's arrival.

However, further analysis also found starch grains that matched those from modern sweet potatoes.

The researchers also tested modern sweet potatoes grown in sediment similar to that of Easter Island and found that as the tubers grow, their skins incorporate palm phyotliths from the soil.

Miss Tromp said that it seemed likely that the sweet potatoes were brought to Easter Island by the first Polynesian settlers.

She said: 'The sweet potato starch grains were found on almost all of the teeth we looked at and so we think this is evidence that they had the sweet potato with them when the Polynesian settlers colonised the Island. It was not indigenous.

'We found palm phytoliths in a much larger quantity than the starch grains, which does support that there was once a large quantity of palm trees on Easter Island in the past.

'Phytoliths are usually found in every part of palm trees and so when they die their phytoliths are left behind in the soil indefinitely. 

'This does not necessarily mean that our research supports the conclusion that they were destroyed by humans - although there is other research that does support that conclusion.'

The scientists found that microfossils from palm trees can become incorporated into the skins of sweet potato, suggesting that the vegetables were grown in soil that had been cleared of palm trees

Dr Dudgeon, an anthropologist at Idaho State University who led the work, said that the team were now analysing DNA recovered from the dental plaque to see if they can identify animal proteins. They have also been able to recover some plant chloroplast DNA but have yet to match it to a species.

He said that the work may lead to new theories about what led to the demise of the civilisation on Easter Island.

He said: 'Rapa Nui is a profound example of human persistence on a very marginal island, and that through selective use of plants and animals - sweet potatoes and Polynesian rats - that were well-adapted to the rather cold, nontropical environment on Rapa Nui they arrived at an adequate solution to exist there until the first documented European arrival on Easter Sunday, 1722.

'Other island populations in the remote eastern Pacific - Rapa Iti - do not persist until European arrival. 

'It is my opinion that sweet potatoes are not implicated in the demise of the island’s native palm; rather, the normal and sustained use of the parts of this tree, coupled with the loss of the germinative seeds or nuts of this tree from the Polynesian rat predation is the more likely cause of the trees’ extinction. 

'Forest clearance activities may have had some effect on the sheer number of trees on the island, but I am not convinced that agricultural activities are the prime cause of forest extirpation on Rapa Nui.'
