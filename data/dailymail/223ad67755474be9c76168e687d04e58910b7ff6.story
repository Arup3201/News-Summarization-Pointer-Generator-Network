The seven-month-old Staffordshire terrier was missing for 24 days and travelled 700km in the Australian outback before she was found and reunited with her owner through Facebook

A seven-month old Staffordshire terrier puppy has been reunited with her owner after an epic 700km (434 mile) journey through the Australian outback.

The adventurous puppy, Malibue, went missing from her owner’s home in Alice Springs, in the Northern Territory, Australia on February 4.

After a 24-day journey, Malibue ended up in Amata, an indigenous community in the neighbouring state of South Australia, 700km from her home.

She was found on February 28, largely thanks to a Facebook campaign, which saw dozens of people sharing the photo of the missing dog.

Malibue was reunited with her owner, Benton Chamber on Tuesday. He was overjoyed to see his ‘best friend’ again and believes she might have had some help with her escapade, perhaps hitching a ride in a stranger’s car.

‘She just goes with the flow - it's a good trait that she just bounces off things, shakes it off,’ he told the ABC.

‘But it's also a bad thing, just jumping in people's cars. I don't think she realises what she's done.’

Mr Chambers thanked the police and his family and ‘everyone who contributed… it’s just awesome work getting my little fleabag back.’

The good news story has been one of the Northern Territory Police’s most popular stories on social media, with more than 1,800 likes and almost 400 people sharing the dog’s photo.

‘It certainly touched a nerve,’ said Jason Gates the media liaison for the Northern Territory Police.

He added that missing dogs were not strictly police business, but they were happy to help.

‘It’s not something we do as a rule, but if we’re in the area and can assist, we’re happy to.’
