Diego Costa has called on the world of football to help put an end to discrimination, just hours after footage emerged of Chelsea fans in Paris refusing to let a black passenger on to a Metro train.

The menacing Blues striker was speaking ahead of Chelsea's annual 'Game for Equality' which takes place against Burnley on Saturday and he has urged people to speak out against all forms of discrimination. 

Chelsea have strongly condemned the incident which saw fans prevent a black man getting aboard by twice pushing him back on to the platform before subjecting him to vile chants ahead of the west London club's Champions League clash against Paris Saint-Germain.

Although Costa's comments would have been recorded before the incident on Tuesday night, the Spain international's views come at an important time for the club as they work with police to investigate the culprits of the shameful incident. 

He told Chelsea's official website: 'It’s a delicate issue, not just racism, but discrimination as a whole. 

'It doesn’t matter about your social status or whether you have good or bad financial conditions.

Costa's comment were released on the same day that footage emerged of a black passenger attempts to board  but is refused entry by supporters  travelling to the Champions League tie in Paris

'It’s important we put a lot of work into it because the more people speak about these issues, the more chance there is of it getting out into the public domain.

'People that suffer from discrimination shouldn’t stay quiet, because speaking about it will help them become stronger.'

Chelsea have appealed for witnesses regarding the incident on the Metro and also of a separate one outside the stadium which saw a number of Blues fans affected by CS spray.

A Chelsea statement said: 'Chelsea Football Club is aware of an incident in Paris last night (Tuesday) when a number of our supporters were affected by CS spray outside the Parc des Princes before kick-off.

'We are emailing fans who purchased tickets directly from the club asking for witness accounts of the incident.'
