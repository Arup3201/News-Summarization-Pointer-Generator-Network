There has always been a great rivalry between these sides, but I never played at Old Trafford with any fear. 

I went there as a youngster in 1986 and won with Arsenal and during the Arsene Wenger years we had a team that could go and win anywhere.

We were a physical team but we could play, and it was almost a compliment when United tried to match our physicality.

Arsenal defender Martin Keown confront Ruud van Nistelrooy following his missed penalty in 2003 

Keown and his Arsenal team-mates taunted the Dutchman following his last-minute spot-kick miss 

Keown's confrontation with Van Nistelrooy was the final act in what is now known as the 'Battle of Old Trafford' 

In 1999, Ryan Giggs scored that classic FA Cup goal and it turned the season. Arsenal could have won the double but United went on to win the treble. Andy Cole made a run to drag me out of position, but sometimes you just have to admire moments of genius.

The other game people love to remind me of is the ‘Battle of Old Trafford’ in 2003. In the little black book of opposition players, Ruud van Nistelrooy was one not to be trusted. 

He was a top player and a fighter, but he would look for any reason to go down. 

Perhaps I overreacted, but the whole team was infuriated by him. And I’m still not convinced I deserved to give away the penalty that Ruud eventually missed!

Keown was part of a physical side that felt they could win anywhere under Arsene Wenger
