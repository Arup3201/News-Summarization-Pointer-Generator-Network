Response: Supt Kevin Purcell (pictured) apologised to motorists. But his colleague attacked 'vile' drivers on Twitter for encouraging the man to jump while they waited in a queue

A senior policeman has condemned ‘vile’ trolls who took to social networking sites to complain about a motorway being closed for 24 hours because of a man threatening to throw himself from a bridge.

Police closed the M42 in both directions at Junction 1 near Bromsgrove in the West Midlands  at 12.45pm on Saturday. They finally talked the man  down at 3pm yesterday.

Specialist negotiators could be seen talking to the man – who was standing at railings on the A38 road bridge over the motorway.

Thousands of drivers were stuck in queues for several hours on Saturday as police closed the busy motorway in both directions between the M5 and Junction 2 of the M42.

But despite diversions and appeals for motorists to avoid the area, roads remained clogged with traffic.

Some
 irate drivers vented their anger on Twitter and Facebook labelling the 
man's actions as 'selfish' and encouraging him to jump.

But many others expressed their concern for the man and their own disgust at some of the abusive messages being posted online.

Yesterday before the man got
 down, Assistant Chief Constable Gareth Morgan took to Twitter to 
criticise those mocking the individual.

‘Unfortunately for travellers M42 is still closed,’ he tweeted.

‘The intolerant, hateful and “Don’t you know what you’re doing” brigade should be ashamed.

Tailbacks: Police closed the M42 between the M5 and junction 1 which caused huge traffic jams

'No shortage of armchairs or experts to fill them giving advice and or being vile about people/things they know nothing about.’

Superintendent Kevin Purcell, policing
 commander for North Worcestershire, had apologised to drivers for the 
traffic tailbacks but insisted there was no alternative but to close the
 motorway.

He said: 'I 
would like to apologise to all motorists and local people who have 
experienced significant disruption as a result of this incident.

Big incident: Specialist police negotiators were sent to talk the man while other officers cordoned off the road

'Clearly we strive to resolve such matters as quickly as possible, but I would like to make it clear that the threat of harm both to the individual concerned and to vehicles driving on the M42 is so significant, that there was no alternative but to close the motorway and for it to remain closed until the incident has run its course.

'Once again I apologise for any 
inconvenience caused and would thank members of the public and local 
community for their patience and understanding.

'We are doing all we can to resolve the situation as quickly as possible and are following national guidelines.

Traffic chaos: The incident had already started to cause long tailbacks on the M42 on Saturday evening

'Our number one priority is the protection of life.'

Samaritans charity, who provide support for people battling emotional distress, urged those affected to contact them.

A spokesman said: 'Anyone that is affected by the on-going incident on the M42 we're always open and we encourage people to get in touch.'
