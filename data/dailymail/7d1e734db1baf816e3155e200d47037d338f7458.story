Britain has fallen short of the best countries in the world in an international league table measuring the wellbeing of the elderly.

It ranked the UK 13th – one place below Ireland – for the levels of income, health and employment of older people.

The table, drawn up by academics for the charity HelpAge International, showed the top three were Sweden, Norway and Germany.

While Britain is not one of the very best countries in which to grow old, however, the elderly here fare better than in some parts of Europe.

Spain, Belgium and Italy are all listed outside the top 20, below poorer nations such as Chile and Slovenia. France is placed only 18th.

Poland, an EU member for more than 15 years, is ranked at 62, below Venezuela, El Salvador, Vietnam and the Philippines.

HelpAge International, which is based in London but operates mainly in developing countries, commissioned academics from several universities to compile the Global AgeWatch Index, the first of its kind.

They considered measures including pensions, poverty rates, life expectancy, levels of employment and education, and whether old people are physically safe and have friends.

Britain’s 13th place is based on a good ranking for pensions and benefits such as pension credit.

However, the report suggests that healthcare for the elderly in the UK is not up to the best standards. It points to life-expectancy estimates that show babies born here now can expect four years less life than might be expected. It also shows that those who make it to the age of 60 in Japan can expect to live to 86 – three years longer than in Britain.

The three lowest-ranked countries of the 91 that could provide enough data about the welfare of their elderly population were Afghanistan, Tanzania and Pakistan.

Standards: The survey said the elderly Britain had good pensions and benefits but the levels of healthcare could be improved (file picture)
