Robin van Persie scored both goals in Manchester United's 2-1 win at Southampton on Monday night, but the game's statistics at St Mary's make for alarming reading for Louis van Gaal's side.

United were poor for large patches of the match and this was highlighted by the fact they only managed to muster three shots throughout - and all from the left-foot of Van Persie.

The trio of strikes from the Dutchman is the lowest recorded by the Red Devils in any Premier League game since August 2003, as well as by any side in England's top flight this season.

Under Van Gaal it seems United are still searching for the right tactic to employ as the club’s crippling injury list continues to force the 63-year-old's hand when it comes to picking his strongest XI.

The inconsistency in his team selection is clearly hampering the attacking flow of his charges and this was exemplified by the fact the Red Devils only had six touches in the opposing penalty box over the course of the 90 minutes - 26 fewer than the Saints.

What's perhaps more surprising is the fact that Radamel Falcao - a striker who cost United £6million to bring to Old Trafford for a season on loan and who they would need to stump up another £40m to sign next summer - remained firmly on the bench despite the lack of firepower up front.

United boss Van Gaal said before the match that Falcao can 'only play for 20 minutes' due to a lack of 'match fitness', and clearly he decided the Colombian could not be risked at St Mary's. And this despite the fact Falcao's wife Lorelei Taron posted on her Instagram account a picture of the striker training with the caption: '100% ready to give everything !!!'.

Van Gaal's counterpart Ronald Koeman was flabbergasted at how his side lost the match, but was quick to acknowledge the predatory instincts of Van Persie.

But Louis van Gaal's side registered the fewest number of efforts on goal in the Premier League this season

The 31-year-old's second saw him register his seventh goal in as many games against the south coast outfit and took his career tally to 140 Premier League  strikes - making him the 10th player in history to achieve the feat.

Despite United's fortuitous win, the three points move the Old Trafford club to third in the Premier League as they recorded five league victories in a row for the first time since winning seven on the spin in March 2013.

That year, United won the title. Although they are a long way from achieving that feat this campaign, Van Gaal won’t care if his side can continue their run by merit or by fortune.
