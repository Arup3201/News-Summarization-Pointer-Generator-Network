After sealing the signings of Ander Herrera and Luke Shaw this week, Manchester United are now considering a move for Juventus midfielder Arturo Vidal.

The Chilean international is an authoritative central midfield player and Sportsmail understands that United have made tentative enquiries to establish whether a move will be feasible this summer.

Louis van Gaal is keen to add goals to the United midfield and Vidal scored eighteen for the Italian side last season and thirteen during the previous campaign.

Sportsmail understands that Van Gaal 
previously attempted to sign Vidal for Bayern Munich when the player was
 at Bayer Leverkusen several years ago.

It is believed that Juventus are determined to keep hold of the  27-year-old and United were previously knocked back when they enquired about the Chilean’s availability when David Moyes was at Old Trafford.

Nonetheless, United’s intention this summer to build a squad capable of winning the Barclays Premier League and Van Gaal will be backed in the transfer market to ensure that he is provided with the best possible opportunity of doing so.

And United may feel that a bid in excess of £30 million could force Juventus to alter their position.

The club will continue to monitor any developments once Vidal returns from the World Cup and will move in if they receive encouragement from the player or the Italian club in the coming weeks.

The Old Trafford club are also maintaining an interest in Roma’s Kevin Strootman and Vidal’s Juventus team-mate Paul Pogba, although the Frenchman would command a fee in excess of £55 million.

Van Gaal will also step up his pursuit of Arsenal defender Thomas Vermaelen following the World Cup.

A wage package is understood to have been agreed in principle and the player’s camp remain confident that a move will go through, although United may have to stump up £11 million to prise the 28-year-old away from the North London club.
