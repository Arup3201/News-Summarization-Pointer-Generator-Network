Newcastle fans and Alan Pardew could be forgiven for wishing Gus Poyet to be prised away from Sunderland and land a job abroad.

For the Uruguayan has long since been the nemesis of the Magpies and their manager.

He scored six times against United as a player, including a match-winning double in an FA Cup semi-final for Chelsea, and is unbeaten in six versus Pardew, including last season’s Tyne-Wear derby double.

And Poyet says: ‘As a player, I have no explanation for it. I did not prepare differently, I was just lucky enough to be in positions to score and make the difference.

‘The first time I was man-marked in England was against Newcastle at St James' Park when Bobby Robson was the manager, and I was with Tottenham. It felt strange, because I didn't think I was a player to be man-marked! 

‘But, because I always scored against them, they decided to do it – but I scored anyway. So something was happening for some reason.

‘Every time I went into the box I found the ball was there, every time I made a run the ball was there.

‘Then, of course, it was probably influenced by the semi-final when I scored two goals at Wembley.’

Poyet enjoyed two FA Cup victories over Newcastle and Pardew as manager of Brighton, and he adds: ‘They were special games. It is funny because when you are the Championship side you are just trying to beat the top team – it was the same against Sunderland, because we beat them in the cup, too.

‘Things happen in football that there is no way to explain. But it's not about me and Alan, it is about Newcastle players and Sunderland players.

‘We can pick the team but I don't think that we can be so incredible at picking a unique team to go and mastermind a win. No.

‘I'm trying not to make it about me and Alan Pardew. It's two clubs, two cities – it's big enough.’
