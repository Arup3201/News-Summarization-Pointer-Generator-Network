A 'gay robot' was among activists who heckled Republican presidential candidate Michelle Bachmann at a campaign stop in Iowa yesterday.

Police were called in to control the disorder as Ms Bachmann stopped to meet supporters at the Hamburg Inn No.2 in Iowa City, a popular stop for presidential candidates.

About two dozen activists with Occupy Iowa City packed the diner before Bachmann arrived yesterday afternoon, then loudly chanted in unison as she tried to mingle with supporters.

Their chant blasted the Minnesota congresswoman's position on gay rights, health care and taxes and ended with: 'You're not wanted here. So go, just go.'

Among the hecklers was one man dressed as a robot, calling himself Roboprof, who shouted down Ms Bachmann with a built-in megaphone.

'I am a gay robot. I oppose Bachmann's position on gays, whether they are human or robot,' he was quoted as saying by the Iowa City Patch.

The restaurant's manager says the campaign blared Christmas songs over a sound system to drown out the protesters.

Supporters of the candidate, some of whom were later spotted by Iowa City Patch on the Bachmann campaign bus, shouted, 'We love you, Michelle,' and, 'You are our next president.'

Roboprof was eventually prevailed upon to leave the diner after a few words from Bachmann supporters.

Four police officers arrived as tensions rose, but no one was arrested. Undeterred, Ms Bachmann spent about 20 minutes in the diner shaking hands, signing autographs and posing for pictures.

Before leaving, she thanked the owner, praised the food and said it was great to be in Iowa City.

Ms Bachmann's campaign has been floundering, as front runners Newt Gingrich, Rick Perry Mitt Romney and Ron Paul pull away.

She has recently been campaigning heavily in Eastern Iowa, but a recent poll of likely Iowa caucus-goers showed she had 7.4 percent of the support, enough for fifth place.

Only Rick Santorum and Rick Perry have visited Hamburg Inn so far during their campaigns.

It has a national reputation as a stopping point for all political candidates, but Iowa City is heavily Democrat, which may have deterred this year's Republican nominees.
