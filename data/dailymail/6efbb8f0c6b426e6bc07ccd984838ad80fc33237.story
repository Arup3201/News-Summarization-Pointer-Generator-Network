After days of fielding leading questions from French journalists about drug use in the sport, British cyclist Chris Froome hit back yesterday – literally.

Needing only a solid finish in the penultimate stage of the Tour de France to cruise to victory in Paris today, Froome was forced to punch one over-eager fan who ran in front of his bike.

Kenyan-born Froome’s third-place finish yesterday gives him a 5min 3secs advantage in the 100th edition of the sport’s most famous race, and he simply needs to avoid an accident during today’s procession from Versailles to the Champs-Elysees to claim the trophy.

The Olympic time-trial bronze medallist said: ‘I can’t quite believe I’m sitting here in this position. It really is amazing.

‘I’m a bit lost for words. I’ve still got to roll into Paris but this is the general classification sorted out. To finish it off like this is special.’

Froome’s stunning achievement follows Sir Bradley Wiggins’s victory 12 months ago. It means that after a wait of 99 years for its first winner of the famous tour, Britain will soon have two in as many races.

But Froome’s efforts have been soured by comparisons with Lance Armstrong and the other cyclists who used drugs to dominate the tour in the past 20 years.

Since he powered into the lead with an emphatic victory in the first mountain stage, Froome, 28, has been forced to respond to questions about doping. He said: ‘I can understand why people are asking, given the  history of the sport – they have been let down so many times before.

‘But I’m also one of those people who’s been let down. I’ve also believed in people who have turned out to be cheats and liars. But I can assure you, I’m not.’

The media even asked Team Sky to release all the data it has on Froome, to combat accusations of doping. The team initially refused because it said it might help its rivals, but in an unusual step, it gave French newspaper L’Equipe data collected over the past two years. The information was analysed by physiologist Dr Fred Grappe, who did not find any abnormalities.

He concluded Froome’s performance wasn’t as a result of doping but simply ‘at the upper bounds of what is physiologically possible’.

Froome has been subjected to 19 drug tests during this tour and 29 in total this season.Froome’s path to professional cycling, from mountain biking on dusty roads in the nature reserves of Kenya’s Great Rift Valley to the giddy heights of the Tour de France and the Olympics, has been unlike any other in the sport.

Born in Nairobi to British parents, he was educated in South Africa and studied economics at university.

But he abandoned his degree to take up the offer of a professional cycling contract in Europe.

At first he struggled, not being used to the harsh winters, or the tactics, discipline and etiquette needed in the professional sport. But within two years he had signed for the biggest professional team in the world – Team Sky – and last year finished runner-up to team-mate Wiggins.

Tension still surrounds the two men after Froome sacrificed his own chances to support Wiggins’ bid for victory last year.

Even their partners became embroiled in an unseemly Twitter row, with Froome’s girlfriend, South African photographer Michelle Cound, tweeting: ‘Teamwork is also about giving the people around you, that support you, a chance to shine in their own right.’

Cath Wiggins replied to praise  Team members Mick Rogers and Richie Porte for ‘genuine, selfless effort and true professionalism’ – but did not mention Froome.

Today’s procession into Paris will take place later than usual, with organisers delaying the start in the hope of a sunset finish.

Isle of Man rider Mark Cavendish – dubbed the Manx Missile – has won the past four sprints on the Champs-Elysees and is aiming to become the first rider to win the final stage five times.
