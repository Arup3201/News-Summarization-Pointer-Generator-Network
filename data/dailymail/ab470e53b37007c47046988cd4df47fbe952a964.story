This is the moment a boisterous young lion tells his brother to shove off as he pushes him to the ground with his two front paws in a no-holds barred play fight.

The two creatures woke early and finding themselves with nothing to do as the rest of the pride slept.

They stalked one another before squaring up and lashing out.

The siblings were seen fighting before the rest of the pride woke up in the Phinda Reserve in Zululand, South Africa

The youngsters made the most of being awake before the rest of the pride by taking swipes at each other

If they were trying to fight in private, it didn't work as the commotion roused their family from their slumber

The pair rolled around on the floor before one of them gave the other a strong push in the chest.

The commotion woke the rest of the pride and two other siblings piled in to calm things down.

The morning tussle at the Phinda Game Reserve in Zululand, South Africa, was captured by amateur photographer Alan Murray, who was watching the group from a van.

Mr Murray, 56, from Durban, South Africa, had been observing the pride of three lionesses and six youngsters before the quarrel broke out.

He said: 'We arrived before sunrise and found the pride which we had followed most of the previous day .

'On arrival it was obvious that they had been sleeping for some time. I think our arrival disturbed two of the sub-adults and they began to get active and stalk one another.

'The others watched proceedings and eventually could not resist joining in, eventually all six sub-adults were engaged in stalking and ambushing one another.

'They were play fighting but it was quite a boisterous affair.

'This went on for a while until the three adult lionesses got up and started moving towards a waterhole.

'The sub-adults naturally tagged along behind them.

'The entire pride ended the morning together on a flattened termite mound where they posed obligingly for the camera.'

The commotion woke up their siblings, who gladly piled in
