Socialites Ben and Kate Goldsmith will divorce tomorrow - following a bitter split that saw multi-millionairess Kate linked with American rapper Jay Electronica.

The couple are due to be granted a 'quickie' divorce at London's High Court on Thursday after the breakdown of their eight-year marriage.

After raging over Twitter, Ben - the son of the late billionaire James Goldsmith and socialite Annabel Goldsmith - admitted he was 'stupid' to have become embroiled in a nasty row after their breakup two years ago.

He is now dating lingerie model and film producer Jemima Jones, while the exact nature of Kate's relationship with rapper Jay is now unclear after the pair were believed to have had a 'passionate' affair.

New Orleans-born rapper Jay, 36, whose real name is Timothy Elpadaro
Thedford, is the father of singer Erykah Badu's daughter, Mars Merkaba Thedford. The couple were together for nine years.

Financier Ben, 32, has just returned after whisking off his girlfriend of six months, Jemima, 25, to Morocco.

And earlier this month, he told the Mail's Richard Kay: ‘Things are good. We’ve just returned from a romantic trip and it was wonderful.'

The pair made their first public appearance last September at fundraiser for anti-factory farming campaign Pig Business at London restaurant Sake No Hana.

‘I am going to introduce her to Kate in the next two weeks,’ financier and environmentalist Ben told his sister-in-law Alice at the event, organised by the Marchioness of Worcester. ‘Kate doesn’t love me any more – she doesn’t care.’

His elder brother, MP Zac, 38, made Kate’s younger sister Alice, 26, his second wife, in March.

Zac admitted that he was foolhardy to have lashed out at Kate on Twitter, telling The Telegraph: 'I was stupid to have said anything on Twitter. It's no excuse, but I was devastated,' he told The Telegraph.

Police arrested Ben at the couple’s 
£20million Kensington home in April 2011 on suspicion of actual bodily harm.

It followed a confrontation between the Eton-educated financier, who 
inherited £300million after the death of his father, and his wife over explicit texts and emails between her and Jay Electronica.

Mr Goldsmith later accepted a caution for assault before announcing he was filing for divorce on grounds of adultery.

The couple married in 2003 when they were aged 23 and 21.

A friend of Mr Goldmsith told The Sunday Times: 'He was in a terrible state. Unless you've been through an acrimonious divorce you can't imagine what they were going through. Ben was desperately in love with her and I think marrying so young was a way of escaping the Goldsmith playboy image and establishing a stable foundation for his life. Then it all went wrong.'

During the Twitter row, Mr Goldsmith responded to an interview his estranged
wife had given, blaming their split on the young age at which they 
married, said:
‘Someone PLEASE shut this girl up. It’s embarrassing.’

His tweet then 
provoked a response from the man Ms Rothschild left her husband for.

Responding to Mr Goldsmith, American rapper Jay Electronica tweeted: ‘I’m getting sick and tired of your bull***t, Ben,’ and he added: ‘Get a grip.’

After the series of bitter messages, the couple released a joint statement through a PR company. It said: ‘We are both deeply saddened that our marriage has ended after nine years.

‘It is a matter of regret to us that, at a time when our emotions and those of our friends have run high, things have been said in public which should have been kept private. We accept our full share of responsibility for this.

‘There will be no further comment, either directly or indirectly, from us on any aspect of our family’s private life.’

Record company boss Kate, 30, is still living in her marital home in Kensington, West London, with her three young children – just a stone’s-throw away from Jay Electronica, who moved from Belgravia to be near her.

However, last September, the Mail on Sunday reported Kate was 'unimpressed' by his budding friendship with stunning Burberry model Cara Delevingne.

A source said: ‘Kate and Jay are having fearful rows as he’s getting too close to Cara for her liking.’
