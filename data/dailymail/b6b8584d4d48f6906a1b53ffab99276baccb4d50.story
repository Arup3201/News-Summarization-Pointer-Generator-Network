They are the gateway's to some of the world's top tourist attractions but rarely do airports top the discerning traveller's list of must-see spots.

And while nothing may detract from the often painful experience of mass market air travel, there is a new breed of airports which are making flight delays a more pleasurable prospect.

Ten terminals around the globe have been selected by international website DesignCurial to highlight the best in inspiring design and breathtaking architecture.

Bilbao: Likened to a dove taking flight, the Sondika airport in Spain's northern city of Bilbao is among those chosen by experts at international website DesignCurial

But the bad news is that most of the 
buildings are off the beaten path for most mainstream travellers, lying 
in cities such as Osaka, Japan and Uruaguay's capital city Montevideo.

In collating their top 10, designers from the site, said: 'Airports present a unique challenge for architects, engineers and developers, requiring large flat spaces, good visibility and favourable wind conditions.

'But they are also among our most amazing buildings.'

UK holidaymakers eager to tick off some of the stunning buildings will find the three European terminals the easiest to reach.

Madrid: The Spanish capital's Barajas airport was selected for its spectacular sculpture

Madrid: Spain was the only country in the world to feature two airports in the top 10

Spain is the only country to feature two 
airports on the list - represented by both Madrid's spectacularly 
sculptural Barajas airport, and Bilbao's dove-like Sondika.

And rounding off a trio of stylish European representatives, the Gardenmoen airport in Oslo, Norway joins Spain's top terminals.

The airport's Terminal 2, constructed in 2008 and designed by Aviaplan, features a light, floating roof and is primarily constructed from wood, metal and glass.

Asia also features three of the top 10 best-designed airports, led by the world's first ocean terminal.

Kansai airport, in Osaka, Japan, was designed by the Italian architect, Renzo Piano - also responsible for London's Shard.

Standing proud, in the 
middle of Osaka Bay, the terminal was built in 1994 on an artificial 
island - making it the first ocean airport in the world and visible from
space.

Joining the Japanese spectacle, is Beijing's vast international airport and the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) in Malaysia.

Kuala Lumpur: The Malaysian capital's international airport was one of three in Asia added to the top 10 best-designed terminals in the world

Beijing: With its dramatic, concave roof canopy, Bejing's Terminal 3 building is not only the second busiest airport in the world but among those selected as the most impressive

Surrounded by tropical rainforest and built around a central garden, the Kuala Lumpur International Airport opened in the Malaysian capital in 1998.

With its dramatic, concave roof canopy, Bejing's Terminal 3 building is not only the second busiest airport in the world but among those selected as the most impressive.

The stunning structure was completed just in time for the 2008 Olympics.

Across the Atlantic in the US and South America, two terminals caught the sharp eyes of design experts at the website.

Carrasco International serving Uruaguay's capital city Montevideo and Denver International, with it's Lords Cricket style tent like roof, mimicking the line of the Rockie Mountains, make up the Americas contribution.

Formed from a single, 1,000ft low arch, the terminal buildingÂ  features a glazed mezzanine, offering a degree of theatre for passengers.

A dramatic series of giant tents sets the King Abdulaziz terminal in Jeddah in Saudi Arabia apart from the rest.

The 1980's design still manages to provoke gasps from the millions of passengers passing through the terminal each year.

While dwarfing the largest of passenger jets, the building serves to protect travellers from the searing desert sun.

Marrakesh: The Menara airport offers a stunning gateway to Morocco

And finally in Africa the stunning lattice work offering shade to passengers at the 
Menara airport in Marrakech, Morroco completed the top 10.

The extension, added in 2008, was singled out by designers, impressed by the celebration of Islamic geometry.
