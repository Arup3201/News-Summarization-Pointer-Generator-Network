It was the war which ravaged Europe and changed the world forever - a cataclysmic conflict which a horrified world swore never to forget.

And, true to their word, one hundred years after the first shots were fired in the devastating conflict, the trenches, shells and muddy craters can still be seen in one of the First World War's most famous battlefields in Ypres.

In Ypres, Belgium, which saw some of the fiercest fighting of the war in three bloody and protracted battles, part of the battlefield has been kept as close as possible to its appearance, in an area nicknamed Sanctuary Wood by sheltering soldiers for whom the trees provided additional cover.

The poignant photographs, showing stacks of old munitions as well as a war grave on the battlefield itself, come as across the country people prepare to remember Britain's entrance into the war on August 4, 1914.

Preserved: A network of trenches in Sanctuary Wood, part of the battlefield at Ypres in Belgium, has been kept in the same state as it would have been during the war

Row on row: Soldiers nicknamed the area Sanctuary Wood because of the additional cover afforded them by the trees, shielding them from enemy shells

Craters: Mud-filled holes left by shells from both sides can still be seen at the site, which was a centre of conflict throughout the war

Remember them: Tributes to four soldiers who died at Typres can be seen secreted in the mud to the right of the picture, while the trench runs on to the left

Members of the Royal family and senior politicians will attend events across the UK and also in Belgium - the nation which the British Empire declared war on Germany to protect. 

In Glasgow, Prime Minister David Cameron, Prince Charles and Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond will attend a morning commemoration service at Glasgow Cathedral.

A parade will then process to the cenotaph in nearby George Sqaure for a wreath-laying service and march-past planned for 11.30am.

Meanwhile in Folkestone, Kent, Prince Harry will unveil a memorial arch on the Road to Remembrance, down which soldiers would have walked on their way to transport ships bound for the front lines.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will attend a memorial service in Mons, Belgium. Prince William and Kate will be hosted by the Belgian government at the St Symphorien military cemetery, close to much of the fighting in the early phases of the war.

Later on the Duchess of Cornwall will be present at a vigil in Westminster Abbey at 10pm tomorrow, where a single oil lamp will be lit at the Grave of the Unknown Warrior.

The sombre ceremony will coincide with a nationwide initiative to turn out all the lights in houses and office buildings except a single bulb or candle for an hour. The plan is a tribute to a famous remark by the Foreign Secretary at the time, Edward Grey, who said on the eve of the war: 'The lamps are going out all over Europe; we shall not see them lit again in our lifetime.'

Bombs: Munitions cases which would have flown across the Belgian skies in the early days of the First World War have been gathered up at the preserved site

Rescue remains: The metal fragments pictured above were once part of a stretcher used to carry the wounded away from the front lines

Poignant: A lonely cross marks the grave of a single soldier, surrounded by trenches, as new life grows alongside it even in the scarred landscape

Among the buildings taking part in the switch-off will be the Houses of Parliament, Broadcasting House in London, the Eden Project in Cornwall, St Paul’s and Durham cathedrals and Wales Millennium centre in Cardiff.

Also expected to join in are office buildings including Barclays in Canary Wharf, Bloomberg’s European HQ in the City and Marks & Spencer. 

Every British embassy and high commission will switch off its lights and light a candle at 11pm local time before posting pictures on Twitter. 

That evening, a candlelit vigil and evening service will also be held at the National Memorial Arboretum near Alrewas, Staffordshire. The Arboretum is a site of remembrance covered in trees and monuments dedicated to different groups of people who fought in or were affected by both World Wars, and other conflicts.

On August 5 another poignant reminder of war will be officially unveiled at the Tower of London, which has been coated with thousands of ceramic poppies as part of an art installation.

The work of artist Paul Cummins and titled Blood Swept Lands And Seas Of Red, it will eventually include 888,246 poppies, representing all the British or colonial military fatalities in the war.

It will grow over the summer, and the last poppy will be planted on November 11, symbolically marking the end of the First World War. From tomorrow, each poppy will be available to buy for £25, with proceeds shared among military charities.

It is just one of the commemorations taking place across the country in remembrance of those who died in those terrible years.

Cascade of red: Volunteers at the Tower of London were today installing even more porcelain poppies outside the building in memory of the fallen

Delicate: One young man bends down to check one of the ornate blooms. In total 800,000 porcelain poppies are expected to be planted at the tower

Sea of red: The artwork, called Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red, will be officially unveiled on Tuesday August 5
