A North Carolina television reporter made his own headlines when he accidentally split his pants during a live news report.

Anchor Chris Lea was shooting at WXII 12 News live Backyard BBQ when he decided to challenge a Forbush High School cheerleader to a toe touch competition.

The girl pulled off her jump even in spite of an ankle injury and put the pressure on Lea to perform.

A reporter off camera warns Lea to be careful not to split his pants just as he jumps

'Ready Chris? Don’t split your pants honey. I’m worried about your 
pants,' another reporter wisely warned. 

Yahoo reports Lea then lept into the air pulling off a great toe touch but at some cost.

When he tried his own energetic jump, you could indeed hear the sound of seams ripping.

The next sound was the crowd's laughter as Lea tried to cover the burst pants.

At least he had a sense of humor about himself, later tweeting: 'Eh...no biggie it happens.'
