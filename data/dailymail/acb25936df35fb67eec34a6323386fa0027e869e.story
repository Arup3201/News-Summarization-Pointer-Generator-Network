Sentenced: Carer Angela Perkins was jailed for two years after admitting stealing £100,000 from a 90-year-old dementia sufferer

A carer who stole £100,000 from a 90-year-old dementia patient has been jailed for two years.

Angela Perkins siphoned money from the vulnerable patient's life savings between 2005 and 2010.

Perkins, from Norwich, in Norfolk, helped patients to do their shopping and had access to the woman's PIN and bank accounts.

She had originally been charged with stealing £55,000 from the woman in July last year, but it was later discovered that she had stolen almost double that amount.

The 47-year-old was handed a two year prison sentence at Norwich Crown Court after admitting the theft at a previous hearing.

The victim is in 24-hour residential care.

Det Con Huw Caine, of Norfolk Police, said after the sentencing: 'The actions of Perkins left the victim confused, upset and extremely traumatised with worry due to the fact her savings had dwindled away and she didn't have any money left in her account.

'Perkins exploited the fact the victim was vulnerable and removed money from the victim's account for her own use, abusing her position of trust.

'When Perkins was challenged in interview about accounting for cash withdrawals from the victim's account that corresponded with deposits into her own account she was unable to give any satisfactory answers.'

He added: 'The case highlights that offences of this nature and the targeting of some of our most vulnerable people in society will not be tolerated.

'I hope that the results of this case highlight to other potential offenders how robustly Norfolk Constabulary will investigate and deal with such incidents.'

Norfolk Police said it was now trying to confiscate money from Perkins under the Proceeds of Crime Act.

Should a confiscation order be served and Perkins fail to pay up, she could face an additional sentence.
