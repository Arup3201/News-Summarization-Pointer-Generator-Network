Naked models are turned into works of art by a painter who spends hours blending their bodies into urban street scenes.

Trina Merry, 33, uses body paint to camouflage the women against graffiti and murals on walls and buildings.

The invisible artwork regularly catches passers-by off guard, who fail to notice the people hiding behind the paint as she painstakingly copies every detail onto the model.

Camouflaged: Artist Trina Merry painstakingly uses body paint to disguise models against graffiti

Disguised: The artist takes inspiration from the murals and tags around her native San Francisco

Intricate: It can take Trina up to eight hours to a complete a complex camo painting

Each of the artist's pieces take up to eight hours to create and can often never be reproduced as graffiti work is constantly removed from streets.

Trina's range of work sees her mask a number of models into portraits, urban tags or abstract pieces.

Trina, from San Francisco, California, said: 'My work started when I was essentially asked to get on stage at a rock concert in my underwear and get body painted - that was my first exposure to body paint.

'And I have been working on them ever since.

'I was working with urban art as a visual artist and wanted to keep making work with my friends when I transitioned to body paint as my medium, so I started doing these camouflage collaborations.

'Inspiration is a little tricky at times - it can be instant or can take a period of time and contemplation to develop a concept.

Introduction: The artist first used body paint when she was at a rock concert and was painted on stage

Concealed: Only the model's feet are instantly noticeable after she is blended into the intricate design

'Other times I just walk on the street, see a mural I fall in love with, and start painting a model into it.

'Graffiti is created and destroyed so fast on the street, that I find I've had to be responsive to it.'

Trina's work is done on the streets of her hometown in San Francisco.

And willing volunteers are often easy to come by as her popularity grows in the trendy art scene of the American city.

Trina said: 'I was working with urban art as a visual artist and wanted to keep making work with my friends when I transitioned to body paint as my medium, so I started doing these camouflage collaborations.

'My camo paintings take about one or two hours each. In general, body paintings take from four to eight hours, but painting on the street live gives me a specific energy that is heightened.'

On the look out: Trina said she has to be 'responsive' to street art as it changes or is destroyed so quickly

Hidden: The camouflage is so convincing that passers-by are shocked when they realise a model is there

One-off: Some of the artist's pieces can never be reproduced because the murals change
