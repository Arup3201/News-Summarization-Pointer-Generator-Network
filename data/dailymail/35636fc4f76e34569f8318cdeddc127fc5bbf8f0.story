A recent survey reveals there may be a wrong side of the bed after all.

In celebration of Sleep Awareness Week from March 2 to March 8, a survey conducted by the mattress company Saatva found that a majority of Americans prefer the right side of the bed.

The study also found that men were more likely than women to care about which side of the bed they were sleeping on and women cared more about which direction they were facing in bed.

Who's side are you on? : In celebration of Sleep Awareness Week from March 2 to March 8, a survey conducted by the mattress company Satva found that a majority of Americans prefer the right side of the bed

Of the Americans surveyed, 40 per cent said that they have always slept on the same side of the bed, reports APP.com

More than half of those in the study said that they didn't consciously pick the side of the bed that they were sleeping on nightly and if given the decision now, 30 per cent said they would switch to the other side.

64 per cent of Americans said that they preferred not facing their partners while the other 36 per cent prefer to face their partner.

Women tended to need more space than men with 72 per cent of women saying they don’t like facing their partner and only 55 per cent of men answering the same thing.

The study by Saatva revealed that Americans chose their side of the bed based on what they are sleeping closest to and technology was a major factor in their decision.

A third of Americans said they'd prefer to sleep on the side of the bed that is closest to an electrical outlet compared to 67 per cent who wanted to be closer to the bathroom, 58 per cent who wanted to be closest to a window, and just 48 per cent who wanted to be nearest to a door.

Half of American Couples who cohabitate said that they both preferred the same side of the bed and that 79 per cent of then had to give up that side to their partner.

20 per cent of Americans said that they were unwilling to change sides of the bed for a romantic partner and were more likely to give up the television remote.
