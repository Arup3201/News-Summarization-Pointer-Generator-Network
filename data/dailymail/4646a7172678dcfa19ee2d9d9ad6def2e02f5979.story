Many children dream of becoming an astronaut and flying into space.

But seven-year-old Dexter Anderson was determined to turn his dream in to a reality by writing a letter to his future employer.

And the schoolboy from England was left stunned when he received a detailed response from NASA - which encouraged him to pursue his dream of visiting his favourite planet, Mars.Â

The adorable handwritten letter reads: 'Dear NASA, My name is Dexter I heard that you are sending two people to Mars and I would like to come but I'm 7.'

He then adds that he would like to go in the future though, and asked whether NASA could give him any tips about becoming an astronaut.

NASA replied to Dexter with a note encouraging him to pursue his space dreams as well as a detailed package about Mars complete with posters and stickers.

In its letter back to Dexter, NASA told the boy that he could someday become a space pioneer, telling him: 'Just think - in a few years, you could be one of the pioneers that may help lead the world's activities for better understanding of our earth and for exploring space.'

Dear NASA... Dexter Anderson's letter about his dream of becoming an astronaut to the space agency

The space agency closed the letter by saying: 'Your interest in NASA is appreciated. NASA wishes you every success in earning good school grades and encourages you to keep reaching for the stars!'

Dexter's delighted mother Katrina Anderson posted both letters on the website Reddit and they quickly went viral.

She said that Dexter decided to write the letter after becoming inspired by a trip to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

Ms Anderson told the Huffington Post: 'His initial reaction was shock. He couldn't believe he got a package that big from NASA, honestly I thought he'd only get a letter at best.

'Then he excitedly tore open the letter somewhat carefully and read the letter out loud.

He then looked at the pictures then put them in his room for safe keeping. He loves science and maths and after visiting the Kennedy Space Centre last year his interest has known no bounds!'

NASA's Office of Public Inquiries, which replied to Dexter's letter, responds to hundreds of thousands of public inquiries every year on a variety of topics.

But Press Secretary Lauren Worley told website Mashable that the team particularly enjoys responding to aspiring astronauts.

She said: 'NASA is working to send humans farther into space than ever before, first to an asteroid and on to Mars. Perhaps one of these young writers will be among the first astronauts to set foot on another planet.'
