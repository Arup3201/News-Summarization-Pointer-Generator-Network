A Muslim American accused of plotting to fly 
explosives-packed remote-controlled model planes into the Pentagon and 
the U.S. Capitol has pleaded not guilty.

Rezwan Ferdaus, 26, is charged in the plot to fly three tiny aircraft into the government buildings and to follow up the attacks with a ground assault.

He is also accused of attempting to provide material support and resources to the global Islamist militant network Al-Qaeda for attacks on U.S. soldiers overseas.

Ferdaus, an American citizen and resident of Ashland, Massachusetts, yesterday pleaded not guilty to all charges in U.S. District Court in Worcester.

It marked his first public appearance since he was arrested on September 28 following a months-long undercover investigation led by the FBI.

Ferdaus, a 26-year-old with a physics degree from Northeastern University, was arrested in Framingham after federal agents posing as Al-Qaeda members delivered what he is said to have believed was 24 pounds of C-4 explosive.

Authorities said the public was never in danger from the plot.

The accused's lawyer Catherine Byrne said the case was 'orchestrated and facilitated by the government'.

She told reporters after yesterday's hearing: 'We have asked for a continuance for additional time in order to prepare and to further investigate so that we can present a more complete picture of what happened.'

Conduit: A scale model of a U.S. Navy F-4 Phantom fighter plane similar to one of three Ferdaus allegedly planned to use in a coordinated attack

Chilling: This model F-86 Sabre is similar to another of the three tiny planes that Ferdaus allegedly planned to load with plastic explosives

The arrest was the latest in a string of terror arrests to emerge from similar sting operations.

A
federal affidavit says Ferdaus began planning jihad - or holy war - 
against the U.S. in early 2010 after becoming convinced through jihadi 
websites and videos that America was evil.

A group of nearly a dozen family members and friends attended Ferdaus' court appearance.

Several
women, including his mother, wept as the charges against him were read.
They shouted 'We love you!' as he was led out of the courtroom; he 
quietly answered, 'I love you, too.'

Target: A surveillance photo of the Pentagon, said to be taken by Ferdaus on a visit to Washington last May

Charged: Ferdaus, 26, has a degree in physics from Northeastern University

Also
in attendance were the parents of Tarek Mehanna, another Massachusetts 
man arrested in a separate terror plot. They said they did not know 
Ferdaus' family but went to show their support.

Mehanna
is scheduled for trial later this month. Authorities say he conspired 
to provide material support to Al-Qaeda and kill U.S. troops in Iraq.

Ferdaus
faces up to 100 years in prison on charges including attempting to 
damage and destroy national defence premises and attempting to provide 
material support to terrorists.

A detention hearing is set for October 20.
