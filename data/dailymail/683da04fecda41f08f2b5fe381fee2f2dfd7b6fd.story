Liverpool are prepared to pay an increase on the £10million fee they have agreed with Lille to accelerate Divock Origi’s release in January.

The Belgium forward, whom Brendan Rodgers believes will be a ‘world-class striker’, joined Liverpool in August but was immediately loaned back to Lille to continue his development before heading to Anfield next summer.

But such is Liverpool’s keenness to bring Origi in, they would be ready to pay a premium to get him in the new year. Rodgers’ side have been desperately short of goals, with Daniel Sturridge missing 14 games through injury and Rickie Lambert, Mario Balotelli and Fabio Borini struggling.

Lille, however, have given no indication that they would be willing to re-jig the original terms of the deal, which meant he would stay the full season in France, and hand Origi to Liverpool early - even if the 19-year-old has admitted he would be happy to move in January.

‘It is not me who makes the decisions but if the club choose to let me go in January I would go, I would like to join Liverpool then,’ said Origi, who scored for Belgium in their 3-1 win over Iceland on Wednesday.

‘I said I would stay for the whole season and I wish to remain honourable in that, of course. But if there was a decision by the clubs, I would not say I wouldn’t like to go to Liverpool in January. Brendan Rodgers is in contact, he (speaks) regularly, he wants to know how I am feeling.

‘It makes me feel very good and wanted. Also the medical staff, they stay in touch for the same reason – to keep me involved, telling me that they are looking forward to me coming to the club. If there was that chance of joining Liverpool sooner I would take it.

‘I would love to move to Liverpool sooner rather than later. I am here at Lille. It’s fine, they are a good club and they have helped me. But I can’t wait to be playing in the Premier League because I can now see that it will suit me better. I think there are good things waiting for me with Liverpool.’

Origi, who has scored five goals in France this season, played for Lille in both their Europa League matches against Everton recently. He has made a point of watching how Liverpool have fared and believes their current position in the Barclays Premier League does not reflect their capabilities.

‘I have been following Liverpool closely, the events of what has been going on and I think they have had a difficult time,’ said Origi. ‘They have a team with a lot of talent, with a lot of good players. They also have a very, very good coach.

‘But they have had a lot of injuries and this has not helped them. It is difficult when you do not have a player like Daniel Sturridge, for instance. What I believe is that they just have to be more efficient but I also believe that it is only a matter of time before it comes.’
