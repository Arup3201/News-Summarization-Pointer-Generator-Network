A college professor who paints Osama bin Laden as a freedom fighter and the U.S. as a 'neocolonial power' in a textbook he co-authored has listed it as required reading for his students.

Emmit Evans requires students at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo to read the book entitled 'The Other World'.

'The Al Qaeda movement of Osama bin Laden
 is one example of an attempt to free a country (in this case, Saudi 
Arabia) from a corrupt and repressive regime propped up by a neocolonial
 power (in this case, the United States),' the book says.

While he requires students taking his 
World Food Systems class to read the book, he does not make them pay for
 it and instead provides them with a free copy online.

Teachings: Dr Emmit Evans, left, a political science professor at Cal Poly requires his students to read his textbook, in which he describes Osama bin Laden, right, as a freedom fighter

But one of his students, Aaron Bandler, who calls himself a proud conservative, was shocked by what he has called 'indoctrination'.

'It totally blew my mind that a professor would essentially call Al Qaeda a bunch of freedom fighters in required reading for class,' Bandler, a junior who took the class in the fall semester, told Fox News.

But when asked about the sentence about bin Laden, Evans said that he simply presents facts and doesn't make a value judgment on them.

'With respect to my writings, they are empirical, not normative,' he told Fox.

Bandler said the class leaned to the left for the entire semester, which he thought was irresponsible.

'He
 was encouraging us to be activists,' Bandler said. 'The whole last part
 of the course was about how to cause "positive change"... but his 
examples of positive change were all stuff like Occupy Wall Street, the 
Arab Spring, and raising the minimum wage.

Anger: Student Aaron Bandler, who took the class last semester, complained that the class was too left-leaning and focused on sustainability, which he claimed did a disservice to the students

'He would say things like, "I know you guys can go out there and make things more sustainable",' Bandler said, citing this as a problem.

Book: He co-wrote the book, The Other World, which he provides to students for free

In an opinion piece for The College Fix, he added that Evans brought a Covered California representative talk to the class about the Affordable Care Act, convincing students to sign up.

'His slant does a disservice to Cal Poly students,' he wrote. 'And in my mind it rises to the level of academic malfeasance.'

After he had secured his grade, he reached out to his professor about his concerns with the class.

Evans responded that he had listed his intentions for the class in the course description.

'Course evaluations sometimes include
 comments similar to yours, which encourage us to make the goals and 
focus of the course as explicit as possible,' Evans wrote. 'I'm sorry if I didn't 
accomplish that as well as I could have in your case, but am pleased you
 didnâ€™t un-enjoy the class!'

Evans said his one bias is towards sustainability. He said he outlines this in the course description.

'World Food Systems has a built-in 
slant:on sustainability,' Evans said. 'We do not focus on "the other 
side" - how we might build more unsustainable food systems.'

Bandler said his political views didn't affect his grade, and called Evans 'a funny 
professor with a lot of interesting things to say', in an opinion piece 
for The College Fix.

Classroom: Evans teaches in San Luis Obispo and says he explains what the class covers in its description

'I
 found the course to be very thought-provoking,' he said. 'These issues should be 
discussed in a college class. But Evans only showed the liberal side of 
each issue. While I enjoyed the class, I would have liked to have heard 
counter arguments.'

Other reviews about Dr Evans posted online by students are far more flattering and thanked the professor for challenging their views and opening their minds.

'The most powerful, insightful, eye opening class ever taken at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo,' one student wrote.

'If you are not open minded do not take this class. You do not deserve to be lectured on ways to change this world. People with strong moral and ethical character take this class. You will understand the way the world truly is and how you can deal with it or change it.'

Another added: 'World Food Systems is a class that everyone should take...it will change your life!'
