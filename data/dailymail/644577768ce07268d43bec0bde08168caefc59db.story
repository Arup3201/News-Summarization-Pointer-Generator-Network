A home intruder was given the gift of lead when a California homeowner shot the man he found in his home early Christmas morning.

Nathaniel Blair of Anaheim Hills had just exchanged presents with his wife and gone out to move his truck when he encountered a man in a ski mask inside his home.

'I opened the door and was like, is this happening right now?' he told NBC.

The intruder, who police later identified as 29-year-old Jeremy William Bell, attacked Blair with a large wrench before trying to escape on foot.

'At that point in time, I'm like, you know what man, you came to the wrong home if you think you're going to come into my house and do that,' Blair said.

ABC reports he ran upstairs and locked the door leading to his wife and three-year-old daughter before grabbing his 12-gauge shotgun and pursuing the would-be burglar.

'I had my gun and he tried to round the corner, and I shot him, you know, in the back,' said Blair.

'The resident fired one shot, and struck the suspect who continued to flee on foot,' said Lt Bob Dunn of the Anaheim Police Department.

The officers had already responded around 11pm to reports of a man in a ski mask trying to break into a basement window at a nearby home. They returned around 3.30am to search for the man Blair shot.

CBS reports that around 5am, officers located Bell with minor injuries in the garage of a third home with the assistance of bloodhounds and a K9 unit.

He was charged with robbery and is being investigated for additional charges in relation to the first report. 

According to SF Gate, California courts have upheld the right of residents to use force against an assailant inside or outside their home if they have a reasonable fear of injury or death.

Rulings include the right 'if reasonably necessary, to pursue an assailant until the danger of death or great bodily injury has passed. This is so even if safety could have been achieved by retreating.' 

'At least be able to know that my family is safe and sound,' Blair told ABC 'You know, the rest of my Christmas Day, we'll just have to see how it ends up going.'
