The frontman of the rock band Sum 41 has warned his young fans of the dangers of drinking, after his liver and kidney collapsed.

Deryck Whibley, the Canadian rockstar who used to be married to Avril Lavigne, spent more than a month in hospital after collapsing at home.

Doctors have told the 34-year-old his organs are so damaged that if he has just one more drink he could die.

In an emotional post on his website Friday, the Grammy-nominated musician revealed he had been seriously ill in hospital, and had spent a week unconscious and attached to an IV drip.

'I was drinking hard every day. Until 
one night. I was sitting at home, poured myself another drink around midnight and was about to watch a movie when all of a sudden I didn't feel
 so good,' the musician wrote in a post.

His fiancée rushed him to hospital, where he was later told that his kidneys and liver had collapsed, Rolling Stone reported.

'Needless to say it scared me straight. I finally realized I can’t drink anymore. If I have one drink the doc’s say I will die,' he said.

The singer added: 'I’m not preaching or anything but just
 always drink responsibly. I didn’t, and look where that got me.'

He
 said: 'I was stuck with needles and IVs all over. i was completely 
sedated the first week. When I finally woke up ... I had no idea where I
 was. My mum and step dad were standing over me. I was so freaked out.'

Whibley has a clear cut approach to his recent health scare, telling fans: 'The reason I got so sick is from all the hard boozing I've been doing over the years. It finally caught up to me.'

While the self-confessed hard drinker can no longer have any alcohol, Whibley has said being forced to quit drinking has renewed his creativity.
