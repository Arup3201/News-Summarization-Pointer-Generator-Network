The NHS official in charge of the controversial plan to centralise patient records claimed £46,000 of taxpayers’ money in expenses for hotel bills and fine dining, it was revealed last night.

Tim Kelsey – whose salary as national director for patients and information was £180,000 in 2013 – was responsible for the highest expenses bill of nine top NHS officials, who claimed nearly £200,000 last year.

Taxpayers paid for taxi fares and five-star hotels. A further £32,000 was claimed by Sir David Nicholson, who was dubbed ‘the man with no shame’ following the Mid Staffordshire scandal.

Staff have now been banned from first-class travel and told to ‘think like a patient and act like a taxpayer’ by Simon Stevens, the new head of the Health Service, in a clampdown on expenses.

A total of £195,802 was spent by just nine board members of NHS England on travel and hotels from 2013-14 – the first year of the organisation’s existence – according to figures released to the Daily Telegraph under the Freedom of Information Act.

The central NHS body was set up to cut bureaucracy in a reorganisation by ministers and led by Sir David, who was criticised after the Mid-Staffordshire scandal for his use of first-class travel.

Mr Kelsey’s £46,000 expenses bill included more than £21,000 on hotels with some expenses totalling £370 a night. He spent almost £7,000 on air fares.

The NHS’s chief nursing officer, Jane Cummings, spent more than £27,000 over the year, including £8,000 on hotels. A further £23,000 was spent by Bill McCarthy, the former national director for policy, including £491 for four nights at a hotel in Berkshire. He recently resigned.

An NHS England spokesman said: ‘In his first address to staff Simon Stevens set the goal of “thinking like a patient, and acting like a taxpayer”. He knows how important this is to the patients and the public. He has already banned first class travel and made clear public transport should always be taken where possible.’

Mr Stevens is expected to announce a new ‘transparency code’ on Thursday.Mr Kelsey is in charge of Care.data. The Mail has repeatedly highlighted GPs’ concerns about the controversial Care.data plan, whereby NHS officials plan to harvest data from patient records.

Charlotte Leslie, a Conservative  member of the Commons health select committee, said: ‘It is a very welcome sign that Simon Stevens seems to understand – in a way his predecessor did not – that these executives should not be a law unto themselves.’
