Steven Gerrard was unable to complete England's first training session in Brazil after feeling tightness in his groin during the Three Lions' work-out at the Urca military base.

The Liverpool skipper took part in some sprints and low intensity drills under the shadow of Sugar Loaf mountain before deciding to end his session prematurely.

Gerrard, who played the first half of England's 0-0 draw with Honduras on Saturday, admitted to a groin issue after the game with the Central American side.

He said: 'I had a tight groin in midweek so it was always the plan for me to play just 45 minutes.'

Gerrard's injury is not believed to be serious but it will still be a concern for Roy Hodgson with England's opening World Cup game against Italy now only five days away.

The 34-year-old, who will captain his country in Brazil, is certain to start in the heart of England's midfield against Cesare Prandelli's side if fit.

Southampton star Adam Lallana also left training early but there has been no suggestion that the midfielder is suffering with an injury ahead of this weekend's Group D showdown.

James Milner caused some concern when he took a breather on the turf, although he only required a plaster for a blister.

Hodgson was buoyed by the return of Alex-Oxlade Chamberlain, who took part in a series of running drills with head physio Gary Lewin less than a week after injuring his knee in the 2-2 draw with Ecuador in Miami.
