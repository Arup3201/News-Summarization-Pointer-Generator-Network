Michael Gove today sought to quash speculation that the Tories’ local election losses will trigger a challenge against David Cameron’s leadership.

The Education Secretary said the idea of ousting the Prime Minister was ‘bonkerooney’ as defeated Tory councillors demanded change at the top.

The Tories lost 335 seats in county and unitary council elections in England, and were pushed into third by Nigel Farage’s UKIP in the South Shields by-election.

Education Secretary Michael Gove said it was 'barmy' to talk about ousting David Cameron as Tory leader

Conservative ministers moved to promise tougher policies on immigration and Europe in an attempt to steady the mood in the party.

But some of the councillors who lost their seats at the hands of UKIP said there had to be fundamental change in the direction of the party.

Tory Alexis McEvoy, who lost her seat in Hampshire, pinned the blame on the Prime Minister.

'Clearly the message was to the government. I hope the government will listen because they never do,' she told the BBC.

'They are arrogant, out of touch and because of them good councillors have now been lost.'

Graham Marsh, a former Conservative councillor in Lincolnshire who also lost his seat said: ‘My rock-bed supporters were absolutely fed up by coalition policy.’

A Conservative MP told BBC Radiop 4: ‘It's time for a leadership election now.’

As news of Tory council election losses emerged, Mr Cameron was meeting scientists before opening the 'Li Ka Shing Centre for Health Information and Discovery' at Oxford University

Mr Cameron, who also visited The Batt School in his Witney constituency, was accused of running an 'out of touch' government by Tory members

But Mr Gove said no-one in the Tory party should think that removing Mr Cameron from Number 10 was the solution to the party’s problems.

‘I think that any of my colleagues who want to indulge in leadership speculation should spend the weekend reading the history books and consider if leadership speculation has ever helped any political party to enhance its position with the voters.

‘With great respect to anyone – actually, with no respect, it’s barmy. The idea of changing the leader is bonkeroony.’

He suggested that many UKIP voters return to the Tory fold when faced with the prospect of Ed Miliband becoming Prime Minister in 2015.

‘At the next election it’s a straightforward choice between David Cameron and Ed Miliband.

‘The second thing is that those people who are voting for UKIP – and they have a number of concerns that we have to respectfully address - those people who are voting for UKIP are emphatically not people who at the next general election are likely to vote for Ed Miliband and they haven’t been persuaded by what passes for his analysis of our current problems.

Tory vice-chairman Michael Fabricant said there had to be 'serious research' into why voters backed UKIP

‘Given how poorly Labour have done today I think there’s every chance at the next general election that many of those who have voted for UKIP will support the Conservatives because faced with that choice between David Cameron and Ed Miliband, I think the majority of the people in the country will conclude that David Cameron is the right person to change Britain for the better.’

Ministers are preparing to use next week's Queen's Speech to set out new measures on welfare and immigration aimed at winning wooing voters who have switched to UKIP.

New laws will be set out to curb benefits for immigrants, amid concern about the impact of the influx of Romanians and Bulgarians when movement restrictions are lifted next year.

A Bill which will limit the right of immigrants to access benefits, the NHS and other public services will form a centrepiece of the coalition's programme.

However, Tory vice-chairman Michael Fabricant said the party had to carry out ‘serious research’ into the message UKIP voters sent at the ballot box

He tweeted: ‘If nothing else, let us be polite to Ukip and their supporters, eh?

‘I hope there will be some serious research about exactly WHAT message UKIP voters are giving: none-of-the-above or specific issues.’

Mr Fabricant added ‘life cannot go on as normal’ for the main three parties ‘unless they have no ambition for 2015’.

Conservative Robert Halfon tweeted: ‘We have 2years to communicate loudly that Conservatives are party which will have IN/OUT Referendum, vetoed EU Treaty & Cut EU Budget.’
