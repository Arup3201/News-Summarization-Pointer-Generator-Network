If Saturday night’s victory over Ireland does prove to be Shaun Edwards’ final RBS 6 Nations hoorah in Cardiff, then the former rugby league man could not have picked a finer evening to bow out.

The Wales defence coach is out of contract after the World Cup and his players delivered a tackling masterclass at the Millennium Stadium.

They repelled wave after wave of attacks to send Ireland’s Grand Slam ambitions up in smoke, providing the 48-year-old with one of his finest hours behind the glass wall of the tactical box. Made from stuff the local steelworks would be proud of, his Welsh rearguard saw off almost 50 phases in seven second-half minutes to set up a three-way title showdown in the final weekend.

‘Only a Six Nations game can bring the emotion out like that,’ said Edwards. ‘Potentially it could be my last Six Nations game with Wales. If it ends up being that way, it was a great way to sign off.

‘It was a victory for team effort and fitness. To keep tackling for that long, you have to be fit. Our attack was very good in the first 20 minutes and it was an incredible Test match. Ireland are a team that never ever give in; they are coming back at you all the time. It was everything that is good about the Six Nations.’

Edwards punched the air in delight on the final whistle. His players racked up a record count of 250 tackles — missing just 22. It did little to damn the notion that northern-hemisphere rugby is geared towards defence, but there was no question about the entertainment value, with the absorbing close-quarter battles making for the best tie of the championship.

‘To defend in your own 22 for nine and a half minutes and concede one try from a maul is a great credit to the lads,’ said Edwards. ‘We kept getting off the floor and into position very quickly, which is a massive part of your defence. If you are on the floor, you are out of the game.

‘Our tackling, in particular our leg chops, was of the highest order. The best form of defence is having the ball, but some periods in a Test match you are going to be asked to defend. I said to the players during the week that potentially we would have to make 150 to 200 tackles.’

His predictions were right. Ireland had 66 per cent of the possession but lacked the wherewithal to break through the wall of red. The bruising hits took their toll on the hosts, with Wales going into their defining tie against Italy with injury worries in the front row, where Samson Lee (achilles) and Gethin Jenkins (hamstring) are expected to miss out, while Richard Hibbard will also face concussion tests.

Jamie Roberts is also doubtful after suffering a blow to the head. The centre is likely to be replaced by Scott Williams, who scored Wales’ only try on Saturday and is in line for his first start of the competition. With Wales needing to improve their points difference in the championship race, the Scarlets midfielder will be expected to add an attacking edge in Rome.

With Wales being the early kick-off this weekend, it will be a case of hit and hope as they watch other results unfold. They have won their last seven games against Italy by an average of 17 points, although an even greater victory is likely to be the minimum requirement at the Stadio Olimpico.

‘We have given ourselves a fighting chance to go out to Rome and win this title again,’ said fly-half Dan Biggar. ‘If we can win it, after everybody writing us off when we lost at home to England, it will be one of this team’s best achievements. Maybe Scotland can do us a favour at home to Ireland and France against England at Twickenham. We know we have to score some points in Italy.’
