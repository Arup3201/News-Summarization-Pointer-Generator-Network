JK Rowling's new detective novel is at the centre of a row between her New York publisher and online retailer Amazon over the price of e-books.

The ongoing standoff has seen Amazon remove pre-order buttons for a number of titles published by Hachette, including 'The Silkworm', which Rowling has written under the pen name Robert Galbraith.

Previous changes had been more subtle, such as the listing for the paperback version of J.D. Salinger's Nine Stories being changed to say delivery will now take three to five weeks, accompanied with notes offering similar items by rival publishers at a lower price and faster delivery time.

Amazon and
 Hachette are reportedly at odds over terms for e-book prices, at a time
 when Amazon is in a position of strength and vulnerability.

The
 Seattle-based company is the most powerful force in the book market, 
believed to have a share of more than 60 percent of e-book sales and at 
least a third of book sales overall.

'We are doing everything in our power to find a solution to this difficult situation, one that best serves our authors and their work, and that preserves our ability to survive and thrive as a strong and author-centric publishing company,' Hachette said in a statement Friday issued through spokeswoman Sophie Cottrell.

Amazon declined to comment.

Numerous Hachette authors have criticized Amazon in recent weeks, including Sherman Alexie and James Patterson, who on his Facebook page noted that the purchase of books written by him, Malcolm Gladwell, Nicholas Sparks and others had been made more difficult.

'What I don't understand about this particular battle tactic is how it is in the best interest of Amazon customers,' Patterson wrote.

'It certainly doesn't appear to be in the best interest of authors.'

Rivals have struggled to compete with Amazon's discounts and customer service.

But recent earnings reports have been disappointing and Amazon's stock prices, which surged for years despite narrow profits, have dropped sharply in 2014.

Amazon has a history of aggressive actions with publishers, most dramatically in 2010 when it removed the buy buttons for releases by Macmillan, where authors include Jonathan Franzen, Bill O'Reilly and Augusten Burroughs.

The issue was also e-books.

Apple was about to launch its iBookstore and Macmillan, Hachette and other publishers, worried over Amazon's $9.99 offerings for popular e-books, wanted Amazon to accept a new system — the agency model — that would allow publishers to set the prices.

Amazon relented, but the system unraveled after the U.S. Department of Justice sued Apple and five publishers in 2012 for alleged price fixing.

The publishers, including Macmillan and Hachette, settled and a federal judge in New York last year ruled against Apple.

Other books currently being delayed or otherwise disrupted include Tina Fey's Bossypants, Gladwell's The Tipping Point and Brad Stone's The Everything Store, a critical portrait of Amazon and founder Jeff Bezos.

Hachette is a multinational conglomerate with headquarters in Paris.

In 2006, the company acquired Time Warner Book Group for half a billion dollars.

In 2013 Hachette bought Disney's adult trade publishing imprint, Hyperion.

Hachette's parent company, Lagardère Group - a publisher, broadcaster and retailer whose magazine titles include French Elle and Paris Match - recorded $7.37bn in net sales in 2012, according to its annual report.
