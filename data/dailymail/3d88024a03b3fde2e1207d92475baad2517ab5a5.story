Jeremy Paxman is reportedly set to earn almost £1 million from a publishing deal that will include a memoir of his time at the BBC.

The veteran broadcaster, 64, famous for discomfiting politicians with his bruising interview style, is said to have signed a three-book contract with the publisher William Collins.

While the first volume will chart the changing face of Britain, another will reveal the inside story of his 42-year career with the Corporation.

In a withering assessment of BBC2’s Newsnight programme, which he left in June, Mr Paxman, left, said it was now ‘run by 13-year-olds, for whom, at that age, it is perfectly normal to want to change the world’.

Meanwhile, Paxman has admitted he was approached about standing as Tory candidate for the mayor of London but said he would not do the job for 'all the eclairs in Paris'.

Paxman, who has described himself as 'a one-nation Tory', was reportedly asked to enter the field to replace Boris Johnson, who is standing down in 2016.

Mr Johnson hopes to return to Parliament next year after being adopted as the Tory candidate for Uxbridge and South Ruislip and the party is yet to find a potential successor.

Paxman said the story 'began life as a Boris Johnson joke', adding: 'I was indeed approached about the gig and invited to see David Cameron to discuss the idea. I decided a week ago that I wouldn't take it on for all the eclairs in Paris.'
