Radamel Falcao clinched a 1-1 draw for Manchester United as 10-man Aston Villa ended their winning run.

The Colombian scored just his second United goal, cancelling out Christian Benteke's beautiful opener for the hosts.

Sportsmail's Laurie Whitwell rated the players' performances at Villa Park.

Aston Villa (3-5-2)

Guzan 7 

Alert to tip wide Young cross that would have flown into far corner and good save from Van Persie

Okore 7 

Another composed display from the 22-year-old, who was asked to collect the ball from his goalkeeper to spark attacks

Vlaar 7 

Imperious at heart of Villa’s defence for the most part, physically dominating his Dutch colleague Van Persie

Manchester United striker Radamel Falcao equalised with a thumping header against Aston Villa

Clark 7 

Growing in importance to this team each week, strong, sensible and calm

Lowton 6 

Unbalanced by Young’s movement for Falcao goal and unable to make amends to stop cross, but decent overall

Weimann 6 

Deployed deeper than usual, in midfield, and added energy, particularly in the first half

Sanchez 6 

Effective at breaking up United’s play and provided a steadying influence when Villa rocked slightly 

Michael Carrick started the game in defence but was moved back into midfield at half-time

Delph 7 

Crunching tackle on Van Persie to announce his intentions and was an effervescent presence

Cissokho 6 

Provided an outlet on the left but too often cut back rather than cross first time

Benteke 7.5 

Took his goal superbly, with a shuffle to find space and clinical shot. Almost got a second with a powerful header 

Agbonlahor 6.5 

Gave Villa pace to trouble United before becoming victim of incredibly harsh red card for his strong tackle on Young

Subs

N’Zogbia (for Weimann 80) 6, Bacuna 6 (for Cissokho 80) 

Both contributed late on and Bacuna almost won it with stunning shot that whistled over. 

United showed theit attacking instincts by playing Robin van Persie, Wayne Rooney and Radamel Falcao

Manchester United 3-5-2

De Gea 7 

No chance with Benteke’s goal and produced his customary excellent save from the Belgian’s second-half header

Jones 6.5 

Competed physically with Benteke in the air but dallied on ball in second half to concede an opening

Carrick 7 

Classy in central defence, moved to midfield at half-time to provide a platform for United attacks

Aston Villa striker Christian Benteke scored a wonderful goal and was a constant threat

Evans 6 

Allowed Benteke too much room for his goal but recovered and marshaled defence from the central position in second half

Valencia 6 

Willing as ever but unable to repeat his high tempo from the Liverpool game

Mata 5.5 

One of his outings where it was difficult to see how he contributed, aside for a few shots from range

Fletcher 5 

Struggled to impose himself to any great degree and was understandably replaced at half-time

Rooney 7 

United’s best player, pulling strings from midfield with floated passes to the wings and sharp balls into the strikers 

Gabby Agbonlahor was controversially sent off after a 50-50 challenge with Ashley Young

Young 6.5 

Villain-in-chief as far as Villa fans were concerned, staying down after Agbonlahor’s tackle, but perfect cross for Falcao goal

Falcao 6.5 

Hardly touched the ball for long periods but provided a finishing touch with his forehead when required

Van Persie 6 

A couple of efforts and adept link-up play but should have done better when fed by Rooney inside the area

Angel di Maria returned for Manchester United after missing three games because of a hamstring injury

Subs 

Blackett 6.5 (for Fletcher 46), Di Maria 6 (for Van Persie 62), Wilson 5 (for Valencia 74) 

Blackett’s arrival freed United in an attacking sense, Di Maria added a threat, Wilson some legs
