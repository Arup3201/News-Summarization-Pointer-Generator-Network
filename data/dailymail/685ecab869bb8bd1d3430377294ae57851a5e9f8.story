Police immediately questioned McGee, who they claim was the last person to see Michaels alive.

The knife - which the McGee allegedly bought when he was 16 - was found by police inside the McGee family's Blacklick home.

According to Reynoldsburg police, McGee confessed to detectives that he had played an active role in her death.

Detectives said the teen provided them with details that only a suspect would know.

'This person confessed and gave us significant indication that he was aware of the condition of the body, and the crime scene led us to believe at that point that we have the right person,' O'Neill said.

While the suspect alleged Michaels’ 
death was an accident, police say McGee knew what he was doing. They 
claim McGee also cut Michael's arm with the knife.

Autopsy results are pending as to the official cause of Michaels’ death, according to the Licking County Coroner’s Office.
