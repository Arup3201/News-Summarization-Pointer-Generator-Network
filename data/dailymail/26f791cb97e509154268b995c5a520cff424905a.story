A 99-year-old woman was killed when a delivery van crashed into her mobility scooter as she was leaving a hotel, a coroner heard.

Mary Rawes died three months after being struck by the slow-moving UPS Mercedes Sprint vehicle.

The partially-sighted widow suffered a head injury when her scooter was tossed over in the collision.

Collision: Mary Rawes, 99, died when she was knocked off her mobility scooter by a slow-moving UPS Mercedes van

Invesigation: Coroner Ian Smith said he would write to 109 fellow coroners and wanted to find out whether there was a wider problem with the 'unregulated' vehicles

An inquest into her death heard that Mrs Rawes died from a 'combination of natural causes and an accident'.

A post-mortem examination found that underlying health problems had also contributed to her death after the crash outside the Stonecross Manor Hotel on Milnthorpe Road, Kendal, Cumbria in December 2011.

Mrs Rawes, who lived in Bellingham Road, Kendal, died in March last year, while residing in a local nursing home.

Concern: Mr Smith, South and East Cumbria Coroner, said Mrs Rawes' death was his third inquest involving a mobility scooter

During the inquest into Mrs Rawes' death, the coroner said that he would investigate deaths on mobility scooters on a national level after encountering three such incidents.

Ian Smith, South and East Cumbria Coroner, said he would write to 109 fellow coroners and wanted to find out whether there was a wider problem with the 'unregulated' vehicles.

Mr Smith 
urged mobility scooter users to take ‘extreme care’, pointing out their 
similarity to cars.

He added: 'They give vulnerable people 
enormous independence and can be beneficial, both mentally and 
physically, but there are consequences and people really do need to be 
extremely careful on them.'

Van driver Michael Nugent, who was 
leaving the hotel after making a Christmas delivery, told the inquest: 'I was going slowly. Visibility was pretty poor because of the bushes 
and ‘for sale’ signs.

'I can’t honestly say whether I had stopped or whether I was slowing down at the point of impact.

'I looked left as I approached the
junction, and saw traffic coming from the right and, as I looked left 
again, I felt the bump.'

Police reconstructed the sequence of events before the impact as part of the investigation.

PC Kevin Jackson told the Kendal 
County Hall hearing: 'The conclusion was that I either couldn’t see the 
scooter or it was a very short glimpse of it - and that was with me 
looking for that and nothing else.'

He explained that the scooter was set to its maximum level - around 4mph - at the time of the accident.

Caution: The coroner told the court that mobility scooters can give 'vulnerable people enormous independence' but that people need to be 'extremely careful on them'

Tests showed that at a scooter travelling at that speed, while moving slightly downhill, would have taken two metres to stop.

PC Jackson said Mrs Rawles was 
‘partially sighted or blind’ in her right eye and that a pair of glasses
was found in the basket of the scooter.

Collision investigator PC Richard 
Wiejah said the a pillar in part of the van’s window frame - would have 
‘substantially obscured’ Mr Nugent’s view.

He said that there were points in 
the events leading to the collision that the scooter would have been 
both in and out of his vision.
