A teenage girl was allegedly raped by an 18-year-old at a Keith Urban concert in Boston this weekend amid hundreds of other fans.

The alleged assault took place at the Xfinity Center in Mansfield on Saturday night. The country music gig descended into chaos with 22 fans sent to hospital for intoxication and 50 people held by police on alcohol-related charges. 

Sean Murphy, 18, was charged with sexually assaulting the girl while a large crowd of fans looked on, unaware that an attack was taking place before their eyes.

According to a police report, a concert-goer reported to an officer on the lawn of the venue that she believed a rape had taken place in front of a large crowd.

The woman told the officer she asked the teenage girl involved if the sex was consensual and she allegedly said 'no'.

The woman said she pushed Murphy off the victim. The girl ran off and Murphy, of Roxbury, Massachusetts, also fled into the crowd.

The female victim was reunited with her friends and police apprehended Murphy. 

Fans who witnessed the alleged attack provided police with cellphone footage of what they saw.

One fan described drunk 14- and 15-year-olds vomiting on other concertgoers. Keith Urban himself commented on the wild crowd in a video tweeted out to fans after the concert.

'Gosh, up on the lawn tonight, that was nutso. It was so cool,' he said in the video.

Officials said that 46 people in total received medical treatment, with most suffering from alcohol-related illnesses.

The steady stream of inebriated fans at 
the Xfinity Center required 
ambulances from five nearby towns and by 9pm officials declared a 'mass casualty' incident.

A fan who claimed she attended Saturday's concert commented on SavingCountryMusic.com that she saw one teenager projectile vomiting on the lawn and others so drunk they 'can’t even hold their heads up'.

She blamed security personnel for failing to search people on their way in and for not patrolling the lawn for unruly fans.

Emergency responders were not expecting such a wild night, according to a joint statement from the police and fire departments of Mansfield, located about 30 miles south of Boston.

'Last evening's Keith Urban concert was not anticipated to present with the volume of issues handled,' the statement read.
