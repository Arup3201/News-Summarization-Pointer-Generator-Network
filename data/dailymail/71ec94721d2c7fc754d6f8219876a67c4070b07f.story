Bernie Madoff's daughter-in-law has hit back at claims made by Ruth and Andrew Madoff in their recent '60 Minutes' interview and describes the dramatic change her life has taken since the Ponzi scheme was discovered.

Stephanie Madoff-Mack sits down with Anderson Cooper to 'put right' some of the revelations made by the pair in the revealing interview aired on Sunday.

Stephanie was married to Madoff's son Mark, who was 46 when he committed suicide on the second anniversary of his father's arrest.

Stunned: Stephanie said she was shocked by some of the things they said, particularly that Andrew said he wasn't surprised by his brother's suicide

Reaction: Stephanie sat down with Anderson Cooper to discuss her feelings over some of the revelations made in the '60 Minutes' interview

In love: Stephanie told Anderson that she and her husband were talking about having more children and were absolutely not splitting up

Madoff's wife Ruth revealed in the interview that she and her husband tried to commit suicide together on Christmas Eve by taking all the sleeping tablets they had in the house.

But they simply woke up the next day. Anderson Cooper asks Stephanie what she thought when she learned that.

She said: 'I have no idea what went on in that penthouse that night but for Ruth to talk about trying to kill herself so flippantly like that is so offensive to me because that's how my husband died. 

'Ruth says she was happy that she woke up. I'm happy for Ruth that she woke up but I just wish that my husband had and he didn't.

'Its not a laughing matter. It's not funny. It's what killed my husband.'

Tell-all: Ruth Madoff gave the first interview since her husband's arrest and revealed they had tried to commit suicide

Son: Andrew Madoff said he never suspected his financier father of running a Ponzi scheme because he grew up hearing what a legend he was

Happy times: Stephanie denies Andrew's claims that she was seeking a divorce, saying they were in a 'good spot'

Madoff earlier denied ever having attempted suicide in an interview from prison, where he is serving a 150-year sentence for his record-breaking scam.

But he called the Today Show's Matt Lauer on Sunday night to corroborate Ruth’s account of the pact before he interviewed her on Monday.

Pact: Madoff finally admitted to Matt Lauer that he and his wife did try to commit suicide

Lauer told Ruth: '(Bernie) agrees completely with the way you tell this story. He said he took Ambien, aspirin and some blood-pressure medication. The two of you got into bed that night fully dressed because you suspected your bodies would be found.

'He said he woke up the next day to the sounds of you saying, "I’m alive, I’m alive".'

In the interview, Ruth described finding out about her husband's affair as the 'worst thing that ever happened to her'.

Cooper tells Stephanie that he found this 'stunning', in that her son's suicide wasn't the worst thing.

Looking noticeably annoyed, Stephanie told him: 'I do too. I mean I'm a mother I can't even imagine the pain Ruth must feel about losing a son but to say that the affair was worse. It doesn't make sense to me. She doesn't make sense to me.'

Andrew Madoff, along with his fiancee, has released a book about their experience throughout the trauma saying they wanted to tell their side of the story.

In it, he makes a number of allegations against his late brother Mark, pokes fun at him - calling him a mama's boy - and even alleges that Stephanie was seeing a divorce lawyer days before he hanged himself with a dog leash.

Speaking about the claims made in the book, Stephanie said: 'It is hurtful. I have not read his book 
but I have heard that he does poke fun at Mark and I don't understand 
why.

On the Today Show: Catherine Hooper, left, fiance to Andrew, centre, and Ruth Madoff who went on the show to talk about the book and their life since Madoff confessed

'I also understand he claims that I was planning on leaving Mark, a 
few days before Mark killed himself. That's absolutely not true. Mark 
and I were in a great place that day I went to Disney World and we had 
been a great place through out the fall and winter time. I was getting 
my husband back.

'The anniversary of Bernie's confession was coming up 
and it wasn't even on our radar.  Mark was laughing again, working 
again, we were talking about having more children and to hear that is 
very hurtful and Mark died, I would think he would want to honor him.'

Book: Andrew and his fiancee released the book so that people would 'know the truth' about the scandal

She also revealed to the CNN anchor she believes Ruth's claims that she knew nothing about the Ponzi scheme, saying: 'She's not a monster, she's not a bad person. She just makes foolish choices.'

Despite that, she banned her mother-in-law from coming to Mark's funeral saying she did it for both her husband and children's sake.

'I didn't think Mark would want her at 
the funeral and furthermore I thought the presence of Ruth Madoff would 
cause such a media circus…I really wanted to protect all four of Mark's
children. I wanted it to be as calm and private as possible,' she said.

Ruth
Madoff cut off all ties with her husband after her son's funeral and 
she revealed in '60 Minutes' that she wish she had done it sooner as 
Mark had wanted, blaming herself for his suicide.

Stephanie reveals that after Madoff's 
confession, her family became Mark's family. He sent emails to his wife,
her mother, brother and stepfather before his death. He didn't send any
goodbye emails to anyone in his family.

She said: 'My family had become his. He felt very abandoned obviously by Ruth. He felt abandoned by his brother.'

Andrew Madoff, who said he was very close to his brother before he died, said he was 'not surprised' that Mark committed suicide, something Stephanie says she 'doesn't understand'.

'Look I was Mark's wife. I lived with him everyday. My husband was in a good spot. He was moving on. I have nothing more to say to that. I just don't agree with Andrew's statement at all.'

The full interview will be aired tomorrow on Anderson.
