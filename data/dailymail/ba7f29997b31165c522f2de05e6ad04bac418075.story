Wearing Lycra has long been considered a crime against fashion.

But cyclist Tim Burton was surprised when he was stopped by police who pulled him over for not sporting the stretchy fabric.

An officer considered Mr Burton’s preferred outfit of scruffy jeans and a t-shirt not to be the attire of a serious cyclist – and thought he must have stolen the high-end  bicycle he was riding.

Pulled over: Tim Burton was accused of stealing his bike when the 
police officer saw that he wasn't wearing expensive cycling clothes

PC Keith James, of Avon and Somerset 
Police, explained that because Mr Burton was not clad in Lycra or 
wearing a cycling helmet, he was likely to have pinched the £500 bike.

But after checking the serial number on the bicycle which confirmed it did belong to Mr Burton, the officer sent him on his way.

The 25-year-old cyclist then Tweeted a
picture of the incident in Keynsham, Somerset, writing: ‘Just got 
stopped by the police for ‘‘not wearing Lycra’’ but being on a road 
bike. He says I wasn’t dressed in appropriate gear for riding my bike so
I had stolen it.’

He went on: ‘I was clipped in. No scruffy trainers but clean(ish) shoes.

‘Maybe I did not look hipster enough?
Apparently there have been some shed break-ins locally. The bike looks 
too good for me to own, obviously!

‘It is nice to see them looking out for pinched bikes, I told the policeman I appreciated it.’

Lycra: Because Tim wasn't wearing expensive cycling clothing, the police officer assumed that he was not the owner of the bike

Explaining his actions PC James later
said: ‘Bike thefts are a priority for us in this area as we’ve had a 
number of garage and shed break-ins.

‘I’m a cyclist myself and it was 
unusual to see an expensive bike being ridden by someone in non-cycling 
clothes and without a helmet.’

He continued: ‘It soon became clear 
that Mr Burton was the genuine owner and I’m glad he’s supportive of 
what we’re doing to try to catch bike thieves.’

Mr Burton later told his followers on
Twitter that he found the experience amusing, writing: ‘I thanked them 
for stopping me. I was just amused at the reasoning being that I wasn’t 
Lycra-clad.

‘I don’t think it needs a complaint against @ASPolice. I’m not wearing normal attire and it probably looked dodgy.’

He added: ‘It’s fair enough. I’m not 
saying they were wrong. It’s amusing that I’ve been stopped for no 
Lycra. Jeans and a tee are so last season.’ Lycra is a relative newcomer
to the textile scene, having been invented in 1959 by chemists at Du 
Pont in Virginia.

It was marketed under the trademark 
Spandex – a play on the words ‘it expands’ and quickly became essential 
cycling gear. Its association with the sport has resulted in the 
nickname ‘Lycra Louts’ for aggressive cyclists.

Portly weekend riders have popularised the acronym ‘MAMIL’ – Middle Aged Man in Lycra, a common sight on Britain’s roads.
