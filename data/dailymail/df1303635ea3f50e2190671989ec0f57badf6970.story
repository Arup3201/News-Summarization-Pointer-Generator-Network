With his arms outstretched in shock, this is the moment a man suspected of being smuggled into the UK was pounced upon by border agency officials.

The man was staying in east London when officers from the UK Border Agency ( UKBA) raided his accommodation as part of a crackdown on gangs bringing illegal immigrants into the UK.

More than 150 officers from the agency took part in the operation today which was carried out across the UK ,France and Belgium.

Crackdown: Dozens of raids were carried out across the UK today in a crackdown on gangs who bring illegal immigrants into the UK. This man in east London is suspected of being smuggled into the country

Probe: More than 150 officers from the UK Border Agency took part in the operation today

The raids took place after it emerged that people smugglers are paying luxury yacht owners to sneak illegal immigrants into the UK.

Gang
leaders are offering people with expensive boats huge rewards to enter 
British ports carrying desperate stowaway foreigners.

It marks a new tactic away from the traditional method of illegal immigrants being smuggled into the UK on board HGV lorries and ferries bound for Dover.

UKBA officers raided 35 addresses in England and Scotland while another 40 
raids were carried out at the same time in France and Belgium.

Action: Raids were carried out in London, Hampshire, Peterborough, Birmingham, Coventry, Smethwick, Leamington Spa and Stoke-on-Trent

Tough approach: A total of 35 addresses were raided across England and Scotland today

A total of 26 people were arrested following the raids, which took place in a number of towns and cities throughout the UK.

The stowaways pay from £2,000 to £6,000 per person to be smuggled into Britain.

Raids were carried out in London, Hampshire, Peterborough, Birmingham, Coventry, Smethwick, Leamington Spa, and Stoke-on-Trent.

Warrants were also executed in Manchester, Sheffield, Lancashire and Glasgow.

It is understood many of the immigrants who pay the gangs are from Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan.

So
far, officers have made 20 arrests in relation to their investigation 
and another six in relation to other suspected offences including 
immigration breaches.

Identity: The Border Agency officials used this machine to take the fingerprints of a man suspected of being smuggled into the country

Chris Foster from UKBA said: 'We 
believe this to be one of the biggest operations of its kind ever 
undertaken in the UK, involving officers the length and breadth of the 
country.

'My officers have 
been working closely with their counterparts in France and Belgium as 
well as other law enforcement agencies in the UK in the build-up to 
today’s operation.

'We 
believe we have successfully disrupted a significant organised network 
suspected of being involved in a systematic attempt to evade the UK’s 
immigration controls.

'Our investigation will continue with the evidence we have seized today.'

Immigration
Minister, Mark Harper, said: 'The organised criminal gangs involved in 
people-smuggling prey on the desperation of others in order to line 
their own pockets. They are also a major factor involved in illegal 
immigration to the UK.'

The 20 men arrested in connection with the investigation included nine aged 19 to 33 who were held in London in Stockwell, Wood Green, Peckham, Southall, Manor Park, Peckham, East Ham, South Croydon and Harrow.

Another four aged 18 to 33 were arrested in the Midlands in Smethwick, Birmingham and Coventry; and three aged 20, 21 and 25 were held in Peterborough.

The remaining arrests were of a 38-year-old in Manchester, a 27-year-old in Leigh, Lancashire, a 36-year-old in Sheffield and a 31-year-old in Fareham, Hampshire.

The other six not relating to the investigation were five men who were held on suspicion of immigration offences in Manor Park, east London, Southall, west London, and Palmers Green, north London.

The sixth was a man who was arrested for ID card offences in Southsea, Hampshire.

People smugglers are paying luxury yacht owners large sums of money to sneak illegal immigrants into the UK, it emerged today.

Speaking today, border agency 
officials said yacht owners are being approached by smugglers because 
their vessels face less rigorous checks by border officials when they 
enter UK waters.

Stowaways: People smugglers are paying yacht owners large sums of money to sneak illegal immigrants into the UK. Brittany, pictured, is one area in which yacht owners are being targeted

Illegal immigrants have traditionally tried to smuggle into the UK on board HGV lorries and ferries bound for Dover.

But officials in France say 
mobsters are now targeting yacht owners in the Brittany area and bribing
them with huge sums to take immigrants into less guarded UK harbours.

The
new menace to Britain's borders was revealed by French customs officers
who found 15 Albanian migrants huddled in the cabin of a £100,000 yacht
on January 12.

Officials 
in Cherbourg were carrying out a routine check on the yacht, based in 
Brittany, which was heading north across the Channel towards the 
Westcountry.

The luxury 
boat's two French skippers told a judge Kosovan gangsters paid them to 
transport migrants on regular trips across the channel.

Police
were told the immigrants, who had no identification or paperwork, each 
paid 1,000 Euros on the promise of a new life in Britain.

The two sailors are currently in custody in France awaiting trial for smuggling.

A French border official said: 'In 2012 they transited 30 foreigners without papers on two yachts, making five trips to the UK.'

Border
officials in France say a 'turf' war between people smugglers from 
Afghanistan, Egypt and Albania have seen them targeting new potential 
ways into Britain - including posh yachts.

Investigators
have begun probing a gang using ports on the north coast of Brittany - 
where controls are less frequent than at Calais, Boulogne and Dunkirk.

A
Home Office spokesman said: 'People smuggling is an international crime
and we are working closely with our counterparts in France on this 
operation.

'In the last financial year 9,000 individual attempts to cross the Channel illegally were prevented.

'We
also have a fleet of cutters protecting the UK from any criminal 
sea-borne threat and people attempting to evade our border controls.'
