Brutal: John Davis, pictured, was binge drinking with friends the night before his vicious attack on his three-week-old son, who was left with cerebral palsy

A father who battered his three-week-old baby boy so badly he was left with cerebral palsy has been jailed for eight years.

John Davis, 30, had spent the night before the savage attack binge drinking vodka with two friends to celebrate the birth of his son.

The next morning Davis offered to give the baby his morning feed as his mother lay in bed but instead subjected him to an horrific attack at their home in Herne Bay, Kent.

The defenceless baby needed his skull reconstructed after suffering severe head injuries, five broken ribs, bleeding to his brain and a broken collarbone.

He was rushed to hospital and twice stopped breathing on the way and paramedics had to bring him back to life.

A court heard that the child, now 15 months old, was left with life-changing injuries including cerebral palsy.

Davis, who has repeatedly refused to say how he inflicted the injuries, initially refused to admit his guilt.

As a result the baby’s mother found herself under suspicion and was arrested and not allowed to see her son again until he was eight months old.

Davis eventually admitted grievous bodily harm and a jury heard how two years ago he narrowly avoided prison for dangling another child from a balcony.

He was jailed for eight years at Canterbury Crown Court. Sentencing Davis last week, Judge Heather Norton said:

'This was an extremely serious offence. It is difficult for anyone to understand how an adult can cause injuries and treat a tiny vulnerable baby in the way that you did.

'I have received statements and a letter from you which speak of how good you are with children and how people trust you with children.

'How that side of your personality can be reconciled with what you did is very hard to understand. It does seem that there are two sides of you.'

The judge added: 'Although having development problems, it is not possible to say what the final outcome will be for the baby.

Jailed: John Daivs has repeatedly refused to say how he inflicted the life-changing injuries on his newborn son. He initially refused to admit his guilt and the baby's mother found herself under suspicion as a result

'But he appears to be moving in the right direction and that is extremely encouraging.'

After the case the baby’s mother, who now lives near Canterbury and cannot be named to protect her child’s identity, said: 'In a period of time Davis will be released and he will go back to his life.

'But my baby will be a victim of what he did, not just for a few years, but for the rest of his life.'
