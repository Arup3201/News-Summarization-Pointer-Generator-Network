She has been adamant in the past that she would only lose weight if it affected her health or her love life.

But pop star Adele looked decidedly slimmer when she tweeted a photograph of herself yesterday drinking a cup of tea.

Talent: Adele with her Oscar for James Bond theme Skyfall

The 25-year-old chart-topper is also 
more used to being snapped in glamorous stage outfits, but was happy to 
pose without make-up.

Adele, whose hits include Rolling In The Deep and Rumour Has It, tweeted the photo to her 20â€‰million Twitter followers as part of World Water Day.

The star, who won an Oscar last year for the James Bond theme tune Skyfall, usually guards her family life jealously, but used the occasion to also post an image of her 17-month-old son Angelo as well as one of a tap and one of a fish bowl.

She urged fans: â€˜Everyone tweet a picture of yourself with water! Drinking, showering, cooking, cleaning.â€™

World Water Day is a cause close to her heart because her partner Simon Konecki is chief executive of the charity Drop4Drop, which organised the event.

The charity works to improve access to clean drinking water in the developing world.

Hollywood actress Gwyneth Paltrow, Robbie Williams, Stephen Fry, Jessie J and Rita Ora were among those who posted snaps to mark the event.
