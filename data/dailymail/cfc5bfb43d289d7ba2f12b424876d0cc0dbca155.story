Residents in a Detroit neighborhood have been living in fear of a large cat that has been wandering around hissing at children. Today, that cat was found shot to death and thrown in a dumpster.

The cat - a 25-pound, 3-year-old Savannah cat named Chum - was found in a dumpster on the east side of the city on Monday night.

Authorities suspect a neighbor near Joann and Bringard streets shot the cat several days ago - as a feral-cat rescue group was searching for the animal that had residents in fear for the last month.

Savannah cats are domestic cats bred with an African Serval cats. Depending on how far down the breeding chain they are, they can 
be fairly wild.

'I think people can’t just go around shooting things 
they don’t understand,' Laura Wilhelm-Bruzek, the founder of the cat rescue group Paws for the Cause, told the Detroit Free Press. 'I think we need to 
be a little bit more respectful of the animals and human beings around 
us. I’d love to see someone look into it and investigate it. But I’m not
holding out a lot of hope. This whole thing from the beginning has just
been a mess.'

Wilhelm-Bruzek's group started searching for the cat on Saturday.

Savannah cats are a cross between a regular house cat and a long-eared African Serval cat. The cats became popular amongst breeders in the late 1990s and by 2001, the International Cat Association accepted it as a registered breed. Savannah cats are more social than an average cat and are often compared to dogs - they can be taught to walk on a leash and can even play fetch. The Serval cat is native to southeast Africa, where it hunts fish, birds and rabbits. It also can take down animals as big a deer or gazelle. Serval cats numbers have dwindled in recent years, as people often hunt them for their pelts. They also are prey for leopards and other large cats.

Residents in the neighborhood first started seeing the large cat last month. They described it as being four feet tall and being gray with black spots.

'He 
walked like he ain't scared of nothing,' said resident Antwaun Ansberry. 'This thing is out here, bro.'

Residents in the neighborhood said they called the Michigan Humane Society and the Detroit Police Department but that both agencies declined to investigate.

Last week, the cats' owners called Paws for a Cause to help them find Chum. The group heard that the cat had been shot, but couldn't recover the body until yesterday, when someone showed them where it was.

'I simply asked them for the cat’s body and they said
it was across the street in a garbage can,” Wilhelm-Bruzek said. She was walked 
to the garbage can, 'and the cat — whose name is Chum — was there.'

Chum's owners, who raised the cat since it was four months old, were heartbroken when they found out the cat had been shot.

'They were hysterical,” Wilhelm-Bruzek said.

She added that the family planned to have the cat cremated today.
