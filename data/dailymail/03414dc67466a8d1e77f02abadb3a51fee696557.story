Nick Clegg last night joined calls for Shaker Aamer to be returned to Britain from Guantanamo Bay.

The Deputy Prime Minister said the father of four should be released after nearly 13 years in high security detention.

He insisted Mr Aamer should not be left in ‘infinite legal limbo’ without trial and instead face a proper judicial process.

The Lib Dem leader’s comments came after the Daily Mail published a letter signed by celebrities, civil rights campaigners and politicians calling on David Cameron to increase pressure on the United States to free Mr Aamer.

Yesterday more lent their names to the letter. They include the Love Actually actor Bill Nighy, Amnesty director Kate Allen and four MPs, including former Tory minister Sir Alan Duncan and former Labour frontbencher Diane Abbott. The letter was also signed by Natalie Bennett, the Green party leader.

From the arts, new signatories include film director Ken Loach, singer-songwriter Charlie Winston, the playwright David Hare and the author Jeanette Winterson.

The poet laureate, Carol Ann Duffy, and her predecessor Andrew Motion, have also signed the letter as has Susie Orbach, the psychotherapist and writer.

Mr Clegg made his comments at his regular monthly press conference in central London. Asked if Mr Aamer should be released he said: ‘Yes of course Shaker Aamer should be returned.

‘It’s a point we have made at all levels of government repeatedly to the Americans. At the end of the day if people must face justice, they must face justice, but not be suspended in this infinite legal limbo.

‘That is why we have made the case as repeatedly as we have, that given he is a British citizen, that we want to see him released from Guantanamo Bay and if necessary dealt with through the proper judicial process outside Guantanamo Bay.’

Sources close to the Deputy Prime Minister said the Government was making every effort to secure Mr Aamer’s release and had raised the issue repeatedly with the US government.

Mr Aamer is resident in Britain legally, is married to a Briton and has four British children. He has been held in the infamous detention facility for more than a decade without being tried.

The renewed focus on his case came after the explosive Senate report into CIA use of torture during the so-called ‘War on Terror’.

According to his family, who live in Battersea, South London, the 46-year-old wants to stand trial over allegations he is a terrorist with close links to Osama Bin Laden.

His lawyers allege there is a more sinister reason behind his continued detention – that officials fear he could expose evidence of torture carried out in the presence of British intelligence officers.

Downing Street insists that the Government continues to press for a resolution to the case at the ‘highest levels’.

Mr Aamer has been cleared for release twice, first in 2007 under George W Bush, and two years later by his successor Barack Obama.

But his detention has been extended again and again because officials insist he must go back to Saudi Arabia, where he was born, rather than home to Britain.

He was detained in Kabul, Afghanistan, in 2001, and handed to US forces, who allegedly tortured him at a secret ‘black site’ prison.

The letter calls on David Cameron to ‘pick up the phone to President Obama, and bring Shaker Aamer home’. It is being organised by the We Stand With Shaker campaign and has been signed by MPs from across the political spectrum.

The letter says Mr Aamer’s continued detention without charge or trial is ‘in violation of the right not to be arbitrarily imprisoned that was enshrined in Magna Carta’.

n The US government could this week be forced to make public thousands of photos of its soldiers abusing detainees in Iraq and Afghanistan.

A legal challenge is being mounted to ensure the release of the 2,100 images which reportedly include troops posing for ‘trophy’ photos with dead bodies.

The photos, dating between 2001 and 2005, are said to show female soldiers with hooded, shackled prisoners who were stripped naked. Other images depict hooded prisoners on transport planes with Playboy magazines opened to pictures of nude women on their laps.

Others show US soldiers threatening sexual violence.
