An Ohio boy with brain cancer died yesterday - just two weeks after he had arrived home from hospital for an early Christmas.

A family friend in Port Clinton says 13-year-old Devin Kohlman died Monday afternoon.

Doctors had told Devin's family that he didn't have long to live, so the city along Lake Erie spent the last few weeks trying to fulfill his wish of being home for his favorite holiday.

Last wish: 13-year-old Devin Kohlman was dying of brain cancer but had been able to celebrate his last Christmas two months early - after his entire town joined together to bring him a festive celebration

Early Christmas: Residents of Port Clinton, Ohio, leaped into action after learning Devin was coming home from hospital having been given the terminal diagnosis

Big turn out: Hundreds of residents wore red and green, sang Christmas carols and decorated their homes with lights for Devin Kohlman

The city put up a Christmas tree 
within view of the family's apartment and tons of shaved ice shaped 
drifting snow outside his window. Santa even showed up on a motorcycle.

Family and friends gathered for a vigil last night after his death while an early-season snow fell over the city.

In late October, Devlin returned from a Cincinnati hospital and was greeted by hundreds of well-wishers wearing red and green and singing Christmas carols

A
local Wal-Mart donated Christmas presents while Christmas trees and 
snowmen were dotted around outside the home of the teenager.

The youngster's family had been told he had weeks to live after chemotherapy to fight an aggressive brain cancer failed.

Season's greetings: The celebrations began with a welcome home parade for the teen while Christmas trees and festive lights were put up opposite his bedroom window

Festive cheer: It might have been Halloween but in one Ohio town, it was Christmas

Arriving in style: Santa's sleigh was not ready so he had to come to town on a motorcycle

Port Clinton Mayor Vincent Leone said as many as 60 people joined in to help stage Christmas in October. The gesture delighted Devin's parents.

His mother Alexis said at the time: 'We want Devin to have the best Christmas that he's ever had. And we want to make sure that he has Christmas.

'I've never seen anything like it. We're really thankful. But it's for Devin. It's not for us.'

The
celebrations began with a welcome home parade for the teen while 
Christmas trees and festive lights were put up opposite his bedroom 
window.

Alexis Kohlman’s apartment has a bay window, which had enough room for Devin’s hospital bed to be situated so he could see the street.

Then the sound of Santa and an elf, along with 
several other members of the Lost Riders motorcycle club, came to join 
the party, which Devin said made him happy, according to the Port Clinton News Herald.

'We decided at 10 o'clock this morning that we wanted to decorate this and make something special... 
and within an hour we had probably 50-60 people here bringing 
decorations, plus what the city had,' said Port Clinton Mayor Vincent 
Leone.

Devin had battled cancer for a year.

Bucket list: Throughout Devin's illness he had been able to do a number of things to help cheer him up
