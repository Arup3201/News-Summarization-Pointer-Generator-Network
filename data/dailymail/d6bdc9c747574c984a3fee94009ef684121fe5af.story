With a smile and a jaunty wave, Prince Philip left hospital three days early yesterday.

He walked unaided from the London Clinic, 11 days after he was admitted for exploratory abdominal surgery.

Buckingham Palace had previously said the 92-year-old Duke of Edinburgh would be kept in for two weeks.

But he has been progressing well and doctors ruled him fit to go home early. He shook hands and joked with medical staff as he left the hospital in central London before being driven away to be reunited with the Queen.

Happy to be going home: Prince Philip smiles and waves as he left the London Clinic 11 days after an abdominal operation

Philip was smartly dressed in a double-breasted blazer, but appeared to be wearing white surgical stockings under his loafers.

He was holding a book about the 
British Empire entitled The Crucible Of War: The Seven Years’ War And 
The Fate Of Empire In British North America, 1754-1766.

From his bookmark it appeared the duke was at least three-quarters of the way through its 900 pages.

Philip was in ‘good spirits’ but will take a two-month ‘period of convalescence’, the Palace said.

Initially he will rest at Windsor Castle, and possibly later move to Balmoral in Scotland.

He is expected to resume engagements 
in the autumn. It is the fourth time the duke has needed hospital 
treatment since Christmas 2011, and last week he spent his 92nd birthday
in the London Clinic.

Mystery: The Palace has kept the details of the Prince's operation private but said he was in good spirits and recovering well

Treatment: The Duke was taken to The Clinic in London after being taken ill at a Palace garden party almost a fortnight ago

Looking well: The Duke gripped his book as he said goodbye to staff and then walked in a spritely fashion to a waiting car with a smile on his face

Philip received more than 1,000 cards
from well-wishers during his time at the hospital, and in recent days 
he has been asking for paperwork from his office.

Yesterday the Queen was all smiles as
she took part in the historic Garter Day service at Windsor Castle, 
believed to be the first time Philip has not been at her side for the 
ceremony.

Instead, in the latest sign of the 
monarchy preparing the younger generation to take over, the Queen was 
flanked by Prince Charles and Prince William.

A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: 
'The Duke is in good condition and good spirits. He'll take a period of 
convalescence, of approximately two months.

'The Duke has expressed his thanks 
and appreciation to medical staff at the London Clinic and the many 
members of the public who have sent good wishes.'

The Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry's chauffeur-driven vehicle pulled up outside the hospital around 15 minutes after the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall, so for a period of time the Duke had four members of his family with him at his hospital bedside.

The Duke of Edinburgh had a full house as four of his family members were there at once last Friday

Security was tightened at the hospital as they royals visited the Duke.

Earlier in the day his granddaughters Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie paid him a visit.

Charles and Camilla stayed for just over 35 minutes and left the hospital smiling and looking relaxed.

Once out of hospital the Duke will spend two months convalescing but he is described as progressing well.

Prince Philip, pictured the week before his operation at a Buckingham Palace garden party, spent his 92nd birthday in hospital

The Duke celebrated his 92nd birthday four days ago with a visit from the Queen and the Earl of Wessex.

Prince Charles and Camilla had been Birkhall, their private residence at Balmoral.

Prince Edward was the first member of the Royal Family to visit the Duke last week and said he was doing 'well' after his visit.

His visit lasted 20 minutes and as he left he was asked by the waiting press how his father was and replied: 'Well, thank you'.

The Duke had already received the good wishes of the Prime Minister on his birthday and gun salutes were fired across the UK to mark the milestone.

David Cameron took to Twitter to send a birthday message to Philip: 'Wishing the Duke of Edinburgh a very happy 92nd birthday as he recovers in hospital today.'

The Palace has not revealed what prompted the exploratory surgery but sources said doctors ‘picked something up’ during a routine health check.

The Duke was then admitted to the London  Clinic ahead of Friday's pre-arranged operation a week last Thursday.

The surgery, known as a laparotomy, was performed the next day under general anaesthetic.

He was visited by the royal doctor, Professor John Cunningham, on the Saturday and the results of the operation are expected later.

It is not usual for members of the Royal Family to visit the duke in hospital, because he disliked ‘fuss’.

In 2008 he was admitted for four days with a chest infection but refused to receive any well-wishers.

His eldest grandson Peter Phillips said last week that the family was kept informed but added: ‘He’s one of those people who wouldn’t want you to stop just because he’s gone into hospital.’

Last August he was taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary to be treated for a recurrence of a bladder infection while staying with the Queen at Balmoral.

He was in hospital for six days and was not visited by any members of the Royal Family, following doctors’ orders for the elderly Duke to rest.

As well as recuperating after surgery, it appears Prince Philip has relaxed by reading about 18th century history.

The Duke of Edinburgh today left hospital clutching The Crucible of War: The Seven Years' War and the Fate of Empire in British North America, 1754-1766 under his arm.

The book by Fred Anderson costs at least £50, and looking at his bookmark it appears the Duke is at least three-quarters of the way through its 900 pages.

The book, first published in 2000, tells how during the Seven Years' War, Great Britain decisively eliminated French power north of the Caribbean.

Mr Anderson also says this profoundly changed the political and cultural landscape of North America, as the British influenced the first US President George Washington and others like him. 

Anderson also argues that men like Washington also worked hard to understand Britain's strengths and weaknesses, particularly militarily, which allowed America to successfully battle them and win later.
