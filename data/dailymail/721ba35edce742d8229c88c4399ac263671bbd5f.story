third-grade class.

Amina Kocer-Bowman, eight, was fighting for her life after being shot when a gun brought to a Washington school inside her classmate's backpack discharged.

The girl was in a critical condition in hospital tonight after having surgery on a bullet wound in her stomach, authorities said.

Consequences: The boy appeared in court, supported by his uncle and father, facing charges of shooting a classmate with a handgun he had brought in his backpack

The boy is being held at Kitsap County juvenile detention centre after his bail was set at $50,000 during the preliminary hearing yesterday.

As court officers led the boy away after the hearing, his father hugged him and gave him a kiss while they both cried.Â 

The boy's father, Jason Cochran, said outside the courthouse: 'I just want everyone to know that my kid made a mistake. It was a terrible mistake.

If the bail is met, the boy would be released to his uncle and placed under house arrest. The uncle, Patrick Cochran, is the boy's legal guardian and also sat by his nephew's side in the courthouse.

'He's a good kid. It's all I can say,' said Patrick Cochran. 'I apologize to the family of that girl. I really do.'

He added: 'I just want him back home.'

A capacity hearing will be held in two 
weeks to determine if the charges will ultimately proceed. Under state 
law, children between eight and 12 years old can face charges if a court 
determines the child has the capacity to understand an act is wrong.

Detectives believe the incident at 
Armin Jahr Elementary in Bremerton, near Seattle, was accidental.

Victim: Amina Kocer-Bowman was accidentally shot in the abdomen when the gun that was inside another student's backpack went off and hit her

Critical: Amina's mother was already on her way to pick her daughter up from school when she learned of the shooting, and shortly after that the 8-year-old girl was airlifted to a Seattle Hospital where she had surgery

Authorities say the boy brought a .45-caliber handgun he found at his mother's house to the elementary school in Bremerton on Wednesday, and the weapon discharged from inside his backpack just before classes let out, critically injuring Amina Kocer-Bowman in the abdomen and arm.

Court documents stated that the boy told a classmate five days ago that he was going to bring his 'dad's gun' to school and run away. The gun discharged after the boy slammed his backpack down on a desk, it was reported.

Officials said both the child's mother and father have criminal records.

'I just want everyone to know that my kid made a mistake. It was a terrible mistake.'

Police Lt. Peter Fisher would not discuss whether authorities were investigating any adults in connection with the shooting.

Court documents show Jamie Lee Chaffin, who is listed as the boy's mother, sued his father for failing to pay child support.

In 2005, Ms Chaffin was arrested for possession of meth in Bremerton but pleaded guilty to a drug paraphernalia charge.

She also was convicted of marijuana deliver and forgery.

Patrick Cochran said the boy's grandmother adopted him but she died a year ago and he became the child's legal guardian. He said he lives with the boy's father and the boy's two sisters.

KING-TV reported that her friends and relatives gave a 'thumbs up' signal to reporters as they left the Harborview Medical Center last night.

Dr Eileen Bulger said the girl will likely be in hospital for several weeks and face further surgeries.

She was sedated and on a ventilator but has woken up and interacted with her parents.

Her father, John Bowman, thanked his 
daughter's teacher. He said: 'Had she not administered first aid and 
stopped the bleeding from the gunshot wound, this event would have 
surely been tragic.'

Lori Morsette, a friend of the 
victim's family, said: 'She is a sweet little girl and I don't know what
 to do. I'm trying to be supportive for my friends, I'm trying to be 
there for them.'

The school is in a quiet residential neighborhood about 20 miles west of Seattle, across Puget Sound.

Officers and emergency crews were dispatched to the school around 1.30pm yesterday in response to a call that a student was shot by another pupil.

The school went into lockdown immediately after the shooting, said Bremerton Schools spokeswoman Patty Glaser. Such procedures call for announcements to be made over the school's loudspeakers and for teachers to lock their classrooms, she said. Parents picked up their children later in the afternoon.

Probe: The third-grade boy who allegedly brought the gun into school is being held at a juvenile detention centre on suspicion of illegally possessing a firearm and third-degree assault

Worried: A police officer offers reassurances to a pupil as the investigation into the shooting continues

Emergency: A police officer stands watch by the entrance to Armin Jahr Elementary School in Washington, where eight-year-old Amina Kocer-Bowman was shot when a gun discharged inside a boy's backpack

Armin Jahr Elementary has about 400 students The school has reopened and three counsellors were available to talk to teachers, students and parents.

In the latest scorecard by the Brady Campaign, a national gun control advocacy group, Washington scored no points in the child safety category because the state does not require trigger locks for guns and lacks laws to prevent child access to firearms.

'Washington state is a loosely regulated state when it comes to firearms,' said Gregory Roberts, executive director of Washington Cease Fire, a Brady Campaign affiliate.

Amanda Roth, a staff attorney for the San Francisco-based Legal Community Against Violence, said 27 states and the District of Columbia have some form of firearm child access prevention laws.

Such laws can include requirements to use gun locks and criminal penalties for adults who allow children to get their hands on guns.
