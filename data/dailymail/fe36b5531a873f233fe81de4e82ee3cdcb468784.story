Most brides will spend the months leading up to their wedding trying on dresses and saving up for their dream gown worth thousands of pounds.

But that wasn't the case when Hsin Han tied the knot with her fiance Cai Yuan.

The Chinese couple decided they wouldn't bother with traditional wedding clothes and posed for their bridal album naked.

Scenic setting: Hsin Han and Cai Yuan stripped off for their wedding pictures in the Wulingyuan Scenic Area in China's Hunan Province

The groom said they posed naked because, 'we wanted to show our love for each other and to have something forever capturing us in the bloom of youth'

Movie buffs: The couple chose the area because it inspired the planet Pandora in their favourite film, Avatar

Cai Yuan, 31, and Hsin Han, 29, from China, were inspired by the hit 2009 film Avatar. 

They decided to strip naked for their wedding photographs and have a photo shoot in the Wulingyuan Scenic Area in China's Hunan Province.

The stunning scenery in the area was the inspiration for 'Pandora', the home of the Na'vi people in the Oscar-winning film from James Cameron.

The couple said they wanted to have spectacular wedding photos, and travelled to the region with a team of make-up artists and lighting experts as well as a professional photographer.

Not your average wedding album: A team of make-up artists and lighting experts as well as a professional photographer travelled with the newlyweds to bring their dream to life

The young couple shot their nude wedding photographs in various locations with dramatic backdrops of forest covered mountains and wide, sparkling lakes.

As super fans of the film, which stars Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana and Sigourney Weaver, the couple also decided to transform themselves into the blue Na'vi characters for the next stage of their bridal shoot.

The pair got their accompanying make-up artists to paint them in blue and them posed in various locations around the area, including Baofeng Lake and the South Pillar of Heaven rock which were among the inspirations for the film.

Bold: Cai Yuan said their naked wedding photos 'show that we have nothing to be ashamed of in our love'

Oscar worthy: The couple take to the water and pretend to be Na'vi people in another Avatar-themed picture

Inspiration: A character from Avatar which was a hit in 2009 and will soon have a sequel released

Gone viral: The wedding pictures have been popular on social media

Groom Cai Yuan explained why they chose such a different way to celebrate tying the knot: 'We wanted to show our love for each other and to have something forever capturing us in the bloom of youth. 

'And we wanted to make it a bold statement, to show that we have nothing to be ashamed of in that love.'

The wedding pictures have been a hit on social media even though the pair could find themselves arrested as public nudity is illegal and generally regarded as socially unacceptable in China.
