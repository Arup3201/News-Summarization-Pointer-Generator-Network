A man cleared of murdering two soldiers In Northern Ireland has claimed his DNA was planted in the getaway car.

Colin Duffy, 44, said the charges against him were ‘spurious’ but refused to condemn dissident republicans. It is the third time he has beaten terror charges in 20 years.

He was acquitted of shooting Sappers Patrick Azimkar, 21, and Mark Quinsey, 23, as they collected pizza at the gates of Massereene barracks in Antrim.

Cleared: Colin Duffy, who was cleared of a separate murder charge 20 years ago, was acquitted of the same charges as Shivers

Duffy, 44, first hit the headlines 20 years ago after he was cleared of an IRA murder.

Co-accused Brian Shivers was yesterday convicted of murdering the two sappers outside Massereene army barracks in March 2009.

The trial judge said there was a 'strong
suspicion' Duffy, 44, was involved in the Real IRA plot to kill the 
servicemen in March 2009.

Even though his DNA was found on a seat buckle and the tip of a latex glove found in the getaway car there was not enough evidence to convict him of taking part in the 'murderous attack'.

But today, he told a news conference: ‘I am firmly of the view that my DNA arose there because it was planted. I was never in that car.

‘I state quite categorically here that I had no involvement in what happened at Massereene, no involvement whatsoever, and that has been vindicated in court because there was no credible evidence to suggest otherwise.’

Asked about republican violence, he said: 'This is a legacy issue here in relation to what has taken place in Ireland in a historic context and far be it for me to be the person who can end all of this armed struggle and all the rest of it, these are issues for these particular groups out there.'

He added: 'I am not into condemning these groups or anything like that because I don't believe there is any value in that. I do not support them either but I am not into the politics of condemnation.'

Duffy said hostility from families of the dead Sappers came after they had been fed information by the 'forces of the state'.

'They are feeding them tittle tattle and rumour and innuendo.'

The soldiers' families broke down in court as Duffy, who has long-standing connections with terror groups in Ulster, walked free.

In 1996 the Court of Appeal quashed the Lurgan republican's conviction and life sentence for murdering a former UDR soldier John Lyness.

He had spent three years in custody, almost the same length of time he has been on remand over the Massereene murders.

A year later he had charges of killing two policemen, John Graham and David Johnston, dropped due to insufficient evidence before any trial.

Despite the 
Rosemary Nelson Inquiry hearing a police claim Duffy was a driving force in 
the north Armagh IRA, he denied ever having been a member and claimed 
that he had been persecuted by the police.

Before his release, Duffy had been on remand in 
Maghaberry prison where he has been on a no-wash dirty protest against 
his continued incarceration.

Terminally-ill Brian Shivers was 
found guilty of murdering Sapper Azimkar, from London, and Sapper 
Quinsey, from Birmingham, just hours before they were due to deploy to 
Afghanistan with 38 Engineer Regiment.

Shivers,
a drinker and gambler who suffers from cystic fibrosis, was also found 
guilty of six counts of attempted murder and one of possession of 
firearms and ammunition with intent to endanger life by Judge Anthony 
Hart after a six-week trial without a jury. He was sentenced to life in 
prison.

The Real IRA, a Republican splinter 
group opposed to the  peace process, claimed responsibility for the 
ambush, which left four others injured.

Mr Justice Hart said Shivers, 46, had invented an alibi for his 
movements on the night of the murders by claiming he had a Chinese meal 
and attended Catholic mass.

But his DNA was found on struck matchsticks recovered from the back seat
of the partially burned-out Vauxhall Cavalier used in the attack.

It 
had been dumped and torched eight miles from the scene in a bid to cover
the gunmen’s tracks.

Doctors have given Shivers, from Magharafelt in County Londonderry, 
between three and four years to live so he is likely to die behind bars.

Duffy, from Lurgan, County Armagh, refused to give evidence. He was 
acquitted of the same catalogue of charges.

Mr Justice Hart, sitting at Antrim Crown Court, said the prosecution had failed to link the defendant to the murder plot.

He said: ‘There must be strong suspicion Duffy did know what was going 
to happen. However suspicion, no matter how strong, is not sufficient to
establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

‘I consider there is insufficient evidence to satisfy me beyond 
reasonable doubt that whatever Duffy may have done when he wore the 
latex glove, or touched the seatbelt buckle, meant that he was preparing
the car in some way for this murderous attack.’

Sapper Azimkar’s mother Geraldine, 58, said: ‘This was a terrible crime.
Losing Patrick has devastated our family and cast a dark shadow over 
our lives.’

Sapper Quinsey’s sister Jaime said the murders were a ‘vicious, cowardly
act’ and said: ‘We have come a little closer to justice.’

Another prominent republican is to be tried in connection with the Massereene murders, while police suspect at least one more person was involved.

Old Bailey bomber Marian Price has been charged with providing property for the purposes of terrorism and earlier this week a judge ruled there was a prima facie case against her as he returned her for trial.

The 57-year-old former IRA hunger striker, who along with her sister Dolours was jailed in 1973 for her role in a republican bombing campaign in London, allegedly provided a mobile phone for the Massereene murder gang.

And police also believe one member of that gang was a son of self-confessed republican killer Dominic McGlinchey.

The claim that one of his sons drove the getaway car used in the gun attack was made by a defence barrister during the six-week trial of Colin Duffy and Brian Shivers.

Barry MacDonald QC, representing Duffy, told the court: 'Police hold reliable information to indicate that a son of Dominic McGlinchey Snr was the driver of the vehicle which was subsequently recovered by police and was used in the fatal shooting of two soldiers in Antrim on March 7 2009.'

Dominic McGlinchey Jnr, 34, and Declan McGlinchey, 35, were both arrested and questioned by police investigating the murders but neither was charged.

McGlinchey Jnr has denied the criminal allegations made against him during the trial and has indicated his intention to make formal complaints to the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Police Ombudsman over the references about him made in open court.

His father, Dominic Snr, was a notorious member of republican splinter group the Irish National Liberation Army.
