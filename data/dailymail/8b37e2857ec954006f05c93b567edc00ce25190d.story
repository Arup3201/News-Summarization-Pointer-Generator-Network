TV and radio presenter Glenn Wheeler has woken from an induced coma after being struck on his scooter by a van on the way to work three weeks ago.

Wheeler's family released a statement on Thursday saying that the 2GB and Channel 7 presenter was in the 'very early and delicate stages of resting his brain and other injuries' after coming out of the coma over the weekend.

'He continues to show signs that he's with us and at times we feel he hasn't lost his sense of humour', the statement said of the 54-year-old who has always been known for his fun-loving attitude.

The breakfast radio host was knocked off his scooter on his way to work at the radio station by a Mitsubishi Star Wagon at the intersection of Woolooware Road and Caronia Avenue, in Sydney's south, about 4pm on January 31.

The Morning Show presenter suffered serious head and internal injuries and was airlifted by helicopter to hospital where he remained in an induced coma at St George Hospital until last weekend. 

The family has asked for visitors to be patient and considerate of Wheeler's fragile condition.

'We know however that the road to recovery is very long and at times at the request of ICU medical staff, we need to allow him time to rest and therefore need to keep his visitors to a minimum, the statement said.

'Once he has progressed further we of course will encourage those close to him to come and see the great man and spur him on in his recovery.'
