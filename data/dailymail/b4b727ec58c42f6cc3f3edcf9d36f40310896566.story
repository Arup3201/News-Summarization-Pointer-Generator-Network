The NFL has confirmed that the first two International Series games at Wembley next season will kick off in the afternoon.

New York Jets' clash with Miami Dolphins and Buffalo Bills' tie against the Jacksonville Jaguars will both have early kick-off times next October in London.

The Jets and Dolphins will kick-off at 2.30pm local time on October 4, while on October 25 the Bills and Jaguars will start at 1.30pm UK time.

Two of the three International Series games at Wembley next season will kick off in the afternoon

Detroit Lions' game against Atlanta Falcons last October was the first ever afternoon kick-off at Wembley

October 4 - New York Jets vs Miami Dolphins, 2.30pm local time (9.30am ET) 

October 25 - Buffalo Bills vs Jacksonville Jaguars, 1.30pm local time (9.30am ET)

November 1 - Detroit Lions vs Kansas City Chiefs, kick-off time TBC 

A kick-off time for the third and final International Series game in 2015 between Detroit Lions and Kansas City Chiefs is yet to be announced.

The game between Detroit Lions and Atlanta Falcons this season at Wembley was the first ever afternoon kick-off in a change to the usual 6pm local start time.

The 9.30am Eastern time kick-off time for that match in October was the earliest ever start to a regular-season game and created a fourth slot for live programming before the triple header later in the day.
