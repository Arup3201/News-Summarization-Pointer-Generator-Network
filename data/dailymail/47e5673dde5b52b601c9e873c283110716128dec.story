Helen Corbett flung boiling water at her boyfriend's groin during a row when she accused him of sleeping with her 24-year-old daughter Crystal

A mother threw a kettle of boiling water at her boyfriend’s groin after accusing him of having an affair - with her daughter.

Helen Corbett, of Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, missed 46-year-old Peter Bailey’s genitals with the searing liquid but caused serious burns to his thighs which left his skin peeling off.

Newcastle Crown Court heard the 45-year-old mother had heard rumours Mr Bailey was sleeping with her 24-year-old daughter Crystal.

Prosecutor Neil Pallister told the court: 'The defendant was angry with him because she believed he had slept with her 24-year-old daughter Crystal.

'He doesn’t say whether or not that was the case. He was in the doorway, she was shouting at him "have you slept with my daughter".

'He heard the kettle click.

'She said "I will show you how mad I am", picked up the kettle, and threw boiling water towards him.

'He recalls she was aiming for his groin.'

The court heard Mr Bailey suffered a large burn to his left thigh, which he reported to the police a few days later.

Mr Pallister said: 'Officers described the skin having peeled off and there were clearly scalds or burns.'

The court heard he needed nurses at the house twice per week to change his dressings.

In a victim impact statement Mr Bailey said: 'I cannot believe what Helen did to me.

'Since the incident I have been in a great deal of pain, I have struggled to sleep, I have flashbacks of what she did.

'I loved Helen, although we had our ups and downs. I didn’t expect her to do that to me.

'Helen hurt me, both physically and emotionally. Every time I see my scar I think about what she did.

'It will be a lifelong reminder.'

Corbett, formerly of Birtley, Gateshead, admitted causing grievous bodily harm.

Sue Hirst, defending, said Corbett met Mr Bailey after her partner died in 2011.

Newcastle Crown Court heard Mr Bailey has embarked upon, or did embark upon, a relationship with her daughter for some weeks after she went into custody

Miss Hirst said: 'In the weeks leading up to this she became concerned about Mr Bailey’s behaviour around her daughter.

'Whatever the reality of it in the lead up to this incident, that was her suspicion and that is what she was questioning him about on the day this incident occurred.

'She asks him if something had been going on, he denied it, she accepts she lost her temper and threw the water at him.

'While she has been in custody Mr Bailey has embarked upon, or did embark upon, a relationship with her daughter for some weeks. 

'It is no longer happening, but there was clearly a huge amount of distress for Miss Corbett to be in that position.'

The court heard Corbett has spent five months behind bars on remand. Judge John Evans granted her bail to live at an address in Sunderland so she can be assessed for an alcohol treatment programme.

Corbett said from the dock: 'I have learned by being in prison.'

She will be back in court to be sentenced on August 19.

Judge Evans told her: 'This was a serious offence, it did cause serious injury and whatever the history, what you did could never be justified, I think you know that.'
