Dale Cregan, pictured, is wanted in relation to the murder of Mark Short - police are urging him to hand himself in after a man was killed at a house in Clayton, Manchester

A one-eyed man is at the centre of a manhunt after a grieving father was brutally executed just weeks after his son was shot dead.

Last night police issued a photograph of Dale Cregan, 29, who is wanted for questioning in connection with both murders.

David Short, 47, was gunned down at his terraced home in Clayton, Manchester, after branding as 'cowards' the killers of his 23-year-old son Mark.

There was an explosion at the house caused by a grenade and within minutes there was another grenade attack and shots reportedly fired at a property in Droylsden, east of the city.

Today a 31-year-old man was in custody after being arrested on suspicion of Mark's murder and three counts of attempt murder. He was held at Wythenshawe Hospital on Wednesday.

The shooting and grenade attacks happened as two men appeared in court charged with Mark's murder. He was blasted to death 10 weeks ago while playing pool with his friends in a crowded pub.

Yesterday his father was shot dead by two masked men just yards from where children were playing in a park.

The gunmen were seen running from the house after neighbours heard shots.

One said: ‘There were between five and eight shots fired – the last couple were really loud. I looked out of my window and saw two men running off  - all masked up.'

Extra police, including armed response officers, were sent to both areas.

Emergency services, including an Army bomb disposal unit were deployed to two addresses near Manchester after shootings were reported this morning

A white transit van, which is believed to have been involved in both attacks was seized at the scene of the second blast in Luke Road.

A silver Ford Fiesta was later seized on Lord Lane in Failsworth. Both vehicles were checked by Army bomb disposal experts to ensure they were safe for police to recover them.

Yesterday's killing came as Luke 
Livesey, 27, and Damien Gorman, 38, appeared via video link at 
Manchester Crown Court charged with the murder of Mark, an amateur boxer.

The
 father of one, was blasted in the neck and died almost instantly after a
 gunman burst into the busy Cotton Tree pub in Droylsden.

David - known as 'Pops' - and Mark's mother Michelle had publicly condemned their son’s killers as 'cowards' and and told how memories of him 'would live in their hearts forever'.

Their neighbours said a large silver car 
had been spotted parked near the family house on Thursday morning 
with four men inside amid fears they were 'scouting' out the property.

One neighbour said: 'I was in bed and 
woke up to the sound of gun shots. I could just tell from the sound of 
them that they were gun shots.

'It’s
 normally okay round here so it a real shock. We’re 
being told that there’s now a gas leak and everyone has been evacuated 
from their homes. I think when they opened fire they must had hit a gas 
pipe or something.'

Another neighbour added: 'I was going for a paper when I heard five or six loud bangs. Someone said to me, "They’re not fireworks"'.

Assistant Chief Constable Garry 
Shewan, said: 'Tragically, a man has lost his life and our thoughts are 
with his family and friends at this time.

'These
 incidents will understandably cause a lot of anxiety and upset and our 
primary focus is to ensure the safety of those in the local communities 
and the wider public.

'I 
want to reassure everyone that extra officers are being deployed in the 
area, including specialist firearms officers and at this time we do not 
believe there to be a threat to the wider public.

'We
 will have a notable presence in the coming hours and days should anyone
 wish to come and talk to us, either to share any concerns or provide 
any information about what has happened.

'As this has only just happened it would not be right to go into any further detail about what occurred as we simply don’t know.

'What
 we do know is that we have a wealth of experience across the board, 
from local neighbourhood officers to those in specialist roles such as 
firearms and investigations, and we will be doing everything we can to 
get to the bottom of what happened and why.'

It
 is believed Mark Short's hitman had intended to 'kneecap' him in a 
'punishment attack' but allegedly accidentally killed him instead 
because as he fired Mark crouched down at the table and was hit in the 
neck.

Two other pub customers, aged 25 and 
26, suffered gunshot wounds to their leg and a 29-year-old man suffered a
 gunshot wound to his lower back following the attack at 11.50pm on May 
23.

Nearby houses have also been evacuated due to a gas leak apparently caused by the shots

Extras police, including armed officers, have been deployed to both addresses following the double attacks this morning

CCTV footage showed the 
suspects pulling up outside the Cotton Tree, one man getting out of a
 blue Ford Focus car and going inside. It showed the same man walking out about 15 seconds later getting into the car and speeding off 
down Market Street, towards Audenshaw.

The gun involved was thought to be a semi-automatic 9mm pistol and there were 20 people at the bar.

Livesey,
 from Hattersley, and Gorman, from Glossop, were also charged with 
three attempted murders as well as Mark’s murder.

In a statement at the time of his death Mark’s grieving family said: 'Mark was taken away from us by cowards.

'People
 who knew Mark, knew him as a young man with a big heart. He would not 
think twice about helping his family and friends when they were in need.

Police have cordoned off houses at the scenes of both shootings, and some homes have been evacuated due to a gas leak

'He was no angel and it is not a secret he had been in trouble with the police, but that was all in the past. He was a loving son, brother, father and boyfriend to Naomi.

'Mark was only 23-years-old and looking forward to a future with his son, Mark Junior. This has now all been taken away from him. He will be deeply missed by all of his family and friends the only ones that knew him the most.

'His memory will be love in our hearts forever.'

Mark was reported to a be friend of another amateur boxer Johnny Joyce, 21, who bit off the ear of Celebrity Big Brother winner Paddy Doherty during a family feud.

In February 2009, Mark was jailed after he broke a shopkeeper’s jaw while on bail for stealing a car from a 60-year-old man. He got a minimum of two years after admitting robbery and assault causing grievous bodily harm.

But in June last year Appeal Court judges replaced the indefinite sentence with an extended jail term of five years and two years on licence.
