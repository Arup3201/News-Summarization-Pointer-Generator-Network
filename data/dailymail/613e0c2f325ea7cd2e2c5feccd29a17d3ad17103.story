Josh Warrington won the vacant European featherweight title in his home city with a fourth-round TKO of Davide Dieli at the First Direct Arena in Leeds.

Roared on by a boisterous partisan crowd, the unbeaten Warrington knocked his Italian opponent down in the fourth with a straight right before a barrage immediately after prompted the referee to halt the contest.

It was just the 23-year-old's third victory inside the distance in 19 fights and the victory has ensured Warrington is now the British, Commonwealth and European champion.

Warrington admitted keeping his concentration in the midst of such raucous support proved crucial to his hopes of victory.

'That was unbelievable and it's hard not to get carried away but I had to keep my focus and I think that's the difference between being at a championship level and not,' he said.

'Just keep my focus and take that energy off the crowd into the ring.'

As for who he would like to face next, the Yorkshireman added: 'It's all about progression so whoever wants to come over to Leeds, I'll fight anybody.'

His promoter Eddie Hearn was taken aback by the reception Warrington was given, but is keen to keep the pressure of his young charge's shoulders.

'He's 23 years old. That's the thing we have to look at in managing his career now,' said Hearn.

'People will want him to go, go, go, go but sometimes we've just got to rein him in a little bit and make sure he progresses and learns his match properly, because with his position now and his ranking, he can move forward to the world level. There's no rush to do so, the fans here will want him to progress and he will progress.

'We've got something major here.'

Warrington secured the vacant European featherweight title in his home city Leeds against Dieli

Earlier, Ricky Burns got back to winning ways on his light-welterweight debut but was thoroughly unconvincing in a points decision victory over the lightly regarded Alexandre Lepelley.

Burns had lost his last two fights and decided a move up to the 140lbs division would breathe fresh life into his career, but the Scot looked a pale shadow of the fighter that had won world titles in two weight classes.

He dropped his opponent in the opening round but struggled to impose himself after a decent start and although he deserved his victory, a 79-71 scoreline will do little to quieten the doubters who believe the Coatbridge fighter's best days are behind him, despite recording his 37th win from 42 fights.

The 31-year-old, who lost his WBO lightweight title to Terence Crawford before suffering a surprise points decision defeat to Dejan Zlaticanin last time out, was fighting outside of Scotland for the first time since November 2011.

Desperate to impress on his first foray into the light-welterweight division, Burns made a strong start and was by far the busier fighter in the opening round, landing a couple of crisp jabs before felling Lepelley with a hard right near the bell.

He continued to use his superior height and reach advantage to beat Lepelley to the punch although the Frenchman grew steadily stronger as the second round wore on.

It was more of the same in the third as Burns found some success behind his jab but was also guilty of swinging wildly.

The fighters were both looking to land a knockout shot and Lepelley had his best round in the fourth, landing a hard shot that drew gasps from the crowd, but from then on the bout descended into a cagey scrap, with neither fighter really asserting themselves in the closing rounds.

Lepelley (17-2-1, 3KOs) was deducted a point in the seventh for leading with his head but it mattered little to the overall proceedings, with Burns doing enough to win the remaining rounds without landing any significant blows.

Brian Rose also bounced back from his world title defeat with a first-round stoppage against Ignacio Lucero Fraga.

The Blackpool fighter, who was beaten by WBO light-middleweight champion Demetrius Andrade earlier this year, floored his Argentinian opponent three times for a confidence-boosting victory.

Hot prospect Callum Smith continued his rise up the ranks by claiming the 14th win of his professional career with a third-round TKO of Rafael Sosa Pintos.
