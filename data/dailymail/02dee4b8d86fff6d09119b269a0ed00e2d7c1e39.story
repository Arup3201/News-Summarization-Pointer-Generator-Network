In a heartbreaking turn of events that unfolded on social media over the course of two hours, a Washington woman unintentionally live-tweeted the car accident that her own husband was fatally injured in.

Caran Johnson, 41, who goes by the Twitter handle @ScanCouver began tweeting about a two-car collision that occurred on Interstate 205 southbound in Vancouver at around 1.40 pm Pacific time on Wednesday.

However, as she updated her followers on the scene of the accident, the state police scanner enthusiast became increasingly worried when she realized her husband, Craig Johnson, 47, would be traveling home on the same route.

Her tweets quickly became harrowing as the frantic mother wrote that not only was her husband late, but he hadn't answered his phone as she began to suspect the worst - only for her profile to be suddenly updated with the stark words, 'it's him. he died.'

Johnson, 41, a Salmon Creek mother of two and employee of T-Mobile, first heard about the car accident on Interstate 205 southbound moments after the crash over the police scanner on Wednesday afternoon.

Commenting on the notorious stretch of road, Johnson says that she 'hates that section' of the highway because it has 'Too many on ramps, speeders and too few lanes.'

The Columbian's staff photographer, Zachary Kaufman, who was at the scene of the collision and interacted with Johnson from the scene, updated his Twitter profile to say there was 'lots of debris on the roadway'.

Retweeting this breaking news update from local newspaper the Columbian, Johnson announces that one person has died in what is confirmed as a two-car wreck she realizes was 'horrible'.

Retweeting the news that a helicopter had to land to rush the injured to hospital, Johnson begins to fret after around 10 tweets when she finds out that there has been a fatality at the scene.

'I'm trying not to panic, but my husband left work early and he drives 205 to get home. He's not answering his phone,' wrote Johnson to her Twitter feed.

Sharing the news with her almost 1,000 strong following that her husband is also late, Johnson informs them that her husband suffers epilepsy and begins to speculate that his condition may have caused a crash.

Her tweets become desperate after this as she implores her followers 'how long do I wait for him to come home before I call the police?'

First response: Caran Johnson began tweeting to her followers just after 2 pm Pacific time - 5 pm Eastern time

Scanner: In her capacity as a police scanner enthusiast - Caran Johnson lets her followers know that the crash is awful

Horror: Caran Johnson learns that there has been a fatality at the crash scene - although she does not know yet it is her husband

Naturally, Johnson then tells her followers that she has become a 'basketcase' with worry after phoning her husband's work and being told that he left early because he was feeling faint.

As Johnson became more and more frantic online, other Twitter users tried to console her.

In a gut-wrenching moment over one hour after the crash, we are told her two children have come home - although Johnson has no idea where their father is.

Then Johnson goes silent on Twitter for around 35 minutes.

Desperate: Caran tries to contact some of her Twitter sources at the Columbian police department to ask if the car could be her husband's Hyundai

Terror: Caran informs her followers that she is losing her cool amid her total panic at not hearing from her husband Craig

Sinking feeling: Caran still has not heard from her husband, even after calling his cell phone and his work

Hope: Caran even request advice from her followers who have been trying to comfort her

Caran waited no time at all calling the police who ominously told her that they would call her back

Sad: While it is not obvious how Caran was on the other side of a Tweet - this moment has poignancy considering what came next

Heartbreaking: This is the tweet that confirmed Caran's worst fears

Then, two hours after her first tweet, in a stark and matter-of-fact update, Johnson simply informs her followers that her husband, Craig, has indeed been named as the victim of the accident she was live-tweeting only one hour before with the words, 'It's him. He died.'

The Washington State Patrol and Vancouver police confirmed that Craig R.
 Johnson, 47, was killed about 1:40 p.m. when his Hyundai Elantra 
crossed the median and collided with a pickup truck. The truck driver 
survived but was seriously injured.

A woman who was driving the second car involved in the incident was taken to a 
hospital with serious injuries, a broken femur and a collapsed lung.

And in a stunning development that might bring some peace to Caran Johnson in her time of loss, a local woman, April Sturdevant tweeted Ms Johnson in a desperate bid to to pass on 'words of comfort'.

Sturdevant said she had been at the scene of the accident and had been with Mr Johnson during his 'last breath'.

It is not known if Johnson and Sturdevant have spoken since the accident.

Not the end of the story: This Twitter user has come forward to tell Caran that they were with Craig when he died and that he felt no pain

Washington State Patrol spokesman Trooper Will Finn said that at the moment, 'We're not quite sure what's happened yet,' with regards to the crash.

Indeed, Finn revealed to CNN the harrowing series of events that led to Johnson's terrible realization.

He was at the accident scene where her husband, Craig, passed away and to his consternation, Johnson contacted him through Twitter - which the scanner enthusiast has done many times before.

'I may tweet something and she may tweet back. One night we exchanged a recipe for a low carb pizza,' said Finn, who has never met Johnson to CNN.

At 2:20 p.m. PT, Johnson sent a tweet to Finn, '@wspd5pio do you have descriptions of involved vehicles?'

'@ScanCouver sorry. Not yet.,' Finn replied.

'It was terrible,' the spokesman told CNN later.

'Immediately, I went into overdrive mode and I stopped tweeting the whole thing. I didn't want someone to find out over Twitter that their husband passed away. I didn't want her to find out that way. That is a hard thing to go through,' he said.

In the normal course of events, Finn would post a picture of the crash scene, but this time he didn't in case Johnson recognized her husband's Hyundai.

'I feel terrible. I still feel terrible,' Finn said. 'Our hearts go out to the family. This person was a member of our community and we just lost him.'
