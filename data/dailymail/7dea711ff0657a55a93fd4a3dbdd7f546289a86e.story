Sunderland are showing interest in QPR striker Charlie Austin.

The 25-year-old scored 20 goals last season but Rangers have bid for Ajax striker Kolbeinn Sigthorsson and are keen on Norwich striker Gary Hooper.

Burnley have expressed an interest in signing Sunderland misfit Danny Graham. Middlesbrough and Watford have also asked about Graham, 28, who Sunderland are willing to sell for £1m but may even loan out.
