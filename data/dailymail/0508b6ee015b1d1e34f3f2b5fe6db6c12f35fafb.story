Elderly residents have voiced their anger at new plans to turn a shop opposite their retirement flats into a funeral parlour.

Proposals put forward by Adam & Greenwood funeral directors, who currently run their office from Chelmsford, Essex, have been called ‘insensitive’.

Pensioners living at the back of the building in nearby Maldon said they were distressed by the thought of having to see hearses and bodies coming and going in their older years.

Brian Stewart, who lives on the top floor of the retirement block, said: ‘When I look out of my windows, I look directly at this proposed funeral parlour. To think about it is so depressing.

‘My wife died in January and I'm having to get over that. But then to be faced with looking at a funeral home. It's just not on.’

Another resident, who wanted to be anonymous, said: ‘We don't need to see these sort of things in our latter stages of life. We will be facing a constant reminder that our own time might not be that far off.’

A third resident added: ‘It's just totally insensitive. The people who live here don't need to see this. We're just hoping and praying something will be done to make sure this doesn't actually go ahead.’

Ray Ward, 70, who runs Adam & Greenwood funeral directors, said he wished those concerned had spoken to him before he signed up to buy the premises, which used to be a chiropody centre.

He said: ‘The strength of feeling has come as a surprise. It's not as though I'd get a trolley and wheel them across my yard. It would be done with the utmost dignity and respect.

'We don't need to see these sort of things in our latter stages of life. We will be facing a constant reminder that our own time might not be that far off'

'But I wish those people concerned by it had come forward earlier.’

Mr Ward is adamant the parlour will go ahead, because the company has a new contract to provide more out-of-hours funeral services in a larger patch.

He added: ‘We now have to cover three areas, and we have to be there within an hour to collect someone, so we have to be in Maldon. I could only buy a shop, and the only shops in Maldon are in the high street - there weren't many options.

‘Who can see me from their yard was not my first concern, but I understand why people feel that way. If the planners turn me down, I will go to appeal.’
