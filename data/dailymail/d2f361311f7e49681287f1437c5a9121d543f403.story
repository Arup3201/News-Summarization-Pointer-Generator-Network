Jade Morris, 10, was last seen when she was taken Christmas shopping by Brenda Stokes. Police believe they have found her body in bushes

The body of a 10-year-old Las Vegas girl who was last seen with a blackjack dealer accused of slashing her colleague has been found in an undeveloped housing area, police believe.

Jade Morris has been missing for a week after family friend Brenda Stokes offered to take her Christmas shopping. The pair never returned.

That night Stokes allegedly slashed a co-worker in the face with razor blad at the famed Bellagio resort on the Las Vegas strip.

Authorities couldn't immediately confirm that the body found on Thursday belonged to Jade Morris, Las Vegas police homicide Capt. Chris Jones said.

'I can tell you that the likelihood is that this is our victim,' he said. He added that the body belongs to a black girl, and Jade was black.

Coroner Michael Murphy said he expected to make a positive identification Friday.

Stokes is also due to appear in court today on charges relating to the casino attack.

Jade's family last saw her at about 5pm on December 21, when Stokes picked her up for a shopping outing, police said.

Police said Stokes was a trusted friend of the girl's father, and family members have told reporters that the two dated for several years.

Stokes, who also uses the name Brenda Wilson, was arrested later that night after she was accused of slashing her co-worker.

Stokes, 50, is now in jail, and Capt. Jones said she has not cooperated in the investigation of the girl's whereabouts. She even denied collecting the girl from her home.

A passer-by called 911 about noon Thursday, and North Las Vegas police found a girl's body in brush near palm trees in a small traffic circle near Dorrell Lane and North Fifth Street.

The location is a short distance from the northern 215 Beltway and about 10 miles from the downtown Las Vegas outlet mall off Interstate 15 where Stokes was to have taken the girl shopping.

Attempts to reach family members have been unsuccessful.

Stokes had picked up the girl to take her shopping and two hours later returned to another friend the red 2007 Saab sedan that she borrowed for the trip, Capt Jones said.

Later, Stokes got a lift with a friend to the luxury hotel famed for its elaborate fountain displays, where she was arrested after authorities say she attacked a female co-worker, Joyce Rhone, with a razor in each hand as Rhone dealt blackjack about 9:30 p.m.

Rhone, 44, was hospitalised with deep cuts on her face, including one from her ear to the edge of her mouth. A police arrest report said Rhone also had several smaller cuts around her right eye.

Records show that Stokes was being held on $60,000 bail at the Clark County jail on felony battery with a weapon, burglary and mayhem charges that could get her decades in prison.

She told a judge Wednesday that she had not obtained a lawyer. She was due again in Las Vegas Justice Court on Friday morning.

The arrest report says casino video shows Stokes attacking Rhone before a casino patron and security officers intervene.

Officer Marcus Martin said the video is evidence that may be shown by prosecutors in court but will not be made public by police.

Police said Stokes later told investigators that she attacked Rhone over harassing phone calls and an unspecified betrayal that ended their seven-year friendship.

Stokes also told police she visited her doctor last week, seeking to be admitted to a hospital 'due to feeling like she wanted to hurt someone'.

When the family heard that Stokes had been arrested in a vicious knife attack on a fellow card dealer on the casino floor of the Bellagio, they grew concerned for their daughter's well-being.

The girl's father, Philip Morris, who is reportedly engaged to Stokes, had said just days ago he was sure Jade was still alive.

It is unknown how many of the Bellagio's 4,000 guests saw the fight, which occurred in the crowded casino at around 9.45pm, but it came just a week after many witnessed a murder-suicide in a busy hotel lobby on the Las Vegas strip.
