In the small Alaskan town of Whittier, which sees up to 250 inches of snow annually, nearly all of the 218 residents live in one multi-story house.

Surrounded by only mountains and the sea, the remote town is so isolated that it's only accessible by North America's longest one way tunnel, which stretches for two and a half miles.

But the tunnel, which alternates directions every half an hour, closes at 11pm until re-opening at 5:30 the following morning.

In the small town of Whittier, Alaska, nearly all 218 residents live in one single multi-story building

The building, called Begich Tower, houses the town's entire neighborhood, including the local police department, a school, an indoor playground, two convenience stores, a B&B, a laundromat and the post office.

The local church performs baptisms in an inflatable pool in the basement and children can easily knock on their teacher's door for homework help in the evenings.

Filmmaker, Mary Katzke, a fellow Alaskan from Anchorage, was one of the first to take interest in the peculiar small town and its unusual daily realities.

She said: 'This community has always been of interest due to its primary place of residence being one tower - the Begich Tower.

A filmmaker from Anchorage, Alaska, has recently taken interest in developing a project about the town

The building was first constructed by the U.S. Army in the 1950s, but is now under civilian ownership

It is only accessible by a two-and-a-half mile, one-way tunnel, which alternates directions during the day

What makes the town so fascinating is that despite the geographical isolation, families have continual contact

'There is so much geographic isolation yet continual contact via this living set up.

'The residents work for the port, as boat mechanics, or in the city or occasionally drive out to work outside the community.'

There are a few rebels to this particular living arrangement, however, such as Paul, who has opted to live in his 'immobile' motor home.

In the brutal winters, the town may see up to 250 inches of snowfall, but in the summer, it's another story

In the summer, the city sees up to 22 hours of sun a day and about 900,000 tourists who visit via cruise ships

It has long been of interest as a filming location, though recent enquiries are focused on a reality show

One of the rebels to this particular living arrangement is Paul, who resides in an 'immobile' mobile home

Although the town remains quite sleepy during the brutal winter months, in the summer, it's a completely different story.

As many as 900,000 tourists pass through the town from cruise ships during the warmer months, when the town enjoys up to 22 hours of sunlight.

The creation of the 14-story building began in 1953 by the U.S. Army, but came into civilian ownership a few years later when the Army left the town.

Although in the past, the town has been the subject of interest for a big budget film, recent requests have centred more on the potential for a reality show or real-life Neighbours.
