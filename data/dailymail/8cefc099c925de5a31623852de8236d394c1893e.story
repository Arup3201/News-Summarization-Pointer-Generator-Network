A young Georgia teen is undergoing treatment this weekend after he strangled to death a suspected rabid fox that attacked him seemingly out of nowhere on Wednesday.

Ryan Prather, 13, was sitting on a street curb in Douglasville when the fox came from behind him and ferociously latched onto his arm.

In a quick-thinking show of bravery befitting someone far older, Ryan reacted by putting an end to the sickly creature's rampage before anyone else could be hurt.

Out of nowhere: 13-year-old Ryan Prather is undergoing treatment to enure he doesn't develop rabies after a ferocious fox likely infected with the virus latched onto his arm as he sat on a street curb

According to WXIA, Ryan was the second person bitten by a suspiciously aggressive fox in the immediate area in less than two days.

Ryan's attack occurred at 7pm Wednesday. In the predawn hours that morning, another victim was bitten nearby, but the fox got away.

When a fox attacked him, Ryan says it wasn't heroism but an instinctual response that led him to kill the wild animal.

'I looked up and this thing bit me,' he told WXIA. 'I looked at it and it looked like a possum, but it wasn't a possum, it was a fox.'

And a crazed fox at that.

Hero: Prather bravely subdued the crazed animal by strangling it to death. Authorities said it was likely the same fox that had bitten another Douglasville, Georgia resident earlier that day

'It was latched onto my arm and I just grabbed it and choked it and it let go and I just hit it,' he said.

Douglas County Animal Control manager Frances McMillan told WXIA the boy likely saved other residents of the Atlanta suburb from future attacks. even if it took little effort to put the fox out of its misery.

'He was defending himself and the fox died fairly easily,' McMillan. 'It was already in a weakened state.'

Authorities have now sent the fox to be tested for the deadly virus, but Ryan is being treated in the meantime.

'They said it was better to go ahead and get started with the shots than waiting on the test to come back,' Prather told the Douglas County Sentinel.

There are only roughly two human rabies deaths in the United States each year, making the attack the more rare and bizarre.

However, McMillan is urging county residents to be vigilant and to get their pets vaccinated.
