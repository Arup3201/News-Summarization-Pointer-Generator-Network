This is the dramatic moment a mother-of-two opened fire with an assault rifle on intruders who tried to smash their way into her home.

The woman took action after three hooded individuals kicked down the door of her Detroit home on Monday night where she lives with her two young children.

She fired off rounds in a bid to deter the would-be burglars, later saying she 'didn't have time to get scared'.

The teenage intruders fled from the house in Detroit after the shots were fired by the mother protecting two young children

The unnamed mother told WXYZ Detroit: 'I let them know I had a gun once they were in the house and they challenged me and said "no you don't have a gun" so that's when I shot off the first round.

'I wasn't feeling anything at the moment, I got scared afterwards.'

The mother added that her young daughter told her: 'Oh no mommy, I don't want them to take my piggy bank or my toys.'

The incident was caught on tape after the family installed cameras following a similar break-in.

As the intruders fled the home while shots rang out, one dropped a handgun. He grabbed it and tried to get back into the house but was scared off by more shots.

All three suspects are seen running through thick snow from the house. No one was hurt in the incident.

Police arrested three teenage suspects a short time later.

In June last year it was reported that a 10-year-old Brooklyn boy fought off two intruders at his home by picking up a gun and firing a shot after one of the invaders dropped their weapon.

Two people dressed as FedEx delivery men knocked on the door to the house around 5:30pm, the NYPD said.

When two teenage sisters opened it, the intruders pushed past them and went to the second floor, where the boy was in his bedroom.

The boy's mother managed to slam the second-floor door on one of the would-be robber's arms, leading him to drop his gun.

Police say her 10-year-old son then picked up the gun and fired a round.

One of the suspects fired back, but no one was hit and the suspects fled. Nothing was taken from the apartment.
