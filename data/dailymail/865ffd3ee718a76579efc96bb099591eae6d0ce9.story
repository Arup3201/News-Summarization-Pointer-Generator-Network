Tragedy: Emma Bennett, 27, from Leeds, died after being attacked by two dogs, believed to be banned breeds

A 33-year-old man was today arrested on suspicion of owning two illegal American pitbulls that mauled to death a mother-of-four, who may have been pregnant.

Emma Bennett, 27, died yesterday evening in hospital after suffering fatal bites to the neck and head at her home in Dawlish Avenue, Leeds, on Monday afternoon.

This morning Lee Horner was arrested on suspicion of offences under the Dangerous Dogs Act.

It also emerged today that Miss Bennett is believed to have been pregnant at the time of the horrific attack.

Following her death her boyfriend posted on Facebook: 'R.I.P emma and our bump u was deeply loved by all and will sadly be  missed by me and all that knew u know ur with the angels love u u will always be in my heart and on my mind to the day we meet again xx'.

Today her family also paid tribute to the 27-year-old, calling her a 'lively person with a great sense'.

Detective Superintendent Simon Beldon, who is leading the investigation, said: 'Early indications are that the two dogs seized from the address are American  pit bull terriers although tests are still ongoing to establish their exact make up. Dogs of this type are subject to restrictions under the Dangerous Dogs Act and our enquiries are focused on this aspect.

'We are continuing to appeal for anyone with information about the incident or the dogs involved in it to contact the investigation team.'

Miss Bennett is believed to have been epileptic and may 
have been mauled during a fit.

Neighbours heard screams from the terraced home and one dialled 999 after hearing shouts of 'no, no, no' coming from the home where Emma lived with her boyfriend.

Miss Bennett, who suffered injuries to her neck and head, apparently tried to sell Dollar on Facebook for £100 because of its aggressive nature.

A
 neighbour said that Miss Bennett had moved into the street around two years ago.

The family of Emma Bennett have released a tribute.

In a statement they said: 'We are all very deeply upset at Emma's death, not just because she has been taken from us so suddenly but because of the horrific circumstances and the fact she was on her own at the time she was injured.

'Emma was a mother of four and although she had had some issues in her life she loved her children. She was a lively person who had a great sense of fun but she was also strong-headed and had her own opinions.

'She was the eldest of four children and had two brothers and a sister. They were at her bedside in hospital along with her mother and grandparents when she passed away.

'We are all devastated at Emma's death but the whole family has pulled together and are really supporting each other. We are grateful to everyone who has sent messages of sympathy and support.

'We hope that by making this statement and releasing a photo of Emma that the media will respect our privacy at this difficult time.'

'I got a call when I was shopping that they had cordoned the whole street off,' she said.

'I
 heard rumours there was a vicious dog attack after someone had broken 
into a home but it turned out it was Emma who got attacked by her own 
dog.

'We'd heard that a 
few weeks back the pitbull started getting really nasty with her because
 she is epileptic.

'If she had a seizure and she was on her own he didn't
 like it.

'I think she 
has had a fit and the pitbull's got hold of her - that's the only thing I
 can think of.

'Apparently it wanted to go for her whenever she was 
having a fit.'

A
 West Yorkshire Police spokesman said last night: 'Two dogs were seized 
following the incident and police inquiries remain ongoing this evening.

'Officers would like to speak to anybody who has information about the incident and the dogs involved in it.'

Armed police said they were called to
 'a woman in distress with serious dog bite injuries'. It is believed 
the victim was home alone when she was mauled.

One of her dogs fled the 
property when police arrived but was contained by officers in an 
adjacent street, while another dog was safely removed from the property.

Both animals are still alive and being cared for by police.

Ms Bennett was taken to Leeds General Infirmary for treatment but police confirmed she died last night.

The force added: 'One dog which got loose from the property was contained by officers in Back Dawlish Road and recovered.

'Another was safely removed from the address a short time later.'

Neighbours said that the terraced street was sealed off while officers contained one of the dogs.

One resident, who did not wish to be named, said: 'They were definitely dangerous dogs.

'There must have been about 15 police officers and it was just crazy.

'The dog seemed to be loose for ages and there were two cars that blocked the street off.

'I was just shocked and saw her in the back of the ambulance and paramedics were pounding on her heart. She was just floppy. It's just madness.'
