Talented: Martin Finn, 23, is wowing audiences across the UK with his singing voice

An autistic man whose condition is so severe he has never spoken a full sentence is reducing audiences to tears with his impressive singing voice. 

Martin Finn, 23, from Atherton near Wigan, in Lancashire, has to be cared for around the clock by his parents John and Norma.

Despite not being able to string more than three words together, Martin is pitch-perfect and is now performing in concerts around the UK.

One of his favourite tunes to sing is Ronan Keating's When You Say Nothing At All. 

Martin's father John, 64, a retired builder, told Sheron Boyle of theSunday People: 'The gap between his disability and his ability makes him one in a million but that is how we have always seen him. 

'He can do nothing himself and will always be a toddler trapped in man's body.

'But music is his life and it has given him life.'

Mr Finn was diagnosed when he was three years old and went to a special needs school until the age of 14.

He then was transferred to Landgate School, in Wigan, which is for children with special needs.

It was there that his talent for singing was first spotted. 

According to his father, Martin listens to a lyric about five or six times before he can sing it back in tune. 

He has even begun reading books on music despite never being able to read at school.

Martin's parents have bought him more than 1,000 CDs, DVDs and videos and he has sung in front of audiences of up to 1,000 people.

Emotional: Martin took part in BBC3's Autistic Superstars which showcased his incredible voice

Before a concert, his mother Norma writes down the songs that he should sing and then reads him the list.

They can only give him a couple of minutes' notice before a performance because otherwise he becomes agitated. 

But a huge crowd did not put Martin off performing on BBC3's Autistic Superstars in 2010 where he sang Sweet Disposition by The Temper Trap.

His parents believe Martin is autistic savant - a person with a mental disabiity but has an exceptional skill. 

The movie Rain Man exposed millions of people to autism as well as the autistic savant phenomenon.

In the movie, Raymond, portrayed by Dustin Hoffman, displayed a great memory for baseball statistics, memorised parts of the telephone book, and counted cards in Las Vegas. 

Martin's parents are now hoping someone in the music industry can help him make a CD and DVD which could help to raise funds to care for the singer after they have gone.
