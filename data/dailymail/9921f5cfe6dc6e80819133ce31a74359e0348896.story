Hamas militants have released a video allegedly showing their fighters attacking an Israeli watchtower from a hidden tunnel before killing five guards stationed there.

The clip, which was broadcast on Hamas TV, shows militants running along a tunnel carrying machine guns and rocket launchers before emerging near an Israeli watchtower.

They catch an Israeli sentry by surprise before opening fire storming the watchtower compound to surround a fallen soldier.

Mohammed Deif, the shadowy leader of Hamas's armed wing, said in a voiceover that Palestinians would continue confronting Israel until its blockade on Gaza was lifted. 

'The occupying entity will not enjoy security unless our people live in freedom and dignity,' Deif said. 

'There will be no ceasefire before the (Israeli) aggression is stopped and the blockade is lifted. We will not accept interim solutions.'

Today has been the bloodiest day of Israel's three-week invasion of Gaza to date, with at least 100 Palestinians killed during heavy bombardment and shelling.

Local hospital officials put the total number of Palestinian dead in the conflict at 1,200, most of them civilians. On the Israeli side, 53 soldiers and three civilians have been killed.

The Israeli assault came after the deaths of 10 soldiers in Palestinian cross-border attacks on Monday, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning of a long conflict ahead.

The footage is likely to intensify the Israeli army's efforts in Gaza, as  their main objectives is to destroy tunnels which officials say are used by militants to carry out attacks.

The army has asked for a week more to complete the mission, and there has been strong Israeli public support for holding course.

UNRWA, the main U.N. relief agency in Gaza, said it was at 'breaking point' with more than 200,000 Palestinians having taken shelter in its schools and buildings following calls by Israel for civilians to evacuate whole neighbourhoods before military operations.

Today Israeli tanks destroyed Gaza's only power station. Even before the strike Gaza residents had electricity for only about three hours a day and today's hit is bound to reduce supplies even further.

The plant supplies up to two-thirds of Gaza's energy needs. Officials said the it could be out of action for a year.

Electricity was cut to the city of Gaza and many other parts of the Hamas-dominated territory after what officials said was Israeli shelling of the tanks containing about 3 million litres of diesel fuel.

'The power plant is finished,' said its director, Mohammed al-Sharif. An Israeli military spokeswoman had no immediate comment and said she was checking the report.

Gaza City municipality said damage to the station could halt many of the area's water pumps, and it urged residents to ration water consumption. 

South Gaza gets some power from neighbouring Egypt. Power lines from Israel have been damaged during the war.

Tuesday marked the deadliest day of the conflict so far as Israel stepped up its shelling operation, leaving at least 100 Palestinians dead

So far the conflict has killed 1,200 Palestinians, mostly civilians, while 53 Israeli solders have died and three of its civilians have been killed

Palestinians launched 54 rockets towards southern and central Israel, including the Tel Aviv and Jerusalem area, the military said, adding that five were shot down by Iron Dome interceptors while the rest fell wide, causing no damage.

The Israeli military said soldiers killed five gunmen who opened fire after emerging from a tunnel inside the Gaza Strip and that 110 targets were struck in the enclave on Tuesday. 

They included four weapons caches, which the military said were hidden in mosques, and a rocket launcher near another mosque. Residents said 20 houses were destroyed and two mosques hit.

Hospitals said tank shells and air strikes killed 12 people in north Gaza, including an UNRWA doctor and his brother.

UNRWA said it found a rocket cache in one of its central Gaza schools on Tuesday, the third such incident.

Today shelling by Israeli tanks destroyed the only power station in Gaza. Before the strike Palestinians only received three hours of power a day, which will now reduce further

Israel has balked at freeing up Gaza's borders under any de-escalation deal unless Hamas's disarmament is also guaranteed.

Egypt said it was revising an unconditional truce proposal that Israel had originally accepted but Hamas rejected.

'We are hearing that Israel has approved a ceasefire but Hamas has not,' an Egyptian official told Reuters, an account that the Netanyahu government neither confirmed nor denied.

The U.S.-backed administration of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, saying it was also speaking for Hamas and Islamic Jihad in the Gaza Strip, voiced support on Tuesday for a 24-72 hour ceasefire.

Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri disputed that statement but confirmed there were 'intensive, ongoing contacts' on a truce.
