Cambridge United are set for a massive £1.7m windfall after their heroic FA Cup draw with Manchester United on Friday - and it looks like they're planning to put the money to good use.

The League Two side, who defied the odds to stop Louis van Gaal's lavishly-assembled team, are planning to install new toilets at the Abbey Stadium with the cash.

The U's have already raked in £250,000 from the goalless draw and have further TV revenue and a split of the Old Trafford gate receipts to come from next Wednesday's replay.

And as club chairman Dave Doggett revealed, they're now flush with success: 'Hopefully we can get the stadium done and start putting in some proper toilets.

'Some toilets and tea bars and more hospitality... that's what we will do.'

The Abbey Stadium has been the club's home since 1932 and is crumbling in places, but the unexpected revenue will enable Cambridge to spruce up their ground.

It is particularly important for the club after plans for a new ground at nearby Trumpington were turned down by the local council back in 2013.

Instead, they will redevelop their traditional home with plans set to be unveiled soon.

Manager Richard Money said the money would certainly come in handy: 'Ahead of this, we were on a plan to build this club up slowly, bit-by-bit.

'After all, we have been out of the League 10 years. The replay means we can now sprint quicker than we thought. It is a huge step.

'We are still looking over our shoulder trying not to get into trouble. But who knows?

'The top seven in this league means you can get promoted and we have to try.'
