Female immigrants being held at a notorious detention centre are treated like animals and sexually abused by staff, a refugee charity has claimed.

Women at the Yarl's Wood detention centre in Bedfordshire are being watched by male staff in intimate situations including when using the toilet, Women for Refugee Women (WRW) said in a report.

They claim this is despite reassurances from the Home Office that this practice would not be allowed after they explained most of the women at Yarl's Wood are victims of sexual violence.

The charity interviewed 38 women who were recently or currently detained in Yarl's Wood, of whom 33 said that they were seen by male staff in the centre in situations including when naked and when using the toilet or bathroom.

Six women claimed staff had made sexual suggestions and three alleged they were touched sexually. Seven reported being physically assaulted.

One interviewee told the report: 'They spoke to me as if I was an animal, not a human being.'

Another, who was on suicide watch in Yarl's Wood, told the charity: 'When you are on suicide watch you ask for a woman when you want to take a shower, they said we don't have enough staff.

'I was on suicide watch and so was my room mate. A man and a woman were watching us. We asked if the man could leave while we went to the toilet and he refused. They didn't respect us.'

Other findings show 13 - or a third - of the women interviewed said that they were searched by male staff, and 22, more than half, said they were searched by women while being watched by men.

Yarl's Wood has faced heavy criticism in the past by human rights campaigners amid reports of sexual misconduct by staff, women being detained for long periods and pregnant detainees being held without justification.

Despite troubles faced by the centre, the Home Office recently awarded private firm Serco a £70 million contract to operate the immigration jail for a further eight years.

Conservative MP Richard Fuller, who is a member of the current Parliamentary Detention Inquiry panel, said: 'I support a robust immigration policy but no purpose is served by locking up vulnerable women indefinitely in Yarl's Wood.

'Current detention practice is inefficient, unjust and expensive and reform is urgently needed.'

The WRW report is being launched at a conference in central London with more than 100 refugee women and supporters

The report also described how more than 70% of the women in the sample said that they had been raped or been victims of other sexual violence before coming to the UK.

And more than half of the women were on suicide watch, while 40% said that they self-harmed while inside.

Natasha Walter, director of Women for Refugee Women, said: 'This report shows that survivors of sexual violence who come to the UK seeking protection are routinely being locked up and are denied privacy and dignity in detention despite claims to the contrary from the Home Office.

'The behaviour of staff, particularly male staff, in Yarl's Wood detention centre, is adding to the trauma of survivors of sexual violence.

'While Britain is taking steps to try to combat sexual violence at home and abroad and protect victims, the Government cannot allow this to continue.

'Detention has no place in the asylum process. It is expensive, unjust and inefficient to lock up people who have come here to seek asylum.

'Only a minority of women leave Yarl's Wood to be deported; most re-enter British society to continue their asylum claims. Women who seek protection in the UK should be able to live in the community while their claims are considered.'

However, a Home Office spokesman said: 'Detention and removal are essential elements of an effective immigration system. 

'We are committed to treating all detainees with dignity and respect, and take any allegations to the contrary very seriously.

'As the report itself makes clear, the allegations in this report are uncorroborated — so we have invited Women for Refugee Women to supply details of the cases in question so that they can be investigated fully.

'The latest independent inspection by Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons found that Yarl's was a respectful and safe place.' 

While Norman Abusin from contractor Serco added: 'We take all complaints seriously and we have strict procedures for dealing with them. They are always fully investigated and, if appropriate, disciplinary action is taken.'
