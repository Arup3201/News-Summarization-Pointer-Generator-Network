Armstrong Desvallons, of Terrytown, learned his fate Tuesday after admitting that he practiced WWE-style moves on 5-year-old Viloude Louis while babysitting her in June.

The toddler died from internal bleeding and lacerations to her liver after being body-slammed and elbowed in the chest about 20 times by her older half-brother, according to prosecutors.

Justice: Viloude Louis' stepbrother Armstrong Desvallons was sentenced to three years in a juvenile center for the June death of the 5-year-old girl

Desvallons pleaded guilty to negligent homicide in November. He is expected to get psychological treatment and education programming while staying at the secure facility.

He could be released earlier than three years depending on his progress.

During his sentencing at Jefferson Parish Juvenile Court, members of the Marrero Seventh-Day Adventist Church where the Desvallons family worshiped described the 13-year-old as a good kid and asked the judge to release him into their probationary custody.

However, Armstrong's own stepfather, Vilger Louis, insisted that he was disrespectful and would repeat the actions that resulted in his sister’s death given the chance. 

'I don’t think you are going to give Armstrong license to go out there and kill somebody again,' Mr Louis, who was Viloude's biological father, told the judge, according to The Advocate.

Allourdes Desvallons, the boy's mother, told Judge Andrea Janzen that little Viloude was 'very special' to her.

'What he [Armstrong] did, it's like he ended my life,' Mrs Desvallons told Janzen. 'What the judge would decide, I would comply.'

WWE also weighed in on the judge’s decision, according to NOLA.com, saying in a statement that the wrestling organization supports the ruling that Armstrong ‘absolutely knew that he was hurting his 5-year-old little sister.'

'Therefore, it is illogical to conclude that the brutal and ultimately fatal beating of a 5-year-old little girl by a teenager could be confused with imitation of WWE moves seen on TV.' The statement read.

Viloude Louis died from the brutal beating June 16 in Terrytown. Armstrong had originally been charged 
with manslaughter, but took a plea deal at the trial in Jefferson Parish
Juvenile Court last month return for the less serious charge.

The
plea deal came after Judge Janzen deemed his interview with detectives after the 
death as inadmissible because neither he nor his mother, who attended, 
would have understood the legal obligations of what was happening.

He
wrote a statement in court confessing that he played with Viloude ‘in a bad way’ 
and hit her on the back and stomach 15 to 20 times.

He also admitted using ‘body slams’ that he’d seen pro-wrestlers John Cena and Mark Henry perform.

The little girl had suffered broken ribs, internal bleeding and a lacerated liver.

The
teenager told officers 
after his arrest that their mother was out of the house when the incident took place.

Paramedics found the girl unresponsive and she was pronounced dead a short time later.

Armstrong was arrested after a coroner investigation found the girl died of multiple injuries two days after the death.

Her brother had initially told investigators the girl had a stomach ache and went upstairs to 
brush her teeth, and 30 minutes later he found her on the floor 
complaining her stomach still hurt, Jefferson Parish Sheriff's spokesman
Col. John Fortunato said.

The
teenager claimed he took the girl downstairs to the sofa and called 911
when he saw she was no longer breathing. Dispatchers told him to start 
CPR and paramedics arrived on the scene.

The
coroner's office said there did not appear to be any outward signs of 
injury and her death was left as unclassified, but then Desvallons told 
detectives he had been practicing World Wrestling Entertainment-style 
moves on the girl, The Times-Picayune reported earlier this year.

Hearing: The trial took place at Jefferson Juvenile Court

He
said that even when his little half-sister said she was in pain, he 
continued to carry out the moves on her. Detectives added that he 
appeared to be enjoying talking about the assault.

The Sheriff's Office reclassified her death as a homicide and Desvallons was arrested on suspicion of second-degree murder.
