These heart-warming photographs show the unbreakable bond between a sister and her little brother.

Lexie Till underwent a painful transplant operation to donate life-changing bone marrow to her three-year-old brother.

Cuddling up to Drew, the 10-year-old cradles him in a protective embrace before selflessly going into the operating theatre to help her brother enjoy a 'nice life'.

The three-year-old was diagnosed with Diamond Blackfan Anaemia, which causes his body to produce few or no red blood cells.

Devoted big sister Lexie Till 10, donated her bone marrow to her three-year-old brother Drew who needed a transplant to help cure a rare blood condition

Drew (pictured left) was diagnosed with Diamond Blackfan Anaemia, which causes his body to produce few or no red blood cells and Lexie (pictured right) was found to be a suitable bone marrow donor

Lexie, pictured with her brother during the bone marrow transfusion, said: 'Drew means everything to me, he's really special, and I just wanted to help him so he can have a nice life'

He was just four-months-old when he was doctors revealed he had the illness, which affects just 700 people worldwide.

Lexie said: ‘Drew means everything to me, he’s really special, and I just wanted to help him so he can have a nice life.’

Her
 brother had been enduring monthly blood transfusions since he was five 
weeks old, as well treatment to remove excess iron from his heart and 
liver every day.

When doctors told his mother Helen, 43 that her son would need a bone marrow transplant if he was going to live a healthy life, the search for a donor began.

Diamond Blackfan Anaemia (DBA) is a rare blood condition where the bone marrow fails to produce red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body.

Only around 700 people are thought to have it in the world.

DBA can cause can cause fatigue, poor growth, lack of appetite and a pale complexion.

Patients are treated with monthly blood transfusions to bring their red blood cell count up to normal levels.

The body normally recycles iron from old red blood cells when producing new ones but this does not happen in DBA patients, where iron accumulates from the transfusions.

Iron overload can cause damage to the major organs, so patients must take a 'chelation' drug to remove excess iron from their bodies. This often requires a nightly infusion of medication via a subcutaneous needle over a ten hour period.

Many doctors think a bone marrow transplant is the best long-term option, but finding a suitable donor can be challenging.

Lexie was found to be a match and told her parents she wanted to go through with the operation to save her brother’s life.

Mrs Till, from Whitby, Elsmere Port, said: ‘We were told that Drew needed a transplant in October last year but my husband and I had already been tested and we weren’t a match.

‘Lexie was tested and she fortunately was a match and she said she wanted to go through with the operation.

‘I was 
really anxious about her having to go through the process - putting a 
healthy child through anaesthetic and an operation just felt very 
strange.

‘But I was a lot happier once she was back on the ward eating and drinking and feeling better.

‘She just couldn’t wait to get up and go send see Drew.’

Doctors became concerned when Drew stopped responding to his treatment.

The team caring for the three-year-old told his parents Helen and Andy, that a bone marrow transplant was thought to be the only way forward.

And so last month the
 siblings were admitted to Bone Marrow Transplant Unit at Royal 
Manchester Children’s Hospital.

On June 27 both children were taken into theatre for their operations.

Their mother Helen Till, said: 'Drew received the bone marrow the same day and all went well. It was administered via a transfusion and Lexie was there to keep him company as it happened. It is an amazing process'

The family (Lexie, Drew and their father Andy pictured left before the operation) were told that Drew would need a bone marrow transplant if he was going to live a healthy life. Lexie (pictured right with Drew) told her parents she wanted to go through with the painful operation to help her little brother enjoy 'a nice life'

The siblings were admitted to Bone Marrow Transplant Unit at Royal Manchester Children's Hospital for their operations on June 27. Their mother Helen said they are both home and are recovering well

Mother Mrs Till said her children are now both home and are recovering well.

She said: ‘She recovered really well, went home the same day and was back in school a few days later.

‘Drew received the bone marrow the same day and all went well.

'It was administered via a transfusion and Lexie was there to keep him company as it happened. It is an amazing process.’

Drew has begun his 12-month road to recovery.

‘We are so proud of Lexie for stepping in to help her little brother and it will be a blessing for the family to get some normality,’ Mrs Till said.
