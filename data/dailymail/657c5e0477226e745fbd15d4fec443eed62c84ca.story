As soon as animal welfare workers placed disabled kitten Thumper in his custom-made walker, they knew he was ready to make some giant leaps.

Footage shows the long-limbed kitten take a few tentative steps forward, and then, seeming to realize he's walking all by himself, Thumper takes off.

Thumper was found with his brothers and sisters abandoned in a yard with two other litters of kittens by People and Cats Together (PACT).

First steps: As soon as Thumper was put in his walker, he knew what to do

Nine kittens were saved that day, including a little white one with black markings they named Thumper.

But from the beginning, PACT staff noticed something different about Thumper.Â 

'He was very lanky,' says PACT member Jane.

'Almost built like a newborn deer. He had no ability to walk. He was dragging himself.'

Vets diagnosed the kitten with a rare neurological disorder for which there is no cure.

A lot of heart: Thumper's carers all teared up watching him take his first steps

Rare disorder: Thumper didn't seem to have any control over his back legs, dragging himself around by his front paws

PACT staff despaired of his chances.

'His neurological challenges... it's just so hard,' says Jane, breaking down.

'They don't survive environments like that.'

As the other kittens were progressing, Thumper was falling behind developmentally. He couldn't play with them and vets didn't know if he'd ever be able to walk.

PACT came up with an idea: why not get a little walker for Thumper to make walking a bit easier for him?

The walker, which holds Thumper upright in a sling, enabled the cat to exercise his legs without losing his balance and falling over.

Striding ahead: Within weeks, Thumper was walking around confidently

'We got him in his walker, and from the minute we put him in, he took off,' says Jane.

Within weeks, Thumper was racing all over the place in his new walker - and strengthening his legs and back as he went.

When Thumper decided he was strong enough to go it alone, he made it clear to his carers he wanted the walker gone.

Made for walking: Thumper now seems to have endless energy and play, runs and chases all day long

And when he stood up and walked by himself for the first time, there wasn't a dry eye in the house.

Now, Thumper has almost caught up with the other kittens. He still has a distinctive walk, but Jane thinks that's part of his charm.

'He's just a great little guy,' says Jane.

'There's something in these little ones that we can't quite grasp.'

Thumper is up for adoption and looking for a home.

'He's got so much heart and he need someone who will love him as much as we love him,' says Jane.
