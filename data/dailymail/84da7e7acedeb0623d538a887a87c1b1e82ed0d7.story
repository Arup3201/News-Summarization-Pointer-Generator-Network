A teenage girl and her 27-year-old boyfriend are accused of murdering her 14-month-old brother on New Year's Day.

Tereza Lackova, 19, and her boyfriend Marek Holub, both of Balsall Heath, Birmingham, are jointly charged with murdering Lackova's baby brother Santino Balaz.

The unemployed pair are also charged with causing, or allowing, the death of a child.

An ambulance was sent to an address in the Balsall Heath area after a 999 call was made to West Midlands Ambulance Service at 3.45pm on New Year's Day.

Young Santino - a Czech national - died at Birmingham Children's Hospital after suffering extensive injuries and fractures to several parts of his body, West Midlands Police said.

The pair appeared at Birmingham Magistrates' Court with a translator yesterday for a short hearing.

Wearing blue T-shirts, they spoke only to confirm their names, ages and addresses.

The pair were remanded in custody to appear at Birmingham Crown Court tomorrow.

District Judge Rebecca Crane told them: 'This matter will now go to Birmingham Crown Court.

'You will appear on January 8. You are remanded in custody until that date.'

Officers from West Midlands Police are now liaising with officials in the Czech Republic to trace Santino's mother.

She is believed to have returned to her home country in September last year.

Detective Inspector Justin Spanner said: We are awaiting further tests following a post-mortem.

'Santino was found to have extensive injuries and fractures to several areas of his body.'
