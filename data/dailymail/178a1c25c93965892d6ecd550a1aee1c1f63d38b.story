Madhur Jaffrey has dismissed Balti curry as 'a craze' with 'no authentic origin' and predicted 'it will slowly die' in this country

It is one of Britain's most popular curries. But the popularity of the Balti may soon be over, according to one of the nation's top food writers.

Madhur Jaffrey has dismissed the dish as 'a craze' with 'no authentic origin' and predicted 'it will slowly die' in this country.

Jaffrey, who was born in Delhi and became a household name with her BBC cookery shows in the 1980s, said Indian food in Britain was slowly getting better.

And she said the Balti, which had 'origins in no place we would want to visit', would slowly die out as people moved on to other Indian dishes.

The dish, which is thought to have been invented in a Birmingham curry house in 1977, gained popularity in the UK throughout the 1980s and 1990s.

It recently appeared in a list of the top ten most popular curries by the British Curry Club.

Speaking yesterday at the Cheltenham Literature Festival, Jaffrey said it was an easy way to cook but was not the traditional Indian way.

She said: 'I studied the Balti phenomenon quite a few years ago. Around the 80s, I really studied the Balti and whether it had any authenticity or not. I think it was just a craze.

'It was just a version of cooking in a wok and it was stir fried food.

'The heat is so high that sauces get reduced very fast. It's a style of cooking where you have pre-cooked or partially cooked meat sitting there, pressure cooked, and you make different sauces for that meat. That became known as Balti cooking.

'I don't think it has origins in any place we would want to visit.'

Jaffrey, who was speaking at the Cheltenham Literature Festival, said British Indian curries used to taste like 'mud' but that technique was slowly improving.

She added of the Balti: 'I don't think it has origins in any place we would want to visit. I think it just grew up in Birmingham, then Leeds, then a lot of places around there.

'I think it will slowly die. People like it, they obviously get a kick out of it. But I don't think it has authentic origins.'

Jaffrey, 81, who was awarded CBE in 2004, first came to the UK to study at The Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, from which she graduated in 1957.

She appeared on a number of cookery programmes including Madhur Jaffrey's Indian Cookery in 1982, Madhur Jaffrey's Far Eastern Cookery in 1989 and Madhur Jaffrey's Flavours of India in 1995.

Yesterday, she said she had decided to leave India because of the 'inequality' women faced in the home.

And she hit out at sexism in the restaurateur business, saying women had been held back from being chefs because of societal constraints.

She said: 'My grandmother and mother ran kitchens for 30 people, 40 people. And they were large households that they ran and they ran them with great efficiency and great care and cleanliness and all the rest of it.

'They didn't need to be told by a man that only men can do the job. Men step in and take away the job when there's money to be made.

'And when you look at the history of chefs, it's men – because for example in a country like India women weren't allowed to go out and mix with the men. There's all kinds of other reasons that kept them back – not their abilities.

'Any woman can run a kitchen, she's used to it for thousands of years. But it's where the men allow women, it's the women's place in society, I think all that has been the problem.'

She also advocated teaching more multicultural dishes in schools, to enable children to learn about other cultures.

She said: 'They're not only learning each other's cultures but they learn how to cook each other's food.

'That is a wonderful way that schools can teach people about other cultures, and bring food in as a method of learning, which I think in schools is absolutely wonderful.'
