An Australian actress has shared video of the panicked moment she fled from an AirAsia Zest flight that overshot the runway in the Philippines.

Natalia Moon, 23, from Brisbane, recorded her dash for safety on her mobile phone as she escaped the Airbus A320-216, which landed at Kalibo Airport in Aklan province. 

'Oh my god, oh my god,' the breathless actress said, shortly after darting down the jet's emergency slide. 'Holy crap. We just, we didn't even land on the runway.'

'Is anybody else tripping out?' she asked her fellow passengers. The plane was flying from Manila, the country's capital.

'Engine was shut immediately, we were told to leave bags, deplane asap. Firetruck was waiting,' she said. 

Describing the terrifying incident, Ms Damazo-Santos said: 'Nobody seems to be hurt. Weather was bad because of #senangph [sic]. Plane came to a very abrupt stop.'

'Feeling a little lost . Air hostess staff did a great job getting everyone off the plane.'
