John McCain has compared Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to a monkey on Twitter as he mocked Ahmadinejad's declaration that he would be willing to be the first Iranian sent into space.

Earlier today Iran's President said wants to be the first person to be launched into space by his country's fledgling space programme.

McCain tweeted: 'So Ahmadinejad wants to be first Iranian in space – wasn’t he just there last week?'

He was referring to Iran's claim that it successfully launched a monkey into space and
back, hailing the mission as major triumph in their goal of sending
humans into space.

The Senator also linked to a Yahoo! News report about the monkey in his controversial tweet.

Twitter users were divided, with some claiming the tweet had a racist element because of the use of the word 'monkey' in relation to a dark-skinned man.

Rachel Moss said: 'That is absolutely disgusting. Criticism of Ahmadinejad fine. Racist slurs are not.'

But McCain was not without his defenders, such as Adil Ray, who said: 'So @SenJohnMcCain makes a joke comparing Ahmedinijad to a Monkey and some say its racist? I'd say its more offensive to monkeys.'

Faced with criticism, McCain later tweeted: 'lighten up folks, can't everyone take a joke'.

But Representative Justin Amash of Michigan, a fellow Republican, tweeted: 'Maybe you should wisen up & not make racist jokes.'

The veteran US senator has been criticised for other recent statements that were judged to be in poor taste.

In January he joked at a news conference about the prospect of a Senate colleague being held hostage in Afghanistan, just days after a hostage crisis Algeria killed three Americans and dozens of others.

Minutes later he quipped he was looking forward to interrogating Senator John Kerry using waterboarding, a method of torture allegedly adopted by CIA interrogators.

Ahmadinehad, himself no stranger to controversial statements, told a group of journalists at an exhibition of space achievements in Tehran that he is willing to risk his own life to be Iran's first astronaut in space.

'I'm ready to be the first Iranian to sacrifice myself for our country's scientists,' he said.

'Sending living things into space is the result of Iranian efforts and the dedication of thousands of Iranian scientists.'

Renowned for making provocative public statements, it was unclear whether President Ahmadinejad was serious.

The President's popularity has waned since he fell out with parliament and his second and final term finishes in June.

However
there was no independent verification of the feat and question marks 
were raised after footage appeared to show the heroic returning monkey 
looking remarkably different from when it made lift off.

The monkey, named 'Pishgam' which 
means pioneer in Farsi, was pictured being strapped into a space rocket and had lighter fur and a distinctive red mole above its eye.

But the triumphant animal dressed in a tuxedo at a post-flight press conference had much darker fur and no mole.

Nonetheless
the launch added to Western concerns about Iran's space programme 
because the same rocket technology could potentially be used to deliver a
nuclear warhead on a ballistic missile.

Anousheh Ansari was the first Iranian to make a journey into space 
aboard a Soyuz TMA-9 capsule from Baikonur, Kazakhastan, in September 
2006.

The 40-year-old telecommunications entrepreneur paid a reported 20
million dollars for a space station visit. Her journey became an 
inspiration to women in male-dominated Iran.

In 2010, Iran said it launched an Explorer rocket into space carrying a mouse, a turtle and worms.

Iran's space officials say they will launch a bigger rocket carrying a 
larger animal to obtain greater safety assurances before sending a man 
into space.

Defence Minister Ahmad Vahidi said Iran will soon send a satellite into 
space from its Imam Khomeini space centre, which is still under 
construction.

Iran already has a major satellite launch complex near Semnan, east of 
Tehran, and a satellite monitoring facility outside Mahdasht, 
west of the Iranian capital.

Leaders say they want to put Iranian satellites into orbit to monitor 
natural disasters in the earthquake-prone nation, improve 
telecommunications and expand military surveillance in the region.

President Ahmadinenjad's second and final term as president ends in June, and his political star has been on the wane since he fell out with parliament early in his second term and appeared to lose the support of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

On Sunday he stood up in parliament to play a tape recording that he said provided evidence of corruption by the family of parliamentary speaker Ali Larijani, his political arch-rival and a likely frontrunner to succeed him as president. Larijani and his brother Fazel denied the accusations.
