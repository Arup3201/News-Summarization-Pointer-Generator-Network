They call him the Coupon Kid - 6ft 4ins of lean, keen, bargain-hunting brilliance with an infallible eye for the best money-off deals.

And today he's back with a vengeance.

In an extraordinarily canny supermarket sweep, 16-year-old Jordon Cox has just used discount vouchers to buy food worth more than £572 - for fourpence.

Haul: Jordon redeemed 470 coupons to fill three Tesco trollies with special-offer goods

Kindhearted: Jordon gave away all his food to a charity that helps the homeless and disadvantaged families

That was all he had to pay after redeeming 470 coupons to fill three Tesco trollies with special-offer goods.

Then he gave it all away for Christmas to a charity that helps the homeless and disadvantaged families.

Now he is continuing to scour websites and magazines for more bargains in pursuit of a new personal record - to buy the maximum possible for a zero pence bill.

Jordon - featured in the Daily Mail eight months ago for his incredible voucher-vulture prowess - spent hours each day for coupon discounts to buy festive food such as puddings, sauces, stuffing... not forgetting the sprouts.

The total bill from Tesco's Brent Cross store in north London was £572.16 - reduced to 4p when discount and cash-back offers were applied during an hour-long session at the checkout.

The print-out was almost as tall as he is.

Jordon, of Brentwood, Essex, is studying for a B-tec qualification in business and enterprise: 'I read an article that said a thousandth of the UK population are unable to eat this Christmas because they don't have any money.

'I decided I wanted to help as many people as I can, and show that it's possible to shop very cheaply, if you know how.'

Jordon's total bill should have come to £572.16
