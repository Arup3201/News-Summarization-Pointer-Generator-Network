Two Cabinet ministers are at war over plans to slash green subsidies blamed for skyrocketing household bills.

Chancellor George Osborne wants to use his autumn budget statement to raid the power giant’s energy tariffs.

But he is facing a battle with Liberal Democrat Energy Secretary Ed Davey, who does not believe there is any justification in tearing up previously agreed targets.

The Chancellor has been angered by Labour leader Ed Miliband’s plan to freeze energy bills if elected.

Mr Osborne blames Mr Miliband’s ‘green’ policies as Labour’s Energy Secretary for helping force up bills.

Figures released yesterday show that families face paying an extra £425 over the next five years to pay for subsidies to meet green energy targets.

The total subsidy - levied on householders and businesses - will be nearly £22 billion by 2020, according to figures produced by the Taxpayers’ Alliance.

The money will go towards paying for controversial onshore and offshore windfarms, biomass plants, landfill gas siets and hydro power plants.

The Chancellor won applause at Tory conference when he pledged that Britain would not be at the forefront of tackling climate change.

But Mr Davey believes there is no justification for back-sliding on carbon reduction targets.

Almost £2 billion was spent subsidising renewable energy in the last financial year. But this will rise to £5.3 billion a year by 2018-19.

Wind farms will account for the majority of the rise.

Matthew Sinclair, Taxpayers Alliance chief executive, said subsidies for renewable generation should instead be used to support research aimed at bringing down the cost of green power.

He said: 'Targets that require massive investment in the energy sector, to install expensive technologies like offshore wind turbines on an enormous scale, will always mean profits for energy companies and much higher prices for consumers.

‘If the Government are serious about easing the pressure on people’s living standards, they need to take action and scrap lavish renewable energy subsidies.

‘And it is a joke for Ed Miliband to pretend he is taking on the Big Six on behalf of consumers when he is proposing to keep the targets in place.

'If politicians are serious about helping families with struggling bills, then they need to do something about dysfunctional and painfully expensive energy policies.’

Dr Lee Moroney of the Renewable Energy Foundation, said: ‘Government subsidies which are added to electricity bills in order to meet over ambitious EU climate change targets are complex, opaque, and very expensive for the consumer.

‘The subsidy costs are set to increase significantly and will last 15 to 25 years.

'The scale of the consumer costs is shocking and senseless in view of the fact that UK greenhouse gas emissions could be reduced faster and more economically by less extravagant measures.’

Domestic energy prices are set to rise yet again this winter with the ‘Big Six’ power firms blaming the increase on government and environmental levies.

A spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said: ‘The Government is transparent about the impact of energy and climate policies on bills.

‘It’s the global gas price, not green subsidies, that has primarily been pushing up energy bills. 60 per cent of the increase in household energy bills between 2010 and 2012 was caused by this.

'Investing in home grown alternatives is the only sure fire way of insulating our economy and bill payers from this volatility.

‘In any case, our household energy efficiency policies are on average more than offsetting the costs of clean energy investment.

'By 2020 the average household bill will be £166 lower than it would be if we were doing nothing.’
