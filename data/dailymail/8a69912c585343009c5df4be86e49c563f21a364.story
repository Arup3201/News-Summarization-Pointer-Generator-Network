A relative of a First World War hero was hit with a parking fine after she stopped her car to observe an Armistice Day silence.

Anna Whitworth - whose great uncle Captain Reginald Salomons died saving his men during the 1915 Gallipoli campaign - pulled over safely at 11am on Tuesday to take part in the two minute silence being respected around the country.

But the long-held tradition was less of a priority for a local parking warden, who quickly appeared on the scene and handed Ms Whitworth a fine.

A motorist stopped her car near Kensington High Street on Tuesday to observe a two minutes' silence, but was left shocked when she was handed a parking ticket by a passing council warden

Ms Whitworth, 69, was driving along Kensington High Street, west London when she heard on the radio that it would soon be 11am.

After finding a place to stop - which was on double yellow lines - she got out of her car to remember her great uncle and those like him to lost their lives in war.

But her silence was interrupted by a parking warden, whose behaviour she has branded 'daft and unreasonable'.

She told The Times: 'I told him I was only observing the silence for Armistice Day for those fallen in war, but he just looked completely blank.

'I told him he should have some respect, but he didn't respond and said instead that he was going to give me a ticket.'

Trafalgar Square comes to a halt on Tuesday. The council involved in the parking row has said it will consider refunding the parking ticket, but the motorist says she does not want to take the matter further 

Kensington Borough Council officials have urged Ms Whitworth to get in touch, suggesting they may rescind the fine on appeal.

But, speaking to MailOnline this morning, Ms Whitworth said she would not be taking the matter further.

She said: 'Armistice Day is about peace and reconciliation and, in the spirit of that, I will not be making any further complaint.'

Ms Whitworth's great uncle, who was from Kent, was on the HMS Hythe in 1915 when it sank in Turkey while on operations. He and 127 others died.

Documents recently uncovered by historians show he helped other men off the ship first and gave his life-jacket to a comrade who could not swim.

Captain Salomons died just days after his 30th birthday in October 1915

The third David Salomons - known as Reggie or Reginald - was educated at Eton and Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge before training as a lawyer.

He later became involved with the territorial army and the training of local cadets in Kent.

In 1912, he was appointed to command his father's cadet detachment in Southborough, Kent and at the outbreak of the First World War he moved to the Kent Fortress Royal Engineers.

The field company sailed to the Mediterranean on October 11 1915 – one of the last groups to be sent before a War Cabinet decision to stop sending any more troops to Gallipoli came into force.

On the October 28 that year, his ship ran into another British troop ship, the Sarnia, which was returning to Mudros Bay having left her passengers at Helles, in what is now Turkey.

His heroism was uncovered by a historian two years ago when a letter to Capt Salomon's father, Col Sir David Lionel Salomons, a wealthy baronet from Tunbridge Wells, was found.

The letter, from eyewitness Maj Alfred Ruston, stated: 'At the beginning, the two vessels clung to each other for a few minutes and about 50 men and several officers scrambled across on to the other vessel.

'But though Captain Salomons was warned to get over also himself, he would not do so and I am sure that it was because he would see his beloved men off first.'
