Claims: Vicky Pryce (pictured outside court today) was presented with a 'fait accompli' by her husband Chris Huhne who said she must accept his speeding points, her brother told her trial

Vicky Pryce faced a ‘fait accompli’ when her husband Chris Huhne forced her to take his speeding points, her brother said yesterday.

George Courmouzis said his sister told him she did ‘something against her will’ shortly after she helped the Lib Dem Cabinet Minister dodge a driving ban.

The businessman, who owns a high-profile sports marketing company in Athens, said he knew the speeding incident was a ‘point of contention’ after it took place in 2003.

He flew in from Greece to give evidence on Pryce’s behalf in the closing stages of her retrial for perverting the course of justice.

Prosecutors asked why he did not give evidence at her first trial but had now appeared ‘like a rabbit out of a hat’.

Mr Courmouzis, who owns homes in Notting Hill, Athens and South Carolina, said the matter was mentioned up to five times in 2003.

‘She described it to me as having done something against her will,’ he said. ‘I remember irritation in the spring of 2003 over the fact that Vicky was forced by Chris to take speeding points because he had reached his limit.

'It was mostly irritation about the manner in which she was presented with no option. She had been nominated by him and presented with a fait accompli.’

Mr Courmouzis said his younger sister’s anger grew when Huhne lost his licence anyway over another offence.

Under cross-examination by prosecutor Andrew Edis QC, Mr Courmouzis admitted he was called to give evidence only ‘four or five days ago’.

And he faced questions about why his comments fitted so neatly into Pryce’s defence of marital coercion – meaning Huhne forced her to commit the crime.

Mr Edis added: ‘Have you just come forward out of family loyalty to support her?’

Later, as he summed up the  
prosecution case, Mr Edis told the jury to question why the defendant’s 
brother ‘appears for the first time like a rabbit out of the hat’. He 
said 21st century sexual equality meant Pryce was accountable for what 
she did.

Allegations: Pryce's brother George Courmouzis (left) claimed she was irritated and upset that Huhne (right) had nominated her as the driver and reacted as someone who had 'done something beyond her will'

He said in modern times a ‘true case’ of marital coercion would be ‘very, very rare’.

Mr Edis said she exposed her actions out of a thirst for revenge when Huhne left her for bisexual Carina Trimingham.

He added: ‘This is a determined, rather dishonest, very sophisticated and manipulative campaign to destroy somebody.’

In Pryce’s defence, Julian Knowles QC 
said, despite her success in business she was not ‘superwoman’ and was 
vulnerable to marriage pressures.

He said the former Government 
economics adviser was not proud of her actions when she exposed Huhne’s 
wrongdoing in the  bitter aftermath of their collapsed marriage.

But he said she was a different woman 
eight years earlier who was forced into a ‘second’s lapse’ by her 
bullying and ambitious husband.

Pryce, 60, of Clapham, South-West 
London, denies perverting the course of justice. The jury is expected to
begin considering its verdict today.
