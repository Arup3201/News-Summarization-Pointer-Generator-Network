This is the moment a team of binmen accidentally dumped a huge heap of rubbish in the middle of a busy high street during rush hour.

Refuse workers were collecting wheelie bins from businesses on Shirley Road in Southampton at around 8am yesterday morning when their truck malfunctioned and emptied its entire contents in the middle of the road.

The team were left shovelling the rubbish with a mechanical street sweeper for over an hour causing traffic chaos for those trying to make their way to work.

Southampton City Council has now launched an investigation into the incident and is reviewing its entire fleet of similar vehicles.

Steve Locke, who runs a recruitment agency on the street, said: ‘It was quite funny to be fair.

‘I don’t think it was anybody’s fault.

‘The workers ran to hit the stop button but it never stopped unloading. There was nothing anyone could do.’

Benedict Carey, who captured the moment on his mobile phone as he stood nearby, said: ‘It certainly was a bizarre sight.

‘I did say to the operators “okay, who pressed the wrong button?”

‘They claimed it wasn’t possible to do that, and that we should blame “city council cutbacks”.

‘They seemed in pretty good humour about the whole thing.’

The arrival of a JCB eventually sped up the clean-up process, successfully clearing the road.

A Southampton City Council statement said: ‘The waste accidentally dropped has now been cleared, with staff reacting immediately to minimise any disruption to residents.

‘We will be looking into the cause of the failure to the defective vehicle immediately.

‘Once the cause is known we will be checking other vehicles to ensure that this remains an isolated incident.’
