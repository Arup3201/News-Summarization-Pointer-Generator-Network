A Russian-made passenger plane crashed into a steep cliff on a long-dormant Indonesian volcano during a demonstration flight to potential buyers and journalists.

Its wreckage was spotted by helicopters today, but there was no sign of survivors among the 47 people on board. Search and rescue teams are now on their way to the crash site.

Family members, many of whom spent a long, sleepless night at the airport, broke down in tears on hearing the news today. Others stared blankly ahead in disbelief.

this one pictured, has crashed along a cliff in Indonesia, but the conditions of the 48 people on board is still unknown

'From the pictures we're seeing, it looks like it was a total loss,' said Daryatmo, chief of the national search and rescue agency, who, like many Indonesians, goes by one name, as the first images flashed across local TV.

The Sukhoi Superjet-100, Russia's first new passenger jet since the fall of the Soviet Union two decades ago, was scattered on a steep near the top of Mount Salak, a volcano just 30 miles south west of the capital Jakarta.

The company's blue-and-white logo peeked through the dense canopy of trees.

The location will hamper efforts to evacuate victims, said Gagah Prakoso, a spokesman for the Search and Rescue National Agency, adding they would have to be pulled to a hovering helicopter by ropes and nets.

The plane left Halim Perdanakusuma Airport in Jakarta for a quick test flight aimed at impressing potential buyers.

Twenty-one minutes after take-off, the crew asked for permission to descend from 10,000ft to 6,000ft, said Daryatmo.

The plane went off the radar immediately afterwards. It was not clear why the Russian pilot and co-pilot asked to drop down, especially when it was so close to the 7,000ft mountain, or if the descent was approved.

Tapes between the pilots and air traffic control were being reviewed, said Tatang Kurniadi, chief of the National Commission on Safety Transportation.

More than 1,000 people, including soldiers and police, took part in the search and rescue efforts early today. Eventually,helicopters carrying out aerial surveys spotted the wreckage.

'They have clear view,' said Mr Prakoso. 'There is no sign of any of the passengers .... We're trying to move in closer to the wreckage now but its reachable only by foot.'

Russia's aerospace industry was badly undermined in the economic turmoil following the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.

The Superjet - developed by the civil aircraft division of Sukhoi with the co-operation with Western partners - has been widely considered the country's chance to regain a foothold in the international passenger plane market.

Its Welcome Asia! tour, which also included stops in Pakistan, Burma and Kazakhstan, was intended to drum up support.

Sunaryo from PT Trimarga Rekatama, the company that helped organise yesterday's event, said 47 people were on board, many of them potential buyers and journalists.

Among them were eight Russians, all from Sukhoi companies and 37 Indonesians.

Mystery: The jet, like the one pictured here, had begun its descent towards Jakarta airport after its demonstration flight when it disappeared

An American consultant with Indonesia's PT Sriwijaya Airline and a Frenchman with aircraft engine-maker Snecma were also on board.

The Superjet, a 75 to 95-seat plane, was being touted as a challenger to similar-sized jets from Canada's Bombardier. and Brazil's Embraer. It made its inaugural commercial flight last year.

'It is their big hope that they will somehow get into the jet aircraft passenger market in a bigger way than they have, because we all know that the Russians have had a dreadful record in the past with their aircraft, so this was vitally important to their industry,' said Tom Ballantyne, a Sydney-based aviation expert.

With a relatively low price tag of around £27.7 million, the plane had garnered around 170 orders.

Indonesia, a sprawling archipelagic nation of 240million people with a fast-growing middle class, was considered one of the biggest potential customers.

Kartika Airlines and Sky Aviation - among dozens of airlines to have popped up in Indonesia in the last decade to meet the growing demand for cheap air travel - had already ordered at least 42.

Devastation: It is feared that all those aboard the doomed flight have been killed

People involved in those plans said they were waiting for the results of the investigation before reconsidering. Most wanted to know whether the problem was mechanical or pilot error.

Indonesian
officials initially speculated there were two possibilities surrounding the fate of the
aircraft - that it had crashed or had been hijaked.

A military source in Indonesia said it was apparent that
the jet had 'fallen from the sky' after it suddenly vanished from radar screens  at an altitude of 6,200 feet over a mountainous area.

The
jet, which arrived in Indonesia on Wednesday, was on its fourth 
destination after visiting Burma, Pakistan and Kazakhstan. It was due to
continue its demonstration flights in Laos and Vietnam.

The Russian plane is described as giving the 'perfect
ride' for passengers, with four-abreast seat configuration that results in a
true business class, providing every passenger with an equal level of comfort.

A website detailing the technical side of the aircraft describes its leading-edge
technology which are said to be the core ingredient of the jet.

The technology
results in a modern, economically, efficient and globally marketable aircraft.

The
website adds: 'SSJ100 is easy and safe to pilot. The cockpit design features a 'passive' side stick and 'active' engine control levers.

'The Human Centred
Design concept perfectly arranges the control levers and on-board equipment.
SSJ100 can be landed by one pilot only.

'Dark and Quiet Cockpit offers precise,
convenient and reliable piloting of Sukhoi Superjet 100.'

The
aircraft was on a promotional tour dubbed the 'Asian Roadshow' which was aimed at lifting Russia's hopes of emerging
from its gloomy history of crashes involving ageing Soviet-era aircraft.

Indonesia's
regional carrier PT Sky Aviation has already agreed to buy 12 of the jets, with
deliveries to begin this year - but the apparent crash of the Superjet is
certain to put a hold on the contract.
