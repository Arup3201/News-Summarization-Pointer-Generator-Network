She was once known as horticultural Viagra but now, at the age of 47, Charlie Dimmock says she's too old for marriage

Charlie Dimmock's smile is as wide as it ever was. It is the smile that, along with the scarlet Botticelli curls and penchant for not wearing a bra, made her the gardening world's most famous pin-up. But it's hard to know what is behind the smile.

Time has moved on from when she was a huge TV star both here, thanks to the popularity of Ground Force which was watched by 12 million people when it moved from BBC2 to BBC1, and in the US where she hosted a gardening segment for CBS's breakfast show.

Back then, nicknamed 'horticultural Viagra' she sold more calendars than top models and pop bands. The passage from there to here hasn't been kind.

She still refuses to talk about the death of her mother and stepfather during the Boxing Day Tsunami a decade ago but it's clear its impact was huge.

For two years after she lost her beloved mum she turned down all offers of work and retreated to the New Forest house she'd been left in the will. By the time she was ready to work again the ship had sailed in the fickle world of television. There were new earthy women like Kate Humble and Sarah Beeny to obsess over.

But she insists that fame is something she's seen come and go with equanimity. 'It's quite nice to not have such a high profile although I am not sure my agent would agree,' she grins. 'I always found the fame thing a bit odd. I'd walk along the high street and find lots of people staring at me. It was intimidating; at first I would wonder whether I had left my flies undone.

'The sex symbol thing was the most surprising thing of all. It was silly, totally ridiculous. I started Ground Force when I was 33 and I hadn't been sexy until that point so I don't know how I would suddenly become sexy. So silly.

'Because of all the fuss I did get some dodgy letters. I had a marriage proposal from Australia, from some farmer in the middle of the outback. Now if people stop me in the street it's because they want to tell me, "We'd love you to bring Ground Force back". But I tell them, "We're too old". I think it's a show that was of its time; we had great fun doing it but it was a different era.'

Since then her career has veered off in all sorts of strange directions. She is still primarily a gardening expert and we are talking because she's hosting a series of presentations at the Blenheim Palace Flower Show later this month with her former Ground Force colleague Tommy Walsh, who was the construction expert on the programme. Until this year they hadn't worked together since Ground Force finished in 2005.

'We saw each other yesterday and within seconds I was nagging him and he was saying "Bloody hell, I forgot what you were like,"' she giggles.

Charlie can also now put actress down on her CV. She took a short role in the 2010 touring production of Calendar Girls, happily acknowledging 'they didn't ask me because of my acting ability'. In the show – as in the film about a group of WI activists who make a naked calendar for charity – she was forced to go nude.

'It's very well-choreographed so you can't see anything but it was still pretty nerve-racking,' she says. 'I got used to taking my clothes off – after about a month – but the acting was terrifying.' Since then she's become a panto regular. 'I lend myself to Jack And The Beanstalk very well,' she laughs. 'It's very silly but it's a good experience.'

Charlie never expected to be famous; she had her career mapped out in a very different direction. The plan was to take over the Mill Water garden centre which she already managed, near the New Forest home where she grew up. When she was picked to be the water features expert on Ground Force, after being spotted at Mill Water by a producer, she was living with long term boyfriend John Mushet but the two split when she had a fling with the show's sound man Andy Simmonds.

Mushet later said she had 'changed' after finding fame but she says now 'the relationship would never have lasted, it was already on its last legs'. That was followed by another short affair with a crew member, another sound technician called Barry Smith, but she has been pretty much single ever since.

'I'm too old now, certainly too old for marriage, there's no point,' she says. When I respond that 47 is not old – certainly not too old for love – she shakes her head.

'You're obviously too young to be cynical. I do think I'm too old now. I can't see anything happening when it comes to romance; somebody would have to really bowl me over. I am quite content without a man in my life.

Charlie Dimmock is also an acclaimed actress, having appeared in the theatre production of Calendar Girls

'I'm quite happy as I am with my cat, my dog and my horse. They're all the company I need. I think that if I did meet someone I'd prefer a partnership to marriage. That's terrible isn't it? Very selfish, that's what they say, isn't it? But I like being able to do what I want.'

Sometimes that means going to the local pub after walking her dog, occasionally dinners with friends. But more often it's being on her own, in her garden, with only a radio for company.

'I'm a Radio 4 junkie,' she laughs. 'I don't really watch any TV; radio is so much more useful in the garden. On my ideal day I might spend three or four hours in the garden. And I'll often sit outside in the evenings too, watching the birds on the bird feeders and the different creatures in the pond. There are no streetlights where I live so when the stars are out it's very pretty, you can see all the bats. It makes me feel pretty content.'

The Blenheim Palace Flower Show starts on Friday 20 June, see www.blenheimflowershow.co.uk.
