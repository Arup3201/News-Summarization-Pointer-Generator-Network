A Japanese lingerie brand has created a bra that can only be removed when its wearer is experiencing ‘true love’.

The underwear comes with a heart rate monitor that syncs with a mobile phone app which automatically unhooks the bra when the wearer’s pulse hits its so-called ‘True Love Rate’.

Manufacturer Ravijour insists the bra will not continually burst open whenever its wearer goes for a jog however, as it says the app can recognise the difference between a heart rate increase caused by exercise, and a sharp spike brought about by romantic excitement.

The bra works by monitoring heart rate increases specifically caused by hormone levels secreted by the adrenal medulla – the gland that releases adrenalin into the bloodstream.

The bra’s in-built heart monitor reacts to any increase in the wearer’s pulse rate by sending a signal to the mobile phone app via Bluetooth.

The app then monitors the changes for a few minutes to try to work out exactly what caused the increase, and when the level reaches its ‘True Love Rate’, the bra literally bursts open.

Bizarre: In an instructional video to mark the bra's launch, women are seen being pestered by various sleazy characters, including the money-brandishing 'Flash Guy' (pictured)

various sleazy characters , including the money-brandishing ‘Flash Guy’ and
 a cheating lothario called ‘The Technician’.

The men are then seen unsuccessfully attempting to unclasp a Ravijour bra as a voiceover suggests the product can ‘save’ women from unwanted sexual advances.

Various unidentified technicians, doctors and relationship experts then go on to explain exactly how the bra works and why it is such a revolutionary product.
