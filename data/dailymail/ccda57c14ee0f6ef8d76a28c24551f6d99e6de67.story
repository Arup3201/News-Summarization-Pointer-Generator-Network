A leading British motorcycle journalist has died in an accident during the press launch of a new bike in South Africa.

Kevin Ash was killed while testing BMW's R1200GS motorcycle in the rugged landscape around the town of George some 155 miles east of Cape Town.

The father-of-three wrote for a number of motor publications and was The Daily Telegraph's motorcycling correspondent for 15 years.

Tragedy: Motorcycle journalist Kevin Ash has died following an accident at a BMW event for their new bike in South Africa

According to reports, the accident happened as groups of journalists were on a two-day ride to test BMW’s new R1200GS motorbike.

On the day of the accident one 
motorcycle journalist wrote that the groups were ‘just about to head 
off-road and try out the new endure mode’.

Motorcycle.com reported that the accident is believed to have happened during the test drive. Kevin Ash was riding with a party of journalists
 and died at the scene.

An official statement released by BMW
 late last night read: 'It is with deep regret that BMW Motorrad 
confirms the fatal injury of Kevin Ash in a motorcycle accident during a
 launch event in South Africa.

'Kevin Ash passed away on January 22nd due to a motorcycle accident during a press launch in South Africa.

'The
 phrase "he died doing what he loved" sprang to mind but I would like to
 stamp that firmly out. He loved his family more and we love him.

'As his oldest daughter, I only 
recently started to fully realise just how much further his parenting 
went than most; on receiving a tearful phone call at Stanstead airport 
it was a natural response to immediately cancel his press launch and 
ride back home to teach trigonometry the night before exams.

'Everything he did was entirely for his children and his wife, and a little bit for his cat.

'My parents loved each other very much and I hope that one day we can learn to live without him.'

'The accident happened to the north of a town called George, 250 kilometres east of Cape Town.

'Out of respect for Kevin's family and friends, no further information is being made available at this time.'

Adrian Roderick, general manager for BMW Motorrad UK, said: 'We are shocked and deeply saddened to hear the awful news about Kevin Ash; one of the most well-liked, experienced and respected journalists in the extremely close-knit motorcycle community.

'Losing Kevin is a tragedy which will be felt across the entire industry. He was a friend, as much as a journalist, and will be sorely missed. Our heartfelt thoughts are with his family, friends and colleagues at this awful time.'

The roads around the town of George, which lies eight kilometres from the Indian ocean, are a mixture of tarmac and dirt tracks with one route heading into the Outeniqua mountain range.

The R1200GS is a heavy and powerful motorcycle designed for adventure touring. It is currently BMW's best selling model.

The bike was used by Ewan McGregor and Charley Boorman in the Television documentary Long Way down in which they travel from from John o' Groats in Scotland to Cape Agulhas in South Africa.

Mr Ash was a columnist for Motorcycle 
News where he had been assistant editor before leaving to work as a 
freelance writer and ran his own motorcycle news website, Ash On Bikes.

Today family, friends and colleagues paid tribute to Mr Ash and condolences flooded his website and motorbike forums.

Tony Gallagher, editor of the Daily 
Telegraph, said: ‘Kevin Ash was the doyen of motorcycle correspondents. 
Respected throughout journalism and the motorcycle trade, he was also 
one of our most admired motoring columnists and will be greatly missed 
by both Telegraph staff and readers.

Our thoughts and prayers are with his friends and family at this difficult and sad time.’

His
 daughter released the following statement on her father's website Ash 
On Bikes: 'Kevin Ash passed away due to a motorcycle accident during a 
press launch in South Africa.

'The
 phrase ‘he died doing what he loved’ sprang to mind but I would like to

'My parents loved each other very much and I hope that one day we can learn to live without him.'

In a statement on its website, Motorcycle News said it was ‘deeply saddened’ at his death.

‘Known for his technical authority, 
clarity of expression and prolific output, Kevin was also sharp-witted, 
great company, a devoted husband and father to his wife and three 
daughters and universally liked. MCN passes on our deep condolences to his family.'

A keen racer, Mr Ash worked as a motorcycle courier before getting his break in Journalism when his employer Colin Schiller launched the magazine Fast Bikes.

He then worked for the highly respected Motocycle News (MCN) publication before going freelance and becoming motorycle correspondent for the Daily Telegraph - a post which he held for a around 15 years.

Today tributes were flooding in onto his popular website Ashonbikes.com.

One user Markyboyzx6r posted: 'Absolute numbing shock to hear such terrible news. I’m so sorry to all of Kevin’s family, colleagues and friends.

'Kevin was a fantastic journalist. He had the ability to write about the finer technical details of motorcycle engineering and make it understandable and interesting for non-technical people like me.

'His columns in the Telegraph were always highly informed, free from hyperbole and honest. But it was on this site ashonbikes, that I really got to know Kev - his basic niceness, his enthusiasm for biking and good bloke status were always clear to see.

'He always took the time to contribute to discussions, was helpful to all readers and his helpfulness made this a very civilised place to post ideas. 

And user KurtVerbose wrote: 'I shall really miss his articles as there's no other motorcycle journalist who writes with such intelligence and insight.'
