The girl walked back to the library after the incident and called the police.

The group of men, described as African in appearance and aged about 20 years old, were last seen walking toward a Macquarie Street shopping centre.

Detectives are calling for anyone with information to come forward.

The attack follows two similar assaults in Sydney's west this year.

In February, a girl was allegedly the victim of a pack rape in a Doonside park and four teenagers were charged over the attack.

Meanwhile two months later, two teenage girls were coaxed off a Sydney train and raped in a Fairfield park.
