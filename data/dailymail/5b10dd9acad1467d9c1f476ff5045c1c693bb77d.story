An 80-year-old man has been found guilty of storing 38 dead cats in his freezer because he wanted 'their spirits to be with him forever'. 

When animal welfare inspectors turned up at Donald Cruickshank's Auckland home, in New Zealand, in 2010, they were horrified by the disgusting conditions they came face to face with.

Masses of dead felines covered in bloodied newspaper and bags were discovered stored next to the pensioner's food in his freezer, the New Zealand Herald reports.

Meanwhile, the stench of faeces from 19 living cats running around his lounge and bedroom overpowered officers.

The SPCA found 17 more cats locked in cages and another 23 were housed in squalid conditions in the man's locked apartment below.

In total there were around 50 cats in his home, besides the 38 dead ones in his freezer.

Cruickshank was charged with failing to care for his pets and was sentenced in the Auckland District Court on Friday by Judge Russell Collins.

The grey-haired cat hoarder was handed 40 hours of community work and a $100 fine.

Although he won't be able to own any more cats, he has been allowed to keep the three he currently owns with the condition that SPCA officers will continue to monitor their welfare.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted SPCA Auckland for comment.

 Cruickshank's co-accused will appear in court next month.
