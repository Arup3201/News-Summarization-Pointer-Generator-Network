Logan Wood tragically died after an accident on his motorbike at a motocross track near Rochdale

A 12-year-old boy described as an 'adrenaline junkie' was killed in a motocross accident in front of his father as he completed a high 'leap' on his bike for the first time.

Logan Wood had been striving to achieve the 15-foot jump on his KTM 65cc bike at a designated track supervised by marshals but, when he finally achieved the stunt, he lost control and was thrown off the machine.

Logan's father Edward, 42, was watching from his van when the accident happened and rushed over to cradle his son in his arms.

He told his son he had completed the jump in the hope of comforting him, but the youngster had suffered fatal chest injuries and died later in hospital.

An inquest was told that Logan, from Oswaldwistle near Accrington, Lancashire had been riding quad bikes since the age of nine after his dad got one from a friend at work.

Mr Wood said his son had got 'really good on his quad bike' and had 'nagged' for a motorbike.

In October 2013, Logan's parents had decided that they would buy him one for Christmas. The inquest heard that the bike was dismantled and put into boxes to be opened Christmas day.

Mr Wood, who grew up around motorcycles and cars, told the inquest that he and his son then worked alongside each other to put the machine back together.

By February this year, Logan was attending the motocross track at Cown Quarry in Whitworth, near Rochdale most Saturdays.

His father said: 'He would get a little bit more confident with gear changing. He was always supervised.'

Mr Wood added that he had told his son, who always wore a helmet, that if he ever lost control of the bike to 'get the bike as far away' by standing on the pegs and pushing it away.

Mr Wood said the circuit was 'a well marked out track with no room to go the wrong way' and was well supervised.

He added: '[Logan] would always come up to the straight and check if anyone was behind him. He was very conscious if other people were around him.

'He was getting much more confident on the bike and always striving to get to the top of that jump. Maybe he was trying that little bit harder which he did always. He wanted to push himself that little bit more.'

On October 1, the schoolboy rode on the track with no other riders after a month's break from the motorsport.

Mr Wood told the inquest he approached 'a big jump' differently from usual.

He said: 'He would go up the first part of the jump, leave the ground and land both wheels on the incline. He was going a little bit quicker than he had been doing.

'The bike didn't seem to accelerate until three quarters along the stretch. I can't explain, whether he backed off or there was an issue with the bike accelerator at the base of the jump.'

Logan's  father, Edward, said his son approached a jump differently from usual before the crash

Mr Wood told the inquest that he landed at the top of the 15ft hill but did not veer to the left as planned and the machine crashed causing Logan to lose his helmet. Mr Wood ran  towards his son and did what he could to save him.

He tearfully told the inquest that as he tended to his son he told him that he had made the jump.

PC Robert Newcombe who investigated the tragedy said there had been no concerns about the course and said: 'It was marked out clearly which way you had to travel and there are tyres around the track.

'Marshals checked Logan before riding, they seem to be very committed to improving people on motorbikes.'

He added that Logan's bike had no defects and brakes and steering were working correctly.

PC Newcombe added: 'For some reason or other Logan seems to have lost control. I think he has possibly become a little over confident.

'He was the only person on the track at the time, perhaps he has gone a little too fast, got to the top of the hill, perhaps beyond his capability to resolve it, it bends sharply to the left.

'He has gone up the hill and gone down instead of going round left, he has virtually gone straight off instead of going round the bend.'

Logan was riding a KTM 65cc, like that pictured, which he had been given for Christmas when he crashed

He added that although Logan's helmet was fastened underneath it had been loose and had come off.

But, he said, the loss of the helmet had not been a contributory factor in his death.

Coroner Mr Richard Taylor recorded a verdict of accidental death and said: 'He was doing something he loved and he was getting better at it. We will never know really what happened.

'It is a best guess that he did become more confident, in you telling me he was asking 'where did I land' and 'how far did I get'.

'It is quite easy to misjudge that. He would probably have been proud that he landed at the top. Sadly he lost control after he landed. As a result of that it was fatal.

'There's no criticism of the bike, the course, the marshals, there's no criticism of Logan. He was an enthusiastic young man.'

In a statement Logan's family said: 'He was tragically taken from us doing what he loved the most, riding his motorbike.

'He was a real outdoors boy if he wasn't playing sport he would be out on his BMX or scooter showing off the tricks he could do - a real adrenaline junkie.'

The accident happened at Cown Quarry in Whitworth, near Rochdale in October. A coroner said nobody was to blame, adding: 'There's no criticism of the bike, the course, the marshals, there's no criticism of Logan'
