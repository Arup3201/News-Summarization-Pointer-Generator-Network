A judge warned foreign criminals yesterday that Britain is not a ‘soft touch’ as he jailed a Romanian gang for a £1million theft campaign.

The ten gang members exploited EU border laws to travel freely between Romania and the UK purely to steal high-quality gold from Turkish and Indian jewellery shops.

The ‘professional’ criminals aged between 20 and 30 were chastised by Old Bailey Judge Timothy Pontius for not having done ‘an honest day’s work while they were here’.

The gang of Romanian armed robbers, sentenced to a total of 82 years for six jewellery shop robberies, can be seen here emptying the glass cabinets having smashed into them with a sledgehammer.  Members of staff  can be seen kneeling on the floor as the shop's alarms billow out thick smoke, with little effect

This robbery shows one of the thieves holding a door open to prevent it from being locked shut while another smashes through an inner door with a sledgehammer 

They were handed sentences totalling 82 years and ten months for seven ruthless raids between March and September last year.

One of the gang, Ovidiu Gabor, 25, had
told police when he was arrested: ‘I don’t care, I go to prison to go 
on holiday.’ He got seven years. All will  be deported after they have 
served their sentences.

It is believed most of the gang, some 
of whom giggled and smirked in the dock, travelled to Britain using 
tourist visas before settling illegally on a makeshift campsite on 
wasteland in Romford, Essex.

When Romania joined the EU in 2007 its
citizens were granted freedom to travel to Britain, with restrictions 
on the number who could legally settle here.

Judge Pontius acknowledged there are 
fears there will be an influx of Romanians when restrictions on the 
number who can move to Britain are lifted from January 1.

He added that some believe this could affect the ‘availability of jobs to our own nationals’ and lead to a rise in crime.

He warned: ‘Anyone who comes to the 
UK – irrespective of what part of the world – wanting to commit serious 
crime, must clearly understand such abuse of the hospitality of this 
country and its people must be seriously punished.

'No one should think for a moment that
courts in the UK will be a soft touch. Sentences such as these must be 
seen as a powerful and effective deterrent not only to home-grown but 
also imported criminals.’

In the raids, one smartly dressed gang member would gain entry to a jewellery shop by buzzing the intercom.

He would then hold the door open for the rest to storm in wielding sledgehammers and seize large quantities of gold.

The gang pleaded guilty to conspiracy to rob. They netted more than £1.1million, only £135,580 of which has been recovered.

In March last year, £500,000 of goods was taken from a shop in Wembley, North London, which was ‘trashed’.

A month later, part of a £248,648 haul
was found in a hole which the gang had dug to hide evidence near a shop
in Ilford, Essex. In August, £341,435 of goods was taken from a shop in
East Ham, East London.

On September 15, by which time police
were watching their campsite, officers saw the gang force their way 
into Sabha jewellers in Turnpike Lane, North London.

They were arrested as they tried to leave with £62,587 worth of jewellery.

Gabor had attacked an elderly customer
with a sledgehammer to knock him to the ground. When asked about the 
attack he replied: ‘F*** him. I’m not interested.’

Apart from Gabor, Marius Barbu, 25, 
Vasile Batarga, 23, Ioan Gavrilit, 26, and Iulian Culba, 22, were each 
jailed for nine years and four months.

Iulian Roman, 21, was jailed for nine 
years and six months which included a concurrent sentence of seven years
for a £1million raid on a jeweller’s in February last year.

Constantin Irina, 30, was jailed for 
eight years, and Georghe Macovei, 23, for seven years. Puiu-Danut 
Paunescu, 26, was jailed for seven years and three months, and Catalin 
Paise, 20, for six years and nine months.

Only a fraction of their haul had been recovered from the six raids or attempted raids - leaving the robbers with £1 million 

Judge Pontius said there were fears an influx of people from Romania and Bulgaria when restrictions are lifted next year would lead to an increase in crime
