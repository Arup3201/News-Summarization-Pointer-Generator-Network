A man has filed a lawsuit in California claiming that he is the biological father of tragic teen suicide victim Audrie Pott and therefore should be part of any financial wrongful death lawsuit.

Michael Lazarin, 46, claimed on Wednesday in Santa Clara County Superior Court in San Jose that Sheila and Lawrence Pott, the teenager's legal parents, falsely claimed to be Audrie's sole heir's in the suit they lodged one year ago

Lazarin claims he was involved in a relationship with Sheila from 1995 to 2003 while she separated from her then-husband and had that Lawrence is not Audrie's biological father.

Paternity claim: Michael Lazarin has filed a lawsuit in which he alleges he is the real father of tragic teenager Audrie Pott, who ended her own life in September, 2012, after cyberbullying

Audrie Pott ended her life when she was 15-years-old after she hanged herself at her mother's home on September 10, 2012, dying two days later.

The teenager had become distraught after a Labor Day weekend party at a friends house after partygoers allegedly sexually assaulted her and spread pictures of the attack.

At the party the had drunk vodka mixed with gatorade and passed out in the bedroom of a friend and woke up without her shorts on.

While she was unconscious, three teenage boys who were classmates at Saratoga High School, removed her clothes, used a pen to draw offensive messages on her body, took photographs on their cellphones and then abused her by 'digital penetration.'

The boys pleaded guilty to sexual assault and two were sentenced to 30 days in juvenile hall in January, while the third was sentenced to 45 consecutive days.

Lawrence and Sheila Pott filed their suit on April 15, 2013, against the parents of the unidentified boys involved for financial compensation.

According to NBC Bay Area, they want damages for defamation, invasion of privacy, false imprisonment, battery, sexual battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress and conspiracy.

They are also suing another unnamed teenage girl who allegedly helped Audrie to the bedroom and watched the boys.

In his lawsuit, Lazarin attached dozens of photographs of him, Audrie, Sheila and his family members taken in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

He also attached an email from September 23 sent to his former lawyer, Gloria Allred from the Pott's attorney, Robert Allard.

In it, Allard describes him as 'nothing more than a sperm donor.'

He also provided Facebook messages written to him by Lawrence Pott's second wife, Lisa, in 2011, that he claims acknowledge he is Audrie's father.

He said that if he is successful he expects to be included in the Pott's lawsuit.

He said to NBC Bay Area, his intention in filing suit is not for money but 'to bring closure to me and my family.

'The devastating effects have been far reaching and difficult to cope with as I have watched my daughter become a public spectacle because of the criminal actions that took place before her passing, the horrendous defilement of her by the boys who did not receive due punishment for what they had done,' he said.

Lazarin said that when he met Sheila, she was 'going through an extensive divorce' from Lawrence.

He said that Sheila gave birth to Audrie in 1997 and that he was involved in her upbringing up until Sheila and him separated in December 2003.

After that he filed a paternity claim.

However, he lost because then-Judge Dolores Carr said that he had missed a two-year statute of limitations to claim paternity, nor did he claim it while he was living with Sheila.

'I was in a full blown relationship with my daughter and Sheila,' he said. 'Why would I sue somebody? I knew it was my daughter.'

In a court filing in 2006, Sheila Pott's lawyer Mary Simpson wrote that the Potts were married in 1992 and Lawrence Pott filed for divorce in 2001 but it did not became final until 2004.

Simpson said that Sheila, while still legally married to Lawrence Pott, had an affair with Lazarin between April and September 1996, prior to Audrie's birth on May 27, 1997.
