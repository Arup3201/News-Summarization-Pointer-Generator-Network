Martin Sibley, 48, was found dead at his home in Colchester, Essex, hours after being questioned by police investigating an alleged sex abuse scandal

A fireman was found hanged hours after being questioned by detectives over a sex abuse scandal.

Martin Sibley, 48, whose body was discovered at his home, is believed to have killed himself.

The father-of-two was one of up to 100 people being questioned as part of an investigation into Essex County Fire and Rescue Service.

Police are examining claims that recruits were subjected to ‘wild initiation ceremonies’ in the 1970s and 1980s.

Sources claim that in some cases young men were stripped naked and sexually assaulted using a feather duster.

But Essex Police refused to say whether officers spoke to Mr Sibley – who joined the service in 1989 – as a potential suspect, victim or witness.

Mr Sibley was found hanged on Monday at his £200,000 home in Colchester, Essex, shortly after detectives from the force’s serious crime unit visited it to interview him.

The force recently launched a wide-ranging inquiry into ‘historical allegations of serious criminal offences’ in the Essex fire service.

One source close to the fire service said: ‘In the Eighties, people were directed to strip naked and people went along the line playing with feather dusters. It didn’t happen everywhere, but it wasn’t rare either. They were initiations, but they were not right.’

During his 24 years in the fire service, Mr Sibley had served across Essex. In 2009, he was awarded a long service and good conduct medal.

He travelled to China four years ago to raise money for a firemen’s charity after recovering from life-threatening injuries he suffered in a motorcycle accident.

The fireman lived alone after 
splitting from his wife Lynn several years ago. She was too upset to 
speak yesterday as she was consoled by their daughters Holly, 18, and 
Millie, 15, who live with her.

Mr Sibley’s death was originally 
referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission, but will now 
be dealt with by Essex Police.

A spokesman for the force said: 
‘Police are investigating the circumstances but his death is not being 
treated as suspicious at this time.

‘The force had referred his death to 
the Independent Police Complaints Commission, as the man had been spoken
to by police officers shortly before his death on Monday.

‘The IPCC have considered the matter and are satisfied for the force to investigate the circumstances locally.’

Questioned: It is not clear why Martin Sibley, pictured on a charity walk in China, was interviewed in connection with the investigation

Mr Sibley’s neighbour Marianna Lague, 
47, said she had been left stunned by his sudden death. ‘There had been 
nothing to suggest this was coming,’ she said.

‘Martin had been in good spirits 
whenever I saw him recently. He was a really nice chap. He was the kind 
of person that if you needed help he would be there for you.’

Alan Chin-Shaw, of the Essex Fire 
Brigade Union, said: ‘Essex firefighters have been left shocked and 
saddened by the death of a long-serving and widely-respected colleague.’

Allegations of violent and bullying initiation ceremonies dogged fire services across the country in the 1970s and 1980s.

Recruits complained of being forced to
shout obscenities and wear boots filled with water, and of having 
buckets of urine tipped over them.
