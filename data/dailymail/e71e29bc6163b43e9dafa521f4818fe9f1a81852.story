Two centuries might separate their great seafaring triumphs, and in terms of speed and agility, the vessels they commanded may well be beyond all compare.

Yet given the way Sir Ben Ainslie almost single-handedly inspired his bedraggled and outclassed team to victory in the world’s oldest and most prestigious yacht race on Wednesday, experts were pondering a rather unlikely question: is he the greatest British sailor since Nelson?

It might sound somewhat far-fetched, but for those who weren’t fortunate enough to witness on TV what is being hailed as the greatest sporting comeback of all time, the facts are these.

Thrilled: Sir Ben Ainslie triumphantly holds up the America's Cup trophy after the Oracle Team USA won the sailing race in San Francisco on Thursday

Having invested a cool £120 million of his fortune in attempting to retain the America’s Cup, billionaire computer tycoon Larry Ellison had watched forlornly as his turbo-charged super-boat, crewed by an elite team of 11 international yachtsmen hired on megabucks salaries, were blown out of the water by their New Zealand opponents.

Ellison’s Oracle Team USA lost race after race in the series, and by mid-September their humiliation was almost complete.

Having won eight of the nine completed races, their challengers, Emirates Team New Zealand (whose budget was less than half of Oracle’s), needed to clinch just one more victory to claim the coveted 162-year-old cup in front of more than a million spectators in San Francisco Bay. It seemed a mere formality.

Speed machine: The Oracle catamaran, which boasts carbon-fibre sails designed by a Boeing engineer, has a hull length the same size as two London buses and the same width as a three-lane motorway

But then something quite extraordinary happened. Something which surpasses perhaps even Ian Botham’s legendary match-winning innings to snatch victory for England in the 1981 Ashes Test at Headingley.

In desperation, Ellison sacked his tactician, an acclaimed yacht-racing genius named John Kostecki, who had made a series of errors, and replaced him with Ainslie, who had been included in Oracle’s team only to sail their trial boats, and — having won four Olympic gold medals in a very different form of sailing — was not considered experienced enough to play a major part in the America’s Cup.

It must be said that mega-rich American Ellison also spent millions more on redesigning his yacht’s aerodynamics — reputedly seeking advice from top technicians at aircraft giant Boeing — yet it was undoubtedly the dramatic intervention of the bearded 36-year-old Falmouth mariner that turned the tide.

Billionaire backing: The Oracle was bankrolled by software tycoon Larry Ellison, who ploughed a staggering £120million into his America's Cup campaign. The catamaran itself cost £7million

Drafted in with Oracle still five points down, he set about assessing every aspect of his boat’s performance, digesting data from a computer worn on his wrist.

He also excelled in his key role of studying the opposition and drawing up an effective attack plan in a split-second; but such is his innate seafaring brilliance that the high-powered engineers also consulted Ainslie — who learned to sail at his father’s side in a dinghy bobbing about in the Channel when he was eight years old — about the key design modifications.

The transformation was remarkable. Oracle won one race, then another . . . and another; and on Wednesday when they glided past the Golden Gate Bridge to thrash a desperate and disbelieving New Zealand crew by 44 seconds, Ainslie was given the honour of taking the wheel to steer the victorious yacht back to its moorings.

All along the shoreline, the Stars and Stripes fluttered, for officially this was another great American victory. In truth, however, nobody among the joyous crowd was in any doubt that it was a triumph for Britain.

‘Ben didn’t do it all his own, it was a great team effort, but he really changed the course of the race series,’ said Bob Fisher, author of the definitive book on America’s Cup history, who watched the thrilling spectacle unfold.

Comparison: Sir Ben has been hailed as Britain's greatest sailing hero since Napoleonic War captain Lord Horatio Nelson

‘There is no doubt he is the best sailor we have ever had in Britain, and though one was a great battle commander and the other a great sportsman, I actually think it’s quite fair to compare him with Lord Nelson, because both were tactically brilliant and their skills transcend the centuries, even given the huge changes in technology.

‘Nelson used his skill and cunning to split the French fleet at Trafalgar by sailing at them at right-angles, rather than sailing alongside them (the conventional way of doing battle in those days).

‘Ben has been sailing since he was a kid and he’s absorbed so much knowledge. He has become a master at reading the wind and knowing the currents. They were skills he used to great effect in helping Oracle to pull off this amazing comeback, and Britain should be very proud of him.’

Indeed we should, but Ainslie himself says he won’t be satisfied until he brings the America’s Cup to Britain, which staged the inaugural race against the U.S. schooner America, after which the contest is named, off the Isle of Wight in 1851.

Yet, despite many glorious — and highly expensive — tilts, we have never yet managed to win it.

Despite all the millions it would take to mount a credible challenge, the remarkable events of this week have brought the dream closer. For the world’s top crewmen will surely now clamour to sail in a yacht guided by the great Briton — who recently acquired the requisitely wealthy sponsor, bankers JP Morgan.

Given a following wind, therefore, we might soon see Sir Ben steering his victorious course along the Channel. Why, perhaps, in years to come, he’ll even be on a plinth in Trafalgar Square.
