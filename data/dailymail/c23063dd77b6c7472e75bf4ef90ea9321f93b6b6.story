Barack Obama sought to make his newfound enthusiasm for gay marriage a campaign issue as he appeared on The View to defend his much-talked-about announcement.

In an interview set to air tomorrow, the President told the hosts of the ABC daytime chat show that the controversial debate would be 'a big contrast in the campaign' against Republican Mitt Romney.

Mr Obama announced, 'I think same-sex couples should be able to get married,' during another ABC interview last Wednesday.

The historic declaration is intended to fire up liberal activists who consider gay marriage to be a hugely symbolic social issue.

It is believed that one in six of the President's donation 'bundlers' for his re-election campaign is gay, and many of his supporters have been enthusiastic about Mr Obama's record on gay rights.

But he faces a backlash from socially conservative black pastors, some of whom are warning that it could cost him the White House in November.

Mr Romney opposes same-sex marriage but has been relatively silent on the issue over the last week, as senior Republicans have insisted the election should focus on economic rather than social issues.

Mr Obama told The View: 'This is going to be a big contrast in the campaign, because you’ve got Governor Romney saying we should actually have a constitutional amendment installing the notion that you can’t have same-sex marriages.'

He added: 'This is something that historically had been determined at the state level and part of my believing ultimately that civil unions weren’t sufficient, and I’ve been a longtime supporter of civil unions for same-sex couples, was partly because of the issue of Social Security benefits and other laws.'

Ron Paul, Mitt Romney's last remaining challenger for the Republican presidential nomination, announced on Monday that he would no longer campaign.

The maverick libertarian will not contest the upcoming primaries, but has urged his supporters to stay involved in politics.

A number of state GOP conventions have been dominated by Mr Paul's fans, who have squeezed out followers of Mr Romney in several places.

In a message to his supporters, the Texas congressman wrote of his pride in delaying Mr Romney's nomination.

'Moving forward, however, we will no longer spend resources campaigning in primaries in states that have not yet voted,' Mr Paul added.

'Doing so with any hope of success would take many tens of millions of dollars we simply do not have.

'I encourage all supporters of liberty to make sure you get to the polls and make your voices heard, particularly in the local, state and congressional elections, where so many defenders of freedom are fighting and need your support.'

Mr Romney is on track to capture the nomination this month. He has 973 of the 1,144 delegates required to formally become the GOP's nominee, while Rick Santorum has 264 and Newt Gingrich has 130. Mr Paul trails with 104 delegates.

Mr Paul, who is leaving Congress after the next election, is unlikely to endorse Mr Romney as the party's nominee.

The pair strongly clashed during the debates over foreign policy, and in interviews Mr Paul has refused to say he would champion Mr Romney's campaign.

The President said he thought the Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage as being between a man and a woman, was unconstitutional, but did not reveal whether he would fight to repeal it.

'Congress is clearly on notice that I think it's a bad idea,' he said.

Two hours after his announcement last Wednesday, Mr Obama held a telephone conference call with eight black ministers to explain the rationale behind the move.

Several told the president that he stand on gay marriage might make it difficult for them to support him and could endanger his re-election.

‘They were wrestling with their ability to get over his theological position,’ said the Reverend Delman Coates, the pastor of Mount Ennon Baptist Church in Clinton, Maryland, who took part in the call.

Speaking at his Rising Sun Baptist 
Church in Baltimore on Sunday, the Reverend Emmett Burns told the 
congregation that he would abstain from voting in November.

He
told CNN: ‘People are saying that they don't support this, they don't 
like this, they're disappointed with the President and they're planning 
to stay home.’

The 
decision to back gay marriage was, he said, a message to his ‘base’ of 
voters: ‘I am going against your beliefs and your thoughts.’

Pastor Harry Jackson, from Hope 
Christian Church in Beltsville, Maryland told WJZ television: ‘God said 
in every home, there needs to be a representation of his glory through 
manhood and femininity.’

Father
Erik Arnold of Our Lady of Perpetual Help in Ellicott City, Maryland, 
who is white, said of Mr Obama’s announcement: ‘I think it might be a 
call to action for people to really express what they believe.’

Others
said that their views as pastors should not affect the rights of the 
population at large. ‘To me, this is an issue of the separation of 
church and state,’ Pastor Coates told WJZ.

‘We should not allow our subjective theological understandings prevent other citizens of this country from having equal rights.

Mr Obama was elected in 2008 partly 
on the back of overwhelming black support and very high turnout among 
minority groups. But polls show that 49 per cent of blacks oppose gay 
marriage, compared to 43 per cent of whites.

Although
this proportion is slowly reducing, in line with all Americans, and 
blacks are unlikely to vote for Mr Romney in large numbers, Democrats 
fear that Mr Obama’s new stance could depress turnout.

Religious conservatives see an opportunity. ‘I think the president this past week took six or seven states he carried in 2008 and put them in play with this one ill-conceived position that he’s taken,’ Gary Bauer, a former Republican presidential candidate, told CNN.

Tony Perkins, president of the conservative Family Research Council, said on the same programme: ‘I’ve gotten calls from pastors across the nation, white and black pastors, who have said, "You know what? I’m not sitting on the sidelines anymore."’

The Romney campaign, however, is anxious to avoid getting drawn into a prolonged debate about the issue, believing that a relentless focus on the economy will benefit them most.

At an address at the evangelical Liberty University in Virginia on Saturday, Mr Romney made uttered only one short sentence regarding the controversy: ‘Marriage is a relationship between one man and one woman.’
