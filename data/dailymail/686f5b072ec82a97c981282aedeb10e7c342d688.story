Despite the national obsession with cookery programmes, British cooks now spend just 38 minutes preparing the evening meal - down from an hour in 1980 and 100 minutes in 1960.

What's more, although Nigella, Jamie and Hugh remain as popular as ever, a new survey looking at the national attitude to food found that more take inspiration from their parents' culinary repertoire than from the efforts of TV super-chefs.

More than half of those questioned said that their family was their biggest source of gastronomic inspiration, possibly because for six in 10, their parents also taught them how to cook.

Time was less of a luxury in the 1960s, when one could spend more than an hour and a half cooking dinner

The survey of 2,000 people found almost 60 per cent of women 
say they were inspired to start cooking by their parents, a third take ideas from 
their friends, one fifth from their grandparents and one in 20 are 
influenced by the recipes their children learn at school.

Men 
seek their inspiration from other sources, with more than a third using 
recipes from cookery books, one in five taking mealtime inspiration from
travelling abroad and almost one fifth (17 per cent) attempting dishes 
they've tried in restaurants.

But despite Britain's increasingly adventurous chefs, the Sunday
roast remains the nation's favourite meal, with two 
thirds regularly reaching for the roasting tray.

Curry also remains a popular choice although it was beaten into third place by Spaghetti Bolognese  and was closely followed by another British 
classic - bangers and mash.

Tulisa shared a picture of her evening meal on Instagram in March

But contemporary cooking isn't all about aping the older generation and tucking into classic dishes.

20 per cent said they not only share their dinner with friends but also with online acquaintances by posting 
pictures of food on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.

Social networking at suppertime increases to 50 per cent in the 18-24 age bracket, perhaps inspired by A-list food fans such as Tulisa Contostavlos, 25, who shared a picture of a mammoth Chinese supper in March on Instagram.

Although almost 40 per cent of us eat supper with other people, more than a quarter of British people read while they eat, whether the paper or on their Kindle or iPad, while a quarter like to check their phones.

The award for the most sociable 
diners goes to the East Anglians who sit down together seven times a 
week (45 per cent), while Londoners, at the opposite end of the spectrum, are the 
loneliest diners, with one in 10 always eating solo.         

We cut cooking time so we can spend more time with family, do chores, go to the gym or watch TV

The report also found that increasing numbers
are looking for help and inspiration to cut down on the amount of time 
they spend preparing meals.

On average, the main cook in the household 
spends 38 minutes in the kitchen preparing the evening meal, 
considerably less than 50 years ago. One in four claim they couldn't live without bottled cooking sauces.

Women
look for convenient cooking 
solutions in order to spend more time with family or to do chores (almost 15 per 
cent), while 15 per cent of men want more time to go to the gym or watch 
TV.

Nevertheless, the survey also found a positive attitude to
cooking, with 65 per cent of us admitting to enjoying food preparation, with many considering it a 
hobby rather than a chore.

Britain's top three dinners are spaghetti bolognese, roast dinner and bangers and mash

The oldest and youngest in society are the 
most enthusiastic when it comes to home cooking, with almost three 
quarters describing it as an enjoyable pastime.

Food historian Caroline Yeldham comments: 'As a nation, we've embraced cooking as a hobby - having fun, 
sharing food and turning a meal into a social occasion.

'A younger Come 
Dine With Me generation has developed, and supper clubs where people 
pay to go out to dine in at someone's home have emerged.'

Emma
Evison, General Manager at Mars Food UK which conducted the survey, said: 'The report sheds a 
light on the eating habits of the nation and has provided some 
interesting insight into the evolution of the dinner table and how our 
eating habits have changed over the past five decades.

'As our lives 
become increasingly busy and time is considered a precious commodity, 
it's clear from the research that we're reaching for products we can 
trust to create great tasting enjoyable nutritious meals quickly and 
easily.'
