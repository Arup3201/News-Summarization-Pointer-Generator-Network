He sold his entire life – car, home, job and friends – on eBay, in search of the adventure of a lifetime.

When Ian Usher's marriage broke up, he was determined to start afresh, travelling the world before settling down on his own Caribbean island.

But five years after his life-changing decision, the 49-year-old is at it again- selling, in an online auction, his life in a tropical paradise.

A fresh start: After building his idyllic home on a beautiful island, the adventurous man is ready for another trip

For less than a price of a London home, you could be sitting on this jetty a world away from the average office job

For £160,000, ($250,000) less than half the price of the average London home, Mr Usher is offering his life on the private island, off the coast of Panama. The affordable opportunity is already listed on his website 'Caribbean Life 4 Sale'.

Mr Usher, who is originally from Darlington, was devastated when wife Laura left him six years after they emigrated to Perth in Western Australia,

He made £192,000 from the sale of his three bedroom house in Perth, and all its contents, including a car, and a jet ski.

Now Ian, who has re-married, plans to start a new life, after he quit his life in Perth to travel the world

Beats rainy England! The tropical setting could be yours for around £160,000 if you decide to follow in Ian's footsteps and jack in the day job

Ian Usher refused to let a devastating divorce get him down

With the proceeds he travelled the world, armed with nothing but a list of life-goals.

For two years he lived life to the max, ticking off all but a handful of life experiences on a bucket list of 100.

He met Richard Branson, acted in a Hollywood film and learned to fly a plane.

He even found love, with a Canadian woman called Moe that he met on his travels, before buying and setting up home on the island near the border with Costa Rica.

The complete Caribbean life comes with the wooden home he built from scratch, motor boats and dug out canoes for exploring the island.

The house is solar-powered with rainwater collected on the roof and contains everything a prospective buyer would need in his new life.

Exotic fruit grows on the island and fresh seafood arrives 'still flapping' by boat from other islands.

Chicken roaming the mangroves provide free range eggs.

The new owner will be able to take advantage of first class diving and snorkelling.

Mr Usher says he has relished spending time there with his partner and her two children, but is now seeking a new challenge.

He said: 'It's a beautiful place, but the traveller's itchy feet are starting to tickle again.

'I still have a long list of places I want to see, and I can't do that if I'm lounging in a hammock on the balcony sipping a margarita. 

The Caribbean island home that is offered for sale is in the province of Bocas del Toro, which is situated in the north west corner of Panama

Ian Usher is now trying to tempt people to follow in his footsteps and live the exotic life in Central America

Ian Usher's island is remote and peaceful, with a friendly community and the promise of reasonable restaurants

The country is the most southern in Central America

'Heading to Panama to start a new life there was again a big step into the unknown. But life here has become easy and comfortable.'

Life in the tropics although magical is not without its stresses, he emphasises.

The island is fringed rather than picture postcard sandy beaches, he warns. Any new owner should be aware that thefts are common.

And dreamy sunsets are disturbed by the presence of stinging tropical midge-like insects called chitras.

But at least the buyer can expect a warm welcome from the community.

Mr Usher wrote: 'For me, one of the most wonderful aspects of living down here is the mix of people that live here, or have come here to make a fresh start for themselves. The blend of local Panamanians, indigenous Indians and gringo ex-pats makes for a very intersting lifestyle and social circle.

'Through building here I have met many of the local Panamanian people, both in work situations, and socially, and have found them to be very open, friendly and fun-loving people. '

Once a buyer is found Mr Usher plans to buy a sailing boat and explore the Caribbean.

The film rights to his incredible story have, unsurprisingly, already been snapped up by Disney.

Property: the buyer will get a 2.2 acre Caribbean island home off the coast of Panama, in the tropical archipelago of Bocas del Toro.There is a two-bedroom house on the island with rainwater collection and solar power. There are also two wooden docks, a solid dock made from rocks, a large storage shed, two boads and a couple of kayukus (local style canoes)

Peace and privacy: To reach the mainland or the capital of Panama, the owner can get a speedboat water-taxi or fly - so there'll be no busy motorway built outside their front door.

Price: The money would not be enough to buy even an average-sized terraced house in London, so they would get more for their money.

Food: Fresh fish at bargain prices along with cheap restaurants would make this place a dream for anyone who enjoys dining out or seafood

Economy: With an unemployment rate of 2.7 per cent, a mushrooming tourism industry and an economic boom, Panama is flourishing.
