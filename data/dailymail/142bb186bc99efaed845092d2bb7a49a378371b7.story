The Budget has failed to provide a Tory bounce – but if the economy stays on track until the Election, David Cameron could still win.

Labour is four points ahead of the Conservatives, but would be out of sight by now if the party had a better leader than Ed Miliband.

Astonishingly, if the Election was a presidential style head to head, more than one in eight Labour voters would choose Mr Cameron.

A total of 13 per cent of Labour supporters opted for Cameron, but only 2 per cent of Tories choose Miliband.

The Survation poll carried out for The Mail on Sunday shows Labour on 34 points, the Tories on 30, Ukip on 17 and the Lib Dems on ten.

A total of 1,008 people took part in the online survey on Friday and Saturday. Asked to choose between the Tories and Labour, Labour clearly wins. 

But when voters are asked to choose between Cameron and Miliband, Cameron wins by 42 per cent to 33.

There have recently been claims by some Tory MPs that the Budget was ‘too dull’, and Australian-born Election guru Lynton Crosby has been criticised by Ministers including Michael Gove and Iain Duncan Smith for ‘lack of vision’. 

But the poll suggests that his strategy, which relies on a late pro-Tory swing by voters worried that Labour will wreck the recovery, could yet work.

A total of 16 per cent of non-Tory voters say they could still change their mind and vote Conservative if the economy stays on track.

Following the Chancellor’s decision to help pay for celebrations to mark the 600th anniversary of the Battle of Agincourt, where Henry V defeated the French, voters were asked which of the four main leaders would have done best in the battle. 

Excluding the ‘don’t knows’, Ukip leader Nigel Farage won – scoring 44 – followed by Cameron on 32, Miliband on 16 and Clegg coming in last on only eight.
