Fashion retailer American Apparel has agreed to pay $1million after a worker was crushed and 'mangled' a worker in a California factory. 

Tuan Phan, 49, was trying to clean a large knitting machine on August 19, 2011 in Garden Grove, Orange County when it started accidentally. 

The company agreed to pay $1million following Mr Phan's death, including $150,000 to his daughter.

American Apparel agreed to pay $1m after worker Tuan Phan was mangled by a knitting machine in 2011

According to Orange County Deputy District Attorney Kelly Roosevelt: 'At the time of the incident American Apparel utilised specific knitting machines, which must be disconnected from the main power supply before maintenance, as they may inadvertently start and the operator may be drawn into the machine. 

'The machines are also required by law to be locked to prevent persons from entering and tagged to indicate that maintenance is being performed, also known as lock-out/tag-out procedures. Workers must be sufficiently trained to employ necessary precautions to avoid serious injury.

'On August 19, 2011, a knitting machine in an American Apparel facility in Garden Grove was undergoing maintenance, and was turned off but still connected to a power source. The machine was not tagged out, as required, and individuals were not properly trained to de-energise the machines. 

'As a result, when employee Tuan Phan entered the machine cage, the machine re-started and Phan was subsequently mangled and killed by the machine.' 

DDA Roosevelt said California labour law was designed that employees had a healthy and safe place to work.

She added: 'American Apparel failed to properly train its employees regarding safety procedures and failed to maintain a safe and healthy work environment.'  

The company released a statement following the agreement denying it had broken any laws concerning Mr Phan's death.  

The company founder Dov Charney, pictured, was sacked by the board 'for cause' after an unrelated incident 

A spokesperson said: 'In August 2011, an American Apparel knitting machine operator died in a tragic industrial accident. While the company does not believe it violated any laws regarding worker safety, it has entered into an agreement with the Orange County District Attorney’s Office to resolve civil citations issued by Cal-OSHA in a manner believed to be fair and that avoids the expense of protracted litigation. 

'American Apparel has been and continues to be absolutely committed to providing its employees with a safe work place and fair wages in a sweat-shop free environment.'

The company agreed to pay $283,000 towards administrative and investigation costs as well as a further $566,000 in civil penalties. 

American Apparel recently sacked its chairman Dov Charney 'for cause' following an investigation into misconduct. 

Alan Mayer of American Apparel said: 'We take no joy in this, but the Board felt it was the right thing to do.

'Dov Charney created American Apparel, but the Company has grown much larger than any one individual and we are confident that its greatest days are still ahead.'
