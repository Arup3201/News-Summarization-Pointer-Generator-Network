It was time for Malcolm Butler to take a(nother) victory lap on Tuesday.

Capping off an event-packed week following the New England Patriots' Super Bowl win, the cornerback took possession of his brand new truck.

The Chevy Colorado was given to him by quarterback Tom Brady, who won it after being named MVP of the game - and Chevy responded by giving Brady his own car, too.

'I am ecstatic that Chevrolet has chosen to reward me with a Colorado,' Butler said, according to TMZ.

'It is just another unreal event in what has been an incredible week.'

Butler is credited with turning a possible Patriots loss into a definite Patriots victory when he intercepted Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson on the one-yard-line with just 20 seconds left in the game.

The play was so big in fact, and so crucial to the Patriots victory, that many felt Butler would be taking home MVP honors for the evening.

In the end though, it went to the man who two interceptions that night, and two previous MVP trophies - Tom Brady.

Now both will be winners in their shiny new cars.

The Chevrolet Colorado retails for about $20,000. 

Many outside the organization are surprised by Butler's rise from virtually unknown to post-season legend, his teammates have been seeing this kind of work and smart play in practice all season.

'He’s been doing it to me in practice all season so it was nice to see him pick someone else off,' joked Brady.

This after Brady said as he received his MVP award; 'Malcolm made a huge play to save our season. It was the perfect play at the perfect time. None of us will ever forget that play.'

Brady decided to regift the free Chevrolet Colorado pickup he got - worth about $20,000

Vince Wilfork, the most respected member of the team's defense, echoed Brady's statement, saying; 'That is just one of those things that is so fitting for him just because of how he worked himself into playing time.' 

Butler's play was not just a win for the Patriots either, with his uplifting story and remarkable play providing the NFL with one of the few positive stories to come out of the league during this scandal-plagued season and ending things on a very high not.

Brady added a few more records to his legacy on Sunday well as he now has the most Super Bowl appearances (six), the most Super Bowl victories alongside Terry Bradshaw and Joe Montana (four), and the most MVP trophies, again shared with Montana (three).
