A mother and son in Illinois had a very lucky escape when a giant sinkhole swallowed their car and were then run over by a truck.

Juanita Pineda, 41, and her son Benjamin Hernandez, 15, were on a paper route at around 3.50am just north of Chicago when their Ford Taurus fell into the 10ft-wide hole last Tuesday.

Benjamin suffered a fractured spine, nose and jaw and lost his front teeth, but their run of atrocious luck didn't end there.

Collapse: The road just outside of Chicago had collapsed to cause this 10-ft wide sinkhole to form and swallow a mother and son on an early morning paper route

Close call: Kane County crews look over a sinkhole in Burlington Township, Ill Tuesday, July 1, 2014, where three people escaped serious injury when two vehicles traveled into the sinkhole on a rural stretch of road

During her 911 call to emergency services, a pick-up truck that didn't see the hole or their car drove straight over them, but amazingly didn't add to their injuries.

While on the phone to the 911 dispatcher, Pineda can be heard wailing, 'Oh my God, no! Another car!'.

In audio released of the phone call, the pick-up truck driver can be heard running over to the sinkhole to offer help to the stricken mother and son.

He can be heard shouting to them, 'Did I just driver on top of you? Oh my God!'

Injuries: Benjamin Hernandez was in the back seat of the car and suffered the worst injuries

Lucky: Firefighters ladder's are still left where they were when they descended to help the mother and son caught up in the accident

Run over: This is the truck which motored over Juanita Pineda, 41, and her son Benjamin Hernandez, 15, after their crash in Illinois on Tuesday

'I wish it didn't happen to none of us,' Benjamin said from his hospital bed to NBC about the accident which left his mother's car completely below ground level.

Benjamin was in the back seat of the car when the accident happened - trapping him while his mother escaped with no injuries.

'We were very lucky that that person who flew over us, that he flew over, not on top of us,' Pineda said.

Benjamin told NBC that he blacked out during the accident.

Survivor: Benjamin, 15, suffered serious injuries in the accident while his mother, Juanita, (right) was relatively unscathed

'All I remember is packing and then listening to my mom screaming for me to wake up,' said the lucky teen.

Pineda said that she was terrified for her son's safety.

'All I remember him telling me is, 'Mom, I'm going to hold on for you, mom I'm going to hold on.' I said, 'Benjamin, please don't leave me, I'm here for you, I'm going to be strong for you,' Pineda said.

Hernandez is expect to be hospitalized for another week.
