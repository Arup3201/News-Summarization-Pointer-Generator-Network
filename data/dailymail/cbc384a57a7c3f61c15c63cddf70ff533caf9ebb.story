Taking legal action: Ectodermal dysplasia sufferer Jahmel Binion, 23 (pictured) is suing Shaquille O'Neal for ridiculing him online in April

A disabled man is suing former NBA great Shaquille O'Neal and two other celebrities for ridiculing his appearance in an online post.

Jahmel Binion, 23, claims he suffered emotional distress after O’Neal posted a picture on Instagram of his own contorted faced next to Binion's with the caption 'Smile Today'.

The April post gained more than 14,000 likes, with basketball player Trey Burke and rapper Waka Flocka Flame joining in on the teasing.

Following a public backlash, the post was deleted and Shaq and Burke apologized to Binion.

However, the Michigan man has filed a lawsuit in Macomb County alleging that O’Neal, Burke and Waka Flocka Flame intentionally inflicted emotional distress, invaded his privacy and defamed him, Macomb Daily reported.

In the lawsuit, Binion claims the mocking photos 'constituted a public disclosure of embarrassing private facts about the plaintiff' and 'placed plaintiff in a false light in the public eye.'

Binion was diagnosed with hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia as a baby, a disorder which causes sparse hair growth, missing teeth and facial deformities.

He said he struggles to hold down a job and can't work in hot conditions.

Binion said he was dumbfounded to see thousands of internet users 
mocked his picture when it appeared on Shaq's feed.

Binion told My Fox Detroit: 'I've been getting teased since I was yea tall - people laugh at me, stare at me.

'I
 was kinda hurt because I look up to him and I watch Shaq play 
basketball so I was like, why is he making fun of me when he's supposed 
to be this role model?'

'I can't let it get to me, then I get hurt and depressed, so I keep my mind positive.'

The National Foundation for Ectodermal Dysplasias wrote an open letter to O'Neal saying 'bullying is never acceptable', as many Instagram and Twitter users demanded Shaq apologize for the photo.

Days later, Shaq said he called Binion to say sorry.

'Made
 a new friend today when I called and apologized to Jahmel Binion. Great
 dude,' he tweeted with the hashtags #alwayslearning and #MYBADCUZ.

He followed up with another tweet that said: 'Had the opportunity to 
talk to Jahmel Binion yesterday and apologize about the post on IG!'

O'Neal
 spokesman Rishi Daulat told The Associated Press that 
the star personally wrote the tweets. Daulat declined further comment.

Instead of hiding away, Binion has used the publicity to
 start a campaign raising awareness of his condition.

A Facebook page for his Hug Don't Judge campaign has gained more than 22,000 fans and been flooded with photos by parents whose children have 
the same disorder.

The description reads: 'This page is to support my anti-bulling and cyber bullying organization'.

Visit the Facebook campaign at #hugdontjudge.

Dear Mr. O’Neal,

All of us at the National Foundation for Ectodermal Dysplasias (NFED) are terribly disappointed by the hurtful image that you and others recently posted on social media about a member of our family, Jahmel Binion, who is affected by ectodermal dysplasia.

Individuals affected by these rare, genetic conditions often face a lifetime of bullying and negative remarks because of their appearance, which others may consider “different.”  Bullying is never acceptable and we, as a nation, have had some devastating consequences as a result of bullying. However, to be called out on a celebrity’s social media and made fun of is especially reprehensible.  We applaud Jahmel for reacting to this cyberbullying by establishing a positive social media campaign called “Hug Don’t Judge.”

Mr. O’Neal, we welcome this opportunity to enlighten you about the ectodermal dysplasias and how we could work together for positive change.

The ectodermal dysplasias are rare genetic conditions that affect the development of hair, teeth, skin, glands and nails in men, women and children of all races and ethnic groups.  Of the more than 180 different syndromes, x-linked hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (XLHED) is the most common and features multiple malformed and missing teeth, the inability to perspire, sparse hair and recurring respiratory infections. Symptoms can range from mild to severe, but in all cases present a variety of challenges.

We invite you to attend our NFED National Family Conference, July 23-26 in Columbus, Ohio, and meet families from around the world who, like Jahmel, are affected by ectodermal dysplasias.  You will meet some extraordinary people who are accomplishing profound acts despite the harsh social stigmas, daunting physical challenges, and financially draining dental procedures they’re up against.

You might want to consider making something positive come from this.  Consider giving Jahmel Binion the gift of a smile, one that others would not make fun of.  Give him a smile that would give him confidence and pride.

We are urging our NFED community to use this opportunity to raise awareness, to make positive change, and to support Jahmel’s “Hug Don’t Judge” campaign (#hugdontjudge). We encourage you to do the same.  Let’s raise awareness of the ectodermal dysplasias. Together, we have the power to make life better for the people it affects.

Beauty is diverse. Let us show you.

Sincerely,

Mary FeteExecutive Director
