A renowned former ballet dancer and actress was fatally hit by two vehicles and dragged more than 600ft along the road after getting out of her car in an apparent attempt to help a wounded animal.

Zina Bethune, 66, whose married name is Zina Feeley, was driving near Griffith Park in Los Angeles, California, when she saw what she thought was a wounded animal.

She left her Lincoln Town Car running on Forest Lawn Drive early on Sunday morning and got out to help what turned out to be a dead possum, when she was hit by an eastbound vehicle.

Ms Bethune was then thrown into the 
opposite lane, where she was hit by another vehicle that dragged her 
body more than 600ft, police said. She had severe head injuries and died
 at the scene.

Police have not identified the car 
that was involved in the second collision. They believe the driver may 
have fled or may have been among the many drivers interviewed by 
investigators at the scene.

Ms Bethune trained under famed dance 
instructor George Balanchine and began dancing with the New York City 
Ballet at the age of 14, despite suffering from scoliosis and 
lymphedema.

'I was born to dance, in my heart, but
 not in my body,' she told the Los Angeles Times in 1999. Ms Bethune is 
survived by her husband Sean Feeley and her mother Ivy, the newspaper 
reported.
