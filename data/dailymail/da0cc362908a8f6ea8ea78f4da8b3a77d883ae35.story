Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur missed out on the opportunity to narrow the gap to Under 21 league leaders Manchester United after playing out a goalless draw at Wheatsheaf Park.

Spurs went into the game at Staines Town sitting sixth in the league but victory would have taken them joint top with the Red Devils, while the defending champions were only three points behind the north London outfit.

Both teams will rue missed chances to claim all three points, with Spurs looking more likely to break the deadlock in the second half following a first period dominated by Chelsea.

Ruben Loftus-Cheek played for Chelsea Under 21s having already starred in the Champions League this term

CHELSEA (4-3-3): Beeney, Dabo, Aina, Clarke-Salter, Dasilva, Colkett, Houghton, Loftus-Cheek (Boga 37), Brown, Solanke (Abraham 82), Mitchell (Musonda 67).

Subs not used: Collins, Palmer.

TOTTENHAM (4-3-3): McGee, Yedlin, McQueen, Amos, Lesniak, Carter-Vickers, McEvoy, Winks, Akindayini, Ceballos (Walker-Peters 69), Miller.

Subs not used: Loft, Ross, Miles.

Mitchell Beeney fumbled a low 20-yard attempt from Cristian Ceballos, but the Chelsea stopper was fortunate to see the ball roll through his legs and back off the post before gathering.

Chelsea could have scored a dramatic winner in injury time but Luke McGee made a superb double stop to deny an Izzy Brown header, before quickly recovering to stop Tammy Abraham from close range on the follow up.

The result saw Spurs climb to third behind United and Liverpool while the Blues remain eighth. 

Despite the lack of goals, Spurs Under 21 boss Ugo Ehiogu will be encouraged by his side's display with USA international DeAndre Yedlin impressing at right-back, especially in the second half with a lively attacking display.

The Blues started talented prospect Ruben Loftus-Cheek, but the midfielder was forced off injured after just 37 minutes with a knock.

DeAndre Yedlin is already a senior international for the United States and impressed at right-back for Spurs
