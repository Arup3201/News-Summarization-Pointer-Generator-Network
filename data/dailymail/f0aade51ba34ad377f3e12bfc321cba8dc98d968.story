The woman had taken her child from his father on a flight bound for Beijing out of Dulles International Airport in Washington, D.C.

The FBI contacted Flight 897 in mid-air and asked that it return to D.C. soon after its midday takeoff. The plane landed back at the airport around 5pm.

A United Airlines flight bound for Beijing from D.C. was turned around in mid-air on Thursday after a mother who was kidnapping her child was reported on board

The child was found on board the flight with his mother and grandmother.

The mother was taken into custody at the gate and the child reunited with the father, the FBI told MailOnline today. 

The family has not yet been identified but the alleged kidnapping occurred following a custody issue, a spokesman said.

The grandmother was not arrested. 

The woman is due to appear in federal court in Virginia on Friday afternoon where she faces charges of international parental kidnapping.

The United flight took off for a second time shortly before 8pm. 

In a statement today, United told MailOnline: 'We returned to Washington Dulles at the request of law enforcement.

'UA flight 897 from Dulles to Beijing originally departed on time at 12.20pm. After it returned to Dulles, we assigned a new crew due to crew legality limits, and then re-departed for Beijing at 7:47 pm ET.'
