From a drug-addled ordeal in Miami to a Playboy interview where he revealed he likes to watch football naked, it was only a question of time before John Bolaris' future as a weatherman was called into question.

And now it has been announced that Mr Bolaris, who presented weather 
forecasts at Philadelphia Fox affiliate WTXF for four years, has lost his job.

A Fox spokeswoman told the Philadelphia Daily News: 'We mutually agreed that it was time to part ways'.

Mr Bolaris' troubles started with a vacation to Miami Beach two years ago that turned into a story ripped right out of the Hangover films.

In March 2010, the four-time Emmy winner was at a bar schmoozing with fans when he was seduced by two Eastern European women.

He told the Daily News that he woke up the next morning in a taxi, unable to recall what had happened the night before.

When he confronted the women that day, they took him out again, and, for a second time, he woke up unable to remember what happened.

Mr Bolaris knew he had been drugged, but didnâ€™t realize the extent until days later, when his credit card company called him to report he had charged more than $43,000 on alcohol, expensive food and an absurd painting of a woman's head.

He later testified about the ordeal before a grand jury, which led to the arrest of 17 members of an Eastern European crime ring.

But the trouble was far from over, after he sat down with Playboy magazine for an interview about the 'Bar Girls' scam last year.

The veteran meteorologist also got into a tiff with management several months ago after they refused to let him interview his friend, disgraced baseball star Lenny Dykstra.

But it was the sit-down with the men's magazine that would seal his fate.

The interview presented Mr Bolaris as an out-of-town boozehound who followed the women because he was looking to 'get laid'.

He also mentioned to Playboy that one of his favourite pastimes was to 'watch football naked with my lady and a bottle of wine.'

He added: 'Then, the next morning, make breakfast for her, turkey Hot Pockets with egg whites in the microwave'.

His bosses at WTXF did not appreciate the extra information about himself, and though Mr Bolaris denied saying anything of the sort, he was suspended from the network last month.

He would never see the weather studio again.
