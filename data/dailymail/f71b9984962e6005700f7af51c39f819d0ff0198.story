From dangerous driving conditions to slimy clothes and a frizzy hair-do - nobody enjoys cycling in the rain.

But now intrepid cyclists can keep dry using an umbrella that has been specially designed to clip onto bikes.

A Dutch firm based in Delft has invented a simple clamp that fits a bike’s handlebars and holds a windproof umbrella firmly in place to protect a rider from wind and rain.

The holder can also be used to store the umbrella when the rain stops too.

The umbrella's asymmetric design is said to help it withstand high speed wind gusts of up to 70mph (113kph).

The aerodynamic design directs wind over and around the brolly, which holds its shape and keeps people dry underneath.

As an increasing number of people cycle in cities, new bikes and add-ons have been developed to make life easier.

Last week, a new bike was unveiled that has handlebars that can be used as a bike lock.

The Denny bike  lots of safety features, an automatic gear shifter, built-in lights and a motor to help cyclists up hills.

A London-based company named Blaze showcased a safety feature called Laserlight, which projects an icon onto the road, helping to ensure that drivers are aware of an approaching cyclist, even if they cannot see them.

A green image of a bike is beamed between 16 and 19ft (five and six metres) in front of a cyclist, signalling that a driver should not turn across their path.

While its makers, Senz, cautions against riding in high winds, the umbrella design lends itself to coping with the air stream created by cycling.

A spokesperson for the Dutch firm said: ‘Ruining your hairdo, ending up with dripping clothes after a quick ride to the shops will be a thing of the past with the Senz umbrella holder.

‘The clamp allows you to attach your umbrella on your bike, while keeping both hands on the handle bars and giving a good sight of traffic.

‘When it is not raining the holder is easily folded back and the brolly attached to the bike forks.’

The clamp costs €39 (£31) while the umbrellas come in different sizes and are sold separately for €25 (£20) and €50 (£40).

The aerodynamic and wind-resistant umbrella was invented by engineering student Gerwin Hoogendoorn after storms broke three of his standard umbrellas in a week.

No more wet clothes for £30: ‘The clamp allows you to attach your umbrella on your bike, while keeping both hands on the handle bars and giving a good sight of traffic,' the firm said. The clamp (pictured) costs €39 (£31) and is sold separately to the umbrella
