Ejected from a glass tube with great force, four shrimps fly through the air at breakneck speed, heading towards a drenching of flour, eggs and breadcrumbs before whizzing towards a flamethrower, where they are flash-grilled to perfection.

The crazy cooking technique was developed by the Japanese, and according to the directions in the video, a plate of lightly battered shrimp is ready to eat in just three seconds. 

The Japanese-narrated video showcases a host of gadgets including air cannons, CO2 tanks and flame throwers.  

The shrimp have been stuffed into glass air cannons, which shoot the crustaceans out at great speed

The action takes place in a matter of seconds as the shrimp fly towards flour and breadcrumb eruptions

The film starts with two ladies displaying the ingredients needed to create the battered shrimp dish.

They both don safety goggles before a step-by-step explanation of the devices involved begins.

First, beaten eggs are poured into what seems to be a large silver canteen. 

Then we see four inverted triangular containers which are filled with flour.

The camera then moves to the glass air cannon, which the shrimp have been stuffed into.

A push of a button activates the individual devices in the four-step process and flames – which will quickly cook the shrimp - shoot out of the fourth apparatus.

It’s a blink and you’ll miss it moment as the action takes place in a matter of seconds.

The flames from the fourth device flash fry the shrimps to perfection 

In the slowed down version, the entire process is made clear to the viewers. 

The video, which at this juncture is accompanied by a heavy metal soundtrack, takes on a surreal tone.

Accompanied by guitar riffs and loud drumbeats, the shrimp shoot out of their respective glass cases, streaking towards a flour shower. 

They then whizz towards a cascade of eggs before being drenched in breadcrumbs.

A ball of flames erupting from the fourth gadget swiftly cooks them before the cooked crustaceans land on a plate. 

The hosts of the show then dig into the meal, which, according to the video, contains 502 calories.
