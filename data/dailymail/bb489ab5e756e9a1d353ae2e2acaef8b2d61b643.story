John Simpson prides himself on controlling his emotions when he reports on the heartbreak of those caught up in the midst of war.

But the veteran reporter had to fight back the tears as he recalled the day he ‘rejected’ his own mother – when he was just seven-years-old.

Simpson, who had to choose which of his estranged parents to live with, revealed that his decision to stay with his father Roy caused a permanent and terrible rift between him and his late mother Joyce.

Speaking exclusively to The Mail on Sunday, he said: ‘There was just this awful thing between us. There was my guilt at having rejected my mother and my mother’s guilt at having kind of left me. I did love her and she was a lovely woman, but there was this barrier which neither of us could break down.’

Simpson, now 69, reveals he then saw his mother only a handful of times – ‘perhaps half a dozen or more’ – before her death in 1983.

The father-of-three’s family story is told in an emotionally charged edition of the TV programme Who Do You Think You Are? later this month.

Viewers will see Simpson recall the moment he made his fateful decision.

He says: ‘My mother left my father when I was seven. And what I remember was standing on the doorstep with the two of them and with my mother already packed and prepared to go and to take me with her.

‘And my father standing there and saying, ‘‘Don’t you think we ought to ask the boy who he wants to go with?’’ And so I thought about it and for  better or worse I chose my father.’

Simpson says the split divided the family and effectively cut him off from his mother and her relatives.In a particularly poignant scene, he struggles to contain himself when he is shown photographs of his mother he has never seen before.

He says: ‘Just seeing these pictures of my mother – very, very moving.’

Simpson said last night he had been determined not to cry on camera but the subject matter had proved too  difficult. He said: ‘I know there is a comedian who jokes that the programme is just middle-class people crying in libraries.

‘My wife had said to me, ‘‘Whatever you do, don’t cry,’’ but I do become emotional about my mother.’

The programme will be screened on BBC1 on September 25 at 9pm.
