Glorious blue skies, sizzling sunshine and summer temperatures have put March on course to be third warmest since records began.

Official provisional figures also show it was one of the driest, with 38 per cent of the normal rainfall for the time of year, the Met Office said last night.

However, with clouds and cooler temperatures due to roll over Britain this weekend, forecasters say most people have just another day to make the most of the unseasonal early spring.

Next week is expected to stay cooler with the chance of rain or even snow on hills in the North and Scotland.

According to official records up to March 28, the average temperature for the month across the UK was 7.6c (45.7f).

Since records began in 1910, only 1938 and 1957 have enjoyed warmer Marches. Rainfall was below normal for most of the UK, increasing the risk that the drought in the South, East and Yorkshire could spread in the next few months.

The UK got an average of 36mm (1.4in) over the month. England was the driest part of the country with just 26.3mm (1in) or 39 per cent of its March average, while Wales got 32mm (1.3in) or 27 per cent of its normal rainfall for the time of year.

Scotland had 55.7mm (2.2in) or 40 per cent of its normal March rainfall.

After two dry winters - and without good early spring rainfalls to top up underground aquifers and reservoirs - groundwater levels are low.

Seven water companies in the South and South-East are imposing hosepipe bans next week.

Dan Williams of the Met Office said this March ‘looks like being the fifth driest on record, with only 1953, 1944, 1931 and 1921 in front’.

The month was also far sunnier than normal, with England getting 152 hours of sunshine – around 50 hours more than average for the time of year.

Today will start cloudy in the west with a risk of drizzle, but most places will enjoy another day of sunshine and warmth.

However, tomorrow sees the arrival of cooler weather with some light rain or drizzle possible over the weekend, particularly in the North-West.

The South and Midlands are likely to get the best weekend weather.

The unseasonal weather has been playing games with nature, with cats breeding earlier in the season than usual - causng issues at cat rehoming centres - and even leading to the first crop of British tomatoes arriving a whole month early.

The unseasonable hot spell has ripened 100 tonnes of tomatoes which are not ordinarily picked until the end of April - but today, the first crop was handpicked.

Thousands of the tomatoes, which include piccolo and beefsteak varieties, have ripened rapidly this spring on the Isle of Wight. They are now being harvested at Wight Salads, nestled in the Arreton Valley, which is the single biggest tomato grower in the UK.

The island supplies more than 8 million tonnes of tomatoes to UK supermarkets every year. The Romans first grew tomatoes on the Isle of Wight because of its favourable climate to ensure a reliable supply throughout their reign.

The island now grows more than 40 varieties.

Experts at Wight Salads say the abundance of sunshine and warmth allows tomatoes to be grown for longer on the vine.

This means greater sugar production which they claim makes them 'Britain’s sweetest and tastiest tomatoes, bursting with vitamins and minerals'.

Brian Moralee, growing manager at Wight Salads Group, said: 'We are thrilled with this early burst of warm, sunny weather.

'Here on the island we feel good weather more, which brings out the best in our tomatoes’ taste and quality.

'We will pick 100 tonnes this week, destined for UK supermarkets.'

Isle of Wight Tomatoes are sold in stores such as M&S, Sainsbury’s and Waitrose.

Train drivers are being forced to slow down over fears the recent sunshine could cause tracks to overheat.

Network Rail has imposed a 20mph 
speed restrictions across a stretch of line in the West Country because 
of the effect the heatwave could have on the tracks.

The curb on speed - called heat speeds - has been imposed between Bathampton Junction and Sydney Garden near Bath.

Network Rail say the heat speed is a precautionary measure following weekend work.

It blamed the restriction on the lower-than-normal heat tolerance of a new section of track.

A spokesperson for Network Rail said:
'We have over the weekend renewed that small section of track and 
therefore its heat tolerance level is lower than the norm.

'Speed restriction is proactively 
imposed where necessary so that we lower the chances of track failure 
and avoid having to cancel trains altogether.'

Still, those who were not commuting 
or trapped in an office were finding reasons to get outside - such as 
Amy Hill and Jennifer Riley, both 23 years old from Forest Hill, London,
who enjoyed the heat in St James's Park London yesterday afternoon.

But
make the most of it while you can - for while many have been soaking up
the sun on beaches and parks around the country, as usual the clouds 
will roll in just in time for the weekend to provide us with a more 
traditional start to April.
