Christian Benteke admitted he 'can't wait' to play for Aston Villa again after his seven-month injury lay-off.

The 23-year-old ruptured his Achilles during training in April, forcing him to miss the remainder of the Premier League season and the World Cup in Brazil.

But now the Belgian star is on the verge of making a return, and could even feature against Manchester City on Saturday.

Benteke ruptured his Achilles during training and missed the next seven months of football

Speaking to The Sun, Benteke said: 'I promised Villa fans I would work hard to get back as soon as my body allowed - and I have. But now I can't wait.'

The former Genk forward admitted it was tough missing so much football, but was grateful for his manager's support throughout the ordeal.

He said: 'He (Paul Lambert) told me he had suffered a long injury once when he was a player and was out for three months, so he knew what I was going through. Working alone is too difficult in those circumstances. To work as hard as I wanted to I had to be with friends and family.

'He let me live in Belgium for three months and I just lived a normal life.' 

The Belgian forward has played for the Under 21 side and could soon make his competitive return
