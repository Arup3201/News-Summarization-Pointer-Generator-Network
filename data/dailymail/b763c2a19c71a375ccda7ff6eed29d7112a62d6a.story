Manchester United striker James Wilson believes he can continue to grow at Old Trafford after enjoying a memorable debut against Hull on Tuesday evening.

The 18-year-old scored twice as Ryan Giggs' side secured a comfortable win in their last home game of the season.

Wilson, who is a product of the club's academy, is confident that he can deal with the pressure of performing in the Premier League.

Speaking to the Daily Star, Wilson said: 'I feel like I can deal with the physicality and pace of the game. I just need to get as many games as possible under my belt for the experience.

'If you're getting on in the club, you have to be progressing so obviously scoring for every age group is a good sign. I've got to where I am now but I need to kick on.'

Wilson has played at Old Trafford for United's youth teams, but Tuesday night's game against Steve Bruce's side provided him with his biggest audience yet.

After netting a brace against the Tigers, Wilson said: 'It was a great feeling and you can't compare it to anything else. The first goal was just sheer euphoria and then the second was a great experience.

'The ground is a lot different without 75,000 people, but just to play here even in front of a small crowd for the Under-21s is still a great experience. With all the fans here against Hull it was even better.'
