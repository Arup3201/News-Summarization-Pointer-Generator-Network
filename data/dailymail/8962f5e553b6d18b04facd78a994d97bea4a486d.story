They say with age comes wisdom, but who knew you'd also end up with hair sprouting in unexpected places, unsightly knobbles and bobbles, and a complexion the frighteningly hideous movie character Nanny McPhee would be proud of. But help is at hand.

The latest cosmetic 'tweakments' – minor procedures, with little downtime – are simple yet effective ways to combat the signs of ageing.

Here we round up the best of them, showcased at the Clinical Cosmetic and Reconstructive Expo in London last month.

Rather than creating unrealistic bodies, the treatments – most of which are approved by the US Food And Drug Administration (FDA) – correct minor flaws, so you look like you, but better.

Peel away age spots 

The iS Clinical Fire & Ice no-peel skin peel is reportedly Gwyneth Paltrow's go-to treatment for gleaming skin. The FDA-approved treatment helps pump oxygen to the skin for a brighter appearance.

HOW DOES IT WORK?

A mixture of glycolic acid and retinol are applied as a mask to strip away the loose top layers of the skin, reducing blemishes, pigmentation and fine lines and encouraging cellular renewal. 

This boosts the production of collagen, which gives skin its structure.

IS IT SAFE?

If you have sensitive skin, you may see reddening at first. Most people don't need recovery time and can have a peel every four to six weeks.

WHERE CAN I GET IT?

At clinics nationwide from £75 – isclinical.co.uk.

Zap thread veins 

Thread veins on the face can leave your skin looking blotchy. The Viridex thermocoagulation treatment uses radiowaves to eliminate broken capillaries, leaving a clear 'peaches and cream' glow.

HOW DOES IT WORK?

A fine needle depresses the skin at regular intervals. Radio waves heat the hand-held needle, which is inserted into the capillary and makes it collapse. The blood moves into other tissue and is reabsorbed.

IS IT SAFE?

The technology has been developed by scientists over 15 years. There may be some sensitivity but treatment does not require an anaesthetic.

WHERE CAN I GET IT?

From about £100 per treatment at jemma-upton. co.uk.

Plump up thinning lips

Juvederm Ultra 3 and Volbella are dermal fillers that have a lower viscosity than those used for deep lines or cheek-plumping in older patients.

This makes them ideal for use in the lip, giving a naturally soft, kissable feel that ought to detract from a Nanny McPhee snaggle tooth.

HOW DOES IT WORK?

The main ingredient is hyaluronic acid, which exists naturally in our skin but is lost as we age. Injected beneath the skin around the lip with a very fine needle, it can smooth out fine lines and add volume.

IS IT SAFE?

Juvederm has full FDA approval. Volbella doesn't yet, but trials have been carried out on more than 120 patients over two studies and there are three ongoing clinical studies. In one recent study of 62 patients, half reported a small amount of swelling 15 minutes after the injection, but no other adverse affects were noted.

WHERE CAN I GET IT?

Costs from £300 – see allergan.co.uk or Juvederm.co.uk.

Beat that monobrow 

Exilite, a high-tech intense pulsed light (IPL) treatment, is one of the fastest and most effective depilation methods on the market. There's no wax or lasers and it's safe on delicate areas such as the face, underarms and bikini line.

HOW DOES IT WORK?

The device emits pulses of bright light, which is absorbed and converted into heat in the hair follicles, destroying those in the active phase of growth. Multiple treatments are required.

IS IT SAFE?

In a study, men and women were given six sessions with a seven-week break between each and achieved an average hair reduction of 69 per cent. It is FDA-approved and proven to be safe, although it's not suitable for people with fair hair as the light is attracted to dark pigmentation only.

WHERE CAN I GET IT?

From about £50 per session, per area – btlaesthetics.com.

Freeze off warts and skin tags 

CryoPen is a nifty hand-held device that delivers a micro-fine jet of cryogen (freezing solution) to blast away warts, skin tags and any other unsightly skin protuberances in seconds – and for good.

HOW DOES IT WORK? 

Cryotherapy (or cold therapy) is well established and has been used for the treatment of everything from some cancers to sports injuries. The CryoPen puts this method to cosmetic use, with a base unit cooling it to -90C. When the pen is touched to the offending skin blemish, it rapidly cools the skin tissue. When the skin cells reach -20C, the cells are killed and the blemish eradicated in between five and 90 seconds.

IS IT SAFE?

There may be some tingling, similar to a nettle sting, while the procedure takes place. In some cases a blister may form in the initial 24 hours after treatment. This then scabs over and heals in two to six weeks. Melanomas or lesions suspected of being melanomas should not be treated. It is FDA-cleared.

WHERE CAN I GET IT?

From about £40 to £80 per session – cryosthetics.co.uk.
