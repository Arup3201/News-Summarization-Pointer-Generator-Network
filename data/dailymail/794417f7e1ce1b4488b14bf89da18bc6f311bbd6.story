This futuristic 'eco' treehouse is being booked up fast by romantic couples looking to get back to nature and discover their inner Tarzan and Jane.

The cutting edge retreat, which offers a romantic bolthole amongst the treetops, is proving a run away success for farmers George and Julie Nicolson.

The treehouse was designed as a cosy hideaway for two, nestling in its very own bluebell wood and surrounded by native broadleaved trees and the odd red squirrel.

Perched atop 11 legs made of larch wood, the treehouse sits in woodland at a cattle farm in Brochloch in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland

The built-in double bed also has a skylight so guests can gaze at the stars as they drift off to sleep surrounded by the rolling countryside

There are suitable touches around the treehouse that it's the perfect spot for couple, not least the intimacy of the dining table

More than fifty tiny windows replicate dappled sunlight to enhance the treetop environment, and despite being completely 'off grid' it still provides a gas hob, small fridge, composting toilet and walls insulated with wool to keep it warm.

The built-in double bed also has a skylight so guests can gaze at the stars as they drift off to sleep surrounded by the rolling countryside and abundant wildlife.

And despite the emphasis being on getting back to nature the treehouse has the luxuries of a full-size bath and a log burner.

Perched atop eleven legs made of larch wood, the treehouse sits in woodland at Julie and George's 190-acre sheep and cattle farm in Brochloch in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland.

Although it was only made available to rent at the start of January, bookings are pouring in from couples looking to escape to the country for adventure and romance.

A two-night stay costs £300 and can be booked through Bristol-based get-away specialists Canopy and Stars. 

While the bathroom might be a tight squeeze, the close feel of the whole place means you can enjoy peace and quiet with your partner

The morning views are something to be treasured - whether it's a crisp winter's morning or a beautiful and sunny summer's day

Julie said: 'We wanted to diversify at the farm to boost our lowly income from the sheep and cattle so about three years ago we asked Sam Booth, an architect, to design us a little off-grid bothy that we could rent out.

'As soon as we launched it it just took off so last year we challenged Sam to design another to sit in our bluebell wood, and he came up with the idea of a treehouse.

'It's far enough away from the bothy that it feels totally secluded. It's an ideal place for a romantic getaway, not to mention a digital detox.

'The treehouse is completely off grid but that doesn't mean you can't live comfortably - it's got luxuries like a wood burner, a double bed and even a bath.

'We only started taking bookings at the start of the year and already the treehouse is proving very popular.'

Architect Sam added: 'We had previously designed another eco home for Julie and George so when they came to us asking for something a bit different we took up the challenge.

'The land they wanted it built on was in woodland so we thought why not build a treehouse.

'We drew a few scribbles of how we thought it should look - and the finished treehouse is remarkably close to those rough drawings.

'It's a celebration of nature. It's so much more than just a place to stay - it's an experience.'
