A 22-year-old Boston woman rescued her father today by lifting a car off his leg after the SUV he was working on in the driveway of their Plymouth home fell on him.

Adam Simmons was working on his daughter's Jeep Liberty's brakes today when the jacks holding the car aloft gave way and one of the car's wheel rotors landed on his leg. 

His daughter, Rachael Simmons, heard his yells of pain from inside the house and ran to help. When she saw that the car, which according to MotorTrend.com weighs 5,600 pounds, was crushing her father's leg, she lifted it up so he could get free.

'I ran out of the house and I saw him under my car,' she told CBS. 

Her father pleaded with her to do something to help him.

'I just lifted so he could get free. It was just the adrenaline rushing right through my body. I don’t know if I would have been able to do it otherwise,' she said.

Paramedics were called and Adam Simmons was taken to the hospital where he was found to have only cuts and bruises. Doctors told Simmons that if he'd remained under the car any longer, his injuries could have been very serious.
