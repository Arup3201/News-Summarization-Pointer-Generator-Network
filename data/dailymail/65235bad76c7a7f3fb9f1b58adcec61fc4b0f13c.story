Casey Anthony has agreed to pay $25,000 to her bankruptcy estate to avoid having to write her life story.

A judge in her bankruptcy case approved the agreement between Anthony and her bankruptcy trustee in papers made public Wednesday.

The trustee had considered the possibility of selling Anthony's life story to help pay off her debts to creditors. Anthony had opposed the idea.

Anthony was acquitted two years ago of murdering her 2-year-old daughter, Caylee. A jury believed Anthony’s version of 
events that Caylee had accidentally drowned and she had panicked and 
buried the girl.

Papers
filed in bankruptcy court say the compromise was reached to avoid 
protracted litigation over whether the trustee could legally force 
Anthony to write her memoirs.

News of the compromise comes a month after Anthony claimed a small victory in which a bankruptcy judge granted in part her request to dismiss a lawsuit against.

The lawsuit was filed by a volunteer group that spent thousands of dollars looking for her 
daughter.

In documents
provided by the court, Texas EquuSearch stated that the 27-year-old 
enlisted the organization’s help in the search for Caylee even 
though she knew at the time the two-year-old girl was dead.

EquuSearch founder Tim Miller said
his search and rescue organisation racked up bills of $119,000 to send 
volunteers to Orlando, Florida, to help in the search for Anthony's 
missing daughter Caylee.

A total of 4,200 volunteers descended on Orlando in the summer of 2008 to help scour woodland and swamp areas for the missing two-year-old after Anthony finally reported her missing.

The toddler's badly decomposed body was eventually found in December 2008 leading to a first degree murder charge.

EquuSearch was in the process of suing Anthony when she filed for bankruptcy earlier this year.

Judge K. Rodney May partially granted Anthony’s motion to dismiss, giving Texas EquuSearch 21 days to amend its complaint against Anthony, reported NBC News.

In June her lawyers said she could be at risk of 'disappearing' if the defamation cases against her continue.

The 27-year-old from Florida has been accused of slandering two people by implicating them in the death of her daughter.

But she is seeking to have their lawsuits dropped, claiming she does not have enough money to pay damages.

Anthony is being sued by Roy Kronk, the workman who found Caylee's body after the two-year-old had been missing for six months, who says he has been accused of wrongdoing over the toddler's death.

She also faces a suit from Zenaida Gonzalez, a woman with the same name as a fictional nanny who Anthony originally claimed had kidnapped Caylee.

However, both cases were paused in January when Anthony filed for bankruptcy.

Her lawyers are now seeking to have the suits dismissed, filing papers in Orange County Circuit Court claiming that Anthony could go into hiding as a result of her legal struggles, according to the Orlando Sentinel.

'She will either defend the cases or be forced to default because she has no money,' they wrote. 'She will be lampooned in the press. The death threats will again increase.

'She will be forced to find new accommodations, or just simply disappear and say it is not worth the fight anymore.'

Anthony, who was widely vilified at the time of her trial for murder, has barely been seen in public since being acquitted of killing her daughter.

She claims to be nearly $800,000 in debt thanks to heavy legal fees, and a bankruptcy trustee has sought to sell off the rights to her life story in order to pay her bills.

Although Anthony was found not guilty of murder in 2011, she was convicted of lying to police after it emerged that she had made up her explanation of why Caylee was missing.
