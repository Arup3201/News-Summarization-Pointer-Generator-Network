There were growing fears last night that the Somerset Levels could face another round of severe flooding.

As storms and winds of up to 93mph battered the west of England, rising water levels left locals dreading a repeat of last winter’s floods.

Somerset’s groundwater levels are now the second-highest for November since records began 45 years ago, according to the British Geological Survey (BGS) – after peaking in the last round of floods.

A familiar sight: The River Parrett in Bridgewater, Somerset, looks dangerously close to breaching its banks less than a year after it flooded

Rising water: The same stretch of river back in February at the height of the worst floods in living memory at the River Parrett in Somerset

Close to bursting: The river is currently at a high level in Burrowbridge and residents are on high alert as it looks close to spilling its banks

A year on: The River Parrett (pictured on January 30, 2014) has since been dredged as part of a £6million project hoped to help the village

Photos of the River Parrett near Bridgwater showed it looking dangerously close to spilling its banks, despite having just been dredged as part of a £6million project.

And trains were drenched as gaps appeared in the new sea wall in Dawlish, Devon, where the railway line had to be repaired at a cost of £35million after it washed into the sea in February.

The rising water is an all-too-familiar sight for the residents watching nervously from their homes, less than a year after the Levels were hit by the worst flooding in living memory.

Hundreds of people were forced to flee their homes as water covered huge swathes of the area, cutting off roads, leaving villages stranded and making large areas of farmland unusable.

Grim: A woman makes her way across the seafront at Torquay in Devon yesterday as the south west was lashed by 60mph gales

Echo: Trains were once again lashed by the waves yesterday in Dawlish, Devon, on the stretch of track which slid into the sea in February

Tough job: The railway line reopened with strengthened concrete foundations in April after a £35million rebuilding job which took two months

Foam: A woman braves (or simply tries to ignore) the elements to walk her dog in Dawlish, near where gaps appeared in the sea wall

Whipped up: Dawlish is once again the centre of attention, barely six months after the railway line (right) was rebuilt by a team of 300 workers

Careful: An amber weather warning for strong winds was in place from 9.30am to 2pm across parts of south west England and west Wales

A group of youths narrowly avoid a soaking at Brighton beach yesterday where strong gusts of wind brought waves crashing over the seafront

Cloudy skies over Brighton which is expected to experience heavy rain throughout tomorrow morning with clearer conditions in the afternoon

Heavy showers are expected across Brighton for the rest of the evening with temperatures expected to remain at around 10C. Water crashed over the seafront this afternoon threatening scores of day-trippers with an afternoon soaking 

Choppy water in Brighton this afternoon where waves rose over the seafront walls to shower tourists and residents braving the wet weather

Some homes were so badly damaged that 11 months on, their owners have still not been able to move back in. 

Andrew McKenzie, of the BGS, warned: ‘The well at Winsham, Somerset, an indicator for groundwater across Somerset and Dorset, is at record levels for the time of year. If we had a very wet winter, that would set the scene for extensive flooding.’

But despite their predicament, a few locals played down the scare and said it was nothing unusual for this time of year. 

Grim: The winds were due to peak at lunchtime yesterday - but would give way to heavy rain overnight and into tomorrow in the south west

Watch out! The Torquay seafront was particularly badly hit, with waves crashing over the sea wall onto the dual carriageway

Disruption: The Met Office warned of potential traffic problems including at Torquay, pictured. One gust off the Devon coast reached 93mph

Brave: A swimmer defies the wind and rain to jump into the Channel at Southsea, Portsmouth. Despite the gales, temperatures are normal

Spray: Wind whips up the spray in Dawlish, Devon, one of the areas in the south west battered by gales amid an amber weather warning

A cyclist braved strong winds and sheeting rain in Southsea near Portsmouth this afternoon to ride along the water-sprayed seafront 

Dog walkers were showered on the Portsmouth coast this afternoon with storms battering parts of the country with wet and windy conditions 

Winds reached 60mph in some parts of the country as a succession of Atlantic storms saw sea water crashing over barriers along the coast

The seafront in Southsea was scarce with walkers yesterday with only a few residents braving the wet conditions to walk along the beach

Waves washed over the seafront in Portsmouth as well as in other parts of the coast with more heavy rain expected over the weekend 

The Met Office has advised there will be persistent rain and wind across the south east tomorrow morning though skies are expected to clear by the afternoon. Strong winds blew sea water over the promenade in Southsea yesterday (pictured)

Lurching: The strong winds and rain, pictured in Portsmouth, Hampshire, have renewed fears about flooding among some residents

Bad time for a walk: The stormy weather arrived from the Atlantic this morning in dramatic fashion on the harbour wall at Porthleven, Cornwall

Jogging on: Thankfully for these runners in Southsea, the gusts were due to start dying down in the afternoon - to be replaced with rain

Crumbling: The stormy weather left its damage on these harbour steps at Polperro, Cornwall - though far from the damage wreaked last winter

Jenny Winslade from Bridgwater, who was forced to evacuate her home last winter, said: ‘We are designed to take a bit of water. The key thing is how fast they get rid of it and now we have super-duper wide dredged rivers there is plenty of room for water.’

And Gav Sadler from Moorland in Somerset, who also had to flee his home, wrote on Facebook: ‘The water’s in the river, that’s where it’s meant to be!’

South Somerset District Council held a meeting this week to talk through measures to keep roads in use, rescue operations and community flood plans. 

Optimistic: A windsurfer makes the most of the wind in Portmarnock, Dublin. Further north, Northern Ireland will be the worst-hit by rain

Water sports: Enthusiasts were out in force off the Irish coast as the sea took on a depressingly familiar shade of winter gloom

Gone swimming: A man leaves the sea complete with a swimming cap after going for a dip despite the gales in Portmarnock, Dublin

Flood: Waterlogged fields yesterday around the village of Clyst St Mary, Devon. The village suffered badly in the heavy storms last winter

Councillor Ric Pallister, leader of South Somerset District Council, said: ‘A lot has happened since the disastrous events of last winter and much work is still going on.

‘This meeting is an opportunity for the wider community to understand what has changed, what flood prevention measures have been put in place and what will now be different should we experience similar conditions across South Somerset in the future.’
