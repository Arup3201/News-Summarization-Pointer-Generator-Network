Jose Mourinho reckons England were unlucky to be grouped with Italy, Uruguay and Costa Rica, and the Chelsea manager says: 'I don't think they should be ashamed of this situation'.

England's World Cup was left in tatters after Roy Hodgson's men lost their second game 2-1 to Uruguay, having lost by the same scoreline against Italy five days before.

But Mourinho isn't so quick to judge, saying he doesn't think England had 'the football Gods on their side'.

'I
 think the Gods of football, if you can use that expression, were never 
with England since the draw until now, until even the Italy match 
against Costa Rica, where I don't think many people would think Italy 
could lose and Italy lost,' said Mourinho, a globalambassador for Yahoo.

'I
 don't think England was a happy team, they didn't have the football 
Gods on their side. They had two good matches, with good individual 
performances.

'I don't 
feel comfortable to criticise England or England's options because I 
don't think they should be ashamed of this situation.'

And Mourinho thinks England were 'not lucky in the draw' either.

'For some reason it is possible that you have three world champions and three strong teams like Uruguay, Italy and England in the same group,' he added.

'From the best three or four matches in this competition, England was present in two. It means that England did well, played well, competed well.

'They started both matches very well, was not afraid of Uruguay, was not afraid of Italy - conceded, reacted, scored an equaliser.

'When they equalised with 10 or 15 minutes to go, lots of people for sure thought England could win this match, but they lost.'
