Parents have accused an inner-city headteacher of turning a blind eye towards violent gangs of Roma pupils for fear of being labelled a racist.

More than 1,600 people have signed an online petition claiming ‘children have been stabbed, mugged and nearly kicked to death’ at the school.

It urges the head not to ‘be afraid’ to tackle the issue – and suggests he is failing to do so for fear of appearing racist because the majority of the perpetrators are of Slovakian Roma origin.

Attack: Three boys believed to be of Roma Slovak descent have been expelled from a Sheffield school after an attack on Rhys Larkin, left and right, who needed hospital treatment

Defence: Hinde House School says it has dealt with the incident swiftly and takes safety of students seriously

Referring to the child-abuse scandal involving Asian taxi drivers in Rotherham, the petition says: ‘We have all seen what happens when those in authority turn a blind eye for fear of being labelled racist from what has been happening in Rotherham and throughout the country.

'It is not good enough to pretend that the school is running smoothly when our children are coming home in fear having being intimidated by gangs or indeed having been assaulted. 

‘Children have been stabbed, mugged and nearly kicked to death in his school in which he claims everything is ok and we have had enough.’

Parents passed the petition to Mr French through the bars of the school gate today, and were due to meet with him this afternoon, but said the group meeting had been cancelled.  

The petition was launched after an attack last Thursday that left pupil Rhys Larkings, 14, battered and bruised with a broken nose after being allegedly punched to the ground by three Roma Slovak teenagers.

Police have arrested two 15-year-old boys on suspicion of assault and public order offences, and the pair have been bailed pending further inquiries.

Officers are still looking for a third boy, who has yet to be questioned. 

Rhys's mother Lorraine Larkings, 46, said parents are now being invited to smaller meetings for each year group, saying the school had wanted to 'avoid trouble' by having 'too many people' turn up at once.

Angry parents claim the head of Hinde House School in Sheffield has shown too much tolerance towards the Roma group blamed for a ‘gang-like culture’.

Response: Rhys' mother Lorraine has launched a petition now signed by 1,500 demanding his school tackle tensions she blames on Slovakian pupils

There are around 1,200 children aged three to 16 at the school and up to 200 from the large local Roma Slovak community. More than 38 per cent of pupils do not have English as a first language.

Rhys said he was beaten after being falsely accused of kicking a ball at a Slovakian child.

His mother Lorraine Larkings, 46, said: ‘I’m upset and disgusted. You send your children to school to be educated not to be assaulted.

‘Something needs to be done about this and quickly.’

Parents were due to stage a protest march after the meetings earlier today.

Mrs Larkings said she had been 'absolutely thrilled' by the support she received from other parents following the attack on her son.

'People are telling me they are not prepared to allow their children to be attacked and abused in this way,' she said.

'The hope is that if a decision is made to permanently exclude the offenders then things may calm down. But at the moment feelings are running high.' 

She added that Rhys had to be taken to hospital after the attack to have stitches, and said he is currently recovering from a broken nose and cuts to his ear and eyes at home.

Mrs Larkings said she would be keeping Rhys at home until the problem had been resolved. 

A boy of 13 also suffered a serious assault at the school in September last year.

The teenager walked away from a ‘minor altercation’ with a Roma boy, only to be ‘pushed down a flight of stairs and assaulted’ by three pupils moments later.

His 46-year-old mother, who wants to remain anonymous for fear of retribution, said he suffered a swollen eye and was badly shaken.

The three boys responsible were said to have remained at the school after being given a caution by police.

The mother said she was not racist but simply concerned about the safety of the school. ‘There have always been many different ethnic minorities at the school but we have never had anything like this before,’ she said.

Tension: Last year MP David Blunkett said his Sheffield constituents were 'on the edge of an explosion of feeling' because of tension with the Roma community in the city, pictured here after a street brawl

‘There is real anger. Parents have decided enough is enough. The school has been playing the problem right down.’

Two weeks ago a 13-year-old pupil was left with cuts and bruises after being ‘tripped and punched’ outside the school by two Roma Slovak youths who were not pupils.

The main attacker was quickly identified, but police told the victim’s family he’d returned to Slovakia so no action would be taken.

His mother said: ‘I feel on edge sending my son to school. If pupils are being attacked at school it’s scary.’

Headteacher Chris French said: ‘Tensions between a small number of children in year ten have been apparent at school for a couple of weeks but staff have been working with students, staff and the wider community to resolve these.’

He added in a letter to parents: 'This was clearly a serious incident, but was dealt with swiftly and school returned to calm quickly. We are currently investigating this seriously so that we can take appropriate action including permanent exclusions if necessary.

'Tension between small numbers of children in Year 10 has been apparent for the last few weeks. Staff had been dealing with this day to day.

'We always take the safety and welfare of our pupils extremely seriously and note that incidents such as this are extremely rare.'
