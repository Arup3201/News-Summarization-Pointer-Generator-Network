Liverpool legend Steve Nicol believes Arsenal's star summer signing Alexis Sanchez was 'awful' during the Gunners' 2-1 Premier League win against Crystal Palace on Saturday.

Arsene Wenger's side needed a late winner from Aaron Ramsey to defeat managerless Palace at the Emirates as Sanchez failed to make an impact.  

Nicol told ESPN: 'Sanchez was awful. His delivery, whether it was set pieces or from a rolling ball, it was horrendous. It was either too long, too short or too high.

Criticism: Liverpool legend Steve Nicol believes Alexis Sanchez was 'awful' against Crystal Palace

'He just didn't get one right, but you have to say he's going to have a World Cup hangover.'

Wenger signed the 25-year-old from Barcelona for £30million, but Sanchez was left with little rest after an impressive World Cup campaign with Chile as he looks to settle into life as an Arsenal player. 

Nicol was also critical of Olivier Giroud's display during Arsenal's Premier League opener, despite the striker playing a prominent role in Arsenal's winning goal.

He added: 'Giroud needs more a rest from the looks of it.' 

Sanchez is in the Arsenal squad preparing to face Besiktas in the Champions League qualifier on Tuesday night and Wenger says the tie is win at all costs.

He said: 'We are desperate to do it because we want to play in the Champions League and we know how big these games are.

'We are desperate to go through. No matter what it costs we want to go through.

'We always have a difficult draw, we had Fenerbahce last year, this time we have Besiktas, so it is difficult.'
