Stevie Wonder's hit Another Star has been chosen as the BBC's theme music for its World Cup coverage in Brazil.

The track originally featured on the singer's huge 'Songs In The Key Of Life' album in 1976 and was released as a single in the UK the following year, reaching number 29.

It will feature in the opening sequence for all the BBC's World Cup programming and will make its debut on a preview show for the competition to be screened on Wednesday on BBC1.

Wonder saw a recent spike in sales for the track when he played it at the Grammy Awards in January as he performed alongside Daft Punk and Pharrell Williams.

The inclusion of the song in the BBC's coverage is said to be the first time the 64-year-old star has allowed his music to be used in such a way.

For the South African tournament in 2010, the BBC's coverage featured a specially commissioned piece by London band Dallas Guild. Other notable years have included Pavarotti's rendition of Nessun Dorma for the 1990 finals in Italy and Faure's Pavane for the 1998 tournament in France.

Ian Finch, senior producer for BBC Sport who looks after the music, said: 'This song perfectly captures the feel-good, carnival atmosphere we will bring to our viewers during the World Cup this summer.

'It is very rare for an artist of this stature to approve the use of their music in this way, so we are thrilled and honoured to have the opportunity.'
