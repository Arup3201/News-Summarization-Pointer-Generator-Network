The family of a five-year-old girl left scarred for life after being 'attacked by an Alsatian' have reacted with fury after the owner was told he will not be prosecuted because of 'insufficient evidence'.

Abbie Varrow was forced to undergo emergency surgery after being left with severed nerves in her nose.

But Darren Bartlett, 42, who was held on suspicion of having a dangerous dog, has now been given his pet back.

After: Abbie has made a good recovery from the attack - but will be left permanently scarred

The schoolgirl was jumping up and down on a trampoline in the back 
garden of her friend Harry Chapman’s house when she says the dog jumped at the 
same time and lunged in Great Notley, Essex.

Abbie will have to see a psychiatrist because she has been sleepwalking and wetting the bed after being mauled by the dog in March.

The Crown Prosecution Service have told Mr Bartlett he will face no further action and he will not even have to pay for the time his Alsatian Sky spent in kennels.

He denies that his dog could have been responsible for the injuries. But if his pet had been behind the mauling, the father-of-five said he would have had her put down immediately.

The electrician said he should have been cleared weeks ago.

Abbie had to have 60 stitches and underwent two hours of surgery at Chelmsford’s Broomfield Hospital following the attack.

Her parents, Tony and Alyson, said their daughter was suffering pain every day as they hit out over the decision not to charge the suspect.

Family fury: Abbie with her parents Alyson and Tony, both 50, at the spot where she was attacked by the dog in March. The animal jumped over the fence, left, and attacked her while she was on the trampoline

Mrs Varrow, 40, said: 'Abbie will be going
through pain every day to sort out the scar tissue on her face. Yet the
owner has got away with it and won’t even have to pay for when it was 
in the kennels.'

The attack on March 27 left Abbie, whose
parents have ten other children from previous relationships, in hospital for two days.

Her father Tony, 40, added: 'Since this has happened, Abbie has been sleepwalking and bed-wetting.

'The
surgeon was happy to discharge her. But then after he heard about 
sleep-walking and bed-wetting, he wants her to see a psychiatrist.'

The family said that Abbie could have been killed by the dog.

'She could have lost her life, and in that respect you have to look at what you have got,' Tony said.

No charge: Father-of-five Darren Bartlett, 42, said his Alsatian Sky, aged three, could not have attacked Abbie Varrow as he was playing with her at the time

'She knows all the people around her are supporting her and in time we hope she can get back to normal.'

Mr Bartlett said his dog could not have been to blame for the attack as she was not playing in the garden at the time of the incident.

'I was playing with her at the time so I know for a fact that she did not do it,' he said.

'If the Old Bill had done their job properly it would never have got to this point and I would have been cleared weeks ago.

'My kids have been asking me every day where Sky is while the police have had her wrongly locked away in kennels for two months – it’s disgusting.'

Mr Bartlett lives at home with his 41-year-old wife Kerry Bartlett and the couple’s five children Georgia, 13, Megan, 11, Rosie, 10, Becky, 8, and Daisy, 8.

The electrician continued: 'If I thought for one minute she had done it I would have had her put down myself.

'There is no way I would allow a dangerous dog in my house with five children.

'What I would ask is if my dog is so dangerous, why was it left in my house for seven-and-a-half hours with five children while cops arrested me?

'It was terrible what has happened to the little girl and I wouldn’t wish it on anyone but what I have to focus on is clearing my name and clearing my dog’s name.'

A
Crown Prosecution Service spokesman said after a careful review, it was
decided there was 'insufficient evidence' for charges to be brought.

He
said: 'Our sympathies are with the victim of this horrendous incident, 
but we were unable to show to the very high standard of proof required 
in respect of criminal proceedings that the owner was negligent in the 
control of his dogs.'
