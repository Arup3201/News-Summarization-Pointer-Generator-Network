Under the hammer: Leonard Nimoy, in his trademark tunic, has his gun drawn as Spock

From Star Trek to The Ten Commandments, some of the most iconic props in Hollywood history are expected to go under the hammer this month.

Memorabilia from dozens of films, including a full-scale alien from the Aliens films and dinosaurs from Jurassic Park, will be sold at 'The Hollywood Auction' in California on December 15.

Included in the sale is James Bond's suit, as worn by Pierce Brosnan in The World is Not Enough, and the tunic (and ears) worn by Spock in Star Trek: The Motion Picture, which is boldly expected to go for more than £75,000.

The iconic Spock tunic was worn by Leonard Nimoy in Star Trek as the mixed human-Vulcan first officer.

Complete with original rank braiding on the sleeves, the piece has been locked away since 1968 - but the colour is still as vibrant as ever.

It was won by a viewer who entered a competition to design a costume for the cult Paramount TV show and has been kept by them ever since.

Spock's pointed screen-worn ears, used in Star Trek: The Modern Picture, could set bidders back £1,250. They are made from foam rubber and measure just two inches square.

Also up for auction are The Tablets 
of Stone used by Charlton Heston when he played Moses in the 1956 film, 
The Ten Commandments.

The tablets come with a letter of authenticity from the creator, Paramount Studios scenic artist A.J. Ciraolo.

He made the tablets to be slightly irregular with craters so they appeared to be carved with God's 'fire bolts'.

Indiana Jones fanatics can purchase the gun used by Harrison Ford in Raiders of The Lost Ark for 50,000 pounds.

The
 six-shot revolver is an original film-modified Smith & Wesson Hand 
Ejector Mk II and was used through the majority of filming in Tunisia.

Ford used the weapon in the shoot-out at the Raven bar - one of the most memorable scenes in the movie.

It is one of only two pistols that exist today that were used by Ford in the production of the film.

Science
 fiction enthusiasts will have the opportunity to purchase the full 
alien warrior creature costume from Aliens for £75,000.

Aliens, directed in 1986, was a sequel to Alien, filmed seven years earlier.

The costume is the finest example of only three full suits that survived the filming more than 25 years ago.

Bidders also have the chance to walk away wearing the suit worn by Pierce Brosnan as James Bond in The World Is Not Enough.

The suit, made by Brioni of Italy is expected to go for around 12,500 pounds.

Inside the interior pocket tag is typewritten: 'James Bond 3 - Pierce Brosnan'.

Indy's gun: The weapon features in an iconic, unscripted scene where Indy shoots a man brandishing a whip - the story is that Harrison Ford was ill during filming, and urged the director to remove an elaborate fight scene in favour of a literal quick shoot

Buyers can also purchase the custom-made hat worn by Audrey Hepburn as Jo Stockton in the film Funny Face, which could fetch up to £18,000.

The film and fashion icon can be seen wearing the memorable hat in the train station scene with Fred Astaire in the musical comedy.

Film fanatics can also leave with a selection of models and motion puppets used in Jurassic Park.

Six models are on offer: a Tyrannosaurus rex, a Velociraptor, a Dilophosaurus, a Triceratops, a Gallimimus and a Compsognathus.

The highly-detailed and finely painted puppets range in value from £1,500 to £5,000.

The models were used in the filming of Jurassic Park before the decision was made to switch to computer-generated imagery (CGI).

Joe Maddalena, President of Profiles in History, organised the auction.

He said: 'We proudly offer an incredible selection of material spanning the silent era to modern films including select pieces from television and music.

'We are certain there is something here for everyone.'

The auction, known as Drama, Action, Romance: The Hollywood Auction, will take place on December 15 in California.

It is a jacket that George Harrison was rarely without when he was a Beatles.

This iconic jacket made appearances in Hamburg and at Liverpool’s Cavern Club from 1960 to 1962 - and it is going up for auction for an estimated £120,000.

The auction will be held at part of the Entertainment and Memorabilia auction at Bonhams, London, on December 10.

Stephanie Connell, director of Bonham's Entertainment memorabilia department, said: 'This leather jacket is instantly recognisable and was an important part of the Beatles image in their early years.

'The jacket will be the highlight of our December Entertainment auction, which includes the Harrison Family collection among over 100 items relating to The Beatles.'

Other items on sale include a model of the shark that attacked a planet in 2010's Doctor Who special, which could only be calmed down by Katheine Jenkins singing to her.
