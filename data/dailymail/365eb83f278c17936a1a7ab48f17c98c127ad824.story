Sarah Msika, who left a pensioner lying on the floor with a broken leg two days before he died, said the man and his wife had refused her help

An agency nurse who left a pensioner lying on the floor with a broken leg two days before he died claimed the man and his wife had refused her help.

Sarah Msika admitted leaving the couple on the floor when she visited them, the Nursing and Midwifery Council heard.

She has now been cleared of a number of other charges including allegations she failed to document her visit, did not tell another nurse about the situation and neglected to adequately clean one of the patients.

An ambulance crew found Patient A, 79, on the kitchen floor covered in her own faeces propped up against a kitchen table.

Medics then discovered her husband, Patient B, lying on his back with a broken leg in the lounge at their home on the outskirts of Norwich, Norfolk.

He died of a blood clot to the lung two days later while his wife passed away six months later.

Giving evidence, Msika insisted the couple had told her they were 'okay' when she visited them on August 4, 2011.

She said: 'If a patient is quite dismissive of help or you are asking them and they are saying they are okay, I am not sure - I wasn't quite sure - of the steps to take.'

David Clark, for the NMC, asked why the nurse had not informed colleagues about Patient B, who was lying on his back.

Msika, who worked as an Agency Nurse for Mayday Healthcare Plc, said: 'I did, I know I did. I said I have got two patients or I left two patients on the floor that need assistance.

'I did tell them that there were two patients that needed assistance.'

Mr Clark asked, 'Why did you not call the emergency services?'

Msika said: 'I have been asked that question so many times. I have asked myself the question so many times.

'I did not at the time think I needed to call an ambulance. The concern that I had was they were on the floor.

'Patient B didn't look distressed or anything and was actually refusing any help.

'I knew nothing about Patient B. He was not my patient, I did not have any background information about him. I had no idea why he was on the floor.

'I think it is quite evident that they were a couple who were quite reluctant to receive any help.'

Msika described the situation as 'challenging' but said she had never intended 'to cause harm to anyone'.

The nurse referred to the NMC code of conduct, which 'states that I should respect and support people's rights to accept or decline care'.

A 'relatively brief' police investigation was mounted into the incident, but Msika faced no criminal charges, the hearing was told.

Msika admitted leaving Patients A and B on the floor of their home, failing to call for emergency assistance and failing to carry out a proper assessment of Patient B.

She also admitted failing to notice that Patient B had fractured his leg and failing to escalate the situation.

Allegations that she failed to document her visit, did not tell another nurse about the situation and neglected to adequately clean Patient A were found not proved.

In relation to the allegation that Msika left Patient A sitting in faeces, panel chairman Dr Andy Thomson said: 'The panel concluded that Mrs Msika would not have been expected to clean Patient A on her own.

'The panel finds that Mrs Msika did not adequately clean Patient A.

'However, as Mrs Msika would not have been expected to clean Patient A on her own, she should have sought assistance in a timelier manner in order to have Patient A cleaned.

'The panel considered that she failed to adequately escalate this matter or seek assistance to clean Patient A

'Therefore, the panel found this charge not proved.'

The allegation that Msika had not told other nurses about the situation was dismissed as it was based on 'mutiple hearsay evidence'.

A charge that she failed to make appropriate records was dismissed due to 'insufficient evidence'.

Msika now faces an anxious wait over her fate as the panel ran out of time before deciding whether she was guilty of misconduct.

The hearing was adjourned until December 9.
