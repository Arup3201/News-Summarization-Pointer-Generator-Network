A shameless yob who starred in a BBC Panorama documentary about Britain's toughest council estate has been given his second ASBO after waging a new campaign of terror against locals.

Jess Volkert, 21, angered millions of viewers by swaggering around the streets in a grey tracksuit during the programme and bragging about his life of crime and coming from the 'gutter.'

Police hauled him back before the courts - just a month after being released from a young offenders institute - after locals on the Shadsworth estate in Blackburn, Lancashire, filed a string of complaints.

Yob: Jess Volkert gained notoriety when he featured on the BBC Panorama programme about Britain's toughest council estates and was filmed bragging about breaking the terms of his ASBO

Shameless: Volkert, 21, has now been banned from going on the Shadsworth estate in Blackburn under the terms of the latest ASBO

They claimed he had subjected them to a campaign of intimidation, harassment and vandalism.

He has now been barred from going into Shadsworth estate or the nearby the 
Delph Estate and parts of the Queens Park area in Blackburn.

He also faces up to five 
years jail if he is caught being drunk in a public place and acting or 
inciting others to act anti-socially in the Blackburn and Darwen areas.

Volkert achieved nationwide infamy last summer when he was featured 
as one of the main hoodlums terrorising locals in Panorama's 
controversial edition called Trouble On The Estate.

He was filmed repeatedly defying the terms
of his first ASBO and terrorising local shopkeeper Tarsem Singh.

As a friend smoked cannabis in front of the 
cameras, Volkert boasted of the ASBO and told programme makers: 'They 
want us to sort ourselves out but we're from the gutter so f*** 'em. 
I'll be back inside by the end of the week.'

At the time the programme was filmed Mr Singh said he had barred 
Volkert at least ten times but he kept returning to the shop, stealing chocolate bars and saying there was 
nothing he could do about it.

Local police said Volkert had been a 'persistent nuisance' and applied for the second ASBO after trying to reason with him.

Volkert was released only last month after he was locked up for breaching the terms of his first anti-social behaviour order.

Two years ago he was brought before the courts after waging a racist two-year 'reign of terror' against Mr Singh, who runs a grocery store on the estate.

Last month he posted pictures on his Facebook page apearing to show his former cell at a young offender institute brimming with household goodies and accompanied by the message: 'This is ma new cell, smashed it in 5 month hahahaa!!!!!!!'

Jobless Volkert became notorious on his
estate in 2010 after he led a gang of yobs which targeted Mr Singh's shop, Rothesay Road, Shadsworth, and hurled racist abuse at him.

In
2011 Volkert pleaded guilty to racially aggravated harassment and was 
jailed for 12 weeks and ordered to abide by the terms of the ASBO.

Mr Singh said he did not want to leave his shop because he was frightened of being assaulted.

Gutter: Volkert gained local infamy by appearing in the documentary called Trouble On The EstateÂ 

Terrorised: Tarsem Singh, who runs the spar on the Shadsworth estate, said he was too scared to leave his shop at one stage for fear of being assaulted by Volkert

'I feel 
vulnerable and intimidated in my own place of work,' said Mr Singh.

'He 
finds it amusing to give me racist abuse and intimidate my customers.

'I
feel that if he is not stopped from terrorising me I will be forced to 
leave my shop by his malicious behaviour. Since I took over the Spar he 
has constantly molested me and my staff, showing disregard for customers
and staff alike.'

PC Mike Kearns community beat manager for the area said: 'Volkert has caused many problems for residents and has made life very difficult for local people.

'This ASBO should send a positive message to the public that the police and courts will not accept this sort of behaviour.

'People should be able to go to their local park or shop without being subject to this kind of disgraceful and unacceptable behaviour.

Locked up: Volkert posted pictures on Facebook of what appears to be his room at the young offenders institution. He was released in January after breaching the terms of his first ASBO

'We've tried to work with him but his behaviour has continued to cause problems for people and I hope this order will go some way in reassuring the community that action has been taken. Any breaches of the ASBO will be dealt with robustly.'

Volkert's latest ASBO comes shortly after he was released from another jail term in January for breaching the first order. He also had previous convictions for assaulting his own father, smashing up a house and beating up his girlfriend's ex-partner.

A Lancashire Police spokesman said: 'Volkert had been responsible for repeated problems in the Shadsworth area.

'Police received regular complaints from local residents about his behaviour including intimidation, harassment, threats of violence and damage to property.

'ASBO's are just one tactic we use to tackle the concerns of anti-social behaviour highlighted by members of the community.'
