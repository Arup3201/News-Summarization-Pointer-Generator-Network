Liam Fox has become the most prominent Conservative yet to announce that he will vote against gay marriage.

The former defence secretary dismissed David Cameron’s ‘absurd’ plans as a form of ‘social engineering’ that is ‘divisive, ill-thought-through and constitutionally wrong’.

In a letter seen by the Daily Mail, Dr Fox said same-sex unions will alienate Conservative Party members and weaken the Church.

He warned that pressing ahead with plans to introduce gay marriage is enraging ‘sections of the British public who are not normally stirred to political anger’, and called for a rethink before ‘things get out of hand’.

The one-time Tory leadership contender said the determination of Mr Cameron and other senior ministers to push through legislation this spring ‘smacks of a form of social engineering of which Conservatives should be instinctively wary’. 

Of the consequences of the policy, he wrote: ‘It has led to the alienation of many loyal and, in many cases lifelong, supporters of the Conservative Party.’ 

He added that the claim by Downing Street that European courts would not be able to force religious groups into conducting same sex weddings ‘carries little credibility with those of us who have watched similar assurances trounced in the past’.

Dr Fox also issued a coded criticism of Mr Cameron for pushing the reforms as a way of winning back floating voters. 

‘What makes the position worse is the way that the legislation increasingly looks as though it was made on the hoof to deal with the political problem du jour,’ he wrote.

Dr Fox, who quit the Cabinet in October 2011 over his close friendship with lobbyist Adam Werritty, delivered his warning in a letter to constituents who have inquired about his views on gay marriage.

He said that as a medical doctor he believes that ‘same sex relationships are a variant of the spectrum of human sexual behaviour’ and should be treated ‘with tolerance and respect’.

However, he denounced proposals to ‘change the definition of marriage for all’, claiming that there is no ‘clamour’ for the change from homosexuals. He also said plans to allow gay marriage in some religious denominations while exempting the Church of England were ‘anomalous and absurd’.

‘The idea of making certain practices illegal for one Christian church, but not others, risks further weakening and splintering Britain’s traditional religion at a time when many Christians feel that they are under threat on a number of secular, political and cultural fronts,’ he continued.

‘To fail to understand this is to risk an affront to a large stabilising and normally acquiescent section of this country which will sow completely unnecessary seeds of dissent.’

Dr Fox rejected the charge levelled at Mr Cameron by some Tories that he has deliberately pursued gay marriage to antagonise the Right of the party as ‘far-fetched’, but concluded: ‘I believe these proposals are divisive, ill-thought-through and constitutionally wrong.

'That is why I will vote against them in the House of Commons.’ 

Dr Fox’s letter emerged as Energy Minister John Hayes, who has also said he will vote against gay marriage, used a magazine interview to press his case.

He told Westminster publication The House that the best way to raise children is within a traditional union.

‘The relationship between my parents and [the one] I have had with my parents was built around a long-term, secure set of commitments, bonds,’ he said. ‘And it’s that secure environment which gives children the best chance of prospering.’ 

He added: ‘Society has a duty to create the circumstances in which those civil institutions can flourish.’ 

A spokesman for Mr Cameron said: ‘The Prime Minister is a strong advocate of gay marriage and this doesn’t change everything. We’re going to press ahead with it as planned.’
