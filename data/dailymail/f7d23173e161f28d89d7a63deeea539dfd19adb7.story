A woman has made it her mission in life to find out why her beloved dad died of a heart attack when he was just 30 years old after a routine operation. 

Jenny Lloyd, 38, a nurse who grew up in Melbourne, has spent her life investigating the case of her dad David Lloyd's death at Royal Melbourne Hospital in 1978.

Channel 7's Sunday Night carried an exclusive report on Ms Lloyd's journey to have her questions answered- she believes her dad died after being given Trasylol or clinical name aprotinin to stop bleeding after he was in a car accident.

Jenny Lloyd has made it her mission in life to find out why her father David Lloyd died when she was two 

David Lloyd, was a father of five, when he passed away in 1978 after being involved in a car accident

Trasylol was taken off the market in 2007 and the drug was used to stop excessive bleeding during surgery. 

Mr Lloyd was in the front seat of his friend's car when it hit another car, he hit his head on the dashboard but doctors initially missed a tear in his bowel and he had lost a lot of blood.

During the operation the father-of-five was given Trasylol, despite the operation being apparently a success he died the next morning from a heart attack.

Mr Lloyd's widow Jeanette told Sunday Night she always wondered why her 30-year-old husband died from the operation.

Ms Lloyd said: 'Mum says he was the best man in the world and she has never met anyone in the world like him.

'He was a skinny little Pommy man, lots of nice little curls, he was a hard worker and he loved all of us kids.' 

David married Jeanette and the happy couple settled in Melbourne and planned for a large family

Mrs Lloyd describes her husband as a 'rascal' adding 'he was a wonderful dad, the children worshipped him and found every excuse to be out there in his company'. 

It wasn't until Ms Lloyd obtained her father's medical records when she was 17 by Freedom of Information did she start to try and uncover why he died. 

In 2011 surgeon Paul Flanagan, who works for the same hospital as Ms Lloyd, looked over Mr Lloyd's notes and saw that he had been given Trasylol. 

He says he believes the drug caused a clot that caused the heart attack.

On January 26 2006 a report into Trasylol by The New England Journal of Medicine was published and it suggested the drug may increase the risk of serious side effects among patients. 

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) describes patients suffering from kidney damage, heart attack and stroke patients.

The FDA said the 'major strength' of the study was the amount of people tested in the trial but there were negative factors because 'patients were not randomly assigned to any of the treatments for preventing bleeding'.

Trasylol was owned by Bayer and it is now under the control of Nordic Pharma

 It said: 'The study outcomes may not truly indicate Trasylol side effects.'

Two observational studies suggested that Trasylol use may increase the risk for kidney damage compared to other drugs.

In September 2006 the FDA then held another Advisory Committee which focused on kidney damage as well as patients with serious allergic reactions to Trasylol.

The FDA then said Trasylol's recommendation should be changed to say it should only be used in patients at high risk of bleeding from cardiac arrest and that the labels should be changed to include warnings of hypersensitivity and kidney damage.

In September 2006 it emerged Bayer had commissioned its own trial and its preliminary data suggested Trasylol increased the risk for in-hospital death in cardiac surgery patients’ which was discussed at a FDA press conference in 2007.

In September 2007 the FDA Advisory Committee carried out another trial into mortality risks the past two studies had suggested. 

Ms Lloyd, 38, has dedicated her life to investigating what happened to her dad and why he died aged 30

Ms Lloyd says the lives of her brothers and sisters were shattered when their father died

The FDA said: 'The Committee didn't find the results compelling enough to warrant a withdrawal so the Committee recommended more study.'

A randomized control clinical trial in Canada then commenced but it was halted because Trasylol appeared to increase the risk for death compared with two other drugs. 

Following those results the FDA requested that Bayer suspend distribution of Trasylol, which it did.

Ms Lloyd travelled to Cologne in Germany to face up to the Bayer shareholder's board and after giving her points she was met with no comment from the chairman. 

She then said: 'How come you can't talk about an intravenous drug that killed my dad and I will keep on talking over you so just stop.' She was applauded by the audience before being escorted off the premise by security guards.

Ms Lloyd travelled to Germany to confront drug company Bayer and ask them her questions

Trasylol is now owned by Nordic Pharma in Paris and they said discussions are taking place to reintroduce Trasylol to Australia.

A Nordic Pharma told Sunday Night: 'The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has undertaken an extensive assessment of all available clinical data on aprotinin...this included clinical studies, published literature, spontaneous reports of side effects and data from manufactures.

Bayer suspended the distribution of Trasylol in 2007 but the new owners Nordic Pharma are in talks to see the drug reintroduced 

Ms Lloyd got her voice heard at the Bayer AGM and still grieves for the father she never knew 

'The CHMP concluded that the benefits of aprotinin outweigh its risk in appropriately managed patients undergoing isolated heart bypass surgery (not combined with other heart surgery), and recommended that the suspension of aprotinin medicines in the European Union be lifted for this revised indication.' 

The Royal Melbourne Hospital told Sunday Night: 'The staff at the Royal Melbourne Hospital provided Mr Lloyd with the best medical care available following his accident in 1978. 

'The medical care given to any patient is guided by the best clinical evidence available at the time. Through research and clinical trials, new medical care and treatments are development, as was the case with the Trasylol in the 1970s for the treatment of trauma.'
