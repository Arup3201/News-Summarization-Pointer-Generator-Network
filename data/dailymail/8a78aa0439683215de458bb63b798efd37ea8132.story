The 47-year-old woman shot in the head execution-style on a beach in Libya beside a former Royal Air Force officer was romantically linked with him, reports claimed last night.

According to sources in New Zealand, Wellington mother-of-two Lynn Howie - believed to be the former wife of an army officer - had travelled to Libya to be with Briton Mark De Salis, 46, before planning to travel on to London.

A friend of Ms Howie told New Zealand media that she had gone to Libya to see ‘her boyfriend’. The friend added: ‘We always said to her “What a place to be in love with somebody”.

‘You always think you are going to 
come home and everything is going to be all right. I hear about all the 
romance and the wonderful things.’

It has not been revealed how the 
couple met. Another friend 
confirmed that Ms Howie was planning to continue on to London after 
first meeting up with Mr De Salis in Libya for a short break.

‘She
 wasn’t even supposed to be there for long,’ said the friend.  ‘She was a
 beautiful person. You couldn’t ask for a bubblier friend.

‘She
 was hard-working and just lots of fun. She lived life to the fullest, 
so it didn’t surprise me that she was going to Libya.’

Ms
 Howie was formerly known as Lynn Gray, said New Zealand media, and she 
was believed to have been recently divorced from an army officer.  

Reporters
 from the Star-Times who went to her former home in Silverstream, north 
of Wellington, seeking more information from her were turned away.

Ms
 Howie worked in New Zealand’s health sector, a profession that 
including roles with the Ministry of Health and Regional Public Health.

Her medical work also included working as a volunteer medic with St John Ambulance and Wellington Free Ambulance.

According to her Linkedin profile, Ms Howie had lived for a number of years in Britain.

She
 had studied at the University of Birmingham, where she had obtained a 
Master of Science degree in environmental health in 2006.

Previously,
 she had obtained a BSc in environmental biology at Nene College 
Northampton, where she studied between 1986 and 1989.

Photographs
 posted on Facebook show Mr De Salis and Ms Howie face down on the sand 
with a picnic blanket, food and drink next to them. Detectives are 
believed to have found tyre tracks near the scene.

Police
 sources said it was possible the presence of an unmarried couple in the
 area had outraged extremist Muslims who might have followed them to the
 beach. Execution-style killings are not unknown in such circumstances.

Mr De Salis was previously a flight lieutenant in the RAF but had been 
working as a manager at an engineering company servicing the oil 
industry at the time of his death.

Mr
 De Salis and Ms Howie were shot in the back of their heads while 
picnicking at a remote spot on the coast about 50 miles west of the 
capital Tripoli.

The couple
 were reported missing by friends in nearby Sabratha city where Mr De 
Salis worked. Their bodies were found by police on Thursday.

The
 authorities have not ruled out robbery as the motive for the attack, 
despite a rucksack and other belongings being left untouched. Both 
bodies have been taken to Tripoli for post-mortem examinations to be 
carried out.

The Foreign 
Office has called for a full investigation and Sabratha officials have 
sent their condolences to the families and the governments of Britain 
and New Zealand, adding: ‘This act is contrary to our morals and the 
values of our religion.’

Mr 
De Salis, originally from Sheffield, had worked in Libya for six years. 
Most recently he was employed as the manager of the power division of 
First Engineering, transporting generators to Libya to provide 
electricity.

Karen De Salis, 48, is based in Cornwall, where she works as a personal assistant
 at the restaurant of TV chef Nathan Outlaw – a protege of Rick Stein’s 
who has appeared on the BBC shows Saturday Kitchen and Great British 
Menu.

The website of the double Michelin-starred restaurant reveals that she moved to Libya in 2007 and returned to the UK in 2011.

Mr De Salis’s family issued a statement saying they were ‘shocked and devastated’ by his death.

They
 described how he liked Libyan people and was ‘a decent and incredibly 
loyal man who was loved by many’. They sent their sympathy to Ms Howie’s
 family.

Last night Mrs De Salis confirmed Mark De Salis was an ex-RAF officer, but said that her family did not want to add anything more.

A
 fellow expat worker and friend in Tripoli told The Mail on Sunday: 
‘Mark was a good guy. He had no argument with Libyan people, he liked 
and understood them.

‘All of
 us are shocked at the terrible news of this shooting. All of his 
friends will be extremely upset. He was kind and popular.’
