Britain has an 'addiction' to sugar which is making us eat the wrong kind of apples, chef Raymond Blanc has said.

The French TV cook said our love for sugar has caused a growth in popularity of sweeter-tasting Pink Lady, Jazz and Gala apples.

This has led to a decline in sales for traditional fruit like the Cox apple, despite the country having perfect conditions for its growth.

French chef Raymond Blanc says British apple-buyers have an 'addiction' to sugar which has led to an increase in sales of sweeter-tasting apples

Speaking to the Sunday Telegraph, Mr Blanc said he was frustrated with Britain eating imported, sweeter apples when it has the 'best climate' for growing its own varieties.

Mr Blanc said: 'The Jazz and the Pink Lady are not great apples. They have been engineered on sweetness, shapes, colours and resistance to disease. But mostly sugar, sugar, sugar. It’s wrong. That’s not the definition of a good food. We are addicted to sugar and the retailers know it. 

'Our taste is now so neutralised that we identify taste with sweetness. Sugar is not a good taste. For any great taste, you need contradictions, a mix of sweet, sour, acid, bitter or salty.

'You have lost the taste of the apple.'

Raymond Blanc says the Cox apple (pictured), which is seeing a decline in sales, has a 'beautiful balance of acidity, sweetness and perfume'

In the last year, the sweeter-tasting Gala apples - Britain's most popular - accounted for 31 per cent of sales, with 32,237 tonnes sold.

Meanwhile Cox's Orange Pippin, which is less sweet but has a less 'artificial' flavour, accounted for 21 per cent, or 21,310 tonnes.

The sugar content of most apples is between 12 and 14 per cent, with a few the highest supermarket-sold apples reaching 20 per cent.

Britons eat 80 per cent more red apples than green ones. 

It is believed that the red appearance is associated with a sweeter taste.

But according to apple experts, it is not necessarily the level of sugar in an apple which makes it sweet.

The Cox apple has a similar level of sugar to Gala and Pink Lady apples, but has a lower acid content. 

Adrian Barlow, the chief executive of English Apples and Pears, which promotes the English apple industry, said: 'The Cox balances sweetness and acidity, but the Gala is all sweetness.

'People associate appearance with taste, but that’s often not the case.'

Mr Blanc, who runs the two Michelin star Belmond Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons restaurant and hotel in New Milton, Oxfordshire, is trying to grow 115 varieties of apple in his large orchard, including two types of Cox apple.

He said: 'They have this beautiful balance of acidity, sweetness and perfume. And they [appear to] have less sugar. But that’s the problem: we are so addicted to sugar that we are not used to these flavours.'
