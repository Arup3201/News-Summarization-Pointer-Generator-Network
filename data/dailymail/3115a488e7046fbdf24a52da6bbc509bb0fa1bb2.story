The onesie has beceome a fashion phenomenon since being introduced to our wardrobes in 2012, and now couples can double up and snuggle up 
this Christmas with the latest in casualwear
 innovation: ‘The Twinsie.’

The design has three legs, four arms and two hoods, and is aimed at couples who want to really cuddle up together.

The twinsie - available for £50 in navy blue, light grey and aubergine - was created by The Original Factory Shop after public consultation on Facebook.

It's here! After the success of the onesie comes the two-person version - the twinsie

It is hoped it will become just as popular as the onesie jumpsuit, which has become a huge trend for adults as well as children

Celebrities spotted wearing the sleepwear include Cheryl Cole and One Directon’s Harry Styles, while even London mayor Boris Johnson has admitted to owning one. 

A spokesman said: 'The Twinsie offers a practical but fun solution for those wanting to stay warm this winter without running up costly energy bills.

'And what a fantastic Christmas present for the person in your life, or even the person you’d like to get closest to!'.

This isn't the first of its kind - in February, George at Asda created the 'Twosie', a gimmick for Valentine's Day.

Comprising of 10 metres of fabric, four 
arms, two hoods and featuring a bunny inspired design, the 'twosie' was designed for the nation’s love 
bunnies to snuggle up together in comfort.

In the run up to Christmas last year, George at Asda sold over one
million onesies, and even opened a dedicated onesie store to keep up with demand.
