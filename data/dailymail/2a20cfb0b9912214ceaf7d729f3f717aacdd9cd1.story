Turn-off: Keeley Hawes and Ed Stoppard as aristocratic Hollands

It was billed as the BBC’s big-budget fightback in television’s  Sunday night ratings battle.

The Corporation hoped its lavish new version of Upstairs Downstairs would serve up the same sort of success enjoyed by ITV’s country house saga Downton Abbey.

But after two series it seems the BBC has admitted defeat – axeing the revived period drama because of falling ratings.

Yesterday it was confirmed that there would not be a third series after more than two million viewers turned off between the first  episode and the last.

The decision comes despite attempts to ‘sex up’ the plot with  the introduction of lesbian archaeologist Dr Blanche Mottershead, played by ER and Moll Flanders star Alex Kingston. She was seen in bed with her bisexual lover, played by Emilia Fox.

But the move failed to pay off, and fans criticised Upstairs Downstairs for its incredulous and at times far-fetched storylines.

In one episode, future US President John F.  Kennedy visited Sir Hallam’s London townhouse for  a dinner party and fell ill after getting drunk.

Other sensational storylines involved beautiful but troubled Lady Persie, younger sister of Lady Agnes, who was played by Claire Foy.

In the space of six episodes she managed to seduce her sister’s husband, give secrets to the Nazis and shoot a maid with a pistol. She later died when she plunged off a balcony.

Upstairs Downstairs was revived in 2010 after 40 years off screen, and when a second six-part series began in January it drew 6.5 million viewers. But within a week 700,000 had switched off and by the time the series ended last month, just 4.45 million were watching.

When the finale of Downton Abbey’s second series was broadcast in November, 10.5 million viewers tuned in.

A BBC spokesman said yesterday: ‘2012 has been a great year for BBC drama but at this stage there are no plans for Upstairs Downstairs to return.’

Lavish: Despite great expense being spend on costumes and sets, the modern version of Upstairs Downstairs was not a ratings winner

The drama, which follows the lives of the ‘upstairs’ residents of 165 Eaton Place in London and their ‘downstairs’ staff, was the brainchild of veteran actresses and best friends Dame Eileen Atkins and Jean Marsh – who played housemaid turned housekeeper Rose Buck in the original series first screened on ITV in 1971.

Dame Eileen and Miss Marsh teamed up again in 2009 to work on a revival for the BBC.

The new version was set a few years after the original as London prepared for the Second World War, and starred Ed Stoppard and Keeley Hawes as aristocrats Sir Hallam and Lady Agnes Holland.

The commission was widely seen as a response to the success of Downton Abbey, set in a Yorkshire stately home and following the lives of the aristocratic Crawley family. Stars include Michelle Dockery as Lady Mary and Jessica Brown Findlay as Lady Sybil.

Upstairs Downstairs has failed despite lavish sets and a big-name cast, including former Spooks actress Miss Hawes, Jewel In The Crown star Art Malik and veteran Anne Reid.

The first series struggled to match the ratings of its ITV rival when it aired over Christmas 2010. However, the BBC commissioned a second series that began in January this year.

Upstairs Downstairs was hit by further setbacks when co-creator Dame Eileen quit the series last August, two months before filming began, amid claims she was unhappy with the direction producers had taken her character Lady Maud Holland.

The 77-year-old Dame said last night: ‘I think it’s sad it’s not going on but you can’t blame the cast, who were wonderful.’

There was another blow when Miss Marsh, 77, was forced to scale back her involvement after suffering a minor stroke.

Miss Marsh – the only cast member to appear in both the original series and the revival – eventually appeared in just two scenes during the six episodes.
