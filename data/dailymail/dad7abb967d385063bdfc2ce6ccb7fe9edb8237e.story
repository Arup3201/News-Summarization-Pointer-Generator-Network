Joshua Bryant was given a suspended sentence after attacking a retired couple but went on the rampage weeks later

A retired couple have hit out at the justice system after a thug who brutally attacked them walked free from court - only to attack his own family and two police officers weeks later.

Joshua Bryant, 21, launched an unprovoked assault on Danny and Pamela Capaldi in the garden of their home in Horfield, Bristol last summer.

But after a judge freed him on a suspended sentence, he went on another rampage earlier this year, attacking four people, including his own mother and sister.

Bryant, 
who was armed with a knife, punched Mr Capaldi, 62, to the ground before
 grabbing his wife around the throat and kicking her in the back.

Mr
 Capaldi suffered a swollen brain and spent two days in hospital and his
 wife has been left in constant pain with a non-healing fracture at the 
base of her spine.

Bryant
 admitted assault causing actual bodily harm and possessing an offensive
 weapon but was spared jail by a judge after a court heard had a mental 
illness.

But exactly a month later he was arrested again following another rampage and has now finally been sent to prison.

Describing
 the latest case, prosecutors said Bryant assaulted his mother and 
sister after an argument over whether he could use their car.

He fled the scene and stole bottles of beer from a shop before police tracked him down and he resisted arrest, prosecutors say.

He
 admitted two counts of assault, one of theft and two of assaulting a 
constable in the execution of his duty and was given a two year sentence
 earlier this week.

Mr and Mrs
 Capaldi, who have six grandchildren, have now said Bryant should have 
been jailed for the first brutal attack on them.

Mrs
 Capaldi, 65, a retired dressmaker, said: 'Bryant left us in such pain. 
We are still not well, and before this week, we were also living in fear
 of him still being on the streets.

'He should never have been given a second chance after what he did to us. I was even scared to have my young grandchildren to play on my street, for fear of what he might do.

'While he was walking free, I was 
constantly checking behind me as I walked down the road. The judge gave 
him a second chance, but he clearly didn't deserve one.'

Mr Capaldi has hit out at the justice system after Bryant committed a second string of offences just weeks after he walked free from court

The couple were at home in Horfield, Bristol last July when their living room window was smashed.

They went out to investigate and saw Bryant - the son of a neighbour - who launched a savage attack when they remonstrated with him.

Judge Alan Large, sitting at Bristol Crown Court in March this year, freed Bryant with a suspended 19-month sentence after hearing he had a mental illness and was not taking medication.

The judge told him: 'Anyone will wonder what on earth Iâ€™m doing not locking you up now. But you had a head injury when you were younger and you have been diagnosed with mental illness.

'Unless this is sorted out, it will be longer and longer in prison. This is quite an exceptional course.'
