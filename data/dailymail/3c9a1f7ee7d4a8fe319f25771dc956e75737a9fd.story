The 15 contestants featuring on Fox's bold new reality TV endeavor Utopia have only been together one week on the remote California set of the 'social experiment', where they will spend the next 12 months building their 'ideal civilization' from scratch.

But already the show is rife with fights and drama, with a contestant already kicked off for smuggling in a cell phone, another evacuated to hospital for severe dehydration and one revealing a secret pregnancy.

Add to that the skinny dipping and polyamorous contestant Dedeker - who kisses her two boyfriends and girlfriend goodbye before entering the compound north of LA County - and Fox appears to be making good on the reported $50 million they have invested in the project. 

The show - which premieres Sunday night - has already developed a large online following, after a live stream of the Utopia grounds made available this week garnered 1 million viewers, according to Entertainment Weekly.

Paradise?: The California set of Utopia has no heat, no electricity and no plumbing, but has a self-filtering lake for water and a barn, which provides the participants with two dairy cows and twelve chickens

EW, who were given the first glimpse of the series, said two of the players have already removed themself from the group to start their own camp.

Another, a Midwesterner called Hex who describes herself a 'huntress', had to be taken to hospital for severe dehydration.

The Utopian society has no heat, electricity or plumbing, but has a a self-filtering lake for water and a barn with two dairy cows and twelve chickens.

One major fight is said to have already broken out between one man, Josh, who was drunk at the time, and Dave, an ex-con and former drug dealer recently released from prison.

EW reported that Dave had to be removed by security following the altercation.

Before the cameras even started rolling, a female contestant was caught with a cellphone, which she had reportedly smuggled in order to look up the fellow players online.

It is not known whether the woman will be edited out of the show.

The 'secret' pregnancy appears to be one of many surprising casting manouvres, which also includes are intensely relgiious pastor who has offered to give baptisms in the lake

At least two couples have already formed as well, according to EW.

The pregnant contestant has not yet been named but is due in December.

Opening night: The show premieres on Sunday September 7, 2014 at 8pm

Fox is gambling large on the series, investing millions of dollars in the show that challenges the 15 participants to create their own mini societies on the secluded piece of land.

'Utopia' is what the network called its 'boldest' and 'most groundbreaking social experiment.'

People from all walks of life were selected from 5,000 applicants to be dropped into the secluded plot of land in California, where they will build their ideal civilization for one year

The 'Utopians' start with no more than $10,000 and have to decide how to use it to develop their new economy and develop more of the land.

Fifteen participants will remain in isolation for a year while they build a new civilization for Fox's new reality behemoth, 'Utopia'

Aside from a barn with a couple of cows and some chickens, participants have to build new structures and find their own food

The show will air on Tuesday and some Fridays, and is expected to be Fox's big programming bet this fall

The roster also includes a bellydancer, a naturalist, a Manhattan lawyer, a Libertarian and a veterinarian technician.

'This is the most pure form of reality that I have ever produced in my career,' boasts executive producer John de Mol, the man behind 'Big Brother.

'Utopia,' which debuts on Sept. 7 with a three-night premiere, comes with 200 crew members, hundreds of cameras and round-the-clock video streaming.

Fox has scheduled the show for Tuesdays and some Fridays, counting on it to replace 'X Factor' and 'American Idol.' The network will also stream the show online 24/7.

The 15 participants on 'Utopia' come from all walks of life, from a belly dancer to a veterinarian technician, a chili farmer and a pregnant woman

But so far, the series has seen plenty of snags.

Insiders say the network stands to spend $50 million on just 20 episodes — and is also struggling internally with a group of new producers involved in the show, TheWrap reported.

'The bill has arrived and it is on the very high end of staggering,' one network executive told the news outlet.

Executive producer Conrad Green told Variety the cost for the set was 'not insignificant,' though he wouldn't give any more details.

And this is a time of internal changes at Fox.

The man behind the project, ex-chairman Kevin Reilly, moved on in June — leaving a group of incoming executives to inherit the schedule he created, Variety reported.

It is also the first big project for Simon Andreae, in charge of alternative, who joined the network in October.

The dutch version of the show premiered in January and has thus far been a success, industry insiders say.
