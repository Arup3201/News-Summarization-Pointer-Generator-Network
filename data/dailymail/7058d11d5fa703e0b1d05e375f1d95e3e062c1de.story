Inspired by the classic arcade game Whack-a-Mole, a pet owner has taken the game to the next level with Whack-a-Kitty.

With moles hard to come by these days, they instead cut six holes on the top of a box, filled it with kittens and got whacking.

The YouTube video has been gaining traction across social media since being uploaded earlier this year.

Too cute: the first kitten pops their head through, only to be softly whacked back into the box

Although it may look like a cute game, is there a downside?

Kristina Vesk, Cat Protection Society of NSW CEO, was more worried about the wellbeing of the cats featured in the video than their welfare: 'My first reaction was to wonder where the mother cat was and that I hope she will be desexed now, as there are so many kittens and not enough homes.'

'The toy being used is clearly soft and the person is dealing with it gently.'

Sydney Dogs and Cats Home spokersperson Claire Garth agrees, and told MailOnline: ‘There are a lot of cute, and a lot of not-so-cute animal videos on the internet, we'd put this one in the cute category.’

Too scared to pop out: two kittens peer through the holes, carefully planning when they would pop their heads through

Be careful: As one of the kittens pops it's head up, another retreats after getting a gentle whack back down

‘We always encourage people to be careful when filming their animals, and we generally find most people are.'

World Society for the Protection of Animals (WSPA) spokesperson Tom Shennan told MailOnline: 'It is difficult to determine whether or not the kittens in the video are in distress.'

'If the kittens were forced to participate in this game an extended period of time, it's possible that they could become distressed'

Had enough: one of the kittens is sick of playing, refusing to lower itself back into the box

Had enough: this kitten refuses to play anymore, clawing their way out of the box instead

'While games are an important stimulation for pets, animals must not be forced into participation, particularly when they can involve being put inside a closed box,' WSPA spokesperson Tom Shennan said.

Cat Protection Society of NSW CEO Kristina Vesk agrees: 'I don’t think it would be the favourite game of the kittens – better to play games with them that they would really enjoy.'

But do you lose points if one of the kittens escapes? Considering how difficult it is not to let the cat out of the bag – or box, in this case – we’ll let it slide.
