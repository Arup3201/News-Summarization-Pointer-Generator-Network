A couple in Evergreen, Colorado, were sitting down to their morning coffee on Monday when they were shocked to see a young elk bouncing around on a trampoline in their backyard.

The couple live in a rural area and while it wasn’t all that surprising to see a small herd of elk grazing in the woodland surrounding their home, it was the first time they'd seen an animal have a go aboard the bouncy contraption. 

Greg Chase caught the unusual sight on his cellphone and then posted it online.

‘I watched this young elk poking his head into the entrance of the trampoline when all of a sudden he decides to jump in for some fun!’ Chase wrote in the description on his YouTube video.

The footage was posted on Monday and has already attracted more than 36,000 views.

During the three and a half minute clip, the foolhardy animal attempts to figure out just how he is going to get himself out of his bizarre predicament.

Several times he breaks out into a burst of energy, but succeeds only in falling over as he tries to acclimatise to the sensation of keeping his balance.

While most of the herd seem relatively unconcerned about the fearless elk's predicament, he does have one friend who seems worried and remains focused on what's happening to his mate on the trampoline.

‘The elk’s friend on the outside actually looks like he wants to get in and join the fun while the mom looks on,’ Chase wrote.

When Chase goes to see if he can help, his partner Shauna takes over filming and provides her own commentary. 'This has gotta be a first,' she said.

At one point, Shauna suggests that they might have to shoot the elk after he puts one of his feet through a hole in the trampoline.

Chase clarifies on his YouTube account that his wife over-reacted because she is an animal lover and didn't want to see it suffer.

'The
only reason my wife suggested doing so was to keep it from suffering if
it got too badly hurt due to the hole in the tramp,' Chase wrote.

'We 
recently watched in horror as a fox was strangled to death in our 
neighbor’s soccer goal netting.'

Fortunately the elk wasn't injured and he soon managed to make his way back out through the hole in the safety net through which he had originally entered.

Once free, he and his best friend bound off together looking for their next adventure. 

‘We see a lot of crazy Elk behavior here in Evergreen, CO....but this Takes The Cake for sure!’ wrote Chase.
