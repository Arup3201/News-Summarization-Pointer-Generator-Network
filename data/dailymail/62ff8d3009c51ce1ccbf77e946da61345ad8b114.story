Manchester United have reportedly revived their bid to sign Ander Herrera from Athletic Bilbao.

The Old Trafford club has this week increased their offer for Luke Shaw at Southampton and been rebuffed in an opening offer for Thomas Vermaelen of Arsenal.

Herrera was a target for David Moyes last summer and he had considered returning with a bid after following the 24-year-old's progress.

Race against time: Herrera's buyout clause at Bilbao will increase on June 30, which could speed up a move to Old Trafford

Sportsmail reported that United had the Spanish midfielder under consideration but would have to move quickly as his buyout clause is due to increase after June 30.

United were keen to see if Herrera would see out his contract and join next summer as a free agent, however, Spanish radio station Cadena Ser last night reported a bid had gone in and talks are expected to conclude a transfer over the coming days.

The deal would cost United £31million for a stylish midfielder who has also been courted by Manchester City and Barcelona.
