A RAPIST who won £5million on the  lottery was jailed yesterday for fraudulently claiming £13,000 in benefits.

Edward Putman told the authorities he was destitute and about to be evicted – despite having millions in the bank.

The housing and council tax benefit and income support he received amounted to only four weeks’ interest on his jackpot.

The fraud was revealed after he tried to buy his council house in cash and suspicious officials began probing his finances.

Cheat: Edward Putman, left, in September 1999 
and right, at a recent court appearance. He began receiving income 
support in 2000 after being incapacitated by anxiety issues and his 
benefits were suspended in 2009

Putman, 46, who had declined publicity
after his 2009 win, first appeared in court last month, after which his
ex accused him of concealing his fortune to avoid paying maintenance to
their son.

Judge Andrew Bright jailed him for nine months after hearing
how the multi-millionaire wrote to the Department for Work and Pensions
and his council to say he was borrowing money and selling possessions 
to make ends meet.

Sentencing him at St Albans Crown 
Court in Hertfordshire, the judge said: ‘This was planned and 
premeditated and, I am satisfied, was motivated by sheer greed. Though 
you had won £5million on the lottery you carried on claiming benefits to
which you were not entitled. Your greed was on a scale which, frankly, 
defies belief.’

Putman’s rape victim, who was 17 when he attacked her in 1991, told the Mail: ‘It’s nice to know that he is behind bars.

‘He had the world at his fingertips and could have done what he wanted with that money.’

Putman’s image of respectability in a 
£600,000 detached house in Kings Langley, Hertfordshire, unravelled 
after he appeared in court on June 12.

His ex-partner Gail, 51, whose 
surname the Mail has agreed not to use, came forward to say: ‘He paid 
less than £200 maintenance in 12 years.’

Gail’s 22-year-old daughter from 
another relationship also accused the bricklayer of abusing her by 
making her undress in front of him when she was a child.

‘Eddy comes across as a charmer but he
is really a Jekyll and Hyde character,’ she said. ‘He’s won millions 
and it couldn’t have happened to a less deserving person. He’s a 
monster.’

His rape victim, who was three months’
pregnant when he attacked her in Milton Keynes, called him a 
‘psychopath’ and said he punched her so hard during the attack she 
thought her head would ‘cave in’.

Putman was jailed for seven years in 
1993 for the offence, as well as indecent assault and intimidating a 
witness. He served four years.

When his benefits were suspended in 
2010 he wrote asking for them to be reinstated. He said: ‘I have been 
borrowing from family and friends for my daily needs. I have no money in
my bank account.

‘Money I have managed to get has been from selling my belongings, as I will not need them any more, as I expect to be evicted.’

In fact, he was living in his new home
and had a fleet of cars parked outside, including a BMW X5 M Sport and a
BMW M3 convertible. The Lotto winner admitted two offences of failing 
to notify the authorities of a change in circumstances.

Putman, who had faced a maximum seven-year term, spent most of yesterday’s hearing staring at the floor as he sat in the dock.

Afterwards he released a statement which said: ‘I can only apologise for the offences I have committed.’

Sentenced: The fraudster was told he was motivated by 'sheer greed' at St Alban's Crown Court
