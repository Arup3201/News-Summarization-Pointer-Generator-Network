If you're a little bit geek but ever so chic, you'll love Stiletto Wars - a new game, best described as Candy Crush on heels.

The addictive app has been devised by Harrods to mark the opening of the store's new luxury shoe salon, Harrods Shoe Heaven, and is free to download.

But the best part? Shoeaholics will have the chance to win their dream pair of heels - in the real world, not just in cyberspace.

Then at the end of October, everyone who has submitted their scores since the game’s launch will be entered into a prize draw for a chance to win a Harrods VIP experience for two.

As well as a £500 gift card, the prize draw winner and a guest will enjoy a personal shopping experience in Harrods Shoe Heaven VIP room plus a pampering Urban Retreat package at Harrods, which includes a manicure, pedicure and cut and blow-dry.
