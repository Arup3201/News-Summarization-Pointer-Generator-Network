Open all hours: The Royal Mail is to open parcel delivery centres on Sundays as part of a trial

Royal Mail yesterday revealed plans to tackle the boom in online shopping by delivering parcels and opening sorting offices on Sundays.

The move, which has been backed by unions, will be a relief to those who miss the post during the week and end up wasting their Saturday mornings queuing at their local office to pick up a parcel.

It is also a sign of the increasing importance of parcels to Royal Mail – it handles more than one billion of them every year – which will today reveal its first annual financial results since it was privatised last October.

As letters continue their serial decline because of text messaging, social media websites and email, the increasing popularity of online shopping means that parcels now account for more than half of the company’s revenues.

Yesterday the Communication Workers’ Union (CWU), which bitterly opposed the privatisation of the company last year, welcomed the news but said working on a Sunday must be voluntary and is negotiating a higher pay rate for those who choose to do so.

At present, sorting offices are only open from Monday to Friday as well as Saturday morning. 

Starting this summer, around 100 of Britain’s 1,400 busiest delivery offices will be open every Sunday afternoon.

If the pilot scheme proves successful, it will be expanded and become permanent.

Parcelforce Worldwide, Royal Mail’s express parcel business, will start Sunday deliveries next month when selected online retailers will be able to offer it to their customers.

This will be open to around 97 per cent of Britain’s addresses, but excludes Northern Ireland and some remote areas.

The group have done a deal with the Communications Workers Union (CWU) to secure the changes

Royal Mail will also trial delivering 
parcels between businesses within the M25 on Sundays and open its 
distribution network later at the weekends.

As
 a result, people who shop online at the weekend have a better chance of
 receiving their package on Monday, rather than waiting until later in 
the week for it to arrive.

Royal
 Mail chief executive Moya Greene said: ‘Through these new Sunday 
services we are exploring ways to improve our flexibility and provide 
more options for people to receive items they have ordered online.

‘The support of the Communication Workers Union has enabled us to respond quickly to a changing market.’

Royal Mail chief Moya Greene says the move will offer 'greater flexibility' to people who order things online

In
 a statement, Royal Mail said: ‘The investment in extended opening hours
 builds on the choices already available to people who are not at home 
when delivery is attempted.’

And
 Nick Langdon, managing director of Royal Mail parcels, told Radio 4’s 
Today programme yesterday that parcels are ‘a big part of our future’.

He
 added: ‘Letters remain extremely important to us, and will do for many 
years to come. Parcels now represent over half of our revenue in the 
UK.’

Dave Ward, the CWU’s 
deputy general secretary, said: ‘We appreciate that in order to stay 
competitive in a broadly unregulated sector Royal Mail has to expand its
 services to its customers. We believe that offering Sunday delivery and
 collection services is the right response from the company.

‘With
 ever-increasing numbers of people opting to shop online, Sunday 
services are necessary to deal with the growing demand in parcel 
delivery.

‘The union is 
negotiating with Royal Mail to ensure that postal workers who are 
affected by these changes receive good terms and conditions and, where 
appropriate, that work is performed on a voluntary basis.’

The first official postal service was formed when Brian Tuke was appointed 'Master of the Posts' by Henry VIII in 1512 and the Royal Mail was established in 1516.

But the first public service was not created until more than a century later, during the reign of Charles I, when letters began being carried between posts by 'post-boys'. Parliament then fixed postal rates depending on number of pieces of paper and distance in 1657.

In 1793, official Letter Carriers were given a uniform of a scarlet coat and black hat. Despite the new clothes making the men more look more respectable, they were primarily designed to stop them sneaking into pubs while on shift.

The first railway postal carriage on which letters were sorted in transit was brought in 1838, a system which continued until 2004.

The world's first adhesive stamp was brought in in 1840, called the Penny Black, and 68 million were used in their first year.

The first pillar boxes came in 1852, and were originally green to blend in with the landscape, but red ones were brought in from 1874 after people complained of finding them difficult to locate.

The first postcode came in 1959 before the Post Office was changed from a government department to a statutory corporation by a 1969 act of Parliament.

The current government then allowed for up to 90 per cent of Royal Mail to be privatised, with at least 10 per cent of shares to be held by Royal Mail employees.

Business Secretary Vince Cable was accused of selling the company off on the cheap after the original stock market price of £3.3billion rose to more than £5billion after the company was floated.

There are now over 12,000 Post Office branches and 52 Parcelforce Worldwide depots around the country.
