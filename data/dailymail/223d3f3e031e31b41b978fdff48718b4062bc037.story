The rapper with loose connections to hip-hop's famed Wu-Tang Clan who cut his penis off before jumping off a second-floor balcony last week was high on PCP, it was revealed Friday.

Additionally, Andre Johnson - whose stage name is Christ Bearer - posted on social media that he feels 'blessed;' after he used a serrated steak knife to cut off his genitals before jumping from the balcony of a North Hollywood apartment building about 1 a.m. Wednesday.

Police officers who were called to the apartment tried to talk Johnson off of the balcony before he said 'OK' and jumping.

PCP: Despite initial reports that drugs weren't involved, it was revealed Friday that Johnson had PCP in his system when he cut off his penis and jumped off a balcony

Johnson was rushed to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where doctors weren't able to reattach his severed penis.

The day after the grisly incident, Johnson posted 'Peace -- feeling blessed' on his Facebook page, according to TMZ. The post has since been deleted.

Johnson
 is in the group Northstar. The act was  discovered by Wu-Tang producer 
and rapper RZA in 1998. He produced their 2004 debut album RZA Presents 
Northstar.

Since the incident, the Wu-Tang Clan has distanced themselves from the troubled rapper, with RAZA releasing a statement saying he has had nothing to do with Northstar for years.

Rapper
 friends told TMZ about the incident, saying happened so quickly, that 
by the time friends made it to the ground floor, Mr Johnson was on his 
feet and 'running around screaming', the site reported.

'If
 this behavior is attributed to drugs of such we hope he gets help in 
this as well. However none of this is Of Tribute to the Wutang clan 
movement, way of life or legacy.'
