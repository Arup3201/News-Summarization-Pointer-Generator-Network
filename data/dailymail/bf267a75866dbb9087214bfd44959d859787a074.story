For a hedgehog, it could be considered quite a disadvantage – and the discovery of a baby hedgehog without spines has baffled animal experts.

Six-week-old Baldy was found wandering in a garden in Duntocher, Dunbartonshire, last Wednesday. The creature had survived despite not having spines, which develop quickly after birth.

Staff at Hessilhead Wildlife Rescue Centre near Beith, Ayrshire, say Baldy is ‘confident and healthy’ but may never be able to return to the wild.

Captive: Staff at Hessilhead say Baldy is ‘confident and healthy’ but may never be able to return to the wild

Sensitive: Without his spines, Baldy’s skin is very sensitive and dry and is being treated daily with tea tree oil

Gay Christie, who runs the centre with her husband Andy, said: ‘It’s a total mystery.’

Hedgehogs rely on their spines for insulation as well protection. Without his spines, Baldy’s skin is very sensitive and dry and is being treated daily with tea tree oil.
