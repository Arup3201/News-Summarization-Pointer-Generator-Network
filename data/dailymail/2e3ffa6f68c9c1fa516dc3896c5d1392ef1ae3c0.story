Seeing a shark swimming nearby can be a little unnerving. So imagine the shock of a walker who saw one as he strolled by a river ten miles from the sea.

Jody Gibbons, 27, filmed the 5ft-long shark on his mobile phone as it circled in shallow water at the weekend.

Thought to be a harmless smooth-hound shark, it probably swam up the River Stour from mouth of the estuary, where they are commonly found, before becoming trapped behind a sluice gate after the tide went out.

Jaws: Mr Gibbons spotted the shark when he saw a fin sticking out of the water

The 27-year-old marketing executive 
grabbed his phone to capture video footage of the shark so his friends 
would believed he had seen it in the village of Cattawade.

He said: 'We walked past and saw a big fin sticking up out of the water and thought "that must be a big fish".

'That thought quickly became "that's a massive fish" and then I realised it was a shark. I really could not believe what I was seeing.

'We have walked along there so many times before but never had I seen anything like that before.'

It is believed to be a Smooth-hound Shark, which is more commonly found in coastal waters around the country.

Coast: According to the Shark Trust there are 35 species of shark that can be found around the coastal waters of Britain

Mr Gibbons, of Lawford, Essex, spent more than an hour with his college lecturer father, 53, watching the shark on Sunday.

There are more than 30 species of sharks which regulary inhabit the coasts of Britain.

According to The Shark Trust, at least 21 of these can be found on the UK coastline all year round.

Among those that can be spotted throughout the year are the Smallspotted Catshark and the Basking Shark.

There have also been sightings of a range of other sharks, including just last week when a pack of killer blue sharks were seen off the coast of Cornwall.

While the species is normally confined to the mid-Atlantic, diver Nick Robertson-Brown spotted the pack just five miles from the coast.

Meanhwile, MailOnline has today also reported on fisherman Wayne Comben who battled for two hours to reel in one of the biggest sharks ever caught in British waters.

Mr Comben, along with fellow angler Graeme Pullen, caught the 14ft thresher shark about a mile south of St Catherineâ€™s Point on the Isle of Wight.

He has given a 'conservative' estimate that the shark was at least 4ft long but thinks it could have been as long as 5ft.

He
added: 'It was an amazing sight to see and I knew I had to film it, 
otherwise my friends would not have believed a word I was saying.

'The water was quite shallow where we saw it and its fin was sticking out of the water - it was like a scene from Jaws.

'You do get people fishing here and there is a beach further up the river but it's surprising to find a shark.'

Mr Gibbons informed the Environment Agency and the RSPCA of his sighting.

He said: 'We got really close to it 
and could see it was as long as some metal railings in the water so we 
had a good gauge to work out how big it was.

'I really was shocked and amazed - I did not for one minute expect to see something like that in the river.

'It was just fascinating watching it swimming around.'

David
Warner, commodore from the nearby Stour Sailing Club, said: 'We have 
had sharks in the lowest point of the river before but not up where it 
was seen.'

According to the Shark Trust there are 35 species of shark that can be found around the coastal waters of Britain.

Quite a way: The shark was spotted 10 miles inland up the River Stour
