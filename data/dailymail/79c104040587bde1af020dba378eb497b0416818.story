Bayern Munich star Arjen Robben has joked that he was 'bitten by a crocodile' after appearing at training with a bandage on his hand. 

The winger, who signed for Bayern from Real Madrid for a reported £22 million fee in 2009, sustained the injury while weight training at the club's mid-season camp in Qatar.

He joked to Dutch magazine TZ that it was like 'being bitten by a crocodile' while trying to fetch a ball from the hole during a game of billiards.
