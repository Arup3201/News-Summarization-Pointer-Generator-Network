Nicky Morgan said she 'probably would' vote for gay marriage if she had the chance again 

The Education Secretary yesterday revealed she has changed her mind about gay marriage and now supports it.

Citing her Christian faith, Nicky Morgan voted against the Government’s gay marriage law in May last year, insisting such unions should only be ‘between a man and a woman’.

But yesterday, in the latest in a series of U-turns since she became Education Secretary, she claimed her vigorous opposition was partly a question of her representing her constituents’ views. 

And she appeared to accuse backers of the controversial law of failing to do enough to win her to their side.

Mrs Morgan was promoted to the Cabinet, taking Michael Gove’s education portfolio in the July reshuffle. She was also made the minister for women and equalities.

Yesterday she launched a £2million fund to help tackle homophobic bullying in schools. Promoting the move on the gay website Pink News, she praised ‘all of the great advances this country had made in securing LGBT (Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender) equality’.

She was heckled over her previous opposition to same-sex marriage at a Pink News awards ceremony in Westminster. As she urged the audience to ‘judge me on my record’, one critic repeatedly shouted ‘you voted against it’.

Mrs Morgan had admitted her change of heart in an earlier interview on Radio 4, saying she supported ‘absolutely anyone who enters into a commitment’ and claimed she had learned ‘an awful lot’ about the issue since taking on the equalities brief.

She said that at the time of the vote she had been swayed by strong opposition among her Loughborough constituents, and said she wished more supporters of gay marriage had asked her to vote a different way. At the same time, she said she had regarded the Bill as an ‘issue of conscience’. 

Asked if she would change her vote Mrs Morgan said: ‘I probably would. But at the end of the day, as a Member of Parliament, I’m also here to represent my constituents and, as I’ve said, I had a request by ten to one in favour of asking me to vote against it. I wish people had come forward earlier to say “Actually, we’d like you to support it”.

‘I suppose for some people it was, perhaps, obvious but it was something we needed to discuss and to debate.

‘I particularly welcome the fact that 1,400 couples, probably more by now, have entered into same-sex marriages since we legislated for it in this year.

‘I do understand, of course, people who say “Well, she voted a particular way and now she’s equalities minister. We are all, as Members of Parliament, here to represent, to listen, to change minds.

‘But I had a lot of constituents who asked me to vote in a particular way and I listened to them and it was an issue of conscience too, but I have certainly learnt an awful lot doing this job.’

When the Bill came before the Commons, two Cabinet ministers and ten junior ministers joined 161 MPs in opposing it. The measure passed with a majority of 205 on a free vote.

Mrs Morgan’s opposition to the Bill forced David Cameron to put another minister in charge of taking the remainder of the Government’s changes to same-sex marriages through Parliament when he promoted Mrs Morgan.

She said yesterday that calling someone ‘gay’ in a hostile way was an example of homophobic bullying, which she said ‘destroys people’s education, stops them attending school and it’s something we very much want to see eradicated’.
