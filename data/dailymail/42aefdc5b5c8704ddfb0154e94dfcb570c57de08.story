Many Americans hate Christmas shopping so much, they'd literally rather have a run-in with the dentist than be subjected to too much of it.

Shopping app GameIt commissioned a survey on over 1,000 Americans and found than 32per cent of them agreed with the statement: 'I would rather have root canal treatment than be forced to go Christmas or Holiday shopping every day for weeks on end.'

Men, Southerners and over-55s were found to despise the annual treasure hunt for Christmas necessities most.

Bah humbug! In a survey on over 1,000 Americans, 32per cent agreed with the statement, 'I would rather have root canal treatment than be forced to go Christmas or Holiday shopping every day for weeks on end'

GameIt's founder Bryce Johnson points out that 32per cent of the U.S. population equates to over 100million Americans who can't abide Christmas shopping.

'Personally, I’d rather have my molars extracted without an anesthetic than have to go Holiday shopping every day,' he says.

Apparently, geography plays a role. Thirty-six per cent of Southerners quizzed would opt for the root canal option, compared to 26per cent of North-Easterners.

Glum: Men's aversion to shopping in general is such an entrenched stereotype, there's even an Instagram account devoted entirely to people sharing examples of it, Miserable Men Shopping (pictured)

Face of thunder: The account boasts over 137,000 followers and gets particularly busy during the holiday season

Defeated: Last year, Americans forked out a collective $52billion during the holiday period, with an average spend of around $700 each on Christmas gifts

Over-55s were marginally more disdainful of the practice than youngsters, with 35per cent of them choosing the same option versus 31per cent of under-55s.

And unsurprisingly, 53per cent of men versus 43per cent of women would surrender to the dentist's chair if it meant they didn't have to drag themselves through the shops.

'The crowds, the frenzy, the buying stuff you can’t afford. No wonder folks hate it,' laments Mr Johnson, who launched his trivia-themed app as a way to turn shopping into a game.

According to statistics site Statista, a quarter of the average American's personal spending takes place in December.

Last year, Americans forked out a collective $52billion during this period, with an average spend of around $700 each on Christmas gifts.

The average number of gifts expected per person is 12. No wonder so many of us would rather have our teeth pulled.
