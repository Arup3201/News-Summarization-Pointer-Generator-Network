Comedian Nathan Fielder is at it again, once
more at the expense of his fans’ parents.

Known for his controversial Twitter pranks, this time Comedy Central's
Fielder had his almost 100,000 followers text their parents asking 'If you
think u gave someone an STD is it illegal not to tell them? Asking for a friend'
and then tweet the responses.

Mostly good for a laugh, responses ranged from worried to
enraged as parents weren’t sure how to react to the question.

Past pranks include having his followers text parents telling them
they 'have two grams for $40' and telling people they are dating that they 'haven’t
been fully honest' with them, then ignoring their responses for an hour. Both
pranks ended up with far more disastrous results including punishments, unwanted
confessions and the end of hundreds of relationships.

Responses ranged from dismissal and laughter to anger and
fear.

Jokes on you: Comedy Central's Fielder had his almost 100,000 followers text their parents asking “If you think u gave someone an STD is it illegal not to tell them? Asking for a friend” and then tweet the responses

One father, in denial his little angel could do anything
wrong, told his daughter to stop hanging out with 'those kinds of people'
before her non-responses resulted in him demanding she go home immediately.

WTF: Parents in denial and even helping children hide their alleged indiscretions

Another father, perhaps inadvertently confessing his own
sins, told his son of a clinic he knew of and to not tell his mother.

Not sure: Parents were divided over whether or not their promiscuous children were really in trouble

Sit tight: Some parents took a more proactive approach to their children's alleged 'friends' problems

While one parent rushed home, the other one said to sit
tight while she consulted the expert – the Fresno County Health Department.

Outrage: Some parents were furious when asked if it was illegal to give someone an STD and not tell them

And finally, this mother had a solution to all her son’s
problems.
