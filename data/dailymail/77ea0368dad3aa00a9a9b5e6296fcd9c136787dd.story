A British jihadi fighting for the Islamic State in Iraq has become notorious on social media for his love of junk food - confessing that he even dreams about  KFC and Nandos while waging jihad.

Known by the nom de guerre Abu Hamza al-Britani, the 21-year-old Londoner of Pakistani origin is regularly teased about his insatiable appetite by his fellow ISIS militants, who have branded him 'fat' and advised him to stop eating so much ice cream.

As well as his apparent gluttony, Abu Hamza's other favoured topic of conversation is the pet kitten he left behind when travelling to fight on the frontline. The terrorist has repeatedly posted messages about and photographs of the ginger cat named Anbar, which he described as 'my princess'. 

Although Abu Hamza spends much of his time talking about his pets and uploading photographs of junk food, the terrorists shares the same chilling desire to die in the name of radical Islam as other Britons fighting for the terror group, with his Twitter biography claiming he is 'seeking Martyrdom'.

Food on the brain: Abu Hamza al-Britani has become notorious on social media for his love of junk food - confessing that he even dreams about KFC and Nandos while waging jihad

Abu Hamza's endless appetite and obsession with junk food has seen his fellow militants repeatedly poke fun at his weight. 

'You're pretty fat. You should lay off the ice cream,' one of his Twitter followers posted recently.

Abu Hamza appears to take such criticism in his stride, however, responding to the user with: 'Is it my fault you're eating salads like a rabbit?'

In another exchange, Abu Hamza was asked: 'If you had to eat only three things for the rest of your life, what would you eat?' The militant responded with: 'Unhealthy. Spicy wings, cake, chips.'

Such is his love of calorific cuisine that even Abu Hamza's Twitter page is decorated with food, including what appear to be barbequed chicken legs and rice.

In a recent post he told his followers about a dream he'd had where he was ordering food from KFC, Nandos and his favourite Thai restaurant. He added that his favourite types of foods are 'Indian, Thai and Italian.'

When one of his followers asked if he was fat, Abu Hamza replied: 'No, praise be to God. But I love food and I'm cooking as I type.' Minutes later he revealed he was boiling vast quantities of pasta. 

Masked and armed: On his Ask.Fm account, Abu Hamza revealed that he had waited for five months to tell his mother that he had joined ISIS. When he eventually did, the terrorist claims his mother burst out laughing in disbelief before suggesting that she supported his actions by branding him and fellow jihadis 'lions'

Glutton: Abu Hamza never seems to miss an opportunity to eat something unhealthy, even admitting that he gorges on junk food while working as a guard and fighting for the terror group

Abu Hamza never seems to miss an opportunity to eat something unhealthy, even admitting that he gorges on junk food while working as a guard and fighting for the terror group.

'Cheese and onion crisps, tropical juice on the floor with my klash [AK47],' he recently wrote before adding:  'Reloading my PKC chain [heavy machine gun] with bullets being fired at us through the wall and I'm asking @hamza_somali "what we having for Dinner brother?".'

Abu Hamza often uses his private Twitter account to share photographs of his food, which ranges from large pots of Indonesian noodles to hearty Russian stews.

He has revealed a great deal of personal information about himself on social media, telling followers that his family originally come from Lahore in Pakistan, he is 5ft 5in tall, and that his mother was incredibly anxious when he first went to Syria, adding that he prayed God would 'calm her heart'.

Abu Hamza later wrote on Twitter that the Somali fighter was his 'closest brother since I've been in jihad. Done everything together. May Allah grant us shahada together too.'

Cat lover: Named 'Anbar', after Iraq's largest province, the wispy ginger and white stray cat was adored by Abu Hamza, who posted photographs of her sleeping next to a box of bullets

Roots: Recently asked whether he missed anything about London, Abu Hamza replied: 'Miss all the different food and family.' The unmarried fighter also revealed he wanted 'two or three' children

Despite his apparently light-hearted approach to social media, the 21-year-old maintains a solid belief in the extremist values that define the Islamic State terror group 

An avid social media user, 'Hungry Hamza' is a keen fan of Instagram - promoting his account as offering 'a real insight into what the mujahideen of the IS get up to.'

Whilst Abu Hamza enjoys showing off photos of his food, it is his cat that has attracted most of the attention to his social media accounts. 

Named 'Anbar', after Iraq's largest province, the wispy ginger and white stray was adored by Abu Hamza, who called her 'my princess' and posted photographs of her sleeping next to a box of bullets while terrorists around her load their guns.

He described the cat as 'crazy' and 'a big problem' - explaining that she was 'up all night running around and when she does sleep she only wants to sleep right on top of you.'

The fighter's emotional attachment to his cat, proved a roblem when he had to leave her behind to go fight for the terrorists group on the frontline. 

A devastated Abu Hamza posted a final photo of Anbar, saying: 'I will be leaving my princess today. She's still small but I've had her since she was a baby...I know it's gna [sic] be hard to leave her.'

Abu Hamza has revealed that he has lived in both ISIS' Syrian stronghold of Raqqa and the Iraqi city of Mosul.

When asked to compare the cities, Abu Hamza said: 'Raqqa is very social it has everything you need. A bit too much dunya [multiculturalism] for me. Mosul is beautiful. It's more for the quiet.... kind of family.'

Despite his apparently light-hearted approach to social media, the 21-year-old maintains a solid belief in the extremist values  that define the Islamic State terror group.

He insists he and his fellow fighters are 'blessed with better homes than the White House and 10 Downing Street combined' and encourages young women to join him in the Islamic State, telling them that it is safe for them to travel alone.

The militant has also told how ISIS fighters play pranks on one another when they're not fighting, recalling an occasion when one terrorist put washing up liquid in a bottle of mouthwash.

'You can imagine what happened next. I'm still coughing bubbles,' he said.
