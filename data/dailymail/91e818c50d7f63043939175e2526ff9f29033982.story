The Huntsman family may be looking to craft themselves into the next American political dynasty, after the Kennedys, Bushes and Clintons.

Former Republican presidential candidate Jon Huntsman's 28-year-old pundit daughter Abby shied away from questions about a political future, but says she has not ruled out running for office.

'Never say never, right?' Huntsman told the Salt Lake Tribune on December 31. 'My dad has always raised us to serve. You've seen that with my brothers going in the military. … If there was an opportunity that made sense somewhere, where I felt like I had the right message to move it in the right direction and to help out, of course you take that seriously.'

Huntsman first came to public attention in 2011, when her father stepped down as President Obama's ambassador to China to start his own run at the White House.

Abby and two of her sisters were their father's secret weapon in the campaign, tweeting candid thoughts about the candidate, which made him more relatable. 

However, Huntsman's popularity never went over 5 per cent and he lost the GOP nomination to Mitt Romney.

Abby is currently a co-host on MSNBC show The Cycle, where she offers a more Republican perspective on the liberal network show. 

If she were to run for office, Abby says it would probably be back in her home state of Utah.

However, her more moderate Republicanism could prove difficult in securing public office in the conservative state. 

Abby believes that politics in the state are changing and cites former Democratic Gov Scott Matheson and former Democratic Utah congressman Jim Matheson as examples of the right-leaning state, sometimes voting for candidates on the left.  

'Utah has also changed a lot. You look at even Salt Lake City — the demographics are changing. I think we'll see in years to come that it's not going to necessarily be a hot spot for the tea party.' 

So far during her tenure on The Cycle, Abby has been the only panelist with a conservative point of view, but she finds herself agreeing with her co-hosts on a lot of issues. Abby adds that she considers herself a free thinker and never wanted to be another party talking head.

She says the 'next generation of young Republications' is 'more like Republicans of probably 20 years ago. Socially, we aren't where the tea party is at all. We are a lot more compassionate when it comes to gay rights and immigration, because we've grown up in a different world.'  

While he may be biased, her father has given her a glowing review of her journalist integrity, telling the Tribune: 'She's not an advocacy journalist, which is what you see a lot of today. She's an old-school journalist. She wants to get the story right, wants to convey to the listening audience the passion, the emotion, the politics of the moment without the proverbial political spin.'

But it still may be a bit early to be starting an political-action committees for young Abby, who says right now she's just 'trying to get the best that I can at what I'm doing'.
