When video editor Marina Schifrin decided she wanted to leave Taiwanese animator Next Media Animation, she probably didn't expect that her boss would fire back with his own video.

In a tongue-in-cheek video response uploaded to YouTube, employees at the Taiwanese animation company performed their own 'interpretive dance' to Kanye West's 'Gone.'

Her boss also had some stern words for her: ' I wish marina would have applied more creativity to her daily work as she did in the video.'

Scroll down for video....

Getting their own back: Marina Shifrin's former company have made their own version of the video that states what a great place to work the company is

Another brunette with glasses: There are parallels between the new video and the one that was posted six days ago

Showoff: But do they employees have time to enjoy it?

The bosses latest video wishes Shifrin well and announces they are hiring.

The
 clip even shows off the company's rooftop pool in an attempt to entice 
potential employees into applying for Marina's recently vacated position.

Fun place to work: The video shows how wild, wacky and crazy the workers are

Best wishes: The video wished Marina all the best, although her boss has complained that she wasn't as creative in her work as she was in the video she posted online

Job opening: Marina Shifrin's departure means that there is now a vacancy with the company

The
 video makes several referenced to the original and apart from being 
filmed in the same locations in the office, shows off the facilities to 
try and set the record straight.

Her boss has also made it clear that he did not find her video funny.

'I
 dont agree with everything that she said. She said we dont provide a 
lunch break, but this is Neihu, Taiwan, not New York City. Most people 
order takeout  and eat at their desks.'

Dead of night: The video begins with Miss Schifrin setting up a camera in her company's office at 4.30am

Dancing time: It then cuts to a shot of her dancing to the music of Kanye West's hit Gone

Backhanded compliment: Miss Schifrin says her boss is a 'brilliant writer' and her 'respect for him is boundless'

Just days earlier, Ms Shifrin penned a 1,500-word blog outlining her reasons for her resignation, which she called Journalism is Dead (To Me).

She wrote: 'I work for an awesome company that produces news videos.

'For almost two years I've sacrificed my time, energy and relationships for this job, and my boss only cares about quantity and how many views each video gets. 

Gripe: Tactfully she never names the company for which she worked but pulls few punches in her reasons for wanting out

Blogged down: And as if the video were not enough, she also penned a 1,500-word blog outlining her reasons, which she called Journalism is Dead (To Me)

'So I thought I'd make one of my own to focus on the content instead of worry about the views.

'Oh, and to let my boss know I quit.'

On her blog, Miss Schifrin, who is from New York, explains further: 'I got a job [...] for an animation company where I was free to make jokes and put my personality into my writing. I loved it! I found the perfect combination between comedy and journalism. I was having my cake, eating it AND going in for seconds.

'I dropped everything for work. I spent hours in the office perfecting my headlines, my voice overs, my stories.

Ironic? Since posting it online two days ago, her video has had more than 300,000 views

'I'm gone': The video ends with her switching off the light and leaving the office

'But as the workload increased, I found I could no longer keep up. I tried. I came in earlier, I stayed later, I worked on weekends. Scared I wasn’t pulling my weight, I went to my boss and told him how I felt.

'"Make deadlines, not art," was his response.

'After I admitted that I could not hit the deadlines needed to put out our long-form, satirical news pieces, I was moved to our serious stories.'

But she says she didn't find that fulfilling and decided to leave for a different career.

She adds: 'Running away from something is never the solution. Unless your problem is a mugger. Then yes, run. GO! NOW!

'But for this particular problem, the solution is rolling up your sleeves, sticking your hands in the motherboard and jostling the wires until things fall into place.'
