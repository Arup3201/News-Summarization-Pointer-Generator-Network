Hedge-fund owner Alan Howard has made what is thought to be the biggest single donation to help children in state education

One of Britain’s richest men has given £5million for state school pupils to be taught by teachers from private schools.

Hedge-fund owner Alan Howard has made what is thought to be the biggest single donation to help children in state education.

The money will be used to offer subjects including classics or Russian more often found in private schools.

It will also allow lessons from some of the country's best-known institutions to beam lessons into classrooms in state schools.

Mr Howard, estimated to be worth £1.6billion, has given the money to the United Learning Partnership Fund.

Private schools involved in the scheme include St Paul's School, attended by Chancellor George Osborne and Marlborough College, the old school of the Duchess of Cambridge.

Others signed up include RGS Guildford, James Allen's Girls School, Manchester Grammar School and Bolton School.

They will work mostly-urban academy schools which are already sponsored by United Learning.

Mr Howard, a co-founder of the Brevan Howard hedge fund, said: ‘Students deserve the best, especially when it comes to education.

‘I am very pleased to support a visionary team of educators who have developed an innovative approach to encouraging students to aim high while providing them the tools to achieve their goals.

‘The team is committed to do what it takes to make this project a great success and I am honoured to be backing their efforts.’

The fund will focus on distance learning, allowing specialist teachers from private schools to pass on their expertise using technology.

There will also be opportunities for pupils from state and private schools to attend cultural and sporting events together.

Clusters of schools will also be offered help to improve access to top universities, including residential events for the most able students to prepare their university application.

Jon Coles, the charity’s chief executive said: ‘We are indebted to the generosity of Alan Howard for his remarkable gift to us which will benefit teachers and students from across our schools and academies and far beyond.

‘This is an opportunity to do something unique in UK schools and provide training for staff across the board and give young people the advantages of exceptional enrichment experiences.’

Fiona Boulton, headmistress of Guildford High School said: ‘This funding demonstrates a multi-million commitment to assisting staff and children at all types of school from benefitting from shared training, development and pupil experience. We are delighted to be part of this.

‘The benefits of such a partnership work both ways. Being part of a group of both independent schools and academies, we already learn and share so much with our colleagues. To have a greater opportunity to do so, and with other schools, is wonderful.’
