Lebanese Army soldiers have arrested a suspected Australian terrorist among a group of ten alleged Syrian jihadis in raids in northern Lebanon on Monday.

The Australian, man, about whom little is yet known, was rounded up with six Syrians in northern Lebanese region of Koura, which lies along the Mediterranean sea around 60km from the Syrian border.

The Lebanese military rounded up four Syrians in Beirut’s densely-populated neighborhood of Tariq al-Jadideh on suspicion of having links to jihadi, an Army statement said.

'An Army force raided early morning  a certain location in Al-Tariq al-Jadideh in Beirut during which it arrested four Syrian nationals, on suspicion of having links to terrorist groups and for residing in Lebanon without legal papers,' the statement said.

It added that six Lebanese and an Australian national were also detained Monday in the district of Koura, in north Lebanon, on suspicion of terror links. 

Around 150 Australians and dual nationals are estimated to be fighting overseas, many of them in Syria, making Australia the highest foreign per-capita contributor to the conflicts.

The 11 arrests in northern Lebanon  were part of a security dragnet targeting wanted militants.

Security sources told The Daily Star that dozens of Syrians were being rounded up regularly as part of security measures aimed at clamping down on terror suspects and their clandestine entry into Lebanon.

Tightened security measures have been in order since June, when a suicide bomber killed at least one person at an army checkpoint on the road from Beirut to the Syrian capital, Damascus. 

Lebanese security forces were deployed  in raids on two Beirut hotels, and arrested 15 people.

In raids over the last few months, several suspects have been detained following search and seizure warrants filed by Interpol or by Syrian authorities, in line with a treaty for the exchange of criminals signed between Lebanon and Syria, the sources said.

Some of the detainees were illegal immigrants, but others were wanted in Syria and had escaped into Lebanon.

Lebanese authorities will try to establish  whether or not sending the detainees back to Syria would put their lives in danger.

It is unclear whether the Australian arrested in Lebanon with four Syrians had  entered the country from Syria.

A Sydney court hearing last week of alleged Australian jihadi recruiter, Hamdi Alqudsi, revealed at least six men had taken gone to fight with extremist forces in Syria, taking a route from the north via the Turkish capital, Istanbul.
