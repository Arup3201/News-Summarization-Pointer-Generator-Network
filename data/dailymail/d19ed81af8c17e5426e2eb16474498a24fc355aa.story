The French city of Grenoble has become the first in Europe to ban all commercial street advertising and will replace the content with trees and community noticeboards. 

From January to April next year, 326 advertising signs, including 64 billboards, will be taken down and the city's outdoor advertising contract will be cancelled.

In place of the hoardings, 'about 50 young trees will be planted before spring', the office of mayor Eric Piolle said.

According to The Local the office said: 'The municipality is taking the choice of freeing public space in Grenoble from advertising to develop areas for public expression. 

Local cultural and social groups will be offered free advertising space from January. But the new signs will be smaler 

Starting in January, officials will offer local cultural and social groups free advertising space. 

Lucille Lheureux, deputy in charge of public spaces for the city, said the new signs will be smaller and aimed 'not only at drivers, but also pedestrians'.

There is a dispute over how much the cancelling of the old advertising contract and subsequent greening of the city streets will cost. 

The mayor's office said the city used to earn around £470,000 a year through street advertising, but that was expected to plummet to €150,000 in the new year due the wider slump in advertising rates.
