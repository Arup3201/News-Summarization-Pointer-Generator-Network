Mauricio Pochettino’s Tottenham have seldom made life easy for themselves this season - and Thursday night was another case in point.

They enjoyed plenty of first-half chances and dominated possession throughout against Besiktas in the Ataturk Stadium but couldn’t put their Turkish hosts away.

Even a quarter-hour stoppage following a power cut, which plunged the stadium into darkness, couldn’t stem the flow of regular Tottenham attacks and Roberto Soldado, as so often, was the chief culprit, missing two very presentable chances. Nacer Chadli also had a goal chalked off for offside.

Then, the inevitable sucker punch. Michel Vorm hadn’t been tested too often but could do little as Cenk Tosun scored from close range to ensure Besiktas leapfrogged Spurs to finish top of Group C.

As Pochettino said afterwards: ‘I’m disappointed because we dominated, but in football you need to score when you create chances and dominate. We had clear chances but we were unlucky in front of goal.

‘One minute in the second-half changed the game and it’s true, we dominated, but we needed to score. It’s disappointing because we deserved more.’

It’s hard to argue with Pochettino’s assessment but as thoughts drift towards Monday’s last 32 draw, he’ll be privately annoyed his team failed to get the job done.

The moral of so many European campaigns is that it’s a good idea to finish top of your group. The equation really is simple. Finish top and you’re one of the seeded clubs - one of the predators rather than the prey.

You only have to look at Arsenal in the Champions League to see the benefits of leading the way. Last season, they finished second to Borussia Dortmund in their group and were subsequently eliminated by Bayern Munich.

The year before, they trailed Schalke and the same fate befall them. Bayern went on to win the competition. In 2010-11, they were bested in the group by Shakhtar Donetsk - and promptly ousted by Barcelona.

A little extra perspiration in the group stage can often lead to greater glories further along the line.

For Tottenham, it means they could be paired on Monday with the likes of Inter Milan, Napoli, Borussia Monchengladbach, Athletic Bilbao or Zenit St Petersburg, rather than Aalborg, Guingamp or Young Boys.

That first quintet is, of course, a worst case scenario but Spurs won’t get a great deal of change out of any of the seeds.

There’s a sense of inevitability that Spurs will be drawn alongside Zenit in Nyon on Monday and come face-to-face with their former manager Andre Villas-Boas.

This is not the tortured soul seen at Spurs or Chelsea either. Villas-Boas’s Zenit may not have advanced in the Champions League but they currently enjoy a seven-point lead in the Russian table.

And a late winter trek to St Petersburg is never an attractive proposition, for fans, players or managers.

Other possible long-haul trips include Dinamo Moscow and Dynamo Kiev, though you would fancy Spurs to overcome them.

Inter Milan have been familiar foes for Spurs in recent years and while being drawn against the Italian giants may conjure up happy memories of Gareth Bale’s San Siro hat-trick and that two-legged Europa League win, it’s not one they’ll relish.

Nor Napoli, who put out Swansea last season, Fiorentina, Bilbao or Sporting Lisbon, who have dropped down from Chelsea’s Champions League group. Olympiacos gave Manchester United an almighty fright last year, while Legia Warsaw is about as hostile as it gets in Europe.

Go through Tottenham’s potential opponents one-by-one and you soon realise that danger lurks everywhere. The Europa League has certainly gained in strength.

In many ways, the unseeded portion of the draw isn’t a lot better. But while Spurs could have landed Villarreal, Celtic, Roma, Sevilla or Ajax, they could just as easily pulled out a side with very little European experience like Guingamp or Aalborg.

Their fate now rests in the hands of the drawmaster on Monday but Pochettino may live to regret his team not holding out for that draw to top the table in Istanbul.
