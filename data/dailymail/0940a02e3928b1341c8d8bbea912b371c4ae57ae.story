Gunman Peter Reeve killed himself yesterday on his mother’s grave with the same weapon he used to murder a policeman.

The 64-year-old shot himself in the head with a revolver while sitting on his family’s plot in the graveyard of a picturesque village.

His death ended a desperate manhunt involving dozens of armed police officers following the murder of their colleague, PC Ian Dibell.

Last night it emerged that Reeve was a violent, paranoid and gun-obsessed outcast prone to angry rants.

The retired bus mechanic, who suffered from a heart condition, was furious with the noise made by a couple living below his flat and warned friends he would soon ‘kill someone’.

Macabre end: A white forensics tent has been erected among the gravestones in All Saints Church graveyard in Writtle, Essex, where the body of gunman Peter Reeve was found this morning

Vital evidence: A box thought to contain the murder weapon is removed from the scene at the church

Probe continues: Reeve's body was found alongside a weapon in the grounds of All Saints Church

He accused the couple of ‘printing money’
and of being ‘involved in drugs’. His threat became reality when he 
stormed out of his home ‘firing wildly’ at Trevor Marshall, 48, and his 
Polish girlfriend on Monday afternoon.

They escaped into the street, but Mr Dibell was killed as he ran from his home to help after hearing the first shots.

A friend of Mr Marshall’s stepdaughter Melanie Jacobs said Mr Dibell’s 
actions had saved their lives. He said: ‘Our thoughts go out to the 
officer and his  family.

'It was a very brave thing that he did. He 
didn’t have to do it. If it wasn’t for him, Trevor might not be alive 
today.’

Reeve was found dead on the grave of his mother Gladys, who died in 
1985, at All Saints Church in Writtle – 40 miles from the shooting in 
Clacton-on-Sea, Essex.

His brother Terence, who died in 2004, is also 
buried there.

Builders working on scaffolding overlooking the churchyard said they 
heard a shot at 8.30am before seeing his body slumped across a 
gravestone.

Neighbours and friends yesterday gave a disturbing insight into Reeve’s lifestyle.

Medical response: Paramedics have been assisting the police with their investigation in Writtle yesterday

It emerged he had been visiting a local gun club for more than five 
years.

Members of the Little Clacton Gun Club said he was known for his 
strident views on ‘homosexuals, blacks, bankers and unmarried mothers’.

They described him as a ‘sad and ineffective man’ who had become 
mentally unstable and recently threatened to kill someone.

One man said Reeve, who was not a member and did not shoot, had 
attempted suicide twice this year and insisted he was being followed by 
‘druggies’.

Questions remain: Police cordon off the area surrounding All Saints Church as detectives revealed Reeve used a handgun to kill Pc Dibell and did not have a firearms licence

'Strong connection to village': Rumours have been circulating that one of Reeve's relatives may have been buried in the churchyard where he was found dead

Puzzle: Police revealed that Reeve had possessed a shotgun licence in the past, but this would not have allowed him to own the handgun he used to murder Pc Dibell

A former neighbour,  John Molley, said: ‘The best thing he did was put a
bullet in his head. One day my son kicked his ball under his car and he
came out like a maniac and made my boy cry.

'When I went to speak to 
him, he would not come out of his house.

‘He kept a shotgun in his house but I would not let him come shooting with me – he was too dangerous. He was scary.

‘He used to beat his wife. She used to come out of the house with tears in her eyes.’

It emerged that police told Reeve’s ex-wife to leave her Chelmsford home
for her own safety as he roamed the county on Monday night.

Susan Wood,
who left Reeve ten years ago, spent the night at the home of her 
daughter Michelle.

On guard: Police at the scene outside the church in Writtle. It is believed Reeve had a 'strong connection' to the village

The Police Federation of England and Wales identified the dead man as PC Ian Dibell

Neighbours said Mr Marshall, who escaped with a minor leg injury, was a 
driver for Fresh Linen Laundry and had moved to the block of flats about
six months ago.

Stuart Griggs, 40, who saw the shooting from his window, said Reeve had 
seemed to be a ‘perfectly normal bloke’.

He added: ‘A couple of months 
ago he started becoming very paranoid about the couple who had moved in 
downstairs. He came up to me a few times and said: “I think they’re 
printing money.”

‘Next thing he said he thought drugs were involved.

'I explained to him 
that the guy downstairs works as a lorry driver and that is why he comes
home at odd times of the night, but he wouldn’t let it go.’

Essex Police said Reeve did not hold any gun permits. Detectives 
insisted a ‘live murder inquiry’ would continue despite his death and 
said Reeve had no significant criminal past.

In a statement, Mr Dibell’s family said: ‘We take some comfort from his 
bravery. Ian selflessly went to the aid of people in desperate need, 
without fear or thought for his own safety.

‘It was who he was – a hero. He has paid for the act in the most devastating way. He will be deeply missed.’
