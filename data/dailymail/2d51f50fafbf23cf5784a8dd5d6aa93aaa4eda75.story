Paralysed by war, Mostar, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, entered 2013 without a budget to fund a soup kitchen, pay for firefighters or heat a school. 

Yet despite still being crippled by conflict, these photos show the country's southern town is slowly beginning to repair. 

Mostar was the most heavily bombed of any Bosnian city during the 1992-1995 war following the break-up of Yugoslavia.

It lost many of its important buildings and structures through the air strikes. 

The old city was completely destroyed including the destruction of Mostar's architectural and spiritual heart, The Old bridge, known as the Stari Most. 

The bridge has now been rebuilt, re-opening in 2004, and visitors will notice the restoration of many more of the war-torn city's buildings.

But two decades on and the country is divided more than ever as bitter memories live on.

The conflict centred on whether Bosnia should stay in the Yugoslav Federation, or whether it should become independent. 

It is now an independent state but under international administration. 

Its three main ethnic groups are Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims), Croats and Serbs.

The war left Bosnia's infrastructure and economy in tatters and around two million people were displaced.

Some 100,000 people died and two million people were forced from their homes during ethnic cleansing.

Slow intervention eventually brought peace, but at the cost of ethnic segregation dividing the country between Serbs, Croats and Muslims. 

And there are still visible signs of Mostar's troubled history.

Bosnia has absorbed some 9 billion euros in foreign aid to help it heal from the war, yet Mostar, a town of 70,000 people, has resisted reconciliation.

Each side still has its own electricity provider, phone network, postal service, utility services and university.

Croat and Bosniak schoolchildren attend separate classes, studying from different textbooks.

The
latest row over how to reform the electoral code is rooted in a fear by
Bosniaks, who are the minority in Mostar, that they will be dominated 
by the Croats.

The Bosniaks want safeguards to make sure they are not out-voted. The Croats, in the majority, want the town unified.

'In
a few months Mostar will be just 25 miles from the EU, and we should be
heading towards modern Europe and not back to the Middle Ages,' said 
Sladjan Bevanda, a local Croat political leader, told Reuters.
