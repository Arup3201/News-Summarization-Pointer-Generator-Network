A 20-year-old Lousiana mother confessed to police Tuesday to killing her ill 17-month-old son by injecting his feeding tube with Germ-X brand hand sanitizer.

Erika Wigstrom told police she did it to 'end his suffering,' after the boy was born with Down's syndrome and a serious heart defect.

The boy's father Cesar Ruiz, 20, is already behind bars after a similar attempt to kill the baby in October 2012 in which rum was injected into his feeding tube, causing him seizures and brain damage.

In her interview with police March 11, 
Wigstrom revealed it was actually she who was behind the first attempt 
at killing little Lucas Ruiz and she'd used perfume, not rum.

Confessed: Erika Wigstrom, 20, told police Tuesday that she killed her 17-onth-old son who suffered from Down's syndrome and heart defects by injecting his feeding tube with Germ-X brand hand sanitizer

It's happened before: Lucas Ruiz, left, died from acute alcohol intoxication in January. It was the second time he'd been poisoned with alcohol. The first time, he was just 2 months old and his father Cesar Ruiz, right, confessed he did it to ease the infant's pain. He claimed he didn't mean to kill or hurt Lucas.

One-year-old Lucas died back on January 24 from acute alcohol intoxication, reports the Times-Picayune.

That's when police were called to a home in Belle Chasse, where they found the child 'breathless and pulseless.'

He was rushed to a hospital in New Orleans, where he was pronounced dead on arrival.

An autopsy was performed and found the boy's blood alcohol level to be 0.280.

'The legal limit in Louisiana is .08 so that would mean almost four and a half times the legal limit,' Plaquemines Parish Sheriff's Office Cmdr. Eric Becnel told WVUE.

The autopsy results were revealed earlier this month and police then interviewed Wigstrom on Tuesday.

She reportedly told them she'd injected 
Lucas feeding tube with the alcohol-heavy hand sanitizer, but that he 
didn't die until a day later.

The story changes: After police determined that Lucas had been murdered, the interviewed Wigstrom. After confessing to killing her son to 'end his suffering,' she told police she'd been the one who tried it in 2012, not Ruiz. She also revealed she'd given the boy perfume in an attempt to kill him, not rum

Putting on an act? Wigstrom's confession may come as a surprise to anyone who saw a local news segment shot in spring of 2013 when she called out Lucas's father for harming their child and described the heartache she felt as he suffered seizures in her arms

Four times the legal limit: Lucas had a hole in his heart and was in and out of the hospital. He also reportedly had three holes in his heart. His BAC at the time of death was .280

On top of the horrific suffering Lucas must have endured in the hours before his death, he'd already suffered seizures and brain damage after rum was dumped into his feeding tube as he lay in the hospital in October 2012 undergoing treatment for his heart defect.

Wigstrom told police on Tuesday that she'd caused that, too.

Lucas's father had confessed to the poisoning at the time and said he'd done it, not to kill him, but to ease his suffering.

At peace: Lucas suffered seizures and brain damage after the 2012 attempt on his life. He also survived for a day before dying from the hand sanitizer poisoning early this year. He died January 24

He remained behind bars just as Wigstrom was admitting to police it had been her all along.

'From what I gathered from the detectives, they basically said she had no remorse,' said Cmdr. Becnel.

But the young mother was singing a far different tune while Lucas was still in her care.

Just last April, Wigstrom told WWLTV of the trauma she endured as Lucas suffered from the rum poisoning and of how it caused a rift between her and the baby's father.

'That baby had a seizure in that hospital bed with me and all the nurses and the ICU doctors standing around his bed, for 58 minutes. I talked to that baby the entire time, trying to get him to come back to me,' she said last year.

'Right now, I have no relationship with him. I do not desire a relationship with him. I will never have a relationship with him,' Wigstrom said.

Cesar Ruiz was charged with second-degree cruelty to a juvenile, but it remained unclear just after Wigstrom's arrest whether he'd still stand trial.

Wigstrom, however, will stand trial. And at a bond hearing Wednesday, she broke down in tears as her charge was read: first degree murder.

'With the evidence and the age of the child, we believe we have a strong case,' Becnel said.

He also marveled in disbelief at the case.

'It's a tragic situation. I don't know what goes through someone's head, to harm a 17-month-old. I have a 19-month-old myself, and I couldn't put it in my system to do something like that,' he said.

No bond was set for Wigstrom. She faces life in prison if convicted.
