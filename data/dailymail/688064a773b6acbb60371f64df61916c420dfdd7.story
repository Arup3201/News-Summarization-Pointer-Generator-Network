Real Madrid star Sergio Ramos admits he has played under some 'fantastic' coaches during his career but hinted that Jose Mourinho wasn't one of them.

The pair fell out during the Portuguese manager's reign in the Spanish capital, with Ramos unimpressed with the way Mourinho treated certain members of the squad.

The feud has continued despite the pair being apart for over a year now, and Ramos was keen to explain some of the ways that Real had benefited from a change of coach.

Ramos said that Carlo Ancelotti understood how to manage the complexities of a large dressing room

'Of course a dressing room can get very complicated when it includes people from very different cultures, languages and countries,' Ramos told FIFA.com. 'When there’s such a mix of everything you have to know how to handle it very well. (Carlo) Ancelotti is very important in this.

'He notices how a player settles in, whether he makes an effort to open up to his team-mates or not. He’s a coach who takes you aside, talks to you and makes everything as smooth as possible, both on a professional and personal level.

'That’s the key to success, which is why he’s a truly great coach. In my view, he’s one of the two best I’ve had in my whole career.'

When asked who the other coach was, Ramos said: 'Wow, that’s a hard one. There’s (former national team boss) Luis Aragones, then you have (former Sevilla manager) Joaquin Caparros, who really believed in me when I was a nobody. I have had some fantastic coaches and Ancelotti’s definitely in the top three.'
