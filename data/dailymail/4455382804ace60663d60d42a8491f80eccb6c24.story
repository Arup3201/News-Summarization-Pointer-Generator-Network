The journalist credited with being the first to to report the shooting dead of Argentinian prosecutor Alberto Nisman has vanished.

Damian Pachter, of the English-language Buenos Aires Herald, reported on Friday he was followed by unknown people and feared for his safety but did not elaborate, his employer said. 

Mr Nisman was found dead last Sunday, the day before he was to testify before congress about his explosive allegations that President Cristina Kirchner shielded Iranian officials wanted in the South American country's biggest terrorist attack.

The official in charge of investigating his death said last night that he appeared to have been shot at point blank range but added that there was no firm evidence that anyone else was involved.

Missing: Damian Pachter told his employer on Friday he was followed by unknown people and feared for his safety

Argentine President Cristina Kirchner (left) has claimed that prosecutor Alberto Nisman (right), who died a day before he was due to accuse her of covering up a Jewish bombing in 1994, was murdered to 'implicate' her

The local journalism group he worked for, Foro de Periodismo Argentino said he left the country yesterday. Calls and emails to Mr Pachter on Saturday were not immediately returned.

In a statement, Pachter's employer said the journalist had not expressed his concerns to the newspaper and the organisation was ready to help him in any way possible. 

Earlier this week, President  Kirchner claimed Mr Nisman was murdered to implicate her.

Kirchner argued that Alberto Nisman did not commit suicide, but was instead killed in an 'operation' against her government.

Mr Nisman, the lead prosecutor in the case, was found dead under suspicious circumstance with a gunshot to his head at his home.

Prosecutor Viviana Fein, who is leading the investigation into his death, said yesterday that the shot had been fired 'from a distance no greater than a centimetre'.

She added that ballistics analysis will be needed to determine whether or not the bullet taken from Mr Nisman's body matches the gun found at the scene.

 The day after his death, he was to go before a congressional hearing to accuse President Kirchner of shielding Iranian officials implicated in the 1994 attack on a Jewish community centre which left dozens dead.

Investigators have said Mr Nisman appeared to have committed suicide, but have not ruled out homicide or an 'induced suicide'.

In a stunning post on her Facebook page, President Kirchner contended that Mr Nisman was killed to immerse her government in scandal after he had been 'used' to publicly accuse her of involvement in the cover-up.

'I'm convinced that it was not suicide,' she said.

'Prosecutor Nisman's charges were never in themselves the true operation against the government.

'They collapsed early on. Nisman did not know it and probably never knew it.

'The true operation against the government was the prosecutor's death after accusing the president, her foreign minister, and the secretary-general of (her political faction) of covering up for the Iranians accused in the AMIA attack,' she added.

President Kirchner offered no evidence to support her theory and did not say who she thought was behind Nisman's death.

Before his death, Mr Nisman had filed a 280-page complaint charging that President Kirchner had issued an 'express directive' to shield a group of Iranian suspects in the bombing.

Mr Nisman contended that the government had agreed to swap grain for oil with Tehran in exchange for withdrawing 'red notices' to Interpol seeking the arrests of the former and current Iranian officials accused in the case.

The attack on the Buenos Aires headquarters of the Argentine Jewish Mutual Association, or AMIA, was the deadliest terror strike in Argentina's history.

Eighty-four people were killed and more than 300 injured when a van loaded with explosives was detonated in front of the building.

Since 2006, Argentine courts have demanded the extradition of eight Iranians, including former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, former defense minister Ahmad Vahidi and Iran's former cultural attache in Buenos Aires, Mohsen Rabbani, over the bombing.

But in 2013, President Kirchner signed a memorandum of understanding with Tehran agreeing to set up a 'truth commission' to investigate the bombing and allowing Argentine prosecutors to question the suspects in Iran.

The rapprochement was vehemently opposed at the time by Jewish community leaders, who charged it was 'unconstitutional'.

In general, Argentina has a free press, with many organisations reporting on government officials and corruption in ways unimaginable in many Latin American countries.
