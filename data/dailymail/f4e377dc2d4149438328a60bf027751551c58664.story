The ready-meal revolution helped busy working parents put food on the table without too much time, fuss or breaking the bank.

However, the conventions of austerity Britain have been turned on their head with a new take on the once humble fish pie – and it costs an eye-watering £314.16.

The meal for two is made by the Charlie Bigham’s company, which is best known for supplying posh ready meals to the likes of Ocado, Waitrose and Sainsbury’s.

Charlie Bigham holds his new 'Swish Pie', the world's most expensive ready meal priced at £314.15, containing a range of luxurious ingredients, including vintage champagne and lobster

Wild turbot combines with white Alba truffles to create a dish that maker Charlie Bigham describes as 'the very pinnacle of gourmet cuisine'

However, this special creation, with a crumb top including 24 carat gold, will only be available for a limited period from its own website and kitchens from today.

Quite apart from the gold in the crumb topping, there is sea salt harvested from the Piran Salt Pans and white Alba truffles with hidden aphrodisiac qualities.

It includes Balik Salmon, carefully selected from the shores of the Barents Sea, and fresh wild Turbot, which have been extravagantly poached in vintage Dom Perignon champagne. 

The ingredients also include a selection of delicious diver caught salted Oysters and fresh lobster from the Cornish coast.

For a final flourish, the gourmet creation is topped with an amuse-bouche of Beluga Caviar, which is served on two mother of pearl spoons.

To guarantee the safe arrival of the £314.16 ready meal for two, each dish will be delivered in a bespoke aluminium case, which is handcuffed to a professional security guard.

Mr Bigham, who set up his business 17 years ago in west London, said: ‘We always set out to create the very best versions of people’s favourite dishes.

'We wanted to take our reputation for making the finest ready meals that bit further and create something truly extraordinary for our customers to enjoy. 

‘I’ve always been obsessed with quality ingredients, provenance and unique and delicious flavours.

‘I’ve spent months scouring the globe for the most exclusive ingredients while developing this unique recipe to ensure that it really is the most exceptional ready meal out there.’
