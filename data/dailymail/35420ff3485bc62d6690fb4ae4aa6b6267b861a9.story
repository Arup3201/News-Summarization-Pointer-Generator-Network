Wanted: Qasim Majid, 30, is a suspect in the 2004 murder of Tyrone Clarke

A man was able to walk into a UK consulate in Pakistan and pick up his new passport - despite being wanted for the murder.

Qasim Majid, 30, is a suspect in the 2004 gang murder of Tyrone Clarke, who was stabbed five times and beaten with an iron bar on the streets of Beeston, Leeds.

The suspect, who is wanted for questioning by West Yorkshire Police over the violent killing, had no problems applying for the document under his own name. He was spotted in Dina, Pakistan, after he featured in an episode of Crimewatch.

It was sent to a consulate by officials from the British Embassy in Hong Kong, where he was able to collect it.

Checks were made, but there was no record of his being a wanted man, according to the Sun on Sunday.

It later emerged that there was never an international arrest warrant issued for him, and that his details were left out of Government databases.

However, police and the Crown Prosecution Service are now attempting to obtain permission to seek his arrest overseas.

A spokesman for the Passport Office said: ‘We rely on law enforcement agencies to advise us of any information that would prevent an individual from being entitled to a passport.’

Tyrone’s mother Lorraine Fraser, was said to be devastated at the missed opportunity to catch the suspected killer.

Her son was killed by a group of as many as 30 Asian youths armed with baseballs bats, poles and planks.

The mixed-raced youth was chased through the streets of Beeston before being stabbed to death.

Four members of the gang were given life sentences in 2005, though a hearing at Leeds Crown Court decided that the attack was ‘not racially motivated’.

Anjum Amin, Islamur Rahman, Kamer Akram, and Liaquat Ali, all from Beeston, were told they could apply for parole after 9 to 12 years.
