A woman in Scotland has become so attached to the ewe she raised in her daughter's playhouse that she washes and blow-dries the animal's coat every day and feeds her Kit Kats and Jaffa Cakes.

Ellen Henderson, 55, from Thurso, Caithness instantly fell in love with Princess Neptune when the lamb was born on April 14, 2012.

She has since treated the ewe like a member of the family, allowing her to sleep in her daughter's playhouse and eat at the table at dinner time.

Ellen Henderson allows her pet ewe Princess to sit at the dinner table and eat biscuits

Mrs Henderson said: 'I am absolutely addicted to her - she is part of the family.

'It's a pantomime whenever we are with her.

'My husband pretends he doesn't care about Princess but I caught him a few times on his way home from work sneaking into the garden to give her a cuddle.

Princess has grown so big she has had to move to Mrs Henderson's mother's house in Skerray, Sutherland

'She can be an absolute diva when I am around to spoil her.'

The ewe, who was named after a Grand National winner, originally looked like she wouldn't make it through the night when she was born in April 2012, but Mrs Henderson nursed her back to health and has been devoted to her ever since.

The unusual house pet is doted on by her owner, who took turns hand-rearing Princess with her husband Dave for two months in their kitchen in Thurso.

Princess has a very sweet tooth and is particularly partial to Jaffa Cakes and Kit Kats

Mrs Henderson said she is a 'princess' in her eyes: 'Neptune was a bit masculine so we added the Princess but as far as I'm concerned she is a princess.'

She has now grown to such a healthy size that she is to big for the Hendersons' home and has had to move to Mrs Henderson's 89-year-old mother's croft in Skerray, Sutherland, but she still visits Princess every other day.

The greedy ewe has a very sweet tooth, which Mrs Henderson indulges by feeding her Kit Kats and Jaffa Cakes.

Princess is now living at Mrs Henderson's mother's house in Sutherland, but Mrs Henderson still visits every other day

Princess knows where the biscuit tin is and even steals the hen's food.

Mrs Henderson said: 'On one occasion two visitors came round for tea and I left the room for a moment to meet the postie and when I came back I could hear laughter from the porch where Princess Neptune had jumped onto the coffee table and started eating from the sugar bowl.'

'People think that sheep are stupid but they are really clever animals.

Princess nearly didn't make it when she was born in April 2012, but Mrs Henderson nursed her to health

'When my mother was poorly one day, Princess Neptune went into the house and climbed up the stairs where she started prodding my mum in her bed.

'She even cries when we return home after going to visit her - it's heartbreaking.'

When the Hendersons celebrated their 30th wedding anniversary recently, Ellen's only wish was for a portrait of Princess.

Princess was allowed to roam freely around the house - she even knew where the biscuit tin was

She said: 'David asked me what I wanted as a present for our anniversary, especially as 30 years is such an important milestone.

'I didn't want a pearl necklace or a diamond ring- all I wanted was a painting of my beloved Princess.

'It really is my favourite possession - it is priceless. The artist has really captured her special look.'

The painting, by local artist Angela Simpson, is now proudly displayed in their living room, so Mrs Henderson can look at Princess's picture, even when she is not with her.
