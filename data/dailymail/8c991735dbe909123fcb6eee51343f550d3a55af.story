A wartime bunker used by Winston Churchill to watch his troops prepare for the D-Day landings has been listed by English Heritage.

The British Prime Minister was joined by Supreme Allied commander Dwight D. Eisenhower and King George VI at the observation point on the eve of the historic invasion of Europe.

Fort Henry is today looked after by the National Trust and has been given a Grade Two listing in recognition of its historical significance.

Nearby Second World War beach defences including gun emplacements, pill boxes, and concrete anti-tank 'pimples' have also been listed for protection.

It is the first time the fort overlooking Studland Bay, in Dorset, has been listed for its historical importance.

English Heritage listed the building because of its historical associations, design and good state of preservation.

Six weeks before D-Day in 1944, Studland Bay was the scene of the largest live ammunition practice of the entire war.

Thousands of troops took part in Exercise, or Operation, Smash, a full-scale rehearsal for the invasion of occupied Europe.

The bay was considered a possible target for a German invasion and was heavily fortified from 1940 onwards.

In April 1944 the fort was used by King George VI, Churchill, General Eisenhower along with General Bernard Montgomery and Acting Admiral Louis Mountbatten to watch the exercise.

From the bunker, which offers outstanding views over the bay, the VIPs watched a demonstration of carpet bombing followed by an assault landing by troops.

The use of live ammunition in a rehearsal run was not regular practice, but military leaders wanted it to be as realistic as possible for the soldiers.

Built in 1943, Fort Henry was a specially constructed concrete bunker and observation post.

It was 90ft long with walls, floor and ceiling all three feet thick, and was considered a safe place for the VIPs to witness the rehearsal of the Normandy landings.

These days visitors can go inside the bunker and look through the same observation slit the men used to view the training exercise.

An English Heritage spokesman said: 'Fort Henry provides an impression of the scale and significance of the preparations for D-Day and is associated with the most prominent figures of the Allied forces.

'Studland Bay is known for its beaches and wildlife but it is great that its role in the Second World War has now been recognised.'

Fort Henry was built by Canadian Royal Engineers, who named it after their home base in Ontario.

Together with other surviving defences, the bunker forms part of the Studland Beach Second World War walk.
