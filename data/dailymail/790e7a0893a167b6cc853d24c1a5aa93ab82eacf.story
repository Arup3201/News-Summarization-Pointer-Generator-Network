The site of Wounded Knee where U.S. troops killed up to 300 Native American men, women and children in 1890 is up for sale - sparking fury among the descendants of the victims.

The land in South Dakota is on the market for $3.9 million (about £2.5 million).

One of the country's poorest Native American tribes wants to buy the historically significant piece of land where their ancestors were killed, but tribal leaders say the price tag for a property appraised at less than $7,000 is just too much.

Land owner James Czywczynski is trying to sell a 40-acre fraction of the Wounded Knee National Historic Landmark on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation to the Oglala Sioux Tribe.

Anger: The Wounded Knee Massacre site and mass grave -the site where U.S. troops killed up to 300 Native American men, women and children in 1890 is up for sale

Up for sale: The 40-acre property in South Dakota is on the market for $3.9 million (about £2.5 million)

Sale: James Czywczynski, 74, is trying to sell a 40-acre fraction of the landmark for $3.9 million to the Oglala Sioux Tribe. But leaders on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation say the asking price for a property appraised at less than $7,000 is just too much

The land sits adjacent to a 
gravesite where about 150 of the 300 Lakota men, women and children 
killed by the 7th Cavalry in 1890 are buried.

Czywczynski, whose family has owned 
the property since 1968, recently gave the tribe an ultimatum: purchase 
the land for $3.9 million or he will open up bidding to non-Native 
Americans.

He said he has been trying to sell the land to the tribe for years.

Scene: This is the site where a battle was fought between the US Army and Sioux Indians. After the battle ended, there were approximately 300 dead Sioux and 25 dead soldiers

Killed: The 7th Cavalry overwhelmed the Lakota warriors and began shooting haphazardly killing men, women and children of the Lakota Sioux - they also wounded at least 51

Price: Land owner James Czywczynski insists the site's historical significance adds value

The ultimatum comes right before the 
tribe is poised to receive about $20 million from the Cobell lawsuit— a 
$3.4 billion settlement stemming from a class-action lawsuit filed over 
American Indian land royalties mismanaged by the government for more 
than a century.

'I think it's ridiculous that he's 
putting a price on it like that,' said Kevin Yellow Bird Steele, a 
tribal council representative from the Wounded Knee district, who thinks
Czywczynski is putting pressure on the tribe because of the impending 
money.

'We need to come down to earth and be realistic. We're not rich. We're not a rich tribe.'

Czywczynski insists the site's historical significance adds value.

'You can’t put a price on the lives 
that were taken there,' said Garfield Steele, a tribal council 
representative for the Wounded Knee district, reported the New York Times. 

The last major 
bloodshed of the American Indian wars occurred on 
December 29 when the U.S. troops went into the camp to disarm the men.

According to the US version of the 
story, a deaf tribesman named Black Coyote resisted attempts to disarm 
him that morning and in the struggle a shot was fired.

U.S. troops then opened fire in 
response and a small number of Lakota fighters who still had guns fired back.

Past: A picture of Wounded Knee on 28 Mar 1973. It was the site of a violent clash in 1973 between a group of native activists, the American Indian Movement and US Marshals

Massacre: U.S. Military authorities awarded twenty troopers the Medial of Honor for the massacre

Frozen: 'Big Foot,' the leader of the Sioux tribe, lies frozen on the battlefield of Wounded Knee, South Dakota

The 7th Cavalry overwhelmed the Lakota warriors and began shooting haphazardly killing men, women and 
children of the Lakota Sioux  - they also wounded at least 51.

U.S. Military authorities awarded twenty troopers the Medial of Honor for the massacre.

Along with its proximity to the 
burial grounds, the land includes the site of a former trading post 
burned down during the 1973 Wounded Knee uprising, in which hundreds of 
American Indian Movement protesters occupied the town built at the site 
of the 1890 massacre.

The
71-day standoff that left two tribal members dead and a federal agent 
seriously wounded is credited with raising awareness about Native 
American struggles and giving rise to a wider protest movement that 
lasted the rest of the decade.

Remembrance: Members of the American Indian Movement stand near the Wounded Knee Massacre Monument last month to mark the 40th anniversary of the start of the 71-day occupation

Respect: American Indians on the Big Foot Memorial Ride arrive at Porcupine, S.D n 2007 to remember the 1890 Wounded Knee massacre

Gathering: A crowd gathers to mark the 30th anniversary of the American Indian Movement standoff near the gravesite at Wounded Knee, S.D

Czywczynski, who also is trying to sell another 40-acre piece of nearby land to the tribe for $1 million, also noted a coalition of Sioux tribes raised $9 million in December to buy land about 100 miles away in the Black Hills — although the Oglala Sioux Tribe did not contribute to that effort.

'I'm getting older now and my family and myself want to dispose of this property,' said Czywczynski, 75, who now lives in Rapid City.

'We just want to see it in the hands of the Indian people rather than put it on the open market to the public.'

Craig Dillon, a tribal council member on the Land Committee, said he would like to see the tribe buy the land at Wounded Knee because then they could build a museum commemorating the massacre with artifacts, food vendors and a place for local artists to sell their art to visitors.

'But with the price the way it is, I don't think the tribe could ever buy it,' Dillon said.
