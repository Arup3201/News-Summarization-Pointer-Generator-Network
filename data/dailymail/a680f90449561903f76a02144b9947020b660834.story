Alexis Sanchez propelled Arsenal to victory against Stoke in the Premier League on Sunday with another outstanding display. Here, Sportsmail's Sami Mokbel details how every player performed.  

ARSENAL (4-2-3-1) 

DAVID OSPINA – 6.5

Had very little to do on his first Premier League start, but dealt with everything competently.

Davis Ospina had a quiet afternoon between the sticks replacing Wojciech Szczesny in the Arsenal goal

MATHIEU DEBUCHY – 6

Facing another spell on the sidelines, this time with a shoulder injury after collision with Arnautovic.

PER MERTESACKER – 6.5 

Looks so much more comfortable with Laurent Koscielny next to him. More like his old self. 

LAURENT KOSCIELNY – 7

 Arsenal look a safer outfit with him in the side. Excellent header for the opener.

NACHO MONREAL – 7.5

Battled on after taking a blow to the head in collision with Crouch. A comfortable display. 

FRANCIS COQUELIN – 6.5

Doesn't have the quality to make the holding midfield position his own but more than did a job.

TOMAS ROSICKY – 7

Great to watch on this form. Intelligent and disciplined performance from the Czech midfiedler. 

Tomas Rosicky (second right) is denied a goal by a good save from Stoke goalkeeper Asmir Begovic

ALEX OXLADE-CHAMBERLAIN – 7

The England man was dangerous throughout and kept fulfilled his defensive duties. 

SANTI CAZORLA – 7

Was the victim of some rough treatment by Stoke but kept coming back for more. 

ALEXIS SANCHEZ – 9

What more can you say? They signed him for £30million. What's he worth now? 

Alexis Sanchez was in sensational form throughout Arsenal's win over Stoke, and found the net twice

OLIVIER GIROUD – 7

Kept Stoke's back-four occupied with his physical presence on his return from suspension.

SUBSTITUTES 

HECTOR BELLERIN - 6.5 (on for Debuchy 12) 

Slotted in comfortably at right-back.

THEO WALCOTT - 6 (on for Oxlade-Chamberlain 67)

Missed a great chance, but valuable minutes.

MESUT OZIL - 6 (on for Giroud 73) 

Massive boost for Arsenal to have the German back. 6.

ARSENE WENGER – 7

Will be more than satisfied with the way his side stood up to Stoke's physical approach. 

STOKE (4-2-3-1)

ASMIR BEGOVIC – 5 

A miserable afternoon for the keeper summed up by Sanchez's free kick that crept passed him. 

RYAN SHAWCROSS – 5.5

 Imposing physically but couldn't deal with Arsenal's clever movement in front of him.

PHILIPP WOLLSCHEID – 5

Welcome to the Premier League. Has just arrived in England from Germany – will be wondering why. 

Defender Philipp Wollscheid (right) endured a difficult afternoon against Arsenal on his Stoke debut

ERIK PIETERS – 4

Chased shadows as Arsenal went for the jugular. Hauled off at half-time. 

STEVEN N'ZONZI – 5

Would have fancied his chances against Coquelin and Rosicky. It didn't turn out that way. 

GEOFF CAMERON - 5

Had a torrid afternoon trying to deal with the movement of Arsenal's attacking quartet. 

GLENN WHELAN – 5

Huffed and puffed bought couldn't stem the flow of Arsenal's attacks.

JON WALTERS – 5

Grafted as you would expect, but had minimal impact in the attacking quarter. 

BOJAN KRKIC – 5.5

Some nice touches but not the former Barcelona forward's best day.

MARKO ARNAUTOVIC – 5

Horrific nudge on Debuchy led to his injury. Little impact on the game apart from that. 

PETER CROUCH – 5

Typically physical display but Mertesacker kept his impact down to a minimum.

SUBSTITUTES 

MARK MUNIESA - 5 (on for Pieters 46) – Couldn't halt Arsenal's momentum. 

STEVE SIDWELL - 5.5 (on for N'Zonzi 46) – Brought on to keep things tight in midfield. It didn't really work. 

STEPHEN IREAND - 5 (on for Bojan 73) – Came on when the game was already over. 

MARK HUGHES – His attempts to ruffle Arsenal with an physical approach failed miserably. 5
