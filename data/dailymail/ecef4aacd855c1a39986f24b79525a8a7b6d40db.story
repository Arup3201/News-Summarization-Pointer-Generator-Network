Most drinkers call it a night when they've run out of cigarettes.

But not wine connoisseurs, who carry on drinking regardless, it seems.

A new study has found that making cigarettes more expensive and banning smoking indoors means people drink less beer and spirits – but not wine. 

Smoking laws which made cigarettes more expensive and banned smoking in public places meant people drank less beer and spirits - but not wine

Researchers found that when the price of tobacco rose by 20 per cent - and smoking was forbidden in public places - the amount of beer and spirits consumed fell.

But banning smoking had no effect on the amount of wine people knocked back.

As part of the new study, researchers analysed the price of cigarettes from 1980 to 2009 in each state in the U.S. and the 'smoke free air' policies which might have banned smoking indoors.

They also looked at how much beer, wine and spirits were drunk per person in each U.S. state.

The figures showed beer consumption fell by four per cent and spirit drinking by 11 per cent when these two measures to try and prevent people from smoking so much were introduced. 

Study co-author, Melissa Krauss, of Washington University School of Medicine, said: 'In situations when smokers are drinking alcohol, it tends to trigger cravings for a cigarette.

'Some people even tend to smoke only when they drink, but not at any other time.' 

She added that these results were across the whole population, whereas if they looked just at smokers then it is likely they would see even more of a reduction in the amount of beer and spirits people drank.

In the short term, those who want to cut down on their drinking could achieve this by smoking less,  she said.

The reason why there was no noticeable decrease among wine drinkers may be because they are more educated, more likely to have other healthier lifestyle habits - and are less likely to smoke, the researchers explained.

Richard A. Grucza, associate professor of psychiatry at the university, said raising taxes on cigarettes could be explored as a way of reducing the amount of alcohol drunk. 

'Excluding tobacco, alcohol is by far the deadliest drug in the U.S.,' he added. 

People prefer wine are more educated, more likely to have other healthier lifestyle habits - and are less likely to smoke, researchers claim

'Raising taxes on alcohol would go a long way toward reducing excessive alcohol consumption, but there has been a lot of resistance to doing this. 

'Our study shows that strengthening tobacco-control policies might be another way to accomplish this. 

'By raising cigarette taxes and strengthening clean indoor air laws, states may not only reduce health detriments related to smoking, but also those related to drinking.' 

The researchers say the findings could spark further studies on whether restrictions on cigarettes could reduce alcohol-related violence, drunk driving, and health problems and even deaths related to alcohol.

The study was published in the journal Alcoholism: Clinical & Experimental Research. 

It follows research which found that fewer people smoked in states with tighter smoking regulations.
