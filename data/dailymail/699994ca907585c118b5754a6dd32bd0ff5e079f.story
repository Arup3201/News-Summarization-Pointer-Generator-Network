The owners of the Miss World pageant have announced that there will be no swimsuit round in next year's competition.

In an interview with Elle, chairwoman Julia Morley explained: 'I really... don't need to see women just walking up and down in bikinis. It doesn't do anything for the woman. And it doesn't do anything for any of us.'

She added: 'I don't care if someone has a bottom two inches bigger than someone else's. We are really not looking at her bottom. We are really listening to her speak.'

Miss World, which was founded in 1951 by Mrs Morley's late husband Eric, started as a contest dedicated exclusively to swimwear called the Festival Bikini Contest.

But recently, she has come to feel that the swimsuit round is archaic and unnecessary.

As such, the pageant has elected not to broadcast the bikini portion of the show in recent years, judging the girls privately in front of a small panel instead.

But as of 2015, they plan to do away with the swimsuit round altogether. 'We don't want to just make them feel like they are walking bodies, you know?' explained Mrs Morley.

Mrs Morley, who is in her seventies, also revealed that she is hoping to set her competition apart from other pageants by emphasizing brains and personality over physical beauty.

One step was the creation of Beauty with a Purpose, the service element of the competition which she started in 1974.

In order to win this part of the event, the contestant must be judged as having done the most relevant and important charity project in her nation.

This year's  Miss World winner, Rolene Strauss of South America, was crowned last weekend, and it's clear to see why she best represents what the competition stands for.

The 22-year-old is a fourth year medical student and science is clearly in her blood.

Her parents are a doctor and nurse, and in a pre-taped interview for the pageant, Rolene said that becoming Miss South Africa and Miss World and studying medicine were her 'childhood dreams'.

'Everyone in my town called me Little Dr Strauss,' she said. 'Because I was always the little curly-headed girl running around behind my dad in the hospital.

'I'm a test tube baby and I believe my passion for health was born with me,' she added.

As well as being a medical student, Rolene is bilingual and speaks fluent English, as well as Afrikaans.

Paying tribute to her country after being crowned, she said: 'South Africa this is for you. I think I will brace myself for what's about to happen. It's a huge responsibility.'

By eliminating the swimsuit round, Mrs Morley says she hopes to distinguish her pageant from those like the Donald Trump-owned Miss Universe, which places a large emphasis on the bikini contest.

In fact, following the death of her husband in 2000, Mr Trump apparently called Mrs Morley to ask if she was 'ready to throw in the towel'.

His comments prompted her to take out a $5million loan in order to bolster the company. 'They are not little girls,' she said of her contestants.

'This is what I want to get away from. This sort of "cute" image. No offense to Mr. Trump.'
