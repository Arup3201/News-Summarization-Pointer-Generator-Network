An eight-year-old girl has died after falling around 10 metres from a spinning ride at the Royal Adelaide Show.

Ambulance crews treated the girl at the scene before rushing her to the Women's and Children's Hospital, but sadly she died a short time later.

Police were seen gathered around a brightly coloured ride called 'Air Maxx 360' at the show, after the accident at around 12.30 on Friday.

The girl reportedly came out of her seat high in the air and 'landed extremely far away'.

'She was bleeding everywhere,' she told AAP.

'She didn't look too good. Everyone who saw the accident was in shock.'

Witness Malinda Dunwoodie, 17, told the Adelaide Advertiser the girl's safety harness was still down but it looked as if she slipped out of her seat.

'She was hanging by her legs off the ride, trying to block herself. She went flying through the air about 10-15 metres up in the air and I started sprinting towards her,' she said.

'I was shaking so much, she looked like a doll flying through the air.

'It was so shocking. It was like a horror movie.'

Eyewitness said the eight-year-old landed a long way from the ride

A spokesperson for the Royal Agricultural & Horticultural Society said: 'The ride, Air Maxx 360, was a new ride for the Royal Adelaide Show this year.

'However, it operated at both the Sydney Royal Easter Show, and the Brisbane show only a few weeks ago without incident.

'All rides at the show must pass a national compliance audit prior to the show opening and undergo daily checks by operators.

'This will be the subject of a thorough investigation and our heartfelt condolences are with the family.'

In 2000, 37 people were injured when the Spin Dragon ride collapsed in sideshow alley at the annual show.
