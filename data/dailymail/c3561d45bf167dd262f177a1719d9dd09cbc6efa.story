With a guest list ranging from the Prime Minister’s wife to a Strictly Come Dancing star, it was certainly an illustrious event.

But for once, it wasn’t the famous faces who were in the spotlight.

Instead, mother-of-four Shelley Gilbert became the centre of attention yesterday – as she was named the overall winner of the Daily Mail’s sixth annual Inspirational Women of the Year Awards.

Although typically in the spotlight, celebrities like Olivia Inge took a back seat as Inspiration Woman of the Year Shelley Gilbert became the centre of attention yesterday

Mrs Gilbert was joined at Downing Street by the four other finalists in the awards, held in association with Sanctuary Spa and the charity Wellbeing of Women.

Pam Marshall, 43, from Southampton, was put forward by her close friend Jean Rice for opening two holiday homes for seriously ill children and their families, while Andrea Fox, 52, set up The Drop Inn, a youth centre near her home in Belper, Derbyshire, to tackle anti-social behaviour.

Justine Laymond, 39, from Essex, has raised more than £15,000 for charity since having a life-saving double lung transplant.

And mother-of-two Clare Dimmer, 57, from Portsmouth, is the founder of Breast Cancer UK.

She set up the charity after contracting the disease when she was 38.

All of the finalists were selected from hundreds of extraordinary women nominated by the Daily Mail’s readers.
