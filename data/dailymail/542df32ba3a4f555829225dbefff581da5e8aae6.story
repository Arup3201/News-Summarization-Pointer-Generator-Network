A widow who faked her husband's will to cut his daughters out of their share of his £1million estate has been jailed for 21 months - despite falling pregnant at the age of 47.

Legal secretary Dawn Smith drew up the bogus document in her office two years before the death of her wealthy 61-year-old husband, Harvey.

In her phony document, she made her and her son sole beneficiaries of the fortune - leaving her late husband's two daughters distraught and confused as to why they had been cut out. 

Jailed: Pregnant widow Dawn Smith was sentenced to 21 months behind bars for faking her husband's will to cut his daughters out of his £1million estate

She has since married again - to a waiter in the Turkish resort of Marmaris - and is now working as a bailiff for a debt company.

Smith has left debts against her late husband's name by not settling the £3,600 bill for his funeral, police revealed.

She also sold family heirlooms destined for Mr Smith's daughters to fund her trips to Turkey. 

It emerged she has visited Turkey almost once a month between the death of Mr Smith and her first court appearance in February. 

At Teeside Crown Court, Judge John Walford told Smith, of Carmel Road North, Darlington, a suspended sentence was not suitable.

He said: 'If I had only you and your unborn child to consider, I might have been able to consider that option, but in my judgement to do anything other than pass an immediate custodial sentence would be an affront to your step-daughters who you so cruelly deceived by your actions.'

Smith admitted drawing up the false will before his death, forging his signature and those of witnesses. She falsely swore an oath that the document was legal.

Judge Walford sentenced her to 21 months, saying: 'I am conscious this will be your first custodial sentence and I cannot ignore the fact that you are pregnant but there will be a sentence of some length to mark the seriousness of this offending.'

Earlier in the sentencing exercise, he questioned the timing of her falling pregnant. It was understood she was 18 weeks pregnant, dating back to her last visit to Turkey, a source said.

The judge said: 'There must be a suspicion, to put it no higher, that she has deliberately become pregnant in order to gain an advantage in the sentencing process.'

Caroline Goodwin, defending, told him: 'It came as a complete and utter shock to her.'

She also read out her client's statement of apology telling the court: 'I can never undo the wrong and how do I say I am sorry when words alone are not enough?' 

It is understood that her unborn baby is fathered by her new husband, a Turkish waiter, who was not present in court.

Miss Goodwin said the pregnancy was also a surprise to her partner.

The court heard how Mr Smith's family found it very hard to accept that his widow had remarried so soon after his death.

Describing the full ordeal, Mr Smith's daughter Karen Harwood, 43, said: 'I've not even grieved for his death yet as this has been so upsetting.

'It is hard not knowing what my dad's final wishes were. She took that away.'

In a victim impact statement read out in open court, she added: 'After dad died, I welcomed Dawn Smith into our family and took her to see my daughter Alice in a play, four days before she was arrested.

'Because of her actions, it made me think, what have I done to make Dad think this of me? 

'It made me think why my dad would turn his back on his daughter and his grandchildren for a woman he had known less than a quarter of my life.' 

Miss Harwood also spoke of how the family had spent £20,000 in court costs trying to contest the will and to clear Mr Smith's name of debt. 

Astonishingly, as Mr Smith's spouse, she is still entitled to his £490,000 pension, despite her deceit.

Her father Harvey Smith, who owned an engineering firm, was given an MBE for services to industry in 1986.

Smith faked the signatures of her husband, another legal secretary and a solicitor on the bogus document she drew up in 2010.

After his death in November 2012, she told his family she didn't believe he had a last will and testament.

But she later produced the paperwork - back-dated to February 2011 - which left their £500,000 house in Darlington and £420,000 pension to her.

It excluded Karen and included explicit instructions that her sister Zoe, 25, should not receive anything at all.

Her deception was uncovered when a partner at the Darlington law firm of Hewitts, where Smith had worked, thought it suspicious the women were overlooked while Dawn Smith's son was included.

Moving on: Smith has since remarried to a Turkish waiter, pictured together, who works in the resort of Marmaris. She sold her late husband's family heirlooms in order to pay for trips to Turkey after his death

The lawyer - a personal friend of Mr Smith - raised concerns and staff spotted basic errors.

One of the supposed witnesses had left the firm at the time they were said to have signed it, and the other had changed offices.

Police were alerted and a handwriting expert concluded that Mr Smith's signature was not the same as legitimate ones provided by detectives.
