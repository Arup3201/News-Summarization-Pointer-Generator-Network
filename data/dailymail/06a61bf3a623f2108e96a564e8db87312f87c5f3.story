'Naive': The shamed former IMF head Dominique Strauss-Kahn claims he did not know the girls at orgies were being pimped in an organised vice gang

Dominique Strauss-Kahn is a ‘simple swinger’ who had no idea the girls at orgies he attended were being paid to have sex with him, his lawyer said yesterday.

The shamed former IMF chief has committed nothing more than a ‘crime of lust’, Paris barrister Richard Malka claimed.

He was speaking after the 62-year-old economist was charged in France with ‘complicity in pimping in an organised vice gang’, which carries a maximum prison sentence of 20 years.

Strauss-Kahn is acccused of knowingly using prostitutes paid for by two businessmen who were illegally using company funds to organise sex parties in Europe and America.

The charges come as a judge in New York will decide today whether the man once tipped to be the next French president should face civil action from a hotel chambermaid over attempted rape allegations, or whether he can claim diplomatic immunity from the charges.

In the French case, at least five prostitutes told police they had sex with Strauss-Kahn. One told detectives she attended 11 orgies with him, adding: ‘I got the feeling he liked rough sex.’

But Mr Malka said he and his client would now do everything in their power to have the charges brought by two judges in Lille on Monday night dismissed.

The vice ring at the centre of these allegations reportedly operated out of the Carlton Hotel in Lille

He said: 'It is quite implausible and
contrary to common sense to use terms like "organised gang" and "vice 
network" to describe a simple swinging activity.

'Mr Strauss-Kahn is finding himself, in large part because of his fame, thrown to the wolves.

'Colossal
police and judicial means were deployed to crack and dissect his 
private life to an infinite degree, with the only goal being to invent 
and then castigate what can be considered a crime of lust.

'And what a strange co-incidence that all this should happen a month from a major national election.'

The vice ring under investigation operated out of the Carlton Hotel in Lille.

Strauss-Kahn
had been widely tipped to stand as the socialist candidate in next 
month’s presidential election, with polls showing he would easily beat 
right-wing rival Nicolas Sarkozy.

But
his political ambitions were wrecked when he was arrested for allegedly
trying to rape New York hotel chambermaid Nafissatou Diallo last May.

After
being held in New York’s notorious Ryker’s Island prison, criminal 
charges were dropped and he returned to France only to face similar 
accusations of sexually abusing a young French writer.

When
those allegations were also dropped, he was then confronted with more 
claims he used prostitutes supplied by the Lille vice network.

Strauss-Kahn
has confessed to attending orgies in France and Belgium, but claims he 
never knew the girls were hookers because ‘they were all naked at the 
time’.

His lawyer Henri 
Leclerc said earlier this year: 'At these parties, people were not 
dressed, and I defy you to tell the difference between a naked 
prostitute and any other naked woman.'

During
the vice network investigation, it emerged that Lille police chief 
Jean-Christophe Lagarde had organised an eight-person orgy for 
Strauss-Kahn at a luxury Paris hotel in 2010.

Lille
businessman David Roquet and three other men are also accused of 
providing hookers for Strauss-Kahn in a bid to curry favour with the man
then tipped to be the next French president.

In
further damaging claims, Roquet and Lagarde are also accused of flying 
prostitutes to New York for Strauss-Kahn for an orgy on May 13 last year
- the day before he was accused of trying to rape the chambermaid.

One
vice girl named Jade, 29, told cops how she was flown to the US to meet
Strauss-Kahn, and he even invited her to his office at the headquarters
of the IMF in Washington DC.

She added: 'I found him charming and polite. He was treated like the Messiah at orgies we went to.'

Women selling themselves for sex is not illegal in France, but pimping is.

Strauss-Kahn
is now formally under ‘judicial control’ on £85,000 bail until judges 
decide whether to send him to stand trial, which means he cannot leave 
France and has to report to police regularly.
