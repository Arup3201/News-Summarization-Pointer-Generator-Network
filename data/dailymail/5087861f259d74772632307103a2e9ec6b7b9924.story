Robin van Persie was given a pep talk by Holland manager Louis van Gaal after 'stomach problems' forced him to train away from the main squad on Tuesday.

After bagging a brace in his first two games, the Holland star striker has failed to find the net since as Van Gaal's side edged out Costa Rica in a dramatic penalty shootout to set up a semi-final showdown with Argentina.

The Manchester United striker trained away from the rest of the squad, with Van gaal confirming: 'He has some stomach problems, some intestinal problems, so it's best not to train him.'

After missing training, Van Persie is a doubt for Wednesday night's clash in Sao Paolo - but his manager expects him to retain his spot if fit.

The Old Trafford manager-in-waiting said: 'I will decide (on Wednesday).

'Van Persie is our captain so he is very important to us.

'In principle my captain always plays, but he has to be fit.'

Van Gaal took the frontman to one side for a quick pep talk during the session at the Paulo Machado de Carvalho Stadium in a bid to get him firing again.

The 30-year-old started the tournament with a bang, scoring twice against Spain including a diving header which is a candidate for goal of the tournament. He scored against Australia but picked up a second yellow card, ruling him out of the Netherlands' final group game against Chile.

Van Persie
 was substituted late on against Mexico in the last 16 and his 
replacement Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored the winner from the penalty spot 
in stoppage time as the Dutch battled back from a goal down.

In
 the quarter-final against Costa Rica, Van Persie missed a series of 
chances but scored the Netherlands' first penalty in a shootout victory 
that sealed their place in the semi-finals.

Van Persie should be expecting no favours from Turkish referee Cuneyt Cakir after the striker slammed the official's decision to send off Nani in a Champions League defeat to Real Madrid in 2013.

There was some good news for the Holland coach on Tuesday as injury doubts Ron Vlaar and Leroy Fer took part in training.

In
 an interesting development, midfielder Nigel de Jong was also involved 
even though he had been expected to miss the rest of the World Cup after
 suffering a groin injury in the group stage win over Mexico.

'If his reaction is good and he can play, then the miracle can come true,' Van Gaal said.

But even if De Jong makes a shock return to the XI for the Argentina match, it will mean nothing if Van Persie is ruled out.

Holland have relied heavily on the Manchester United striker, and fellow star Arjen Robben, in Brazil.Both players scored in the penalty shoot out win over Costa Rica which sent the Dutch through to their second successive World Cup semi-final.

That match was a draining affair as Holland battered the Costa Rica goal, but they could not beat Keylor Navas inside 120 minutes.

Van Gaal thinks his players will have recovered their fitness by the time they face Alejandro Sabella's team.

'In general I give the players two days to recover, so if you have one day less it's an issue, a problem," Van Gaal said. "But a top athlete can perform so my players will be in shape.'

Van Gaal's decision to bring on Tim Krul in the 120th minute of the quarter-final was hailed as a master stroke.

Krul saved two penalties after replacing Jasper Cillessen, but the Newcastle stopper will not start the semi-final.

'No. I ruled that out straight away,' said Van Gaal when asked if he would start with Krul.

'Jasper is doing a wonderful job, it was just that stopping a penalty is something that the others (Krul and third choice Michel Vorm) are better at.'

Although Argentina are yet to hit peak 
form in Brazil, they are the bookmakers' favourites for the match at the
 Arena Corinthians.

Van Gaal believes there is nothing between the two sides though.

'I don't think there is a favourite,' the Manchester United manager in waiting said.

'The countries are at the same level. It's a 50-50 match and we have to be a bit lucky too.'

Danger man: Holland are well aware of the threat posed by Argentina's  Lionel Messi

Key to Holland's chances of making the final will be how they deal with the threat posed by Lionel Messi, who has finally transferred his domestic form with Barcelona onto the international stage.

'He has been voted the world's best player before and you don't get that for nothing,' Van Gaal added. 'He has always found it hard to show his form at international level.

'He wants to do it at this tournament and we want to stop him.

'That will be a challenge.'
