Holidaymakers went through some tense moments on Monday morning when a Thomas Cook plane made an emergency landing after passengers say it began ‘creaking like mad’ due to a technical fault.

The pilot was forced to abort the four-hour journey to Dalaman, Turkey, and return to Manchester Airport shortly after the Boeing 767 took off around 7.15am.

A Thomas Cook spokesman said the plane, carrying 278 passengers, turned around as a precaution because it suffered an unexpected hydraulic fault on one of three systems on board.

One of the passengers, who tweets for the account for J Smith Joinery, a home improvement and maintenance firm in Bolton, wrote: ‘New this plane was FOOKED!! Took off, plane creaking like mad, got near London and the pilot announced "we need to turn around and return to Manchester DUE TO A TECHNICAL FAULT!" [sic]

The person then tweeted: ‘JESUS CHRIST!!! Just made emergency landing!!!’

Passenger Matthew Brierley tweeted: 'Slightly worried when fire brigade is waiting on runway for your plane to arrive!' 

Flight data reveal that the plane, which reportedly had a hydraulic problem, turned around in the skies near Northampton and  circled over Peak District National Park, southeast of Manchester, to burn off fuel.

The plane landed safely around 8.15am and was towed off the runway. The Thomas Cook spokesperson said that is normal procedure for such a fault. 

The spokesperson added: ‘We can confirm that flight TCX2534 from Manchester to Dalaman landed normally after a priority landing was requested by the captain.

‘We'd like to apologise to our customers for the delay to their flight today. Returning the aircraft to Manchester allowed our engineers to inspect the aircraft quickly and we've now been able to ensure our customers can start their holiday as soon as possible on a replacement aircraft.’
