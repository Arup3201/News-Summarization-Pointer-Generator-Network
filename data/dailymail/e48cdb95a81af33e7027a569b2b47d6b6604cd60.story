Rifleman Harry Brown's mother was told he was presumed dead when he was actually in a war camp

A heartbreaking tale of a soldier whose family were told he was presumed dead even though he was alive in a German prisoner of war camp has been revealed.

But sadly, even though rifleman Harry Brown survived to see the end of the war, he never made it home.

Just 16 days after the armistice was signed on November 11 in 1918, he had died of an inflammation of the lungs.

Harry, who served in the 2nd Kings Royal Rifle Corps regiment, set off for France in 1917.

His mother wrote to Harry on July 12, 1917 – but had her letter returned with the code ‘Missing 10-7-17’ written on the envelope.

She immediately wrote to the Red Cross asking for information and received a reply on July 30 promising that enquiries were being made.

But in August, she received a standard letter sent via the Red Cross to relatives of a number of soldiers who were missing and presumed killed in action after a battle at Nieuport les Bains on July 10, 1917. 

The letter, with Harry Brown’s name added in the right place, was sent to his mother on August 15 

But in fact, Harry had been captured not killed – and wrote to his mother from the German war camp in Linburg-on-Lahn reassuring Mrs Brown of his good health.

The postcard dated August 31, 1917, said: ‘Dear Mother, I am in good health and if you send to the address below, it will find me.’

He added: ‘Don’t worry about me as I have finished with the war.’

Harry was later moved to another camp in Bayreuth but even though he survived until the war had ended, he died on November 27 in 1919.

A letter sent to Mrs Brown, in Eastbourne, East Sussex, gave her the news that her son had died.

Simon Feldman, of the Royal Mail, said the postal service played a vital role in the war.

Mrs Brown was told her son was presumed dead, only to receive a postcard later to say he was 'in good health'

Harry wrote to his mother from the war camp in August 1917 to say he was 'finished with the war'

He said: ‘With letters being the only means of connecting loved ones, acting as a real lifeline during the conflict.

‘Through these letters and postcards we can see the terrible danger soldiers faced on the front line during the First World, as well as the anxiety, worry and grief felt by families left behind at home.

‘The correspondence to Harry Brown’s mother provides a sad insight into the moment all families would have dreaded; a letter to say her son was missing, presumed dead.

‘Mrs Brown’s later joy at receiving a postcard from her captured son would have sadly been short lived, as Harry died just 16 days after the Armistice was signed in 1918.’

In December 1914, a special sorting office – the Home Depot – was built to deal with mail sent to the troops.

In 1917, more than 19,000 mailbags crossed the channel each day with half a million bags conveyed in the run up to Christmas.
