Police have released the last known photographs of murdered prostitute Valmai Jane Birch, whose mutilated remains were found in 2011 in a wheelie bin in the bathroom of her home at Woonona, north of Wollongong, NSW.

Detectives have released the photographs in an appeal to the public for clues to the death of Ms Birch, whom neighbours heard screaming in the days before they reported a foul odour coming from her apartment.

Ms Birch, 34, had moved to the Housing NSW unit not long before her death and was reportedly trying to cover from a drug addiction which had led her into a life of prostitution.

Last photos: Police have received CCTV images of murdered woman Valmai Jane Birch captured by CCTV at Wollongong Railway station on the morning of March 2, 2011. Twelve days later, Ms Birch's mutilated remains were found dumped in a wheelie bin in her housing commission flat in Woonona, north of Wollongong NSW

Trying for a new life: Valmai Jane Birch (pictured) had not long moved into a flat in Woonona north of Wollongong in March 2011 to try and turn her life around, when the 33-year-old, whose drug addiction had forced her into prostitution, was found dead and dumped in a wheelie bin in her bathroom

At around 10pm on March 22, 2011, police from the Wollongong Local Area Command attended a unit block on Woods Avenue, Woonona, after residents reported a strong smell coming from the flat Ms Birch occupied.

Upon entering the premises, officers found the mutilated remains of a woman in a wheelie bin inside the flat's bathroom.

Forensic police said the body had been in the bin for several weeks and following the discovery of images of Ms Birch from CCTV cameras at Wollongong Railway Station, detectives have now been able to narrow down the time period in which she was murdered.

Screams heard: neighbours in the unit block where Valmai Jane Birch died reported hearing 'a murderous sound' coming from her flat in the days leading up to their reporting a foul odour and police finding her body in a wheelie bin inside the residence. Police have now released the last images of |Ms Birch (pictured) caught on CCTV at Wollongong Railway station on March 9, 2011

Collapsed on the street: Neighbours of the housing unit in Woods Avenue, Woonona (pictured) north of Woolongong where the mutilated remains of Valmai Jane Birch were found in March 2011, reported that she had collapsed on the street and noises were heard frequently coming from her flat

'We believe Ms Birch was murdered between Wednesday 9 March and Monday 22 March 2011,' said Detective Acting Inspector Gunn from the Homicide Squad.

Homicide Squad detectives and police from Wollongong Local Area Command, who formed Strike Force Gareth to investigate Ms Birch’s death, and are appealing for any clues or sightings of Ms Birch to help them solve her murder.

The CCTV images were taken on March 9,  2011.

'We’re particularly keen to hear from anyone who saw or spoke to Ms Birch during February or March 2011,' Inspector Gunn said.

'It doesn’t matter how small or insignificant the information may seem, it could help us crack this case and bring whoever is responsible for Ms Birch’s death to justice.

'Please remember, information can be provided anonymously and will be treated confidentially.'
