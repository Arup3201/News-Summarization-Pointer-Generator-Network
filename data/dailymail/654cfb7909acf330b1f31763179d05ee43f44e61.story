Survivors of the deadly bus crash along an icy Oregon highway is recounting the horror of the wreck that has claimed nine lives on Sunday.

Aboard the charter bus were 48 passengers, some of them exchange students from South Korea.

One of those students was Jaemin Seo, 23, who thought that he was the sole survivor after he
had been thrown out of the bus through a broken window.

Mr Seo told the Oregonian: 'Beside me was a body part. I thought she was already dead.'

Seo said he was awakened by screaming 
passengers and was ejected from a broken window as the bus careened down
the hill.

He suffered a broken ankle, a gash in his arm that required 
stitches and shallow scratches across his face.

In an interview with the Associated Press, Seo added: 'Some mothers screamed to find their son or daughter.'

Berlyn Sanderson, 22, of Surrey, 
British Columbia, said she and several other passengers were ejected.

'It's kind of like one of those dreams you have of the world ending,' 
she told The Associated Press.

Probe: Investigators will now examine how the bus left the road, the condition of the road at the time, the condition of the guardrail, as well as the actions of the driver

The Oregonian quoted one survivor, 25-year-old Yoo Byung Woo, as saying he and some other passengers thought the driver was 'going too fast.'

'I worried about the bus,' Yoo said, adding it was snowing and foggy at the time. He said one rider was frightened and asked if they could take another route.

Yoo said rocks smashed through windows after the bus crashed through the guard rail and rolled down. The NTSB said the bus rolled at least once.

Other passengers were from British Columbia, and some from Washington state.

Investigators say there also may have
been a Japanese passenger and one from Taiwan, and they're working with
consular officials from those nations to identify them.

The
survivors, who range in age from 7 to 74, were sent to 10 hospitals in 
Oregon, Washington and Idaho. At least 10 were released Monday, police 
said.

Some survivors were carried on backboards by six or eight rescuers. Others were hoisted in baskets, and an all-terrain vehicle arrived toward the end of the operation, Woodson said.

Officials said 39 people were taken to hospitals, and 10 of them had been treated and released.

The National Transportation Safety Board said two investigators were expected to arrive at the crash site Monday.

They will look into why the bus left the road, the condition of the road at the time, the condition of the guardrail, the actions of the driver, and the operations of the company that owns the bus, the agency said.

The bus, owned by a British Columbia 
company, was returning to Canada from Las Vegas, one of the stops on a 
nine-day western tour, when it crashed Sunday just east of Pendleton.

Meanwhile, authorities said on Monday that it may be a month or more before investigators and prosecutors decide whether to file charges in the crash.

At a news conference Monday, State Police Lt Gregg Hastings said investigators don't know how fast the bus was going, but there were icy spots on Interstate 84 through the Blue Mountains.

Hastings said the bus hit a concrete barrier, veered across both westbound lanes, went through a guardrail and plunged 200 feet down a bank.

Hastings said authorities are working with the South Korean consulate to identify victims.

The crash occurred near a spot on the interstate called Deadman Pass, at the top of a steep, seven-mile descent from the Blue Mountains.

That section of road is so notorious that state transportation officials published a warning for truck drivers saying it has 'some of the most changeable and severe weather conditions in the Northwest.'

Still, Oregon Department of Transportation spokesman Tom Strandberg said that while there were icy spots where the crash occurred, it was nothing unusual for this time of year.

He said a sanding truck had applied sand a few hours earlier and was behind the bus making another run when the crash occurred.

The sand truck driver was among the first at the scene.

The highway has been shut down several times this winter, mostly due to crashed trucks blocking the roadway, Strandberg said.

A decision to close the road or require chains is made by the local maintenance crew, he said.

Umatilla County Emergency Manager Jack Remillard said the bus was owned by Mi Joo travel in Vancouver, B.C.

A bus safety website run by the U.S. 
Department of Transportation said Mi Joo Tour & Travel has six 
buses, none of which have been involved in any accidents in at least the
past two years.

A spokesman for the NTSB, Peter 
Knudson, said seatbelts aren't required on such buses. 'We have been 
concerned about this for some time,' Knudson said.

I-84 is a major east-west highway through Oregon that follows the Columbia River Gorge.

Umatilla County Emergency Manager Jack Remillard said the bus was owned by Mi Joo travel in Vancouver, B.C.

A woman who answered the phone at a listing for the company confirmed with The Associated Press that it owned the bus and said it was on a tour of the Western U.S. She declined to give her name.

A bus safety website run by the U.S. Department of Transportation said Mi Joo Tour & Travel has six buses, none of which have been involved in any accidents in at least the past two years.
