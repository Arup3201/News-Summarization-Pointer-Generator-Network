Former Miss Bolton and one-time Miss England hopeful Kristina Long carried on driving after she hit David Robinson while over the limit

A beauty queen turned lawyer was jailed yesterday after she mowed down a man in a hit and run while driving home drunk.

Kristina Long, 26, was speeding in a 20mph zone after her work Christmas party when she hit a pedestrian.

But the former Miss Bolton, who was twice the legal limit, carried on her journey despite knowing she had crashed into something.

David Robinson, 53, was thrown almost 80ft forward and was left lying in the road with a fractured spine and leg until another motorist finally spotted him, a court  was told.

Yesterday, Long’s career as a lawyer lay in tatters as she pleaded guilty to dangerous driving causing serious injury, failing to stop at the scene of a collision and driving with excess alcohol.

Jailing her for 12 months, Judge Paul Lawton said cases like this required a message to be sent out about drink-driving over the Christmas period.

‘The tragic circumstances of this case are obvious to all concerned,’ he said.

‘But they are circumstances of your own making. You took a calculated risk to drive, having consumed a large amount of alcohol.’

Manchester Crown Court heard Long, who also won an award at the World Miss University contest in 2010 representing Northern Ireland, had been drinking wine and vodka at the party held by her law firm Keogh’s at Bolton’s Reebok Stadium.

Long was jailed for 12 months and disqualified from driving for two years at Manchester Crown Court after being found guilty of a series of driving offences

She had agreed to drive three friends 
into Manchester city centre at around midnight on December 15 last year 
after partying for more than four hours.

On
 the way back home, she entered the 20mph zone in Salford driving at 
more than 30mph, when one friend began vomiting in the passenger seat of
 her Vauxhall Corsa due to drink.

Distracted, Long collided with Mr 
Robinson, causing injuries which left him in hospital for almost a month
 and in a neck brace for longer.

Long won beauty pageant Miss Bolton and also represented Northern Ireland in a beauty pageant in South Korea before turning her attention to law, where she got a job at UK firm Keogh's

Long pleaded guilty to a series of driving offences and was jailed for a year, as well as being disqualified from driving for two years

But
 it was not until Long returned home and confessed to hitting something 
that a relative called police and officers found she had 45mg of alcohol
 on her breath almost two hours after the hit and run.

They estimated 
she was likely to be at 61mg at the time of the crash. The legal limit 
is 35mg. Her car was also severely damaged from the impact with Mr 
Robinson, a museum technician.

When
 footage of the incident was shown to Long, she said: ‘Oh  my God.’ 
Prosecutor Charlotte Crangle said: ‘CCTV shows there was no braking at 
all until after the impact.

'He hit the bonnet and was thrown up into the
 air  and propelled 24 metres forward before landing in the bus lane 
with  his feet facing towards the pavement.

'The defendant’s windscreen 
was smashed. Her average speed was about 36mph, according  to experts.’

Formerly
 a keen swimmer and runner, Mr Robinson had to move back in with his 
parents and still suffers health problems as a result of the collision.

Long, of Altrincham, Greater Manchester, was also disqualified from driving for two years.
