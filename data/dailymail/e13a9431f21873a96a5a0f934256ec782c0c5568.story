This is one new home where you are guaranteed not to have a problem with noisy neighbours - a converted 17th-century chapel, complete with graveyard.

Residents in St Dials, Cwmbran, South Wales, have dubbed the ghoulish property the 'tomb with a view' after it was put up for sale at just £8,000.

Planning permission has been granted to turn the historic building into a bijou one-bedroom home, complete with the graveyard where up to 50 people are buried.

The tomb with a view: This chapel in Cwmbran, South Wales, is to be turned into a one-bedroom home and is expected to fetch just £8,000 when it goes up at auction

Auctioneer Paul Fosh said: 'It will make someone a very cosy, solid little home

'And you wouldn't have to worry about any noise from the neighbours.'

.

Once packed to the rafters by Welsh Non-Conformists, the chapel hasn't been used for generations, and neighbours believe it to be haunted.

But to ensure the inhabitants of the graveyard are not forgotten, the tombstones will be laid flat face up so the engraved names can still be seen.

They will be covered by a special transparent layer to preserve them - but the new owner's cars can drive over them.

Ghostly: Neighbours say the chapel, which will come complete with gravestones, is haunted

The estate agent's blurb states: 'A detached chapel which is believed to date back to the 17th Century.

'The building is of stone construction under a pitch-tiled roof and we have been informed that it is not listed.

'It has planning for residential conversion - the site also offers potential for off road parking.'

The single-storey chapel has a guide price of £8,000 when it goes under the hammer at Paul Fosh Auctions in Newport later this month.
