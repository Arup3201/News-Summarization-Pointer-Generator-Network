Designer department store Harvey Nichols likes to push the boundaries when it comes to getting noticed.

Like many of its well-heeled clientele the luxury brand loves to show off about how fabulous it is and recent marketing activities have included a model wetting herself with excitement at the prospect of the shop's seasonal sale, a 'walk of shame', and beefy bulldogs being touted around in pricey handbags.

But it was the 2012 'love thyself' beauty campaign that really got Britain's knickers in a twist.

The Advertising Standards Authority has decided not to uphold complaints against Harvey Nichols for it 2012 'Love Thyself' campaign

The glossy images used to promote the store's new Liverpool beauty hall featured three glamorous models appearing to lean in to kiss themselves in a reflection.

A 'Love Thyself' strapline accompanied the headshots to reflect the narcissistic theme of the shoot.

A press release at the time of the launch said: 'These advertisements bring to life the promise at the heart of our Beauty Bazaar, Harvey Nichols store which is; after pampering and indulging yourself from head to toe across three floors of beauty, looking in the mirror will be a captivating experience and youâ€™ll fall in love with yourself all over again.'

But not everyone appreciated the self-loving sentiment.

The Advertising Standards Authority 
(ASA) received 17 complaints about the adverts: nine that the images were unsuitable to be
seen by children because they appeared to show a lesbian kiss, 10 that 
they were sexually explicit and two that the phrase 'love thyself' in 
combination with the pictures was offensive on religious grounds.

The ASA received 17 complaints about the adverts including nine that the images were unsuitable to be seen by children because they appeared to show a lesbian kiss

Harvey Nichols pointed out that the ads did not depict a lesbian kiss but rather a woman kissing herself and also argued that images of lesbians were not offensive or inappropriate and should be accepted by the ASA

On Wednesday the ASA decided not to uphold the complaints after the department store 
pointed out that the ads did not depict a lesbian kiss but rather a 
woman kissing herself, which was also made clear by the text.

But Harvey Nichols also argued that even though the adverts weren't intending to be sapphic images of lesbians were not offensive or inappropriate and should be accepted by the ASA.

Harvey Nichols said: 'The advertising
industry should be in the vanguard of those promoting and supporting 
the equalities espoused by anti-discrimination laws, including those 
concerning sexual orientation.'

The ASA said: 'We acknowledged that some
complainants had interpreted the posters differently and had understood
them to depict a lesbian kiss.

'One person also mentioned a young child 
who had not identified that the kiss was between one woman and her 
mirror image.

'Although we recognised that some people might have found what they 
perceived to be a portrayal of a lesbian kiss distasteful, we considered
that a reference to homosexuality in an ad would be unlikely in itself 
to cause widespread or serious offence or constitute irresponsible 
advertising.'
