Barbara Kirby, of Leesburg, (pictured) is accused of having sex with two minors

A 36-year-old Florida woman charged with having sex with a minor allegedly told the boy 'age is just a number'.

Barbara Kirby, of Leesburg, also threatened to kill the minor, who is aged between 12 and 15, if he told anyone of their encounter, according to an affidavit.

The boy told police Kirby had given him an intoxicating drink in her home before they had sex. 

He said that after having the drink on December 11, he felt dizzy and passed out. 

When he woke up, Kirby undressed and had sex with him, the New York Daily News reports.

She  allegedly then warned the victim, 'if you tell anyone about what we did, I will kill you.'

He went to police two days later.

An officer said that the boy admitted in interview he had been scared by Kirby's threats which is why he had not immediately gone to police or told anyone of the incident.

An affidavit said a second boy told a similar story in December about having sex with Kirby after being given the intoxicating drink. 

Kirby was arrested Tuesday after officers noticed her car during an unrelated call. 

She was charged with lewd battery  on a victim older than 12 but younger than 16 and tampering with a victim and is being held at Lake County Jail on $25,000 bail.

Kirby admitted to having sex with one of the boys but wouldn't answer any police questions about it.
