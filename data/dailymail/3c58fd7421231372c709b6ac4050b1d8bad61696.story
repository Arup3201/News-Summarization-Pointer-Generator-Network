Baby dolls have long been peeing 'like a real baby' since the 1930's but Toys "R" Us is now selling a doll with a realistic looking genitals--and it's upsetting some shoppers who think it's 'unnecessary.'

The toy is made by the company You & Me Change My Diaper Doll collection at Toys "R" US and it not only cries when it's wet, it pees from an anatomically correct penis.

The Huffington Post reports that some parents are outraged and think that the toy should at least come with a 'warning' label.

Others think that the doll's anatomy could be a learning experience for children and doesn't need to be perceived as sexual.

Monica Beyer, a writer at SheKnows.com, thinks the doll is an appropriate toy for children.

'How on earth is it inappropriate for a child to see a naked baby? What about a baby makes a penis or a vulva dirty or sexual?' Beyer writes.Â 

'The truth is, when a child points out the body part that she doesn't have, all a parent is required to do is call it by its name, ' she continues.

She goes on to talk about how 'body shame' starts early and needs to be 'stopped early.'

'The 
bottom line is that, while you may not choose to give your child an 
anatomically correct baby doll, parents should have the option. The doll
 isn't harmful,' she writes.

Peeing dolls have been around since the 1930s when Betsy Wetsy was invented by the Ideal Toy Company of New York.

While she may not have what is considered 'a vagina' she had a whole from which liquids pour out.

The
 first anatomically correct male doll was actually created in 1976 and 
is the Archie's Bunker's Grandson Joey Stivic doll which is still 
available for purchase on EBay.

The
 Huffington Post spoke to Dr. Logan Levkoff who suggested that having a 
doll with a penis might be helpful rather than harmful.

What's harmful is banning the word penis because then children might not know how to tell their parents a body part hurts.
