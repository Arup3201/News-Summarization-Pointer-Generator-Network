Attacks on Olympic gold medallist Rebecca Adlington for the way she looks have been condemned in Parliament.

Tanni Grey-Thompson, the Paralympian champion, said the swimmer’s tearful confession about her body image concerns on I’m A Celebrity last week served as a warning about the pressure women face.

And a government minister said the ordeal faced by Adlington was ‘enough to make me weep’.

Tissues and issues: Rebecca becomes teary and upset as she admits rival Amy Willerton makes her feel insecure about her body 

Adlington burst into tears taking part in the ITV reality show as she admitted her rival in the show, beauty queen Amy Willerton, made her feel insecure about her body.

The 24-year-old revealed she has struggled with abusive comments about her looks for years, saying: ‘It’s making me very, very  insecure that I have to look [a certain way].  For me, I was an athlete.

'I wasn’t trying to be a model, but pretty much every single week on Twitter I get somebody commenting on the way I look.’

Miss Willerton, 21, tried to comfort her fellow ITV contestant, claiming she had also experienced unkind remarks as a young girl.

She said: 'People say nasty things and you have to drive your inner confidence.'

Baroness Grey Thompson used a debate in the Lords to warn body image anxiety is a leading cause of depression and low self-esteem, triggering problems at school and work for many women.

 two Olympic gold medals – had to be comforted by her fellow female 
contestants after the sight of the bikini-clad model became too much for
 her to bear

She said: ‘Anyone who was watching Rebecca Adlington on I'm A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here last week will have seen her tearful reaction when talking about body image.

‘This is a young woman that we should all be proud of. She is a four-time Olympic medalist and a world champion, but many will understand how she feels.

‘It is a worrying trend that young women are increasingly put under pressure to conform to look a certain way.’

She added that if at the age of 15 she had thought she had poor body image she ‘would have been told to pull myself together’.

But she warned that ‘body image has become more important than health… the majority of young people would rather be thin than healthy’.

‘The reality is that young women are facing pressure from many directions.

‘For many women, a poor body image and lack of self-confidence is the biggest barrier that prevents them being active and it is easy to understand why.

‘Bizarrely it is one of the things that could help them. If you put “Jessica Ennis” and “abs” in to a search engine, there are pages that show how you can look like Jess in just two minutes a day. The reality is more like six hours a day, 50 weeks of the year for about 15 years.’

She also singled out comments about former Big Brother winner Chantelle Houghton who was ‘heavily criticised for going out jogging in a pair of running tights and a cropped top’.

Baroness Grey Thompson  added: ‘The obsession with how quickly celebrities lose their baby weight and get back into their pair of jeans puts undue pressure on others.’

Baroness Kidron, a cross-bencher, said: ‘How important is it for the young women whom we are discussing in this room that the vilification and objectification of sportswomen, such as Rebecca Adlington or Marion Bartoli, to name just two, should be simply unacceptable.’

Lib Dem Baroness Northover, speaking for the government, said: ‘It is enough to make me weep to hear about Rebecca Adlington.’

She said her own children trained at the same swimming club as Adlington’s fiancé, Harry Needs.

‘I know about the early mornings, the late nights, the galas and the falling into bed absolutely exhausted.

‘That is what she has done, and much more, to get to where she is. She should be proud of what she has achieved, and we should be proud of what she has achieved.

‘As we celebrate people’s diversity and encourage girls, as well as boys, to have the confidence to participate in sport, keep themselves fit and find satisfaction in doing so, we will help to address this linkage between how people view themselves and their body and the way they participate in society and, through that, in sport.’
