A Marine who shot two of his colleagues to death before killing himself amid a suspected love triangle at their barracks in northern Virginia on Thursday night has been identified.

Military officials say Sgt Eusebio Lopez, a 25-year-old tactics instructor at a school that tests Marines wanting to become officers, is responsible for the shooting that took the lives of two fellow Marines.

Lopez gunned down 19-year-old Lance Cpl. Sara Castromata just after taking the life of Cpl. Jacob Wooley, 23, at the Marine Corps Base Quantico in northern Virginia according to officials on Saturday.

Victims: Lance Cpl. Sara Castromata, 19, and Cpl. Jacob Wooley, 23, were both shot to death by Lopez with a senior military official saying there may have been a romantic entanglement between the three Marines

All three Marines worked together at the school but military officials have not described more on their relationship or released a motive for the shooting.

There may have been a romantic entanglement between the trio, however, according to a senior military official at the Pentagon speaking to the Washington Post on the condition of anonymity.

Lopez, of Pacifica, California, joined the corps in May of 2006 and was a teacher whose specialty was machine gunner.

He served a single tour in Iraq and two tours in Afghanistan according to his grandfather, while also engaging in anti-piracy missions at sea.

Castromata, of Oakley, California, was a warehouse clerk who had been in the Marines since December of 2011. She held three medals.

Wooley, a field radio operator of Guntown, Mississippi, joined the Marines in February of 2010.

Tragedy: Officials say Lopez first shot Cpl. Jacob Wooley before taking Castromata's life, pictured here, and his own

He had received at least five medals, ribbons and commendations with his service.

'He was never into anything that would cause a problem. He was right raised with a family that believes in the Lord,' his great-aunt, Jean Luker, told the Washington Post.

'All the young people loved him and thought of him as a fine person. I guess he was in the wrong place at the wrong time, is what it sounds like,' she said.

Lopez was an instructor at officer candidates school, known for its grueling 10-week program that evaluates Marines on physical stamina, intelligence and leadership.

Service: Wooley, of Guntown, Mississippi was a field radio operator who joined the Marines in February of 2010

The candidates must complete obstacle 
courses, hikes of up to 12 miles in full combat gear and take classes on
navigation and tactics that help them in the field, according to the 
school's website.

Lopez's great-grandfather, also Eusebio Lopez, said the Marines contacted their family on Friday night.

'They told us they were investigating more, and they'd let us know. He wasn't the type to do stuff like that,' said Lopez, 81.

But his Facebook page showed signs of emotional distress, according to the Washington Times.

On February 20 Lopez allegedly wrote in his status update, 'un f**kin believable!' while joking with friends about dumping a body in the Potomac River.

One day earlier, on February 19, he also posted: 'the way down to rock bottom doesnt hurt as much as when u get there...'
