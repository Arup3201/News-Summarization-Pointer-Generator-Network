The bunker in which Adolf Hitler married Eva Braun shortly before the couple  committed suicide is being re-created by a German museum despite fears it may be deemed insensitive.

A replica of the Fuhrerbunker, where Nazi leader Hitler spent his final months in Berlin, is being planned for a summer opening at The 'Top Secret' museum in Oberhausen, in the Ruhr valley more than 300 miles from its original location.

'We're just in the planning stages – the architects are working on it,' museum director Ingo Mersmann told thelocal.de.

Adolf Hitler's final hideaway the Fuhrerbunker is being re-created by a German museum

The underground complex was destroyed in 1947, after it was stormed in 1945 as the Third Reich fell

'We want this to be an educational experience so that families or groups of school kids can see how it really was: To experience the tiny rooms and the dampness of the bunker. We want to recreate it to show people.' 

Mersmann added: 'We are doing so very carefully and with sensitivity.' 

The museum is being careful not to create a place of pilgrimage for the few who still identify with the ideology of Hilter in their rebirth of the bunker that was originally at Potsdamer Platz and Brandenburg Gate in Berlin. 

Empty black frames will hang on the walls of the bunker instead of the portraits of Hitler that were in the original to make the bunker an educational piece and avoid it being considered any sort of tribute.

An unadorned plaque was erected in 2006, but it's policy in Germany to make Nazi landmarks as dull as possible so not to make them attractive destination for those who identify with Hitler's policy

'We certainly don't want to recreate a place for the misguided people who still see him as a hero to come as a pilgrimage. We are planning against that,' Mersmann said. 

The re-created complex will include the Nazi leader's rooms, his secretary's office, the radio room and the clinic occupied by Hitler's personal physician, Dr Morrell. 

Plans will be based on floor plans from the Federal Archives, along with historical pictures and documentation.

When the original bunker was stormed by Russian forces in 1945, after Hitler had moved there to use it as his base of command for German troops at the start of the year, it represented the fall of the Third Reich.

It was blown up in 1947 and now the site houses a car park. The only sign of its existence is a plaque showing the layout and some historical facts that was placed there in 2006 before the World Cup. 

Top Secret has previously courted controversy when they rebuilt the house Osama bin Laden's hiding place from which American forces pulled him out of in 2011.
