A mother was forced to watch in horror as her two young sons died a in trailer fire as she desperately tried to break down the locked door. 

The deadbolt activated Monday after the trailer's door closed, leaving Kayden Green, 4, Damion Green, 1, along with a girl, 3, stuck in the home, Twin Falls police told KTVB.

The children were in the High Desert RV park home as their mother Heather Green was outside, police told the affiliate station.

Creekside Court RV Park manager Gina Johnson told Magic Valley the mother-of-three told her she and a son clowned around before the fire, and moved trailer door back and forth to one another in a game - though it locked shut after she moved it in her son's direction.

'She was screaming for her daughter to unlock the door,' Johnson said.

The manager of the High Desert RV park, Gary, was injured after smashing a window in order to get Amiyah Green, the newspaper reported.

'Any quick-thinking person would have done the same thing,' he told the media outlet.  

Johnson told The Times-News Heather Green's hands suffered burns from trying to get the other children out.

Danger: A space heater next to items in the home caused the deadly accident, Twin Falls police have said 

Though the boys were stuck, Green 'was standing by the window with her hand in there, telling them that she loved them,' Johnson told the newspaper. 'She made sure they heard it until she heard no more from them.'

The girl  successfully got out of the trailer - though Kayden's and Damion's deaths were pronounced at a hospital after they were removed, KTVB reported.

A space heater next to items in the home caused the deadly incident, Twin Falls police told the affiliate station.

The girl was identified by The Times-News as Amiyah Green, the sister of the two boys who perished.

Father Christopher Green is incarcerated, officials told the newspaper.
