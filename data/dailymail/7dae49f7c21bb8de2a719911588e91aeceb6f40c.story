The parents of an aspiring weatherman who died from a gunshot wound to the head have slammed a police investigation into his death as 'a whitewash' after it ruled their son took his own life.

Bill and Therese Engelhardt said they are now hiring a private investigator to look into the death of their son Timothy.

The distraught couple said they are disgusted by the report which blames the 22-year-old for his own death.

An 'extensive investigation' into the young man's death by police in Florida ruled that he had been ranting about suicide at a friend's home before grabbing the barrel of a loaded gun and pointing it at his head.

Doubts: His parents, William and Therese, say he had everything to live for and wouldn't have taken his life

Timothy was shot in the head with the trigger apparently pulled by 26-year-old Jacob Eldred who was holding the gun.

'The police report is a load of bulls***. It is a whitewash and full of lies,'said Bill Engelhardt.

'My son did not take his own life. We wanted justice for Tim and we have not got this.

'We are hiring a private investigator to get to the bottom of this and find out the truth.'

Timothy, who was studying meteorology at the Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Daytona Beach,Florida, died on September 13th.

He was due to graduate next year and had already completed a successful internship at a local TV station in Boston and lined up a job on his graduation.

On the day he died Englehardt had been hosting a BBQ with his roommate Cody Moore.

Moore told Mail Online his friend had 'everything to live for' and had not been depressed.

He supplied the last ever photo of Engelhardt taken at the BBQ with the pair smiling as they cooked for friends at their rented home in Daytona Beach.

Tragic: Student Timothy Englehardt suffered a single gunshot to the head, dying as a result. He was studying to become a meteorologist at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Floriday

Scene of tragedy: The screened in porch where Timothy Englehardt died. Four other people were in the house at the time. 

Less than two hours later the aspiring weatherman was dead from a single gunshot wound to the head.

He had gone to a friend's house in nearby Holly Hill to feed their dogs.

According to the four people inside the home Englehardt started expressing suicidal thoughts after making a phone call.

The police report said he had excused himself to make the call and when he returned was in an 'agitated mood'.

Moments later he grabbed a gun that Eldred had been holding while the two men talked about Eldred's previous suicidal thoughts

The handgun's magazine had been removed but there was still a bullet in the chamber.

The report makes clear that Timothy grabbed the gun and pulled it towards his head. It is thought Eldred's finger was on the trigger when the gun went off.

However, the report clearly contradicts the earlier statement made by Stephanie Lauber who witnessed the killing.

When police responded to an emergency call, she told the arriving officer she saw Englehardt take the gun and pull the trigger.

Tauber said:'She advised that the victim, identified by her as Tim, also observed the magazine being removed from the weapon.

'She advised that she saw the victim take the weapon, place it to his head and pull the trigger. She advised that the victim then collapsed to the floor.

'She then began saying that she believed the shooting was actually an accident as the weapon was supposed to be unloaded.'

The police report makes no mention of Engelhardt pulling the trigger.

Bill Engelhardt said the report compiled by Holly Hill Police chief Steve Aldrich was 'full of lies'.

He takes exception to the claim by witnesses that his son had become agitated after calling home.

'Mr Aldridge told me that the witnesses said Tim went out to make a phone call to his mother and then came back in an agitated state. That is just a lie.

'We had not spoken to Tim for several hours. There was no call to us before he died. The phone records will prove that.

Also in the house: Stephanie Lauber, 22, a classmate of Englehardt, made the 911 call to say he had shot himself. A voice int he background can be heard apparently saying: 'I did it.' Lauber then tells that person: 'No, you didn't. Relax. You didn't kill him.'

On the rise: Englehardt, pictured right, had completed an internship with WCVB in Boston over the summer

'The police have just taken the word of those in the house and they have lied.They have not looked into anything about Tim otherwise they would know that he was not suicidal.

'We are beside ourselves. This is just sickening. The others in the house had lied to cover themselves.'

The four people in the house were named as Lauber, Eldred, Charles Eichler, and Rachel Schlosberg.

Police initially become suspicious about the death due to a call to the 911 dispatcher when a male voice could be heard in the background saying: 'I did it'.

Lauber,who made the 911 call, replied: 'No, you didn't. You did not kill him.'

Lauber refused to talk with Mail Online when contacted at the civil engineering office where she worked in Daytona Beach.

Another puzzling aspect for police was why the why the gun was found in another room away from his body

The police investigation clears that aspect up by revealing Eldred was holding the gun when it went off and said he placed it on a coffee table.

Investigated: Holly Hill Police Chief Steven Aldrich, whose force have now completed their investigation. It has been heavily criticized by the dead man's parents 

Happy: Englehardt with an unnamed friend was said to be enjoying himself at university and had booked tickets home for Thanksgiving

The Engelhardts said they had hoped police in Holly Hill would have carried out a more thorough investigation.

'There is so many parts of the report that are wrong,' said Bill, from Haverhill, Massachusetts.

'We believe there has been a cover up. People are lying and those in the house have come up with a credible story that the police believe.

'Holly Hill Police chief Steve Aldrich told me on the phone today that my son was talking to my wife just before he died. My wife would know if she talked to her own son. The phone records will be the proof as he did not call. They have just taken the words of those in the house, and they are lying.

'We have waited three months for this report and it's a whitewash. Tim had just been told by his grandmother that she would pay for his flight ticket home. He was happy. Why would he take his own life. We want answers.'

The Holly Hill Police Department has completed its extensive investigation into the death of Timothy Englehardt on the night of September 13, 2014, at  - Clifton Avenue, Holly Hill.

After a thorough investigation of the facts and circumstances surrounding Mr. Englehardt's death, a criminal complaint affidavit will be forwarded to the State Attorney's office charging Jacob Eldred, 26 yoa, with the Improper Exhibition of Dangerous Weapons or Firearm (1st degree Misdemeanor). 

A copy of the criminal complaint affidavit will be released when it is filed with the State Attorney's Office for their review.

Our investigation into the death of Timothy Englehardt revealed that Timothy had gone to his friends' home to care for Jacob Eldred's pet prior to Mr Eldred's return from a daytrip in the Gainesville area. 

Upon returning home, Jacob Eldred and his friends, (Stephanie Lauber, Charles Eichler, and Rachel Schlosberg) found Timothy still at the house. Once in the home, the group began to talk and drink sociably.

Witness statements indicated that after a short period of time, Timothy Englehardt excused himself to the rear yard during a phone conversation.

While Timothy Englehardt was in the rear yard speaking on the phone, Charles Eichler and Rachel Schlosberg excused themselves to Charles Eichler's bedroom, in the rear of the residence, for a more private conversation.

Jacob Eldred and Stephanie Lauber were in the front Florida Room when Timothy returned from his phone conversation in an agitated mood. 

According to witness statements, Timothy began ranting about his perceived personal problems and making suicidal statements. 

Growing weary of Timothy's ranting about suicide, Jacob Eldred removed the magazine from his .45 caliber firearm that he normally carried and confronted Timothy about his suicidal statements.

While standing face to face with Timothy, Jacob had his handgun out pointing it at himself telling Timothy about his own past thoughts of harming himself and the fact that it was never the right thing to do. 

According to witness statements, Timothy then grabbed the barrel of the gun and pulled it toward his head. The firearm immediately discharged striking Timothy Englehardt in the head.

While still holding the firearm, Jacob Eldred immediately placed the firearm on a nearby coffee table and exited the room with Stephanie Lauber.

Stephanie Lauber immediately placed a phone call to 911 to report the shooting and to summon emergency assistance.

Any further informational releases related to this case will be at the discretion of the State Attorney's Office once they have reviewed the case.
