But Met Office has warned warm spell unlikely to continue into next week

While leaves on the line is often used as an excuse for train delays, the unseasonably warm weather is now being blamed by operators who are cancelling services due to the wrong type of soil.

Network Rail has cancelled First Capital Connect services between Ely, Cambridge, Downham Market and Norfolk because dry soil has caused the rails to shift.

Passengers expecting to use the services tomorrow and next Sunday will be forced to use replacement buses while repairs to the tracks are carried out.

A spokesman for Network Rail said: 'The closures are necessary because the ground on this stretch of track is drying out owing to a lack of rainfall in the area.

'As a result of the dry weather, ground movement has caused the tracks to become out of direct alignment with the overhead lines used to power trains.

'Services have been running at a reduced speed to minimise the chances of any disruption and remedial work has been carried out.

'It is absolutely essential that we carry out this work to keep the railway running efficiently and safely.'

The mild temperatures are set to continue throughout the weekend and will mean Britain is hotter than Jordan.

It will be unseasonably mild, according to predictions, with temperatures averaging 14c (57f) across Britain, as the unexpectedly warm November weather continues.

Last Thursday, temperatures in 
Gravesend, Kent, reached 16.2c (61f). And today, they are expected to 
reach 15.5c (60f) there – hotter than Amman, Jordan, where the 
temperature is 13c (55f).

It
is also set to be warmer than Damascus, Syria, where it is 13c and 
match Shanghai, China, where it is 15c.

The outlook is not entirely 
positive, though, as some areas will be cloudy and may see showers, 
according to forecasts.

So far, temperatures this month have averaged 9.4c (49f) – 3.5c above the November average of 5.9c (43f).

But it could soon be time to finally dig out those woolly jumpers, as the Met Office has warned that the warm spell is unlikely to continue much past this weekend.

Sarah Holland, a Met Office 
forecaster, said: ‘The first part of the month has been very warm. We 
have been seeing very mild temperatures of around 14-15c during the day 
which will continue into the weekend.’

The unseasonably warm weather is down to milder southerly winds blowing across from the Continent, according to the forecaster.

Normally, Britain would be experiencing cooler westerly winds from across the Atlantic.

‘The warm weather is also down to an area of high pressure over the UK and that brings in the milder conditions,’ she added.

'As we move into next week, we will 
see temperatures return to normal for November. It will be quite cold, 
especially compared with the warmer weather we’ve been experiencing.’

Night-time
temperatures this month, averaging 6.6C (44f) over the first 15 days, 
have also been higher than the average of 4-5c (39-41f).

And this November has been one of the
driest on record, with 25.6mm of rain falling – 22 per cent of the 
monthly average of 116mm.  But Miss Holland said it would be difficult 
to predict whether it would be the warmest on record.

The current record for November was set in 1994, when temperatures averaged 8.8c (48f).

TOMORROW: Dry and cloudy with sunny spells across the bulk of England, Wales and northern Scotland, although morning mist and fog will be slow to clear.

Elsewhere, mainly cloudy, with occasional rain or showers. North - High: 14c (57f) Low: 9 (48ft) South: High: 16c (61ft) Low: 8c (46ft)

MONDAY: Rain in many places lingering in the east on Tuesday.North - High: 12c (54ft) Low: 8c (46ft)South: High: 12c (54ft) Low: 10c (50ft)

TUESDAY: Brighter conditions push into the west but won't last long resulting in a chilly to start to Wednesday.North- high: 11c (52 ft Low: 10c (50 ft)South - High: 13 (55ft) Low: 11c (52ft)

While the warm weather might seem like a blessing to most of us, it has left wildlife confused.

Swallows, whose arrival usually marks the beginning of summer, have been spotted on Teesside.

Frogs have begun mating and in London, a duck has hatched a clutch of 11 ducklings six months earlier than usual.

The ducklings, which would normally be born between April and June, could be seen paddling on the entrance lake at the London Wetland Centre, in Barnes, yesterday.

Jamie Wyver, of the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust, said: ‘Fortunately, the mild weather means there is still a fair bit of greenery out there for the ducklings to nibble on.’

The balmy conditions that Britain has been experiencing look set to continue into next week.

It has also left forecasters admitting that - despite being so close to Christmas - there is still no sign of winter.

Forecaster Brian Gaze of The Weather 
Outlook added: 'The mild southerly winds causing this unusually-mild 
autumn are proving incredibly stable and difficult to shift, with no 
imminent arrival of winter ahead.'
