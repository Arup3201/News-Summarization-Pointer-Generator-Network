When the Apple Watch was first envisioned, designers imagined a device packed full of sensors that could measure heart rate, stress levels, blood pressure and more.

But a report now claims that, one-by-one, many of these sensors were dropped because they were unreliable or erratic.

Sources told The Wall Street Journal that the watch even became dubbed 'black hole' internally because it continued to suck in resources for four years.

According to reports, the Californian firm experimented with sensors for its Apple Watch (range pictured) that measured conductivity of the skin to track stress levels and monitor heart-rate, but ‘these features didn’t perform consistently on some people, including those with hairy arms or dry skin’

The report added that Apple also struggled to find a purpose for the watch after the sensors were ditched, and were left 'wrestling with why a consumer would need or want such a device.'

Apple has not responded to MailOnline's request for comment.  

Apple is expected to launch the smartwatch in March with prices starting at $349, although a high-end 18-karat gold model could cost thousands of dollars.

According to reports, Apple experimented with sensors that measured conductivity of the skin to track stress levels and monitor heart-rate, but 'these features didn't perform consistently on some people, including those with hairy arms or dry skin'.

The results were also said to have varied on how tightly the watch was being worn.

Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak has previously been critical of smartwatches but in an interview with the BBC he has said the Apple Watch's display is 'like a little piece of art.'

He believes people in 'hip, camp areas' will want it instantly, as will Apple's existing customers, meaning 'millions of people will buy this watch from the start and that helps get the critical mass going.'

Mr Wozniak co-founded Apple with Steve Jobs during the 1970s, and was responsible for designing the Apple I computer. He left the company in 1987.

He recently said that no company has yet been able to create a 'compelling' smartwatch, and he had been disappointed with early models of the technology.

'Like Apple did with smartphones, one company may point the right way to a smart and useful watch, but it shouldn't be a replacement for what the phone does,' continued Mr Wozniak.

Other sensors, such as detecting blood pressure and oxygen, were inconsistent and too complex and would have needed regulator approval.

However, Apple didn't remove all the sensors. 

On the back of the case, a ceramic cover with sapphire lens covers a sensor that uses infrared and visible-light LEDs and photodiodes to detect heart rate. 

Apple Watch will use this sensor, along with an accelerometer and the GPS and Wi‑Fi in a paired iPhone, to measure  physical movement. 

This will work with the Watch's Activity app that can set Move goals, track exercise and make sure the wearer doesn't sit down for too long.

There will additionally be a Workout app to motivate wearers. 

Plus, developers will be able to create new apps with Apple's WatchKit.  

The more complex features may also be included in future models, said 'people familiar with the matter'.

Apple has asked its Asian suppliers to make 5-6 million units of its three Apple Watch models for the first-quarter, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

Taiwan-based Quanta Computer Inc, the sole assembler of the Apple Watch, started mass production earlier this year to get ready for an April launch, the Journal said.

Thousands will work round the clock during the Chinese New Year holidays at Quanta's factory in Changshu, China, the newspaper reported, quoting one person.

Analysts predicts sales of wearables will grow from 29 million in 2014 to 172 million in 2018, with a spike in 2015.

CCS Insight's latest forecast believes the most popular devices will be smartwatches and fitness trackers.

Ben Wood, CCS Insight's Chief of Research said: 'The Apple Watch will be instrumental in taking the wearables market to the next level of growth.

If successful, it'll create a rising tide that will lift the whole market.'

'If the Apple Watch performs as well as expected, its halo effect will result in a sales bonanza in the second half of 2015, with record-breaking shipments in the important fourth quarter.'

Last month, reports emerged that even without all these sensors, Apple's Watch will only last 19 hours on a full charge.

The results were also said to have varied on how tightly the watch (pictured) was being worn. Other sensors, such as detecting blood pressure and oxygen, were inconsistent and too complex, and would have needed regulator approval. The report added that Apple also struggled to find a purpose for the watch

Apple fan site 9to5Mac said: 'For the first time, people with knowledge of the Apple Watch's development have provided us with the specific performance targets Apple wants to achieve for the Apple Watch battery, but the actual numbers may fall short of those targets.

'According to our sources, Apple opted to use a relatively powerful processor and high-quality screen for the Apple Watch, both of which contribute to significant power drain.'

It said Apple wanted the Watch to provide roughly 2.5 to 4 hours of active application use versus 19 hours of combined active/passive use, three days of standby time, or four days if left in a sleeping mode.

But, the site's sources said Apple will only likely achieve approximately two to three days in either the standby or low-power modes.

Last year, designers created an online demo of how apps may work on the Apple Watch. 

Created by Pipes, the interactive watch is modelled on official images released by Apple, and lets people see how their messages, emails and homescreen will look and work. 

The demo also shows how push notifications will appear, and lets users control music on the virtual watch. 

Apple Watch will use this sensor, along with an accelerometer and the GPS and Wi‑Fi in a paired iPhone (pictured with boss Tim Cook), to measure physical movement. The more complex features may also be included in future models, said 'people familiar with the matter'

Apple's chief executive Tim Cook (pictured) unveiled the watch at a launch event in September. In December, reports said Apple is 'finishing up' work on the watch's software and it could go on sale in March

So far Apple has refused to reveal exactly when it will be released, although a statement made to Apple employees suggests the release will be in 'the spring.' 

It was previously claimed that suppliers were struggling to make enough screens and processors.

Unveiled on 9 September at Apple's iPhone 6 launch event, the Apple Watch is the company's first foray into wearables.

The watch has a completely new user interface, different from the iPhone, and the 'crown' on the Apple Watch is a dial called the 'digital crown.'

Users can turn the crown to zoom in and out on a map, or scroll a list.

The crown can also be pressed to take the user back to the home screen.

Different areas on the watch face can be customised with taps and swipes, and force touches.

The Glances feature shows info users would like to see, similar to Google Now, and is accessed by swiping the screen up from the bottom.

Music can also be controlled on an iPhone through the Apple Watch.

Built-in is a 'taptic engine' that responds to a subtle vibrations users feel on their wrist for notifications.

It understands questions in messages and then offers pre-selected answers, and messages can be dictated to the iPhone.

Users can also talk to the watch and send a voice reply, or have it transcribed to them.

There is no keyboard on the watch, and messages can only be sent through dictation, or emoji. 

Siri is also built into the Apple Watch.

Samsung, LG, Sony, Motorola and Microsoft have already launched their own smartwatches, but Apple is expected to face unprecedented demand for its timepiece.

Quanta, which is building the watch, has upped its number of workers from 2,000 to 10,000 and is ultimately aiming for 20,000. 

The initial round of shipments will be 3 to 5 million watches, and Apple anticipates a total of 24 million watches to be shipped during 2015.

Clicking the mouse and moving it to the left and right will swipe through pages on the watch's face. And clicking an individual icon will open that particular app (Messages app pictured left). For example, clicking the iTunes icon opens a music player (right) and lets users press play and pause, and change the volume
