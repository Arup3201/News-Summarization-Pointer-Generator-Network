Ukip leader Nigel Farage has come under criticism from Prime Minister David Cameron

Another Ukip council candidate was facing suspension last night for posting a stream of ‘crackpot’ homophobic and anti-Muslim comments on Twitter and Facebook.

Harry Perry, who is standing in Stockport, said ‘Islam is evil,’ claimed homosexuality was an ‘abomination before God’ and described David Cameron as a ‘gay-loving nutcase’.

The disclosures emerged as the Prime Minister yesterday attacked Nigel Farage’s party as ‘discredited’.

Mr Cameron, launching the Conservatives’ local election campaign, said: ‘I don’t need to discredit Ukip – they do a good enough job themselves.’

He has recently sought to avoid direct criticism of Ukip, which appears on course to top the poll in elections to the European Parliament later this month.

But he spoke out after a series of controversies involving Ukip candidates and donors accused of sexism, racism and homophobia.

Mr Perry’s comments came to light after he sent a private message to the Liberal Democrat general election candidate, Lisa Smart, on Facebook.

One of them said all three mainstream parties were seeking to ‘change our culture as fast as possible without permission from the white indigenous population’, before adding: ‘Don’t you know Lisa that God hates ­homosexuality, you cannot be a Christian and support the gay issue.’

Miss Smart said: ‘People should know what they are voting for on May 22.’

Mr Perry, who was unavailable for comment last night, also said Islam was ‘evil’ and called for Pakistan to be ‘nuked’.

Ukip deputy leader Paul Nuttall confirmed the party would investigate.

The revelations will heap ­further embarrassment on Ukip.

Earlier this week another candidate, in North London, tweeted that comedian Lenny Henry should emigrate to a ‘black ­country’ and compared Islam to the Third Reich.

William Henwood later resigned his membership of the party.
