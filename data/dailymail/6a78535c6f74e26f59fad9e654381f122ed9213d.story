We may have enjoyed one of the warmest autumns on record.

But winter will be settling in tomorrow as temperatures plunge below freezing in parts of the country.

And temperatures in the north will plummet as low as –2C (28F) tomorrow night, as a front of high pressure moves in from the north-west.

It means much of Britain will wake up to frost on Wednesday morning, which is likely to be followed by more freezing weather the following night.

The cold snap has caused bookmakers to slash the odds of a White Christmas, with Ladbrokes changing the odds of snow falling in London from 7/1 to 5/1.

Liverpool and Leeds are at 5/1, down from 6/1, while Edinburgh and Glasgow have fallen from 9/2 to 7/2.

Met Office forecaster Calum MacColl said the UK would experience a ‘shot of cold air’ – described by meteorologists as ‘polar maritime air’ – in the north-west tomorrow from the northern Atlantic.

He added: ‘There is likely to be widespread frost across central England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, but it will possibly be milder in the south where it will be cloudier.

‘Across north-west Scotland we could certainly see some snow above 400m.’

Alexi Venerus, a forecaster at Meteogroup, said: ‘There will be frost across the bulk of the country on Tuesday. We may get some wintry showers over high ground in north-west Scotland.

‘Through the week there will be places that will get down to zero overnight and the weather will become more unsettled.’

The icy blast will be a dramatic change from this year’s mild autumn, which was the third warmest since 1910.

The average temperature was 10.8C (51F) – 1.4 degrees above the 30-year average.

Only the autumns of 2006 and 2011 have been warmer this century, with average temperatures of 11.4C (53F) and 11.3C (52F).

November 2014 was also the joint fourth warmest since records began, with an average UK temperature of 7.7C (46F) – making it 1.5 degrees hotter than usual.
