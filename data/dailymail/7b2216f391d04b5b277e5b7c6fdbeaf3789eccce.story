A jailer's girlfriend is believed to have shot and killed herself with a gun the deputy handed to her following a heated argument in their bedroom.

Nikki Guined took the 9mm-Glock pistol from Dwight Buchanan, 20, while partying in their Monroe, Georgia, home and pulled the trigger during the drunken row last Wednesday.

The 20-year-old cashier repeatedly asked Buchanan, who has trained with the U.S. Army infantry, to hand her the weapon while saying: 'Don't you trust me?'

The cashier repeatedly asked Buchanan, who has trained with the US Army infantry, to hand her the weapon while saying to him: 'Don't you trust me?' 

Initially Buchanan took the magazine out and gave her the gun unloaded, but Guined told him to put it back.

According to WSBTV he put one round in the chamber, which is when she grabbed the gun shot herself in the jaw.

The deputy told police that Guined had threatened to leave him earlier in the day as they partied with another couple and a visitor, but the pair had reconciled and went to the bedroom. 

When investigators arrived, they found the house covered in beer cans. A report by Deputy J. Ricks stated that Guined had been drinking while Buchanan could not remember the basis of the fight.

Three people were said to have been in the house at the time but the group only heard the gunshot and not what the pair were arguing about. 

Buchanan had been employed as a jailer for 13 months and has a good record but has now been placed on paid administrative leave following the incident.  

Sheriff Joe Chapman and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation are now looking into the concerning shooting to find out whether it was accidental.

Investigators found the home the pair shared with another couple covered in beer cans following the shooting. According to the police report, Guined had been drinking all day 

He said: 'That is why we're having the GBI look at this. We want to make sure everything is …transparent and I want the family of the girl to know we are doing everything we can so they don't have any questions.

'Alcohol was involved, you just don't know what led up to it. We don't know what she was thinking.

I can't sit here and say that he was at fault in any way or wasn't at fault. 

'We’ll look at all the evidence and all the facts and we will determine what his future holds.' 

Authorities are also looking into the background of the gun as jailers such as  Buchanan are not issued a service weapon.

On Facebook, Buchanan posted pictures of himself training with the U.S. Army Infantry in Georgia.
