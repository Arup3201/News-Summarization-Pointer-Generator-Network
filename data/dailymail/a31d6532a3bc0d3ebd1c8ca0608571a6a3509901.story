The next swing coach for Tiger Woods might be Tiger Woods as the golf great deliberates on his next move. 

Woods posted a blog on his website saying there was no "hard-and-set" rule on finding a new swing coach.

He split with Sean Foley last month after two years. Woods completed only 25 rounds this year because of a back injury that required surgery and is not playing until the World Challenge in December.

Tiger Woods is in no rush to appoint a new swing coach 

It has been a stop-start year for Woods because of a back injury that required surgery

He says he needs to get healthy before he sorts out where to go with his game and is keeping his options "very, very open."

Woods says he has bounced some ideas off Notah Begay, a former teammate at Stanford University and a longtime friend. He says they have discussed what direction Woods should go with his game.

It is more than six years since Woods last won a Major - the 2008 US Open.
