Australian's sun safety has been slipping with a new survey revealing that 430,000 more adults are getting sunburnt on the weekend than they were four years ago.

The findings, from Cancer Council's National Sun Survey which looked at the sun protection habits of 5000  Australian adults, estimated that about 2.4 million people are getting sunburnt on an average summer's weekend across the country.

Craig Sinclair, Cancer Council's Chair of Public Health Committee and an expert on skin cancer prevention, told Daily Mail Australia that the reason for the increase in complacency for excessive exposure to UV was due to a lack of national skin cancer awareness campaigns.

'We haven't had a national sun protection campaign for over five years, so part of this reason for the increase could be very well attributed to this fact,' Mr Sinclair said.

'We know our cancer campaigns are effective in motivating behaviour change, particularly in people covering their body and hat wearing.

'There is a direct correlation and this data is clearly a call to action for more government investment in public campaigns.'

Mr Sinclair said that the government had an incentive to raise awareness through prevention programs, as sun cancer leads to almost one million doctor visitations each year.

'Sun cancer is the most expensive burden of all cancers,' he said.

'In terms of cost to the public health system, but also in terms of human costs: the 11 thousand plus Australians who are getting diagnosed with melanoma each year.'

The survey also found that men were more likely to get sunburnt than women and neglect protecting their skin, with 18 per cent getting sunburnt on the weekend compared to 12 per cent of women.

'We haven't had a national sun protection campaign for over five years, so part of this reason for the increase could be very well attributed to this fact,' Craig Sinclair, Cancer Council's Chair of Public Health Committee and an expert on skin cancer prevention, said

'We can't explain that exactly, maybe it's because they spend more time outdoors than women, maybe they're more inclined to wear less or have less regard for skin protection,' Mr Sinclair said.

'But it is a concern as it will undoubtedly lead to higher melanoma rates for men than women.'

The Cancer Council encourages people to minimise their UV exposure by wearing appropriate clothing and sunscreen and recognising that the first signs of sunburn can occur within 15 minutes in the sun.
