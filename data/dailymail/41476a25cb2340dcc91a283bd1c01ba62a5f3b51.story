Freeze, don't move! This is the moment a very disciplined dog balances 50 biscuits on his nose.

Alton Bollom from Texas filmed the moment he built a Jenga tower out of bite-size bones on his Golden Retriever, Carson's, snout.

The very patient pooch appears completely frozen and merely blinks as the last 'brick' is added.

Carson the Jenga dog: This is the moment a very disciplined pooch balances 50 dog treats on his nose

When he's told to 'get it', Carson suddenly twirls around and the edible tower falls down.

He then digs into his dinner, lay scattered over the floor. 'Good boy,' Mr Bollom is heard saying as he gives Carson a well-deserved pat on the back.

The pet currently holds the record for the Most Treats Balanced On A Dog's Nose on the website recordsetter.com.

In other videos Carson's owner shows the complete start-to-finish construction process.

Each time around the four-legged performer sits with his nose in the air, ready to put his balancing skills on show.

To date, Carson's YouTube videos have garnered more than one million views.

'Never in a million years would one of my dogs do this,' one fan wrote.

Another exclaimed: 'If only I had that level of discipline!'
