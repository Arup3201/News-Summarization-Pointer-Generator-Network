Rio Ferdinand has hailed his former Manchester United team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo ahead of Monday's Ballon d'Or ceremony - lauding the Real Madrid forward as the 'best player on the planet'.

Queens Park Rangers defender Ferdinand selected Ronaldo in his EA Sports FIFA Team of the Year for 2015 - alongside the Portgueuse forward's Real team-mate Gareth Bale and arch-rival Lionel Messi in a potentially-lethal front three.

Ronaldo will go up against Barcelona's Messi and Bayern Munich's Manuel Neuer - who gets the goalkeeping spot in Ferdinand's side - for the Ballon d'Or on Monday, with the Portuguese forward a heavy favourite to claim his second successive award, and the third of his career.

Cristiano Ronaldo is the 'best player on the planet' and should win the Ballon d'Or, says Rio Ferdinand

And former United centre back Ferdinand believes Ronaldo fully deserves the accolade after enjoying a 2014 which 'set him apart' from Messi.

Ferdinand - who recently joined an EA Sports FIFA 15 panel to debate his Team of the Year alongside QPR team-mate Joey Barton, AFC Wimbledon striker Adebayo Akinfenwa and Tottenham Hotspur right back Kyle Walker - said of Ronaldo: 'He’s the best player on the planet.

'Him or Messi (should win the Ballon d'Or), as they are the best players in the world. Messi was fantastic last year but Ronaldo I think nicked it; he played particularly well scoring lots of goals last year as well.

'He scored more than Messi last year I think, and he won the Champions League and that sets him apart.

'(Messi is just) Just a magician, a genius. Someone of his height and physical capability, he shouldn’t be doing what he’s doing but he’s breaking all the records.

'You need a couple of you (to defend against him)! But even then, he finds a way.

'The other day he scored a goal, he nutmegged someone and just passed it into the back of the net and that’s the difference between him and Ronaldo. Ronaldo is more pace and power, both feet, scores every type of goal, whereas Messi passes the ball into the net and Ronaldo more forces the ball into the back of the net a lot of the time.'

Ronaldo arrived at Old Trafford in 2003 and played with Ferdinand for six years before departing for the Bernabeu in 2009.

As soon as Ronaldo arrived in the North West, Ferdinand explains that he knew the now 29-year-old would go on to dominate world football one day.

He continued: 'You could see from the moment that he came in the door at Man United that he was going to be a top player, how far he was going to go you never knew, but for me that’s what I appreciate more about him than anything is that he has made himself a top player in the world.

'He could have been a great player, but he’s gone on to be the best player in the world, and right now he is that. That is through sheer desire and determination and through ability. 

'And on the right (of my team), is Gareth Bale who potentially could take over these two (Ronaldo and Messi as the best player in the world), as he started younger, he’s fresher. He could be the one who comes on and takes that mantle of being the best player in the world.'

Interestingly, Ferdinand places Paul Scholes alongside Ronaldo as the best players he has ever played alongside.

'Scholes is the most natural footballer I have played with in that he could finish football; he actually retired and then came back and was still the best player in training after eight months or whatever it was that he didn’t play.'

In terms of Ferdinand's team of the year itself, his side is anchored by Neuer in goal and would play in a 4-3-3 formation.

Speaking about German World Cup winner Neuer, who is looking to become the first goalkeeper to win the Ballon d'Or, the 36-year-old said: 'I think he is the best keeper on the planet and he’s not a traditional goalkeeper just staying on his line, he comes out and cleans up behind the back line.'

Protecting Neuer's goal is a back four of Germany World Cup-winning captain Phillip Lahm at right back, Bayern Munich's David Alaba at left back, plus Diego Godin from Atletico Madrid and Real's Raphael Varane, who Ferdinand labels as 'potentially the best centre half in the world' because he is 'quick, strong, (has) anticipation, calm, (is) decent on the ball and won the Champions League'.

Ferdinand's midfield would be made up of Bayern midfielder Xabi Alonso, Real's Toni Kroos and Man United winger Angel di Maria.

When explaining his midfield picks, Ferdinand added: 'Three man midfield. At the base is Xabi Alonso to dictate the pace of the game. Great technician, great passer and great tactical awareness. 

'Toni Kroos is another great passer of the ball, pops up with a goal here and there as well and I think that he is a fantastic player that is going to go on and probably dominate midfields for a long time. World Cup winner as well so he had to be in there.

'Left side of the three is Angel di Maria. Last year at Real Madrid he was arguably their best player. He’s great at getting the ball at one end of the pitch and dragging the team up to the other end of the pitch and causing havoc.

'You don’t get many midfielders who can turn defence into attack the way that he does on the ball, committing players.'
