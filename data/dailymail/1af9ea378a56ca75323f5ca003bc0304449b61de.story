You're an unhappy man, Charlie Brown: Peter Robbins is not looking forward to the new Peanuts movie

The man who voiced cartoon favourite Charlie Brown has called the forthcoming Peanuts movie pointless and a ‘horrible idea’.

Peter Robbins, who was the first person to voice Charlie Brown, accuses 20th Century Fox of lacking creativity and trying to steal the thunder of the original televised version of the popular cartoon.

The new Peanuts film is expected to hit the silver screen in November 2015 with a screenplay written by the cartoon’s creator Charles M Schulz’s son and grandson.

Mr Robbins, 56, famous for voicing Charlie Brown’s trademark screams of frustration in the 1960s, told TMZ: ‘What's the point?

'If it's to reintroduce the character of Charlie Brown to a new generation, it's been passed on successfully for 46 years. That's the beauty of it.’

Comparing the new flick to a ‘knock-off band’ he added: ‘If they were so creative why don't they come up with some new characters?’

‘It just seems to me they're trying to steal the thunder of these great classics, and from what I can tell, they're not qualified.’

‘It's perfect the way it is.’

The 2015 release will coincide with the 65th anniversary of the comic strip and the 50th anniversary of 'A Charlie Brown Christmas.’

The son of Peanuts creator Charles M. Schulz, Craig Schulz, as well as his grandson, Bryan Schulz,  worked on the screenplay together.

Classic: Mr Robbins voiced Charlie Brown, left, in the early 1960s and his interpretation of Charlie's characteristic 'AAUGH' outbursts is still used today

Creator: The popular cartoon strip was the brainchild of Charles M. Schulz

'We have been working on this project for years,' Craig Schulz, president of Charles M. Schulz Creative Associates, said in a statement. 'We finally felt the time was right and the technology is where we need it to be to create this film.'

He promised that the new film would be 'true to the strip and will continue the legacy in honor of my father.'

It will be produced by 20th Century Fox Animation and Blue Sky Studios and directed by Steve Martino, the director of Ice Age: Continental Drift and Dr. Suess' Horton Hears a Who.

The comic strip ran from October 2, 1950 to February 13, 2000, and in its prime reached 355 million people in 75 countries.
