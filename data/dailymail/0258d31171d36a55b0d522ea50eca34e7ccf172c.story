At only three days old, she is still a bit wobbly on her legs. But her future is already looking bright and the way ahead paved with gold.

For this foal’s famous father means she could be worth a cool £3million.

She is the first daughter of sporting legend Frankel, the world’s top-rated racehorse who won all 14 of his races before retiring in 2012.

Like her famous father, who is valued at £100million, the filly – who has yet to be named – is bay in colour and has a similar white blaze on her face.

Expectation: The three-day-old filly is the first daughter born to legendary racehorse Frankel. Huge pressure has been placed on the adorable foal to live up to her famous father and become a champion herself

Bright future: The as-yet-unnamed filly is described as 'a very nice quality, athletic individual' by Frankel's managing director, although he added there was no way to predict her success on the racecourse

But it will be some time yet before she gets a chance to show if she can follow in his record-breaking hoof prints.

She
 will not set foot on a racecourse for two years. Yesterday, however, 
her owners released images of her having a trot round a paddock at her 
birthplace, The National Stud in Newmarket, Suffolk.

She is the first of
 Frankel’s offspring to be presented to the public in this way, giving 
punters a glimpse of a potential wonderhorse.

Last
 night Brian O’Rourke, the stud’s managing director, described the filly
 as ‘very nice quality’ but  added: ‘When they’re this young there’s no 
way of knowing if they’re going to be champions.’

The
 filly was born at around 5.30am on Sunday. Her mother, Song, comes from
 good racing stock and is owned by Khalid Abdul Rahim, a construction 
magnate from Bahrain.

Legendary: Frankel, who is valued at £100 million, won all 14 of his races before retiring. He mated with 133 mares last year at his home at Banstead Manor Farm, near Newmarket, during his first season at stud

Good breeding: Frankel (left) mated with 133 mares between February and June last year, including Song, the mother of the three-day-old foal who stands at her feet (right)

Playful: The filly was born at the stud around 5.30am on Sunday. Her mother is a mare called Song, who comes from good racing stock and is owned by Khalid Abdul Rahim, a construction magnate from Bahrain

‘The 
pedigree of this filly is impeccable, with Frankel as the father and 
Song, who is unraced but from a family of horses that have won some of 
the best races in Europe, as mother,’ said one source.

Experts
 say it is too soon to know how much she is worth but she could fetch 
£3million in a year’s time. Song was sold for £824,000 in November while
 carrying her.

Frankel’s 
first foal – a colt born at Coolmore Stud in Co Tipperary on January 11 
to a mare called Chrysanthemum – is reported to have a potential value 
of £6million. Within days, bookmakers Coral were quoting 100-1 on him 
winning the Epsom Derby in 2017.

Horses which race on the flat, like Frankel, usually begin their racing careers aged two. So the foal is likely to be seen on the track for the first time in the summer of 2016

Big family: The filly already has one brother, with dozens more siblings expected later in the year

Colts
 are more valuable than fillies because, aside from their racing career,
 they can make vast sums at stud in comparison to mares who can breed 
only once a year.

Frankel, 
owned by Saudi Prince Khalid Abdullah, mated with 133 mares between 
February and June last year, his first season at stud.

He commands a fee
 of £125,000 a time and 126 of the mares are expecting foals or have 
given birth.

It means 
Frankel has already earned five times as much in stud fees as he did in 
prize money and the filly will be joined by a legion of siblings over 
the coming weeks.

News of 
the filly’s arrival delighted racing fans on Twitter. TV sports 
presenter Clare Balding posted: ‘Welcome to the world!’ Others suggested
 the name Frankelita.

Race 
horses are often not officially named until they start competing, which 
on the flat is usually from the age of two – so the first of Frankel’s 
offspring are likely to be in action from the summer of 2016.
