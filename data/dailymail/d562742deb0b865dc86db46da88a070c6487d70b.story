Cardiff will sell Chile World Cup midfielder Gary Medel to Inter Milan for £10million. 

Medel, 26, played 34 times last season but the club accepted it was unrealistic to keep him following relegation. He was Cardiff’s record signing a year ago when he moved from Sevilla for £11m.

It has been reported in the Italian media that Medel will take a paycut to join the Serie A side.

Big loss: Steven Caulker is just one of the Cardiff players who have already left, joining QPR

Galatasaray were also interested in the Chile star, while Inter were at first keen to take him on loan.

Fraizer Campbell and Steven Caulker recently left Cardiff for Crystal Palace and QPR respectively, but Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will hope to keep hold of other stars.

David Marshall will miss the start of the season after dislocating a finger.
