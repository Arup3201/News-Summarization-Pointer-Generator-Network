Mystery: Baby Ben, who was just 21 months old when he vanished in July 1991

British police searching for missing Ben 
Needham, who disappeared as a toddler 21 years ago, want to dig up a plot in Greece over suspicions he may be buried there,

Officers are in talks with police from the Greek island of Kos over fears that the little boy may have been accidentally buried under rubble.

Ben
was just 21-months-old when he disappeared from the island of Kos in 
July 1991, and there has been no trace of him since despite an 
international search. 

The Daily Mirror reported that Ben's body could have been covered up with rubble dumped by a driver who was excavating earth near to where he disappeared.

Officers are considering using sophisticated 3D scanning equipment to hunt for bones beneath the earth's surface, the newspaper reported.

South Yorkshire Police confirmed that they were contemplating making another search of the area where Ben vanished.

His mother, Kerry Needham, 40, said the 'heart wrenching' potential discovery of her son's dead body was a 'horrendous thought' but necessary.

She insists that Ben is still alive and told the Daily Mirror that she believed police would not find Ben in the latest investigation and this would lead to a renewed man hunt for her child.

Ms Needham, who was just 19 when Ben went missing, said to the newspaper: 'It is going to be soul destroying but once they have done it and not found Ben, the Greek police and everyone else in the world will know my son's alive.'

She said her years spent waiting for an answer as to what happened to her child had been torture, and that she and her family have been victims of untrue rumours that they had been involved with Ben's disappearance.

Ben
disappeared on the afternoon of July 24, 1991, after his young mother 
left him with her parents while she went to work at a hotel.

Eddie
and Christine Needham took him to a farmhouse belonging to their friend
Michaelis Kypreos, where the couple ate lunch as their grandson played 
outside.

But when they realised Ben had fallen silent, they discovered he was nowhere to be seen and called for a police search team.

Theories: Police believed that Ben may have wandered into tangled undergrowth and ended up under rubble the builders were dumping there

Greek police have regarded the theory that Ben was accidentally buried as one of the most plausible explanations for the youngster's disappearance, according to the Daily Mirror.

They believed that Ben may have wandered into tangled undergrowth and ended up under rubble the builders were dumping there.

Ben's file was re-opened in May after
JCB driver Konstantinos Barkas came forward to reveal he had been 
digging on the site when the boy went missing.

Kerry Needham has dismissed previous claims that Ben was buried under rubble and insists he is still alive

He told the Mirror at the time: 'Yes, I was the man with the JCB that day. Loads of earth was being taken to clear the ground for the new house down the road.'

The 61-year-old said he does not believe Ben was abducted.

At the time Ms Needham dismissed the new theory that he could have been buried close to the farmhouse, which was being renovated by her father Eddie.

Ms Needham said the rubble was already there when the Needham family were staying there.

She has always clung desperately to 
the belief that Ben is still alive and said she hopes he is happy with 
any family who have brought him up.

Ms Needham said at the time: 'My dad was renovating 
the farmhouse. There was some building work going on but it was further 
down the lane from the farmhouse where Ben was .

'The area where they are referring to
is to the left of the property. That mound of rubble and waste was 
already there while Ben was still there .

'I have to gather my strength 
and keep fighting. The one thing I don’t want to happen is for the 
British public to think "Ok then Ben’s dead and we no longer have to 
search for him".

'I believe Ben is not dead, he is still alive and he is well and he is living out there.'

Ms Needham claimed in June that she was being held to 
ransom by a man demanding £500,000 to reveal her son's whereabouts.

She said that
private investigators in Greece had contacted her through her Facebook 
page to say a man was offering information but wanted assurances that 
the original reward of £500,000 her family had offered was still 
available.

She said when she emailed the agency 
they said they had lost contact with the informant and privacy laws 
meant that they could not tell her his identity.
