If you're looking for the ultimate body and soul boost, we suggest a sip of 'miracle tree' juice. 

Moringa Green Superleaf Powder, produced by superfood brand Aduna, is not only packed with health-elevating nutrients but 10 per cent of profits are channeled back to help farmers in Africa too. What's not to love?

The powder is made from the leaf of the moringa ‘miracle tree’ – one of the most nutrient-dense plants on the planet.

The superfood phenomenon has been found to boost immunity, lower blood pressure, alleviate stress, fight fatigue, improve digestive health and increase libido. And that's just on the inside. It's also a tonic for the hair, nails and skin.

Aduna, meaning 'life' or 'world' in the local language of The Gambia and Senegal, is a food brand with a difference - ten per cent of profits is channeled back to help farmers in Africa

Aduna, meaning 'life' or 'world' in Wolof, the local language of The Gambia and Senegal, is a food brand with a difference. 

'Our mission is to breathe the vibrancy of Africa into the daily lives of people around the world, whilst creating a virtuous circle that feeds positive impacts back to the source,' explains Andrew Hunt, Aduna Co-Founder and Managing Director. 

That virtuous cycle means that whilst you're giving your body some African-grown tlc, the farmers in Africa who grow this type of crop are receiving some tlc back. 

In rural areas of Africa, women supply the vast majority of labour for harvesting and processing crops. And in North Ghana where Aduna have their processing centre, women provide up to 80% of labour.

'Aduna’s core business model is designed to create demand for the under-utilised, but extraordinary, natural products cultivated by these small farmers, who are generally surviving on less than $1 a day,' says Andrew.

'More than seventy percent of Africa’s one billion plus population live in rural areas. From this huge number, ninety percent depend on small or micro-scale farming as their primary source of livelihood. It would be fair to say that agriculture is the lifeblood of Africa,' he adds.

So what makes moringa so miraculous? It contains almost 25% protein including all nine of the essential amino acids, which helps to support the building blocks of proteins required for optimum growth, repair and maintenance of healthy skin cells. 

It provides 13 essential vitamins and minerals at RDA levels, including skin-supporting vitamins A, E, riboflavin (B2), niacin (B3), phosphorus and zinc, which have beauty benefits for strong, supple healthy skin, nails and hair. 

Moringa is a drought-resistant and fast-growing crop which makes it an ideal and sustainable income-generating activity for the remote rural producers that Aduna was created to support

Moringa also boasts an exceptional antioxidant profile including vitamins and phytochemicals (plant chemicals), which can help to protect cells from damage caused by free radicals. 

The tree is more potent than other antioxidant rich superfoods and has six times the antioxidant content of goji berries.

No wonder celebrity like Lily Cole and Livia Firth are fans of the superfood powder.

Moringa is a drought-resistant and fast-growing crop which can be harvested in just six weeks after planting and is also perennial. That's what makes it an ideal and sustainable income-generating activity for the remote rural producers that Aduna was created to support. 

Aduna's Moringa Green Superleaf Powder is officially the fastest-selling superfood in the UK

Every part of the moringa tree is valuable: from the seeds that are used for purifying water or producing rich cosmetic oils, to the bark, roots and flowers and, of course, the leaves. 

Once cut the leaves must not be touched by sunlight, so are harvested in moonlight. The leaves are then washed in purified water and naturally shade-dried. 

At this stage of the process, the nutritional value of the leaf increases significantly, up to over ten times that of fresh leaves.

Since landing in London's top department stores, Selfridges and Liberty's, and on the shelves in Holland & Barrett stores nationwide (£7.99), Aduna's Moringa Green Superleaf Powder is officially the fastest-selling superfood in the UK.
