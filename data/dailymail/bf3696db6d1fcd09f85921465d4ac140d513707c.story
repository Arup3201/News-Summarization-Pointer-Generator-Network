Journalist and author of the best-selling book I Quit Sugar has opened up about her own personal battle with mental illness, revealing she came close to taking her own life.

During a candid interview Sarah Wilson, 41, explained how anxiety drove her to believe she had reached a stage in her life where she 'couldn't see the point of continuing.'

'My anxiety brought me to a point where I couldn't quite see the existential point of continuing,' she told Women's Weekly Australia.

'I couldn't see a way out.'

Sarah Wilson opened up in a candid interview about how her battle with mental illness drove her to believe her life wasn't worth living

During the intimate interview Ms Wilson revealed it was a combination of issues, including mounting stress, anxiety, her thyroid disease and distant family, that drove her to believe her life was no longer worth living.

She said 'people get on with their lives' and while she hadn't found a husband, nor had children, she felt increasingly isolated.

'I was essentially very alone,' Ms Wilson added.

'I couldn't see a light at the end of the tunnel,' she added.

Ms Wilson said while she struggled through her younger years she has recently 'found some peace with it.'

In Ms Wilson's eyes, depression and anxiety are intrinsically linked. 

She thinks we need to acknowledge this link to be better equipped to tackle the increasing rate of Australian women who are being negatively affected by stress and anxiety. 

Ms Wilson said while she now accepts she is an 'anxious person', when she was younger she watched everybody else coping and felt like she had 'missed out on a guide book to life'

Ms Wilson said anxiety is quickly becoming the 'new depression'.
