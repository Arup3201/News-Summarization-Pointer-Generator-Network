Andy Coulson was not at the News of the World on the day a phone hacker claims he played him an incriminating voicemail from Sienna Miller, it was claimed yesterday.

Lawyers for the former Downing Street communications chief told a court he was not in London on the day Dan Evans claims he played him the hacked voicemail in the newspaper’s office.

Evans had described how Coulson allegedly listened to the taped message – in which Miss Miller told James Bond star Daniel Craig ‘I love you’ – and then masterminded an elaborate cover-up to hide the fact it was illegally hacked.

Claim: Andy Coulson, left, was not in the News of the World office at the time that Dan Evans, right, says he played him a hacked voicemail from Daniel Craig's phone, a court heard today

The journalist has repeatedly told 
the phone hacking trial that it was Coulson who told him to make a copy 
of the tape, put it in a Jiffy bag and pretend it had been sent to the 
paper’s office anonymously.

But
 Timothy Langdale QC, defending former News of the World editor Coulson,
 46, told Evans: ‘Mr Coulson wasn’t in the office at all that day.

‘He
 wasn’t even in London. What do you say to that?’ Evans, 38, appeared to
 falter as he admitted he could have made a mistake but insisted the 
tape-playing had happened as he described it.

He
 conceded he could have ‘consistently mis-remembered’ the day in 
question but told the Old Bailey: ‘Clearly my recollection hasn’t been 
perfect about when it happened, but happen it did.’

In tense courtroom exchanges, Mr Langdale questioned the accuracy of key elements of Evans’s evidence.

Affair: The message apparently revealed that Sienna Miller was having an affair with Mr Craig, her co-star in 2004 film Layer Cake

A
 second journalist, who supposedly heard the tape with Coulson, was also
 away from the office on the day in question, the barrister said.

Evans
 admits hacking Mr Craig’s phone and told the court he heard a message 
from Miss Miller saying: ‘Hi, it’s me, can’t speak, I’m at the  Groucho 
with Jude, I love you.’

Evans told the jury the message was left on September 24, 2005 and he played it to Coulson three days later.

But
 Mr Langdale said Miss Miller, who was going out with Jude Law at the 
time, was not at the Groucho Club in London that night. The jury has 
heard she was at her sister Savannah’s wedding in the West Country.

Evans
 also conceded a second message from Miss Miller, left on the phone of 
her step-mother Kelly Hoppen, could have been left by her sister.

Witness: Jude Law - Ms Miller's boyfriend at the time - gave evidence in the case this week

He
 faced lengthy questioning about why Coulson would have listened to an 
illegally hacked voicemail about a front page exclusive in the middle of
 an open-plan office.

Evans said there was a culture of arrogance at the newspaper which meant staff felt ‘untouchable’.

Mr
 Langdale repeatedly accused him of altering his account and said there 
was no call data to support his claims about when he hacked Mr Craig’s 
phone.

Evans insisted he was telling the truth, saying: ‘Why would I make this up? This isn’t a fun  experience for me.’

He has admitted phone hacking, conspiring to commit misconduct and lying in a witness statement.Evans
 has signed a deal with prosecutors under which his co-operation will be
 revealed to the judge before he is eventually sentenced.

Coulson
 denies conspiring to hack phones and commit misconduct. All seven 
defendants in the trial, including former Sun and News of the World 
editor Rebekah Brooks, deny all the charges. The trial continues.
