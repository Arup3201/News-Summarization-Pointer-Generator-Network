Pressure on the Red Arrows to perform as many displays as possible could have been a factor in the death of a pilot, a hearing has heard.

Flight Lieutenant Sean Cunningham, 35, died in November 2011 after his ejection
seat went off while he was on the ground at RAF 
Scampton in Lincolnshire. He was thrown into the air and his parachute failed to work.

Central Lincolnshire coroner Stuart 
Fisher told the pre-inquest hearing he will require witnesses to 
give evidence as to whether the pressure on the team affected their 
performance.

'There have been suggestions that the number of displays 
the team are required to perform has got to the point where it has put 
pressure on the team,' he said.

'As a consequence there has been a reduction in the amount of time they display.'

The hearing was told that in recent years the number of hours the Red Arrows are required to fly has been reduced by over ten per cent.

Mr Fisher said that witness evidence 
from Air Vice Marshall Mark Green, of the RAF’s 22 Training Group, 
showed the annual number of flying hours for the team had been reduced 
from 3,000 to 2,600.

Issues with the ejection seat firing handle and the working of the 
parachute are also to be examined when the full inquest is held in the 
New Year.

Flt Lt Cunningham, who was from Coventry, completed his first season with the Arrows in 2011 and held the position of Red 5 in the formation team at the time of his death.

He was the second member of the team to die tragically within three months following the loss of Flt Lt Jon Egging whose Hawk jet crashed during a display at an airshow in Dorset.

Examination: An inquest into the death of Flight Lieutenant Sean Cunningham will hear as to whether the pressure on the team affected their performance

Tom Kark QC, representing Flt Lt Cunningham’s family, said today 'The family would like the widest examination possible as to why their son and brother died.

'That includes why the seat firing handle was in the position that it could so easily activate the ejection system as it appears to have done.'

'The hearing needs to examine whether other engineers and pilots had been in a similar dangerous position to the one Mr Cunningham found himself and to ensure that cannot happen again.

'There are various issues  including whether there are systematic problems leading to the position of the handle being as it was.'

The inquest will also hear from Flt Lt Kirsty Stewart, the first woman pilot to fly with the Arrows.

The coroner said 'She had an incident where she was training at RAF Valley. She was sitting in the back seat of a Hawk aircraft and inadvertently one of her straps went through the ejection handle. When she got out she found the handle was in position and at risk of going off.'

Mr Fisher will also look at whether the ejection seat manufacturer Martin Baker Ltd communicated fully with the Ministry of Defence in relation to any problems with the equipment.

The pre-inquest hearing was told that parachute which should have saved his life in the event of the ejection seat firing apparently did not work because of a shackle nut being over-tightened.

A total of 40 witnesses are due to give evidence at the inquest due to start in January. Coroner Fisher said 'This is going to be a very thorough inquiry. I am going to leave no stone unturned.'

The Crown Prosecution Service decided not to bring criminal charges into the death following an investigation by Lincolnshire Police.

But there is still the possibility of the Health and Safety Executive taking action if a breach of health and safety regulations is identified.

Bernard Thorogood, representing the HSE, said no final decision will be made until the conclusion of the inquest.

The inquest is due 
to last for three weeks.
