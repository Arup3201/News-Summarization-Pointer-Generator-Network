Ambitious house-hunters are being offered the chance to create a heavenly home in a 19th century church - which is on the market for just £50,000.

The Grade II-listed St John's Church in Merthyr Tydfil, Wales is up for sale and boasts its own pulpit, stained-glass windows and a marble memorial to its founder.

But investors are also being enticed by the planning permission the building has already been given to be converted into 20 apartments.

The church was built in 1827 for the workers at a famous ironworks in the town and it was used for Sunday services right up until 1997

St John's Church in Merthyr Tydfil, Wales has gone on the market for £50,000 - less than the price of some garages in central London

The church was built by Josiah John Guest, a celebrated ironworker in the region whose company eventually became the top iron producer in the world.

The chapel was erected for his workers in 1827 and Mr Guest was buried in an iron coffin at the top of the chancel steps under a red, granite slab.

Among the building's features are a miner's window donated by Donny Osmond's grandfather, who was manager at the ironworks.

The historic church closed in 1997 after 170 years of holding services. It has remained derelict ever since.

The tomb of the founder of the church, Josiah John Guest, remains in the building after he was buried in an iron coffin under a granite slab

The pulpit of the church - from which scores of priests have delivered their sermons over the years - remains in the building

The property has been derelict for nearly 15 years but is now being sold with planning permission to build 20 apartments inside

The building now has planning permission to be converted into flats - as well as listing building consent which ensures some of the historic features remain.

Stephen Morgan, auctions manager at Darlows Auction, said: 'The property has fantastic potential, especially for conversion into flats which is something the area would greatly benefit from.

'I think the property would be of particular interest to general investors; for one, it is of great historical significance to the area and needs to be preserved. At the same time, there is great investment potential.'

The property's price is less than many garages are now sold for in central and north London. The auction is set for February 25.

Auctioneers say the building offers great potential to investors due to its relatively low asking price and historical significance

Many of the building's stained-glass windows remain preserved, although the interior of the building will need considerable work

The planning permission means the property will be able to be converted, although the listed status of the church means conditions will apply
