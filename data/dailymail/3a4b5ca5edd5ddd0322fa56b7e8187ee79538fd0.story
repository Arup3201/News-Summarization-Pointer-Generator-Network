An aunt chopped off her six-year-old nephew's ears in a chilling assault to exact revenge on his father because he wouldn't lend her money in China.

The innocent boy suffered horrific scarring to his face and jaw when 35-year-old Zhang Qihui launched the attack in rural Wanghe Village in Hubei Province, central China.

It is the second such incident in six months to send shockwaves through China after a woman gauged out the eyes of her six-year-old nephew Bin Bin in Shanxi province last August.

Shocking: A photograph of the unidentified victim of the most recent attack, with gaping injuries and blood on his face, almost immediately went viral on Chinese social networking sites sparking shock and anger among the country's online community

A photograph of the unidentified victim of the most recent attack, with gaping injuries and blood on his face,  almost immediately went viral on Chinese social networking sites sparking shock and anger among the country's online community.

The victim's father, whose name was not released, told Chinese media he had refused to lend money to his younger brother - Zhang's husband - who wanted to build a house.

He said Zhang lured his son down an alleyway before attacking him with a fruit knife.

The boy was rushed to hospital where surgeons managed to reattach one of his ears. The other, however, was too badly damaged and had to be discarded.

One online commenter wrote: 'How could someone have done this to a little boy who had nothing to do with adults' dispute?'

Zhang is now in custody and an investigation is under way, police added.

The case echoes that of Bin Bin who was reported missing while playing outside 
his house on the afternoon of 24 August last year. He was later found drugged and covered in 
blood by family members some three to four hours later.

'He had blood all over his face. His eyelids were turned inside out. 
And inside, his eyeballs were not there,' his devastated father told 
Shanxi Television reporters.

The childâ€™s eyes were found nearby but the corneas were missing, sparking rumours that he may have been attacked by organ traffickers.

'Don't cry. Don't cry and I won't gouge out your eyes,' the kidnapper allegedly told him.

But within days it was revealed his aunt was in fact behind the assault having gone through a psychotic episode.

She killed herself three days later.

Months later, Bin Bin was fitted with prosthetic eyeballs by a doctor at
 a hospital in the southern boom town of Shenzhen.
