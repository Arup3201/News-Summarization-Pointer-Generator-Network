A California  builder has transformed part of his home into a fantasy feline adventure land.

Peter Cohen, co-founder of Trillium Enterprises, lives in a 3000-square-foot cat castle in Santa Barbara, and has built 150 feet of catwalks, spiral staircases, tunnels, perches and all manner of cool kitty accessories to accommodate his cat companions.

Mr Cohen, who grew up as a dog-lover, turned into a cat fan after he purchased the Goleta, California house in 1988.

Feline fantasy: Peter Cohen started Trillium Enterprises and used his construction prowess to build his house to his cat's liking

On the catwalk: Mr Cohen estimates that he spent between $40,000 and $50,000 on the cat shelves, of which there are more than 150 feet

The property came with two outdoor cats. However, one cat was killed and the other badly injured after both were hit by cars, so he and his partner decided to adopt a new cat from the local shelter to keep the injured pet company.

From that point, they just kept adopting cats, a couple more every few years.

He has added a floor to what used to be a 1600-square-foot house and now shares his four-bedroom home with Cheesecake, Charlie, Nutter, Butter, Crumple, Rumple, Cookie, Poppyseed, Mary, Secret, Wasabi, Kiro, Coffee Bean and Donut

The cat lover and his partner Manuel Flores currently only adopt from shelters and try to take cats other people do not want, most often black cats and cats with bent tails.

Cat-man: Although he grew up a dog lover, Mr Cohen inherited two cats in 1988 when he bought his house

Mr Cohen, his partner Manuel Flores, and their roommate Hiro Furumoto live with 14 cats, though they have had as many as 18

Mr Cohen first began installing catwalks in his house in 1995 and has added to his creations over the years

They have had as many as 18 but currently have 14 feline housemates - having lost four cats this year to age and disease. They also have a human housemate - Hiro Furumoto.

The pussycat pad started out with the installation of catwalks in 1995 after Mr Cohen was inspired by Bob Walker's book The Cat's House, according to Zeezoey.

He admits he has spent between $40,000 and $50,000 on the catwalks alone. 

No expense was spared for his feline friends - even though the alterations could technically have been done cheaper.

'At a certain point there was not turning back. It was like, this is their house and we're living here with them' Mr Flores told Houzz TV.

Mr Flores, Mr Furumoto and Mr Cohen try to find one-on-one time to spend with the cats, who are rarely all in the same room together. Additionally, some prefer to be left alone. 

The humans of the house say that they also appreciate the catwalks as a form of architectural beauty

The house was originally 1600-square-feet, but Mr Cohen has made improvements including a second story and ventilated litter rooms

But Mr Cohen says he gets enjoyment from his cat-clogged house beyond just feline companionship.

He says: 'The catwalks are for the cats but they're also for me. They're architecturally interesting to me in the colors and we always try to do something interesting with the shapes.'

Mr Cohen says he has received numerous calls about how best to design catwalks.

The builder was unsure whether his pets would use the catwalks when he first built them, but now the animals can be heard scampering around on the ledges at odd hours of the night. 

'Our house was built for us AND our cats. The catwalks are fun for the cats, giving them lots of places to explore, hang out, etc,' he said.

The cats are particularly interested in a koi pond that Mr Cohen built, though they have never eaten one of the fish. 

Soothing music also plays in the house almost all the time, according to Catster.

The home builder's construction experience helped him make his house practical as well.

'I am a general contractor and wanted to create an environment that was good for both cats and humans. The fact that the litter boxes are in ventilated closets helps keep odors out of the house,' he said.

The humans are aided in picking up the cats fur by five Roomba automatic vacuums.  

But the animal-lover isn't done purrfecting his house yet.

'We always have new catwalks on the drawing boards and will add them as time/money allow,' Mr Cohen said.

He added said that despite the abundance of stimulating objects and rooms in his house, his cats still love to climb inside old boxes.
