A pair of allegedly boozy bosom buddies who were arrested when one drove drunk to fetch the other from the police station, and then called a third sloshed friend to pick them up, have been pictured.

The hat-trick of DUIs started with 34-year-old Carmen Reatequi, of Whitehouse Station, New Jersey, who was pulled over by a patrolman for swerving on Route 22 East about 1.45am on Monday.

After a standardized field sobriety test, Reatequi was arrested and taken to Readington police headquarters, according to NJ.com.

Dumb and dumber: The hat-trick of DUIs started with 34-year-old Carmen Reatequi, right, who then called Nina Petracca, 23, left, to pick her up, but she was also arrested for DUI

She was charged with driving while under the influence of alcohol, failure to stay in her lane and failure to provide a vehicle insurance card.

Enter: Nina Petracca.

Reatequi then called a friend Nina Petracca, 23, of Dunellen for a ride, however she showed signs of intoxication while officers were explaining the potential liability form.

She was made to do sobriety tests in the lobby and failed.

Petracca was arrested for DUI, and a 
search of her purse revealed seven Vicodin in an unlabeled container, 
leading to other charges for possession and driving while in possession 
of a controlled substance.

Enter: Ryan Hogan.

Later both drivers called Ryan Hogan, 33, of Whitehouse Station.

Police Sgt. Carlos Ferreiro detected the smell of alcohol.

DUI: Reatequi, right, was charged with driving while under the influence of alcohol, failure to stay in her lane and failure to provide a vehicle insurance card before Petracca, left, arrived

Scene: Carmen Reategui, 34, of Whitehouse Station, was pulled over here, on Route 22 east at Route 523 in Readington, New Jersey, about 1.45am Monday

'When I was outside talking to him he displayed signs of intoxication,' Ferreiro told the New York Daily News.

Hogan then underwent a field sobriety test and also failed, before he was charged with DUI.

All three were released into the custody of an adult, this one thankfully hadn't been drinking.

'They finally got a sober adult to come pick up all three of them,' Ferreiro said. 'It's the first time in nine years I've had something like this.'

The trio will appear in court in January.

Later, Reategui posted on Facebook: 'Just getting home.., ABSOLUTELY THE WORST NIGHT OF MY F—–G LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'

A subsequent post read: 'Heavy….heavy heart. Wish there was an undo button in life.'

Perhaps bad news really does come in threes?
