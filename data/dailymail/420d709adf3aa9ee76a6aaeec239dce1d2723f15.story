Toy giant Lego has come under fire from parents after publishing an article in its own-brand magazine which offered a range of 'insulting' beauty tips to young girls.

The March/April edition of the Lego Club Magazine included a feature called 'Emma's Beauty Tips', which suggested that young girls who are 'ready to change up their looks' should consider opting for a more flattering haircut that would better suit their face shape.

'You, yes you, are beautiful, but if you're ready to change up your look, read on for some tips and tricks on how to get the best haircut for the shape of your face,' the article reads.

Outrage: This 'beauty tips' feature in the March/April edition of the Lego Club Magazine has caused fury among parents

The feature then lists five different face shapes, from 'heart faces' to 'oval faces', suggesting which type of hair cut would be bested suited to each shape. 

And while those with heart-shaped faces are advised to choose 'long, curly layers and thinned out curls' in order to accentuate their 'angular cheeks', those with oval faces are told that they are lucky enough to be able to 'have almost any style haircut' because 'almost everything looks great on this face shape'. 

Unsurprisingly, the article has hit a nerve with parents of the young girls reading the magazine - with one mother, Cleveland-based writer Sharon Holbrook, writing a piece for the New York Times slamming the magazine's 'insulting' feature. 

'[My daughter] is seven,' she wrote. 'My little girl, the shape of her face, and whether her haircut is flattering are none of Lego’s concern,'  It wasn’t even her concern until a toy magazine told her to start worrying about it.'

Mrs Holbrook goes on to quote from the Lego Friends website, which states that the range is aimed at children between the ages of five and 12 who are, she writes, 'far too young' to be told that their face shape might mean they need a new haircut in order to 'soften the edges' of their faces. 

Unnecessary: The 'overtly girly' Lego Friends line, including this Heartlake Hair Salon, has previously come under fire from parents for suggesting that young girls should not be playing with traditional Lego models

The online article has prompted a flurry of furious activity on social media, with parents across the country calling for Lego to abandon its 'sexist' marketing campaigns and 'overtly girly' toy ranges in favor of returning to the 'powerful messages' it once offered to  young girls who were so eager to play with their products. 

'Go back to this [message] of 1981 instead of "beauty tips for 5-12 year-olds" c**p,' one person wrote on Twitter, alongside a picture of a 30-year-old Lego ad campaign which encouraged young girls to 'build for fun'. 

Another added: 'Nonononono. Damn it, LEGO. Girls don't need another source of beauty tips, let alone from you.' 

One parent went as far as to say she would boycott Lego until the brand does something to address its 'sexist' campaigns, tweeting: 'Hey @LEGO_Group, your sexism is getting out of control. I’m buying @Tegu blocks until you check it (sic).'

'The ultra-girly Lego Friends line caused a flap from the beginning, and I wasn’t at all sure whether I liked it,' Mrs Holbrook added. 

'Why can’t girls and boys both play with traditional Legos? When I was little, Lego used to even market them to all children, magnificently so...' 

Go back: Parents are calling for Lego to return to the positive messages it once sent out to young girls, such as the one in this ad campaign from 1981

Fury: Many parents have taken to social media to express their outrage and disappointment at the overtly 'sexist' Lego Friends line

In a statement provided to Mashable, Lego spokesman Michael McNally insisted that the copmany was taking onboard all of the feedback offered by 'readers', adding that the brand 'sincerely regrets' any offense caused by the feature. 

'Our Club team is always striving for new ways to engage with Lego fans based on insights we gather from our Club audience,' Mr McNally said. 

'One particular thing that readers asked us to include was an "Advice Column". In the most recent magazine, we attempted to deliver against this request by elaborating on a current Lego Friends story line. 

'We sincerely regret any disappointment it may have caused. We value this feedback and have already shared with the Lego Club team in order to positively impact future stories.'

It is not the first time that the Lego Friends line, the range of toys on which the beauty tips article was based, has come under heavy criticism from parents. 

Shortly after the range debuted in 2011, many people spoke out to express concern about its seemingly sexist suggestion that young girls needed their own line of feminine toys, rather than being able to play with the traditional building blocks also used by boys. 

Instead of the more conventional themes many associate with Lego blocks, the Lego Friends line focuses on shopping, beauty products, homemaking and cooking.
