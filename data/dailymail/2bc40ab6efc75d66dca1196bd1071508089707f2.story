Two female teachers have taken stress leave as while an investigation into the allegations is ongoing

Five boys from a prestigious Catholic college in Sydney are being investigated by police for sharing sexual images of two female teachers on social media.

The students, who attend St Augustine's College at Brookvale on city's northern beaches, allegedly used iPhones to photograph and video up teachers' skirts before uploading the content to a specially created thread on Facebook, Fairfax Media reported.

While the principal of the college, Tim Cleary, would not comment on disciplinary matters involving students, it is understood the boys received suspensions only to be allowed back after taking re-enrollment interviews.

It is understood the female teachers implicated in the criminal activity are on stress leave.

One parent, who wished not to be identified, said she felt 'totally disgusted' that the students were allowed to take re-enrollment interviews as part of their return to school.

She said: 'I do not want my year nine son at school with these sorts of boys.'

'I am outraged that these boys have returned to the school.'

Head of school at St Augustine's College, Matthew Hutchison, said the behaviour of the students was 'calculated', and in a statement said the teachers had been 'betrayed' by the boys' criminal activity.

Fairfax Media reported that the students had been capturing the images for several months.

'This incident has caused a great deal of hurt for everyone involved and I imagine all of you are extremely angered with the ill-treatment of your colleagues,' Mr Hutchison's statement said.

He said that upon discovering the 'critical incident', the college immediately contacted police to seek advice.

A police spokesperson has confirmed with Daily Mail Australia that an investigation is underway.

'Police are investigating an incident at a school on Sydney's northern beaches. As the investigation is ongoing it is inappropriate to comment further.'

Mr Hutchison said the boys' actions had caused the teachers 'incredible hurt and distress'.
