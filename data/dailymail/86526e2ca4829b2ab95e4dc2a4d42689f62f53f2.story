Embarrassing: Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) boss Sir Ian Andrews has resigned after it was revealed he breached its code of conduct

Dozens of major firms linked to rogue private investigators could be named following the resignation of the official who has protected their identities.

Sir Ian Andrews stepped down from his role as chairman of the Serious Organised Crime Agency after breaching its code of conduct.

The former Ministry of Defence mandarin failed to declare his interest in a consultancy firm he set up with his wife. His sudden move raises hopes that a potentially incendiary list of 102 names held by Soca could finally be made public.

MPs on the home affairs committee are angry that the companies and individuals have escaped scrutiny or criminal investigation. Reacting to Sir Ian’s resignation last night, the committee’s chairman Keith Vaz said the decision to keep the list secret could be overturned.

‘Sir Ian was part of the decision making process that required the home affairs select committee kept the lists Soca sent us confidential,’ said the Labour MP.

‘I shall be writing to his successor to ask if he or she will now review this decision. Having lost its chairman, Soca is clearly a troubled organisation. With it due to be abolished in nine weeks’ time, it is important we clear up all outstanding issues as a matter of urgency.’

In a letter to Mr Vaz, Sir Ian said he had ‘no alternative’ but to resign from the £65,000-a-year part-time role. He said the ‘oversight’ came to light after he was grilled by MPs over his role in the Soca secrecy scandal last month.

He added: ‘I have failed to maintain the standard of integrity to be expected of the head of a public body, let alone one charged with law enforcement.’

Sir Ian went on: ‘I have no  explanation other than it was  both a genuine and unintentional oversight but it is nonetheless inexcusable, and the responsibility is mine alone.’

SOCA has attracted criticism for its lack of transparency from senior MPs who are investigating the scandal

The resignation is an ignominious end to a role that began in ridicule when Sir Ian was accused of being a ‘Yes Minister’ appointment.

He admitted having no direct experience of policing or law enforcement when he was appointed in 2009 after retiring from the civil service.

Until last month he remained largely in the shadows as he steadied Soca after years of criticism of its poor performance, low morale and unnecessary secrecy.

Decision: Reacting to Sir Ian's resignation last night, the committee's chairman Keith Vaz said the decision to keep the list secret could be overturned

It will be transformed into the National Crime Agency in October under new leadership with a wider remit to tackle organised crime.

Under questioning by MPs, Sir Ian was accused of keeping secret a report about blue chip companies fuelling an underworld trade in illegal information.

The dossier from 2008 highlighted how blagging, hacking and stealing private data was rife outside the media but was not considered by the Leveson Inquiry. After his appearance before MPs, Sir Ian, 59, was accused of failing to declare that his wife is a leading figure in the private investigations industry.

Moira Andrews, 54, is a senior lawyer for G3 Good Governance Group, a global security and investigations firm.

Sir Ian insisted yesterday that there was no conflict of interest, but said he later realised he failed to declare their joint company to his employer. Sir Ian and his wife set up Abis Partnership Ltd, a ‘legal activities’ firm registered at a mail box address in Cheshire, in February 2012.

Companies House records disclose few details about its work. Sir Ian said it is a vehicle to supply management consultancy services to clients that he did declare.

The Soca register of interests shows Sir Ian as working for the Ministry of Defence, Department of Health, Foreign Office and Transparency International.
