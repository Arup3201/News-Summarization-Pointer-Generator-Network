The mother of a childhood friend of virgin killer Elliot Rodger has today told of her daughter's 'total shock' at being named in his bitter manifesto.

Rodger, 22, first met the girl, the daughter of a British 1980s popstar, when he moved to California aged five - but in his twisted rant he said she came to 'represent everything I hate and despise.'

And clearly shaken, her mother told MailOnline at her home: 'It's a nightmare, she's shocked. The Rodger family are very dear friends of ours. I cannot believe what they are going through. They gave that boy everything. Everything he needed. He was everything to them.'

Distraught: The mother of a childhood friend of Virgin killer Elliot Rodger railed against in his manifesto today said her daughter was in 'total shock'

'I have spoken to them and out of respect I do not want to say anything.'

However, she added: 'Our hearts are full of kindness and empathy for everyone affected.'

In his manifesto, written shortly before he went on a rampage and 
killed six students at the University of California, Rodger went on a 
tirade about the girl who was his first friend in Los Angeles.

She is one of many girls, men and parents who Rodger spewed hatred at as he wrote his sick manifesto in a twisted bid to justify his horrific actions.

During their childhood, he claimed the pair were close, even sharing baths 
together as the two families socialised at parties and barbecues at each
 other’s houses.

But as the pretty blonde grew into a sociable college student, Elliot became a troubled recluse.

Rodger wrote of the girl: ‘I was a 5 year old boy playing with a girl my own age like any normal boy would do.

‘I was enjoying life in a world that I loved. I
 was happy, and completely oblivious of the fact that my future on this 
world would only turn to darkness and misery because of girls.

‘This girl who was my friend, (she) would eventually come to represent everything I hate and despise; everything that is against me, and 
everything that I'm against. I was playing innocently with this girl, in
 the manner that all children play. We even took baths together; it was 
the only time in my life that I would see a girl my age naked.'

Enacting
 his 'revenge' on society, Rodger stabbed three of his housemates to death at his home
 before shooting dead two sorority sisters and another male student in 
Santa Barbara on Friday.

London-born
 Rodger was raised in West Sussex, England, attending £18,000-a-year prep 
school Dorset House, before moving to California with his parents, Hunger Games director Peter Rodger and his ex-wife Chin,

His former friend also emigrated to LA as a child after her father hit the big time with his band.

Rodger, son of Hunger Games assistant director Peter Rodger, regularly went to her home.

The two stayed in touch through their families until August last year when she went to his house for dinner.

However,
 he later stalked her on Facebook and concluded that she and her friends
 at the University of Southern California were 'spoiled.'

He
 wrote: 'I would take great delight in torturing and flaying her and 
every single one of her spoiled, obnoxious, evil friends.'

The girl's stepfather also added: 'We are absolutely devastated. It is a tragedy that so many young lives have been lost. Our thoughts are with their families. The Rodgers are good people. I knew Elliot as well. It is just incredibly sad.

'Now I just want to protect my daughter and do what is best for her.'

Rodger, who had Asperger's Syndrome, emailed his manifesto to his parents and his psychiatrist before going on the rampage in Santa Barbara.

First he stabbed to death his fellow students Weihan Wang, 20, and Cheng Yuan Hong, 20, at their shared apartment. The body of another student, George Chen, 19, was also found there.

His next victims were Veronica Weiss, 19, and Katherine Cooper, 22, both shot outside a student house near the campus.

He then drove in his black BMW 3 Series to a grocery store and opened fire, killing his sixth victim, English major Christopher Michael-Martinez, 20.

Today, family friend and spokesman Simon Astaire said the Rodger family are 'grieving for those innocents who lost their lives, above their own son'.

Mr Astaire has spent the last few days with Chin, Peter and his second wife Soumaya and he says they are so upset they can 'barely string a sentence together'.

He said: 'They are absolutely crippled
 by grief. I know them very well and it is incredibly hard to be in 
their company, because they are so distraught. It is hard to be near 
them because they are so devastated.

'I
 can tell you that they are grieving for those who've lost their lives 
before their own son. They really are, that's where they are. I can't 
imagine the confusion there must be in that?'

As well as launching a tirade against his childhood friend, Rodger also branded model Monette Moio an 'evil b****' and blamed her for his hatred of women.

He claimed the stunning blonde 'teased and ridiculed' him after they met at school, sparking his vendetta against female kind.

'The way I was treated by 
girls at this time, especially by that evil b**** sparked 
an intense fear of girls,' he wrote.

'The funny part of this is that I had a secret 
crush on Monette. She was the first girl I ever had a crush on, and I 
never admitted it to anyone

However,
 Monette's father, Hollywood stuntman John Moio, has defended his 
daughter, saying it is ridiculous to even suggest she played a part in 
Rodger's spiral into a mass murderer.

Speaking from his home in West Hills, 
California, he told MailOnline: 'She was ten years old for God's sake - 
she can barely remember the guy. He's a sociopath. She hasn't seen him 
since school.'

'She's 
devastated over the whole thing,' he went on. 'It's like she's being 
implicated in this terrible tragedy for something she hasn't done and 
can't remember.'

He added that Rodger's claims that Monette had 'teased' him were impossible.

'How
 is a ten-year-old girl going to bully a 12-year-old boy?' he asked. 
'Maybe the girls she hung around with did poke fun at him, but they were
 kids.

'My daughter was not a bully, she's 
one of the sweetest people you could ever meet. She probably rejected 
his aggressive advances. If you want to call that bullying then fine.'

Mr Moio added that he and his daughter only remember Rodger as a 'strange kid'.

'He
 was weird then and he's weird now,' he said. 'He had a secret crush on 
her, but she was completely unaware of him. She had no idea... If you think about it, he could have killed her, he could have come after her.

'I was hands on at that school and I 
don't remember him. She just remember that he was a strange kid, she 
knew he wasn't a normal type person, but there are a lot of people like 
that at that age.'

But he added that his sympathy was with 
Rodger's parents - who alerted the police to the manifesto after they 
received a copy - and for the six young victims. He also had some 
sympathy for the killer.

'I also feel sorry for him because he 
obviously wasn't getting the proper help,' he said. 'From what I 
understand he was receiving psychological help two years before he met 
my daughter. I am not here to judge anyone.'

He added: 'My heart goes out to the victims' families. God bless them.'
