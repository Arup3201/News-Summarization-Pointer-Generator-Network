New Jersey Republican Governor Chris Christie broke his day-long silence Wednesday afternoon to say that a petty plan to exact revenge against a Democratic mayor by bottling up traffic in his town was carried out 'without my knowledge.'

Christie put out a strongly-worded statement aimed at distancing himself from the growing scandal that threatens to engulf him and put the brakes on his presidential ambitions.

'What I've seen today for the first time is unacceptable,' Christie said. 'I am outraged and deeply saddened to learn that not only was I misled by a member of my staff, but this completely inappropriate and unsanctioned conduct was made without my knowledge.'

Shocking emails released hours earlier revealed Christie's aides punished a Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich for refusing to endorse their boss by snarling commuter traffic entering his town's on-ramp to New York City's busy George Washington Bridge.

'One thing is clear: this type of 
behavior is unacceptable,' he said, 'and I will not tolerate it because 
the people of New Jersey deserve better. This behavior is not 
representative of me or my Administration in any way, and people will be
 held responsible for their actions.'

But Christie had downplayed the episode to the Newark Star-Ledger in December, it emerged today.

'I
 don’t ever remember even meeting the mayor of Fort Lee and I certainly 
don’t remember getting any briefings at any time from campaign staff 
that this was someone who was on our radar screen as a potential 
endorser,' Christie said at the time.

'That’s
 why none of this makes any sense to me and I think in the end what it 
will be shown to be is rank speculation from folks who want to play 
political games.'

The
 governor's office's involvement in the petty exercise of political 
power during a tense re-election campaign has been big news in the 
Garden State since before Christie won a second term as governor.

But a raft of electronic messages
 subpoenaed from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey by the 
New Jersey Assembly's Transportation Committee revealed explosive details of the 
plot today.

Emails and instant messages between 
Christie deputy chief of staff Bridget Anne Kelly and two appointees at 
the Port Authority revealed a calculated effort to retaliate against 
Sokolich by closing off lanes leading to the bridge.

'Time
 for some traffic problems in Fort Lee,' Kelly wrote weeks before the 
event, suggesting the development of a long-term plan for vindictive 
political payback.

'Got it,' responded David Wildstein, a Christie ally who served as a Port Authority official until his resignation – unrelated to the bridge mini-scandal, the Christie administration has insisted – in early December.

The Christie administration would later claim that forcing three lanes of the bridge into a single toll booth was the result of a mismanaged traffic study supervised by Wildstein. 

Kelly kicked off the traffic shenanigans with a gleeful email to a Port Authority official on August 13, subpoenaed documents show

Texts between two Christie aides depict a callous attitude toward the traffic chaos they caused, including a swipe at children of voters who supported Christie's gubernatorial candidate, Barbara Buono

But the trove of emails and other 
messages, obtained by several news outlets on Wednesday, show that the 
governor's appointees reveled in their accomplishment and later 
expressed shock when Port Authority officials in New York restored the 
Fort Lee traffic.

'The New York side gave Fort Lee back all three lanes this morning. We are appropriately going nuts', Wildstein wrote to Kelly.

Mark Sokolich, mayor of Fort Lee, N.J., found his town's traffic backed up because he refused to endorse Christ Christie's re-election bid last year

'What??' she responded in an email.

'Yes, unreal. Fixed now,' Wildstein responded.

After
 Mayor Sokolich complained to the Port Authority that the traffic jam 
was keeping children from reaching schools on their bus routes, 
Wildstein asked in an instant message, 'Is it wrong that I am smiling,'

'No,' came the reply from the recipient.

'I feel badly about the kids ... I guess,' wrote Wildstein.

'They are children of Buono voters,' his unidentified texting partner answered.

Barbara Buono was the Democrats' failed gubernatorial candidate who garnered Sokolich's endorsement.

She told The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday that the flap represented 'a clear abuse of power. This is what is being inflicted on the people of New Jersey.'

Christie
 won the support of several prominent Democratic politicians in his 
state, in an effort to demonstrate his ability to build bipartisan 
support and reach across the political aisle.

That quality, a Republican strategist told MailOnline on Wednesday, 'will be critical if Christie has any chance at winning the presidency as a Republican in 2016.'

Not-so-EZ-Pass: When three toll lanes originating in Fort Lee were suddenly forced to merge into one in September, traffic snarled for a week until authorities in New York City reversed the New Jersey officials' order

'He's already lost the party's right 
wing,' the long-time operative said. 'So he needs moderates, and maybe 
to create a new kind of Reagan Democrat, if he's going to have any 
chance of beating Hillary Clinton.'

He
 cited Christie's public embrace of President Barack Obama following 
Superstorm Sandy in 2012, and his signature this week on legislation 
extending DREAM Act-like benefits to some illegal immigrants, among 
problems that conservatives will raise.

In a sign of an administration suddenly thrown into confusion by the simmering scandal, Christie abruptly canceled his only scheduled public appearance on Wednesday.

He was to make a Hurricane Sandy 'housing recovery milestone announcement.'
