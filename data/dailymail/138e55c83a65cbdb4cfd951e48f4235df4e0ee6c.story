Christopher Michael East is alleged to have beat his neighbor, 75, for cutting his nails outside their apartment building

A 75-year-old man was allegedly beaten over the head with a baseball bat for cutting his nails on the steps of his apartment building.

Bill Newell was sat outside his home in Naples, Florida, when he was allegedly approached by Christopher Michael East, his 39-year-old neighbor.

East is said to have told Mr Newell to 'get off his stairs', but he refused, continuing to sit on the steps and clip his nails 'because he lives in the building'.

Mr Newell was then struck from behind, inflicting a large gash on the top of his head.

Police officers found the pensioner lying bloodied in the fetal position, with the baseball bat a few feet away. 

He also had bruised legs, a bruised back and his manicure set had been stolen, the Naples Daily News reported.

He spent eight hours being treated at North Naples Hospital on Tuesday but  the next day said he was doing 'OK'.

'When someone beats you up with a baseball bat, you don't recover right away,' Mr Newell said. 

Before the alleged attack, Mr Newell said he had one previous encounter with East.

Last year, Mr Newell said he went upstairs to East's apartment to inquire about his Comcast television reception. When he answered, Newell said East curtly told him he had DIRECTV and promptly slammed the door.

East is facing charges of aggravated battery using a deadly weapon and unarmed robbery. 

Mr Newell said: 'I just want to let the courts take care of everything.'
