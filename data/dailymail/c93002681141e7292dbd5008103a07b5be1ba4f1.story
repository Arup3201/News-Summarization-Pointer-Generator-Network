In a quiet corner of north west London, Dereck Chisora is finalising his preparations for his heavyweight rematch with Tyson Fury.

Chisora spends 45 minutes training in front of the watching media, looking considerably slimmer than the man who lost to Fury three years ago.

In the background, the dulcet tones of the Bee Gees provide a rather sharp contrast to a man intent on causing destruction.

Chisora is a man who divides opinion.

One on hand, he gave Vitali Klitschko a torrid time over 12 rounds in February in 2012.

But an hour later he was involved in a disgraceful brawl with David Haye at the post-fight press conference.

Since losing to Haye five months later, however, and after a heart-to-heart with his mum, Chisora overhauled his training regime and put together a run of five consecutive victories.

He has been preparing to take on Fury at a training camp near Ben Nevis in Scotland, where he was pictured going shooting last week.

Chisora appeared in good spirits, and seemed relaxed at one of Scotland's most picturesque surroundings.

But here, three days out from the fight, he is in one of his surly moods.

'I'm in a better place than the first fight,' he said.

'I'm more mature and more experienced. I'm a dad now and there's nothing better in the world than being a dad.

'I've been working on being more mobile and I want to get the fight rolling.

'The way I've got this fight planned out, by round seven he'll be 5ft 5in.

'I'm in my prime; heavyweights peak in their 30s and that's what's happening to me now.

'It's going to be a great fight.'

Thankfully for Dereck Chisora, words are not all he has.
