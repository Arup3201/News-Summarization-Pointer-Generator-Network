When Kelly and Sharon Osbourne announced that they were unveiling a 26-piece make-up range for MAC Cosmetics, beauty aficionados couldn't control their excitement. 

And now, the mother-daughter duo are preparing for a stampede as they get set to unveil their new beauty range in the UK early next week. And if that wasn't enough, they're coming to London to share their beauty tricks, too.

The collection is a vibrant selection of statement-making hues for eyes, lips, face and nails and the range is encased in limited-edition packaging inspired by the duo's signature red and violet colour palettes.

It's finally here! Kelly, 29, and Sharon Osbourne, 61, have unveiled their range for MAC and will be coming to London to show beauty buffs how to copy their signature looks

Kelly, 29, took to her website to reveal how excited she was about the big launch.

She wrote: 'It is such an honor for both me and my mother to be the first mother daughter duo to design our individual collections for MAC Cosmetics.

'Ever since I can remember, MAC has been my favorite make-up, not only for their wide range of colors but their ingenuity and forward thinking and how they are able to change public perception through the use of make-up.

'I had so much fun working with the MAC team, playing with pigments and learning what really goes into makeup, because let’s think about it Ladies and Gentlemen ;) … we put make-up on our face almost everyday, we should know what’s in it.

Behind the scenes: Kelly has admitted that she is the inspiration behind the range because she wanted to create a collection that she would love and wear herself

A hard day in the office: Sharon, 61, looks better than ever as she has her make-up applied whilst enjoying a nice glass of champagne backstage on the shoot

'It was 
really important while designing this collection that I stayed true to 
myself while creating fashion forward pigments that applied the right 
way would look amazing on almost every woman of every color and every 
size.'

The Fashion Police host has also revealed the inspiration behind the range to be none other than herself!

Speaking 
to ET Fashion, she said: 'I keep giggling when I say this because I was 
my inspiration, and I know it's really narcissistic to say but I wanted 
to stay true to me and the colours I love, but at the same time, kind of
 slightly tweaking them a bit so they're a bit more for every woman 
because I know my taste isn't for everyone.

Joking around: The Fashion Police presenter and her mother mess around backstage on the shoot for their beauty range

'So I had to leave my ego at the door with this, and really think about it.'

The line, which includes make-up tools, a mineralized face duo, lip pencils, eyeliner and blusher, comes in bright and pastel shades (courtesy of Kelly), while Sharon champions deep bronzes and dark red shades.

Sharon, 61, and daughter Kelly are even coming to Selfridges in London on Monday to offer their best beauty advice as part of the store's Beauty Project.

They will join MAC Senior Artists John Stapleton and
 Neil Young at an exclusive 
demonstration where they will share how to achieve their signature 
looks.

Beauty buffs will be treated to a preview of the range on Monday for the event and then it launches nationwide on June 10.
