A nuclear power station in Kent has been leaking radioactive waste, which can increase the risk of developing cancer, for months according to the Environment Agency.

Routine tests on boreholes drilled close to the Dungeness B plant found traces of tritium measuring more than seven times the agreed level.

But plant owners EDF Energy have reassured residents that it is unlikely that contaminated water has seeped into the local domestic supply.

Leak: The Dungeness B power station n Kent has been leaking more than the agreed levels of tritium

Although the substance, a radioactive variant of hydrogen, can increase the risk of cancer, according to the Environmental Protection Agency in the US, it is considered one of the least dangerous nuclear waste products.

Normal levels of tritium, agreed with the Environment Agency and measured in Becquerels, are usually considered to be anything under 100 per litre of water.

But the tests in the boreholes close to Dungeness B showed levels of 760.

The Environment Agency said: 'EDF informed the Environment Agency and the Office for Nuclear Regulation in September 2012 and in December 2012 that they had monitored elevated levels of tritium in the groundwater on the Dungeness B nuclear licensed site.

'Dungeness B is a significant distance from any boreholes used for drinking water abstraction. As a precaution, the local water authority has been informed of the results.

'EDF are conducting an investigation into the source of the tritium. Any regulatory response will be informed by the results of this investigation.'

Owner: EDF Energy says that work is well underway to rectify the tritium levels

The Evironment Agency confirmed that levels of tritium were normal elsewhere in Dungeness B's surroundings and added that the power station is allowed to discharge tritium in the environment under permit.

The World Health Organisations's guideline level for the maximum amount of tritium in drinking water is 10,000 Becquerels per litre.

Tritium can inhaled, ingested and even absorbed through the skin and is a naturally occuring form of hydrogen found in the environment anyway.

A spokesman for EDF Energy said: 'We take our responsibilities to the environment very seriously. At our sites we continually strive to improve our environmental performance by adopting best practice.

'We routinely monitor, record and report on our environmental discharges and sample our water.

Out of action: The Dungeness A power station, pictured in late 2005, ceased operation in 2006. Normal levels of tritium have been monitored elsewhere around the site

'Samples analysed during routine quarterly sampling of groundwater at Dungeness B indicated levels of tritium above the agreed Environmental Agency investigation level of 100Bq/l. This has been identified and isolated to one small area on site.

'Work is well underway to resolve this issue and the Environment Agency and Office for Nuclear Regulation site inspectors are being kept informed of the progress being made. The Dungeness Site Stakeholder Group is also being kept informed.

'The environmental impact is negligible and there is no risk to the public or our employees.

'Tritium levels in boreholes on the station boundary have been checked and confirmed to be at background levels and the local water company has confirmed that the local water system is unaffected.'

The company added that drinking two litres of water containing a concentration of 850 Becquerels per litre of Tritium would result in less than 0.1 per cent of the average annual radiation dose received per person in the UK.

This is the equivalent of eating two medium-sized baked potatoes everyday for a year.

Dungeness B is two advanced gas cooled reactors which began operations in 1983 and 1985. It remains operational after Dungeness A was closed in 2006.

Even if it had, the levels detected would pose no danger to the public
