Closed case: Authorities identified 44-year-old remains as those of Elizabeth Ernstein, who vanished in 1968

The remains of a young female body found in a shallow grave in 1969 have been identified as those of a 14-year-old girl who vanished a year before, in 1968.

Cold case detectives announced yesterday that they identified the remains of Elizabeth Ernstein through DNA matching.

The teenager vanished in March of 1968 while walking home from school, and left no clues as to what happened.

The case of the missing girl sparked national attention as Ernstein’s parents launched a desperate search for their young daughter.

Her parents, Ruth and Norman Ernstein, spent thousands of dollars in the months following their daughter’s disappearance to alert the media of Elizabeth’s story.

Mrs Ernsteine told a newspaper in December of 1968: ‘I can face the daytime better than the night,’ adding, ‘At night, I find myself asking: is she safe? Is she warm? Is she being fed? And finally…is she alive?’

A coroner’s personal statement issued Friday read: ‘The case took on national attention with news media covering the story from across the nation. Her disappearance went unsolved.’

Sent out: Ernstein's parents Norman and Ruth, centre right and far right, sent out 10,200 letters to newspapers throughout the U.S. and Canada in hopes of finding their daughter

Fated afternoon: She was walking back from Moore Junior High School in Redlands, only two miles from her house, but never returned home

According to the Redlands-LomaLinda Patch, the unidentified remains were exhumed in 2011 and DNA tested. Authorities knew the body belonged to a young person, but had few other leads.

It wasn’t until this year that detectives tested Ernstein’s siblings for a possible DNA match.

Desperate: Ernstein's family offered thousands of dollars in reward money for any information

The coroner’s report states that her siblings’ DNA was a match to the remains found in the shallow grave in 1969.

Investigators did not reveal how Ernstein died, but they said that it is a murder case.

On March 18, 1968, Ernstein was walking home from Moore Junior High School in Redlands, California.

She was wearing a khaki jacket, blue dress, tennis shoes, and a gold necklace with a blue star, according to reports at the time.

Her walk should have been a peaceful one – she lived two miles away, and her closest route was through an orange grove.

But Ernstein never returned home. 

Her disappearance was one that would haunt Redlands for decades. Mrs Ernstein once said the months of uncertainty ‘are the deepest anguish a person can go through. It’s a shock so deep – you become wooden.’

Mr Ernstein added: ‘This is the second tragedy in our lives, is even greater because of the uncertainty. I can accept anything, even the worst, which I’m resigned to, but I must know.’

In 1952, the couple lost a son to polio.

Always searching: The Ernsteins sent out 10,200 letters to newspapers around the country, garnering national attention

Mr Ernstein worked as a chemical engineer for Lockheed, and his wife worked as a psychiatric social worker.

At the time, they had posted a $5,000 reward for any information concerning their daughter’s whereabouts.

They also sent out 10,200 letters to newspapers throughout the U.S. and Canada to reach the largest audience possible. 

According to a census report, Mr Ernstein died in 1997 in San Bernadino. No records were available for Mrs Ernstein.
