Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers believes the club have pulled off a major transfer coup by bringing Mario Balotelli to the club for £16million - a fee he believes represents 'outstanding value'.

The 24-year-old Italian completed his transfer from AC Milan on Monday and trained alone at Liverpool's Melwood training ground.

He then headed to the Etihad Stadium, where he will meet up with his new team-mates before watching Liverpool's Premier League encounter with Manchester City from the directors' box.

Coup: Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers thinks the club have done great business in signing Balotelli

Rodgers told Liverpoolfc.com: 'This transfer represents outstanding value for the club and I think we have done a really smart piece of business here.

'There is no doubting Mario's ability; he is a world-class talent and someone who, for such a young age, has vast experience of playing at the very highest level.

'He has scored goals in the Barclays Premier League, in Italy, in the Champions League and for his country at international level.

'I believe we have the infrastructure, culture and environment to get the best out of him and help him achieve his true potential. We are a strong group here, committed to hard work and he will benefit from being around it.

'I am looking forward to working with him and helping him learn more, improve and progress as a player. I'm sure the supporters will make him feel very welcome.'
