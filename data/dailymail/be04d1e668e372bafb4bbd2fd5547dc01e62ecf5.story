Kell Brook has been reassured by doctors that he will be able to fight again after needing emergency surgery on a stab wound in his left thigh.

The IBF welterweight champion was stabbed in the leg while on holiday in Tenerife, but Brook's promoter Eddie Hearn has revealed the 28-year-old will be back in the ring.

Hearn told The Times: 'The wound looked so bad that I was worried his career would be over.

'But the doctors say the stab wound missed every major artery and he will make a complete recovery. He has been very, very lucky.

Brook's next fight was expected to take place on December 6 and he was reportedly being lined up for a fight against Amir Khan next year, but Hearn admitted he is unlikely to fight again in 2014. 

'He had been due to be in Las Vegas for the Floyd Mayweather fight before starting his training camp for December 6 in the US.

'But the plan now is just get him back to full health.'
