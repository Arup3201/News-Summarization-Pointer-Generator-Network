Claim: McKenna says his £4.99 Hypnotic Gastric Band app is a ‘surgery-free weight-loss solution’

A war of words has erupted between leading obesity surgeons and celebrity hypnotist Paul McKenna over whether hypnotherapy weight-loss apps actually work.

The smartphone market is flooded with downloads that promise to help users shed pounds.

Some, like McKenna’s, even claim to use hypnotherapy to mimic the results of drastic and costly weight-loss surgery.

However, top surgeons have warned that, in their opinion, giving customers the impression they will see the same results as gastric-band surgery is wrong.

The surgical procedure, which costs about £6,000, involves doctors implanting an inflatable band around the top of the stomach to create a small pouch, so patients feel fuller quicker.

McKenna says his £4.99 Hypnotic Gastric Band app is a ‘surgery-free weight-loss solution’ that ‘can help convince the unconscious mind that a gastric band has been fitted, so the body behaves as though a band is physically present’.

But Dr Carel le Roux, a lead physician at London’s Imperial College Healthcare’s obesity service, dismisses these claims as ‘a gimmick’. He says: ‘Hypnosis isn’t powerful enough to be effective in the long term.’

Consultant surgeon Paul Super, from the BMI Priory Hospital in Birmingham, agrees. He says: ‘It might be called a hypnotic gastric band, but is no more a physical operation than a hypnotic pacemaker or hypnotic hip replacement. If it worked, then why aren’t thousands of patients having it on the NHS?’

Currently, patients must have a Body Mass Index of 40 or above, or 35 or above with a serious health condition, to meet the criteria to have weight-loss surgery on the NHS.

Results are proven in numerous clinical trials: patients should expect to lose a third of their excess body weight within six months, and half within two years.

Why do my eyes water when I chop onions?

Professor Barry Smith, director of the Centre for the Study of the Senses at the University of London, says: ‘Spicy flavours like mustard and onions can irritate the trigeminal nerve in the brain, which is linked to the eyes, nose and mouth. 

When you chop onions, you release molecules into the air that get into the nose and cause a sting that irritates the trigeminal nerve. 

The nerve thinks your eyes are being attacked, so it sends a signal that makes them water to flush away the irritant.’ 

NHS treatments for obesity are based around a healthy diet and exercise, and in some cases medication such as Orlistat, which prevents about a third of fat from food being digested by the body.

Bariatric surgery is offered to people with potentially life-threatening obesity when other treatments have failed.

Some 6,500 weight-loss procedures were performed in 2013. These included fitting a gastric band, and gastric bypass – where the digestive system is rerouted to bypass most of the stomach and small intestine, meaning that patients can only eat small amounts of food. However, in response McKenna says that hypnotherapy is, as a matter of scientific fact, a proven means of weight loss. 

His spokesman explains that the gastric-band hypnotherapy app is ‘merely an innovative variation on a scientifically tried and tested means of weight loss’.

This includes a 1985 trial which showed 109 hypnosis patients lost significant amounts of weight, and continued to do so over a two-year period, when used alongside other ‘behavioural’ treatments, compared with patients who only had behavioural treatment.

NHS advice is that hypnotherapy can help with problems such as irritable bowel syndrome and the pain of childbirth, but there is not enough evidence to recommend it for weight loss.

Hypnotherapist Greg Forde, who has helped patients tackle their own weight issues, believes that linking a hypnotherapy product to a physical operation is ‘a complete waste of money’.

He says: ‘People are vulnerable – people are spending money on something they think will be a magic bullet. Everyone’s trigger is different so they need one-to-one support and you can’t get that through an app or CD.’

Help could soon be at hand for those who suffer cold sores. Studies have shown that an amino acid called lysine prevents flare-ups by inhibiting the herpes simplex virus that causes the sores, and blocking its attempts to replicate in the body. 

The richest natural sources of lysine are meat, dairy products, eggs and beans. A daily 1,000mg supplement should be taken as a preventative measure, but if the telltale signs are already there, taking 3,000mg a day should speed up the healing process. 

Gianluca Bonanomi, clinical lead for general and bariatric surgery at London’s Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, also warns that calling the app a ‘hypnotic gastric band’ could deter some dangerously obese patients from opting for surgery.

He says: ‘Gastric-band surgery is a big commitment. It is expensive if done privately and carries some risk, even though it is a very small one. Patients might see it as scary surgery, and then they come across a “hypnotic gastric band” that seems to be as effective and costs a lot less.

‘A physical band creates a barrier to food intake and reduces the appetite by having an effect on satiety on the brain. Mental-health approaches like hypnotherapy and psychotherapy can be beneficial, but it’s potentially misleading to associate them with a surgical procedure.’

Yet GP Michael Carmi, an expert backing McKenna, says the app is a safer and cheaper option that should be offered to patients contemplating gastric- band surgery.

He maintains that the term ‘hypnotic gastric band is merely a metaphor for significant weight loss’.

Mr Carmi adds: ‘If a hypnotic approach was offered to patients contemplating surgery, then this would reduce mortality and morbidity and be a considerable financial saving for the NHS.’
