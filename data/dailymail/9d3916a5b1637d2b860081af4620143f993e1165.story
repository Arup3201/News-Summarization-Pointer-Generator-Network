Suspicions: Arafat died in a French military hospital in 2004

French prosecutors have launched a murder inquiry into the 2004 death of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.

Arafat died in a French military hospital in 2004 from what doctors said at the time was a stroke.

But new evidence and pressure from his widow and a TV investigation have prompted authorities to examine the possibility he was actually poisoned.

There have long been rumours in the Arab world that Arafat was poisoned, and a Swiss lab's recent finding of elevated levels of a rare and highly lethal radioactive substance on Arafat's clothing has fed those claims.

However, the Institute of Radiation Physics said its findings were inconclusive and that only exhuming Arafat's remains could bring possible clarity. 

Palestinian officials have waffled on the matter - initially approving the exhumation and then saying the matter needed more study - only further fueling suspicions.

Still, since Arafat's death, several senior Palestinian officials have alleged that Israel poisoned the Palestinian leader, a charge Israel vehemently denied. 

Testing Arafat's bones for 
polonium-210 - the substance found on his clothes - could offer the last
chance to get to the bottom of Palestinian claims that their leader was
poisoned, though some experts say it may already be too late for 
conclusive answers.

Cause of death: Doctors at the Val de Grace hospital in Paris said he died from a stroke

Many have speculated that Arafat, whose West Bank grave is pictured here, was killed by an Israeli spy agency

Scientists caution that polonium decays quickly and that an autopsy needs to be done right away. 

The findings were first 
broadcast by Arab satellite TV station Al-Jazeera, which approached the 
lab on behalf of Arafat's widow, Suha.

She provided the lab with his clothing and other belongings.

When the results were released, Suha Arafat filed a complaint in French court asking for a murder investigation.

The
two judicial officials - who would only speak on condition of anonymity
because of office rules - said a judge will be appointed to run the 
investigation shortly.

The complaint is open and does not name a responsible party, as is a common practice in French courts.

Slow death: Russian security agent Alexander Litvinenko before his death in November 2006

Rumours suggesting Arafat was poisoned by Israeli intelligence agents have swirled around the middle east for years - fuelled by a recent investigation into a urine stain found on his underwear.

Tests found the urine had traces of Polonium-210, the highly radioactive substance that killed Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko (pictured) in 2006.

Other theories have speculated that Arafat actually died after contracting cancer, cirrhosis, or even HIV.

Those exposed to a lethal dose of Polonium, usually by ingesting it, die within 2-3 months.

In most cases there are no serious symptoms for a week after being exposed, but nausea and fatigue would set in soon after.

In
theory, just a microgram of Polonium - the same as a spec of dust - is 
enough to kill someone, due to its slowly-excreted alpha particles which
affect the body's organs.

After ingestion, Polonium affects the liver, kidneys, spleen, bone marrow, and gastrointestinal tract.

Serious
illness would not be expected for a month, due to the amount of time it
takes to accumulate dangerous internal exposures.

As
the severity of the exposure develops in the body, victims usually lose
hair, and the lining of the gastrointestinal system is destroyed. This later leads to severe diarrhea, intestinal bleeding, loss of fluids, and disturbance of electrolyte balance.

Though
it takes 5-6 weeks to seriously affect most, the symptoms of Polonium 
poisoning contrast to the case of Litvinenko who fell ill the 
day after he was exposed.

The Russian died 23 days after being exposed, an indication that he was poisoned with many times the required lethal dosage.
