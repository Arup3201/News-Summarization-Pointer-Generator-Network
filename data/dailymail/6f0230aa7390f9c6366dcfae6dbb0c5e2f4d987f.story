His public appearances have seen him star in many roles; ruthless hunter, martial arts expert, fearless fisherman braving freezing waters.

But Putin's latest attempts to paint himself as an artist while visiting a school has left his young fans less than convinced.

The Russian President showed off his skills with a classroom sketch on a white board at a middle school in the Siberian Kurgan.

Pupils were left giggling when the president revealed that he had drawn a cat's behind for the class.

Pupils were left giggling when President Putin revealed that he had drawn a cat's behind for the class

The Russian President showed off his skills with a classroom sketch on a white board at a middle school in the Siberian Kurgan

When a pupil asked what the drawing was, Putin replied: 'It's a cat - from the rear'

The appearance sits at odds with the President's past attempts to show himself to be a bold and fearless leader, and showed a rarely seen fun-loving side to him

'This is for you to remember'  he said, before carrying on with his sketch, the Huffington Post reports.

When a pupil asked what the drawing was, Putin replied: 'It’s a cat - from the rear', causing the class to collpase into giggles.

The appearance sits at odds with the President's past attempts to show himself to be a bold and fearless leader, and showed a rarely seen fun-loving side to him. 

It comes days after the Russian President displayed a less flippant attitude to art, when police seized a painting of him wearing women's underwear from a gallery, saying the satirical display had broken the law.

The painting entitled 'Travesty' by Konstantin Altunin, shows President Putin wearing a tight-fitting slip and brushing the hair of Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, who is wearing knickers and a bra.

Police swooped on the Muzei Vlasti (Museum of Authorities) in St. Petersburg on the night of August 26 confiscating several art installations, including 'Travesty' which are to be checked for extremist propaganda.

A picture of the leader of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill I, with his torso covered in tattoos, and two others poking fun at lawmakers who have backed legislation banning so-called gay propaganda, were also confiscated, gallery staff said.

St Petersburg was one of the first Russian cities to introduce a law banning the spread of 'gay propaganda' and making it a crime 'to spread information about non-traditional sexual behavior' to those under 18.
