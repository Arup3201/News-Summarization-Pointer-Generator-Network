A seriously ill toddler died after a 70-minute wait in a GP’s surgery despite desperate pleas for her to be seen immediately by a doctor, her grief-stricken parents said yesterday.

Lucie Linforth was taken to her local practice after developing a severe cough and fever but was behind a queue of 20 patients.

Her father begged the receptionist five times to call a doctor as the 23-month-old began struggling to breathe and her lips turned blue, but his pleas fell on deaf ears.

By the time she was finally taken in 
to see a nurse in a ‘minor illness’ room, Lucie had stopped breathing. A
GP rushed to help and spent 45 minutes frantically trying to revive her
before she was taken to Bedford Hospital where she was pronounced dead.
A post-mortem examination failed to establish the cause of Lucie’s 
death on October 5. Further tests are being done.

Her mother, Angie Collins, 40, said: 
‘Every day I don’t know how I get out of bed. Nothing will ever hurt me 
more than this. She was so full of life and I feel really angry that 
there was an hour and ten minutes where nothing was done. I feel they 
took away her lifeline.

‘She was a healthy, vibrant, lively character, full of fight and her life was just chucked away that morning.

‘If people had just opened their eyes they would have seen just how poorly she was.’

Tributes: Flowers and teddy bears laid outside Marston Surgery

Her partner, Eric Linforth, 33, added:
‘After about 20 minutes waiting at the surgery she got worse, her lips 
were blue, she was really hot and she was having trouble breathing. I 
went up about four or five times asking to be seen.

‘Finally, I went up and said they had 
to call an ambulance because she had got so bad. They took her into the 
nurse’s room but by that point her heart had stopped beating.’

The couple have launched a campaign 
called ‘Lucie’s Legacy’ to change the system in waiting rooms so that 
vulnerable children, whose condition can deteriorate rapidly, are always
given priority.

Campaign: Lucie's mother Angie said she wouldn't stop until she got justice for her daughter

At present there are no formal rules on how GPs should prioritise patients.

Miss Collins, of Marston Moretaine, 
near Bedford, added: ‘I want to get Lucie’s story out there and try and 
stop it happening again.’ Lucie fell ill on the night of October 4. Her 
father took her to Marston Surgery the following morning while her 
mother waited at home with the toddler’s twin, Jake, and sister Holly, 
three.

Mr Linforth, an electrician, arrived 
at 8.45am. When it opened 15 minutes later the receptionist told him 
there were already 20 people on the waiting list.

He claimed the receptionist refused to
even look at his daughter and insisted he wait his turn as he 
repeatedly went up to ask for urgent help.

When he became agitated he said the woman pointed to a sign warning any patients who became abusive would not be seen at all.

Lucie was taken in to see a nurse at 
10.10am and a doctor was called when it became clear her heart had 
stopped. An emergency team also tried to resuscitate her at hospital.

Miss Collins added: ‘Jake doesn’t 
really know what’s going on but he’s been acting differently. They had 
matching twin beds. Since Lucie died he just goes to his sister’s bed 
and cries himself to sleep.’

Bedfordshire Police have begun an 
investigation, although the death is not being treated as suspicious. An
inquest has been opened and adjourned.

Dr Fiona Sim, medical director of NHS 
Bedfordshire and Luton, said: ‘This is a tragic death and our thoughts are with the family.

‘There is an ongoing coroner’s inquiry
and we are providing every assistance as well as working with the 
practice to carry out an internal investigation.’

Marston Surgery declined to comment.
