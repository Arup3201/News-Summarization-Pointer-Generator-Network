A gecko so small it can fit on the end of a pencil has been drawing a lot of attention.

The tiny reptile is called the Fantastic, or the Satanic leaf tailed, gecko due to its point raised 'brow ridges'.

In the wild they are masters of camouflage and mimic dead leaves and twigs.

The Fantastic, or the Satanic leaf tailed, gecko is so small it can sit on the head of a pencil

Their legs look like little branches and their tails look just like dead leaves – all the way down to having veins and raggedy edges.

It was born at Houston Zoo in Texas, USA, last month and will soon be on display once it grows a bit bigger.

A zoo spokesman said: ‘Leaf-tailed geckos are found only on Madagascar where populations are decreasing mainly due to habitat loss caused by logging, agriculture and cattle grazing.

The Gecko is so small that sometimes staff at the zoo have difficulty finding it

The Fantastic, or Satanic leaf tailed, gecko is native to Madagascar and was first described in 1888 by George Albert Boulenger (1858-1937), a British zoologist, who said it was ‘mythical’ because of its unique look. Its scientific name is Uroplatus phantasticus – meaning imaginary flat tail.

Geckos have no eyelids and so they use their long, mobile tongues to wipe away any dust or debris that gets into the eye.

It is a nocturnal animal feeding on insects such as crickets and moths.. When faced with a predator, it flattens its body to reduce its shadow, shows off its red mouth or sheds its tail.

‘They are active at night and eat mostly insects.

‘The females lay two eggs at a time – as an adult these animals will be between four and six inches in length. Right now he's about the same size as a pencil eraser.

‘We're often hard pressed to find them in their enclosure – sometimes you're looking right at them and don't even know it.’

The Satanic gecko will voluntarily lose its tail if threatened by a predator
