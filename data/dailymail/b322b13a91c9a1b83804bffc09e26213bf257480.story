Mary Portas was last night accused of misleading Parliament about a £500,000 television fee she received following her government-backed review of Britain’s high streets.

The self-styled retail guru told MPs last week she was not paid to make TV shows on the back of her report. 

But last night, in a humiliating clarification, she admitted she had received the huge sum from Channel 4.

Mary Portas was last night accused of misleading Parliament about a £500,000 television fee she received following her government-backed review of Britain¿s high streets

Earlier this year Miss Portas made a series called Mary: Queen of the High Street for Channel 4, where she visited three of the towns trying to implement her plans. 

In written evidence to the influential Communities and Local Government Committee, published yesterday, Miss Portas insisted she had ‘misinterpreted’ the question.

Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who sits on the committee, said: ‘It’s very disappointing that Mary Portas wasn’t straight with Parliament when asked about this.

'She’s always claimed she only did her high street review out of the goodness of her heart. Yet we now know she was paid handsomely by Channel 4 to make a television programme based on it.’

Miss Portas was asked several times during last week¿s hearing whether she had received £500,000 from Channel 4

Miss Portas was asked several times during last week’s hearing whether she had received £500,000 from Channel 4.

An article in the Daily Mail on June 23 reported she was paid the sum for her two-year contract with the broadcaster.

She replied: ‘If I was getting £500,000 for Channel 4, let me tell you, I would be a happy woman. I am not. 

‘Those numbers that they were bashing about – I am surprised you listen to the Daily Mail, Mr Danczuk, but never mind. I do not get that money, let me tell you.’

But after the hearing Miss Portas wrote to committee chairman Clive Betts, listing ‘things I believe require further clarification or correction’.

She wrote: ‘The committee asked me if I was paid £500,000 by Channel 4. I misinterpreted this to mean for the Mary: Queen of the High Street series.

'My contract with Channel 4 covers two years with a requirement to make 20 episodes in total and amounts to £500,000.’

Mary: Queen of the High Street ran for only three episodes. 

Mr Danczuk, who had asked Miss Portas directly about the money, added: ‘There are not many people I know who could forget about a half-a-million-pound payment.’

'Disappointing': Mary: Queen of the High Street ran for only three episodes

Following the Portas Review, published almost two years ago, 12 towns were selected to receive £1.2million of taxpayers’ cash for renewal schemes.

The 12 towns have seen 700 shops close and only 600 open during 2012, with Margate and Bedminster recording an increase in empty shops. 

The review received a mixed reception, with one pundit comparing it to a report written by a GCSE student. Miss Portas could not be reached for comment.
