Two Italian music producers conspired to claim authorship of hundreds of songs and received hundreds of thousands of euros from Italian radio and television networks. 

Athos Poma, and his accomplice Giuseppe Fedi, claimed rights to more than 200 tracks over a period of three years. 

Athos Poma, and his accomplice Giuseppe Fedi, claimed rights to more than 200 tracks over a period of three years

The pair took advantage of an error at the Italian Society of Authors and Publishers, the Italian body responsible for copyright protection, that meant composers of many popular songs were not properly registered in the system. 

While the problem was fixed, the organisation created a holding fund for royalties until they could be returned to the rightful recipient.

Poma, under the guidance of Fedi, an employee of the society, told the authority that he was the composer of many of the unregistered tracks.

Between the start of 2006 and the end of 2008, Poma claimed rights to 220 songs.

The pair made a total of 250,000 euros from the scam.

Between the start of 2006 and the end of 2008, Poma claimed rights to 220 songs.

Poma has been sentenced to a year and six months in jail for fraud, while Fedi, who also appeared in court on fraud charges, was given a sentence of a year and eight months on Saturday.

Poma was acquitted on charges of plagiarism.

Giuseppe Vaciago and Giovanni d'Ammassa defending Poma, said their client would appeal.

‘Athos Poma is one of the most important music producers in Italy and over the last 25 years, he has always carried out his work in a professional manner,’ they said.

 An earlier version of this article stated that Athos Poma had claimed the work of other composers, namely Tom Jones's Sex Bomb, Paul McCartney's My Love, Liar by Queen, All I need by Radiohead and People are Strange by The Doors. We are happy to clarify that this is not the case.
