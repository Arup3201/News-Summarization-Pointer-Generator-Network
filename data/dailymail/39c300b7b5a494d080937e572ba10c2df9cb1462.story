Children's academic ability could be tested as soon as they start primary school aged four or five under plans unveiled by Nick Clegg.

Pupils are currently tested at seven to set a ‘baseline’ for measuring their progress in school.

But details of plans to do this during reception year emerged in a consultation document launched by the Deputy Prime Minister, which also includes plans to rank primary school pupils against their peers across the country.

Pupils could also be ranked against their peers across the country, being put in achievement 'bands'

This would see primaries having to ensure 85 per cent of pupils are ready for senior school or risk triggering an Ofsted inspection.

Pupils could also be ranked against their peers across the country, being put in 10 per cent achievement ‘bands’, showing, for example, if they are in the top 10 per cent.

The consultation document contains a reference to a ‘new benchmark’ to assess ‘progress that has been made by 11-year-olds’.

It says the ‘baseline’ test ‘could be at age seven, as now, where teachers assess pupils; or a simple check of a child’s ability in the early weeks of a child’s career at school’.

Schools that fail to increase this to 85 per cent by 2016 under the measures outlined by Mr Clegg could be judged to be under-performing

Nick Clegg said today: 'All we’re saying is it can’t surely be right that under the current standards a school is deemed to be doing okay if four out of ten of the children who leave primary school are judged not to be ready to have a good start at secondary school.

'This is not to try and either humiliate or celebrate, it’s to give teachers and parents an idea of how that child measures up to other children in the school system. That’s all it is.

'I saw some comments from teaching unions this morning that somehow this was a lurch back to a name-and-shame approach, it’s not at all.

'So it’s higher standards, more money, and the aspiration, the hope is simply to make sure everybody gets the best possible start in life.'

A source close to Mr Clegg added last night: ‘We are going to have new tests at 11 and we need to have a new baseline.

‘We are open-minded about whether you do it at seven or even earlier. It would be a teacher-led assessment.’

Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw suggested last month that children should be tested in basic language and literacy even before they start formal education. He warned testing pupils at the end of their reception year was already too late, adding: ‘Children may have lost a vital year of learning by then.’

Currently just 60 per cent of 11-year-olds in a school are required to reach Level 4 in maths and English Sats – the standard expected of their age group.

Schools that fail to increase this to 85 per cent by 2016 under the measures outlined by Mr Clegg yesterday could be judged to be under-performing.

They could be taken over and turned into academies.

The current marking system will also be axed, although its replacement has not been confirmed.

The point at which children are judged to be on track to start secondary school will also be raised. At present, achieving Level 4C – the bottom third of the Level 4 pass range – is considered acceptable. Yet just 47 per cent of these children go on to get five good GCSEs, including maths and English.

Mr Clegg confirmed the pupil premium – extra funding for disadvantaged pupils – is to increase from £900 to £1,300 in primary schools from next year to help improve standards. Around one in seven pupils qualify for the financial support.

Critics have previously voiced concerns about pupils spending too much time preparing for tests instead of  learning at school. After taking national tests at seven, they sit more Sats in maths, English and science when they are 11. Some take their first GCSEs the following year and complete them when they are 16, making four sets of exams in ten years.

AS-levels and A-levels bring the total to six in 12 years. Mr Clegg’s planned test would make it seven in 12 years.

Brian Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ‘The problems with the tests at the end of primary school are well documented.

‘Most secondary schools re-test pupils at the start of Year 7 because they don’t trust the accuracy of data they have to work with.

‘A fairer, more accurate way of measuring pupils’ ability at the end of primary school is certainly needed.

‘I am not convinced ranking 11-year-olds will help to raise standards. I worry what will happen to those children who have tried hard yet are told they are in one of the bottom bands.

‘Children at that age mature differently and their confidence can be easily damaged. It could make secondary teachers’ job in building self-esteem and confidence even more difficult.’

Chris Keates, general secretary of the teachers’ union NASUWT, said: ‘School level assessments are fine in principle but in the context of current high-stakes accountability, with no framework for support or provision of resources, the outcome is likely be a bureaucratic nightmare for teachers.’
