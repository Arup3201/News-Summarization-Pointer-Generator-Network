When Nasrin Hamalaw's 30-year-old daughter Rangin was killed fighting Islamic State jihadis near Kirkuk in Iraq, she was left heartbroken.

Now Ms Hamalaw, 55, a veteran of battles against a vengeful Saddam Hussein during the 1970s, plans to take revenge - by returning to the front line to massacre the terrorists herself.

'They are dirt,' she spits furiously. 'They are the dirtiest people in the world, especially for those of us who are women.

Killed: Ms Yousuf (centre), a mother-of-one, was killed during heavy fighting outside the town of Khurmatu

'If they take you they will kill you or rape you or sell you or do anything they want. Breaking you is their business. They are the dirtiest people.'

Like her husband Yousuf Majid, also 55, Ms Hamalaw is a colonel in the Kurdish armed forces or peshmerga as they are more commonly known.

Based close to the town of Khurmatu in northern Iraq's Salahaddin Province, both are part of the battle against IS jihadis, although in different battalions and on different parts of the front line.

Their daughter Rangin, a captain in the 2nd Battalion Peshmerga Female and the mother of a seven-year-old son, was, they say, was an accomplished fighter.

'I'm proud of every single thing she ever did and I have so many good memories of her,' adds her sobbing mother. 

'She never did anything that I couldn't be proud of. To me, she's not a martyr. She's alive and she's going to stay with me for ever.'

Devastated: Mr Majid shows off a badge emblazoned with a photo of the daughter of whom he was 'so proud'

Vengeance: Ms Hamelaw, a veteran fighter, has vowed to return to the frontline to get her revenge on IS

Talented: According to her parents, Ms Yousef was enormously talented and wanted to become a politician

Proud: Mr Majid says he taught his daughter to fight for her country's freedom from an early age

Rangin, the first woman from the Iraqi-Kurdish peshmerga to be killed, died after a mortar exploded near her position during heavy fighting, leaving her body riddled with shrapnel.

Her mother was fighting alongside her at the time. 'I started teaching her to shoot when she was 11,' she smiles through her tears.

'She learned with me, her mother. And when she was killed, she was with me, her mother, as well. We were on the front line and they were shooting at us.'

Mr Majid, also a veteran fighter, was with his battalion further down the front line when news of his daughter's death arrived.

'The day my daughter was injured, my wife was there with her on the front line,' he remembers. 'I was further down in a place called Zirka, which is also on the front line. I got a message to say that my daughter had been injured.'

Critically wounded, Rangin died 10 days later in hospital. Now her parents are returning to the front line - and have vowed to kill as many IS jihadis as they can before they are killed themselves.

'From the day of the first IS attack, we knew about the possibility that we might have to die for our country,' explains Mr Majid.

'That is why we chose to be peshmerga. The word peshmerga means "face of death". Being a peshmerga means you have to face up to death. That is why we chose to be peshmerga. 

'We want to get freedom for our own country. If we hadn't chosen that, my daughter wouldn't have been killed. But it is what is right.'

Women have long fought as frontline troops with the peshmerga which was, until recently, one of the few military organisations to allow it.

In Britain, men were, until earlier this year, the only ones allowed frontline combat roles although women can and do play an important part in all three services.

Despite the loss of his daughter, Mr Majid says the peshmerga's stance on female fighters is the correct one.

'I believe in equality from day one,' he explains. 'I don't see any difference between men and women on the frontline. I respected my daughter's ability. 

Hard work: Ms Yousef, far right, had recently been promoted to captain thanks to her exceptional fighting skills

Sad: Ms Yousef's commander, Colonel Nahida Ahmad Rashid, says she is heartbroken at the loss of her friend

'When we trained together, they asked us to  hit targets [in a firing range]. I couldn't do it but my daughter hit it every time. 

'Always, there has been equality between us. Any woman can be as good with weapons as a man. My daughter could have been any Kurdish person's daughter.'

The peshmerga, who are being supported from the air by British planes, have enjoyed some success in recent weeks and are pushing the jihadists back towards Mosul.

A small, all-male, detachment have also travelled to Turkey to join the fight against IS in Kobani, the Syrian border town that has been the scene of heavy fighting in recent days.

Nevertheless, the fighting in northern Iraq remains intense, with Ms Hamalaw saying that the former Ba'ath party men who have flocked to join IS in the north are making the situation ever more dangerous.

'The IS people are all ex Ba'thist guys,' she sniffs scornfully. 'The governor of Mosul is Saddam Hussein's nephew. Most of them are Ba'athists.'

Tough: The peshmerga has long put its female fighters in frontline combat roles, including against IS

Dangerous job: After months of heavy fighting, the peshmerga have begun to push IS back towards Mosul

Despite the couple's defiance, they admit that they have been left heartbroken by the death of their daughter and say the only thing left for them to do is avenge her death. 

'I taught her from childhood to take care of Kurdistan and work for independence,' adds her father.

'Her whole family have been revolutionaries and my grandfather, my brother, my uncle and my cousins were all killed fighting for our country. 

'I didn't teach her any other thing - only that. She died for freedom and independence.'

But, he adds, the current battle is not about politics. Instead, it's about ending the scourge of IS. 'We have no ideology,' he says. 'We just want to fight the terrorists. We fight to finish the terror.'

And if that means risking death, then, says Ms Hamalaw, so be it. 'From the day we become peshmerga, we put our souls in our hands,' she explains.

'Any day, our souls can, like a bird, fly away. We are the face of death -  we are peshmerga. We go to fight, we go to fight IS.

'Of course you might get killed. Of course you will kill someone else. That is how it is.'

Of their daughter, whose soul has already flown, they have only memories. 'She wanted to be a politician,' smiles her father sadly.

'She was a candidate for mayor as well but her life has been snuffed out. She's gone.'
