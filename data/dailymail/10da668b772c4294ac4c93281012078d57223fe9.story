It is a measure of what Diego Simeone is achieving at Atletico Madrid that when they beat Real Madrid on Wednesday night it was their third consecutive derby win and it is the first time they have managed that in 65 years.

This is the club that went 14 years without beating their richer capital rivals. Fernando Torres had never beaten Real before but then he had never tried with Simeone on the touchline barking orders, conducting the crowd, celebrating with son Guiliano who was ball-boy for the night.

Atletico’s manic manager can do no wrong. He watches Thibaut Courtois, Diego Costa and Felipe Luis leave for Chelsea in the summer – no problem, he just builds another indestructible side. He rests key players because he knows he has Barcelona away on Sunday – no problem, the Atletico B defender Lucas, previously out of favour Mario Suarez, and second choice keeper Oblak all do fine.

He brings back 30-year-old Torres – no problem he runs around for an hour like a 21-year. Simeone could probably bring back Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Christian Vieri and that would work out too.

How does he do it? There is an energy and an intensity about the man that transmits to his team but it would be doing him a disservice to reduce the magic to fist waving and shouting.

Simeone’s teams are very difficult to beat. The well drilled defence is protected by a wall of four tireless midfielders and often one of the front two. They press in packs when they have to take the game to the opposition and they defend deeply and impenetrably when they have the lead.

The Argentine is also the master of setting the agenda. Last season he repeated his ‘one game at a time’ mantra to such an extent that the huge pressure on the team – mounting as they came ever closer to what at the start of the season looked like an impossible league title – shifted to the coach and his obsession with this partido-a-partido phrase.

He regularly used Jose Mourinho-style ‘little-horse’ kidology in that monumental battle with Barcelona and Real Madrid and it was both more believable and more effective.

And like Mourinho he has a strong team around him with Mono Burgos, his former Atletico team-mate is his loyal number two, and Oscar Ortega is the fitness coach who drives that intensity in training that Simeone demands during games.

There is a togetherness created by the coach that carries Atletico clear of the more divided dressing rooms at the bigger wealthier clubs.

His preference for players to all eat around a big table rather than in cliques at various tables, and his tactic of speaking to them individually before they turn in for the night before games – almost as if he wants them to dream those final match day instructions play a part in his very particular method.

He says he is still learning and improving. He perhaps let his heart rule his head in last year’s Champions League final by playing Costa from the start only to have to substitute him injured. And he then lost his head, taking to the pitch in the second half after the ball was kicked in his direction. But even the weaknesses add to the legend because they are born of his passion for winning.

Would he win elsewhere should he move on? The communion he has with the supporters as a former player and captain would be hard to replicate and part of his success in Spain comes from Atletico being a physical force that teams in the Premier League might be more able to cope with than some sides in La Liga. But it would be fascinating finding out.

His English is limited but he is driven enough to change that if the right opportunity came along. For the time being it’s difficult to see how anyone would be able to tempt him away from the team he is building on the banks of the Manzanares. Antoine Griezmann, Koke, Saul Ñiguez and Jose Giminez are all very young players – the basis is there for the team to keep moving forward at least until 2017 when Simeone’s contract runs out.

The Argentine national job would be the obvious next step. But the cue of Premier League owners making sure things do not follow a logical path gets that little bit longer ever time his side turns over a Spanish superpower in front of a global audience. Real Madrid last night… Barcelona up next on Sunday.
