A primary school was forced into lockdown after a mystery gunman was spotted outside while children were on a lunch break, but the scare turned out to be police on an anti-terror exercise.

The headteacher of St Luke's C of E Primary School in Cambridge has criticised police for carrying out the military training on Tuesday without letting them know in advance.

Pupils informed teachers they had seen a man with a gun running behind some houses and were swiftly moved off the playing fields as staff searched the area.

Head teacher Steve Down said: 'I am disappointed the school was not informed that this exercise was happening.

'I have to ask if conducting such an exercise outside a school is the best place, but I am pleased at how well the school responded to keep the children safe.

'I will be speaking to the police further about the incident and how they are planning on closing the case.'

Mr Down said no police, military vehicles or personnel were spotted near the school, which caters for 199 pupils, but two brothers said their friends who spotted the gunman were 'really scared'.

Eight-year-old, Alec Brown,  said: 'My friend saw the man with the gun and now he is really scared.

'Why did they have guns near a school? They should have told the teachers.'

His brother Eddie, six, said: 'The police are really stupid. How can they be secret when even a kid can see them with a gun. I thought they were supposed to be clever.'

A 43-year-old mother, who asked not to be named, said her eight-year-old son was one of three boys who spotted the gunman on the other side of the railings on the school field.

She said: 'He came home from school and I was asking him how his day was and he just started saying how he had seen this guy with a gun.

'They love building dens in that part of the field and climbing in the trees and it is right by the railings.

'They were just playing by there he said he saw this guy walking along carrying a gun, so they started to follow him.

'They saw him put it in his pocket and then he said he "went to tell a grown up".

'A first I thought "oh was it really a gun", or could it have been a lighter or something like that. But when he told me how the school acted I thought it must have been serious.

'It's very scary, only recently a gunshot was fired through a couple's house near to the school so I really do think this is the least sensitive place they could have held this exercise.

Head teacher Steve Down said he is 'disappointed' with police for not informing them beforehand

'Why did they do it there and why did they do at lunchtime?

'I have a lot of respect for the police and I know they have a hard job to do especially after what happened in Paris, but I just cannot understand why they did it.

'The boys were quite scared by it. I mean they're boys and they found it exciting but it's very scary at the same time. I think the school dealt with it really well though.'

Parent and former teacher Fletcher Brock, 38, said: 'I can't believe the school weren't told about it.

'The man was right by the gate where a lot of the girls build dens so they would have been really close to him.

'Why was it held it the lunch hour and why just outside a school? I can't understand it.'

Another parent, who asked not to be named, said: 'My son said the man had a handgun and was at the school fence and he is not prone to making things up. 

'I think the school did the right thing. The teachers were brilliant as usual.'

A similar training exercise by Cambridgeshire police in nearby St Ives the same day was captured in a video posted on Facebook by a passer-by.

A police spokesman said: 'Cambridgeshire Constabulary is currently taking part in a joint training exercise with the military and other stakeholders.

'The exercise is over two days, Tuesday and Wednesday. This exercise forms an integral part of our training programme to test our contingency plans.

'The event is pre-planned and not arranged in response to any increased threat to the region.

'Members of the public may see an increased police presence in the exercise area, while the exercise is live.

'They can be assured that during the event, they will not experience any reduction in the quality of service provided.'

But police later claimed the pupils who saw the gunman had ‘overactive imaginations’. 

Meanwhile a primary school in Wiltshire has defended its decision stage an emergency 'lock-down drill', just days after the Paris massacre.  

Children at Westbury Leigh Primary School in the town were told to hide under their desks and told to keep quiet to practice what they should do in an emergency situation.

But while some parents welcomed the drill, others criticised the school for not warning them and claim their children were frightened and left suffering from nightmares.

Kimberley Turner, whose seven-year-old son goes to the school in Westbury, Wiltshire, said: 'My son learned what a terrorist was from school last week, he's seven.

'Since then I have found one of his drawings of a terrorist holding an axe with an injured person covered in blood.

'I'm terrified he's going to Google it and be met with some of the recent beheading videos.'

Writing on Facebook, another parent Julia Vowles added: 'It would be nice to have it communicated to the parents.

'That way we are prepared for any questions that may arise from our children and for any other issues that may arise.'

The drill on Friday saw 400 pupils aged four to 11 prepare for anything from a dangerous stranger on the premises, to a terrorist attack.

While staff did not specifically mention 'terrorists', parents criticised the timing of the event, and said children would have seen the Paris tragedy on TV.

Headteacher Debbie Grimsey said the school has been holding drills for its 'lockdown/sheltering procedure' for 'a number of years' alongside fire evacuations.

She said: 'Emergency evacuation and sheltering is practised regularly. Using both drills enable us to prepare children for an unplanned situation.

'It makes sure they are aware of what is expected of them and also minimise any panic, which can occur in an emergency situation, such as an external gas leak.

'As a result of each drill we assess and review how well our policies and procedures have worked and seek to improve our practice further. Our main priority is the safety of all pupils, staff and visitors on site.'
