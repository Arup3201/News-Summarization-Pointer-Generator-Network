The performances of Eden Hazard have been so good this season that many Chelsea fans may have forgotten they have another of his family on the books at the club. 

But Thorgan, 21, is doing himself no harm on his loan spell away from Stamford Bridge at Borussia Monchengladbach. 

The German outfit are flying high in the Bundesliga, second only behind Bayern Munich, and the youngster scored a superb goal to open the scoring away at Frankfurt in the German Cup on Wednesday night.

Finishing off a fine flowing move, Hazard, like his elder brother often does, found space on the left-hand side to curl home past the goalkeeper.

The match finished 2-1 to the visitors at the Commerzbank-Arena, with Ibrahima Toure doubling their advantage before Vaclav Kadelc pulled one back late on for Frankfurt.

Hazard is one of several Chelsea loanees plying their trade in the Bundesliga, with Lucas Piazon and Tomas Kalas also impressing at Frankfurt and Cologne.
