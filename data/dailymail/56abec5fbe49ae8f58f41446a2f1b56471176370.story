Brighton have signed Leon Best on loan from Blackburn Rovers.

Seagulls boss Chris Hughton has swooped to bring the former Newcastle frontman to the Amex Stadium for the remainder of the season.

Best worked with Hughton during their time together at St James' Park and he will be hoping the 28-year-old can boost his firepower for the second half of the campaign.

He said: 'I know Leon very well, having signed him during my time at Newcastle. He is a strong, physical presence, he knows the Championship and knows the position we are in.'

Meanwhile, Wigan striker Marc-Antoine Fortune is a target for Championship rivals Ipswich and Charlton.

The 33-year-old has managed just two goals in 19 appearances for the struggling Latics so far this term. 

Elsewhere, Fulham defender Fernando Amorebieta is wanted by La Liga outfit Real Betis.

The versatile Venezuelan, who can play centre-half or left-back, is currently sidelined with a knee injury but the Spanish side are keen to push through a deal.
