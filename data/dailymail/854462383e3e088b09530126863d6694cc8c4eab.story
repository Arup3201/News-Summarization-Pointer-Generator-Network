Former Juventus star Pavel Nedved was left in tears of laughter after the unveiling of his wax statue at a museum in Prague.

The 2003 European footballer of the year was presented alongside the waxwork at the Grevin wax museum and couldn’t contain his amusement.

Nedved, who retired from football in 2009, joins other Czech greats such as Chelsea star Petr Cech and eight-time tennis Grand Slam champion Ivan Lendl as a waxwork in the museum.

The 42-year-old won seven trophies with Lazio, including the Serie A in 2000, before he left to join Juventus.

In Turin Nedved truly shined, becoming one of the world’s top players and collecting numerous trophies. He won two Serie A titles, the last in 2003 when he was awarded the Ballon d’Or and helped Juventus reach the Champions League final.

The Czech was also crucial for his national side for 15 years after his debut in 1994. He picked up 91 caps for the Czech Republic, guiding them to the final of Euro 96.
