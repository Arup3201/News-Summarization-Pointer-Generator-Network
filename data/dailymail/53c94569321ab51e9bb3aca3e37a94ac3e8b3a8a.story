Students at a Mormon church-owned university have launched a protest against a ban on something its namesake once sported: a beard.  

About 50 young men at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, stormed the campus on bikes, rollerblades and skateboards sporting real or fake beards calling on the school to end the 'outdated' rule.

They were all required to signed a 1940s 'honor code' when they joined the school accepting that 'men are expected to be clean-shaven'.

But now, they are revolting - and holding up early Mormon leaders as their inspiration.

The organizer of the Bike For Beards demonstration on Friday night, Shane Pittson, said: 'I love BYU. I love being a student here but the rule on beards I find particularly outdated.'

The 23-year-old international studies major and other students have launched a petition drive to get the school to lift the ban.

University spokeswoman Carri Jenkins said students agree to its grooming standards before their first day of class and the beard ban was set in place by students.

'It's nothing against beards. It's just how we choose to represent ourselves at the university,' she told The Salt Lake Tribune.

Brigham Young and many other early leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints grew beards as they aged. 

A statue of Young in downtown Salt Lake City depicts him with a beard, but another at BYU shows him clean-shaven.

Agreement: Students at the Mormon church-run school agreed to be clean shaven when they enrolled 

The BYU Honor Code, created in the 1940s, states that 'men are expected to be clean-shaven' and beards are not acceptable. But students can be exempted from the prohibition if they have a medical condition such as scarring.

Among other things, the university's mandatory student contract also forbids premarital sex, alcohol consumption and tattoos.

In 1971, then-university President Dallin Oaks defended the beard ban as 'contemporary and pragmatic,' but he said he would be surprised if it was not eventually changed.

At the time, Oaks said beards and long hair on men were elements of 'slovenly appearance' linked to 'protest, revolution and rebellion against authority. They are also symbols of hippie and drug culture.'

Pittson enjoyed growing his own beard this summer, but he shaved before the protest.

'I figured it would make more of an impact to say, "I respect the university and here I am abiding by the rules but asking for change," ' he told The Tribune.
