Nasa has teamed up with car manufacturer Nissan to develop new self-driving cars that could be used to race across the surface of Mars.

The technology created during the five-year partnership will also be adapted to create better driverless vehicles that can be used on roads on Earth.

Robotics experts from the space agency will work with engineers from Nissan to adapt the company's electric Leaf cars.

Future rovers on Mars could look more like Nissan's Leaf electric cars as the automobile manufacturer is to develop technology jointly with Nasa to create self-driving vehicles that could be used on Earth and in space

Nissan has pledged to have autonomous cars on the market by 2020, but the technology currently faces significant challenges to cope with the dangers of public roads.

However, Nasa believes sensors and systems being developed to help driverless cars deal with pedestrians, cyclists, overtaking vehicles and parked cars, could also help to develop new robotic rovers for use in exploring other planets.

Nasa is hoping to send the next generation of rover to continue exploring the Red Planet in 2020. 

With upgraded hardware and instruments, it will examine the Martian rocks and assess the potential of the environment for humans to live in one day and search for signs of Martian life.

It will identify and collect rock and soil samples, which it will eventually be able to send back to Earth intact with the help of another future spacecraft that will land on the surface and pick them up.

Dr Charles Elachi, director of Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, has previously said that collecting a rock sample and bringing it back to Earth is Nasa's top priority.

Scientists are particularly interested in the samples so they can understand the hazards posed by Martian dust and demonstrate how oxygen can be created - details important to consider for human missions to Mars and the future colonisation of the planet.

The rover marks the next major step in fulfilling President Obama's challenge of sending humans to Mars in the 2030s. 

In an attempt to speed up the next rover, the European Space Agency  

Currently rovers like Nasa's Curiosity move at an achingly slow pace over the surface of Mars - it has a top speed of 0.08mph (0.13km/h).

This is slow progress is necessary to allow the rover's computers time to detect and manouvour around obstacles like rocks and deep sandpits that might bog it down.

Such limitations have meant that missions to the Red Planet have explored just a tiny fraction of its surface. The Mars Rover Opportunity has traveled just 25 miles in more than 10 years on the planet.

By adapting technology to be used on Earth's roads, it could allow rovers to travel at far greater speeds and explore much more of the surface.

This could prove crucial in scouting out potential sites for future manned missions to the Martian surface.

Dr Pete Worden, director of Nasa Ames Research Centre in California, told Wired: 'The more we look at it, the more there are a lot of similarities there.

'We have a rover on Mars - it is not very autonomous. As we go deeper into space, into more and more dangerous locations, we need to add that autonomy.'

It is not the first project that Nasa and Nissan have collaborated on. In 2005 the two organisations teamed up to develop more comfortable and safer car seats.

Nissan drew upon data from Nasa's Human Research Program at its Johnson Space Centre that had used experiments from space to examine the neutral body position of astronauts while they were sitting in low gravity.

Nissan used this to build seats for its cars that would lower the amount of fatigue drivers would feel and reduce pressure spots.

The Martian surface, seen here in this 'selfie' by Nasa's Mars rover Curiosity, is littered with rocks, deep sand and other obstacles that pose a threat to vehicles but technology developed for cars on Earth could help

Among the first steps in the new collaboration will be to map the roads around Nasa Ames Research Centre in California so that Nissan can test drive adapted autonomous versions of its Leaf electric vehicles (above)

Dr Maarten Sierhuis, director of Nissan's Silicon Valley Research Centre, who spent 12 years working as a senior scientist at Nasa Ames Research Centre, is thought to be the architect behind the latest collaboration.

He told Wired: 'This is a perfect blend of the capability of what the robotics folks at NASA Ames have and the autonomy that we bring.'

In the latest project engineers will begin by conducting online simulations before hoping to get an actual car on the road by the end of 2015.

Nasa's track record in building spacecraft and rovers that are reliable and have significant degrees of latent safety will be invaluable to building autonomous cars for use on Earth.

Nasa's Curiosity Rover, seen above in an artists impression, has a top speed of just 0.08mph as it needs to avoid obstacles but it is hoped that future rovers will be able to negotiate the Martian surface at higher speeds

There are some who fear that software glitches and mechanical faults in autonomous vehicles that share the road with human drivers could turn them into death traps.

However, Dr Worden added: 'All of our potential topics of research collaboration with Nissan are areas in which Ames has strongly contributed to major NASA programs.

'Ames developed Mars rover planning software, robots onboard the International Space Station and Next Generation air traffic management systems to name a few.

'We look forward to applying knowledge developed during this partnership toward future space and aeronautics endeavors.'

Carlos Ghosn, president and CEO of Nissan, added: 'The work of NASA and Nissan – with one directed to space and the other directed to earth, is connected by similar challenges.

'The partnership will accelerate Nissan's development of safe, secure and reliable autonomous drive technology that we will progressively introduce to consumers beginning in 2016 up to 2020.'

Some experts have raised concerns about how humans themselves will respond when sharing the road with autonomous vehicles.

A recent report by the Institution of Engineering and Technology highlighted research that showed human drivers change their behaviour when using the same roads as autonomous cars.

Motorists were found to copy the driving style of the computer controlled cars by leaving less space between them and the vehicle in front, but were less able to react quickly.

Now Google has realised that if it wants its driverless cars to be able to compete with pushy human drivers on the open road, they too need to be more assertive.

After testing its autonomous vehicles over 700,000 miles of public road, Google's engineers have tweaked the software that controls the cars to give them a slightly more aggressive edge.
