Jimmy Savile’s victims could be offered as little as £1,500 each in compensation by the BBC.

The paltry sum is the lowest of the seven tiers of payments to victims of the DJ and presenter proposed by the corporation.

It is about the same amount as the BBC’s director general is paid in a single day.

The £1,500 payment would be made to those who suffered a ‘minor assault’ at the hands of the paedophile, who preyed on youngsters in his dressing room and backstage.

The highest payment – only £40,000 – would go to those who were raped by Savile. One of his victims, who did not want to be named, described the BBC proposal as ‘pathetic’, adding: ‘Their top bosses get that kind of money in a few hours and they think it will compensate for a lifetime of psychological trauma? Put another couple of noughts on the end, people might be satisfied.’

Savile, who died in October 2011 aged 84, attacked hundreds of children he met at the BBC and at hospitals, charity events and schools.

Police believe the Top of the Pops and Jim’ll Fix It presenter attacked at least 1,300 people over the course of 54 years.

A year after his reign of terror was exposed the NSPCC children’s charity is still taking calls from people he targeted. Scotland Yard says Savile spent ‘every waking minute’ thinking about abusing children, and used his celebrity status to that end.

Victims of Savile have attacked the BBC's offer of compensation, arguing the £1,500 figure is about the same amount as the BBC¿s director general, Lord Hall, is paid in a single day

About 135 victims have launched legal proceedings against the BBC, the NHS, the now-defunct Duncroft school for girls in Surrey, and Savile’s £4.3million estate. The estate has been frozen in light of the allegations.

Lawyers for all sides are due to meet in a High Court hearing on October 21 to discuss the compensation proposals.

Under the BBC scheme, victims could be paid 25 per cent extra if Savile repeated the abuse, and another 25 per cent if it led to lifelong trauma, it is understood.

If the BBC’s proposals are accepted, it means the broadcaster and hospitals that failed to stop the serial predator could get away with relatively low compensation payouts.

They feared the scandal would cost them millions of pounds, but it seems likely they are facing a combined compensation bill of only two or three million pounds.

But the meagre amounts have split opinion among victims, with some branding them an insult, and others saying no amount would compensate for what Savile did. One victim told the Mail: ‘Whether it is £100 or £100,000, it doesn’t matter to me – the point is to get an acknowledgment they did wrong.

‘So many people knew what Savile was like but nobody stopped him. There were dozens of chances for them, but they let him go on attacking children until he was an old man. Jimmy Savile is dead, and this is the only way to get back at him.’

Victims said it was shocking it had taken so long to expose the DJ’s predatory behaviour, and believe senior managers who missed opportunities to stop him should be named and shamed.

The NSPCC said publicity surrounding the Savile case had also led to a more general surge in the number of child victims of sexual abuse making contact with them.

The number of referrals the NSPCC helpline has made to police and social services was up by 84 per cent in June and July compared with the same period in 2012.

The BBC’s director general, Lord Hall, who took up his post in the spring, is paid a salary of £450,000 a year, according to the BBC Trust.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘The parties remain in discussions. It would be inappropriate to make any further comment at this stage.’
