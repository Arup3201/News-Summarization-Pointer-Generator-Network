Most people will admit they have a dark side, but in the home of Star Wars super-fan Bill McBride, that side of the force is stronger than most.

Bill McBride, 42, boasts the world's largest collection of Darth Vader memorabilia and is on a 20-year mission to turn his bedroom into a museum dedicated to the Sith Lord.

Mr McBride, who has spent more than $270,000 on buying Darth Vader merchandise, has collected more than 60,000 items including figurines, artwork and replica lightsabers.

He has loved George Lucas' sci-fi movie series since he was five-years-old, but only began collecting Vader keepsakes in the 1980s.

He now plans to dedicate an entire room in his Washington DC home to storing the collection.

He said: 'The moment Darth Vader burst on screen in Star Wars, I was immediately a fan of the character.'

'But when you have the imposing, powerful presence of David Prowse, the other-worldly voice of James Earl Jones, all wrapped up in one of the coolest, most amazing costumes in movie history, you can't help but fall in love..'

Mr McBride, whose Darth collection contains everything from original movie props, pre-production items, original works of art and modern merchandise, said a 'market value' doesn't exist for some of his rarer items.

And although some of his items could fetch for up to $15,000, he's reluctant to part ways with his cherished relics, having even turned down the offer of a Porsche.

He said: 'I just had someone make one of the more interesting trade offers I've received over the years.

'A gentleman contacted me about trading for a select group of five or five items from my collection.

'Astonishingly, he offered the keys to his Porsche 911, but I turned him down, of course.'

Despite his best efforts, Mr McBride said the collection will never be complete as he looks forward to the new saga in the Star Wars franchise, Episode 7.

'The hobby of Star Wars collecting is mind bogglingly vast, and it's easy to get lost.

'But if anything has changed over the decades, I am more passionate today than when I started.

'Needless to say, the entire world is now becoming fully engaged in Star Wars mania again and I for one am dying to head back into that galaxy, far far away.'
