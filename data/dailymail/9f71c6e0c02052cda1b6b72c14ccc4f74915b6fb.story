A preliminary report detailing actor Harrison Ford's actions just seconds before he crash-landed his 1940s vintage plane on to a California golf course was today released by federal transport officials.

The document, issued by the National Transportation Safety Board, describes how the 72-year-old actor reported an engine failure shortly after taking off from Santa Monica  Airport last Thursday.

He then alerted air traffic controllers and turned back toward the airport, the report states. However, as he did so, the aircraft struck the top of a tall tree. Seconds later, it crashed to the ground.

The plane - which came to rest around 800 feet from the approach end of a runway at the airport -sustained 'substantial damage to both wings and the fuselage' in the smash,  the document states.

Bloodied: A preliminary report detailing actor Harrison Ford's actions just seconds before he crash-landed his 1940s vintage plane on to a California golf course was today released by federal transport officials.

Document: Ford then alerted air traffic controllers and turned back toward the airport, the report (pictured) states. However, as he did so, the aircraft struck the top of a tall tree. Seconds later, it crashed to the ground

Meanwhile, Ford, who played Han Solo in the original Star Wars series, suffered serious injuries, including a fractured pelvis and a broken ankle. However, he is expected to make a full recovery.

The preliminary report explains how the actor was flying his World War II-era training plane under visual flight rules on the day of the crash. This meant he did not need to submit a flight plan.

It added that 'visual meteorological conditions prevailed', but that following the aircraft's takeoff from runway 21, 'the pilot advised of an engine failure and requested an immediate return to the airport'.

Ford 'initiated a left turn back towards the airport; the airplane subsequently struck the top of a tall tree prior to impacting the ground in an open area of a golf course,' the report states.

It concludes: 'The airplane was recovered to a secure location for further examination.' The report was constructed 'using data from various sources' after 'a significant amount of investigative work'.

It does not detail why Ford's engine might have failed, causing him to plummet to the ground. A final report is expected to be released when NTSB officials have finished their inquiry into the crash.

Last week, dramatic pictures emerged showing Ford being carried away from Penmar Golf Course in Venice, Los Angeles, on a stretcher, his face covered in blood and his neck strapped into a brace.

First responders were also pictured wrapping bandages around his head. 'He was stunned a bit,' spinal surgeon Sanjay Khurana, who was playing golf at the course at the time, told ABC News.

He added: 'He was moaning and in pain. It was obvious by his face, it was Harrison Ford. I'm old enough, or young enough, to have watched all his 'Star Wars' films. So, it was obvious.'

A video also emerged showing horrified golfers gaping open-mouthed at the sky before running out of the way as Ford deliberately steered his 1942 Ryan Aeronautical ST3KR into the ground.

In a tweet late Thursday, Ford's son, Ben, said his famous father was 'battered, but OK.' Ford, an aviation enthusiast with years of flying under his belt, remains in hospital recovering from the crash.

His wife, Calista Flockhart has stayed close to his side. The 50-year-old actress emerged on Friday night appearing tired and emotionally drained following a bedside vigil that lasted several hours.

Flockhart was seen at the wheel of a black Lexus pulling out of the hospital parking garage with an older male companion. The former Ally McBeal star looked like she hadn't slept in a while.

Her face was make-up free, while her eyes were dark-circled and bleary from possible crying. Her light brown hair hung limply around her face and her manner of dress appeared simple and casual. 

Couple: Earlier this week, it was said Flockhart is strongly urging her husband (pictured with her in January) to call it quits on his passion for flying and stay grounded because he might not be so fortunate next time

Earlier this week, it was claimed that Flockhart is strongly urging her husband to call it quits on his passion for flying and stay grounded because he might not be so fortunate next time.

'Calista is devastated. Thank goodness Harrison is OK but it could have been much, much worse,' her friend told The Mirror. 'It is a worry for her and his children that he has this dangerous hobby.'

They added: 'Whether or not he will pilot a plane again remains to be seen but everyone around him certainly hopes he will take a break – or give it up for ever. It is ­obviously a huge worry.' 

Flockhart is not the only one voicing her concerns for the screen legend. Star Wars co-star Carrie Fisher has also urged him to 'take a break' following his plane crash and take it easy, it is said.

Addressing Ford, who also starred as Indiana Jones, she told PEOPLE magazine: 'I know you have incredible bounce back, please take a bounce break for awhile. Can I drive next time?'

Officials are currently inspecting the wreckage of the plane and  documents regarding its upkeep.

'The aircraft will be examined, the engine will be examined, the records of the aircraft will be examined and ultimately we'll submit a factual report,' Patrick Jones, of the NTSB said.

He added: 'The final report probably will not be out for a year.'
