A mother-of-two is today fighting for her life after being ‘scalped’ in a horrific go-karting accident on a night out with her children.

The 48-year-old woman also faces the possibility of being paralysed after she suffered ‘traumatic’ head and neck injuries at an indoor arena.

It is believed her hair became caught in the engine of the go-kart, snapping her head back and causing horrific wounds to her scalp.

The incident happened at The Garage leisure complex in Kilmarnock, Ayrshire, and the woman, from Cumnock, was first taken to Crosshouse Hospital, near Kilmarnock.

The horror accident happened at The Garage leisure complex in Kilmarnock, Ayshire on Wednesday

She was later transferred to the Southern General Hospital in Glasgow, which has a specialist unit for head injuries.

A Scottish Ambulance Service spokesman said: ‘We received a call for a 48-year-old female patient at 8.20pm on Wednesday, April 30. She was taken to Crosshouse Hospital at 9pm.

'She suffered traumatic injuries during a go- karting session. An external force caused the injuries, which included a serious head and neck trauma.’

Police were also called and East Ayrshire Council is carrying out an investigation.

The Garage, which also has a nightclub and a bowling alley, describes its indoor karting track experience as ‘the ultimate thrill’.

It declined to comment on the incident last night, but confirmed that bookings are still being taken for karting sessions.

Go-karts intended for the general public are often limited to speeds of around 16mph.

Most karts have a petrol engine mounted behind the driver which powers the vehicle’s rear wheels.

It is not clear if the woman was wearing a helmet when the accident occurred. Website pictures show people racing karts at The Garage wearing full-face helmets.

Paramedics rushed the mother-of-two to Crosshouse Hospital in Kilmarnock, before she was transferred to the Southern General Hospital in Glasgow, which has a specialist head injury unit

In 2012, a woman in Indiana lost more
 than half her scalp in a similar accident after her hair caught in the 
axle of a go-kart at Whiteland Raceway Park in Indianapolis. Shelbi 
Crouch also suffered a skull fractures and facial paralysis.

British schoolgirl Amy Rose Coxall was strangled in February 2010 when her scarf caught in the wheels of a go-kart.

The 15-year-old was celebrating the Chinese New Year on holiday in Hong Kong with friends when the accident happened.

In 2009, a teenager was strangled by her scarf in a go-karting accident at Peterborough Raceway Ltd in Cambridgeshire.

Eighteen-year-old Suzanne Cornwell was fatally injured when the scarf was caught in the engine.

Last night, a spokesman for Police 
Scotland said: ‘We were made aware that a 48-year-old woman had been 
injured at The Garage in Kilmarnock on April 30.

'She has serious head injuries and was transferred to the Southern General Hospital. The local authority is now investigating.’

The woman is understood to have been at The Garage with her children.

It is not clear how old they are but it is believed they had been karting and it was a last-minute decision for their mother to have a go, too.

East Ayrshire Council confirmed that a health and safety investigation had been launched.

A spokesman said: ‘Senior officers from environmental health have conducted a thorough investigation of the site.

'The officers will now present a report to the procurator fiscal.’

Carol Blanchard, secretary of the Association of Scottish Karting Clubs, said: ‘This type of accident is very unusual in Scotland.

'Our clubs all have to comply with the national health and safetystandards set by the Motorsports Association.

'Privately run tracks like these do not have the same nationally-enforced rules.

'There are only four certified tracks in Scotland which are overseen by thenational guidelines.’
