A deranged Michigan man fired shots outside of a local city hall and police department before he led police on a chase where he was gunned down and killed in a shootout.

The shooting in Belding, Michigan, happened at about 5.23am on Saturday after a local police officer and a state police trooper stopped the man's white Econoline van.

The officers ordered the suspect out of his van. He then exited and began shooting at the patrol cars, state police 1st lieutenant Kevin Sweeney said during a press conference.

Investigating: Police investigate the scene where a Belding, Michigan, police officer shot and killed the man on Saturday, January 5, 2013

The suspect did not have identification on him, said Sweeney.

A family member told 24 Hour News 8 that the man who shot at authorities was Bud Rowley Jr., a 55-year-old from the Greenville, Michigan, area.

An autopsy will not be performed until Monday to establish positive identification.

An officer working inside the department heard the gunshots, went outside to investigate, found the broken window and saw the man getting into a van, Sweeney said.

The window of a Belding police cruiser was also shot out, he said.

A 15-year veteran of the Belding police department returned fire, striking and killing the man, according to MLive.

The unnamed Belding officer has been placed on paid administrative leave until the investigation is completed and the officer is cleared to return to work.

The Belding officer and the state trooper were unharmed.

It was the first-ever officer-involved shooting in Belding.
