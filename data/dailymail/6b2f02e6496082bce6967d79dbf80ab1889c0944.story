An 18-year-old girl has been reported missing after a suspicious house fire caused by a couch which went up in flames.

Brookelyn Farthing was last seen at a home on Saturday in Berea, Kentucky. Around an hour after she was last seen, a fire gutted the living room of the house.

The teenager's belongings, including her backpack, were found at the property but her cellphone was not among them.

The teenager's parents have been ringing her phone but no one answers.

The home is believed to belong to a male 
friend of Miss Farthing's ex-boyfriend and had been without electricity 
for several weeks, according to investigators.

Kentucky State Police are trying to 
determine what caused the fire in central Kentucky and whether it is 
related to the disappearance of the teenager.

Arson investigators are trying to discern how a fire started without electricity to power, for example, a lamp that might have fallen on to the sofa or caused an electrical short.

Madison County Fire Department Sgt. Harvey Baxter in Lexington said that investigators are treating the two incidents as separate for the moment.

The family of Miss Farthing however believes the two incidents are related. The teenage girl's desperately worried parents made a public appeal for her safe return on Monday.

Her mother told wtvq.com: 'We want her safe and if somebody's got her, please bring her back to us.'

Her father Randal Walker added: 
'It’s not just us, if someone’s got her, it’s not just us that you’re 
going to have to pay, it’s God that’s going to deal with you.'

Sgt Baxter says Miss Farthing will be entered into the police computer system and 'hopefully she'll show up'.

Miss Farthing, who has just graduated from Madison Southern High School, did not live at the house. The person who does live in the home gave a statement to investigators.

There were no suspects or persons of interest at this time. Miss Farthing is 5ft 1inch with blond hair and brown eyes.
