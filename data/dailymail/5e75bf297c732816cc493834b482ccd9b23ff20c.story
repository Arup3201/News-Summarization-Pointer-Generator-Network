Lewis Hamilton feared marshals could have been killed when they rushed on to the track at Hockenheim to clear away a stranded car.

Adrian Sutil’s Sauber spun to a stop on the start-finish straight towards the end of the German Grand Prix, but race officials decided not to bring out the safety car.

Instead, three marshals had to time their run on to the track to avoid drivers hurtling around the corner.

‘I was really concerned for the marshals – really concerned,’ said Hamilton. ‘You come around that corner at serious speed and then there are marshals not far from where you are driving. It felt like the closest thing I have seen for a long, long time.’

Hamilton said the danger triggered memories of watching a video of the 1977 South African Grand Prix when Welshman Tom Price drove into a marshal who was running on the track with a fire extinguisher.

‘That was the first thing I thought about,’ he added. ‘I couldn’t believe it. I was worried about the marshals.

'Fortunately, no one got hurt. I came round the corner and Sutil was part way through his spin. I was up on the Astroturf a little bit to stay out of the way.’
