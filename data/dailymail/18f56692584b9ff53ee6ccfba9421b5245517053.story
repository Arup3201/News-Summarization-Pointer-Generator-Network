Jose Mourinho criticised Newcastle's ball boys and accused them of wasting time after Chelsea's 2-1 defeat at St James' Park on Saturday.

Mourinho, who is yet to taste a league victory at Newcastle in his two stints as Chelsea boss, felt his side were unfortunate to lose and suggested the Magpies employed time-wasting tactics to get over the line.

Papiss Cisse came off the bench to score both goals in the second half, and Didier Drogba's late header wasn't enough to prevent Chelsea from falling to their first defeat of the season.

'No complaints. Unlucky,' he said. 'We had a lot of chances to score in the first half, we didn't. In the second half again we had chances, we didn't (score).

'They defend and the first time they were there (in attack) they score a goal. After that, everybody (got) behind (the ball) against a team that tried everything and a team (in which) every player went to the last seconds.

'We wanted to play more football but it was not possible because a few things I thought didn't belong any more to top-level football but still belongs - the ball disappeared, the ball doesn't come, another ball comes, the ball boys run away - these kind of situations that unfortunately are still part of the game. But no complaints.'

Chelsea fell to their first Premier League defeat in 15 games this season

Nemanja Matic could make an immediate return after suspension for Chelsea's Champions League clash with Sporting Lisbon on Wednesday.

Chelsea boss Mourinho allowed Matic to enjoy a 'holiday' while forced to sit out Saturday's defeat.

Serbia midfielder Matic lost his record of starting all Chelsea's Barclays Premier League games after picking up his fifth booking of the season in the 3-0 victory over Tottenham.

Mourinho could well rotate his squad for Sporting's Stamford Bridge visit, with Chelsea already assured of top spot in Group G and safe passage to the last 16.

'He has a little bit of a holiday, a free weekend that he deserves very, very much: and he will come back stronger,' said Mourinho of Matic.

'If one player has a free weekend for example, obviously he is ready to play again three or four more matches in a row.

'I keep saying that I think it's very, very difficult for a player to play every game in December.

'So if we have eight matches, I would say the maximum a player can play is seven.'
