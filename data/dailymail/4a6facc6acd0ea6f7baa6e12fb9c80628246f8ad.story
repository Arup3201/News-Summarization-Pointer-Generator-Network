Two high school students from Toronto took sued their school principal after they were forced to undergo a breath test at their prom last summer.

The Northern Secondary School students went to court after headteacher, Ron Felsen, demanded that all the teenagers who attended the end-of-year party be breathalyzed.

The Superior Court ruled in the students' favor stating mandatory breath testing would infringe on their constitutional rights.

Taking a stand: Simon Gillies, left, and Brett Gorski, right headed up the student council at Toronto's Northern Secondary School and  took their principal to court to fight compulsory breath testing at prom, and won!

The judge in the case ruled on the side of the students saying that they had a reasonable expectation of privacy and reminded teachers that schools simply do not have the authority to conduct such a type of search.

Civil litigation lawyer, Jonathan Lisus, who acted on behalf of the students'  said the ruling would set a precedent.

Mr Lisus said it was more than just about alcohol at school proms but that it was affect the law of the land. 

'This was an important confirmation of the role of the charter in a free and democratic society,' he said.

The furor began when Principal Felsen decided to introduce compulsory breath testing at prom without alerting the school council.

The thinking was, that random breath testing would curb the numbers of students being drunk school parties which in the past had seen a number of party-goers end up in hospital. 

Best interests: Principal Rob Felsen said  mandatory breath testing was a 'last resort' to counteract a culture of intoxication at school dances, which had seen two of his students hospitalized in recent years

Blow out! Principal Felsen wrote a letter to the school community stating that Breathalyzers would not be used at any upcoming proms

Felsen said that the idea was not only meant to identify those who were intoxicated, but to also act as a deterrent 

'We want students to enjoy themselves at prom, but we have to make sure they are enjoying themselves within the law,' he told the Toronto Star.

Students Brett Gorski and Simon Gillies, the president and vice-president of the school council, disagreed with the decision.

Moreover the pair were simply irked that the headteacher had not consulted with the student body first. 

The Canadian Civil Liberties Association were contacted for guidance and a lawsuit was brought against Felsen and the Toronto District School Board last May.

On the night of the prom, with the lawsuit pending, the school dropped its idea to roll out breath testing.

No students were kicked out for being drunk and disorderly.  

Ms Gorski, 18, told the Toronot Star she was 'thrilled' with the ruling. 

'Students deserve to know that they have rights and, despite their age, they have the power to defend themselves,' she said.

Their lawyer, Mr Lisus, was also suitably impressed with the outcome.  

'That is exactly the kind of behaviour we should be encouraging in our young people and that is exactly the reason why we shouldn't be applying mass randomized searches to students. It's the wrong way to teach them about fundamental values and the way to resolve differences of opinions in democracy.'

Felsen wrote a letter to the school community Monday evening outlining the court's decision and stating that Breathalyzers would not be used at any upcoming proms.
