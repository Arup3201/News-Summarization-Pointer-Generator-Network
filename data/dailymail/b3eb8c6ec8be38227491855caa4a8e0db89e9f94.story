West Ham starlet Reece Oxford was named as a substitute for their Capital One Cup tie against Sheffield United on Tuesday night.

The defender was fast-tracked to the Hammers' Under-18 side last season and has already made two appearances for the Under-21 team this year.

He has also played at youth level for England, and is expected to get an opportunity under Sam Allardyce in the near future.

Oxford has been watched by scouts from several top clubs, including Arsenal and Chelsea.

But Manchester United are believed to be the club with the most active interest in the young star, with Louis van Gaal looking to bring in young talent to the club.

West Ham have fast-tracked Oxford to the first team in the hope that playing at a higher level will help keep him at the club.

Speaking this summer West Ham co-owner David Sullivan spoke of the club's intention to keep Oxford.

Sullivan blasted England's top sides for continually poaching the lesser clubs' best talent, and insisted that Oxford would stay at Upton Park for the foreseeable future. 

'It almost makes you give up on having an academy if they can come in and nick your best 15-year-old. What's the point?,' Sullivan said.  

Promotion: Having played a few times for the U-18s last season, Oxford is now an U-21 regular

Future star: The 15-year-old was already signing autographs for West Ham fans before the game
