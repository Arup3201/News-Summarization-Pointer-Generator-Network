Kings of Leon today cancelled the remainder of their U.S. tour.

A statement released by the rock band claims the lead singer Caleb Followill, who recently married Victoria's Secret model Lily Aldridge, is suffering from 'exhaustion'. 

It comes three days after he angered fans in Dallas, Texas, by abruptly walking out mid-concert because it was 'too hot.'

A string of tweet by the band after Friday night's disastrous performance hinted at mounting disharmony between the group.

Bizarre behaviour: The Kings of Leon have cancelled their entire U.S. tour four days after Caleb Followill (pictured) walked off stage complaining he was 'too hot'

A spokesperson said today: 'We are so
sorry to say Kings of Leon are cancelling their entire US tour due to 
Caleb Followill suffering from vocal issues and exhaustion.'

'The band is devastated, but in order
to give their fans the shows they deserve, they need to take this 
break. 

'Unfortunately, the US dates cannot be rescheduled due to the 
band's international tour schedule.'

'Utterly depressed': Jared Followill today tweeted about the cancellation and joked about the band breaking up

After performing about four songs on Friday, the lead singer started complaining about losing his voice and asking the audience to help him sing.

'If you guys would please help me sing, I'd love it,' he begged.

About 50 minutes into the show the rocker told the shocked audience at the Gexa Energy Pavilion he needed a break.

'I'm gonna go backstage for a second and I'm gonna vomit,' he said. 'I'm gonna drink a beer and I'm gonna play three more songs.'

Rift: Caleb's brother Jared Followill apologised to fans after Friday's show and hinted at deeper problems within the group

Caleb, however, did not reappear, leaving his bandmates to apologise to the crowd.

'Caleb's
just a little unfit to play the rest of the show,' they said. 'We love 
you guys so much. I know you guys f***ing hate us. I'm so sorry.'

They added: 'It's really not out fault - it's Caleb. He can't play the rest of the show. We will be back as soon as possible.'

Comments
made on Twitter by Caleb's brother and the band's bass guitarist Jared 
Followill, however, suggested there was more to Caleb's problems that 
met the eye.

'Dallas, I
cannot begin to tell you how sorry I am. There are internal sicknesses 
& problems that have needed to be addressed,' he wrote on Saturday.

He
added: 'I love out fans so much. I know you guys aren't stupid. I can't
lie. There are problems in our band bigger than not drinking enough 
Gatorade.'

Drummer Nathan Followill echoed his brother's sentiment.

'Ashamed & embarrassed by last night's fiasco,' he tweeted. 'Can't apologise enough, utterly gutted.'

Today Jared was back on Twitter to share his disappointment over the cancelled tour saying he was 'uttterly depressed'.

Trouble: The band have rescheduled, but furious fans have taken to social networking sites to slate their behaviour

He
added: 'It's completely out of my hands. Family has to come 1st. If 
base solos & backing vocals were more popular, I'd be there.'

But told fans he said he'd spend the time song writing.

He also made a joke about the band breaking up, only to insist he was 'kidding'.

The Kings of Leon rep said people who had tickets for the band's remaining US shows would be refunded.

They are expected to resume their tour in Canada on September 28th.

The Nashville-based group, which is known for hits including the Grammy-winning anthem 'Use Somebody,' is also known for its history of squabbles and bizarre behaviour.

Last
year the band pulled the plug half way through a concert in St Louis, 
Missouri after their bass player was pooped on by pigeons.

Jared had been hit several times already when a particularly large splat landed on his face near his mouth.

That proved too much for the rockers, who fled the stage just three songs into their set.

In 2009 the band members were also involved in a drunken backstage bust-up with each other at the Brit Awards, according to witnesses.

A host of stars milling around the dressing room area including U2 and David Hasselhoff, watched as the band, who are all related, started brawling.
