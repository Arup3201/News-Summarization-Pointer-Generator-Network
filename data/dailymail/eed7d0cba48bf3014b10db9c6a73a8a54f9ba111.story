Cat burglars carried out a ‘Pink Panther’ style robbery on the home of a British actress in Rome, making off with Euro 50,000 worth of jewellery.

Actress Katy Saunders, who starred in the Hollywood film Lizzie McGuire, and appeared alongside George Clooney in the iconic Nespresso adverts, returned to her luxury apartment near the Foro Italico on Saturday to find it ransacked and her collection of gold and jewels missing.

Police said that the thieves were a ‘gang of acrobats’, who were capable of scaling the building, manoeuvring along a thin water pipe and using the grates of windows belonging to other apartments before entering the apartment.

On arriving home the 30-year-old actress and model who has lived in Rome for four years found the locks picked and immediately called emergency services.

Investigators have examined footprints left in the condominium and launched a search of gypsy encampments in the area.

It is not the first time the Pink Panther style thieves have struck in this exclusive quarter of Rome popular with VIPs. In the past they have taken jobs as gardeners in order to monitor the house then scaled entire buildings to reach penthouse suites belonging to stars.

Earlier this year a cat burglar fell to his death from a third floor balcony when a railing gave way during an attempted robbery in Rome. 

The Albanian man, aged 38, was wearing a balaclava and was carrying ‘a burglary kit’ including a torch in his pockets.
