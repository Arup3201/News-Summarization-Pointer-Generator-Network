Labour could be dead in ten years, one of Ed Miliband’s closest advisers warns.

Policy co-ordinator Jon Cruddas said the party could ‘disintegrate in real time’ because traditional supporters were splintering off to increasingly successful smaller parties.

It comes as Mr Miliband’s party, which was formed in 1900, languishes in the polls as Labour voters defect to the Greens or SNP.

Labour dead in ten years? The remarks will embarrass leader Ed Miliband (left) because policy co-ordinator Jon Cruddas (right) is meant to be rebuilding the party in the wake of New Labour

The remarks will embarrass Mr Miliband because Mr Cruddas is meant to be rebuilding the party in the wake of New Labour.

During a debate on digital democracy, Mr Cruddas was asked whether Labour might go the same way as social democratic parties in Greece and Spain, which have been overtaken by radical anti-austerity movements.

Asked whether Labour could be gone within a decade, Mr Cruddas replied: ‘Yes, yes. There is no safe ground for any orthodox parties, and the stakes could be high potentially.

‘They could just disintegrate in real time – and I include the party I represent.’

Labour’s biggest individual donor: John Mills (pictured) believes Mr Miliband’s flagship tuition fees policy will destabilise universities and not help working-class children

Last night it emerged Labour’s biggest individual donor believes Mr Miliband’s flagship tuition fees policy will destabilise universities and not help working-class children.

Question to the Chancellor: Ed Balls has refused 13 times to rule out a post-election deal with the SNP

John Mills told The Daily Telegraph there were ‘redistributive problems’ with cutting fees to £6,000 a year, and warned it could hurt Labour’s economic credibility.

The founder of shopping channel firm JML also said the party was likely to fall short of a majority.

It marks the biggest internal challenge to Labour’s tuition fees position since Mr Miliband revealed the proposals a fortnight ago.

Mr Mills said: ‘What it’s doing is helping middle-class rather than working-class children.’

Meanwhile, Ed Balls refused 13 times to rule out a post-election deal with the SNP yesterday.

Despite a growing clamour for Labour to reject any power-sharing with the SNP, the Shadow Chancellor dodged repeated questions on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show.

He said: ‘It is not part of our plans. I’m not going to get involved in speculation about post-election deals.’
