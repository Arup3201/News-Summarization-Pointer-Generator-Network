One store owner from Georgia was so offended by customers with baggy pants that he decided to rile his patrons even more by posting a homophobic slur on a sign outside.

The sign read, 'Pull your pants up or be proud to be a f@$,' and even though the owner Anil Patel is proud to has come up with the controversial catchphrase, many customers say they won't be visiting the PCA Food Store on Hogansville Road again.

'I couldn’t believe they put something like that up,' said customer Joshua Southern to WSBTV, who said he'll no longer visit the store.

Owner of the PCA Food Store in Lagrange meant to deter baggy pants wearers from entering his store but he has offended some customers

Anil Patel, manager of PCA, says the sign was not meant to offend anyone. He says he hung it inside and outside the store because he was tired of customers coming in with sagging pants

'There is other ways to deal with it. You could say, "Pull your pants up. Nobody wants to see your butt, Southern said.

'I came up with that sign, nobody else did,' said Anil Patel.

'It doesn’t bother me, not a bit. I have a girlfriend and I am gay,' said Kerrie Williams, a clerk at the store who in un-phased by the sign.

'Since that sign went up there, I don’t see no pants down in my store, because they read the sign and they decide what they want to be.'

WSBTV reports that late on Thursday night the owner's father pulled the signs down but the owner, who was out of town, said that he would put the signs back up.

Some customers supported the owner and said things like '“Ain’t nobody want to see all that. I don’t want to see no grown man with they pants down.'

The owner claims that even though his sign includes a gay slur, that he is not homophobic and the sign is not meant to offend gay people.

'It really offends me by them coming in, pants down. So it is not that I’m against them, gay people or anything like that, but just trying to prove a point. If you are going to come in my store, make sure you have your pants on,' Patel said.

Patel is so proud of his sign that he plans to make and sell bumper stickers with the same saying.

"If you look at little kids walking around with their pants down, what are you trying to prove? What are you really trying to prove? You're disrespecting people," said Patel to WRBL.

While some don't mind the sign outside the of the PCA on Hogansville Road, others vow not to visit the store as long as the sign is still outside of it
