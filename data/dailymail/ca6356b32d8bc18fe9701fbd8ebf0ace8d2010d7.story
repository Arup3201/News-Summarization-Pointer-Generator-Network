Iran's hopes of progressing to the last 16 of this summer's World Cup were ended by a Bosnia side who had already been eliminated.

Manchester City striker Edin Dzeko put Safet Susic's side into the lead as his drilled effort in the 22nd minute went in via the post.

Bosnia doubled their lead through Roma playmaker Miralem Pjanic who stroked the ball into the back of the net just before the hour mark.

Reza Ghoochannejhad pulled a goal back for Carlos Queiroz's side with ten minutes to go but any hopes of an incredible comeback were soon dashed as right-back Avdija Vrsajevic extended Bosnia's lead almost instantly.

Host commentator

So a Bosnia victory sees Nigeria progress to the last 16 with Group F winners Argentina.

Iran battled hard but you can't really expect to go though with just a single goal in three matches.

Both managers, Iran's Carlos Quieroz and Bosnia's Safet Susic, are expected to step down following their side's elimination.

Sportsmail will keep you updated with any developments.

Thanks for joining us.

Iran frontman Karim is booked having gone down rather easily in the box.

The referee is wise to it and produces the yellow card.

Edin Dzeko's World Cup is over as he is replaced by Edin Visca.

That's surely game over as Bosnia go up the end of the field to score.

Right-back Vrsajevic makes up for his earlier miss by extending his side's lead with eight minutes to go.

Iran launch a cross along the six-yard box and Ghoochannejhad is on hand to tap home.

Is this the start of an incredible comeback? I doubt it.

...but the Charlton frontman's powerful left-foot effort is well blocked by the Bosnia defence

Tino Sven Susic makes way for Sejad Salihovic

Besic is booked for a late challenge on Heydari.

Iran need three goals in the final fifteen minutes to keep their World Cup hopes alive.

Unfortunately a Bosnia goal looks more likely.

Karim Ansari Fard replaces Ashkan Dejagah.

The Fulham midfielder has worked hard this evening.

Wideman Alireza Jahanbakhsh comes on for defender Ehsan Haji Safi.

Midfielder Anel Hadzic is replaced by defender Ognjen Vranjes.

Huge setback for Iran as Bosnia double their lead.

Roma midfielder Miralem Pjanic latches on to Dzeko' through ball and coolly places the ball home. Very impressive finish.

Very much 'what could have been' for the Bosnians. A more than capable side.

Ten minutes in to the second half and it's all Iran so far.

Ashkan Dejagah goes close but skews his effort as the linesman calls for offside to spare the blushes of the Fulham man.

Defender Marcos Rojo heads Argentina back into the lead to give Iran hope.

Ahmed Musa scores his second of the evening to draw Nigeria level.

As it stands, an Iranian victory would still not be enough to see Carlos Quieroz's side through.

Iran have never beaten a European side at the World Cup.

However, they have scored SIXTEEN goals in five matches against Bosnia.

Khosro Heydari comes on Masoud Shojaei at the start of the second half.

Iran still have a chance of going through.

However, they MUST beat Bosnia so need two goals.

No problem for a side who are yet to score so far at this World Cup.

With nothing to play for, Bosnia lead Iran courtesy of Dzeko's strike after 22 minutes.

You guessed it... Messi scores for Argentina.

The Barcelona star scores a sublime free-kick to put his team back in front.

Click the above link for updates from the game.

Right-back Avdija Vrsajevic drags the ball wide with a shot when he could have easily played the ball across the six-yard box and into the path of Dzeko.

Bosnia's decision-making, particularly in the final third, have cost them this tournament.

The Bosnia captain has seemingly shaken off that knock and has returned to the field almost instantly.

FUN FACT: Spahic is the first cousin of international team-mate Edin Dzeko.

Spahic has been taken off on a stretcher for the time-being.

We'll see if he is able to return to the action but it must be said he did look like he was in some considerable pain.

As mentioned previously, should Bosnia have started with two up-front for the majority of this tournament?

Iran almost respond immediately as Shojaei rifles a shot against the crossbar.

Asmir Begovic stood no chance!

The goal-line technology replays are shown but there was no need - never over the line.

That's been coming!

Edin Dzeko drills the ball home from distance and it cannons in off the post. 1-0.

Perfect precision from the striker.

The three previous games played in Salvador during this World Cup have produced 17 goals.

Alas, I fear the city’s free-scoring reputation may take a nosedive this afternoon.

Masoud Shojaei took a powerful Miralem Pjanic free-kick to the chest and was clearly in agony as he rolled around on the floor.

Luckily the Las Palmas midfielder is back on his feet and able to continue.

Dzeko has made a lively start to this game but his header is easily saved.

So, there'll be no drawing of lots - Ahmed Musa equalises for the Super Eagles after just four minutes.

The Man City frontman lashed a shot on target but Haghighi in the Iran goal did well to get good hand on the ball to tip it over.

Lionel Messi fires Argentina ahead after two minutes.

Nigeria 0-1 Argentina.

Remember, if Iran win 1-0 and Nigeria lose by the scoreline both sides will have identical Group F records.

If this happens, FIFA will draw lots in the Maracana 90 minutes after the final whistle to decide which team progresses.

 

Carlos Quieroz was known as a hard taskmaster at Manchester United, introducing regular double-training sessions when he was Sir Alex Ferguson’s No2.

So perhaps we shouldn't be surprised Iran are extremely well-drilled in this World Cup.

Bosnia: Begovic, Vrsajevic, Sunjic, Spahic, Kolasinac, Hadzic, Pjanic, Besic, Susic, Dzeko, Ibisevic.

Subs: Fejzic, Bicakcic, Vranjes, Misimovic, Mujdza, Lulic, Ibricic, Medunjanin, Visca, Hajrovic, Salihovic, Avdukic.

Iran: Alireza Haghighi, Hosseini, Sadeghi, Montazeri, Pouladi, Teymourian, Nekounam, Dejagah, Shojaei, Hajsafi, Ghoochannejhad.

Subs: Ahmadi, Heydari, Reza Haghighi, Jahanbakhsh, Ansarifard, Hadadifar, Mahini, Alnameh, Rahmani, Beikzadeh, Beitashour,Davari.

Referee: Carlos Velasco Carballo (Spain)

So Bosnia manager has reverted to a 4-4-2 formation having initially stuck with 4-5-1 for his side's opening two World Cup matches.

Man City frontman Edin Dzeko, who has played as the sole frontman so far in this tournament, is joined in attack by Vedad Ibisevic.

The Stuttgart striker's introduction against Argentina had the desired impact as the forward found the net.

Perhaps Bosnia would still have a chance of going through had they played with two strikers all along... we'll see how they do this evening.

Alireza Haghighi, Hosseini, Sadeghi, Montazeri, Pouladi, Teymourian, Nekounam, Dejagah, Shojaei, Hajsafi, Ghoochannejhad.

Begovic, Vrsajevic, Sunjic, Spahic, Kolasinac, Hadzic, Pjanic, Besic, Susic, Dzeko, Ibisevic.

 

Tonight could be very interesting...

Should Iran claim a 1-0 victory and Nigeria lose to Argentina by the same scoreline both teams will finish the group stage with IDENTICAL records.

Therefore, FIFA will flip a coin or draw lots to decide which team goes through.

No team has ever been eliminated from a World Cup by the drawing of lots.

Iran need a win against Bosnia and will progress to the last 16 should Nigeria lose to Argentina.

Bosnia have already been eliminated and so only have pride to play for in this final Group F fixture.
