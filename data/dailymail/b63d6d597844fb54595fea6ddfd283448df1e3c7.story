A quick-thinking Canadian woman has been diagnosed with a stroke after she filmed herself suffering the symptoms - after doctors previously insisted she was simply stressed.

Stacey Yepes, 49, from Thornhill, Ontario, recognized her numbness and partial facial paralysis as signs of having a stroke, so she went to the ER - but doctors sent her away with advice on how to manage stress.

'They told me I needed 
to learn how to manage my stress,' she told CNN. 'I just laughed to myself and thought, "This is not stress". I couldnt believe that was the diagnosis they came 
up with.'

Quick thinking: Stacey Yepes grabbed her camera when her face became partially paralyzed and she suffered tingles over her body. Doctors had told her she was simply stressed but she thought it was a stroke

Struggle: The 49-year-old also showed how it was tough for her to use her left hand during the episode

But two days later, the numbness returned as she was driving - so she pulled over and grabbed her smartphone.

'The sensation is happening again,' she says in the video. 'It's all tingling on 
left side.'

She then tries to lift her left arm but says she finds it hard to point at specific things, like her nose.

She also films herself following the advice of the doctors to breathe in and out slowly to manage her stress, but the symptoms persist.

Relief: Yepes showed doctors the footage and they concluded she had suffered several mini strokes. She is taking time off work and taking medication to prevent any future strokes

The Heart and Stroke Foundation gives five warning signs of stroke:

Weakness: Sudden loss of strength, numbness in face, arm or leg, even if it's only temporary

Trouble speaking: Sudden difficulty talking or understanding spoken language, even if temporary

Vision problems: Sudden trouble with vision, even if temporary

Headache: Sudden severe or unusual headache

Dizziness: Sudden loss of balance, especially with any of the above signs.

Doctors advise people to dial 911 at the first sign of a stroke.

'I think it was just to show somebody, 
because I knew it was not stress-related,' she told CBC. 'And I thought if I could show somebody what was happening, they would 
have a better understanding.'

Afterwards,
 she went to Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto - a different hospital from
 her first visit - and was referred to Toronto Western Hospital's stroke
 center.

Doctors
 there concluded that Yepes was having a transient ischemic attack or 
TIA, which is also called a mini-stroke.

She told CNN each one had 
lasted between seven and 10 minutes.

She had an MRI scan and the stroke team identified a small injury.

They determined that her mini strokes were caused by a buildup of plaque in her arteries, and a blood clot then formed on the plaque, blocking an artery leading to her brain.

Although she only suffered temporary mini strokes, they are a sign that a full-blown stroke could be around the corner.

'In
 all my years treating stroke patients, weâ€™ve never seen anyone tape 
themselves before,' Dr Cheryl Jaigobin, the stroke neurologist at 
the hospital's Krembil Neuroscience Centre, told CBC.

'Her symptoms were 
compelling, and the fact she stopped and found a way to portray them in 
such a visual fashion, we were all touched by it.'

Yepes, a legal secretary in Toronto, told CNN she was 'feeling good' and is now being monitored and taking medication. She has been off work but hopes to return in July.
