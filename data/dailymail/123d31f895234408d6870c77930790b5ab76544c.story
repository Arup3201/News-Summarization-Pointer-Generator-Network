Calmly strolling through a busy Tube station, the man in the leather jacket could be on his way home from work, or heading out for a drink with friends.

In fact, police believe he is on a mission to murder. He is the main suspect in a hunt for the gunman who blasted a Russian banker six times outside his luxury flat.

German Gorbuntsov, 46, was sprayed with bullets outside his Docklands apartment by a hooded hitman in a botched assassination which left him disabled.

Scotland Yard revealed yesterday that 
they were pursuing significant new leads after releasing footage of the 
suspect in the shooting.

CCTV images show the man casually 
dressed, wearing a black jacket with its  collar pulled up and blue 
jeans, coolly  walking through Canary Wharf station and mingling with 
dozens of commuters on their way home on a Tuesday evening.

Just moments earlier, Mr Gorbuntsov, 
an exiled financier who was in hiding in London, was gunned down on his 
doorstep after stepping out of a taxi which dropped him off at his 
exclusive apartment block at 7.20pm on March 20.

The 46-year-old was shot six times 
with a specially modified 9mm Russian semi-automatic pistol rarely seen 
in Britain, which has been described by weapons experts as a 
‘professional assassin’s weapon’.

The victim collapsed to the ground, blood pouring from his chest and stomach as his hooded attacker fled on foot.

His mistress, Natasha Semchenkova, 36,
was seen crying hysterically and making phone calls as paramedics 
battled to save Mr Gorbuntsov’s life.

Astonishingly, he survived the attack because all the bullets missed vital organs.

Suspects: As part of a Crimewatch appeal police 
want to track down these two men, left and right, seen here on the night
of the shooting

Going out: The man, with a bag, makes his way out of Canary Wharf tube station moments before shooting

Yesterday the businessman, who is 
still recovering under armed guard in hospital amid fears of another 
attempt on his life, told how he came face to face with his would-be 
killer.

He told BBC Crimewatch: ‘The worst feeling is that guy shot me and ran away and probably very much hoped he had killed me.

‘This incident has changed my whole life.’

Mr Gorbuntsov added: ‘They found six 
bullets inside me. I was badly injured and badly affected. I have 
serious internal damage to my body and I still haven’t seen a single 
doctor who is absolutely convinced it will be fine.

‘I will make it but I will be disabled. My future is uncertain.’

Scotland Yard released CCTV images of 
the suspect, described as white, 6ft tall and slim, fleeing the flats on
Byng Street wearing a dark hooded top.

He is thought to have run towards the Marsh Wall area where he dumped the weapon and his blood-spattered clothing.

Police found a hooded top in the 
bushes nearby, along with the 9mm Makarov pistol complete with a 
specially adapted silencer and a black fake leather bag that the man had
been seen carrying on CCTV moments earlier as he exited Canary Wharf 
station at 7.08pm.

Just after 7.30pm, the same man was seen entering the
station, this time wearing a leather jacket, but with no bag.

Evidence: This Soviet military Makarov 9mm pistol was found dumped after the attack in March

Officers have also released CCTV 
images thought to be of the same man wearing a hooded top in the area 
the day before the shooting. Detective Chief Inspector Russell Taylor, 
who is leading the hunt for the assassin, said: ‘The gun, a 9mm Makarov 
pistol, is highly unusual and is rarely used in Britain.’

Yesterday a spokesman for Scotland 
Yard said they had already received several calls following the 
Crimewatch appeal on Thursday night. He added: ‘We are working on those 
names now, to see if we can find anything out.’

He revealed that police already have a
full DNA profile of the attacker and they also have Russian-speaking 
officers to assist the inquiry.

Attack: This is the doorway to the exclusive block of flats in Docklands where German Gorbuntsov, an exile in Britain, was shot

Detectives are liaising with their 
counterparts in Moscow for the first time since Alexander Litvinenko, a 
former KGB agent, was poisoned with polonium-210 in a London hotel in 
2006.

Mr Gorbuntsov made a fortune in 
banking and construction post-Communist Russia, but he also acquired 
enemies and fled Moscow in 2010.

There are several theories surrounding
the attack, including a Russian police investigation into the shooting 
of Mr Gorbuntsov’s business partner, tens of millions missing from 
Russia’s state railway, armed Chechen gangs and allegations of 
embezzlement and the illegal takeover of a bank in neighbouring Moldova.

The victim believes the assassination 
attempt is directly linked to his intention to provide evidence against 
former associates over the 2009 shooting of a financier in  Moscow and 
the alleged embezzlement of billions of roubles from Russia’s state 
railways.

Mr Gorbuntsov is seeking asylum in Britain for both his ‘wives’ and their children.

He believes it is too dangerous for his wife Larisa, 46, and their son Vladislav, 26, to return to Moscow.

He is also seeking political asylum 
for his long-time Russian girlfriend, with whom he was living when he 
was shot, and their two-year-old son.
