England eased past Qatar in their opening game of the Toulon Tournament but their match on Monday evening is at the opposite end of the scale.

The Young Lions face the might of Brazil, a formidable challenge at any level of international football.

Manager Gareth Southgate insists they are not in France to make up the numbers, and Sportsmail takes a look at who could be lining up for both sides.

England (probable, 4-2-3-1)

Jack Butland

Age 21, Goalkeeper, Stoke City (previously at Birmingham City, loan spells at Cheltenham Town, Barnsley, Leeds United), U20 Caps 4, U21 Caps 19, England caps 1.

The high-rated keeper has been tipped as England’s future No 1 ever since he made his Birmingham debut in 2010 but, after a move to Stoke in 2013, has yet to establish himself in the full squad despite making a senior appearance against .

That's mine! Jack Butland is set to keep goal for England Under 21s against Brazil on Monday night

Ben Gibson

Age 21, Right-Back, Middlesbrough (loan spells at Plymouth Argyle, York City, Tranmere Rovers), U20 Caps 1, U20 Goals 0, U21 Caps 0, U21 Goals 0.

The nephew of Boro chairman Steve Gibson, Gibson is a versatile defender who can operate at centre-back or full-back. He was a key member of the 2010 UEFA European U17 Championship-winning side.

Liam Moore

Age 21, Centre-Back, Leicester City (loan spells at Bradford City and Brentford), U20 Caps 1, U20 Goals 0, U21 Caps 4, U21 Goals 0.

This has been a real breakthrough year for Moore as the commanding centre-back established himself in the Championship-winning Leicester side, making 30 appearances. Looks every bit a future full international.

Michael Keane

Age 21, Centre-Back, Manchester United (loan spells at Leicester City, Derby County, Blackburn Rovers), U20 Caps 0, U20 Goals 0, U21 Caps 3, U21 Goals 3.

Switched allegiance from the Republic of Ireland to England and the Manchester United product impressed on loan at Blackburn this season before Ryan Giggs placed him on the bench against Hull City in the last game of the season.

Measured: Michael Keane has impressed both at centre-half and right-back in recent seasons

Luke Garbutt

Age 21, Left-Back, Everton (loan spells at Cheltenham Town, Colchester United), U20 Caps 3, U20 Goals 0, U21 Caps 1, U21 Goals 0.

Part of the 2010 UEFA European U17 Championship winning side, the Everton left-back has only made two first team appearances for the club, with Leighton Baines keeping him out of the side.

James Ward-Prowse (c)

Age 19, Defensive Midfielder, Southampton, U20 Caps 5, U20 Goals 0, U21 Caps 7, U21 Goals 2.

Yet another player to come from Southampton’s conveyor belt of youth talent, Ward-Prowse has already made 49 first team appearances and is a key member of the Saints’ side, as well as being Gareth Southgate’s trusted skipper.

Captain Fantastic: Southampton midfielder James Ward-Prowse is expected to skipper the side

Nathaniel Chalobah

Age 19, Defensive Midfielder, Chelsea (loan spells at Watford, Nottingham Forest, Middlesbrough), U20 Caps 0, U20 Goals 0, U21 Caps 18, U21 Goals 1.

An extremely versatile and hard-working midfielder, Chalobah has lots of energy and uses his size and athleticism to dominate midfield. A player very much in the Yaya Toure mould.

Nathan Redmond

Age 20, Winger, Norwich City (previously at Birmingham City), U20 Caps 0, U20 Goals 0, U21 Caps 10, U21 Goals 5.

Redmond seems to have been around for an age. He is lightning quick and extremely dangerous on the counter. Could be crucial to England’s success on Monday night.

Josh McEachran

Age 21, Attacking Midfielder, Chelsea (loan spells at Swansea City, Middlesbrough, Watford, Wigan Athletic), U20 Caps 1, U20 Goals 0, U21 Caps 13, U21 Goals 1.

He really has not lived up to the early hype at Chelsea, yet McEachran dictates the tempo of England’s play with his short, sharp passing.

Tricky: Winger Nathan Redmond really impressed for Norwich City in the Premier League last season

Jordan Obita

Age 20, Winger, Reading (loan spells at Barnet, Gillingham, Portsmouth, Oldham Athletic), U20 Caps 1, U20 Goals 1, U21 Caps 0, U21 Goals 0.

Scored a debut goal in the 3-0 win over Qatar to continue a fantastic year for the youngster after he was named Reading’s player of the season. Can operate at left-wing or left-back and is supposedly interesting Arsene Wenger.

Saido Berahino

Age 20, Striker, West Bromwich Albion (loan spells at Northampton Town, Brentford, Peterborough United), U20 Caps 5, U20 Goals 0, U21 Caps 5, U21 Goals 6.

The West Brom forward scored the winner at Old Trafford earlier in the season and, although not prolific, he is a good finisher and he will be tasked with scoring England’s goals on Monday night.

Brazil (probable, 4-5-1)

Marcos

Age 18, Goalkeeper, U17 Caps 5, U23 Caps 1, Fluminense (played in Toulon tournament twice)

The Fluminese goalkeeper has yet to make a first-team appearance for his club side but is highly-rated within the Brazilian national set-up.

Gilberto

Age 21, Right-Back, U20 Caps 2, Internacional (on loan from Botafogo)

A tough-tackling right back who has enjoyed spells at Internacional and Botafogo. Will have to deal with the raw pace of Obita and Redmond on England’s flanks.

Driving forward: Twenty-one-year-old Gilberto is strong in the tackle and helps Brazil in attack

Marquinhos

Age 20, Centre-Back, U20 Caps 14, Brazil Caps 1, Paris Saint-Germain

Already has a full international cap and is one of the hottest prospects in Europe – which is exactly why Paris Saint-Germain forked out a staggering £25.4m to sign him from Roma last summer, and why Barcelona are trying to prize him away from the French capital.

Doria (c)

Age 19, Centre-Back, U20 Caps 8, Brazil Caps 1, Botafogo

Brazil’s captain forms a commanding centre-back partnership with Marquinhos. Has been linked with Chelsea in the past and is considered to be the next Thiago Silva.

Wendell

Age 20, Left-Back, U20 Caps 2, Bayer Leverkusen

Yet another Brazilian import into Europe, the left-back signed a five-year contract at Bayer Leverkusen in February. Has bags of energy and loves to get forward whenever he can.

Rodrigo Caio

Age 20, Defensive Midfielder, U20 Caps 2, Sao Paulo

Normally a centre-back, Caio operates at defensive midfield for the national side. Has won plaudits for his discipline and his man-marking abilities.

Hot property: Lucas Evangelista has had trials at Manchester United and a tricky customer in midfield

Lucas Evangelista

Age 19, Midfielder, U20 Caps 3, Sao Paulo

An attacking midfielder who had trials at Manchester United before opting to stay in his native Brazil, he is quick and extremely skilful on the ball. Will punish England if they give him time and space.

Leandro

Age 21, Winger, U20 Caps 3, U23 Caps 1, Brazil Caps 1, Palmeiras

Leandro is used to leading from the front at Palmeiras, but has slotted into the midfield for Brazil in Toulon so far. The attacking winger even scored when Luiz Scolari handed him his full international debut in a friendly against Bolivia.

Lucas Piazon

Age 20, Winger, U15 Caps 7, U17 Caps 15, U20 Caps 2, Chelsea

The attacking midfielder spent last season on loan at Vitesse Arnhem from Chelsea, having made just one league appearance under Roberto Di Matteo in the 8-0 win over Aston Villa. The 20-year-old can play in various attacking roles, and is likely to sit behind Thalles.

Familiar: Lucas Piazon - who was on loan at Vitesse in Holland - will be nothing new to Chelsea fans

Alisson

Age 20, Attacking Midfielder, U21 Caps 5, U20 Caps 3, U17 Caps 3, Cruzeiro (not to be confused with Alison)

Alisson has the ability to create something from nothing, and Cruzeiro’s attacking midfielder should line up as partner to Piazon. The 20-year-old spent time on loan at Vasco da Gama in 2013 so knows striker Thalles well. Not to be confused with Brazil’s defensive midfielder Alison.

Thalles

Age 19, Striker, U20 Caps 2, Vasco da Gama

Thalles can physically impose himself on his opponents, and is unlike the usual slick forwards Brazil are known for. He scored the first in the win over South Korea and should lead from the front again.
