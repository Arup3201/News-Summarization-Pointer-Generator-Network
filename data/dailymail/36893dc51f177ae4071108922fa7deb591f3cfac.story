Facebook Data Science examined Facebook accounts of people in relationships from around the world in a bid to understand relationship trends.

They found that internationally the average age gap between heterosexual partners is 2.4 years.

Facebook Data Science collected information from Facebook accounts around the world to get a sense of the average age gaps in relationships

Facebook figures: The age gap between partners in female-male, female-female and male-male relationships

The age difference between partners is significantly higher in same-sex relationships and highest among homosexual male couples, where the average age difference peaked at more than nine years.

In 67 per cent of heterosexual relationships the man is older than the woman, in 20 per cent of relationships the woman is older than the man, and in the remaining 13 per cent the couple is the same age (when the person’s age is rounded to the nearest year).

And it seems the older we get, the bigger the age gap. Older people were more likely to have a partner whose age differed significantly from their own than younger couples.

Age gaps between couples was lowest in Australia, where the average difference was 1.82 years. And the age gap was highest in Egypt where the average age difference was 5.09 years.

Most heterosexual couples in the world have a 2.4 year age gap, with the man as the older partner. The study found that on average, couples in same-sex relationships have a much larger age gap

Facebook Data Science also compared the age difference among heterosexual couples to the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) Global Gender Gap, which ranks countries based on the gender gaps in economics, politics, education and health.

On average the countries that had lower scores on the WEF’s index (those with large gender gaps on social and political issues) also have large age gaps in relationships

However, some Asian countries that scored poorly on the Global Gender Gap rating scheme also had smaller age differences in relationships.

Couples in the nations of South Korea and Japan for example, which rank fairly low on the Global Gender Gap index, have the same approximate age gap as couples in the gender progressive Scandinavian states of Sweden, Norway and Finland, and much smaller age differences than couples in the more equitable nations of Colombia and Ecuador.

Facebook Data Science attribute this to the fact these Asian nations are quite affluent and have high educational expectations, so couples are more likely to meet at university, where most people are of similar ages.

The researchers examined couples whose average age was between 20 and 49. The data was collected in October 2013 and released last month as part of Facebook Data Science's Valentine’s Day Love Series.

The older we get the bigger the age gap: Young people are more likely to pair up with people closer to their age than older people are
