It was a moment of madness that nearly claimed this womanâ€™s life.

Oblivious to the danger, she can be seen hopping and skipping on a Spanish beach as ferocious waves whipped up by gale-force storms lash the shoreline.

Her two friends showed a little more sense and beat a hasty retreat as the tide swept in.

But it was not until the last moment that the woman in the black swimsuit realised her danger and made a sprint for the concrete ramp which would lead her to safety.
