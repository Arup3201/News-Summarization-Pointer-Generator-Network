Steve Elkington, a professional golfer, has come under fire for remarks he made on Twitter about openly gay fellow sportsman Michael Sam.

The comments from the Australian PGA winner come just two weeks after the college star came out. 

On his personal account Elkington, 51, tweeted 'ESPN covering Michael Sam as a a gay athlete is embarrassing ... ' 

Championship golf player Steve Elkington has made comments about fellow sportsman Michael Sam on his Twitter account

And then he posted, 'I'm for Sam I'm against ESPN telling me he's gay ...' 

The PGA chamionship winner then continued, 'ESPN reporting Michael Sam is leading the handbag throw at NFL combine No one else expected to throw today.' 

However the tweets posted yesterday were later removed. 

It is not the first time that the Australian golfer has made inappropriate comments on the social media site. 

Last year, he wrote words of a racial nature on Twitter during the Senior British Open.and quarrelled with golfer Ian Poulter.

His comments came after Washington lobbyist Jack Burkman said he would be drafting a bill that would ban gay players from joining the National Football League.

Mr Burkman said he came up with the idea after Sam publicly came out a few weeks ago.

In a statement, he said: 'We are losing our decency as a nation. Imagine your son being forced to shower with a gay man.

'That's a horrifying prospect for every mom in the country. What in the world has this nation come to?'

Burkman, the founder and president of 
JM Burkman & Associates, said he has political support for the 
legislation, but his statement did not name specific lawmakers.

Urging Congress to act, he added: 'If the NFL has no morals and no values, then Congress must find values for it.'

 Burkman & Associates, which signed 70 new clients last year, 
specialises in helping companies secure contracts with the federal 
government, it was reported by The Hill.

On Saturday, 
Sam, the NFL's first openly gay draft prospect, appeared publicly at the
 league's scouting combine -- and during a press conference said he 
would be excited if drafted by the Miami Dolphins which has recently 
been subject to a bullying scandal.

Wearing a rainbow with the words 'Stand with Sam' on a pin given to him by a fan, he said: 'If the Miami Dolphins drafted me I 
will be excited to be a part of that organization, but I'm not thinking 
about going into that environment.'

'I know how to handle 
myself. I know how to communicate with my teammates,' he continued. 'I know how to 
communicate with the coaches and know the staff, whoever I need to 
communicate with.'

'If someone wants to call me a name, I will have a conversation with that guy and hopefully it won't lead to nothing else,' Sam said

Sam also said he was surprised by the support he received from staff and students at the University of Missouri, who he says have come up to him on campus to hug him

He also said that he would confront other players 
if they had issues with his sexual orientation.

'If
 someone wants to call me a name, I will have a conversation with that 
guy and hopefully it won't lead to nothing else,' Sam said.

Sam also was open about the media's interest in his sexuality.

'Heck yeah, I wish you guys would 
tell me, "Michael Sam, how's football going, how's training going?"' 'I 
would love for you to ask me that question, but it is what it is.'

'And I just wish you guys would see me as Michael Sam, the football player, instead of Michael Sam, the gay football player.'

Sam said he was 'kind of surprised' the support he received at the University of Missouri since coming out. He described being hugged and kissed by faculty and students on campus.

'A lot of people want this. There's just a lot of support out there,' he said.

When asked if he felt like a trailblazer, Sam said 'I feel like I'm Michael Sam.'

Though there has been some doubt over what position Michael Sam would be drafted for, he explained that he is simply a pass rusher. He listed ex-NFL player Michael Strahan as an example of a good pass rusher but that he wanted to make a name for himself.

If drafted, Michael Sam will be the first openly gay football player in the NFL

Sam recently also sent his father a text with two words: 'I'm gay.'

Michael Sam Sr said he had no idea of his son's sexuality but that he fully supports the University of Missouri star's decision to come out.

The dad even made light about the revelation, initially, according to NBC news, saying: 'Well, you could have wished me a happy birthday first.'

The 55-year-old, a disabled truck driver who lives in a nursing home in Texas, said his son called him later in the evening to talk about it.

'I was shocked because I didn't see it,' the father told NBC.

'I mean, you see your kids, but you don't suspect that.

'I said was he sure, and he said he was.

'He's in control and he's grown. No matter what, he's my son and I still love him.'

The proud father said he has no doubt his boy is capable of weathering any criticism he might face, adding that from an early eage Michael 'wanted to make something of himself'.

Sam Sr has joined a chorus of support for the brave decision made by the defensive linesman, who could become the first openly homosexual NFL player if he is selected for the league later this year.

Michelle Obama, along with some of the biggest names in the NFL, have also sent congratulatory messages.

'You're an inspiration to all of us,' the first lady wrote to Sam on Twitter. 

'We couldn't be prouder of your courage both on and off the field.'

'Thank you for your kind words,' he responded. 'Humbled by your support.'
