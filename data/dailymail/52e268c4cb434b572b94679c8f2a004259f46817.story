A six-year-old girl has been left with third-degree burns across 70 per cent of her head after a stranger lit her hair on fire while she played in the backyard.

Jayden Beddo, from Topeka, Kansas, is in stable condition at the University of Kansas Medical Center, where she will likely stay for at least two more weeks.

'There's going to be permanent scarring on the top of her head,' her uncle George Hearne told the Topeka Capital Journal. 'They're not sure if her hair is going to grow back.' 

Authorities are now searching for the man responsible for the cruel attack on Wednesday afternoon.

Attack:  Jayden Beddo had her hair lit by a stranger as she played in her uncle's backyard on Wednesday afternoon. She suffered third-degree burns to her head and second-degree burns to her hands

Jayden was playing with her five-year-old brother Christopher in the backyard of her uncle's home when Hearne heard the little boy running inside and screaming that his sister's hair was on fire.

Hearne ran outside and immediately put out the flames before calling 911.

'The only thing I saw when I ran out the back door was my niece's head engulfed in flames,' he said. 

The children said that a stranger cut through an alley beside the home and called to Jayden over the fence. He then lit a cigarette and then lit her hair, KSNT reported.

The little girl was rushed to Stormount Vail Hospital in Topeka but was then taken to the pediatric intensive care unit at the University of Kansas Hospital.

Doctors said she suffered third-degree burns to her head and second-degree burns to her hands.

Victim: Jayden, pictured before the attack, was in the garden with her brother when a stranger called her to the fence, lit a cigarette and then lit her hair, according to reports. Her uncle put out the flames

Fighter: Doctors said they are not yet sure if the girl will need surgery or whether her hair will grow back

Dhaval Bhavsar, the plastic surgeon treating Jayden, said the medical team will have a better idea of what treatment Jayden will need in a few days.

'I do expect there will be some scarring,' he told the Capital Journal. 'She will have some areas of baldness and I expect she will need some reconstructive surgery.'

Jayden's big sister, Caitlyn Beddo, said she was stunned when her mother told her what had happened.

'That was something I never expected to hear from my mom's mouth let alone even happen to my sister,' she told KSNT. 'It's heartbreaking.'

Police are now hunting for the man who attacked the little girl.

Shock: Her older sister Caitlyn said they hope to find out who attacked Jayden and put him behind bars

They found a lighter and the children said he was a middle-aged white man wearing a green shirt, green shorts and a red and blue hat.

'Hopefully this guy can be caught because to me it's a sick individual and he needs to be put behind bars something needs to be done,' Caitlyn said.

The family has also set up a gofundme page to collect $2,000 towards her medical care.
