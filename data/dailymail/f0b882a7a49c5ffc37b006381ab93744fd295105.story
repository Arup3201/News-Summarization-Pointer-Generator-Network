Opinion has swung to the Left since the last election – but Ed Miliband lacks the credentials to take advantage of it, a major report revealed yesterday.

Five years of austerity have pushed the mood further from the Right on issues such as public spending, Europe, welfare and business, it showed.

Political attitudes have now returned to the same point as 2005 when Tony Blair secured the last of his three election wins for Labour.

But the party still 'struggles to attract support' despite the shift in the public mood, according to detailed analysis of the latest British Social Attitudes Survey.

The report shows Labour's problems may be the result of a poor reputation for economic competence and leadership and the Conservative Party's ability to portray itself as moderate

It shows that Labour's problems may be the result of a poor reputation for economic competence and leadership and the Conservative Party's ability to portray itself as moderate, said the report. The shift to the Left could also help explain the rise of the Greens and SNP in Scotland, it added.

Veteran pollster Peter Kellner said: 'Ed Miliband loses more from a perception that he is not up to the job than he gains from being seen as closer to the centre ground.'

The report's author, Dr John Bartle, said the change in attitudes presented a potential danger for the Conservatives if it campaigns hard on issues like benefits and spending cuts.

He said: 'The general leftward shift that has taken place since the last general election suggests that arguments about the need to shrink the state, reduce waste and cut income taxes will have less traction than in 2010.'

The study, carried out by NatCen Social Research and the University of Essex, is based on an analysis of hundreds of opinion polls on a range of issues since 2010.

They feed into a wider study which has tracked political attitudes since the mid-1960s.

Dr Bartle said the trend since 2010 was typical of that seen in the past – with public opinion moving in the opposite direction to the government of the day. 

He said: 'Beginning in 1964, the average left-right position generally tracked rightwards until 1980, the year after Margaret Thatcher came to power.

'The public then gradually moved left during the 1980s and remained there for the duration of the [John] Major premiership.

'The mood shifted rightwards from 1997 under New Labour and then left under the Coalition. 

Consequently, governing parties that achieve their party's preferred policies cut the electoral ground from beneath their own feet – a Conservative government that reduces spending and taxes reduces concerns about waste and regulation, while a Labour government that increases resources to the NHS and education reduces concerns about public services.' 

SIX weeks ago Labour vowed not to carry out a negative election campaign. Yesterday it unveiled its first poster accusing the Tories of stripping the NHS to the bone. A Tory spokesman described it as ‘fear and smear’ tactics
