World Cup winning midfielder Sami Khedira was given a hero’s welcome on a return to his boyhood club yesterday.

The 27-year-old’s success was celebrated by TV Oeffingen, the side Khedira represented as a youth player before he joined nearby Stuttgart in 1995.

The Real Madrid man pulled was also pictured pulling on a club shirt, which carried the slogan, 'Once an Oeffinger, always an Oeffinger,' as he met fans at Fellbach city hall before flying to the club’s stadium.

The club 
also honoured Khedira in another way. Their sports ground will be 
renamed as the 'Sami Khedira Stadium,' in recognition of his success on 
the world stage.

The
 German, still on holiday after the World Cup, has been linked strongly 
with a pre-season move away from Real Madrid.

The arrival of Germany 
team-mate Toni Kroos at the Santiago Bernabeu for £24million may hinder
 Khedira’s chances of regular first-team football next season.

Arsenal
 are the club most likely to pounce should he become available.

The
 Gunners have been looking to secure a deal for the midfielder’s 
services, despite concerns over wage demands, with Khedira reportedly 
earning in the region of £75,000 per week.

The
 likelihood of any transfer remains doubtful, however with Khedira seemingly keen on fighting for his place at Real Madrid.

He told the Stuttgart 
Zeitung 'I now have my holiday until the 5th August, when I will return 
for the first training session in Madrid.'
