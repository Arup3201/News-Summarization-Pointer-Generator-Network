A Utah teenager has died in hospital after being run over by a car while sunbathing in her driveway.

The 15-year-old girl, Marli Hamblin, was lying out in the sun at her home in Syracuse on Friday around noon.

She was listening to her iPod when a family member backed out of the garage in a Chevy truck and didn't see her.

The truck drove over Hamblin, leaving her with a critical head injury, according to KUTV.

'Our precious Marli is home with her heavenly father. Please continue prayers of comfort for this family during this time,' it was written on the Miracle for Marli page.

Local police described the scene of the accident as tragic.

'It's not an easy case for everybody involved--the officers, firemen, the paramedics,' Syracuse Police Officer Erin Behm told.

'You can imagine, it was tragic.'

She was just about to start at Syracuse High School and had recently made the cheer squad.

She also enjoued playing the piano.

A GoFundMe fundraising page initially set up to assist her parents with medicals has already received over $5,600.
