Russian President Vladimir Putin has demanded that the Dutch government apologise after one of his country's diplomats was arrested.

Russia claims Dmitry Borodin was badly beaten in front of his children by armed men in camouflage during an arrest on Saturday night.

Speaking at an economic summit in Indonesia, President Putin said: 'This is the most gross breach of the Vienna Convention.

Speaking at an economic summit in Indonesia, Russia's President Vladimir Putin has condemned the arrest of one of the country's diplomats at his flat in The Hague in the Netherlands

'We
are awaiting an explanation, an apology and also punishment of those 
responsible. Depending on how the Dutch side conducts itself, we will 
react.'

The foreign ministry in Moscow says Mr Borodin's flat in The Hague was stormed by officers wanting to arrest him over false claims of alleged domestic abuse.

They say he explained he was a diplomat, but the men took no notice. The ministry added: 'Our diplomat was put in handcuffs and taken to a police station where he was held almost all night.

'After that he was let go without any explanations or apologies.'

Dutch Police spokeswoman Ellen van Zijl confirmed an 'incident' had taken place, but she could not give details.

Relations between the two countries were already under pressure following legal action by the Netherlands over the arrest of 30 Greenpeace campaigners.

The activists, who sailed on a Dutch ship and include two Dutch nationals, were last week charged with piracy after trying to board a Russian oil rig.

Moscow alleges that Dmitry Borodin's flat at The Hague was stormed by armed men who beat him in front of his children before keeping him in jail overnight

News of the charges, which carry a maximum 15-year sentence, prompted worldwide protests which were attended by actor Jude Law and musician Damon Albarn in London.

Diplomatic immunity is a special status granted under the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, giving immunity to anyone serving an officially recognised diplomatic function in another country.

Depending on rank that can range from immunity for official actions, to immunity from all civil and criminal proceedings.

Diplomatic agents and their families are 'inviolable', meaning they are exempt from all criminal jurisdiction.

Without a waiver, a diplomatic agent, or dependent, may only be detained if they are likely to harm either themselves or the public.

Diplomats cannot waive their own immunity, that can only be done by the Head of Mission for that country.

Where police think there is sufficient evidence to charge an individual, but the Head of Mission does not agree to a waiver, the authorities can ask for the withdrawal of the individual and their family.
