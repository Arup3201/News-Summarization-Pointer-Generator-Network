The FBI said Kevin Mosele, 20, of Kihei, Hawaii, was charged on Tuesday with interfering with a flight crew and could receive 20 years in prison if convicted.

On the plane he became agitated, spitting water at the crew and saying he would kill them, then shouting that he was 'going to set off a bomb'.

Investigators said that flight attendants found two small wine bottles and two small whisky bottles in Mosele's seat area that didn't match any of the kinds sold on the plane.

Mosele is alleged to have got up from his seat and stalked around the galley, telling one flight attendant: 'I bet I can open the door.'

When the attendant didn't respond, Mosele went on: 'Is that a challenge? I think I'm gonna do it.'

When the plane's captain warned him aboput his behaviour, Mosele allegedly mocked him by saying: 'Ooo, El Capitan, can I pretend to be a stewardess?'

The FBI said he had to be restrained. 'I am going to f****** kill you,' he allegedly said to flight crew as they held him down.

Mosele was arrested when the plane landed on Monday for a stopover in Los Angeles. It's eventual destination had been Hawaii.

He allegedly apologised to FBI agents when interviewed, telling them, 'It's all my fault', and 'I'm mad at myself'.

He has been freed on 10,000 dollars' (Â£5,800) bail after he was ordered to return to court for an arraignment on August 4.
