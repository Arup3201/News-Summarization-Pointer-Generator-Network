A century ago it was the pioneering 'poverty' map which charted starvation and deprivation across London and the squalor of Victorian Britain.

Now a modern-day version of social researcher Charles Booth's influential health map has painted a similar picture of sickness and disease, but with very different 21st Century causes.

While many of the poor in London 100 years ago were suffering from starvation, the same areas in the capital today are rife with deadly Type 2 diabetes, caused not by malnutrition but by an excess of junk food.

Startling similarities: The areas of London at high risk of diabetes in the present day map of London, left, are virtually the same as those which are most deprived in Charles Booth's social map of 1889, right

Mr Booth, a renowned Victorian social researcher, created his famous 'poverty maps' in the 1880s as an early form of 'social cartography' where different colours on the streets indicated the income and class of inhabitants.

Booth highlights several areas of East London which are coloured black and blue, meaning London's poorest inhabitants had a 'chronic want' and were 'vicious' or 'semi-criminal'.

The 21st century take on Booth's data highlights how disease and poverty are rife in exactly the same geographical areas.

Poverty-stricken: Victorian families like this one in the late 19th century had to endure low life expectancy rates caused by squalor, disease and starvation

Hard times: While many suffered ill-health due to starvation in Victorian Britain (like these children in 1860) modern youngsters are at risk of developing diabetes through addiction to junk food

Philanthropist
 Charles Booth's pioneering social research was ahead of its time in 
Victorian Britain and eventually helped influence government action 
against poverty.

A 
campaigner who became disillusioned with politics in the 1870s, Booth 
conducted surveys analysing the numbers of people in school and 
employment.

His initial research was a precursor to his key work, 'The survey into 
London life and labour'.

After
 criticising existing published work on poverty, Booth worked on the 
survey which would later become one of the most important documents in 
founding British sociology.

As
 part of his research for the survey into London life and labour, Booth 
spent several weeks lodging with working class London families.

His first map produced in 1889 documented street by street levels of poverty and wealth using coloured sections.

The
 importance of his social statistics work was recognised straight away, 
as Booth was awarded the first Guy Medal in Gold in 1882 by the Royal 
Statistical Society.

Dr Douglas Noble's modern interpretation, published in the British Medical Journal, highlights how the same areas as in Booth's Victorian map are now in the highest bracket for risk of diabetes.

Although there appears to be a correlation between Victorian Britain and modern-day London, the newly-researched maps do not account for various other factors which made for difficult living conditions 100 years ago.

At the turn of the century, widespread lack of sanitation and poor diets meant pitifully low life expectancy rates.

According to House of Commons research, the life expectancy in 1901 was just 45 for men and 48 for women.

Today, thanks to huge advances in medicine and greatly improved living conditions, men can expect to live to around 77 and women into their 80s.

Infant mortality has also plummeted since the end of the 19th century, when 140 infants died per 1000 in 1900 compared to less than 10 by the millennium.

The areas of Victorian London where the 'lowest class or very poor' lived are now inhabited by those with a 13.8 to 17.3 per cent chance of diabetes.

Public health expert Dr Noble, from Queen Mary, University of London, said: 'It was no surprise to see that diabetes risk is high in areas where poverty was high.

'What was surprising was that some of these pockets of deprivation and ill-health have persisted for more than 100 years.

'But
 unlike in Booth's time, we now know how diseases like diabetes can be 
prevented. Using electronic records to create maps like these throughout
 the country could improve health and save money for the NHS.'

Dr Noble's team chose to study type 2
 diabetes risk because it has well-known risk factors and is 
preventable.

It is strongly associated with poverty and South Asian 
ethnicity, both of which are common in east London today.

Although the study examined the London
 boroughs of Tower Hamlets, Hackney and Newham, the researchers say the 
same technique could be applied anywhere in the country, and to other 
diseases.

Unlike the Booth 
maps, which were based on observation, the new study uses an entire set 
of electronic records from GP surgeries in the area.

This very precise 
information means the maps are much more accurate and will be useful to 
individual GP surgeries.

Electronic
 records from more than half a million people were included in the research. 
Each was assessed for risk of developing diabetes using a 
well-established prediction tool, known as the QDScore.

People
 were categorised as 'high-risk' if they were found to have a one in 
five or greater risk of developing diabetes within ten years.

Overall,
 about 10 per cent of the adult population fell into the high-risk 
category. But the maps showed 'hotspots' where up to 17 per cent were at
 high risk.

Further analysis showed these hotspots were associated with 
areas of poverty.

And these hotspots were surprisingly similar to areas of poverty highlighted in Booth's maps from more than a hundred years ago.

Dr
 Noble said: 'When you think of what life was like in the East End in 
the late 1800s it's extraordinary what the NHS and public health 
professionals have achieved, often with limited resources.

'But there's more still to do, and we hope this detailed information will help to reduce risk of diseases like diabetes.'
