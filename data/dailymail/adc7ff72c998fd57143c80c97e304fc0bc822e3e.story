Carles Puyol is used to being the rock at the heart of the Barcelona defence but now it seems he is showing his strength in a different way - by using his girlfriend as an impromptu set of weights.

The 36-year-old retired at the end of last season following a glorious 15-year career with Barcelona, winning 21 trophies as well as captaining the Catalan giants for 10 years.

But now the former Spain defender has been keeping himself in shape by giving his girlfriend Vanessa Lorenzo a bit of a lift.

Puyol may have packed the game in after a series of knee problems forced him into retirement, but that hasn't stopped him keeping in shape.

And while his former Barcelona team-mates, including his mooted replacement Jeremy Mathieu, are in England training at St George's Park, he was pictured lifting up his girlfriend up in the air - proving he hasn't lost any of his famed strength.

And maybe Puyol has been inspired to take up a career in weightlifing (although he almost certainly wouldn't be able to use his girlfriend as equipment!)
