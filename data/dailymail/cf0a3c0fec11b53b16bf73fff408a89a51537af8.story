Roger Federer has pulled out of Sunday night's final of the ATP World Finals at the 02 Arena against Novak Djokovic.

The world No 2, who in the past has had back problems, is said to have felt very stiff following Saturday night's epic semi-final against compatriot Stan Wawrinka, which took two hours and 48 minutes to complete.

Federer showed class in coming out onto the court to apologise in person to the crowd for his absence, although he was not specific about  the exact cause of his problem. 

'I tried everything, rest, massage but I am not match fit,' he said. 'At this level I could not compete. It would be too risky to do it at my age now. Thank you for your support, it really keeps me going, and congratulations to Novak.'

The crowd took the bad news relatively well and organisers said ticket holders would be contacted.

To ensure a night of entertainment, British No 1 Andy Murray agreed to take on Djokovic in an exhibition match followed by a doubles match between Murray and John McEnroe against Tim Henman and Pat Cash.

Federer did not finish his media duties until 1am after his win over Wawrinka and is said not to have left his central London hotel until 3.30pm on Sunday afternoon ahead of what was scheduled to be a 6pm final. 

The ATP, promoters of the year-end finale that has daily crowds in excess of 17,500, looked set to confirm that Federer was pulling out amid reports from good sources that a singles exhibition match and doubles exhibition might replace what was meant to be his showdown against Djokovic.

Aside from the blow to fans, the news is worrying for Switzerland's Davis Cup team, who are due to play against France in the final over next weekend.

Federer was forced to play the evening match on Saturday as this event splits the two semi finals.

The problems experienced by Federer are likely to put more focus on whether it is right for one finalist to play so much later than the other the day before. 

Djokovic had finished his match by 3.30pm on Saturday while Federer was not done until 11pm because the event runs two separate sessions.

This is the third year that Djokovic has emerged as champion of the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals, although never in this fashion. 

The Serb world No 1 was presented with his winner's trophy in a low-key presentation before facing Murray. 

Murray received a standing ovation from the appreciative O2 crowd as he took to the court he left on Thursday night following a 6-0 6-1 thrashing from Federer.
