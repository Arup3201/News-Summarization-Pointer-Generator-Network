Neighbours are at their wits end about the disgraceful state of the front yard of a home piled high with rubbish, rotting food and rats scurrying throughout the property in western New South Wales.

A woman, believed to live in the Windred Street residence in Orange - three and half hours from Sydney - was seen casually sitting barefoot and cross-legged in the driveway among the filthy chaos.

The hoarder, who was sewing under a tree in her front garden, seemed completely oblivious to the negative attention she was drawing about her neglected and trashed dwelling.

The two cars parked on the front yard are barely visible as the vehicles are surrounded by tonnes of boxes and plastic bags full of even more junk

The entire yard is littered with newspapers, festering boxes, plastic bottles, egg cartons - while one crutch is leaning against trunk of the tree next to the woman.

A trailer is also parked in the driveway jammed packed and overflowing with gallons of rubbish.

The three rubbish bins provided by the council look as they were filled to the brim quite some time ago with rubbish also sitting on top of the closed lids.

Neighbours claim the hoarder brings back rubbish daily in her shopping trolley to add to the huge mess

Margaret Wilson, who bought a property next door to the filthy house in the early 1980s, said all residents on Windred Street are not only concerned about the potential devaluation of their properties but also of the health risk from the festering mess

'It's absolutely disgraceful. Everyday she goes down the street and brings more and more things home in a shopping trolley,' she told Central Western Daily.  

Despite the Orange City Council ordering several clean ups, Mrs Wilson said the owner proceeded to collect tonnes of rubbish in the front yard.

A council spokesman said residents were told the rubbish would be removed in early November but the council was still waiting to hear back from contractors with quotes.

'The regulatory process, which must be followed, is very detailed and doesn't allow swift action to be taken or the financial penalties involved to be felt by an individual directly responsible for the problem,' he told the Central West Daily.
