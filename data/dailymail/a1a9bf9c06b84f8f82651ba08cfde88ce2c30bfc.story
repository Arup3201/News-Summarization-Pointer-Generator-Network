Shocking: Phillip DeSelle confessed to murdering an 11-year-old girl who came to his Louisiana home to sell candy in 1990, but walked free after serving just half his sentence

Phillip DeSelle senselessly murdered an 11-year-old girl as she sold candy door-to-door in 1990. Despite having confessed and remained unrepentant, he walked out of prison a free man Friday.

DeSelle, who said he 'just snapped' and killed Averie Evans and stashed her corpse in a Natchitoches, Louisiana Dumpster, had only served half of his original 50-year sentence.

The now 65-year-old cold-blooded killer received that sentence prior to a change in Louisiana's so-called 'good time' laws, allowing him to cut his sentence fully in half with good behavior and his participation in self-improvement programs.

DeSelle was sentenced at age 41 back in 1991 after he told police he opened his door to find Averie, snatched her from the porch and killed her.

'At the time we thought he would be in his 80s or 90 when he got out. You get some sense of peace with that,' Averie's aunt Erin Keyser told USA Today. 

Louisiana lawmakers changed the good time law in 1997 in order to ensure that violent criminals serve at least 85 percent of their prison term, which offers little but cold comfort to Averie's family.  

Horrific: Averie Evans was selling candy for a school fundraiser when DeSelle murdered her and stached her body in a Dumpster. 

Served half his sentence: DeSelle benefited from a since-changed law allowing violent Louisiana criminals to shave off as much as half their sentences with good behavior and self-improvement programs

Keyser created a Facebook page in honor of Averie's memory soon after learning of DeSelle's early release.

A January 22 post read: 

'Another day has dawned and our Averie is still gone, and now her killer walks free. The cold, gray rain outside matches our grief.'

According to KLFY, DeSelle has chosen to live int he Bayou Chicot area in central Lousiana.

DeSelle's release is one of many slaps in the face that Averie's family has endured. Not only was her killer unrepentant about his crime, the little girl's body was never found.

'He's an evil man. He never showed any remorse or regret,' Keyser said. 

DeSelle told authorities he'd dumped her body in an area Dumpster, but searches came up empty.

Averie's body was never found even after DeSelle's confession, so prosecutors charged and got DeSelle convicted of just manslaughter and kidnapping

The case was reopened years later and authorities dug up the driveway of DeSelle's former home in search of Averie's remains, to no avail.

While her death did put a stop to children raising funds door-to-door for a time, even that effect of the heinous crime didn't last. 

Nonetheless, Keyser, with the help of her Facebook page Justice for Averie, continues her fight with the help of other outraged members of her community.

'Our only recourse is to warn people, Keyser told USA Today. 'The main thing is to protect the children, that no family will have to go through this devastation.'

He was convicted prior to the changing of co-called 'good time' laws that give credit for good behavior and allow sentences to be cut by 50 percent
