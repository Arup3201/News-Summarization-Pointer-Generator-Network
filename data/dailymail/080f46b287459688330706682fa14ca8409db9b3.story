Accused: Ben Blakeley is on trial for allegedly murdering his ex-girlfriend Jayden Parkinson

A former binman has told a court that he deserves the death penalty for killing his pregnant ex-girlfriend.

Ben Blakeley, 22, strangled 17-year-old Jayden Parkinson in countryside near Didcot, Oxfordshire, in December last year, shortly after she told him she was carrying his child.

Days
 later - with the help of a 17-year-old boy - Blakeley buried Ms 
Parkinson's body in the established grave of his uncle in the nearby All Saints’ churchyard.

Giving evidence at Oxford Crown Court, Blakeley told jurors: 'I deserve a death sentence for what I've done.'

He also said that he relives the night he killed Jayden over and over again in his head, describing it like a 'video'.

The jury heard that Blakeley was obsessive and controlling and after he and Jayden split.

He
 had threatened to post intimate naked videos and photographs of her on 
Facebook - hoping that she would kill herself as a result, they were 
told.

Jayden was last seen alive with 
Blakeley on the afternoon of December 3 last year in Didcot, 
Oxfordshire, having met up to discuss her pregnancy.

When
 she had broken the news to Blakeley 24 hours’ previously in a telephone
 call he became angry, denying he was the father, prosecutors allege.

On December 19 her body was recovered from the grave of Blakeley’s uncle, Alan Kennedy, at All Saints’ churchyard in Didcot.

In
 the graveyard, Blakeley and his co-accused, who cannot be identified 
for legal reasons, buried Jayden’s body in the grave of Mr Kennedy, who 
died in 2006.

Blakeley told the court he had dug two
 shallow graves for Jayden - one in the countryside close to where he 
killed her - and the second in the graveyard.

Under
 cross-examination from prosecutor Richard Latham QC, Blakeley said that
 when he buried her the first time - two days after he killed her - she 
was cold.

Mr Latham replied:
 'She was more than cold, the body would have been stiff... There came a
 time when you had to manhandle her into the hole the two of you had 
dug.'

Victim: Jayden Parkinson, 17, was last seen alive when she went to meet Blakeley to tell him she was pregnant. Blakeley buried Ms Parkinson's body in the established grave of his uncle in a nearby churchyard

'Was the hole you dug the length of a body?,' Mr Latham asked.

Blakeley replied: 'I can’t tell you the f****** size.'

Mr
 Latham said: “You were digging a hole the size and length of a grave...
 It was hard to dig, it was so hard to dig that you needed to enlist 
(the youth) to help. It was a big undertaking.'

'What did you tell him [the co-accused] the hole was for?'

The defendant replied: 'I said to him it was either for weapons or an animal... You are trying to get at that [the youth] knew.'

'He and Jayden were friends... I didn’t tell anybody... The very [first] person I told was my solicitor,' he said.

'[The youth] was trying to help the police. He didn’t know nothing,' Blakeley added.

Mr
 Latham said: 'You were digging something the size of a grave and you 
were doing it with (the youth) and to say you were doing it to bury 
weapons or an animal is nonsense.”

Blakeley
 replied: “If you are trying to say that [the youth] knew about it, he 
didn’t... I either told him it was for an animal or a weapon... That’s 
the fourth time I have said it and I am not saying it again.'

Mr Latham asked Blakeley how he was 
able to get Jayden, who was 5ft 6in tall, into a large suitcase less 
than 3ft in length and suggested he was going to do some 'dreadful 
things to her body' to get her into the suitcase.

'There was no nice way of doing what I was going to do... There was no way of doing things respectfully, Blakeley insisted.

Mr Latham said: 'You were capable of doing it... You had to ram her body into the suitcase.'

'When you got stuck on that track you rang for a taxi and you were as cool as a cucumber when that taxi driver turned up.'

Blakeley said: 'I had to act normal.'

Mr Latham said: “You are cold, calm and calculating when you want.”

Blakeley
 replied: “You said I was a cold, calculating killer... I think about 
that night every day. I think about it in my dreams. I hear them 
noises.'

'It’s like a video in my dreams... That means I’m not a f****** killer. Since I have been in prison I have met real killers.'

The defendant also insisted that when he cried giving evidence last week, they were not 'crocodile tears'.

'I am not the type of person to cry. I am not a f****** woman,' he said.

'I
 am responsible for all of this...That night is like a video in my head 
and I see it and it doesn’t fade away. I just remember more f****** 
detail,' he added.

Blakeley, of Christchurch Road, 
Reading, Berkshire, has denied murdering Jayden but has admitted her 
manslaughter and attempting to pervert the course of justice.

But the prosecution refused to accept his plea and he has now gone on trial alongside his 17-year-old co-defendant.

The
 youth has also pleaded guilty to attempting to pervert the course of 
justice but denies a charge of preventing a lawful burial.

A post-mortem examination found that Jayden died as a result of pressure to the neck.

There
 was also evidence of 'relatively widespread' areas of bruising to her 
face and scalp which was indicative of being caused by a fist or foot.

The teenage co-defendant in the Jayden Parkinson murder trial has said he was tricked into digging the 17-year-old's grave.

The youth, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told Oxford Crown Court that Ben Blakeley told him it was 'not relevant' when he asked why they were digging a hole above an established grave in the All Saints’ churchyard in Didcot.

Shortly after killing his pregnant ex-girlfriend, Blakeley enlisted the help of the 17-year-old co-defendant to help bury her body in the same grave as his late uncle, Alan Kennedy.

Mr Steen, defending, asked the youth: 'How did he react if you asked Ben Blakeley his business?'

The youth replied: 'He wouldn't tell me or say its not relevant.'

He also told jurors that Blakeley told him he needed his help to tidy up Mr Kennedy's grave in time for Christmas.

'He said it was evil to dig in a graveyard so we have to do it at night and I didn't know anything about that, so I went along with it,' the youth said.

'I thought we were digging about an inch and put down some new stones and the next day Ben was going to take me to Abingdon to get a headstone.'

The youth said he got one spade from a relative's house and Blakeley got one from a shed at a nearby allotment, along with some string and nails.

Mr Steen asked: 'Did it occur to you you were digging Jayden's grave?'

'No,' the youth replied.

Mr Steen asked: 'Would you have been prepared to dig a grave for Jayden?'

'No,' he replied again.

The youth then told jurors that Blakeley left him to carry on digging and said would be back in 30 minutes.  But he took several hours and the youth said he became 'annoyed' and tried ringing Blakeley to find out where he was.

Mr Steen asked: 'Did you have any idea that he was going to get a body?'

'No,' the teenager replied.

Mr Steen said: 'The prosecution say you knew precisely what he was doing, that he was going to pick up a body. Would you have been helping if you had any idea?'

'No,' the teenager replied for a final time.

The trial was adjourned until tomorrow.
