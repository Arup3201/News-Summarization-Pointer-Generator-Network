Temperatures were rising Sunday morning across the Northeast, causing heavy snowfall to turn into rain and making the roads slick with ice.

Another round of wintry weather battered the U.S. Midwest and East Coast on Saturday as a massive storm spanning more than 1,000 miles dumped heavy snow, snarling air traffic and making roads treacherous.

Parts of New England could see up to a foot by the time the front move out on Sunday and ushers in high winds that could be a hazard of their own. Up to 14 inches could fall in coastal towns in Maine.

Multiple accidents were reported on roadways throughout the Midwest and Northeast, while airports reported about 1,000 cancellations as some parts of the Northeast got a third round of snow in a week's time - and well before the official start of winter.

Stormy: Heavy snow is focusing on northern New England this Sunday, causing even more travel disruptions

Widespread: The snowstorm has already spanned more than 1,000 miles. Snow has reached every major city and rural area from St. Louis to Boston, including Chicago, Detroit, Indianapolis, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and New York City

Airlines reported weather-related 
delays and cancellations, with major airports in Chicago, Washington, 
New York City and Newark, New Jersey, scrubbing dozens of flights, 
according to the Federal Aviation Administration.

Nearly 1,000 U.S. flights were cancelled on Saturday, FlightAware.com said.

Power utilities appear to have handled the heavy, wet snow better than the airports.Â  As of early Sunday morning, less than 1,500 outages were reported throughout New York City, Long Island, northern New Jersey and parts of Connecticut.

Officials and road crews are still urging residents to stay home and off the roads whenever possible.

The fast-moving snowstorm stretched from Missouri to Maine, as steady rain fell in the southeastern states.

The heaviest accumulation was 
expected in central Pennsylvania, New York state and interior New 
England, which could see from 4 to 8 inches of snow. Mountainous areas 
and parts of eastern Maine could be walloped by 14 inches of snow.

Snow expected to change to 
freezing rain in parts of Massachusetts and Connecticut could accumulate
 to a quarter-inch (6.5 mm) of ice, according to the National Weather 
Service.

By 3 p.m. EST on Saturday, areas 
of north-central Illinois reported 7 inches of snow over the past 24 
hours, while the town of Warsaw, New York, near Lake Ontario, reported 
21 inches, the National Weather Service said.

Up to six inches of accumulation was expected in major cities on the East Coast, forecasters said.

The same region was slammed a week
 ago by another massive storm system that left parts of the Mid-Atlantic
 and East Coast shoveling out from a half-foot of snow.

Nasty weather: The storm could cause shipping delays and force Christmas shoppers to change their plans for the weekend

Good for winter sports: The recent cold weather, this storm, and others will translate to plenty of snow on the ski slopes

West mess: In the wake of the storm, areas made wet and slushy from melting during the day on Sunday will freeze on Sunday night, producing patches of black ice

Bright lights: Power utilities appear to have handled the heavy, wet snow better than the airports.  As of early Sunday morning, less than 1,500 outages were reported throughout New York City, Long Island, northern New Jersey

Utility companies across the region put extra crews on duty and made preparations for possible outages.

The driving snow was a sobering 
reality check for an expected 35,000 pub crawlers dressed like Santa 
Claus, who came to New York for the annual SantaCon. The revelers wore 
Santa suits or red minidresses with white trim and nearly all had Kris 
Kringle hats topped with a white pom-pom.

The precipitation and freezing 
temperatures made roads and highways treacherous for drivers. Michigan 
State Police said they had handled 20 crashes since midnight, including 
one fatal accident.

In Missouri, icy conditions were 
blamed for a fatal crash Saturday morning. An 80-year-old man died when 
his car skidded off a rural highway and struck a tree near Deepwater, in
 the western part of the state, the Missouri State Highway Patrol said.

The snowstorm comes on one of the 
busiest shopping weekends of the year and during one of the shortest 
holiday buying seasons, with only four weeks separating Thanksgiving and
 Christmas.

At a shopping mall north of 
Philadelphia, schoolteacher Amanda Nixon, 30, arrived early in the day 
with her 9-year-old daughter hoping to get errands done before the snow 
picked up.

'We like the snow," she said. "We just don't like to drive in it.'

Nixon said she thought other shoppers would put off holiday gift buying because of the second weekend of bad weather.

'I think a lot of people are nervous that this is going to be another big one,' she said.

The winter weather is expected to 
continue through the early part of next week, as snow and winds from 10 
to 20 miles per hour (16 to 32 kilometers per hour) are forecast for 
much of the East Coast, the weather service said.
