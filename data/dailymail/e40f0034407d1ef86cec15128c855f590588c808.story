The footage of a man desperately hanging onto the outside of a car door while the driver swerves in and out of traffic could be straight out of an upcoming action movie.

In fact, Chinese police are now hunting down the man who drove maniacally through the city of Zhenjiang - dragging along a former friend whom he owed money.

With Sun Peng desperately clinging on for his life, Ren Chiang reached speeds of 50mph and drove into oncoming traffic before his terrified passenger finally let go.

Dangerous: Ren Chiang drove recklessly through traffic and even sped into oncoming vehicles to try and knock off the man who he owed around £1,000

Life-threatening: He had panicked when Sun Peng spotted him at a car wash even though he had told his former friend he was broke and homeless

35-year-old Ren had borrowed around £1,000 from his former-friend Sun and panicked when he spotted the man he was indebted to at a car wash in eastern China, the People's Daily reported.

Ren had vanished after taking the money and when his friend asked for it back he pleaded poverty and claimed he was homeless.

After the life-threatening incident, Sun said: 'When I saw him driving around in a car and obviously having enough money to pay for a car wash, I realised I had been conned and went up to demand he pay me back the money he had borrowed.'

But Sun had did not expect such an explosive reaction from his former friend who had put his foot down and tried to speed off.

Sun added: 'I tried to grab hold of the car and found myself being dragged off down the road. 

'He really put his foot down and according to the police who looked at the CCTV images we were doing 80 kph [50mph] as he tried to shake me off.

'I was begging him to stop and telling him just to let me go but he carried on, I could feel the road wearing through my shoes and I had to move my weight onto my heels as it was thicker otherwise I would have torn off the soles of my feet.' 

Reckless: CCTV footage showed Ren reaching speeds of 50mph as his unwilling passenger desperately hung on to the outside of his door

Desperate: After the ordeal, Sun said: 'I was begging him to stop and telling him just to let me go but he carried on'

CCTV footage shows the driver speeding through red lights, zig-zagging through traffic and deliberately hitting other vehicles to try and shake Sun off.

Eventually the exhausted Sun let go of the car as it slows down - allowing Ren to make his escape.

A police spokesman confirmed: 'We would not get involved over the question of loaned money that has not been returned, as it's a civil matter, but dangerous driving and attempted murder are a different thing entirely.'
