Arsenal qualified for the knockout stages of the Champions League with a 2-0 win over Borussia Dortmund in Group D.

Sportsmail's Sami Mokbel rates the players' performances on Wednesday. 

ARSENAL 

Damien Martinez - 7

Made a vital save to deny Mkhitaryan in the first-half and grew in confidence from there.

Calum Chambers - 7

The right back could have been more economical in possession but proved effective in both halves.

Per Mertesacker - 6.5

Not been at his best this season but looked more like his old self.

Midfielder Santi Cazorla produced his best performance this season for Arsenal

Nacho Monreal - 6.5

Again asked to fill in centre back and kept to his task well enough. Wenger will be pleased Laurent Koscielny is fit again, though.

Kieran Gibbs - 6.5

Responded to his unlucky own goal against Manchester United on Saturday with a typically steady display.

Mikel Arteta -  6.5

The skipper was quiet but efficient in central midfield. Kept things moving nicely in midfield. Booked.

Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez lit up the Emirates with a wonderful second goal

Aaron Ramsey - 7

Still short of those blockbusting displays of last season, but a much improved performance.

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain - 7

The crossbar denied him a goal of the season contender on his 100th appearance for the club.

Alexis Sanchez - 7.5

Looked a little leg weary at times, but still lit up the Emirates Stadium with a great goal.

Striker Yaya Sanogo gave Arsenal the perfect start with a third-minute strike

Santi Cazorla - 8

His best performance for Arsenal this season. Set-up Sanogo's opener and caused the visitors big problems.

Yaya Sanogo - 7

A night the young Frenchman will never forget. Still very raw but his goal will do him the world of good.

Subs 

Flamini (on for Arteta 67 - 6.5) 

Podolski (on for Sanogo 79 - 6)

Campbell (on for Oxlade-Chamberlain 89)

Not used

Huddart, Koscielny, Bellerin, Rosicky

Arsenal's performance and victory eased the pressure on manager Arsene Wenger

Manager 

Arsene Wenger - 7

His team produced a gutsy performance when he most needed it. He'll hope it's the start of better times.

DORTMUND (4-2-3-1)

Weidenfeller - 6.5

Miserable night for the Dortmund keeper. Will be disappointed not to have saved Sanchez's effort 

Piszczek - 6.5

The right back was given a hard time by Sanchez and Cazorla. Not a night he'll want to remember 

Dortmund defender Lukasz Piszczek endured a rough night at the Emirates

Subotic - 7

The pick of Dortmund's defenders on a poor night for the Bundesliga outfit 

Ginter - 6.5

The movement of Sanchez, Cazorla and at times Sanogo cause him problems. Not the most commanding display

Schmelzer - 6.5

Had a good contest with Oxlade-Chamberlain, with the Arsenal man just shading it 

Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang 's pace was a constant threat to Arsenal

Gundogan - 6.5

A midfielder who has been on Arsenal's radar for a while. You can see why, but couldn't influence the result 

Bender - 6.5

Looked impressive in patches but couldn't get to grips with the speed of some of Arsenal's passing 

Grosskreutz - 6.5

Came off second best in his duel with Chambers. Didn't do much to threaten Arsenal's back-four 

Immobile - 5.5

Largely anonymous throughout. Arsenal's back-four had little trouble in dealing with his threat 

Henrikh Mkhitaryan (right) battles for the ball with Arsenal's Ramsey and Mathieu Flamini

Mkhitaryan - 6.5

Kept plugging away looking for openings in the attacking third, but Arsenal nullified his potency 

Aubameyang - 6

His pace had Arsenal worried in parts, but another who will be disappointed by his display 

Subs 

Kagawa (on for Immobile 60 - 6)

Ramos (on for Aubameyang 60 - 6)

Jojic (on for Grosskreutz 78 - 6)

Subs not used 

Langerak, Durm, Hornschuh, Kehl

Dortmund boss Jurgen Klopp is also feeling the pressure

Manager 

Jurgen Klopp - 6

Has big problems on his hands to revive his side's stuttering domestic form. This result won't have helped 

Man of the match

Cazorla

Attendance

59,902

Referee

Viktor Kassai - 7
