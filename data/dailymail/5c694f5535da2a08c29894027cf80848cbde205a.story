Organisers of the Sochi Winter Olympics have found themselves on a loo-sing streak after another set of toilets-for-two were discovered by reporters.

These bizarre side-by-side toilets in a single bathroom were found by reporters just outside a press centre at the Olympics park in the Russian city.

The Sochi organising committee initially denied any knowledge of the unusual twin conveniences, in a security screening point, and hasn't been able to say whether they were built on purpose or as a result of a plumbing error.

The toilet troubles have added an unexpected dimension to international perceptions of the sporting event, which Russian president Vladimir Putin had intended as a show of strength and prosperity on the international stage.

They are the second set of double toilets to raise eyebrows in the West, after a BBC correspondent in the city found himself 'seeing double' in a cubicle at the Olympic park's cross-country skiing and biathlon centre.

Moscow reporter Steve Rosenberg took the picture when he went to use the
 bathroom during a site visit last month.

He uploaded the image to Twitter alongside 
the words: 'Seeing double in the Gentlemen's Loo at the Olympic Biathlon
 Centre' and the picture instantly went viral.

The unusual cubicles haven't been the only baffling feature of Sochi toilet etiquette, however.

Today Canadian snowboard Sebastien Toutant uncovered a warning sign detailing a baffling array of lavatory offences - including a reminder not to go fishing in the toilet.

Signs also reminded visitors not to stand on the toilet seat, urinate while standing up, or vomit in the toilets

The games begin on February 7.
