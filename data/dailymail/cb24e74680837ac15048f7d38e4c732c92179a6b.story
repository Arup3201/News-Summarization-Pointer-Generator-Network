More than 250 foreign criminals including killers, paedophiles, rapists and a terrorist were allowed to stay in the country last year on human rights grounds without Government lawyers challenging their cases in court.

Their applications to stay were simply rubber stamped by a Home Office official.

The number of such cases has increased five-fold in the past three years. It has raised fears that some appeal cases are not being challenged in the courts when they should be.

Worrying: Killers and rapists were among 250 foreign criminals who should have been deported at the end of their prison sentences but were instead allowed to stay in Britain without their cases being considered by a court

However officials insisted it was pointless fighting appeals they were bound to lose.

They
said the real problem was immigration rules that allowed too many 
claims to succeed under Article 8 of the Human Rights Act, which 
guarantees the right to respect for private and family life

Action: Home Secretary Theresa May last year announced a crackdown on use of the 'right to a family life' defence to avoid deportation

A
freedom of information request revealed more than 600 human rights 
appeal cases were approved by the Home Office in the past four years.

The number has risen from 56 in 2008 to 80 in 2009, 217 in 2010 and 250 last year, it was reported yesterday.

On
top of the 250 cases that were not challenged, 409 offenders were 
allowed to stay last year after a judge approved their appeal against 
deportation.

Ministers have 
introduced tougher rules on the use of Article  8, which has been blamed
for allowing foreign criminals to stay in this country despite 
committing horrendous crimes.

They include Aso Mohammed Ibrahim, who left a girl of 12 to die under the wheels of his car.

A
UK Border Agency spokesman said it was pointless to challenge cases it 
expected to lose and had changed the rules to make it easier to reject 
human rights claims.

He added: ‘There is no point in wasting taxpayers’ money contesting cases where we were advised we would lose.

‘We examined each claim but case law based on the old rules meant the courts were highly likely to uphold them.

‘That’s why we changed the rules last month to help us remove criminals who try to use Article 8 to dodge deportation.

‘As
a result, we believe that  we will see fewer cases where  the 
Government is likely to  lose and therefore fewer uncontested hearings.’

Accusations: Chris Bryant, the Labour shadow immigration minister claimed the real problem is Theresa May's inability to get a grip of her department

One terrorist, up to eight 
killers and rapists, 20 robbers and eight paedophiles were given 
permission to stay

The Home Office accepted that deporting them would be a breach or their human rights
