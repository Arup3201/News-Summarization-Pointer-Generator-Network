Daley Blind is expected to leave Ajax - with Manchester United in the frame for the Holland full-back - after it emerged the 24-year-old has been training alone since he returned from international duty. 

Ajax youth coach Richard Witschge said: 'I think Daley Blind will be leaving soon. I have a feeling. 

'He has been training by himself. I think he has done that because there's something going on.'
