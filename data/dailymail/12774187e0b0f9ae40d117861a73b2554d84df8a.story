She came to Britain for a fresh start, a chance to put her chaotic Hollywood lifestyle behind her. It was, she insisted, time to 'grow up'. 

But Lindsay Lohan's hopes of starting anew could unravel as early as this week – and in spectacular fashion.

The actress faces allegations that she failed to complete 240 hours of court-ordered community service that she had vowed to carry out in London. 

And embroiled in the controversy is a prominent British charity, which has been accused of helping her inflate the number of hours she spent carrying out her punishment.

Lindsay Lohan faces allegations that she failed to complete 240 hours of court-ordered community service. British charity Community Service Volunteers (pictured) has been accused of helping her inflate numbers 

The claim raises the question of whether Community Service Volunteers (CSV) colluded with the actress in exchange for publicity – an allegation the charity denies.

Miss Lohan arrived in London last autumn to star in a West End production of David Mamet's play, Speed The Plow. 

It would, she hoped, prove her credentials as a serious actress. But at the time she had still not completed the community service she received for reckless driving after her Porsche collided with a truck in 2012.

An American judge agreed to allow Miss Lohan to complete the hours in London with the help of CSV, whose chairman is Labour peer Lord Levy.

Now, according to official documents filed in the US courts, the charity says she has not only completed the 240 hours, but exceeded them in the short time between October and January.

But The Mail on Sunday has seen documents and spoken to well-informed sources which suggest she has done no such thing, raising questions about what activities have been logged as 'community service'.

A source close to the Speed The Plow production told this newspaper that Miss Lohan's plans to fit her punishment around the play's demanding schedule had 'always been a concern' for producers.

'The people behind the play wanted to know if she would be able to do both,' the source said.

'Lindsay's people insisted that they would be able to work it into her schedule, but it was clear that it would not have been possible.'

That question appeared to be a key topic at her initial meeting with CSV on October 6 last year. According to another source, the subject of inflating Miss Lohan's hours was openly discussed. 'They knew they couldn't do it,' said the source.

'The question was asked if the hours could be padded. You know, could they say she did 90 per cent of it? CSV said they would see what they could do – wink, wink – and mentioned fundraising and publicity.'

The source added that Miss Lohan was then quick to post a photograph of herself with CSV's Is Szoneberg, director of volunteering operations, and Laura Doughty, director of external affairs and fundraising, on her Instagram account, which has almost 3 million followers.

Under the picture she wrote: 'Another great meeting with @CSV_UK making a difference every single day.' She accentuated the message with symbols of a heart and hands in a prayer position.

'It was all, 'what can we do for her and what can she do for us',' said the source.

In other documents seen by this newspaper, CSV agreed to sign off hours for Miss Lohan 'retroactively' and also agreed that the initial meeting between the actress, her team and CSV could count towards her total. It was also asked whether Miss Lohan's appearance at last year's Women of the Year Awards in London could count towards her punishment. CSV suggested that it could.

The charity advised Miss Lohan's team that this would not be linked to CSV. But according to the official log, four hours were assigned by CSV on the day of the awards. The log also says Miss Lohan spent 56 hours working with or on behalf of CSV's charitable community project, the Red Route Cafe in Hackney.

American officials have their doubts. Terry White, lead prosecutor in Miss Lohan's US case, last month challenged both the type of work Miss Lohan claimed to have done – and even if she had done it at all.

The star's official volunteering log submitted to the court states that she carried out administrative and planning work with the charity, agreed to 'meet and greet' young volunteers after performances of Speed The Plow, and allow other young volunteers to shadow her.

Her 'work shadowing' role was 'most questionable', Mr White said, telling a court: 'Work shadowing basically is hanging out with her. I'd love to hang out with a celebrity. That's not community service.'

But he also took issue with the timeline of hours on Miss Lohan's log. He questioned, for example, just how the star was able to complete 30 hours for CSV from January 19 to 21 while also being treated for a virus picked up in Bora Bora.

'[A] note says she received acute care for three days, but on those three days, again, ten hours [per day] were served,' Mr White told the court, adding: 'I'm having trouble not only with the quality of the work but whether or not the work was actually done.'

Last week it was reported that Miss Lohan successfully lobbied US car insurance firm Esurance to donate $10,000 (£6,500) to CSV.

CSV is well respected, so how did it come to be embroiled in this way? Was the organisation star-struck by the actress, hungry for the publicity Miss Lohan could bring with her 8.8 million Twitter followers?

'This girl has manipulated a British organisation,' the source said. 'They were hoodwinked into letting her get away with it. People are in awe of Lindsay. But this is celebrity manipulation and it's not fair. She did the crime in LA so should have done the punishment there.

'It's one rule for ordinary citizens and another for celebrities. She didn't do those hours. It makes a mockery of the legal system. This is someone who has had so many chances. But now I wonder if this community service hearing is going to be the crunch? Will she now go to jail?'

Mr White told The Mail on Sunday that a prison sentence would not be ruled out for Miss Lohan if she is found in breach of her probation terms on Wednesday.

Despite her wild child reputation, she is understood to have conducted her working life with some degree of professionalism. Although Speed The Plow is thought to have lost £200,000, cast and crew were impressed by her performances.

Miss Lohan's spokesman would not comment on the allegations last night. CSV chief executive Oonagh Aitken said: 'I am not aware of anything which would support such an allegation. We take our responsibilities in relation to all kinds of volunteering with great seriousness.'
