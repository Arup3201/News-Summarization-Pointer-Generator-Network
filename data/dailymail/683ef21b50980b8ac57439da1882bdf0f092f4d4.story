When Bruce Springsteen played the first ever gig at the £60million Leeds Arena last night, it was supposed to be a landmark event for the cultural life of Britain's third-largest city.

But one jobsworth council employee was determined to deflate the celebratory atmosphere - by slapping parking tickets on The Boss's tour trucks outside the venue.

City officials - who have keenly promoted the historic concert - have been hugely embarrassed by the blunder, and have agreed to let Mr Springsteen's entourage off the fines they would have accrued.

Hard at work: A parking attendant was pictured writing a ticket for Bruce Springsteen's tour trucks

The moment was captured yesterday afternoon when a parking attendant was photographed writing a ticket for the huge articulated lorries.

The trucks were parked on double yellow lines outside the venue at the north end of the city centre.

Leeds City Council today stood up for the worker, saying he was just doing his job - but a spokesman acknowledged that the incident had left officials red-faced.

'We accept this is a little embarrassing but, to be fair, the attendant was doing his job - if a little too efficiently,' he said.

Gig: The Boss is the first artist ever to perform at the £60million Leeds Arena, a major project for the city

'These were somewhat unusual circumstances with a very large tour involving a tight turnaround of vehicles arriving from the previous night's show in Cardiff on the opening night of a brand new venue.

'The parking tickets were legitimately issued as the area concerned had double-yellow lines and was outside the agreed area for trucks to park to access the arena.

'Having considered the special circumstances, the tickets were quickly cancelled.

'When you prepare a city to open and host a huge, state-of-the-art new venue, you're bound to get the odd teething trouble.

'This was the only slight problem on a historic night for Leeds as the months and years of planning came together to put on an incredible show which everyone who was there will never forget.'

Landmark: The arena is the first major music venue to be built in Britain's third-largest city

One bystander told the Yorkshire Evening Post: 'A couple of jobsworths have come down here - the stick they have got from people is hilarious.

'They are not parked illegally, they are just parked down a side street.'

Even though Leeds is the third-largest city in the country, with a population of 750,000, it rarely receives visits from the biggest musical acts because it lacks a large arena such as those in Sheffield, Manchester and Nottingham.

The 13,500-seat Leeds Arena is an attempt to remedy this, and it has already topped a list of 'new venues to watch' in the American magazine Billboard.

Mr Springsteen's sell-out appearance last night was the first at the new venue, but the official opening will not be until September, when Sir Elton John plays.

The parking ticket is not the first time the New Jersey rocker has fallen foul of British bureaucracy - last year, officials pulled the plug on his concert in London's Hyde Park when he broke the curfew by teaming up with Paul McCartney for a blockbuster encore.
