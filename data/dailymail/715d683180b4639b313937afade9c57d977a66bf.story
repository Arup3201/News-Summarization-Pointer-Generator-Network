A French baby girl whose mother left her on a beach to drown in the freezing waters of the Channel was buried in a pauper's grave under the name 'X' because she had never been registered as having been born or having lived.

But kind-hearted locals in Boulogne have now turned Adelaide Kabou's grave into a flower-filled shrine after hearing of her plight.

The case of Adelaïde, who was 15 months old, sent shock waves around France when details emerged of how her mother Fabienne Kabou, 36, travelled to Berck sur Mer in November to dispose of her because she was 'incompatible' with her relationship with her artist boyfriend.

Horrific: A CCTV image has been released showing a woman pushing a pram in Berck sur Mer on November 19

Kabou, 36, from Senegal, has since been arrested and charged with her daughter's murder.

She reportedly attempted to cover up her crime by telling her boyfriend that Adelaïde was going to be looked after by relatives in Africa. She faces life imprisonment if found guilty.

But CCTV footage has emerged of 
Kabou pushing little Adelaide to the coast of Berck 
sur Mer on November 19.

The next day, Adelaide was found dead, strapped in a pushchair submerged in the water, by a fisherman.

After ten days of searching nationwide, police used DNA from the pram to trace Ms Kabou to the home she shares with a 
63-year-old man in Paris, where she was arrested.

Ms Kabou, a
 philosophy student, told police she took the drastic move after 
deciding motherhood was 'incompatible' with her love life with 
Adelaide's father.

When news emerged of the child's burial in an unmarked grave in Boulogne, hundreds of locals rallied round and collected money to pay for a gravestone.

Since her burial, Adelaide's grave has been covered with dozens of wreaths and bunches of flowers.

The child's gravestone bears a carved image of a little girl with angel's wings and the words 'Adelaïde, princesse de la plage' - Adelaide, princess of the beach.

At a graveside ceremony yesterday, a 16-year-old girl named Clémence read a message that said: 'Many tears of anger and hatred have been shed but today you rest here.

'The dignity and respect that you deserved have been restored to you. In your memory we offer you this plaque.'

A spokeswoman told French journalists, 'We formed a committee so that this little girl shall not be forgotten and her grave be covered with flowers.

'The gravestone represents also the generosity of people'.
