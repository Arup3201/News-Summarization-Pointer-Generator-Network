Accused: The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is accused of restraining her daughter while her boyfriend repeatedly raped the eight-year-old

Boyfriend: Alberto Hernandez is accused of raping the eight-year-old girl while her mother held her down

The woman, whose name is being withheld to protect her eight-year-old daughter's identity, and her boyfriend Alberto Hernandez, were brought before a judge on Monday.

Franklin county prosecutors allege she restrained her own daughter as her partner raped her on repeated occasions.

The child fled from her mother's house over the weekend, said one of the family's neighbors, whose name local TV channel WSYX ABC 6 also protected. 

 'I guess he tried to rape the 8-year-old, and the little girl had enough strength to get up and get out of there,' the witness told the TV station.

The judge set the mother's bail at $1 million and Hernandez's at $2 million. Authorities returned the girl to her father.
