Darren King, of Derby, was jailed for two years after stealing pictures of his girlfriend's teenage daughter

A paedophile stole pictures of his girlfriend's daughter, who had died of leukaemia, to add to his collection of obscene images.

Darren King, 42, stole family snapshots of the girl taken when she was aged four and partially undressed, after her mother confided in him about her agony at losing her child.

His partner, whom he had befriended only months after her 14-year-old daughter had passed away from the cancer, was devastated when she discovered the pictures in his flat.

She called the police and they found the pervert had thousands of indecent images of other young girls.

King was jailed for two years and afterwards the mother, who cannot be named, said: 'It betrayed my trust.

'He was the first person, other than my family, I had opened up to after I lost my daughter when she was 14.

'I now find it very difficult to trust people.'

Jailing King, from Derby,  on Thursday, October 4 Judge John Gosling said stealing the photographs was 'grotesque'.

He said: 'You stole pictures, taken quite innocently, of the girl partly unclothed.

'She showed you the pictures simply to share her loss with you and you took them to indulge your own fantasies.

'Others (pictures) of her clothed, you left behind.'

The woman, who lost her daughter in 2010, began going out with King later that year.

The mother uncovered King’s perverted behaviour last September after he had asked her to wait for a delivery at his flat.

Police found thousands of images, ranging in levels of obscenity, on the man's computer

While tidying she came across a pile of papers, among which she found the photos of her daughter, which King had taken from her home.

The police arrived the same day and took away computer towers and camera memory cards to analyse.

They found a total of 4,267 indecent images.

The majority were category one the lowest level of indecency but they ranged to category five the most serious level.

King told police he had been looking at these kind of images on the internet for about four years.

He said he would look at them once and then delete them after shooting a photograph of the image on the screen or just taking a mental note.

In court, King pleaded guilty to 23 counts of possessing indecent images.

Laura Finch, in mitigation, said: 'He has acknowledged he has got a problem and desperately wants some help with that.

'He is thoroughly ashamed of his behaviour, especially towards this lady.

'At the time, I don’t think he realised the intrusion of the offence he committed.

'He said he didn’t look at those pictures again because of the guilt he felt.'

King will serve at least half of his sentence in prison.

When he is released on licence, he will need to obey a sexual offences prevention order, which will run for 10 years.

This includes banning him from possessing pictures of anyone under 16, without the parents’ permission, unless they are a blood relative.

He was disqualified for life from working with children and must also sign the Sex Offenders’ Register for 10 years.

After the sentencing, the woman, who was in a relationship with King for a year, said: 'I am glad that he will now get help.

'I now just want to try to get on with my own life now and put it all behind me.'

Investigating officer Detective Constable Steve Fuller said: 'I have dealt with a number of different cases whilst on CID and I would say that this particular crime has had the biggest impact on an individual I have ever seen.

'Happily I believe that the victim has had a lot of support from her family and from partner agencies which has been of great assistance.

'I only hope that the victim is now able to find some closure and I look forward to being able to reunite her with the photographs taken by King which are of massive sentimental value.'
