Authorities believe a 14-year-old northern California girl may have died after drinking vodka mixed with soda during a weekend sleepover.

Police said paramedics found Takeimi Rao dead on her bedroom floor at around 9am on Sunday.

She had hosted a sleepover on Saturday night at the family's exclusive gated Santa Rosa home for three of her friends.

All four of them had become ill and vomited several times during the night, but had blamed the sickness on the hamburgers they ate for dinner.

Sonoma County Sheriff's Lieutenant Steve Brown said Takeimi's mother Aleae Pennette woke up 
during the night and saw the girls throwing up.

She had cleaned them up and put them back to bed.

But the next morning when Ms Pennette
and her partner Scott Moyer went to wake her daughter she was 
unresponsive and had vomited, according to assistant Sonoma County 
Sheriff Lorenzo Dueñas.

Paramedics were called and Takeimi was pronounced dead at the scene.

The parents of the three other girls were told to take them to the hospital for a check-up.

The three girls told authorities that Takeimi had mixed soda and vodka into a water bottle and they had passed it
around, but had not liked the taste, Mr Dueñas said.

At least one of the girls told police Takeimi had only taken a few sips of the drink.

'At this point we are looking at it as an accident,' Mr Dueñas told Press Democrat.

Ms Pennette is said to be distraught 
and feels 'responsible' for what happened, according to the mother of one 
of her daughter's friends.

Angie Williams of Santa Rosa, said: 'It makes us all think, what parent doesn’t have old alcohol sitting in 
our cupboards?

'Takeimi is a good girl and Aleae is such a good mom.'

Takeimi had just graduated from Rincon Valley Middle School. The principle, Matt Marshall, called her an 'outstanding student'.

One of Takeimi's closest friends, Danielle Codding, 14, had been in church when she heard the news about her death.

Danielle, who had been invited to the sleepover but was not able to go, said drinking alcohol was completely out of character for her friend.

'She's never done that before,' Danielle said. 'And 
she was one of those people that told me to listen.

'She was always watching over me and making sure I was 
making the right choices.'

Danielle had been at Mt Gilead Bible Camp in Sebastopol with Takeimi, according to her mother Michaela.

One of Takeimi's classmates, Spencer Metela, said she had been a gifted singer and dancer. 'She had to dance and she was very good at it,' he told the Press Democrat.

'She was talkative, always very nice to everyone. She had a lot of friends.'

A Facebook memorial group had today attracted 1,197 people.

Alyssa Moore, who had known Takeimi from drama classes, wrote: 'You were so bubbly and such a talented dancer. You were very sweet and you will be missed. RIP.'

Jessie Apodaca wrote: 'Nobody this young and beautiful should have passed away. Hopefully this will all teach us a lesson. Somebody should have been there to prevent it.'

The results of an autopsy, carried out yesterday, were inconclusive and toxicology results could take several weeks.
