Bitter battle: Jennifer Grubb, 55, outside London's Appeal Court after she won her fight to hang on to a £4.4m divorce package

A divorcee has won her battle to hold on to a £4.4million slice of her ex-husband's ancestral fortune despite contributing nothing to their shared wealth.

Jennifer Grubb, 55, was awarded a £2million nine-bedroom country house set in 40 acres of parkland, £75,000 a year for child maintenance, a £1.65million lump sum to meet her 'reasonable needs' and other assets after splitting with Anthony Arbuthnot Watkins Grubb in July 2009.

A High Court judge agreed on the division of the couple's £12million estate in August, after describing the couple's wealth as 'not the product of the endeavours' of either of them.

Mr Grubb, 61, a chartered surveyor, yesterday challenged the decision at the Court of Appeal, claiming he had 'arguably contributed 100 per cent' to the fortune – most of which has been in his family for years.

However, yesterday the court upheld the original judgment.

The ruling comes amid claims that courts have lost touch with the idea of 'reasonable needs' for wives in big-money divorce cases.

Lord Justice Thorpe, sitting with Lady Justice Hallett and Sir Stephen Sedley, heard that Mrs Grubb was given Damerel, the couple's former home in North Chailey, East Sussex – and £75,000 for renovations – following the original High Court hearing.

The house, set over three storeys, was described as having 'large gardens, woodlands, lakes, a tennis court and swimming pool'.

The couple, who married in 1985, raised their five children there before moving to the £2million Mayes House in East Grinstead, West Sussex.

Jonathan Southgate, representing Mr Grubb, attacked Mrs Grubb's award as 'exorbitant'.

He described the house as 'enormous' and far beyond her 'reasonable needs' now that most of the former couple's children, aged between 15 and 30, have flown the nest.

'The word “needs” has been hollowed out and we have lost connection with it,' the barrister said. 'A nine-bedroom property of this stature was clearly over and beyond her needs.'

However, Richard Anelay QC, for Mrs Grubb, argued that her ex-husband should count himself lucky to have only lost about a third of his ancestral wealth.

'The wife's award represented less 
than 50 per cent of the assets,' he told the court. 'Although Damerel is
described as nine-bedroomed, three of the rooms are very small, or 
tiny.'

Lord Justice Thorpe said: 'You can say
the property was so large or valuable that the judge was plainly wrong 
to give it to her. That is easy to understand but difficult to succeed 
on in an appeal, because it is a matter of discretion. I can see no 
trace of error, or the slightest chance of succeeding on an appeal.'

After the hearing, Mr Grubb said: 
'It's a funny old system, but there you go.'

He inherited a vast 
fortune, including several farms, a substantial shares portfolio and a 
shooting estate, following the death of his father.

The source of the Grubbs' wealth was a large manufacturing business, which was floated in the 1950s and sold in the 1980s.

The legal costs of Mr and Mrs Grubb's divorce have been estimated at almost £700,000.
