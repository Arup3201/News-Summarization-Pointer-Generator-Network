Despite the individual honours and the England highs, this ranks as one of the best days in the career of Stuart Pearce. As Ben Osborn rattled in a stunning injury-time winner, the ecstatic Nottingham Forest manager ran onto the pitch. Think that penalty against Spain in Euro 96; think typical Pearce.

‘Psycho is back’, the Forest fans roared in one corner of the iPro Stadium.

Pearce threw out his chest, raising an arm high in the air to let them know they are in this together. He has suffered a fortnight from hell but there are signs of life. He looked like his old self.

To come back from a goal down with 15 minutes remaining against a team who had conceded just two home goals since early November is one thing but to do it in your arch-rivals’ back yard is another. These are only three points but the way in which they were earned is rather more important.

It appeared more than good enough when Britt Assombalonga swivelled inside the six-yard box to scramble in an equaliser. Pearce spun round to the bench to perform his legendary punching celebration and it got better when 20-year-old Osborn scored his first professional goal. What a place to get it.

‘All my mates are Derby fans, I was getting messages from them last night saying don’t score the winner,’ Osborn, an academy product, beamed. He has bought his boss plenty more time now.

And Pearce knows it. ‘I’m entrenched in Nottingham,’ he said. ‘This is more than just a job for me, let’s be honest. I enjoy football at the all-or-nothing end of it.

‘The players realised there’s nothing to fear here, gentlemen. All that pressure we’ve heaped upon ourselves was relieved by a touch.’

A Derby supporter confronted Forest centre-back Kelvin Wilson at full time, failing to land two punches before being rugby tackled to the ground by Jamaal Lascelles, but nothing could ruin Forest’s day.

Oddly, it could all have been very different. Pearce might have found himself staring down the barrel. Danny Mills, who played under him at Manchester City, said yesterday morning that players are not stupid; that they suss his faux motivation early on.

The reply was measured: ‘I’m not interested in what Danny’s had to say,’ said Pearce. ‘I do apologise to him for putting Micah Richards in his place at Man City.

‘I know my limitations, as a man, I know my limitations as a coach. I think I’m improving, I’ve got a continual mentality to want to improve game by game and I’m pretty unshakeable in terms of criticism.’

Mills was later proved wrong after Forest had held a pre-match Churchillian team meeting.

It looked bad when Henri Lansbury got them off to a torrid start by inexplicably diverting the ball into his own net unchallenged from a corner in the 16th minute.

From then until half-time, Forest were a mess. They were nervous, the occasion clearly getting to them. The manager was jittery on the touchline, unable to stand still, and was angered by referee Andy Madley’s refusal to award a penalty when Jake Buxton held Michail Antonio’s shirt at a corner. 

One supporter ran onto the pitch at the final whistle and attempted to attack the Forest players 

The supporter was quickly bundled to the ground by stewards and detained

But, as so often happens in the Championship, the landscape changed in a flash, leaving Derby manager Steve McClaren fuming: ‘We showed our total immaturity in this game — we got overexcited and lost our shape.’

Derby had been incapable of clearing a routine free-kick and £5.5miilion signing Assombalonga stabbed the ball home inside the six-yard box, sparking delirium.

Pearce became even more excited when Osborn waltzed untracked to smash the winner in stoppage time. As the manager ran onto the pitch, he might just have been thinking that this was the moment his career changes for the better.
