They are among the most fearsome creatures on earth, but this killer shark looks as though it is flashing a massive grin as it comes face-to-face with a daring photographer.

Far from trying to rip 26-year-old cameraman Zach Ransom to shreds with its deadly knashers, it instead appears to pull a series of poses which reveal a somewhat friendlier side.

Incredibly, the stunning pictures were taken my Mr Ransom without the safety of a protective cage.

Jaws-dropping: A fearsome shark gets up close and personal with cameraman Zach Ransom - and appears to flash him a grin

Smile! The deadly creature flashes his pearly whites as snapper Zach tries his luck and gets ever closer

Poser: The shark strikes another grin for the cameras and is photobombed by a friend

The aquarist at Seaworld Orlando went under water with his friends at Little Bahama Bank in the Bahamas to get the incredible images.

The area is a hotspot for tiger sharks, as well as species such as lemon shark and reef shark, allowing the divers to get up close and personal with the potentially dangerous animals.

Mr Ransom, from Orlando, Florida, said: 'I've always loved the ocean since I was a child. I think most children start out with a love of sharks, dinosaurs and outer space - I just never grew out of it.

'I have been diving for 14 years now and most of that time has been spent in search of sharks.

'This location north of West End, Grand Bahama, is an incredible area with relatively untouched coral reefs and some of the healthiest shark populations on the planet.

Daring: Zach got so close to the sharks he was able to touch them

Fearless: Zach, from Orlando, Florida, opted to go underwater without any protection from a cage

Surrounded: Zach is circled by three sharks hut is unmoved as he continues to take his incredible pictures

'Sharing the water with such an immense and powerful creature is thrilling for sure but the experience is so much more than that.

'I feel completely calm and at peace in these situations. Sharks are amazingly deliberate and cautious in their movements and though a highly instinctual animal they still display curiosity with regard to the novelties in their world.

'Eye contact is an important part of being in close quarters with large sharks, when you break your gaze, they often decide it's safe to move a little closer.

'So to capture these moments with my camera and share them with the world in hope of possibly breaking some negative stereotypes, that is the payoff for me.

'And if I can play some minuscule role in preventing a species from going extinct in my lifetime then that is my purpose.'

Zach argues that while activist groups, film makers and photographers are turning the tide in shark conservation, there is still more that needs to be done to protect them.

That's more like it: This shark strikes a more traditional pose

Razor sharp: These teeth could do some serious damage but Zach was undeterred

Endangered: Some shark species have dropped by up to 90 per cent

Under threat: Every year between 20 and 100 million sharks are killed by fishing activity

He added: 'People flock from around the world to see African lions in their natural environment, however, none dare to leave the relative safety of the safari vehicle.

'This is of course due to an innate respect for the apex predator of the ecosystem. Thousands of people interact with sharks everyday unprotected, without incident.

'Lions are often revered and respected as beautiful creatures, iconic to the continent of Africa. As the apex predators of the ocean, sharks should be regarded with the same esteem.

'Every year between 20 and 100 million sharks are killed from fishing activity. As many species are slow to mature and may only produce one pup a year it doesn't bode well for long term population.

'Some species' populations have dropped 50-90% but in recent years many people have become aware of the plight that sharks face with regard to the fining industry and over fishing in general.

'Although the numbers are quite grim - I still have hope that it's not too late.'
