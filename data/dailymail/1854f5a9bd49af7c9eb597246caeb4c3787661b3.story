Forget trendy toys - all one little girl wanted for Christmas was her military father home early from Afghanistan. And this week, that wish came true. 

A camera crew captured the heartwarming homecoming surprise at BB Owen Elementary School in Texas on Tuesday.

Kennedy Shaw was filmed as she got up on stage  to unwrap a giant bow-wrapped present she 'won' during a rigged raffle.

Footage shows her tackling the gift while her peers watch on, then all of a sudden her father jumps out and she can barely contain her excitement.

Caught on camera: Kennedy Shaw got her Christmas wish early this week when her military father staged a festive homecoming surprise

Shocked: Sgt. Jayson Shaw got teachers at Kennedy's school to wrap him up in a big box - his daughter was then called up to the stage to open the parcel after 'winning' it in a rigged raffle

Dad's home! The 5th grader could hardly contain her excitement when she saw what was inside 

Overwhelmed: Kennedy expected her father back home  from Afghanistan next spring 

Reunited: The family now plan on spending lots of time together over the holidays

Kennedy is seen lurching back in shock, before putting her hands over mouth and squealing.

She then goes to give her father a big hug.

Sergeant Jayson Shaw was deployed overseas in June to manage properties.

He wasn't expected home until at least March 2015, but due to U.S. military operations being scaled back he was sent home early.

He surprised his mother and brother when he arrived back in North Texas at their homes but decided to do something extra special for his daughter.

He coordinated with Kennedy's school and managed to get a large box donated by Home Depot.

Crowd-pleaser: The surprise homecoming was watched by dozens of spectators 

Emotional moment: After the grand reveal, Shaw's tearful daughter Kennedy said: 'I thought he was going to be back, like, towards my birthday in April or something'

Teachers made it look like a present and wrapped Shaw in it. 

After the grand reveal, his tearful daughter Kennedy told NBC News: 'I thought he was going to be back, like, towards my birthday in April or something.'

She added that it was by far the best gift she could have wished for and doesn't need anything else for Christmas.

The family are now looking forward to spending time together over the holidays.

'It's definitely a blessing. I'm just so happy to have him home for Christmas. I'm so happy,' Shaw's mother, Kennedy's grandmother, said.
