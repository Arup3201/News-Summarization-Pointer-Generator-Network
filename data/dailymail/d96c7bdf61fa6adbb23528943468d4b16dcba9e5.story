Chelsea have discussed a proposed partnership with Besiktas, in a move that could see Blues players sent to Turkey on loan.

The two clubs are said to be close to confirming a collaboration which would involve close co-operation between the first teams and academies; offering training support and joint scouting projects.

But perhaps the most intriguing feature of the agreement will see potential loan moves for Blues academy players.

Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho may be able to send players on loan to Besiktas if a partnership is agreed

It is understood BesiktaÅŸ will model their academy on Chelsea's and the Premier League outfit will offer expertise in developing their youth system.

Black Eagles board member Erdal Torunogullari is believed to have recently completed a trip to the Chelsea's Cobham HQ as part of the agreement.
