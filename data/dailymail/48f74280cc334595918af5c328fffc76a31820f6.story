Carlo Ancelotti has vanquished any suggestions of Angel di Maria leaving this summer by confirming that he is an important player for Real Madrid.

The Argentine winger's future at the club had been under some doubt after the big-money signings of Toni Kroos and James Rodriguez, and the club have been reportedly looking to offload the likes of Di Maria, Isco and Sami Khedira to finance the deals.

And he has been linked with a move to a host of Europe's top clubs such as Manchester United and Paris Saint-German.VIDEO Scroll down to see James Rodriguez wow crowd during presentation

Staying put: Ancelotti insists that Di Maria is going nowhere

But Ancelotti underlined the fact that 
Di Maria has a place at the Bernabeu, and that competition will be vital
 if Real Madrid are to match and exceed the success of last season - 
where they won the Copa del Rey and Champions League.

'Di Maria is a Madrid player,' he said. 'It is clear that, with the arrival of James and Kroos, there is more competition but all the big clubs have competition and that gives energy to the team.'

'Last year we had problems at the end of the season with injuries that were not very good and with these two players [Rodriguez and Kroos] we have the ability to reach the end of the season without problems.'

Di Maria signed for Real Madrid from Benfica in 2010, and has gone on to score 36 goals in 189 games for the club. He was most recently playing for Argentina at the World Cup in Brazil, where injury prevented him from playing in the final as they lost 1-0 to Germany.
