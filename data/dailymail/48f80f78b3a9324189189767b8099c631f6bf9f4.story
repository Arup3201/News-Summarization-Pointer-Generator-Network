A boy of four was left in agony after pharmacists  mistakenly gave him powerful ear drops to deal with an eye infection.

Archie Battersbee had been prescribed eye drops by a doctor to ease a bout of conjunctivitis.But the youngster was left  screaming in pain after blundering pharmacists at a Boots store handed his mother the ear medication instead.

The astonishing mix-up left him  with a burn around his right eye.

Archie screamed in pain after Miss Dance put the medication in his eye

His
 mother, Hollie Dance, said: ‘I put [the drops] in and Archie was 
absolutely  screaming, so I read the box closely and it said they were  
ear drops.

‘Fortunately,
 I only used it once on Archie, but they’re ten times as  strong as the 
eye drops so even then you could see it had  burned the  skin around the
 corner of his eye.

‘I went back to kick off at Boots and made a formal complaint.

‘They
 have now apologised and given us the right drops.’ Archie, who started 
school earlier this month, is now terrified of  allowing anyone to put 
medication in his eyes following his ordeal.

Miss Dance, from Southend-on-Sea in Essex, added: ‘Unsurprisingly, Archie was scared of anything else going in his eye.

‘I
 eventually managed to get them in and he said it didn’t hurt at all, 
which is what it should’ve been like all along.’ It is not the first 
time  such a mix-up has occurred at a Boots store.

Logan Morley, six, was mistakenly given ear drops to treat conjunctivitis at a branch in Nottingham  in 2012.

She suffered burning and swelling around her eyes after her parents used the medication on her.

Logan
 had been given the correct prescription at an NHS walk-in centre, only 
for the pharmacists to hand out the wrong medication.

Her
 mother Claire Morley said the box was marked ear drops but the 
prescription sticker, which was signed by two people, had stated eye 
drops.

Logan was taken to hospital, where she was given a cream to treat her burning, bloodshot eyes.

Speaking at the time, Mrs Morley said: ‘It is ridiculous. I can’t believe they made such a mistake.

‘You never think to check it. You would like to think they had given you the right medicine.’

As
 well as apologising to Archie and his mother for the error, Boots says 
changes have been made to prevent the mistake from being repeated.

A spokesman said: ‘We would like to once again offer our sincere apologies to the family.

‘At Boots UK, we treat any incident involving patient safety with the utmost importance.

‘After
 this incident, a thorough investigation was conducted  and appropriate 
remedial action was undertaken to ensure that  any necessary measures  
were implemented.’

Six-year-old Logan Morley was left with swollen, bloodshot eyes after she was given the wrong medication

Boots Pharmacy has previously made the same mistake when it issued Logan Morley's parents with ear drops to treat an eye infection in 2012.

The six-year-old was given the correct prescription by an NHS Walk-In centre in Nottingham but was given ear drops by pharmacists at Boots the Chemist on Riverside Retail Park in the city.

Her mother Claire Morley said the box was marked ear drops but the prescription sticker, which was signed by two people, had stated eye drops.

The drops caused a burning pain and Logan was left with swollen, bloodshot eyes and was taken to the Queen's Medical Centre, where she was given a cream to treat them.

Speaking at the time, Mrs Morley, said: ‘It is ridiculous. I can’t believe they made such a mistake.

‘You never think to check it. You would like to think they had given you the right medicine.’ 

Tony Avery, Professor of Primary Care at the University of Nottingham’s Medical School, who conducts research into patient safety, said: ‘Overall, the rate of prescription errors in community pharmacies is quite low.

‘It’s less than one in 50, but often we are talking about very, very minor errors.

‘I’m not expert enough to say whether putting it in the eye at this high a dose would be likely to cause problems.

‘But clearly the dose of 0.5 per cent (of chloramphenicol) is designed for the eye, and the membrane of the eye is much more superficial than the ear, and you have got to be aware of how sensitive the eye is.

‘I would be surprised if giving it at five per cent would cause a sight-threatening adverse reaction.’
