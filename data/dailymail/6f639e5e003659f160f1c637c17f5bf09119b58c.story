Leeds United are close to signing Sol Bamba on loan from Palermo.

The Championship club are struggling near the relegation zone and manager Neil Redfearn is desperate to strengthen his squad. 

Reports from Italy claim that Leeds chairman Massimo Cellino has sounded out Palermo president Maurizio Zamparini about a loan deal for the player.

Ivory Coast defender Bamba joined Palermo on a free transfer in the summer after two years in Turkey with Trabzonspor. He has previous Championship experience with Leicester City.

Leeds United are also showing an interest in Celtic striker Anthony Stokes. The former Arsenal and Sunderland forward is keen to move back to England and the club want him to help steer them out of their current malaise. 

The difficulty is that they are under a transfer embargo so any deal would have to be done on an initial loan.

The 26-year-old has scored eight goals this season and also attracted interest from Cardiff.
