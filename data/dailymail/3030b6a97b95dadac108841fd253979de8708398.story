Entertainers, actors and priests are now claimed to be part of a VIP child abuse ring that Scotland Yard stands accused of covering up.

The paedophiles were initially said to include MPs, senior police officers, and judges, but now investigators have revealed the net has been widened further.

Over 30 years, officers from Scotland Yard are said to have also protected entertainers, actor, and priest by shutting down inquiries.

The police watchdog has now added a further three alleged paedophilia cover-ups by the Metropolitan Police to the investigation, bring the total to 17

The police watchdog has now added a further three alleged paedophilia cover-ups by the Metropolitan Police to the investigation, bring the total to 17. 

In a statement the IPCC said the police investigation had 'gathered evidence against MPs, judges, media entertainers, police, actors, clergy and others'.

Criminal proceedings were being prepared, but two months later an officer was called in by a senior Metropolitan Police officer and told to drop the case, it is alleged.

The IPCC is also looking into an allegation about police actions during a child abuse investigation in the 1980s, and another complaint about the same investigation - although no details of this have been given.

Allegations: Sarah Green of the IPCC will oversee the investigation into the corruption claims

The watchdog said all the allegations relate to 'suppressing evidence, hindering or halting investigations' and the 'covering up the offences because of the involvement of members of parliament and police officers'.

When the probe was announced earlier this month, commentators said It could be the biggest investigation into police corruption since the 1970s.

The Metropolitan Police force is leading the investigation into the alleged corrupt actions of its officers but the IPCC says it is closely monitoring their probe.

The IPCC had last week announced that it is investigating 14 allegations.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is also assessing a further six referrals it has received from the force as part of the case. 

When the investigation was launched The IPCC Deputy Chair Sarah Green said: 'These allegations are of historic, high level corruption of the most serious nature.

'We will oversee the investigations and ensure that they meet the terms of reference that we will set. 

'Allegations of this nature are of grave concern and I would like to reassure people of our absolute commitment to ensuring that the investigations are thorough and robust.'

The complex web of allegations was uncovered by detectives probing claims of historical sex abuse first raised by Labour MP Tom Watson in October 2012. 

The claims include that police deliberately stalled their inquiries into the Elm Guest House, in Barnes, south-west London, leaving dozens of boys to be abused.

Officers are also accused of releasing paedophile MP Cyril Smith without charge after he was caught in an undercover operation at a sex party involving teenage boys

Officers are also accused of releasing paedophile MP Cyril Smith without charge after he was caught in an undercover operation at a sex party involving teenage boys.

It has also been claimed officers failed to end sex parties at the now notorious Dolphin Square complex, in Pimlico, central London, following the intervention of ‘prominent people’.

Tory home secretary, William Whitelaw, who is accused of demanding that police drop an inquiry into a paedophile ring, is also under the spotlight.  As is former Home Secretary Leon Brittan. Both men have since died.

Police were accused of hushing-up allegations about disgraced ex-Top Of The Pops  presenter Jimmy Savile
