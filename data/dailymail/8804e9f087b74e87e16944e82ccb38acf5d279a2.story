A mom in North Dakota was so upset by her 18-year-old daughter’s recent behavior that she sold the girl’s tickets to see Katy Perry in concert next month as punishment.

Cindy Bjerke of Fargo posted a short ad on the Fargo Moorhead Online Garage Sale Facebook page in order to discipline her daughter.

Bjerke didn’t name her daughter but described her in unflattering terms as a ‘spoiled brat’ who ‘doesn't deserve these tickets’.

The tickets were for the Dark Horses hit maker’s upcoming show in Fargo on August 23. Even though the tickets are worth $110, Bjerke willing accepted $90 for them.

She needn’t have worried about getting rid of the tickets as they sold in under five minutes and her ‘spoiled brat’ message received over 200 likes in just an hour.

Bjerke hasn't said specifically what her daughter did, but the way she has chosen to discipline the girl has caused some controversy.

The mom’s punishment has been criticized as harsh by some,  who believe that the matter should have been handled privately rather than with a public shaming on Facebook.

Bjerke says she has no regrets and that the majority of comments she has received have been overwhelming positive.

‘I
 think a lot of parents are like me and feel they are being bullied over
 how they should parent their own children,’ she told WDAZ8.

The Facebook page where the ticket sale was posted is in fact a closed group, which people have to ask permission to join.

The
 post so only visible to the 17,000 members of the group and the page 
administrator reportedly deleted it on the grounds that it distracting 
from the purpose.

The
 American leg of Perry's Prismatic World Tour started last month in 
North Carolina and last week she performed at the Barclay's Center in 
Brooklyn. The U.S. leg ends in Oct before she goes on to visit Canada 
and then Australia.

The
 tour has been winning rave reviews for the Teenage Dream singer. It 
features a wide array of colorful costumes and wigs and a selection of 
Perry’s hits old as well as new, including California Gurls, Wide Awake 
and Part Of Me.
