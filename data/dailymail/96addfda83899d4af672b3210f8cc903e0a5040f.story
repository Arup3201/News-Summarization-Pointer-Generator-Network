Ultimately, he couldn’t see the job through to the end. Louis van Gaal’s dreams of heading to the Barclays Premier League with the ultimate stamp on his CV were dashed by the trauma of a penalty shoot-out at Arena Corinthians on Wednesday night.

At Old Trafford, they will perhaps not rue Holland’s exit too much as they prepare for the arrival of a coach who must get things right quickly if the damage of the David Moyes months is to be undone over the course of the new season.

Van Gaal’s
 schedule looks rather daunting. After a third-place play-off game 
against Brazil on Saturday, Van Gaal will fly back to Holland with his 
squad before heading to Manchester on Tuesday where his wife Truus has 
already found a house in Cheshire.

It is likely that United will officially unveil the 62-year-old as their new manager at a press conference in the middle of the week, before Van Gaal joins the club’s squad on a two-week tour of America that begins next weekend.

It is understood United would have granted Van Gaal a short break had he felt he needed one, but that the former Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Ajax manager indicated he wished to begin work as soon as possible. ‘Holidays are for wimps,’ was the way one United official put it recently.

Certainly, United supporters will have been encouraged by what they have seen of their new manager in Brazil. The Dutchman has arguably emerged as the outstanding coach of the World Cup.

Moyes was criticised for many things during his difficult season at United. Some of it was unfair but much wasn’t.

Accusations of tactical rigidity were certainly understandable and Moyes occasionally took a peculiar approach to the use of substitutions.

In Van Gaal, United have a coach willing to change his tactical approach dramatically for individual games and also make big calls during matches.

We know about the big stories of Van Gaal’s World Cup: his decision to bring on Tim Krul as a specialist penalty-saver for the quarter-final shoot-out against Costa Rica; his use of former Liverpool striker Dirk Kuyt as a wing back.

Van Gaal’s work went deeper than that, though. He was clever enough to make the previously disenfranchised Robin van Persie his captain earlier in his reign but not afraid to bring the United striker off — and then explain publicly why — when he wasn’t playing well enough.

Equally, he was brave enough to ask Holland to play in a withdrawn counter-attacking fashion that flew in the face of Oranje traditions.

He did it because he knew his squad wasn’t good enough to play any other way. ‘Functional’ was how he described this group of players. He had a close enough bond with them to get away with that term.

Style can be everything at United, but Van Gaal does not have a reputation as a defensive coach at club level.

Close knit: Van Gaal had the full respect of the Holland squad

There is no reason to suggest he is going to turn up at Carrington and ask United to play five across the back. He would have to locate three decent central defenders first.

Nevertheless, the ability he has shown to make the most of what he has could be invaluable as he works with a squad that will perhaps not be of the quality he needs until after another couple of transfer windows.

Under Sir Alex Ferguson in his later years, United over-performed. Under Moyes, the same players regressed to such an extent as to be almost unrecognisable.

1) MEDALS: United’s dressing room needs to be impressed after years of success under Sir Alex Ferguson. Van Gaal’s c.v. passes muster.

2) CONFIDENCE: Press conferences in the World Cup would often contain rambling Van Gaal soliloquies where he explained the nuances of his tactical genius. Boring but telling.

3) PLAYERS: Don’t be surprised if he brings one or two players from his successful Dutch World Cup squad to Old Trafford, even if they are for the fringes. Keep your eye on Nigel de Jong and Dirk Kuyt.

4) TACTICS: Van Gaal sees himself as one of the game’s great thinkers. That would make him a dull dinner companion — but a talented coach.

5) BELIEF: One of Van Gaal’s great successes in Brazil was to get his team playing above themselves and believing they could achieve things. United will be hoping for some of that magic dust.

Van Gaal’s first job is to perhaps find 
the middle ground between the two and the evidence of this World Cup 
suggests he may do that.

Van Gaal’s control of his players in South America has been interesting.

His reputation is one of rigidity but he got his players to buy into his methods and to follow him. He will need that at United.

There is something of a ‘medals on the table’ culture in United’s dressing room.

The fact Moyes didn’t have any did for him.

Van Gaal’s reputation and career will buy him time at United, although it will be interesting to see if he attempts to ‘out’ any of his players as he did here in the wake of Wednesday’s exit.

He suggested that two of his Dutch players hadn’t fancied a penalty in Sao Paulo.

It was an odd move that ran contrary to just about everything he has done out here.

Perhaps he
 couldn’t face accepting the blame for the fact he asked a central 
defender, Aston Villa’s Ron Vlaar, to take the first kick (Vlaar 
missed).

Second thoughts: Van Gaal's faith in Ron Vlaar backfired after he missed his penalty kick

Perhaps he felt he could get away with it because he is leaving the Dutch set up. Perhaps he was just a little emotional and regrets it now.

Whatever the case, if he tries that in England he may find some players in the United dressing room turn their backs quicker than he ever could have imagined.

To the neutral, it did at least prove one thing. It would appear the ‘Iron Tulip’ is human after all.
