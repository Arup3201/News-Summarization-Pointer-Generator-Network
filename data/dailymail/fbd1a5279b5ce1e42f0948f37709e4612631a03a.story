Joel Clark, 37, charged with killing domestic animal and torture in Indiana after he baked a friend's dog

A house guest is facing felony charges after he allegedly killed a friend's dog by putting the canine in a sweltering oven.

Joel Clark, 37, was being held on Thursday at the Marion County Jail in Indiana.

He faces charges of killing a domestic animal and torturing or mutilating a vertebrate animal, according to new court documents. 

Prosecutors said Clark was on house arrest and living with two friends, Christina Kelley and Richard Smith at the time.

Miss Kelley found Zane, a Miniature Pinscher, dead on May 18.

The little dog was discovered in the bottom of a trash can.

The woman was then horrified to discover dog hair and a toenail on a cookie sheet and pizza pan in the oven, court documents said.

A necropsy found that the dog's whiskers were burned, it had burn marks on its legs and feet and blood on its snout and mouth.

Court documents said Clark told one of the friends that he had killed the dog about 30 minutes before its body was discovered, but they did not believe him. 

The dog's owners had no idea of Clark's motive.

He also told one of the friends that he 'could take care of that dog, too' when a pitbull walked past them, the documents said.

The friends ordered Clark to leave their home after they found Zane dead, court documents said.

Miss Kelley and Mr Smith said that they were aghast by the death of their pet and totally bewildered because no argument had taken place before the brutal killing, according to the Indy Star. 

Along with the animal cruelty charges, Clark has also been charged with escape relating to the violation of his house arrest for allegedly resisting a previous arrest. 

He will appear in court on Wednesday for a pre-trial hearing.
