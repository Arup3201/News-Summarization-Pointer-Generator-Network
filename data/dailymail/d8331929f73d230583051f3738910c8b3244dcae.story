A huge road, rail and house-building programme worth £100billion is to be unveiled by the government tomorrow.

George Osborne promised huge new investment in infrastructure projects, spending £50billion every year until 2020.

But Labour dismissed the package as a ‘con’ claiming there was no new money with budgets actually being cut.

The government is pinning its hopes on securing the economic recovery by diverting money into large-scale construction projects.

Ministers will tomorrow unveil details of billions of pounds of road and rail upgrades, new energy projects including investment in nuclear and renewables and thousands of new affordable homes.

Mr Osborne told the Commons: ‘Successive governments of all colours have put short term pressures over the long term needs and refused to commit to capital spending plans that match the horizons of a modern economy.

‘Today we change that. We commit now to £50 billion pounds of capital investment in 2015.

‘From roads to railways, bridges to broadband, science to schools… it will amount to over £300 billion of capital spending guaranteed to the end of this decade.’

But Labour dismissed the statement as a ‘con’, pointing out that there was no new money for infrastructure.

The £50 billion capital spending announced for 2015-16 amounted to a 1.7 per cent cut in real terms, Labour claimed.

Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: ‘They have done nothing – zero. It's a complete capital spending con. There is nothing here.’

In March the government pledged £300 billion of capital spending by 2020.

Mr Osborne said the first £50 billion would be spent in 2015-16, the year covered by the spending review.

That was more on average as a proportion of national income over the decade than between 2000 and 2010, he said, as he sought to counter criticisms he has failed to do enough to spur growth.

Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander will tomorrow give details of where the first £100billion of the £300billion total will be spent.

The Department for Transport capital budget has been boosted to a guaranteed £9.5 billion a year for the rest of the decade.

Mr Osborne said this would pay for the biggest investment in roads for 50 years and ‘the largest investment in our railways since the Victorian age’.

Mayor of London Boris Johnson welcomed a big boost - a grant of £925 million in 2015/16 rising to just over £1 billion by 2020/21 on top of enhanced borrowing powers to fund transport in the capital.

Science - an area the Government has been accused of neglecting - will see its capital budget increase from £0.6 billion to £1.1 billion as part of a 9per cent rise in capital investment at the Department of Business Innovation and Skills. Mr Osborne also outlined commitments to new flood defences.

Capital funding for education would be £4.6 billion in 2015-16 - part of a £21 billion package over the 2015-20 parliament - which would ‘tackle the backlog of maintenance in existing schools and invest in new school places’, he indicated.

And there would be £3 billion capital investment in affordable housing.

John Cridland, CBI Director-General, said: ‘Infrastructure is rightly singled out as the most effective engine for growth, as we urged.

‘While the Government talks a good game on infrastructure we've seen too little delivery on the ground so far.

‘It is critical we see a real pipeline of projects announced tomorrow, so investors know what schemes are going ahead, where and when.’

Institution of Civil Engineers director general, Nick Baveystock, said: ‘The severe infrastructure investment cuts made in the 2010 spending review have begun to bite and are undermining the sector's ability to stimulate growth or job creation, so we are encouraged to see a review with actual infrastructure investment at its heart.

‘The increase in capital expenditure and funding certainty for key programmes appears to be positive news and could provide a platform for the industry to deliver on national needs more effectively.

‘It is however, not all good news for infrastructure. Departmental cuts will inevitably place further pressure on local authority budgets, with road maintenance likely to suffer the brunt.’
