This kitten might have just proved wrong the long-debated myth that all cats hate water.

Diego, a Bengal cat, was filmed swimming for the first time at a beach in New Zealand.

While this may leave many confused, no one was more shocked than Diego's owners who were in utter disbelief when their pet began to tread water.

The video shows the cat as it appears to be testing the water. 

'He's crazy, he's in the water,' the man said as he held onto the cat's leash.

Diego then decides to go for a swim as the water becomes deeper.

The owners are evidently amused and stunned by their pet's new-found talent.

'He's swimming! He's swimming! He's swimming in the water,' they yelled.

'He's doing doggy paddle!

'He's actually swimming. He doesn't even look concerned about it.' 

The video has recently been viewed and shared by thousands of viewers.

It was however filmed back in 2011  and uploaded on YouTube by owner Michelle Holmes.
