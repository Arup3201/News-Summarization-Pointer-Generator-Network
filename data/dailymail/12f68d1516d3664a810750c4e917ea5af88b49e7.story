Fulham's slim hopes of Barclays Premier League survival have been dealt a hefty double blow after Damien Duff was ruled out for the season and Scott Parker broke down with a knee injury.

Manager Felix Magath also raised significant questions yesterday over whether Lewis Holtby is enough of a 'fighter' for Fulham's relegation battle and indicated that record signing Kostas Mitroglou injured his hamstring on international duty with Greece.

The mystery of when the Â£12million Greek will be deemed ready continues, with Magath claiming he 'needs time to adapt' to the Premier League.

With a trip to relegation rivals Cardiff on Saturday, the timing of the latest set-backs could not be worse for Fulham. Yet Magath insisted that he is 'convinced' the bottom-placed club can stay up.

They will have to do so with Duff, who Magath revealed is set to miss the rest of the season with a knee injury that 'maybe' will need surgery.

Parker has also been ruled out after injuring his knee in training on Wednesday, while Magath insinuated that Holtby, who was left on the bench in last weekend's defeat against Chelsea, lacks the defensive qualities that his struggling side needs.

Magath said: 'I can only repeat that now is not the time to play very well, now is the time to fight. Holtby is not a fighter. He is very smart, skilful, offensive player with very good passes.

'The game against Chelsea, the best team in the league, we did not have much space to create chances and therefore he was out for that game. Saturday is another game.'
