Benchmarks: Andrew Lansley, the Health Secretary, wants NHS doctors and hospitals to be graded

Andrew Lansley was yesterday accused of creating a ‘recipe for chaos’ after introducing more than 60 performance goals despite a previous promise to scrap targets.

The Health Secretary unveiled a series of benchmarks - designed to save more than 10,000 lives, and that he claims will measure whether patient care is improving by covering a range of treatments across the NHS.

When Mr Lansley took over as health secretary last year he promised to ‘free’ the NHS from unnecessary targets to enable doctors to concentrate more on patient care. 

He abolished a series of goals brought in by Labour, including the four-hour wait in A&E. 

And he has insisted that his new measures are different as they focus on patient results.

In a speech at Guy’s hospital in Central London yesterday, Mr Lansley promised to ‘dispense with the jargon’, adding: ‘We make it clear that the NHS has one ambition and one ambition alone – improving results for patients.’

However Labour health spokesman Andy Burnham said: ‘Doctors and nurses will roll their eyes in sheer disbelief at this news. This is inept and no way to run the NHS. It’s a recipe for complexity and chaos when the NHS needs to be allowed to get on with the job.’

Figures on hospital death rates, the 
performances of GPs and surgeons and patients’ experiences will be 
published as part of the NHS Outcomes Framework.

The Government's reforms of the NHS "continue to cause chaos" on the ground, doctors leaders said today.

The British Medical Association (BMA), which opposes the Health and 
Social Care Bill in its entirety, said changes taking place now before 
legislation has even been passed are "chaotic and poorly co-ordinated".

Groups of GPs have been told they must form groups to determine how the 
NHS budget is spent but, according to the BMA, they are being told they 
are too small.

Dr Hamish Meldrum, chairman of the BMA, said: 'There has been a growing 
level of unease about how the reforms are panning out - we hear repeated
concerns from doctors about mounting chaos on the ground.

'For example, clinical commissioning groups (CCGs), that had initially 
been told they'd have freedom to form to suit their local communities, 
are now being told they're too small and have to re-form.

'People are still unclear how primary care will be managed as we don't 
yet know where staff currently working in primary care trust 'clusters' 
will eventually be based or if they'll have jobs at all.

'Even at this stage, there are still unanswered questions about what 
statutory functions some bodies will have, making planning very 
difficult.

'Guidance is being issued that is overly restrictive and more and more 
bureaucracy is being created to try to deal with issues which should 
have been dealt with at the beginning.

'A huge amount of time, energy, money and commitment has been wasted because of a lack of a clear plan from the outset.' 

The sixty indicators will replace 
the former target-led system and will include a focus on improving 
cancer survival and a zero-tolerance approach to hospital-acquired 
infections such as MRSA.

The plans are designed to ensure patients are treated with dignity by measuring the ‘responsiveness’ of staff to patient needs.

They aim to improve women’s and 
families’ experiences of maternity services, increase the number of 
people who can access an NHS dentist and help older people recover 
independence after illness.

Under the plans, fewer people with 
long-term conditions like asthma and diabetes will be treated in 
hospitals, and patients undergoing hip and knee operations will receive 
better care.

An indicator on carers who look after sick and elderly relatives is also included.

Mr Lansley said: ‘We have to clear the decks and be clear this is what we are focusing on.

‘People say in three and a half years’
time, in 2015, at the next election, how will we know whether you’ve 
succeeded or not? The answer is, “Have the outcomes improved?”

‘It will be my failure if we haven’t 
improved them and the NHS should feel that it has not succeeded, that is
what we are setting out to do.’

The Government will publish details of
the current performance for each of the sixty benchmarks next week. 
National targets from improvement will then be set out by the time of 
the next election.

Today, the Government will publish for
the first time data comparing patients' experiences at individual GPs' 
surgeries, including recovery times.

It is hoped that revealing the 
information will force up standards by allowing patients to choose to 
avoid poorly performing doctors or institutions.

Where performance falls below minimum 
requirements the NHS Commissioning Board and Care Quality Commission 
will intervene to drive up quality, although how this will work in 
practice is unclear.

The aim of the plan is also to move away from a focus on targets, such as those for waiting times introduced under Labour.

However, patients will still have the 
right to prompt treatment within 18 weeks of referral by their GP as set
out in the NHS Constitution.

Held to account: Nurses and other NHS staff will be judged against nearly 60 tough new goals designed to save more than 20,000 lives a year

Mr Lansley hopes the framework will 
also provide reassurance to parliamentarians about the accountability of
the Health Secretary for the NHS.

There have been concerns that the 
Health and Social Care Bill, currently going through the Lords, 
dramatically weakens accountability of the secretary of state.

Mr Lansley also hopes the plan will 
provide a much greater level of NHS accountability by allowing better 
comparison with other health systems around the world.

The NHS has been criticised for lagging behind other countries in areas such as cancer survival.

Ministers will be expected hold the 
health service to account on delivering increasing improvements across 
all areas in the new framework.

Where performance falls below minimum 
requirements they will intervene to drive up quality, although how this 
will work in practice is as yet unclear.

The framework will also draw on 
existing information collected about the NHS to reduce the potential for
'administrative burden'.
