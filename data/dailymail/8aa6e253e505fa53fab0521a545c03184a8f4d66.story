An ICM poll put Alex Salmond's pro-independence campaigners on 54% 

Last night’s polls only serve to underline how the independence vote remains on a knife-edge.

An ICM poll put Alex Salmond’s pro-independence campaigners on 54 per cent with the No camp trailing way behind on 46.

Two other polls gave the No camp a clear lead and yet another suggested that the fight was heading for a dead heat.

Yesterday’s ICM poll – giving the Yes vote one of its highest-ratings yet – sent a chill through the keep-the-Union camp and cooled hopes that the No campaign was finally pulling ahead.

However, polling expert John Curtice immediately gave the ICM verdict a ‘substantial health warning’, saying it was based on a smaller-than-usual sample of 705 people and was potentially more ‘vulnerable’ to error.

On a day of rapidly-changing fortunes, the Better Together campaign was celebrating after a Survation survey produced 54-46 result in favour of No voters.

Later, a second poll called it for the Yes camp, with an eight-point lead.

But then an Opinium/Observer survey had the pro-Union camp six points ahead on 53 per cent compared to the Yes lobby’s 47.

Surprisingly, it claimed that last week’s surprise offer of a raft of new devo-max powers – unveiled after a YouGov poll last weekend put Yes in the lead – seemed to have had little impact on how people intended to vote.

But before the No camp could relax, the fourth and final poll published yesterday put the rival camps at almost neck and neck.

The Panelbase survey, for the Sunday Times, had Yes on 49.4 per cent and No on 50.6 per cent.

Last night, polling experts insisted the final result in four days’ time was still too close to call.
