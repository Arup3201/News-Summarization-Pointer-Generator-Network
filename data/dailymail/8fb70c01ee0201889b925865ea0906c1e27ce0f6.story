The youngest daughter of the crazed Florida father who shot and killed two of his three children last week only survived because her older sister acted as a human shield.

Lauren Mohney, nine, is currently in a stable condition only because her sister, Savanna Mohney, 14, put herself in the way of her father, David Mohney's bullets during his shooting spree at the family home in Port Orange.

When officers responded to the home they found the girls mother, Cynthia Mohney, 48, curled up between her two daughters and the estranged couple's son, David dead in his bed.

Court filings showed David Mohney wanted to leave his wife and move with daughter Savanna (pictured) and her siblings to South Dakota

'We believe Savanna was coming down the stairs because she suspected something bad had happened (to her brother),' said state attorney Zachary Stoumbos to the Journal Online.

'But then changed her mind and went to her younger sister's bedroom to protect her.'

Stoumbus said he belives Savanna's selfless actions saved her younger sister from their crazed father, who locked his wife out of the house after telling her he was going to kill their children because she wanted a divorce.

'Savanna was draped over Lauren,' said Stoumbos.

'We believe that because she protected her little sister, Lauren's injuries were not as bad.'

The nine-year-old is currently in a coma at the Arnold Palmer Hospital in Orlando. Her mother has not left her side.

According to Cynthia Mohney's lawyer, David Mohney told her on the morning of the murders, 'If you don't come back to me and stop the divorce, I will kill our children.'

The retired Army sergeant then reportedly punched her in the mouth at their Port Orange, Florida, home, and added, 'If you’re going to take my kids away, you will not have them and you will go through the rest of your life without children.' 

Killer and a coward: David (above) killed himself after killing his children

Zachary Stoumbos, the attorney for grieving mother Cynthia, says her husband woke her up early that morning saying that something was wrong with their son, before taking her to the kitchen and showing that he had a gun.

'He continued to tell her, "You will be back with me," and, "This divorce was going to stop,"' Stoumbos told WFTV.

Then, when Cynthia ran to get help, she heard shots fired while at a neighbor's home.

She immediately ran back to the house and was found lying between her two daughter when authorities arrived. 

'His hate took over his love for his children,' added Stoumbos. 

'I can't imagine that level of evil, that level of hate.'

David had claimed his wife Cynthia was a violent, abusive alcoholic in court papers filed just two months before he gunned down his children Friday in their quiet, middle-class neighborhood just south of Daytona Beach.

However, neighbors said both parents were troubled. In a 911 call before the shooting, a neighbor told a dispatcher that neither parent should have had children because they were 'a little bit selfish and self-centered' and said 'you can't believe either one of them.'  

He had recently finished chiropractic school while she supported the family working as a physician's assistant, making $220,000.

Nearly a month after he filed for divorce, the husband sought a protective injunction against his wife June 3. He said in court papers his wife had been drinking heavily and slapping him and their children on their chests, backs and arms. Florida's child welfare agency said Cynthia had recently been treated for substance abuse. 

The slain children were 11-year-old David Mohney and 14-year-old Savanna Mohney, Volusia County Sheriff Ben Johnson said. 

Nine-year-old Lauren Mohney was also was shot and in stable condition at a hospital. Cynthia  wasn't injured.

'If he wants to commit suicide, let him commit suicide. To shoot the children, that's cowardly,' Johnson said at a news conference outside the family's home.

Deputies received a call at 5:11am Friday. Arriving deputies found the two girls in an upstairs bedroom and the boy in a bedroom on the first floor. Their father was in the kitchen with a handgun next to him.

Little guy: Young David was pronounced dead on the scene

In his divorce filing, David said his family moved to Florida in 2010 so he could study at Palmer College of Chiropractic's campus in Port Orange. He graduated in September 2013, but failed his first time taking the board exam and hoped to try again soon.

He said in the court papers that returning to Rapid City, South Dakota, had been his family's plan all along, but his wife had become opposed to it.

He said his children also wanted to make the 1,900-mile move to get relief from their allergies and because they found the Midwest region better suited their 'morals and values.'

David Mohney said he and his children also 'prefer living in a climate with snow to celebrate Christmas and other holidays.'

When he filed for divorce, David Mohney said little about problems with his wife. He made more specific accusations when he asked a Volusia County court for a protective injunction June 3.

In that filing, David Mohney cited four instances between April 4 and May 29 in which he said his wife had slapped one or more of their children.

He said his wife would hit the children — sometimes several times — for arguing with each other, talking back to her, or for not picking up their toys and clothes when she told them to.

'The "hits" described in the examples are loud and hard, beyond corporal punishment,' David Mohney wrote. 'My children were crying, afraid and trying to duck or get away from Cynthia.'

However, he dismissed the request for protection two weeks after filing it.

The state's child abuse hotline was notified in June that Cynthia Mohney had a substance abuse problem after an incident at a restaurant. Cynthia Mohney followed through on treatment, according to the Department of Children and Families.
