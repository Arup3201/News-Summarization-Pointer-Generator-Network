Chris Eubank Jr says Dmitry Chudinov knows he has an 'insurmountable' task on his hands when the two meet for the WBA World Middleweight championship on Saturday, February 28.

The Brighton-born boxer met the Russian hitman for the first time on Monday and was glad to finally look into his opponents eyes.

Eubank Jnr. aims to rebound from his sole career defeat to Billy Joe Saunders last November by defeating the Chudinov, who is also unbeaten, at the O2 Arena and a victory could see him get a rematch with the Hatfield ace.

'On paper he's the Interim World Champion and the man I must beat to get the belt,' Eubank Jr said. 'But having seen him face-to-face and looked him deep in the eyes, I see a man who is up against insurmountable odds,'

'I think for once in a fight the roles are reversed and I'm coming in the good guy and he's coming in the bad guy, I just want my country to be behind me and I can't wait for the day I fight in an opponents backyard,'

'This is now all about me and getting to where I should be. I know that beating Chudinov and getting the title it will open doors for me and one of them could be a rematch Saunders,'

Chudinov is the WBA middleweight champion and says he will return to Russia as a hero if he wins

Chudinov, though, believes he will defeat the son of the British great and return to his homeland a hero.

'This is a fantastic opportunity for me to defeat the son of one of the greats of world boxing,'

'Every in Russia knows of Chris Eubank, by beating his son it will turn me into a national hero and then I can go and get the super-fights against Golovkin,'

'Eubank talks a lot, I am a man of few words and I do all my talking in the ring and come February 28th, I will do all the talking with my fists,'

'In my last fight I boxed in front of over 100,000 people in Russia, coming to London will have no worries for me.'
