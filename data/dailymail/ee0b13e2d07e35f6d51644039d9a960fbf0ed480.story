Lying helpless on the ground of a dirty paddy field, these elephants are the latest victims of the brutal ivory trade.

The elephants were discovered by an Indian forest official in a field in Kokilamari in Shivasagar, India.

In a savage attack, thought to have been carried out by poachers, the animals' tusks were removed after being poisoned.

India's location and array of wildlife makes it particularly susceptible to poachers who can easily export the goods.

Because the price of ‘blood ivory’ - illegally poached tusks – is spiralling, poaching gangs are developing fresh techniques to slaughter animals in huge numbers, such as food poisoning.

The demand for ivory, also referred to as white-gold, is at its highest in China, where it is used in decorations and in traditional medicines, fueling a multi-billion-pound illicit trade.

Sacred but exploited, the Asian elephant has been worshipped for centuries and is still used today for ceremonial and religious purposes. 

Not only is it revered for its role within Asian culture and religion, it is also a key biological species in the tropical forests of Asia.

But the animal is now threatened by extinction in the wild and the country's wild elephant population was recently estimated at about 26,000. 

This is despite an on going operation  in the Karbi Anglong hills, in which several poachers have been arrested.

High profile figures, including Prince William and Hillary Clinton have also unveiled plans to target elephant poaching.

In February, Prince William launched United For Wildlife, a coalition of seven organisations including the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and London Zoo, which aims to end the illegal wildlife trade.

And in September last year, Hilary Clinton put forward a £50million plan to tackle poaching.  

Rhinos are also highly prized and in India's Kaziranga National Park, rhinos had their horns removed while still alive, before bleeding to death. 

The horns are highly sought after in Asia, where they are used in traditional medicines.
