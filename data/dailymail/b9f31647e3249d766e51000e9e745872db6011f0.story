A science fan who made explosive devices after being inspired by the hit television show Brainiac has been jailed for six months after leaving a bomb in his garden shed for seven years.

Michael Thomas, 40, was part of a group of friends who made six pipe bombs before taking them to a remote quarry in Corsham, Wiltshire, to detonate in 2006.

One of the devices was blown up inside a microwave in a re-enactment of an experiment on the popular Sky One show, which has been presented by Richard Hammond and comedian Vic Reeves.

However, the group forgot to detonate one of the pipe bombs and it was unwittingly carried home in a sports bag by Thomas, who placed it in his garden shed following the outing.

Michael Thomas, 40, was jailed for six months at Bristol Crown Court after admitting making an explosive substance. An unexploded pipe bomb made by the father of two was found in his shed in August last year

Thomas had made the devices with friends after being inspired by hit television show Brainiac. However, he mistakenly left one pipe bomb in his garden shed (above) which caused a street evacuation when it was found

Bristol Crown Court heard how the device was eventually discovered by Thomas' ex-wife - who he separated from  in 2010 - after she decided to clear out the shed on August 17 last year.

Police were called when the woman, who was not named in court proceedings, spotted a copper pipe and green cord poking out from the sports bag.

Eighty homes close to the shed, described as being in a ‘built-up area’ in Warmley, Bristol, were evacuated for five hours while an Army bomb disposal squad used a robotic device to examine the bag.

It was then taken to a remote location nearby and safely detonated, while concerned residents took shelter in a nearby supermarket.

Thomas, who is now in a new relationship and the father of two young children, was arrested and admitted a charge of making an explosive substance.

Judge Michael Roach told the stock controller that those ‘reckless enough’ to build such devices - despite not having a sinister motive - should go to prison.

‘The consequence of that discovery were sufficient not only to excite the police but also the bomb squad,’ the judge said.

The father of two had taken the pipe bombs in a sports bag to a quarry in Corsham, Wiltshire for detonating but unwittingly left one in the bag. After putting it in his shed  in 2006, the bomb was discovered seven years later

Police and an Army bomb disposal unit were sent to the house formerly occupied by Thomas in Warmley, Bristol, (above) in August last year when his ex-wife discovered the unexploded device in the garden shed

‘A street had to be evacuated and people had to be looked after at a nearby supermarket. There’s no doubt at all that this is a serious offence. On any view you were enormously reckless.

‘I accept that there was no sinister purpose of that device but the potential for it being on a street, unguarded, available in a residential area makes it obvious that the risks were significant.

‘I can’t ignore those risks.’

Nicholas O’Brien, prosecuting, said Thomas lived with his ex-wife in Bristol until 2010 when the couple separated.

‘In August 2013 his wife decided to clear out the shed where she needed some space,’ Mr O’Brien said.

‘She found a sports bag and having opened it she saw a number of pellets and a copper pipe, with green cord poking out the end.’

Thomas was arrested on August 18 last year and officers who searched his computer discovered material relating to making explosives, Mr O’Brien added.

The court heard how the group made the explosive devices and blew them up in a quarry in a re-enactment of an experiment on the popular Sky One show Brainiac, which has been presented by Richard Hammond (above)

‘It is serious and dangerous but really it seems to be a rather juvenile, amateur interest in explosives,’ he said.

Sam Jones, defending, said Thomas - who has since moved to Bridgwater, Somerset - was a hard-working family man with two children, aged two and 10 months.

Mr Jones said Thomas made the devices with a group of friends, before taking them to a quarry in Corsham to detonate.

‘One was set off inside a microwave, inspired by a programme called Brainiac,’ Mr Jones said.

‘At the end of the programme, which focused on science, various experiments were carried out in things like microwaves. It was used in an educational way.

‘That was really the catalyst for what followed.’

Mr Jones said one of the devices made a ‘loud bang’ when it was blown up, but the others simply fizzed and smoked.

Thomas, who wore a smart black suit for today’s hearing, was jailed for six months for the offence.

As he was led to the cells, the judge told him: ‘What a sad day for your family.’
