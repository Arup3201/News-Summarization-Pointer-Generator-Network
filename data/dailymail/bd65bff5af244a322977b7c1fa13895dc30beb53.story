The stunning home of SASS & Bide co-founder Sarah-Jane Clarke and husband landscape architect Daniel Baffsky has been put up for sale and it can be yours for a cool $6 million.

Clarke, who with Heidi Middleton left the Sass & Bide brand they co-founded last July, is reportedly hoping to buy premises closer to the waterfront once she sells the 718-square-metre property at 34 Derby St.

The house will go under the hammer on February 26. An early-stage price guide of more than $6 million has been offered by real estate agency Ray White Double Bay.

The stunning home of SASS & Bide co-founder Sarah-Jane Clarke and husband landscape architect Daniel Baffsky has been put up for sale and it can be yours for a cool $6 million

It last traded a decade ago for $3.5 million but has been transformed since with its lush gardens a major selling point of the four-bedroom home as well as its stunning harbour views.

The Wentworth Courier gave full details of the scale of the luxury within. Behind a screening front wall there is verdant greenery throughout the front yard, so much so that a large family-size pool is barely visible but tucked away behind the leaves.

Reportedly the walk-in wardrobe alone is worthy of a leading Australian fashion designer. A further three bedrooms on this floor are spacious. Living and chilling zones are also here.

An entry hall opens on to the garden when the floor-to-ceiling windows are drawn back. Generous eaves on the house and adjoining veranda keep the interior protected.

The home has been described as having a relaxed feel throughout. A central living, dining and kitchen dominates the ground floor and is the perfect place to kick back, the Wentworth Courier said.

In what would be a special feature in any home, all three zones within the house take in briliant views of the harbour from the bridge to Watsons Bay through floor-to-ceiling windows.

There is also plenty of space for entertaining on a wide veranda with a great view that also has one very well positioned hammock. In the upper level are the four bedrooms including a master bedroom

Situated in the northeast corner of the home the large bedroom and open-plan bathroom with stand-alone tub take in the incredible harbour views.
