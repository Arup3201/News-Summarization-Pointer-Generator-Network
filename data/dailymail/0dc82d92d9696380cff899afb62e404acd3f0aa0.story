The Cup Trust was granted charitable status - a move approved by the regulator's controversial then-chairman Dame Suzi Leather

The Charity Commission was accused of ‘unacceptable’ and ‘damaging’ failures yesterday for allowing a huge tax avoidance scam to masquerade as a children’s charity.

The Cup Trust was granted charitable status – a move approved by the regulator’s controversial then-chairman Dame Suzi Leather – despite a lack of checks, MPs said.

Its decision was made even though the trust was set up in the British Virgin Islands by a company whose directors were known tax avoidance specialists.

The affair was the ‘tip of the iceberg’ of fake charities exploiting charity tax law, the Public Accounts Committee said.

MPs condemned the commission, which now faces a fresh investigation, for ‘lack of rigour’ in policing rogue organisations over the past 25 years.

Their report follows a series of political rows over the commission’s priorities following Dame Suzi’s appointment in 2006.

The 57-year-old Labour Party member was handed 13 prominent quango jobs after Tony Blair’s 1997 election victory.

The Charity Commission role, which she quit last summer, paid £80,000 for a three-day week.

The Cup Trust applied for charitable status in 2009. But it was a front for a £176million tax avoidance scam which the Charity Commission did not begin investigating until a year later.

The trust spent only £55,000 on charitable causes but tried to claim £46million in charity tax relief.

MPs said that it was ‘unacceptable’ that the Cup Trust was ever registered as a charity. ‘My committee does not believe the Cup Trust ever met the legal criteria to qualify as a registered charity,’ said committee chairman Margaret Hodge.

‘Its purpose was to avoid UK tax.

‘The trust’s true purpose might have been easily detected by the Charity Commission had they carried out more checks before registration, including with HM Revenue & Customs.’

The scandal had damaged the reputation of the commission and the charity sector, she said.

‘It was only after it had registered the trust as a new charity that the commission found out that it had been set up by people active in tax avoidance schemes.

The commission has investigated but a year later its findings have not been published.’

The Charity Commission said last night: ‘We regularly share information with HM Revenue  & Customs. We are discussing  better ways to work together to tackle abuse of charity.

‘We are targeting our resources on the areas of highest risk, with a particular emphasis on tackling fraud, terrorist abuse and risks to vulnerable beneficiaries.

‘We have strengthened our board with new members with considerable experience of regulation in such areas.’

The Cup Trust was launched by tax avoidance expert Matthew Jenner, who in the past has numbered comedian Jimmy Carr, former Radio 1 DJ Chris Moyles and Coronation Street star William Roache among the associates of his companies.

Mr Jenner’s interests have also included pawnbroking and debt collection agencies, and used car businesses.

The Trust has operated by borrowing large sums from banks and using the money to buy gilts, government bonds which attract no capital gains tax or stamp duty when traded.

The gilts are then sold to wealthy investors for a tiny token sum.

The investors sell the gilts on the open market for the proper price.

They then give the proceeds back to the charity, which takes six per cent in fees. The money is used to pay back the Trust’s bank borrowings.

Investors can then claim Gift Aid, which can amount to between £250,000 and £375,000 in tax relief for every million ‘donated’ to the charity.

Dame Suzi, 57, who was made Dame in 2006, is a Labour party member who was handed a series of prominent quango jobs after Labour’s 1997 election victory.

She quit as chairman of the Charity Commission last summer.

The job, which paid £80,000 for a three-day week, was one of three quango posts and three posts on committees running state institutions which she held last year.

She has since 1997 run or been a member of 13 quangos and boards, alongside a post as Deputy Lieutenant of Devon.

Her replacement at the Commission, William Shawcross, has also come under criticism from MPs, in particular for the Commission’s decision to ban a Plymouth Brethren church from charity status on the grounds that it did not do enough for the public good.

The Charity Commission said yesterday that it has opened an inquiry into an organisation called The Public Safety Charitable Trust.

The body rented 1,500 empty buildings at peppercorn rents and installed wi-fi transmitters to broadcast public safety messages. Landlords then claimed they did not need to pay business rates because the buildings were used for charitable purposes.

Three councils who said the charity was a tax avoidance scheme won a High Court case allowing them to recover tax last month.
