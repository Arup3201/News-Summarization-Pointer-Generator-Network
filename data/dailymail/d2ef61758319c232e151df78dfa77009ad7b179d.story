Jack Bruce, the composer, singer and multi-instrumentalist, most famous for being part of 1960s group Cream has died aged 71. 

Bassist Bruce, who was part of the group with guitarist Eric Clapton and drummer Ginger Baker, passed away at his home in Suffolk today, surrounded by his family.

His family said: 'It is with great sadness that we, Jack's family, announce the passing of our beloved Jack: husband, father, granddad, and all round legend. The world of music will be a poorer place without him but he lives on in his music and forever in our hearts.'

Bruce's death was announced on his official website, and confirmed by his publicist Claire Singers. 

Cream sold 35 million albums in just over two years and were awarded the world's first ever platinum disc for their LP Wheels of Fire.

Bruce wrote and sang most of the songs, including 'I Feel Free', 'White Room', 'Politician' and perhaps the world's most performed guitar riff, in 'Sunshine Of Your Love'.

Cream split in November 1968 at the height of their popularity. Bruce felt that he had strayed too far from his ideals and wanted to re-discover his musical and social roots.

Many artists covered Bruce's songs, from Jimi Hendrix, to David Bowie and Ella Fitzgerald.

Bruce, born in Glasgow on May 14, 1943, joined his first major band in London in 1962. This was Alexis Korner's Blues Inc. with whom Charlie Watts, later to join the Rolling Stones, was drummer.

Bruce left Korner in 1963 to form a group with organist Graham Bond, guitarist John McLaughlin and drummer Ginger Baker. This group became the seminal Graham Bond Organisation after McLaughlin left, and saxophonist Dick Heckstall-Smith joined. Bruce was compelled to leave this band after three years by Baker, who said his playing was 'too busy'.

Bruce joined John Mayall's Blues Breakers, where he first met Clapton, followed by Manfred Mann in an ill-advised attempt at commercialism.

It was Baker who initially asked Bruce to form a trio with Clapton, who insisted that Bruce would be the singer.

After Cream broke up, Bruce began recording solo albums, the first being his influential Songs For A Tailor and thereafter began his policy of playing simultaneously in rock, jazz and classical formats.

He also worked as session man on carefully chosen dates with such stars as Lou Reed and Frank Zappa, with whom Jack co-wrote Apostrophe, which became Zappa's biggest selling album.

In 2005, Bruce reunited with Clapton and Baker for Cream's first concert tour in 37 years. And in May the band played four historic nights at London's Royal Albert Hall, which were recorded and subsequently released on both audio and video. In October the band played three concerts at Madison Square Garden in New York City.

Bruce and his wife Margrit were hoping to retire to their beautiful estancia in Majorca.
