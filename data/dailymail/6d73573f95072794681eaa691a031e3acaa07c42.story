A honeymoon ended in tragedy after a husband was killed in a horrific car crash and his wife critically injured near a popular tourist spot in New Zealand.

Kirsten Steinke, 28, and 31-year-old Kenneth Kallan Stithem had married just four days ago in the U.S. and were visiting the Waitomo Caves when their car collided with a truck on Thursday morning.

Police inspector Leo Tooman said the car in which the couple were traveling collided with a truck at an intersection while overtaking.

Tragedy: Newlywed Kenneth Kallan Stithem died in a horrific car crash in Waitomo, New Zealand and his wife Kirsten Steinke left critically injured. The couple had been married just four days

Fatal collision: A 31-year-old man from New Jersey was killed and his 28-year-old wife of four days was critically injured after their car smashed into a truck in New Zealand

The fatal crash took place at 9.20am 
local time at the intersection of Waitomo Caves Road and State Highway 3
when the newlyweds' vehicle slammed into a truck carrying concrete after 
overtaking a stationary green vehicle.

Firefighters had to cut the victims free from the mangled red car. The young wife was flown to Waikoto Hospital but her husband died from his injuries. 

Ms Steinke, from Colorado, works as a marketing and communications co-ordinator at the University of Colorado Foundation.

The couple were believed to have spent the previous day river rafting and eating at a local restaurant.

Accident: Police say the couple failed to yield at an intersection near the Waitomo Caves, colliding with a concrete truck

Locals said the intersection where the
crash occurred is a notorious accident hotspot, with several 
collisions happening every year, according to a report in the Waikato Times.

The Waikoto network of caves attracts 
thousands of tourists each year who come to see the glowworms.

Inspector Tooman called the accident an 'absolute tragedy.'

'My heart goes out to the family and friends of the couple,' he said.

U.S. embassy spokesman David Edginton 
expressed deepest condolences to the couple's family and friends. 
He said consular officers from Auckland were in contact with the 
families and were providing assistance.

Another American tourist died at the same intersection in February.  Five
per cent of crashes in the region last year involved foreign tourists, 
according to statistics collected by the Regional Transport Committee 
and cited by Waikato Times. In total, 64 people died on Waikato roads in
2011.

In May, a 20-year-old woman from Manalapan, New Jersey, was among three people killed in a minivan crash near the town of Turangi, in the central part of the country's North Island and about 100 miles southeast of Thursday's accident.

Daniela Rosanna Lekhno, a junior at Boston University who was spending a semester abroad, was on her way to hike in Tongariro National Park, when the driver of the van she and at least seven others were riding in lost control, veered off the road and crashed, according to local police.
