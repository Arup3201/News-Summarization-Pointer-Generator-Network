Fusilier Lee Rigby was brutally murdered in 2013 

A council has decided not to name a memorial at the site of Lee Rigby's death after the murdered fusilier for fear it may offend Islamic fanatics. 

Campaigners urged Greenwich Council to build a commemorative site for the man who was murdered by two extremists in the street last year.

But after agreeing to their demands, officials revealed it would not be named after the 25-year-old for fear it could lead to more religious attacks.

Instead, an inscription will read: 'To commemorate all those servicemen and woman who have served or lived in Woolwich and who gave given their lives.'

Critics blasted the decision as 'disgusting' last night, urging officials to 'stand up' to violent extremists. 

'It's disgusting. People outraged by that day need somewhere to go to think about what happened to Lee and his family,' Cheryl Spruce told the Sun. 

Lorna Taylor, another campaigner, added: 'The council has feared a Lee Rigby memorial will be attacked. But there will always be extremists and we need to stand up to them.'  

Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale were jailed for a minimum of 45 years each for butchering Mr Rigby, a father, in Woolwich as he walked on the street in military uniform. 

Together they knocked the 25-year-old down in the street then hacked at his body with knives to the horror of by-passers. 

During an Old Bailey trial the pair spoke of their devotion to Islam and their fight against the west which they said drove them to commit such a heinous crime. 

The murder sent shock waves across the country and became synonymous with the ongoing struggle against Islamist fanatics. 

Rebecca Rigby, the widow of Lee Rigby, lays a wreath near the site where he was killed outside Woolwich Barracks in May 2013

A campaign to commemorate the fusilier with a memorial site outside Woolwich Barracks was launched and taken under immediate consideration by Greenwich Council officials. 

It was revealed a stone would be placed at nearby St George's Chapel, but that it would not be dedicated specifically to the soldier. 

Mr Rigby's family welcomed the location of the memorial, with his widow Rebecca saying: 'I know St George's Chapel and it is a peaceful place and I think the memorial proposals will be fitting.'

His mother Lyn added: 'I support the council's plans and will feel able to visit the memorial in the chapel.'

Earlier this year Fusilier Rigby's son, Jack, placed a poppy wreath at the National Memorial Arboretum where his father's name has been engraved.
