Every day pot tourists who visited Colorado to partake in the state's new legal marijuana fly out of Denver airport. And ever day, dozens of them leave behind the drugs they did not have time to smoke.

Rental cars at Denver International Airport have become a dumping ground for marijuana. Workers say they find stashes in returned cars every day.

Some pot tourists are even offering to 'tip' rental car workers in drugs.

Workers told KCNC-TV that they find the new trend aggravating. And just because the state has made marijuana legal, tourists shouldn't assume everyone smokes it.

'I just throw it away, I'm like, "I don't need it,"' one rental car worker said.

It may be legal to get high in Colorado, but it's not legal to do it while flying high. Marijuana is banned at Denver International Airport, punishable by a $999 fine. Signs at entrances make it clear that the drugs aren't welcome there.

The airport bans pot because federal law still classifies it as an illegal substance. Additionally, 48 other states (all except Washington) have laws against the recreational use of marijuana. Airport officials say the rules also help to stop the illegal transportation of marijuana across state lines.

But many preoccupied pot tourists have plenty of drugs leftover when it's time to leave the Rocky Mountain State. So they leave it in their rental cars.

One airport rental car employee told KCNC that she finds drugs four times a day in returned vehicles.

Another said the problem seemed to especially spike during the July Fourth holiday - when apparently lots of tourists were celebrating the birth of the nation by getting stoned.

All the employees KCNC talked to said they either throw away the marijuana or hand it over to a supervisor.

'We try not to let it get to the car wash bay because those guys will take it,' one employee added.
