The Islamic State is working to inspire sympathizers inside the U.S. to target and kill American servicemen at home, according to new intelligence.

Fearing an attack like the one carried out by an ISIS-supporter on Canada's parliament two months ago, which resulted in the death of a uniformed soldier, U.S. officials are asking servicemen to scrub their social media accounts of anything that might identify them as a member of the military.

The FBI and [Department of Homeland Security] recommend that current and former members of the military review their online social media accounts for any information that might serve to attract the attention of ISIL [ISIS] and its supporters,' the joint memo obtained by ABC News said.

New threat: American servicemen are being warned to scrub their social media accounts out of fear that ISIS supporters in the U.S. may use sites like Facebook and Twitter to identify them for attacks on the homeland.

The bulletin was issued to law enforcement agencies on Sunday and advised troops to 'routinely exercise operational security in their interactions online' as the recent attack on Canada may 'embolden' and 'motivate' others loyal to ISIS in the U.S. 

Members of the American special operations forces and other military branches told ABC that they deactivated, scrubbed or locked their Facebook and other social media accounts before the U.S. started leading a coalition to bomb ISIS in Iraq and Syria in August. 

But according to the latest memo, the strongest warning issued by the FBI to U.S. military yet, fresh intelligence suggests that ISIS is revamping efforts to target the homeland. 

'The FBI recently received reporting indicating individuals overseas are spotting and assessing like-minded individuals who are willing and capable of conducting attacks against current and former U.S.-based members of the United States military,' the bulletin added. 

Copycat? Fresh intelligence suggests ISIS is looking to inspire copycat attacks like the one on Canada's parliament in October. Above, bystanders tend to a fallen soldier in the attack

A day before the U.S. carried out it's largest bombing raid on ISIS in September, the terrorist group's spokesman issued a chilling statement asking supporters in the U.S. and Europe to kill any 'disbelievers' whether they be soldiers or civilians. 

'Do not ask for anyone's advice and do not seek anyone's verdict,' ISIS spokesman Abu Mohammad al-Adnani said in an audio speech posted online on September 21. 'Kill the disbeliever whether he is civilian or military, for they have the same ruling. Both of them are disbelievers. Both of them are  considered to be waging war.' 

Social media has been perhaps one of ISIS's biggest tools, aiding in the terrorist's groups expansion in Syria and into Iraq. 

Several sympathetic Westerners have used sites like Facebook and Twitter to contact fighters in the Middle East, and many have been persuaded to travel to Turkey and cross the border to join the jihad.
