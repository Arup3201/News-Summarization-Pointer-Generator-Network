New concrete posts along a suburban Pittsburgh, PA., road have gotten a rise out of locals.

Meant to protect citizens from out of control cars, the bollards’ long bases and round tops are quickly becoming the butt of jokes around the small town.

‘People are laughing at it. They're calling it Penis Road," Scott, PA, resident Pat Martin told township commissioners during a Tuesday community meeting, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazzette.

Despite town manager Denise Fitzgerald saying the bollards were approved by the state Department of Transportation, other town officials called for a change.

Having not seen the controversial posts prior to installation, Commissioner Eileen Meyers called for ‘something more antique,’ adding, ‘I think they're too modern for that area.’

Another town commissioner asked if they could be flattened, arguing it would improve their appearance.

Not all town officials agreed with the sentiment.

One said those in opposition of the unique posts have ‘weird minds,’ another said ‘people need to get their minds out of the gutters.’

Not all opposition stemmed to the bollards stemmed from their suggestive appearance, one local resident had something else on his mind.

‘I think those posts are too far apart. I think a small car like a Volkswagen could get through.’

City officials have said they will look into the cost of flattening the bollards’ tops.
