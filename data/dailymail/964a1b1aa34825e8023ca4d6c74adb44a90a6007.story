When it comes to our love lives it seems that we are a superstitious nation at heart. 

Research has revealed that one in 10 Britons admit to owning a set of 'lucky underwear', with most men and women keeping hold of their blessed briefs for four years, and 16 per cent of people keeping their special pants for over a decade.

According to the study by Mecca Bingo, lucky 
underwear has led to over a third of Brits having sex (35 per cent), and 
almost a quarter (19 per cent) claim to have won money whilst wearing their 
trusted pants. Some Brits were fortunate enough to be proposed to (13 
per cent) and one in four men (27 per cent) say they have witnessed 
their sports team win as a result of wearing their special shorts.

Get lucky: TOWIE star Ferne McCann has been posing in specially created 'lucky pants' in her local bingo hall in Dagenham

To 
celebrate this risque research the bingo company has created a pair of 
shorts for men and briefs for women on sale on a first come first served
 basis for a suggested charity donation of £2.

Fresh
 from her stint on the TOWIE Marbella special, reality star Ferne McCann
 has been drafted in to model the women's lucky pants: black and white 
briefs featuring tiny red hearts.

Posing
 in her local bingo hall in a pair of heels and a cropped T-shirt Ferne 
said: 'It’s fascinating to hear that so many people have lucky 
underwear.

'I’ve never owned a pair of lucky undies so I’m thrilled to finally have a set of my own - I can’t wait to test them out!'

Classic: The survey by Mecca Bingo revealed that most women's lucky knickers are a classic brief style in black or white

When asked
 why they believe their undies are lucky, almost half the nation said it
 was because they felt comfortable in them. But for one third of Brits it is simply because something positive had happened 
whilst wearing them.  

Celebrities such as Katy Perry also seem to be following the trend. According
 to the New York Daily News, the ‘ROAR’ singer bought President Obama 
his own pair of lucky underwear at a political rally in London just 
before he won the 2012 election.

Ant McPartlin claims he hasn't made a live appearance in 25 years without donning his lucky white underwear

And
 here in the UK,  ITV presenter Ant McPartlin claims he hasn’t made a 
live appearance in 25 years without donning his lucky white underwear.

Like Ant, most men aren’t too daring when it comes to what’s down under, with almost 50 per cent wearing boxers in either traditional black (25 per cent) or blue (18 per cent).

When it comes to patterns, vertical stripes came up top, followed by horizontal strips and checkered squares.

Black (23 per cent), red (21 per cent) and white (20 per cent) were the most popular colours amongst the ladies in a ‘classic style’ brief, with almost a quarter (24 per cent) of women slipping them on to increase their chances of getting lucky.

Red hearts came out on top as the most popular ‘lucky’ pattern with 12 per cent of the vote, followed by flowers (10 per cent), polka dots (9 per cent), and stars (8 per cent).

Donna Dawson, a psychologist 
specialising in Personality and Behaviour, explains: 'Lucky undies 
become ‘lucky’ because their owners connect wearing them to positive 
events, and continue to be ‘lucky’ because their owners believe in their
 power.

'Wearing
 the lucky pair becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, as they make people 
feel more comfortable, relaxed and confident, which in turn make them 
better able to recognise and respond to positive opportunities that come
 along.

'Lucky
 items such as underwear give people a sense of power and control over 
their environment, which is really what good luck is all about.'

Katy Perry apparently bought President Obama his own pair of lucky underwear at a rally in London just before he won the 2012 election

A spokesman for Mecca Bingo explains: 'Our customers have all kinds of lucky rituals from jewellery to cuddly toys.

'We know that lucky undies are also a popular choice, so we thought why not find out what the nation’s luckiest pair would look like, and create them and make them available to our customers.'

The money raised will go to the Carers 
Trust which Mecca Bingo supports nationwide. And for those nowhere near 
the Essex region, a limited number will also available via Mecca Bingo’s
 social media channels, where fans are able to try their luck to win a 
pair.
