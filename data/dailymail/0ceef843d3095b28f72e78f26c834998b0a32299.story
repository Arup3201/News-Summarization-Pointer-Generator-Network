A siege ended yesterday with police marksmen shooting dead a man who was holding a knife to his lover’s throat.

He had been keeping the woman hostage after smashing his way into her garden flat.

A hostage negotiator was brought in to try to persuade the 40-year-old knifeman to come out of the basement property.

Crime scene: Armed officers shot a 40-year-old man dead in Shepperton Road (pictured) in Islington after he broke into a house and threatened a woman with a knife

Police had sent a negotiator and armed officers to the scene at 11.19pm yesterday following reports the man had broken into a house

But the talks broke down and, fearing for the woman’s life, the officers opened fire. 

Police and paramedics immediately tried to resuscitate the man but he died 20 minutes later on his way to hospital.

Last night neighbours in Islington, North London, asked why the knifeman could not be Tasered or even overpowered by the dozens of officers at the scene. 

The independent police watchdog is also examining what contact, if any, police had with the couple before the shooting.

A pair of shoes could be seen on a window ledge at the house, which has been surrounded by blue and red police tape

The man and woman involved are believed to have known each other, police said, and there was not believed to be anybody else in the house at the time

The incident unfolded on Shepperton Road in Islington, London, which is lined with pretty Georgian houses

The drama began shortly after 11pm on Thursday when neighbours dialled 999 to report the man had broken into the flat. 

Officers arrived to discover he was armed with a knife and apparently holding the woman hostage inside.

Residents said the street was transformed into a ‘war zone’ with dozens of police cars and specialist marksmen dressed in black and wearing earpieces.

Neighbours heard the woman screaming repeatedly and refusing to allow police inside as the man swore and shouted ‘stop pointing that light at me’ at police.  

The Met's Directorate of Professional Standards were informed of the incident 'immediately' and attended the scene, a police spokesman said

Neighbours said they heard 'four or five' bangs before seeing police vehicles and ambulances descended on the scene

Forensic investigators have been examining the rear of the Georgian terraced property where bandages and first aid wrappers could be seen on the ground

A negotiator was brought in and sat on the garden wall – just yards from the flat’s front window – making contact by telephone.

But the man grew increasingly angry, shouting at police to ‘get the f*** out of here’. Neighbours felt he was drunk or had taken drugs.

At 1am – after a period of relative quiet – a volley of up to five gunshots, ‘like fireworks’, was heard as armed officers stormed inside. Eyewitnesses said stun grenades were used.

City worker Lyssa Barber said: ‘I was woken up to shouts and immediately afterwards to what sounded like four or five bangs. They were gunshots. 

Investigation: The road was cordoned off while the two-hour stand-off unfolded overnight

Deadly force: A number of shots were fired during the incident at around 1am and the 40-year-old knifeman died 20 minutes later while on route to the hospital

 The woman involved in the two-hour siege was not harmed during the ordeal but is being treated for shock. Forensics are continuing to investigate today

‘I heard five gunshots, but a gunshot in real life doesn’t sound like it does on TV. It sounded like loud bangs on a door.’

Another resident said: ‘He sounded angry, his voice was that of someone from the East End. He must have been high on drugs or drink to be so angry.

‘I got up to make a cup of tea and suddenly I heard a gunshot, it was a cracking noise. My boyfriend shouted “get down” and we crouched on the floor.

‘There was a pause then there were three more gunshots. Afterwards I went to the window and I saw smoke billowing.

‘I could see paramedics leading him out the house on a stretcher. They were doing CPR but I could see it wasn’t working, he was already dead.’

The man's next of kin have yet to be informed. Police say he is a 40 year old black man, thought to be born in Islington

The terrified woman was taken away by paramedics wrapped in a bright pink blanket and treated for shock.

She is believed to be a 56-year-old mother-of-two who moved into the local authority flat six months ago. She worked for a tool hire company until recently.

Kenneth Seddon, 82, who has lived in the road for 40 years, said he helped the woman move in.

He said: ‘She has a little Yorkie dog she walks twice a day in the park. I don’t think she was in work. I felt a bit sorry for her. She was a bit vulnerable.’ 

Police have descended on the leafy road, near Islington's fashionable Upper Street

Neighbours said police cordoned off the street last night and were stopping some residents from returning to their homes

Speaking about her boyfriend, he said he often saw them drinking and dancing inside the flat which had recently been refitted by the council.

Yesterday, the scene of the shooting, opposite a large nursery school, remained sealed off for forensic examination.

Commander Neil Basu, of the Met, said the shooting will be investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission and professional standards officers.

‘These events do demonstrate the challenging nature of the work that our firearms officers – and all our officers – have to perform on a daily basis,’ he said.

Scotland Yard confirmed the drama was not caught on body-worn video cameras.

They are being rolled out among firearms officers after the controversy that followed the shooting of gangster Mark Duggan more than three years ago.

Retired Met firearms officer Roger Gray said: ‘They would have been forced to act very, very quickly. Split-second decisions.’
