A Manhattan investment banker has resigned from his $7-million-a-year job after his estranged wife made explosive allegations about cocaine binges and forced group sex during their messy, bitter divorce and custody battle over their two daughters. 

Sage Kelly, who ran the profitable healthcare banking business for Jefferies Group, is stepping down to 'focus on his family,' Bloomberg reports.

The sensational public claims by his estranged wife Christina Kelly led Jefferies Group to drug test the entire healthcare banking department. 

Bitter divorce: Sage Kelly has stepped down from his job - where he reportedly made $7million a year - after the shocking by his estranged wife Christina

The company even made reference to the scandal when releasing its quarterly earnings report on Tuesday - noting that 'unusual publicity' hadn't hurt business, according to Bloomberg. 

Mr Kelly, 42, has been on leave from the company since October when Mrs Kelly made shocking allegations in court documents that he coerced her to have sex with a prospective client after a night of heavy drinking and snorting cocaine.

The raucous account of the night - which has been denied by Mr Kelly, as well as the other executive Mrs Kelly named - includes a drug-addled foursome in which the other executive's girlfriend showed off her new breast implants. The night ended with the Kellys partner swapping with the other executive and Mrs Kelly having sex with the prospective client, she claimed in her lawsuit. 

Mrs Kelly claims she felt coerced into having sex with the other executive that night - and played the dutiful wife in the hopes that it would win her husband a big client.  

Mr and Mrs Kelly agreed last month to share custody of their two daughter and settled the divorce for a massive sum

Mrs Kelly eventually sent out a statement praising her husband as a 'great father' and apologizing for the allegations she made

Mr Kelly had won full custody of the couple's two daughters after he showed a judge hidden camera footage of his wife doing cocaine and argued that she was an unfit parent. 

He also cited her 2010 crash and drunk driving arrest in the Hamptons in which one of the couple's daughters was in the back seat.

That prompted Mrs Kelly, 39, fired back with a series of shocking charges against her husband.

In addition to the alleged group sex, Mrs Kelly claimed that her husband had drug parties with major players from the New York banking world. She alleges he binged on drugs including: Molly, ketamine, magic mushrooms, ecstasy and heroin. 

Mr Kelly denied all allegations his wife made in the divorce proceedings. 

The two settled in November - a month after Mrs Kelly filed the explosive divorce claims - for a massive sum and agreed to split custody of
