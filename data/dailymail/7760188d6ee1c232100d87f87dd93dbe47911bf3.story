Pele has revealed that he is 'doing fine' following reports that the Brazilian icon had been admitted to a special care unit in a Sao Paulo hospital.

The three-time World Cup winner took to Twitter to let fans know that he was 'not put into intenstive care' and is on the road to recovery from a urinary tract infection.

The 74-year-old wrote: 'Hello everyone, I want to take this opportunity to let you know that I am doing fine. 

Brazil legend Pele has been admitted to hospital twice this month, but claims he is 'doing fine'

'I was not put into intensive care today, I was simply relocated to a special room within the hospital for privacy purposes only.

'While I appreciate all the visitors that came to see me, I really need to continue my treatment and recovery in peace.

'I am blessed to receive your love and support, and thank God this is nothing serious.

'I am looking forward to spending the upcoming holidays with my family, and will start the new year with renewed health, with many international trips already planned! Thank you!' 

Pele is now expected to make a 'quick and full' recovery from the minor infection caused by a recent surgery to remove kidney stones, his manager said Thursday.

Paul Kemsley said in a statement sent to The Associated Press that reports about the deterioration of Pele's condition and about him going into intensive care 'were greatly exaggerated.'

'He was relocated to a special area of the hospital for privacy purposes only, due to having an overwhelming number of visitors which prevented him from getting the necessary care and treatment,' he said. 'He is expected to make a quick and full recovery.'

The Albert Einstein hospital released a statement earlier in the day saying the 74-year-old Pele was transferred to a 'special care' unit after his condition became unstable. The statement created a scare in Brazil, with local media widely reporting that Pele's condition had worsened.

'He is fine,' Jose Fornos Rodrigues, Pele's spokesman and personal aide, told the AP. 'The problem was that he was receiving too many visitors and that wasn't helping, so they transferred him to a calmer area to continue receiving the proper treatment. He should be out of the hospital in a few days.'

The hospital later released another statement saying that Pele's condition 'improved,' but for the first time mentioned that he was in 'an intensive care unit' and temporarily undergoing kidney support treatment.

The hospital's press office had previously denied that Pele was in intensive care. Kemsley's statement about Pele's condition came after the hospital's latest report.

'Pele plans to spend the upcoming holidays with his family, and in the new year, he will recommence his busy worldwide schedule,' Kemsley said. 'Trips to Australia, China, Nigeria and Azerbaijan are already confirmed for the early part of 2015.'

Pele, a three-time World Cup winner, successfully underwent surgery to remove kidney stones on Nov. 13. He was admitted to the hospital on Monday for a medical evaluation and was diagnosed with the infection. He was being treated with antibiotics.

He has enjoyed good health in recent years despite needing to undergo surgeries for a hip replacement and a detached retina.

Pele, widely known as the greatest footballer of all time, is a national hero in Brazil. He remains a worldwide ambassador to football and is active with his many businesses across the globe. He still participates in many advertising campaigns and is present at most major football tournaments.

He won the World Cup with Brazil in 1958, '62 and 1970 and is known as the game's most prolific scorer, credited with 1,281 goals in 1,363 career matches.
