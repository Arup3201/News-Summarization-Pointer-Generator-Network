A northern California region marked by towering redwood trees and mountains rising out of the Pacific is the focus of an intensive search for a suspect in the shooting deaths of his wife and two young daughters.

Shane Franklin Miller, considered armed and dangerous, grew up in coastal Humboldt County and authorities say that his ability to fortify himself in an area so remote it's called the "lost coast" makes searchers vulnerable.

'It would be easy to hide out up there,' said local resident Phil Franklin, one of hundreds ordered to lock doors and shelter in place as the manhunt expands.

Wanted: Police are searching for Shane Franklyn Miller, 45, who is wanted in connection to the Tuesday killings of his wife, 34, and two young daughters, aged 4 and 8

Authorities believe the 45-year-old 
Miller has taken refuge somewhere in the area around Petrolia since his 
truck was found nearby on Wednesday.

The bodies of Miller's wife Sandy, 34, 
and two daughters, Shasta, 4, and Shelby, 8, were discovered earlier 
this week at the family's home in Shingletown. Officials would not 
disclose how the victims died.

A
sheriff's investigator said Miller's retreat into the mountainous woods
creates a dangerous situation for officers trying to track him.

'It's almost like warfare,' said Lt. Dave Kent of the Shasta County Sheriff's Office, which is handling the investigation.

To
imagine the ruggedness of the landscape think 'Jurrasic Park' because 
some of the movie was filmed there. Many residents live off the grid on 
unmarked back roads often shrouded in a coastal fog.

Folks in 
this community of 200 miles north of San Francisco have been ordered to 
leave a contact number tacked to their front doors if they evacuate so 
that so law enforcement can verify their safety.

Crime scene: Police are investigating the murder of the mother and two daughters killed at this home on Tuesday night. They are searching for Shane Franklin Miller, named as the main suspect

'We
assume he's still in the valley, but he could have gotten help from 
somebody,' said Franklin who runs the Petrolia Guest House, one of the 
few businesses in a town so-named because the first California oil well 
was drilled there. 'We're all locked down here. We're supposed to call 
911 if we see anything suspicious.'

On Thursday tactical search 
teams from Shasta, Humboldt and Mendocino counties asked for assistance 
from other agencies, including the swat team from Pelican Bay State 
Prison in Crescent City near the Oregon border that is trained in 
apprehending escaped prisoners, said Terry Thornton, spokeswoman for the
state prisons. They were instructed to meet at the incident command 
post, the Petrolia Volunteer Fire Department, at 6 a.m. Friday, she 
said.

Authorities say he is familiar with the tree-lined canyons 
so steep that only one paved, pot-holed road serves the area. They 
suspected he might be heading to a cabin he frequents, but there were no
sightings reported on Thursday.

On the lookout: Shasta County Sheriff's deputies investigate the scene of a triple homicide. Authorities are searching for Shane Franklin Miller who is suspected of fatally shooting his wife and two young daughters at their home

Like Franklin, most of the 
residents are armed because law enforcement patrols are rare in this 
community built on a peninsula that juts into the Pacific.

'The 
county is strapped for money so we don't have police protection out 
here. We all contact each other if something occurs so we can coordinate
help,' Franklin said.

A woman who identified herself as Miller's
mother told the Associated Press on Thursday that she had not 
communicated with her son since the shooting and was unaware of problems
in the marriage.

Miller is familiar to law enforcement. He once 
tried to make a living growing one of the region's biggest cash crops --
marijuana. In 1996 he was convicted of felony cultivation in a county 
known worldwide for the high quality pot grown in the same hard-to-reach
forests authorities now are combing.

Fugitive: Shane Franklin Miller, 45, has been on the loose for more than three days now since the killings on Tuesday in Shingletown, Northern California

In 2002, Miller was charged
in San Francisco with making and selling marijuana for distribution, 
being a felon in possession of a firearm, possessing a machine gun and 
money laundering, according to court records. He pleaded guilty to being
a felon in possession of a gun and was sentenced to three years and 10 
months in prison. He was released in May 2007, according to the federal 
Bureau of Prisons.

He served 46 months in federal prison for being a felon in possession of a firearm, court records show.

He
apparently stayed off the radar of law enforcement until 7:45 p.m. on 
Tuesday, when Shasta County Sheriff's deputies received a call from his 
house. When they arrived, they found the bodies of Miller's wife, Sandy,
34, and two daughters, Shelby, 8, and Shasta, 5.

All three had been shot multiple times, said Lt. Kent.

Kent
said investigators had not determined who placed the call, but he said 
it was from one of the victims as the shooting was in progress.

Authorities
also have not recovered the gun, or guns, believed to have been used in
the shooting, but Kent said more weapons were found in the house.
