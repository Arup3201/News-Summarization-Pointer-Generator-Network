A carpenter looking to build and sell sheds, instead built a home fit for a hobbit. A hobbit that likes its creature comforts.

Randy Jones, a carpenter for 22 years, was researching how best to build small storage buildings out of leftover materials when he came across the tiny house trend that has become so popular and spawned books, blogs and a TV show.

With years of experience building log cabins he was up for a challenge on a different scale.

Tiny houses have to be smaller than 500 square feet but still include all the luxuries of a larger house cleverly tucked away inside.

Randy Jones originally set out to build and sell small storage buildings but came across the popular tiny house trend in his research and decided to base his first project on J.R.R. Tolkien's description of a hobbit home

As described in the classic book 'The Hobbit', hobbit homes have round doors and are sunk into the ground. Jones covered the roof of his tiny home with ivy to create that effect

Jones' first project is located, not in Hobbiton, The Shire, but in Morristown, Tennessee.

Wanting to stand out from the crowd and capture part of the market, an inspired Jones decided that his first effort would be based on the hobbit  houses described in J.R.R. Tolkien's books 'The Hobbit' and 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy.

'You have to compete. Anyone can build a small house that's a carpenter, so you have to do something unique that people don't know how to do,' Jones told the Citizen Tribune.

The 200 square foot home has wood sides, a rounded roof covered in ivy - a nod to the fact that hobbit holes are supposed to be underground - and the famous round door.

Tiny houses require smart design inside, and the hobbit house manages to include a full kitchen with farmer-style sink, a full bathroom, a couch, a bed, dining table, a flat-screen TV, and a washer and dryer.

Jones has been a carpenter for 22 years and was keen to create something unique to grab a share of the market for tiny houses

Inside the hobbit house there is a full kitchen with farmer-style sink, washer, dryer and lots of storage. The house also has a water heater, central heating and air conditioning

The bedroom is separated from the living area by sliding doors and has a twin-size bed that flips out into a queen-size bed to accommodate two

A cozy couch on one side of the living area by the kitchen sits opposite a wall-mounted flat-screen TV. The house has all the creature comforts of a larger home

'We put a few nicer amenities in it to catch the eye; the sink is one of them,' Jones said.

'The bed is a single, but it flips out to a queen. The dining room table flips up and down to save space. There is a water heater, central heat and air and everything is electric.'

Jones has ambitions to build more tiny homes once the hobbit house is sold and is exploring basing new ones on the houses in 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' and 'South Pacific'.

His imagination has no end and he has also begun thinking about building homes on barges and adding solar panels. 

While he aims to continue building unique homes, he will customize them for buyers as requested. 

The movie 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey', starring Martin Freeman (pictured) and directed by Peter Jackson, was released in 2012 and based on the book by J.R.R. Tolkein

Hobbits live in the fictional town of Hobbiton which was recreated for the filming of the movie outside the town of Matamata, New Zealand
