Hackers are using spyware to steal text messages, contacts, pictures and other personal information from iPhones, according to computer security experts.

Anti-virus company Trend Micro claims it has discovered new software that infects iPhones running iOS 7 and iOS8.

The software is spread via phishing attacks that are sent from the phones of friends and associates to encourage targets to click on a link and install the spyware.

The XAgent malware will run on Apple devices like the new iPhone 6 (above) even if they are not jailbroken

Known as XAgent, the spyware will then collect text messages, contact lists, pictures, location data, lists of apps and any software running on the device.

This information is then sent to a remote server while the malware will also switch on the iPhone's microphone and record everything going on around it.

Trend Micro believe the malware has been created by a group of Russian hackers who have in the past been targetting governments, the military and the media.

The XAgent malware is not the first to hack into Apple's iOS software for its mobile devices.

iPhone users were left unaware for approximately a year-and-a half that a software bug could have made them the victims of ‘hi-tech eavesdropping’.

Security experts warned that past iterations of iOS software - dating from as long ago as September 2012 - had a vulnerability that hackers could have exploited to see financial transactions, emails and Facebook activity.

The vulnerability was eventually fixed by an update to the iOS7 software last February.

Hackers also claim to have been able to circumvent the fingerprint recognition hardware installed on the iPhone 5S and iPhone 6.

Some iPhone users reported last May that they received messages telling them their phones had been hacked by Oleg Pliss and demanding money for their devices to be unlocked.

However, perhaps the worst breach of Apple security was the hack into the company's iCloud that saw the leak of hundreds of personal and naked photographs belonging to celebrities, Jennifer Lawrence, Kelly Brook and Rihanna. 

It is thought that XAgent was designed by the group to help them obtain information from specific high profile targets.

Trend Micro said it had also identified a second malware programme that is focused on recording audio from so-called 'jailbroken' devices. These devices have had limitations on their iOS software removed, which can compromise the phone's security.

Feike Hacquebord, senior threat researcher at Trend Micro, said: 'While spyware targeting Apple users is highly notable by itself, this particular spyware is also involved in a targetted attack.

'The XAgent app is fully functional malware. After being installed on iOS 7, the app’s icon is hidden and it runs in the background immediately.

'When we try to terminate it by killing the process, it will restart almost immediately.

'Installing the malware into an iOS 8 device yields different results. The icon is not hidden and it also cannot restart automatically.

'This suggests that the malware was designed prior to the release of iOS 8 last September 2014.'

Nearly three quarters of Apple iPhones and tablets are now thought to be using iOS8, although a quarter are still running the older iOS7 software.

This could mean that up to 200 million devices could be the most vulnerable to the spyware.

Trend Micro believe the XAgent malware is related to another type of spyware it has been tracking that works on Microsoft Windows' systems called SEDNIT.

They claim that the malware has been created by a group of hackers that it calls Operation Pawn Storm. 

Trend Micro found one route of infection was through a simple lure like the one above that downloads XAgent

XAgent can turn on the microphone of any iPhone it runs on and record the sound going on around it

Experts at Micro Trend first identified Operation Pawn Storm as being behind a series of online attacks targeting military officials and defence contractors in a cyber-espionage operation.

Subsequently they have also been linked to attacks against government officials and journalists.

Trend Micro said that it is unclear exactly how the new iOS malware is spread, although the group tends to infect the devices of contacts and friends of its targets.

Writing on its blog, Mr Hacquebord and his colleagues who have been investigating XAgent, said they had seen one instance where the malware was attacked to a simple link with the words 'Tap Here to Install the Application'.

However, they added: 'The exact methods of installing these malware is unknown.

'There may be other methods of infection that are used to install this particular malware.

'One possible scenario is infecting an iPhone after connecting it to a compromised or infected Windows laptop via a USB cable.'

MailOnline has contacted Apple for comment. 

Apple is thought to have sold more than 800 million of its mobile iOS devices including the new iPhone 6
