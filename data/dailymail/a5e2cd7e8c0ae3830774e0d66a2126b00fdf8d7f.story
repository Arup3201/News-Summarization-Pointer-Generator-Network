In a statement to the Free Press on Tuesday, a representative for Breathe Life Healing Centers said the Fisher mansion is being renovated to serve as both the company's newest spiritual retreat center and Lamm's primary residence. 

'Each (center) offers a welcoming atmosphere coupled with amenities and grounds designed to encourage serenity and self-reflection,' the statement read.

A Breathe Life spokesman said the center, which could open as early as this winter, won't provide medical care onsite, reports CBS Detroit. 

A separate facility on 7 Mile Road near Livernois would treat clients' medical needs.

Palmer Woods Association board member Rochelle Lento says neighbors are 'very concerned' about the center. 

She says it doesn't fit zoning guidelines for the residential community.

Craig Vanderburg, president of the Palmer Woods Association, told Detroit Free Press said residents would like more information regarding the house's role in the rehab business.

It's also unclear whether the plans would require a zoning change or permit. 

'Our biggest concern is exactly what do they intend to utilize the Fisher mansion for,' Vanderburg said.

Palmer Woods was home to many of history's auto industry giants, including the top brass at GM and Ford as well as the Fisher family

Few photos exist of all seven of the Fisher brothers together.  This one was taken on August 22, 1927

Architect Richard Marr, interior designer Wallace Newton and landscape architect Bryant Fleming built the home for Alfred J. Fisher and his wife Alma. 

He was one of the seven Fisher brothers who owned the Fisher Body Company, making car bodies for the booming auto industry. 

Their company began the early 1900 when, two of the brothers went from Ohio to Detroit,  to work in the first 'horseless carriage' body shops. 

In 1908 they decided to go into business for themselves as the Fisher Body Company and developed a new chassis. 

By 1913, the Fisher Body Company had the capacity to produce 100,000 cars per year and customers included: Ford, Krit, Chalmers, Cadillac, Oldsmobile and Studebaker.

By 1926 was one of the world's largest manufacturing companies and was sold to General Motors. 

The brothers resigned from General Motors to devote their time to other interests in 1944 and in 1972, the last of the Fisher brothers died.

It also has a 25-yard indoor swimming pool - the two acre lot is filled with gardens, ponds and a tea house.

When the mansion was up for sale. owner Matthew Duffield told MyFox Detroit the house had lots of offers coming in but he was waiting for the right one. 

'We're kind of being patient. We're very confident that a Detroit family, someone that knows the history, that wants to be in the region not just as an investor, that's who we're looking for.' 

'There's an unbelievable amount of history that they have with the home and about the home.' 

'The doors are all solid. The hand carved woodworking is meticulous,' said Duffield, adding four Italian woodworkers spent two years hand carving one particular piece. 

The Fisher family sold the house to the University of Detroit Mercy in 1968, which then sold it off to a private buyer.  

The company website states that Lamm 'began his own journey in recovery in 2003. His very first treatment was for drugs, bulimia, smoking and alcohol – all at the same time. 

'To many, it seemed an impossible challenge. 

'Today with over a decade of sobriety, Brad has shown that even the most challenging cases of addiction can not only recover but can offer hope to those in the grips of an eating disorder or drug addiction.'
