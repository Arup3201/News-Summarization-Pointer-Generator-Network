Getting a flat tyre and not having a spare would leave most motorists stranded.

But for Russian motorist Bogdan Evseyev, getting a wheel puncture proved no problem.

That's because the innovative 43-year-old removed the whole wheel and replaced it using a sledge.

Russian motorist Bogdan Evseyev replaced his flat car tyre with a sledge that he had in the boot of his car

Mr Evseyev used the sledge, which belonged to his son as he didn't have a spare tyre and didn't want to be stranded 

Mr Evseyev came to a stop while driving his car after suffering from a flat tyre and not having a spare to replace it.

Knowing that it would have left him stranded, he remembered he still had his son's sledge in the boot.

He then simply removed the flat tyre and wedged the sledge underneath the wheel axle.

And this then allowed him to try the short distance over the snow and ice-covered roads to the tyre repair garage at his home in the town of Belovo in southern Russia's Kemerovo Oblast region.

Eyewitness Nestor Ulyanov saw Mr Evseyev carry out the makeshift repair and filmed the car driving across the ice.

He then uploaded the video to social media together with the message, 'Never underestimate a Russian, we always come out winners.'

Mr Ulyanov took a video of the makeshift repair and uploaded it to the internet with the message, 'Never underestimate a Russian, we always come out winners' 

But Mr Ulyanov, 38, explained that although he expected the plan to backfire, the stunt worked really well.

He explained: 'We videoed it for a short time using my mobile phone, and then we saw him pull over to the garage at the side of the road.

'I stopped to tell them that I thought it was really hilarious. I had a chat with the car driver, I told him I was going to put the video online.

'The sledge once they got it out from underneath was surprisingly undamaged, apart from having a few smudges of oil.

'But I reckon even buying a new one is still going to be cheaper than a tow truck - and probably quicker.'
