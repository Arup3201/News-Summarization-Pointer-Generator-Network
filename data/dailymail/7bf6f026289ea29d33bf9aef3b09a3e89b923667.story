A teacher who slipped in 'something gooey' as she side-stepped a slice of discarded ham was awarded a £17,000 compensation pay out, it emerged today.

The teacher was awarded the money after 
she fell while trying to avoid the meat, which had been dropped on the 
floor of the lunch hall at Backwell School in Backwell, Somerset.

Her claim was among a number of bizarre payouts, estimated to have cost councils in and around Bristol nearly £150,000, prompting warnings about a 'compensation culture' in schools.

Across England a total of £4million has been paid out in compensation and costs by councils for accidents and injuries at schools.

Matthew Sinclair of the TaxPayers’ 
Alliance said: 'Education chiefs must resist the creeping compensation 
culture that is to be found in too many schools these days.'

South Gloucestershire Council found itself embroiled in an eight-year legal battle after a teacher tripped on a football net, a saga which ended in a four day court hearing.

The teacher got his foot caught in a loose goal net and was demanding £30,000 in compensation - but was handed just £619.50.

However, because the council was judged to be partly to blame for the accident it was forced to pay £82,070 in legal fees, including the cost of the claimant’s solicitors.

The money was paid in 2011-12, eight years after the accident at the undisclosed school in 2004.

Council spokesman Dominic Moody said:
'The council contested the claim on the basis that the teacher had been
negligent of their personal health and safety.

'The
judge found that not only was the claimant 50 per cent responsible for 
their own accident but the injuries were far less serious than claimed, 
resulting in a compensation payment of only £619.50, significantly less 
than the £30,000 originally claimed.

'The
bulk of the costs were the claimant’s solicitors’ fees which, in spite 
of our success in the case, were awarded, in their entirety, against the
council.

'Under the old 
regulations, the costs followed the case, regardless of contributory 
negligence being found on the part of the claimant.

'This
particular case ran for eight years with four days in court, hence the 
high level of costs, and, as the council were found contributory 
negligent, the costs were awarded in their entirety against the 
council.'

He added that reforms introduced at the end of July this year meant that in future cases, such 'disparity of costs compared to damages' should not happen again.

North Somerset Council has dealt with 35 claims made by teachers, support staff and pupils between 2008 and 2013 relating to incidents in its schools, including the ham-related fall at Backwell School.

At St Katherine’s School, in Pill, a pupil was awarded £15,719 after he cut his knee open on a protruding paving slab.

The youngster was running towards the school’s playing fields with his classmates to play rugby when he slipped on wet leaves and fell down a grass bank.

A boy at Worle School, Weston-super-Mare, was awarded £9,666 after he slipped on a wet floor in his tutor room and landed on his elbow, causing it to fracture.

And at St Martin’s School, in Worle, a pupil was handed £12,442 after suffering burns to an arm while working with a teacher to build a wooden rocket.

The youngster said the teacher had refilled a glue gun and pumped it, causing the substance to drip on to the unnamed pupil’s arm, causing burns.

Other recent claims in South Gloucestershire include one by a teaching assistant who fractured her foot after catching her shoe on an uneven playground surface while loading waste into a skip.

In February 2011, she received £2,800 in compensation and the council had to pay a further £7,500 to cover the claimant’s legal fees.

Bristol City Council said it could not supply details of compensation claims made by teaching staff and students in the last few years because it could lead to the disclosure of personal data.

Hilda Kalap, spokeswoman for the authority, said: 'We have only had one successful compensation claim made by teaching staff against the council over the last five years.'

The total claimed by tripping teachers and slipping students in Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire was £148,127.

The pattern seems to be repeating itself across the country, after Kirklees Council in West Yorkshire was forced to pay £20,000 after a teacher took the authority to court after being bitten by a flea.

The bite triggered an allergic reaction which caused ulcers and pain lasting for two years.

Initially the council refused to pay up, saying it was not negligent, but then coughed up.

A spokesman said: 'The case was 
settled out of court following legal advice and the claimant received 
compensation of around £5,000.

'The remainder was spent on the necessary legal fees.

'This was an unusual situation. Other
medical conditions meant the bite became infected, leading to swelling 
and ulceration and up to two years of pain.'

Another case cost a London council 
£220,000 - including £174,000 legal and other costs - when a teacher 
suffered nose and eye injuries after being hit in the face with a set of
maracas in Hounslow.

And in Rochdale, a teacher who strained their back while lifting a table received over £10,000.

However, teaching union NASUWT dismissed claims that there was a compensation culture within schools.

General secretary Chris Keates said: 'It is a myth that compensation is easy to obtain.'
