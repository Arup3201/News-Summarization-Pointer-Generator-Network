Most foods come with use-by dates, but the majority of the time this is simply a guide, making it difficult to know when food is safe to eat.

This is a particular problem with poultry and other meats, but could soon be a thing of the past.

Scientists have developed a gadget that 'sniffs' meat to test its freshness, and warns you if its gone off, or needs to be put back in the fridge.

The PERES device, pictured, works by scanning the air around meat for volatile compounds and gases released by rotting meat. The device takes a reading of the air and sends it a phone or tablet app via Bluetooth

To take a reading, open the app and press the Get button on the top of the PERES device.

The device is fitted with gas, temperature and humidity sensors.

It works by taking a sample of the air around the meat and scans for potentially volatile compounds that rotting meat produces.

PERES works with pork, poultry, beef and fish.

This data is transmitted from PERES to the app via Bluetooth and the results can be shared to Facebook, Twitter and Google+.

It can detect whether the product is fresh, whether it may have been left unrefrigerated, and warn if there is a risk of food poisoning. 

It will track changes in freshness to give users an idea how long the food will last, and sends these readings to a smartphone app.

To take a reading, users open the app and press the 'Get' button on the top of the device.

The PERES is fitted with gas, temperature and humidity sensors that take a sample of the air around the meat.

It scans this sample for potentially volatile compounds that rotting meat produce, and the device works with pork, poultry, beef and fish.

User then get a reading on the app, and the device can detect whether the product is fresh, if it may have been left unrefrigerated, and will warn them if there is a risk of food poisoning. 

This data is transmitted from PERES to the app via Bluetooth and the results can be shared to Facebook, Twitter and Google+ - if you particularly like discussing mouldy food with your friends.

PERES
 was developed by Lithuania-based ARS Lab with scientists from the 
Kaunas University of Technology. The prototype took a year to develop.

ARS Lab‘s CEO Augustas Alesiunas said the idea for the device came about after he suffered from a serious bout of food poisoning.

The device will retail for $150 (£90) with free shipping to the U.S and Europe. Shipping to the rest of the world will cost an extra $15 (£9). Final samples are expected to be shipped by November this year and the device will be sold in black, blue, green, pink, white, pictured

‘We had prepared and eaten food in our home just like any other day, but when my family and I all suffered food poisoning we realised there must have been something wrong with the food that hadn’t been obvious at the time.'

The World Health Organisation claims more
 than 200 diseases are spread through food, and more than 5,000 deaths 
in the U.S last year were linked to food borne illnesses.

‘That was when I first envisioned a tool that could check whether the food I was preparing was as fresh as it seemed, so I could be sure I was making healthy meals for my family,' continued Alesiunas.

Alesiunas has now set up an Indiegogo campaign to raise money to further develop the device and fund its production. 

He is looking to raise $100,000 (£60,000) and his current total stands at $14,890 (£8,980). The campaign ends on May 11.

If it achieves funding, Alesiunas said the device will retail for $150 (£90) with free shipping to the U.S and Europe. Shipping to the rest of the world will cost an extra $15 (£9).

Final products are expected to be shipped by November and will be sold in black, blue, green, pink and white.
