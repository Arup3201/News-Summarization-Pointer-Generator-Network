'Son of Sam' serial killer David Berkowitz will remain in prison for another two years after he failed to turn up for his latest parole hearing.

The notorious serial killer, who terrorized New York City between 1976-77, didn't attend as he believes 'Jesus has forgiven him and set him free', his lawyer told the New York Post.

Berkowitz, 60, was denied parole last week at Sullivan Correctional Facility in Fallsburg, New York, his seventh hearing since he became eligible for release in 2002.

His next parole hearing is scheduled for two years' time in 2016.

Berkowitz's lawyer Mark J. 
Heller, told the Post that during his decades in jail, his client became
 a born-again Jew for Jesus and doesn't seek freedom from the parole 
board.

Berkowitz, who was raised Jewish, joined the evangelical organization behind bars and became a minister's assistant.

'Son of Sam' shot dead six young people and injured seven other victims during a gun rampage in New York City in the late Seventies.

The 22-year-old stalked his victims down city streets or surprised them while they sat in cars, shooting with a .44 caliber Bulldog revolver.

He taunted police with letters throughout the massive manhunt which promised he would murder again.

When Berkowitz was finally caught, he claimed that his neighbor's dog called Sam told him to do it.
