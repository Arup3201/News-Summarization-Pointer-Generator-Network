Ryan French died after being hit by the train on the Southend Victoria to London Liverpool Street line on September 18 last year

A 'popular' teenager was hit by a train after becoming worried about rumours circulating on Facebook, an inquest has heard.

Ryan French died after being hit by the train on the Southend Victoria to London Liverpool Street line on September 18 last year.

The inquest heard how the 16-year-old had become worried about rumours posted online about him and a girl on social media sites.

He is also said to have told a friend that the only way he could get out of it was to kill himself.

Coroner Yvonne Blake revealed Mr French’s concerns over the internet gossip before he was hit by the train at Rayleigh, Essex nine days before his 17th birthday.

She said: 'He was worried about the rumours on Twitter and Facebook (to do with the girl) and was said to have remarked to a friend, "The only way I can get out of this is if I kill myself".

'The friend didn’t take him seriously and started to laugh.'

The hearing in Southend, Essex also heard that on the day he died he contacted his parents by text message and said: 'It would be better for everyone if I was no longer here.'

A post mortem found traces of ecstasy, cocaine and cannabis in Ryan’s system, but these were unlikely to have affected him at the time of his death.

The teenager - who had left his comprehensive school after his GCSEs - was a regular cannabis user, the inquest heard.

He had also been close to his grandparents, and his grandfather passed away two months before he died, it was said.

Ms Blake said to his mother Karen: 'You 
were worried about the message and told him not to do anything, and that
you were always available, you spoke to his friends who told you that 
he seemed okay.'

Friends and relatives of Ryan French left tributes to the talented young footballer who was about to turn 17

He had once previously threatened to take his own life, but had been described by friends as 'a genuinely happy person who liked making friends and generally having a good time.'

Ms Blake told Mr French’s mother, father, brother and sister: 'It’s a very sad day for you, I wish to send my truly sincere condolences.'

Ryan, who lived in Rayleigh, was a keen footballer who played for Downhall and Rayleigh Boys FC.

After his death around 30 people walked 17 miles from Rayleigh train station to Southend seafront and back in his memory and to raise money for a memorial bench in King George’s playing field, where the teenager used to frequent.

Ms Blake gave a narrative verdict on the 'sad' death, saying he had been struck by the train as the driver couldn’t stop in time.
