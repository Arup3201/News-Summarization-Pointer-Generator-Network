The mastermind behind Amazon.com, Jeff Bezos, is a tough taskmaster who at just three years of age took his own crib apart with a screwdriver because he wanted a real bed, reveals a new book.

He is the subject of a new biography that gives a number of fascinating insights into the bullish management style of one of the key architects of the internet age.

The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos And The Age Of Amazon was released on Tuesday and tells the story of the creation and amazing growth of the online retailer, which launched in 1995 and sold $61billion worth of goods last year alone.

Bullish, driven and determined: Bezos founded Amazon.com in a bid to live life without regrets

Author Brad Stone, who also writes for Businessweek, approached Bezos and asked if he could tell his story. Although Bezos refused to be interviewed for the book, he encouraged friends, family and company executives to talk to the author.

The amazing success of the company has
 earned Bezos a reputation as someone who can be unsparing in his 
criticism and isn’t an easy man to work for.

‘If
 you’re not good, Jeff will chew you up and spit you out. And if you are
 good, he will jump on your back and ride you into the ground,’ is one 
quote about Bezos’s management style in the book.

Amazon has earned a reputation for being an incredibly ruthless negotiator with the companies that it does business with.

The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos And The Age Of Amazon' was released on Tuesday and tells the story of the creation and amazing growth of the online retailer

Stone
 describes Amazon’s culture as 'notoriously confrontational, and it 
begins with Bezos, who believes that truth springs forth when ideas and 
perspectives are banged against each other, sometimes violently'.

In the book it is revealed that Bezos 
once suggested that Amazon approach small publishers in the same way
 that a cheetah approaches a sick gazelle.

The
 environment isn’t for everyone and turnover among top executives is high, writes Stone. He quotes one observer as saying that 
Amazon executives 'have an absolute willingness to torch the landscape 
around them to emerge the winner.'

Stone also writes that 
Bezos can be kind to people, but is well-known for going on rants that
 other employees refer to as 'nutters', and that he has a reputation for asking his employees
 provocative questions, such as 'Does it surprise you that you don’t know the answer to that question?', or 'Why are you ruining my life?'.

After graduating from Princeton in 1986, Bezos worked at the hedge fund D.E. Shaw before deciding to setup his own company.

Since launching in 1995, Amazon has become the world's largest online retailer and last year it sold $61billion of goods

In
 the book it is revealed that he was so eager to get started on his own 
that he left before the end of the financial year and so walked away 
from a very large financial bonus.

The
 gamble has certainly paid off, but it hasn’t been plain sailing and the
 company suffered a dramatic downturn during the dot-com bubble at the 
turn of the century.

Amazon’s
 stock hit a high of almost $107 a share during the first dot-com 
boom, but then plunged below $6 after the market collapsed. It 
has since soared to more than $300 a share.

Stone writes that Bezos had an ordinary childhood with his mother and stepfather, but that his real father, Ted Jorgensen, was a one-time circus performer whom his mother told to stay out of their lives when Bezos was just four years old.

Jorgensen has revealed that he plans to contact the billionaire Amazon founder after only learning about who his son had become from author Stone.

Then and now: Ted Jorgensen was a teenage unicyclist (left) when his son Jeffrey was born, and he only learned that the boy grew up to be Jeff Bezos last year (pictured right this year, at age 69)

Jorgensen was an 18-year-old unicyclist who was a rising star on the niche circuit when his girlfriend, Jackie Gise, became pregnant.

The pair traveled to New Mexico to get married - because she was too young under American law - and then returned and had a makeshift ceremony at her house, where both of their mothers signed their marriage application form. 

Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen was born on January 12, 1964, and 17 months later, Ted and Jackie got a divorce. Both Jackie and her father told Ted never to contact the family again, and he agreed.

She then started dating her co-worker, Mike Bezos, who she eventually married.

Gise asked Jorgensen's legal permission to allow her new husband to adopt their son, Jeffrey, and he agreed.

Fast forward 47 years and reporter Stone 
went to the small bike-repair shop in Glendale, Arizona, that Jorgensen 
owns and he found the 69-year-old working behind the counter.

'I’d considered a number of ways he might react to my unannounced appearance but gave a very low probability to the likelihood of what actually happened: He had no idea what I was talking about,' Stone writes.

'Jorgensen said he didn’t know who Jeff Bezos was and was baffled by my suggestion that he was the father of this famous CEO.'

It was only after the author brought up Jeff's mother Jackie Gise and their infant son Jeffrey that he saw the wheels in Jorgensen's head begin to turn before seeing his eyes fill 'with sorrow and disbelief'.

Stone then met with Jorgensen and his current wife Linda, who has four children that he helped raise.

'I wasn’t a good father or a husband,' Jorgensen said of his first marriage.

'It was really all my fault. I don’t blame Jackie at all.'
