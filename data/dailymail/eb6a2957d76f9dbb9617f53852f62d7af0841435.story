Google unveiled plans earlier this year for a cancer-detecting wristband that it was testing using moulds of human skin.

Now the firm has been awarded a patent for the technology that will 'automatically modify or destroy  targets in the blood that have an adverse health effect'.

According to the files, the wearable could target these cells using an 'external energy source' such as ultrasound or radio frequencies.

Google's patent explained its wearable (illustrated) could target any substances or objects that, when present in the blood, may affect the health of a wearer by transmitting energy into the vessels. This could include infrared signals, a radio-frequency or acoustic pulse, or a magnetic field

'A number of scientific methods have been developed to examine physiological conditions of a person by detecting and measuring one or more analytes [chemicals] in a person's blood,' explained the Nanoparticle Phoresis patent.

'Analytes could...be indicative of a medical condition or health of the person' and could include 'enzymes, hormones, proteins, cells or other substances.'

Google continued that its wearable would target  any substances or objects that, when present in the blood, may affect  the health of wearer by transmitting energy into the vessels. 

In an interview with Bloomberg, Google Ventures' president Bill Maris recently said he thinks it's possible to live to 500 years old.

And this will be helped by medical breakthroughs as well as a rise in biomechanics.

He has already ploughed money into genetics firms and cancer diagnostic startups and said: 'We have the tools in the life sciences to achieve anything that you have the audacity to envision. I just hope to live long enough not to die.'

Mr Maris founded Google Ventures in 2009 and oversees all of the fund’s global activities. 

Elsewhere he has develop Google’s Calico project.

Calico is a research and development company set up in 2013 by Google and Apple to tackle 'ageing and associated diseases.'

Google co-founder Larry Page said the project would focus on 'health, wellbeing and longevity' and last September Calico partnered with AbbVie to open a research centre into neurodegeneration and cancer.

This could include infrared signals, a radio-frequency or acoustic pulse, or a magnetic field. 

The energy used would depend on what the band is targeting, but it would be designed to alter the chemical composition of the analyte.

'In one relevant example, certain proteins have been implicated as a partial cause of Parkinson's disease; the development of Parkinson's disease may be prevented or retarded by providing particles functionalized with a bioreceptor that will selectively bind to this target' continued the files. 

'These bound particles may then be used, in combination with a wearable device as described above, to modify or destroy the target protein.

'As a further example, the target could be cancer cells; by selectively targeting and then modifying or destroying the cancer cells, the spread of cancer may be diminished.'  

In January, Andrew Conrad, head of Google Life Sciences unveiled plans for a wristband which would work with nanoparticles that circulate around the body looking for cells.

After travelling around the body, these nanoparticles would then be collected, using a magnet, to reveal what cells they encountered. 

The nanoparticles would cause the cancer cells to light up, for example, allowing the wristband to record whether there are dangerous cells in the body.

The system relies on light emitted from the cells as a result of the nanoparticles, so scientists must understand how light passes through skin. So Google started making skin.

It would scan the blood for so-called analytes, or chemicals, in the blood such as the presence of 'enzymes, hormones, proteins, cells or other substances.' Google said it could target certain proteins that have been implicated as a partial cause of Parkinson's disease, for example, or cancer cells

In January, Google's Life Sciences lab unveiled plans for a wristband which would work with nanoparticles that circulate around the body looking for cells. To assist with their research, the scientists made moulds of human arms using both synthetic and real human skin from donors (pictured)

As the wearable is still in the early stages of development, Google X is working to determine what defines a 'healthy' person.

They are monitoring 175 healthy volunteers to frequently collect physiological information.

Mr Conrad admitted that people may find it 'weird' having particles constantly tracking the cells in their body.

'It's way weirder to have cancer cells floating through your body that are constantly trying to kill you,' Mr Conrad continued. 

He said that the Google X team is trying to change medicine from being episodic and reactive to being proactive and preventive.  

'We're making good progress but the journey is long and hard, he said. 'So I think we will get there and I hope it's years, not decades.'
