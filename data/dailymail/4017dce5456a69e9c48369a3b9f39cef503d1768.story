Rima Fakih, the first Arab-American to be crowned Miss USA, has been sentenced to probation and community service in a drunken driving case.

The 26-year-old former beauty queen avoided the possibility of jail time during Wednesday's hearing in Highland Park, an enclave of Detroit.

Judge William McConico put her on six months' probation, ordered 20 hours of community service and said she must pay $600 in fines and costs.

Punishment: Ms Fakih, and her lawyer W. Otis Culpepper (right), accepted a plea deal where she has six months' probation, 20 hours of community service and $600 in fines

Fakih also must attend an alcohol safety class. She pleaded no contest last month to driving while visibly impaired.

She has said she wasn't drinking on 
the night of her arrest in December, but two police breath tests put 
Fakih's blood alcohol content at more than twice the legal limit.

The former Miss Michigan was crowned Miss USA in 2010.

Her lawyer, W Otis Culpepper, 
predicted that Fakih would be sentenced to probation, which he said she 
could serve in California, where she is pursuing opportunities in the 
entertainment industry.

Fakih will 'get back to California and get on 
with being a Hollywood kind of person,' Culpepper said.

A trial had been planned before 30th 
District Court Judge Brigette Officer on the original charges of drunken
driving, careless driving and having an open container of alcohol.

Police said Fakih was driving 60mph in
a 30 mph zone and weaving in and out of traffic before they pulled her 
over in her hometown of Highland Park on December 3.Â 

Officers found an 
open bottle of champagne behind the driver's seat of the 2011 Jaguar.

One breath test put her blood alcohol 
content at 0.20 percent and another put it at 0.19 percent. The legal 
limit is .08 percent.

Fakih's family moved to New York from Lebanon in 1993, and then to the Detroit suburb of Dearborn ten years later.

Making history: Rima Fakih was the first Arab-American voted Miss USA

Though she denied in previous court appearances (above) that she was drunk at the December incident, breathalyzer tests put her twice the legal limit

When she won the Miss USA Pageant in 
May 2010, she became the first Arab-American to do so. Supporters 
described her win as a victory for diversity, saying it countered 
negative stereotypes about people of Middle Eastern descent that have 
flourished in post-9/11 America.

Shortly after she was crowned, photos emerged of the beauty queen in a 2007 poll dancing competition, causing a scandal.

Her reign as Miss USA ended in June of last year.
