Claim: Kate Tantum, the daughter of a former MI6 director, has taken her former employer Travers Smith to a tribunal over unfair dismissal after she fell pregnant

A new mother has accused a top City law firm of sexual discrimination claiming she was rejected for a permanent job as she was pregnant.

Katie Tantum took her three-month-old daughter Heidi to her employment tribunal, where she made the claims.

The daughter of a former director of MI6, Miss Tantum, 33, was a trainee on £42,000 a year at Travers Smith when she told them she was expecting a baby.

The Cambridge graduate claims the company failed to offer her a permanent contract because they did not want to pay maternity leave. Now she is claiming for loss of earnings.

Her fiancé Stuart Tozer and his mother have also been on hand to look after the baby in the four-day hearing.

In March last year Miss Tantum, from Kew, west London, said she discovered she was pregnant and told her bosses.

She said they were initially ‘understanding’ and ‘seemed supportive’ but over the following months her supervisor ‘just stopped bothering with me’.

She said: ‘It was as though investing time and  effort in my training stopped being worth his while.’

Miss Tantum said once she became visibly pregnant she felt the need to tell people she was not planning to take her full maternity leave and was ‘absolutely committed to returning to the firm’.

However, in May she learned that she was not to be offered a permanent contract with the firm. She said senior partner Andrew King told her that ‘no one put their hand up’ for her.

She said: ‘I was one of only three trainees out of 22 not retained permanently or given a minimum one-year contract.’

Fluent in French and German, Miss Tantum worked in recruitment and public relations before going into law.

Unfair: Ms Tantum was one of only three trainees not kept on and believes that this was due to her pregnancy

After a period in property law in France
she moved back to London and was accepted on to the trainee scheme at 
Travers Smith, one of the leading smaller law firms in the City.

Miss Tantum started on a £38,000 salary but described an atmosphere 
where staff were expected to work into the early hours. That contrasted 
with a statement on its website about its culture where the firm says: 
‘There is certainly no staying late to look good’.

She said: ‘The firm’s current selection process basically comprises of a single subjective criterion which is: who do the partners want to employ after September?

‘In my case, the criterion translated as do you want a newly qualified 
solicitor who will be here or one who is going off on maternity leave?’

Action: The headquarters of law firm, Travers Smith, who Miss Tantum alleges fired her as she was pregnant

Miss Tantum – whose father Geoffrey is a former Middle East Director for
MI6 – claims the firm ‘frowned upon’ people who wanted to work family 
friendly hours. She said: ‘I believe I was not fairly considered and 
that the reason for that was my pregnancy and or planned maternity 
leave.’

The tribunal was told that of the 66 partners at Travers Smith, only ten are women. But Kathleen Anne 
Russ, partner and head of tax at the firm, denied discrimination.

Asked if Miss Tantum was discriminated against she said: ‘That’s just 
totally wrong and I think it’s absolutely shown to be wrong when you see
how many people in our department are mothers and have gone through 
maternity leave.

‘I myself have had two children and maternity leave. I find it very sad that it is being alleged.’

The case continues.
