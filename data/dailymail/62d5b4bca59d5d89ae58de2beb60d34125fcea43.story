She loved his predecessor 'to bits' and insisted that he always be present during her Balmoral summer holidays.

But the Queen seemed just as thrilled to see 'Pony Major' Cruachan VI for a second time as she officially moved in to her Scottish holiday home today.

The black Shetland pony was celebrating his fifth birthday but joined the men from the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders to give the monarch a ceremonial welcome home.

Naughty! Cruachan VI appears to be going for demotion as he raises his lip at the Queen's outstretched hand

All smiles: The Queen beams as she is reunited with Cruachan IV and his handler, Major Cpl Mark Wilkinson

Traditional: The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders provide the traditional welcome to the Queen at Balmoral

But disaster almost struck when the naughty pony rolled his top lip back as the Queen approached, although the monarch didn't appear too concerned.

The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders is one of the UK's most famous regiments and began life in 1881 before going on to fight in every major conflict of the 20th century.

Now part of the Royal Regiment of Scotland along with the Black Watch, the Royal Scots Borderers, the Royal Highland Fusiliers and the Highlanders, the Shetland mascot tradition began in 1928 and continues despite the merger.

The first to march with the regiment was Cruachan I, a jet black Shetland pony gelding, who joined with the title of 'Pony Major'.

Moving in: The Queen spent last week elsewhere because Balmoral hadn't yet been closed to the public

Enjoying the day: The Queen was all smiles as she inspected the men and their Pony Major in lovely sunshine

Cheers: A crowd of well-wishers was waiting outside Balmoral to see the Queen and the troops

Last meeting: The Queen's favourite Cruachan III and Corporal Joe Walker meet the monarch in 2012

Since then, the position has been held by another three black Shetland geldings, with Cruachan III, a pony especially adored by the Queen, retiring at the grand old age of 23 in 2012.

During his tenure, he made regular visits to Balmoral and led the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders and the Royal Regiment of Scotland, at events and parades, including the Edinburgh Military Tattoo.

'Heâ€™s done a lot of parades in his time and he was a real favourite of the Queen,' revealed handler Captain Dougie McDougall at the time of his retirement.

'If she was ever on holiday and knew Cruachan was around she would make sure he was there on the day that she arrived. She loves him to bits.'

Retired: Cruachan III has now retired from ceremonial duties and spends his time munching grass in a field

Lifelong friends: Placid Cruachan III lives with his feistier companion, piebald Shetland pony Islay

Also popular: Cruachan II, the second pony to hold the title of Pony Major, also proved a favourite of the Queen's

But with Cruachan III now enjoying a peaceful retirement with his companion, a piebald Shetland named Islay, the Queen is getting to know his replacement - and certainly seemed to be enjoying the experience.

Her Majesty is a long-standing fan of Shetland ponies, having begun her own riding career at the age of four on the back of another Shetland, Peggy.

She is also a fan of another Scottish breed, the Highland pony, which she breeds from a stud attached to Balmoral.

Well trained: Cruachan II welcomes the regiment home from Cyprus in Southampton in 1959

Number one: The first Shetland pony mascot, Cruachan I, served with the regiment from 1928 to 1942
