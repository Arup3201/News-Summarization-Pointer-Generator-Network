A woman choking to death on a piece of lamb chop was asked to move because she was ‘upsetting’ other customers in a curry house, an inquest was told.

Helen Peploe, 56, began coughing violently when part of her mixed kebab became lodged in her throat.

As her partner, Neil Whitcher, desperately tried to dislodge the food using the Heimlich manoeuvre, he claims staff told him to take her to the toilet.

Tragic: Helen Peploe (left) suffered a fatal heart attack after she choked on a piece of lamb at an Indian restaurant in Bolton. Her partner Neil Whitcher tried to save her life by attempting the Heimlich manoeuvre

Restaurant: Mr Whitcher told the inquest staff at the Royal Balti House, in Bolton, told the couple to go upstairs because Miss Peploe was 'upsetting other customers'

Miss Peploe, a charity worker, lost 
consciousness in the  restaurant, suffered a heart attack and died 48 
hours later in hospital.

An inquest heard the couple had gone out for a meal at  the Royal Balti House, Bolton, on July 5.

Mr
Whitcher, 50, had enjoyed a meal there before, but said the food served
this time had been poor quality.

‘The lamb was all fat and gristle – it
was disgusting,’ he said. ‘I didn’t like it so took it out of my mouth 
but she said she would try a piece.

‘She went to spit it out but it slid down her throat.

Couple: After the inquest Mr Whitcher (pictured with Miss Peploe) claimed the restaurant should have shown 'more compassion'

Denial: The restaurant manager Mohammed Iqbal Bhuiyan denied Mr Whitcher's claims that they weren't given adequate attention

‘She
began to projectile vomit and was being sick on the table so I began to
bang on her back like I had been shown in first aid training …then one 
of the waiters told me to take her upstairs because she was upsetting 
other guests.

'I took her to the bathroom and she was still coughing.

‘Then
the waiter came in and asked if there was anything he could do. I asked
if he had rung an ambulance and he said “No”, so I told him to ring 
one.’

Mr Whitcher, a former
lorry driver, added: ‘When I was on the phone to the ambulance they 
told me to put her on one side but by then her lips had gone blue.’

The
manager of the restaurant, Mohammed Iqbal Bhuiyam, denied claims the 
couple had been ushered to the  bathrooms and said they had been treated
with care and attention.

He
said a waiter had phoned  for an ambulance immediately and the couple 
were only shown upstairs because Mr Whitcher had asked to go to the 
bathroom.

He added: ‘We could see she was in some distress but [Mr Whitcher] just asked where the bathroom was.

‘Within three minutes one of my colleagues told me I needed to come to the toilet because he had called an ambulance.

‘I went upstairs and she was in the ladies’ toilet with this man and he was talking to  paramedics who were giving him advice.’

The
hearing was told the  restaurant did not have a trained first-aider 
present on the night Miss Peploe choked but had since appointed one.

Peter
Yates, who investigated the restaurant on behalf of the coroner, said 
the Royal Balti House had done nothing wrong, as it was under no 
obligation to medically treat non-employees.

Coroner Alison Mutch recorded a verdict of accidental death.

Hearing: Mr Whitcher, outside Bolton Coroner's Court, was allegedly told by staff to escort his partner to the lavatory while they dialled 999
