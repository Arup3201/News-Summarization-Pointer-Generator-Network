Sydney free-standing home prices, including terraces, were significantly higher than other capital cities, with prices in Melbourne hitting $646,500, $547,200 in Brisbane and $485,700 in Adelaide

Separate figures from SQM Research has shown the median home price in Sydney hit $1.005 million this week.

'Right now it would be impossible to purchase a free standing house in Sydney’s inner ring for under a million dollars, and will become increasingly difficult to purchase a free standing house in Sydney’s middle ring for under a million dollars,' Managing Director of SQM Research, Louis Christopher, said.

Sydney free-standing home prices, including terraces, were significantly higher than other capital cities, with the median price of a home in Melbourne hitting $646,500, $547,200 in Brisbane and $485,700 in Adelaide.

SQM Research's Louis Christopher says it's impossible to buy a free-standing home in Sydney's inner ring for under $1 million. This property in Strathfield sold for $3.6 million last week

The $1 million price tag is 7.2 percent higher than this time last year and 22 percent higher than three years ago.

The median asking price for units in Sydney sits at $569,000.

It comes as a new survey by ME Bank showed 26 percent of young Australians believed they will never be able to afford to buy their own home.

ME Bank General Manager Asset Products, Luke Easton said it's a sign of how challenging housing affordability has become for many Australians.  

'A large group of young people are delaying or ruling out home ownership altogether,' Mr Easton said.

He said the financial challenges faced by first home buyers, including some of the highest property prices in the world, were forcing young buyers to be creative in their pursuits for the 'great Australian dream.'
