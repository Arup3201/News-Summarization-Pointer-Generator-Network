A Louisiana line cook got some divine inspiration on Monday when he sliced into an eggplants and found God.

Clearly spelled out in the vegetable he cut for his job at Gino's restaurant in Baton Rouge were the perfectly formed letters: 'GoD..'

'I couldn't think of anything,' the flabbergasted father of four told WAFB. 'I just had to tell somebody to come look at it.'

Undeniable: A Louisiana line cook made this miraculous discovery while slicing eggplants at a Baton ROuge restaurant

Brady showed one of the restaurant owners the miraculous sight and posed for photos in which he proudly displayed his vegetable.

Co-owner Gino Marino was as shocked as Brady.

'You could cut one million eggplants and you'd probably never see it again,' Marino told WAFB.

Brady said the discovery had a meaning far deeper than mere coincidence.

'Through the road, he's showing me that "hey, I'm real" and that's the only thing I can depend on,' Brady said.

His boss agreed.

'He's showing me that "hey, I'm real"': Jemarcus Brady made the discovery Monday and believes it is a subtle sign from God

'God is within us,' Marino said. 'this is just one way of showing it.'

As shocking as it seems, this isn't the first time--or even the second--that someone has seen the divine in the purple vegetable.

Last spring, a Hindu caterer in Leicester, England found what he believed was the undeniable likeness of the elephant-headed god Ganesh in an eggplant.

In 2007, a Pennsylvania woman found the word God spelled in her eggplant, just like Brady.

And holy eggplants aren't just for Christians and Hindus. A Muslim in Jordan believed he found an eggplant in which the word God was spelled in Arabic.

'You could cut one million eggplants and you'd probably never see it again,' said restaurant co-owner Gino Marino
