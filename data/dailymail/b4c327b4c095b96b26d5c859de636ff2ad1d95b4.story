Hundreds of high profile media personalities have banded together in bid to save ABC's award winning current affairs show Lateline. 

Journalists from the government-funded broadcaster are lobbying the ABC board, signing a petition to keep the program which has been on the air for nearly 25 years.

The Lateline staff and many of the ABC's top foreign correspondents have been joined by an estimated 350 ABC staff, including radio presenter Mark Colvin, 7.30 host Leigh Sales, newsreader Juanita Phillips and Ian Henderson, and journalist Sarah Ferguson in the campaign to keep the program on air.

Co-host of Lateline Tony Jones is considered by many to be the ABC's most senior current affairs nightly interviewer, and would be left with Q&A as the only program he hosts.

The petition reads: 'Lateline has a proud 25-year history of breaking stories, hard-hitting, exclusive interviews and setting agendas. It's a program regarded as compulsory viewing by political and business leaders.

'Do not let this important creative team be disbanded at the very time Australia needs strong, independent media, with newspapers declining and critical reporting under challenge!' 

The program, whose format consists of investigations and robust political interviews, has won many awards and has been involved in groundbreaking investigations such as the Royal Commission into child sexual abuse and exploring poverty and abuse in indigenous communities. 

Despite a pre-election promise from Prime Minister Tony Abbott that there would be no budget cuts to the ABC, the broadcaster  has come under pressure from the Federal government's funding cutbacks.

If the program is axed, it will be the latest cancellation as a result of severe budget cuts faced by the broadcaster. 

ABC managing director Mark Scott said in a speech last month that the ABC was in the process of reassessing the programs on air.

'We must accept that, in the fierce contest for audiences, where old alliances no longer work and where friends can become rivals, the ABC has to robustly review its programming and services, find new ways to keep the audiences we have and to attract new ones,' he said.

'We will make the investment necessary to deliver quality programming. But it will be prudent and we will need to make careful judgments about the audience return.'

Co-host of Lateline Tony Jones is considered by many to be the ABC's most senior current affairs nightly interviewer, and would be left with Q&A as the only program he hosts. 

A public petition has been reported to be in the works by activist organisation Get Up! to add to the efforts of the internal campaign launched by staff of the ABC.

Other programs that are being considered for cancellation include radio current affairs programs such as PM and The World Today.
