Alex Hales will have his first chance on Monday to provide the spark at the top of the order which has so often been lacking in England’s one-day cricket.

Alastair Cook confirmed on Sunday that Hales will open with him against India at Bristol at the start of England’s intensive spell of limited-overs cricket which will culminate with the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand in February.

It means Ian Bell, Cook’s most recent partner in a largely orthodox opening combination, drops down to three to allow Hales the opportunity to show he can extend his explosive Twenty20 game to the longer format.

Boom! Hales has shown in the shortest format that he can kick-start an innings at international level

‘Alex is a different batter to the other guys,’ said Cook of an opener who will have licence to attack from the off. 

‘He hits the ball incredibly hard in different areas but with an orthodox technique. He’s done really well in Twenty20 and now he can show us what he can do in 50-over cricket.’

The presence of Hales should allow Cook or Bell to play the anchor role but the captain insisted yesterday his approach will remain unchanged as he tries to extend his recovery with the bat in the Test arena. 

Confidence: Cook says winning the Test series has given him renewed confidence in his own batting

England (probable): Cook (captain), Hales, Bell, Root, Morgan, Stokes, Buttler (wicketkeeper), Jordan, Tredwell, Finn, Gurney.

India (probable): Dhawan, R Sharma, Kohli, Rahane, Raina, Dhoni (captain and wicketkeeper), Jadeja, Ashwin, Kumar, Shami, Yadav.

Start: 10.30am, Bristol County Ground. 

TV & Radio: LIVE on Sky Sports 2 from 10am; BBC 5 Live Sports Extra from 10.15am.

Umpires: Paul Reiffel (Australia) and Rob Bailey (England). TV: Michael Gough (England). Match referee: Ranjan Madugalle (Sri Lanka).

Weather: Dreadful forecast plus drainage issues mean this could be a damp squib.

‘I don’t think it changes what I do,’ said Cook. ‘The job of anyone in the top four or five is to score a hundred and set up the game. You have to try to do that in your own way.

‘My confidence is at a better level to what it was three weeks ago. You only really get confidence from winning games.’

While the selection of Hales, who has hit four centuries for Notts this season and one for the Lions, was a formality, England have resisted any temptation to make more changes to what can seem a staid approach.

That means James Vince, James Taylor and Jason Roy must wait, while the bulk of the side who won the last three Tests against India have the chance to inflict further misery on the 50-over world champions.

The decision to stage back-to-back Ashes, so costly last winter, was made to give England a better chance of breaking their perennial duck in longer global tournaments, which so nearly ended in last year’s Champions Trophy.

They play India in five 50-over games and one Twenty20 match before a series in Sri Lanka in November and then a tournament in Australia against the hosts and India ahead of the World Cup.

‘We’ve never had a period of one-day cricket like this,’ said Cook, who continues at the helm of the 50-over team after answering so many doubts about his captaincy in the last three Tests.

‘It gives us time to practice those skills that are needed in one-day cricket, especially the extra ones you need in the power-play overs with the bat, and in death bowling. That’s what we need to do if we are going to have a chance of winning the World Cup in what should be good conditions for us.’

Pressure: In the absence of Ravi Bopara a large part of the bowling burden may fall to Chris Woakes

The biggest surprise in England’s squad was the absence of Ravi Bopara, left out because of the decision to go back to four ‘specialist’ seam bowlers and a spinner rather than a part-timer as one of their five main bowlers. 

That leaves Ben Stokes and Chris Woakes, who successfully defended the 14 Lancashire needed off the final over of Saturday’s Twenty20 final against Birmingham at Edgbaston, competing for the final place in a team which sees the return of Steven Finn for the first time since being ‘unselectable’ in Australia.

Jimmy Anderson, who had a chastening time for Lancashire in that final defeat, looks likely to be rested — if a dreadful weather forecast allows a game to take place at Bristol’s redeveloped ground.

Number one: Dhoni (right) made it clear he still sees Duncan Fletcher as the main man for India

This is the form of cricket that usually stirs India into a more concerted effort but they go into this series with Duncan Fletcher’s position as coach threatened by the introduction of Ravi Shastri as team director and the standing-down of Fletcher’s support staff.

MS Dhoni insisted Fletcher remains ‘the boss’ and will stay with India for their defence of the World Cup but the tourists find themselves under the sort of pressure Cook and England were experiencing just the matter of a few weeks and three Tests ago.
