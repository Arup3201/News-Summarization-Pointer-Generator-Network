Clinging to each other and wiping the tears from their eyes, colleagues of PC Andrew Bramma today visited the spot where his police van hit a tree in a crash that killed him.

The married father-of-two, 32, died as he responded to a 999 emergency call on a country road in North Yorkshire last Saturday.

More than a dozen of his fellow officers from his old Rochdale patch arrived at the crash site today just outside the village of West Tanfield, near Ripon, with flowers, photographs and hand-written messages.

Tears: Police officers from Greater Manchester Police today comfort each other at the scene of the road accident which killed their former colleague PC Andrew Bramma

Crash: PC Bramma (left) only joined North Yorkshire Police in September last year as his friends left tributes to him at the site of the accident, which included a Manchester Police helmet

One said poignantly: 'What we have once enjoyed we can never lose, all that we love deeply becomes part of us.'

PC Bramma had only just transferred to North Yorkshire Police from the Greater Manchester force, which he joined in 2008. He was the only person in the patrol van and was pronounced dead at the scene.

Some of the uniformed officers were in tears and put their arms around each other for comfort as they stood together to look at the mass of tributes already placed at the base of the roadside tree, which still shows the scars from the crash.

Then officers stepped forward to place their own flowers and other mementoes.

Tragic: The officers brought flowers, pictures and messages for their colleague who died answering an emergency call

Emotional: The officers hug, cry and comfort one another at the crash site in West Tanfield, near Ripon

Message: This poignant ode to their comrade was one of many left at the site

Moving: PC Bramma's epaulet, poppies and a written message are attached to the tree that killed him

Among the items left was a Manchester Police helmet and one of PC Bramma's epaulets featuring his individual police number.

There were also photographs and an 'ode to a friend and colleague' on an A4 sheet of paper from 'Friends and Colleagues Rochdale B Relief'.

Traffic officers closed a short stretch of the road near West Tanfield for the informal ceremony to take place.

Tributes have poured in for Pc Bramma since his death just over a week ago.

North Yorkshire's temporary chief constable Tim Madgwick described his death as 'tragic news' and Home Secretary.

Theresa May told MPs: 'Once again this shows the dangers our police officers face on a day-to-day basis and our sympathies are with him, his family and indeed his colleagues.'

Paying their respects: Two police officers from Greater Manchester Police lay flowers this morning

Fitting: The pile of flowers, notes and other momentoes reflect the outpouring of sadness at the grade 'A' officer

In London a wreath was laid in Pc Bramma's memory at the National Police Memorial in the Mall.

North Yorkshire Police has also set up an online book of condolence.

When told about his death over the weekend, his Rochdal colleagues released a statement expressing their sorrow at the death of an ‘A* standard’ officer.

'Andrew was a great police officer and a loving family man. For anyone who knew him, Andrew was meticulous in everything he did, nothing would ever beat him and he would leave no stone unturned to find his answers. Every job he dealt with was always done to A* standard.

'Andrew leaves us all with many lasting memories - from being such a great friend, to the large amount of hand gel and protective blue gloves he used to go through at work that we teased him about daily, to being a very proud and true Yorkshire man.

'We were all proud to know and work alongside Andrew and hope to lead by the high example he set for us to follow. Our thoughts are with his wife, two lovely sons and other family and friends at this time.'
