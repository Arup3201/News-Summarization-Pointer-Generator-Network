The Russian web was ablaze with bizarre theories today at an extraordinary explosion seen by thousands of commuters in St Petersburg.

It must have seemed like the end of the world was nigh when motorists driving along this busy motorway saw a huge flash light up the night sky on the horizon.

So far, conspiracy theories of martians and bomb-testing have emerged to explain the astonishing sight. However, the reality was far less exciting.

Bright: Some of the conspiracy theories which have surfaced online in Russia claim the flash is the result of bomb-testing or martians

The flash was the result of an 
explosion at an electrical power plant in St Petersburg, in what was 
described as a 'technical malfunction' by officials. No one was hurt in 
the incident.

The amazing footage was recorded by one driver listening to John Lennon as he was stuck in a traffic jam.

Footage has gone viral on YouTube and other blogs and social networking site, attracting a flurry of online theories from conspiracists.

'It's
 the Martians landing,' said one comment, while several others also 
suggested a spaceship had landed on Russia's second city and former 
Imperial capital.

Another commenter added: 'I know precisely what this is - tests of a neutron bomb in St Petersburg.'

'It's Vladimir Putin's new bomb - watch out,'  was another version, which brought a reply: 'We didn't have such a thing under Stalin.'

One claim was that it was 'a test of after-election therapy for the people'.

Different angle: The explosion was also captured on camera from another viewpoint - and a plume of smoke is seen rising from the power plant on the horizon

Explanation? The Russian authorities said the flash was caused by 'technical malfunctioning' which led to a temporary blackout

Russians go to the polls to choose a 
new President on March 4 following widespread complaints of ballot 
rigging by the party of favourite Putin in the December parliamentary 
elections.

In fact the explanation was more mundane.

The dramatic light show came from the latest explosion of an electricity substation in St Petersburg.

Officials blamed a 'technical malfunction' for the spectacular display without further explanations of what went wrong.

The breakdown of  small feeder power stations is by no means unusual in the former USSR, often plunging entire districts into darkness.

But as one blogger said: 'It's great they've got John Lennon on the radio. His message will not be lost.'
