The first Boeing 787 Dreamliner to touch down in the UK has arrived at Heathrow Airport.

Qatar Airways became the first airline to run a regular service in Britain using the planes which have been dubbed the worlds most advanced airliner.

Carrying an official delegation from the capital of Qatar, the aircraft landed in London from Doha.

The planes boast being more fuel-efficient than other aeroplanes but perhaps of more interest to travellers, there is anti-jetlag technology meaning people will leave long-haul flights feeling much fresher.

UK airlines including Virgin, British Airways and Thomson have also ordered Dreamliners, which are designed to carry up to 290 passengers, for their fleets.

The so-called 'green planes' boast LED 
lighting rather than harsh fluorescent bulbs, as well as bigger windows,
wider aisles and higher ceilings than the average passenger plane.

Boeing also claims the planes have cleaner cabin air, meaning those on board are less likely to become dehydrated.

The Dreamliner is also equipped with 'Smoother Ride Technology' which senses turbulence and commands wing control surfaces to counter it - offering a more comfortable flight and reducing the risk of motion sickness.

Doha-based carrier Qatar Airways expects to take 
delivery of two further Dreamliners later this month.

It expects to have 10 of
the lightweight jets in service by the end of 2013, a reduction from 
the initial plan for 30.

Advanced: According to Boeing the Dreamliner can fly 52 per cent further, burning 20 per cent less fuel, and saving more than 30 per cent on annual maintenance costs compared with existing aluminium machines

The ceremony surrounding the Qatar Airways inaugural Dreamliner flight between Doha and London was somewhat marred when the airline was forced to ground another of its three 787s due to a fault.

It was the same fault that recently forced a United Airlines Dreamliner to make an emergency landing, the airline's CEO Akbar Al Baker said yesterday.

'One
of our Dreamliners has the same problem that the United plane had and I
am very disappointed in Boeing,' he said.

Mr Al Baker said the firm would be demanding compensation from Boeing, and expressed concern that two airlines finding the same fault could indicate a wider systemic problem with the U.S. made jets.

Boeing UK said it was aware of the issue. 'We are working with our customer at their request', the manufacturer said in a statement.
