The U.S. may be buckling under a deepening economic crisis but art lovers are set to splash hundreds of millions of dollars on collectable works over two weeks in New York.

The November auction season started at Christie's on Wednesday in Manhattan with one of Monet's most famous paintings being sold for $44million (£25.5million) while a Kandinsky fetched an artist's record of $23million (£15million) – but it was not all good news as many works were left unsold.

French impressionist Monet's iconic water lilies paintings, 'Nympheas' which was painted in the early 1900s while the impressionist was living in Giverny in northern France reached the middle of its estimate and was one of the most high profile pieces that went under the hammer at Christie's.

Meanwhile, Wassily Kandinsky's ‘Studie 
fur Improvisation 8,’ reached the the low end of its $20million-$30million (£12.5million - 
£18.8million) estimate, and set a new auction record for the Russian 
artist. The vibrant work was being sold by Switzerland's Volkart 
Foundation.

But the sales were not a complete success with 30 per cent of the 69 works on offer failing to sell or reach their reserve price.

In total the auction took in a total of just under $205million (£128.6million), missing the low pre-sale estimate of about $210.7million (£131.8million).

But the auction house said it was pleased with the results. Brooke Lampley, head of Impressionist and modern art at Christie’s said: ‘It was very, very strong sale, with great results.

‘Classic Impressionism performed really well tonight.’

Officials privately attributed the relatively high percentage of works that failed to sell - nearly one third - chiefly to a single collection whose owner was unwilling to lower the reserve prices in the days leading up to the sale.

In all, six lots sold for more than $10million (£6.2million) each. Other highlights included Miro's 'Peinture (Femme, Journal, Chien), which went for $13.75million (£8.6 million), and Picasso's ‘Buste de femme,’ and oil on canvas that at $13.1million (£8.2million) was one of the few works to beat its pre-sale estimate comfortably.

Proceeds from the Monet sale will benefit a private prep school in Tarrytown, New York, which received the work in a bequest.

High expectations: Nature morte aux tulips by Pablo Picasso is expected to command a lot of attention

Up for sale: Andy Warhol's painting of the Statue of Liberty is up for auction in New York

On Thursday, the world’s richest collectors will head two miles north-east across Manhattan to Sotheby’s Impressionist and modern art sale.

More than 60 lots there include nine works by Picasso, led by paintings of his lover Marie-Therese Walter. 

Nature morte aux tulipes carries an estimate of up to $50million (£31.4million) while Femme a la Fenetre could fetch up to $20million (£12.5million).

It has been suggested that the 
economic downturn is pushing investors, including increasingly wealthy 
new buyers from Russia and China, towards canvas rather than stocks.

Iconic: The Screaming Pope painting by Francis Bacon

Going under the hammer: No 1 (Royal Red and Blue) by Mark Rothko

The New York auctions move on next week to sales of contemporary and post-war art with equally eye-watering estimates.

Rothko's No1 (Royal Red and Blue) could fetch $50million (£31.4million) at Sotheby’s, while one of Francis Bacon’s ‘screaming pope’ paintings should sell for up to $25million (£15.7million).

Christie’s, meanwhile, is pinning its hopes on Andy Warhol’s Statue of Liberty, a 3D work expected to go for more than $35.1million (£22million).
