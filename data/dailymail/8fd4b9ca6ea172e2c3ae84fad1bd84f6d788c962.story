Savers investing in the new tax-free Super Isas are being blocked from receiving the most attractive interest rates, it has emerged.

Just days ahead of the launch of the Chancellor’s flagship savings policy, many banks and building societies are preventing customers from transferring existing Isa funds into the new top-rate, easy access accounts.

Pensioners and savers who had hoped to switch to the highest rates to boost their income could now find themselves denied the chance to make more than £500 extra a year.

Under current rules, savers can transfer up to £11,880 into a tax-free Individual Savings Account (Isa) – only half of which can be cash.

The new super-Isa, which launches on July 1, will allow savers to put in up to £15,000 a year however they want, either in cash or shares.

Customers would normally be allowed to transfer money held at rival banks and building societies into their Isa. But the huge rise in the allowance has prompted many providers to end the practice.

Nationwide, National Savings & Investments, Derbyshire, Cheshire and Skipton building societies are among those who have already slammed the door shut on Isa transfers on some accounts – and there are fears more will follow.

The lenders are saying that only new money can be invested in the super-Isa at table-topping rates of at least 1.5 per cent – worth at least £150 a year on £10,000 savings.

Savers would then have to keep nest eggs in other accounts on existing Isa rates – which average at about 1.18 per cent but are as low as 0.5 per cent.

Careful older savers who have invested the maximum allowed into a cash Isa every year since they were introduced in 1999 would have saved at least £57,540 by April 5 this year, excluding interest earned.

On an interest rate of 0.5 per cent, they would earn £512.70 on all of their tax-free savings across the year. But at the higher rate they would earn £1,088.10 – £576.60 more.

It comes just days ahead of the launch of Chancellor George Osborne's flagship savings policy

Although HM Revenue & Customs says all Isa accounts must allow customers to transfer their cash whenever they want, providers are not obliged to accept it. Sue Hannums, co-founder of Savingschampion, said: ‘With rates as low as they are, savers are absolutely desperate for a decent rate.

‘So you can understand their outrage when they see one, but which bans transfers. If you’re a building society, this is a commercial decision – it’ll simply cost you more to take on the bigger balances.’

One option for savers is to cash in some of their existing cash Isa money, put it into their bank account, and apply for the full £15,000 rate at the more generous rate. But this can be an administrative nightmare – taking weeks to complete and losing interest in the process.

Skipton Building Society said record interest in its 1.5 per cent Bonus Cash Isa had triggered its curb on access. If it allowed transfers, it would not be able to offer the rate to as many customers, it said.

NS&I, which is state-backed and guarantees 100 per cent of savers’ money, said accepting transfers into its popular 1.5 per cent Direct Cash Isa would risk breaching Government rules about how it raises money from the public.

Kevin Mountford of price comparison site Moneysupermarket said: ‘We have created a savings wilderness, where banks and building societies simply don’t want savers’ cash. It means consumers need to be much more aggressive and change on even the smallest interest rate difference – even half a percentage point.

‘My concern is that unhappy savers hunting for higher rates will end up taking on more risk with a retail bond, say, or peer to peer, and won’t get the protection they want or need.’

Meanwhile, providers continue to cut rates for new savers. Newcastle Building Society has trimmed the rate on its cash Isa from 1.25 per cent to 1 per cent. Yorkshire Building Society’s e-Isa and Instant Isa is falling to 1 per cent from 1.25 per cent next month.
