Threat: Primary school teacher Sangita Naik told seven-year-old's she would 'bury them in the woods' if they did not behave

A primary school teacher has been suspended after she allegedly warned pupils she would ‘bury them in the woods’ if they did not behave.

Sangita Naik is also said to have threatened the class of mainly seven-year-olds that she would ‘put them in the boot of her car’ before placing them in a hole in the ground.

The remark is said to have been made to the whole of Mrs Naik’s Year 3 class when children were being noisy during lessons last week.

Mrs Naik, who only started at the 
primary school in September, is currently suspended while senior staff 
carry out an investigation.

Kerri
Oehme, 33, reported the incident after her seven-year-old daughter, 
Neve, came home upset. She said: ‘I am all for strict teachers as in my 
opinion they get more done with the children they are teaching.

‘It
is one thing to be strict, but making threats to pupils that leave them
in fear is not on – it is disgusting. I think Mrs Naik took it too far 
with what she said – it was intimidation.’

Mrs
Oehme, a mother-of-three, said she thoroughly questioned her daughter 
before realising the remarks were not made in a light-hearted manner.

She added: ‘Even if this had been a joke, I certainly can’t see the funny side.

‘If
Neve had gone into school and told her teachers that I had uttered 
those words at home, social services would have been round to my house 
in a flash.’

Another parent, Stacey Knibbs, said her daughter Ashlee, aged seven, had come home crying.Mrs Knibbs, 31, who works as a trainee carer, said: ‘

They
were told: “If you don’t behave, I will bundle you into the boot of my 
car and take you into the woods, dig a hole and bury you in it”.

‘I don’t know if they were playing up at the time but there is no excuse for what was said in there.

‘Ashlee loved school, she loved her teachers and even after she split her head open last year, she was keen to be back.

'But since this happened, she had been coming up for excuses not to go to school, claiming she is ill but I know it it because she was left frightened.’

Kingsmoor Academy in Harlow, Essex, lists as one of its codes of good practice ‘magnificent manners’ and claims to offer a ‘warm, welcoming, caring and secure environment’.

Parents say the school’s head Pat Hunt claimed the comments were not meant to be taken seriously. But Mrs Naik, who is married and in her late 30s, has been suspended.

Kingsmoor Academy, which has 193 pupils, was granted academy status last year.

A school spokesman said: ‘A member of staff at Kingsmoor Academy has been suspended following allegations made against that individual.

‘We take any allegations very  seriously and an investigation is under way.’
