The hunt is on for the culprits who sprayed four buildings at a Sydney high school with the phrases 'ISIS R coming' and 'ISIS beheads'.

On Wednesday morning, East Hills Boys High School staff contacted police after making the terrifying find. 

A NSW Police spokesman told Daily Mail Australia the vandals would have broken into the Lucas Road school between 6pm on Tuesday and 7.30am on Wednesday.

But this is not the first time Panania's East Hills Boys High School - in Sydney's south-west - has been at the centre of a police investigation.

A few weeks ago, Australian Federal Police officers came to the school to look into reports that a student had fled to the Middle East to join fighters of terror group Islamic State, The Daily Telegraph reported.

It followed an incident in June where two students refused to stand up and sing the Australian national anthem, saying they only stood up for 'Allah', according to 7News. 

The two teenagers were believed to have associations with Hamdi Al Qudsi who was charged last year for recruiting fighters to travel to Syria.

It also emerged that a person in contact with the Sydney man was also running worship groups inside the school attended by students, which sparked the NSW Department of Education to re-jig its policies.

The graffiti has since been removed by the school as officers from the Bankstown Local Area Command canvassed neighbouring premises on Wednesday, the police spokesman said.

Parents of East Hills Boys High School have spoken out about their concerns.

'If this is in my son's school, it's very concerning to me,’ Liz Oddy told 7News.

Vandals also got inside buildings and made threats against Australia on a whiteboard

Another parent Wadad Haidar echoed her comments.

'It's actually scaring all my kids because I've got four of them and they all go to school,' she said.

Bankstown LAC's Inspector Scott McAlpine urged anyone with information about the incident to contact police, while the school's principal, Kevin Elgood, wrote to parents saying their sons' safety was their 'highest priority'.
