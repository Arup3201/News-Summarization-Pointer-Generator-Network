Paul Scholes said England should try and copy Liverpool’s system, but the difference with Liverpool is they always have short passing options in midfield.

On Friday night in the first half there was too big a gap between Steven Gerrard, Jordan Henderson and the front four. If you have two midfielders sitting then you need five or 10-yard passing options in front of them to move the ball quickly.

Gerrard sat deep, as his touch map below shows, but Henderson did not bomb forward as often as he does for his club.

There were moments of quality — Daniel Sturridge’s goal was outstanding — and things improved in the second half but there were too many straight, long passes. England looked much better when there were more short options.

GET THE FULL BACKS FLYING

If England want to play wide midfielders that cut inside, then it’s vital Leighton Baines and Glen Johnson get further forward to provide numbers higher up. Without an overlap it’s easy for opposition defenders to stick with their man and crowd out attacks. The full backs need to give that width quickly, and Roy will hope that Baines stays fighting fit for Brazil.

THE SHAPE OF THINGS TO COME?

The side Roy Hodgson went with on Friday night could well be the team that ends up starting against Italy in Manaus.

In my experience, managers tend to pick their first XI in the first warm-up match and then use the rest of the squad in the later friendly games. Often they then revert to that first side for the tournament opener.

It happened in 1998 and again in 2002.  If Roy follows suit, don’t be surprised if the 4-2-3-1 side that started last night starts against Italy.

STARTING STERLING IS ROY'S NEXT BIG TASK

Taking Luke Shaw over Ashley Cole was Roy’s biggest selection decision so far, but now he faces another one. How can he fit Raheem Sterling into his starting line-up?

The front four did not quite click. When Rooney drops deep he needs options but there were not enough for him on Friday night.

Sterling might be used as a substitute for a tiring Rooney but the way he finished the season means he has to be a contender to start. He is such a slippery dribbler and when he came on he made things happen.
