A new law requiring motorists to remove snow and ice from their vehicles has become a new source of revenue for Connecticut.

State police are aggressively ticketing drivers who ignore the so-called 'ice missile' law.Since the law took effect Jan. 1, state police have issued at least 230 tickets to truckers and motorists who were driving snow-covered vehicles.

At $120 per summons that amounts to $27,600 in tickets in a month and a half.

The fine is $75, plus $45 in various surcharges.

Cracked: State police said they've been going after drivers who fail to clear the snow off of vehicle roofs. This is part of the state's 'ice missile' law that went into effect at the beginning of the year

Targets: Connecticut State police said they've been going after drivers who fail to clear the snow off of vehicle roofs

With 12 significant snowstorms already this winter, motorists are getting plenty of practice removing snow. The job is often complicated by freezing rain and low temperatures.

Mike Riley, president of the Motor Transport Association of Connecticut, which represents 900 companies with truck drivers, said it's hard enough to remove frozen snow and ice from a car.

Trucks, with high cabs and thin trailer roofs, are even more difficult, he said.

'We don't have a good solution to this,' he said.

On the lookout: State troopers in Connecticut and New Jersey both say they多ve written hundreds of tickets this winter season enforcing laws in each state requiring drivers to clear off their snow-covered vehicles before hitting the roads and highways

Pricey mistake: Connecticut多s law took effect Jan. 1, and troopers say they多ve already issued more than 230 summonses to drivers, with fines topping $27,000. The fine for each offense is $75,

Some companies have made available large swinging brushes to push snow off. Trucking companies have sold 200 roof rakes intended for trucks, Riley said.

'That seems to be a temporary low-tech solution,' he said. 'It's almost impossible to get all of it off, and people should not be penalized for a small amount.'

The law was passed in 2010 but was delayed to Jan. 1, 2014, to allow the public to become aware of the regulation and for trucking companies to develop ways to remove snow.

Chunks of snow and ice flying off vehicles can pose a safety hazard.

The fine for the infraction is $75. 
If snow damages a car or causes a crash, the driver could face a $200 
fine. For commercial drivers, it's even higher at $500.

Digging out: New Jersey enacted a similar law in 2010, and troopers say they多ve written hundreds of tickets this winter season. Drivers who fail to clear off their vehicles in the Garden State face fines between $25 an $75

Here we go again: With 12 significant snowstorms already this winter, motorists are getting plenty of practice removing snow -- a task often complicated by freezing rain and low temperatures
