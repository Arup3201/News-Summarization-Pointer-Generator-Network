Sometimes, coming on as a late substitute in an international football match can be difficult. And that proved the case for England midfielder Ross Barkley, who got a telling off from Roy Hodgson just seconds after entering the field of play.

'Keep it tight' will have been the message from the England manager, as Barkley came on to tighten the midfield in the latter stages of the match.

With the score at 3-1, Barkley received the ball but was unable to keep hold of it, losing possession in Scotland's favour.

That led to a furious reaction from Hodgson on the touchline, whose wild gesticulation was caught by the ITV cameras. 

Despite Barkley's mistake, England held on for a 3-1 win against their rivals north of the border. 

Everton man Barkley was making his ninth appearance for the Three Lions, after appearing in Brazil at the World Cup.

Having been injured for the start of the season, he made his comeback to club football in October, and his cameo appearance for England on Tuesday was his first for his country since the World Cup.
