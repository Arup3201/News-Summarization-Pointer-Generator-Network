A woman who is accused of brutally stabbing a University of Houston professor to death with her stiletto heel is claiming she killed in the 59-year-old in self defense after he attacked her.

Professor Alf Stefan Andersson was found with 10 wounds in his head ranging from an inch to an inch and a half deep and another 15 to 20 in his face, arms and neck, police revealed on Monday.Â 

Ana Lilia Trujill, 44, worked as a massage therapist and had recently moved into Andersson's luxury highrise condominium in the museum district of Houston, Texas.

When officers found her on Sunday night, she was covered in blood. Andersson's body was nearby.

KTRK-TV reports that Trujill, a Mexican national, had previously threatened to hit anyone who 'messed with her' with her stiletto heel.

She told police that Andersson had grabbed her and that a fight ensued. She ended it with her stiletto.

Dr Andersson, worked at the University of Houston Center for Nuclear Receptors and Cell Signaling where he focused on women's reproductive health. He'd been with the university since 2009.

'The
University of Houston community is saddened to learn of the tragic 
death of Professor Stefan Andersson. Our hearts go out to his 
colleagues, family and friends during this difficult time,' the 
university said in a statement released today.

Jim Carroll, who managed the downtown Houston motel where Trujill used to live, said he wasn't surprised by the strange weapon Trujill used.

'Twice she told me if anybody ever messed with her, she pulled her shoe off and said, 'I'd get them with this,' and it was a big stiletto heel,' Carroll told KTRK.

According to authorities, police were
called to the Parklane Building - a luxury condominium building popular
amongst professors at the nearby university - in the 1,700 block of 
Herman Drive in Houston's Theater District about 4 a.m. Sunday in 
response to an assault in progress.

Her boyfriend was found lying on the floor. She is now being held on $100,000 bond

When
police got to the 18th floor condo, Trujillo opened the door and let 
officers into the unit, which is where they found Andersson in a hallway
between the entryway and the kitchen.

Authorities say he was stabbed multiple times, each time, apparently, with a stiletto shoe.

Trujillo was the only one present when the body was discovered.

Houston police tell ABC13 that
Trujillo initially was cooperative with detectives, but later stopped 
talking as she was taken to a precinct for additional questioning.

Investigators
say Trujillo doesn't live in the building and appears to have just been
visiting. Hotel staff told authorities she appears to have arrived last
night.

A motive for the slaying is unclear.

Trujillo
is scheduled to be in Harris County District Court on Tuesday for her 
initial appearance. She currently is being held on $100,000 bond.
