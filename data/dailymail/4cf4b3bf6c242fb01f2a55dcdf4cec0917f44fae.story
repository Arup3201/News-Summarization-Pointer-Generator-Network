The police officer who shot and killed an unarmed black teenager last weekend sparking race riots was injured in the incident, a police chief has said.

The officer, who has not been named, shot 18-year-old Michael Brown dead in Ferguson, Missouri but is said to have been hospitalized himself after the shooting, suggesting there was a struggle.

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said the unidentified officer was treated for swelling on the side of his face after the incident on Saturday.

Stand-off: Riot police watch as protests over Michael Brown's shooting continue for a four successive night

Police urged protestors to only rally in daylight hours, but the demonstrations turned violent after nightfall

Smoke bombs and tear gas were thrown at rioters by police officers in Ferguson, Missouri 

But Jackson added that he could not reveal any more information about the shooting, which police say followed a struggle between the officer and Brown.

The lack of information from police has fueled escalating tensions between protestors and officers, with witnesses insisting their was no contact between Brown and the officer before he was shot.

One witness who was walking with Brown at the time has said that the deceased put his hands in the air and did not struggle with or provoke the officer.

He said the officer then fired multiple bullets into Brown's head and chest.

Michael Brown, 18, was shot dead by an unidentified police officer on Saturday night. A witness says Brown did not provoke the officer but was shot multiple times in the head and chest 

The armed officer's name has not been released for his own safety and has been placed on administrative leave, the police say, 

Another officer wrongly accused on social media of taking part in the shooting  has been evacuated from the city along with his family.

Police also confirmed that hackers had tried to access their internal website in the hope of finding the officer's name, but were unsuccessful. 

Four nights of tense standoffs between protesters and heavily armed police followed the shooting, but they have bubbled over into rioting and looting.

Ferguson police has drafted in armed officers from neighboring forces to try to quell the growing violence.

Jackson urged protesters to rally only in daylight hours, but more than 500 people broke the curfew last night, chanting: 'Hands up! Don't shoot!'

After repeatedly asking them to disperse last night, the riot police fired tear gas into the crowd to break it up, causing scenes that resembled a war zone as another night of clashes was sparked between authorities and furious protestors.

The protestors that stayed out entered into pitched street battles with police and lobbed Molotov cocktails at the camouflage-clad officers who responded with more tear gas and smoke bombs.

There were no immediate reports of injuries but at least 18 people were arrested overnight.

Civil rights activists and the attorney for Brown's family have all pressed for calm amid the nights of unrest since Brown's death.

However, they say that knowing the officer's name may help the area to heal, allowing the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and others to dig into the officer's background for any prior brutality. 

'We don't want anyone's life threatened. If someone like this officer is killed, then there is no justice,' said John Gaskin III of St. Louis County's NAACP chapter.

Police have said the shooting happened after an officer encountered 18-year-old Michael Brown and another man on the street.
