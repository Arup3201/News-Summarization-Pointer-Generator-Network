Few people can say they have laid eyes on Australia's iconic, soft and sleepy marsupials and not wanted a cuddle.

But one koala-obsessed former fashion designer has taken her love for the animals a step further by promising to release a perfume that will allow you to smell like one.

U.S.-born fashion blogger and critic Diane Pernet is planning a perfume inspired by the marsupials' eucalyptus scent.

The American born former fashion designer's social media pages's are scattered with koala pictures and news

The Paris-based filmmaker's love for the Australian animal is evident across her Instagram and Twitter pages which are scattered with photos, caricatures and the latest news of them.

But her true dedication to koalas was revealed in an interview with Women's Wear Daily, in which she announced a fragrance including eucalyptus - the mainstay of koalas' diet - was in the works.

Her plans include donating a portion of any profits made from selling the perfume to the charity to the Save The Koala.

But problems have already arisen, starting with the powerful aroma of eucalyptus.

'It's far too strong, and it smells kind of like medication. It's a difficult material to work with, but I'm sure we'll arrive at something good,' Pernet said.

During her last visit to Australia in September, Pernet said she got to hold a koala in Perth called Sunshine 

'I am so in love with koalas! I've always had a thing for them. Growing up, I had a friend from Sydney, and we would all have toy koalas on the end of our pencils,' she said

She described how her love for koalas reaches back to her childhood and was reinforced by her latest visit to Australia in September last year

'I am so in love with koalas! I've always had a thing for them. Growing up, I had a friend from Sydney, and we would all have toy koalas on the end of our pencils.

'Then, the last time I was in Perth, Australia, I said I'd only go if I could hold a koala because it's been a dream since childhood. So I got to hold one called Sunshine, and I was so surprised by how heavy she was.'

In September last year, Pernet launched her first fragrance collection made up of four scents named To Be Honest, Wanted, Shaded, and In Pursuit of Magic.

However complications have already admittedly arisen in the creation of the perfume: 'It's far too strong, and it smells kind of like medication. It's a difficult material to work with,' the filmmaker said
