Both David and Samantha Cameron were left red-faced when they accidentally left their eight-year-old daughter Nancy in the pub.

But the Prime Minister's wife has revealed it was in fact her who was responsible for the mistake after failing to check the female toilets.

The couple drove off from The Plough Inn in Cadsden, Buckinghamshire, in separate cars - both believing Nancy was with with the other.

Whoops: David Cameron, pictured holding his daughter Nancy at a wedding in 2007, thought Samantha Cameron had all their children but she thought Nancy was with him

The Prime Minister was driven back to Chequers, which is two miles from the pub, with protection officers in one car, while Mrs Cameron drove their other children in another.

Mr Cameron presumed that Nancy was in the car with his wife, while she thought that their daughter had jumped in with the Prime Minister.

But when they arrived at Chequers, they realised Nancy was no where to be found and Mrs Cameron rushed back to the pub to pick her up.

Mrs Cameron said: 'It was my fault. I was doing a sweep of gloves, hats, and I forgot to sweep the loos where she was.'

She collected her daughter from the pub 15 minutes later to find her happily helping out the pub staff.

A Downing Street spokesman said at the time: 'Thankfully when they phoned the pub she was there safe and well.'

They added the Camerons take full responsibility for looking after their children and were not blaming security officers for failing to ensure that Nancy was with the party before returning to Chequers.

'They are their children and they take responsibility for them,' said the spokeswoman.

'No-one is going to face disciplinary action. This was an error.'

The incident has since become a running joke, with the Prime Minister recently quipping that his daughter Nancy wants to be an Olympian so that she can run after the family car next time she's left in the pub.

Don't leave your children: The tongue in cheek 
message to David Cameron left at The Swan pub near Chequers, the Prime 
Minister's country retreat in Buckinghamshire

The couple's local Swan Pub, near his
country retreat at Chequers, now has a poster which says 'Please ensure
you have all your children with you when you leave'.

In an interview with Vogue magazine, 
Mrs Cameron admitted she relies on lists to help her remember things, 
adding: 'After four children, I forget everything.'

Mrs Cameron, who works two days a week as as creative consultant at luxury stationers Smythson, has two other children with the prime minister, Elwen, six, and Florence, 23 months.

The Cameronsâ€™ other son, Ivan, who suffered from cerebral palsy and epilepsy, died aged six in 2009.

Mrs Cameron also confessed that she admires the Duchess of Cambridge Kate Middleton's fashion sense and is also a lover of her signature nude high heels.

The Duchess is often spotted in a pair of the nude shoes from high street chain LK Bennett but Mrs Cameron added her main fashion icons are her two grandmothers.
