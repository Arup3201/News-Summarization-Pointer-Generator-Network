Two men who tried to smuggle almost half a ton of heroin into the UK by packing it into a specially-designed Jaguar have been jailed.

Nearly £40million worth of the Class A drug was found hidden in the luxury vehicle when it was searched by officers from the National Crime Agency (NCA) last year.

Investigators found 230kg of the 'high-purity' drug crammed into almost every available space in the car, including the rear seats, dashboard, central console and spare wheel compartment.

Noman Qureshi, 32, of Bradford, West Yorkshire, was jailed for 21 years and Israr Khan, 35, of Luton, Bedfordshire, was given an 18-year sentence after being found guilty of conspiracies to import and supply heroin. 

Police said that they were part of an international crime group who were planning to import the heroin, which, if cut and sold, would have had an estimated street value of £37.2million. 

Unaware that they were being watched by the NCA, Qureshi drove the car from his home to Luton to pick up Khan before travelling to Essex, east London in December last year.

The Jaguar, which had been shipped to the UK from Pakistan, was due to be delivered to a repairer in north London but Qureshi called the delivery driver and told him to take it to a garage in Dagenham instead.

NCA investigators watched as the car arrived at the garage during the early hours of December 7.

Qureshi and Khan left the scene but were arrested later that morning as they drove through Luton. The Jaguar was seized from the garage forecourt.

Specialist Border Force search officers found 316 packages of heroin with a total weight of 507lb (230kg).

After the hearing, NCA branch commander David Norris said: 'These men were part of an international crime group planning to import hundreds of kilos of high-purity heroin to the UK.

'It was a quite remarkable smuggling attempt. The car in which the drugs were hidden had virtually every spare bit of space filled with heroin. Crucial parts of the vehicle, like electrics, had been removed to create more room.

'But NCA investigators were one step ahead and managed to prevent these harmful drugs making it on to the streets.'

Another man, Mohammed Safder, 45, from East Ham, east London, was found not guilty of the same offences.
