The number of people killed by Ebola has reached almost 7,000 as it emerged the World Health Organisation has missed ambitious targets to contain the deadly disease.

The death toll currently stands at 6,928, according to the U.N. health agency, with the total number of people infected with the killer virus having surpassed 16,000.

The figures, released today, come almost two months after the World Health Organisation (WHO) launched an ambitious plan to stop the outbreak in West Africa - by aiming to isolate 70 per cent of the victims in the three hardest-hit countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone by December 1.

The health agency had launched an ambitious plan to stop the outbreak in West Africa - by aiming to isolate 70 per cent of the victims in the three hardest-hit countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone by tomorrow

New data shows there have been a total of 16,169 cases in those three countries alone, and approximately three dozen cases elsewhere.

Liberia has recorded the highest number of cases and deaths, but the rate of infection is currently slowing there. In contrast, the disease is now spreading fastest in Sierra Leone.

Out of the three West African countries, only Guinea is on track to meet the December 1 goal, according to an update from WHO.

In Liberia, only 23 per cent of cases are isolated and 26 per cent of the required burial teams are in place.

In Sierra Leone, about 40 per cent of cases are isolated while 27 per cent of burial teams are prepared and ready.

With the target date of tomorrow looming, it is almost certain WHO's goals will be missed - marking another failure in attempts to slow the biggest-ever outbreak of the deadly disease.

The outbreak of Ebola was first reported in Guinea in March and spiralled out of control after being declared a public health emergency in August.

Dr. Bruce Aylward, who is directing the World Health Organisation's response to Ebola, acknowledged in October that reaching the December 1 goal would be 'really pushing the system hard.'

Failure to meet the targets marks further problems in attempts to slow the biggest-ever outbreak of the virus

The disease is now spreading fastest in Sierra Leone, where there has been a severe surge in cases recently

He said: 'If we don't do it in 60 days and we take 90 days: No. 1, a lot more people will die that shouldn't; and No. 2, we will need that much more capacity on the ground to be able to manage the caseload.'

In recent weeks, there have been some successes in curbing the deadly disease, with cases in Liberia and Guinea appearing to be declining or stabilising. However, the areas around Sierra Leone's capital and a district in the country's north are seeing a severe surge in cases.

The December 1 targets had been met in many places - but not all, which was the goal, said Anthony Banbury, who is heading the U.N.'s Ebola response.

'There are still going to be many people who catch the disease and many people who die from it,' he said.

Even if the December 1 targets had been reached, WHO and others had predicted Ebola would continue infecting people in West Africa and possibly elsewhere until sometime next year.

Oyewale Tomori, of Redeemer's University in Nigeria, who sits on WHO's Emergency Ebola committee, said failing to reach the  target now suggests Ebola will spread even further as capacities to respond become even more stretched.

'We need to redouble our efforts to see what we can do to reduce the spread and catch up with the virus,' he said. 

'Right now, it doesn't look good.'

Earlier this month, the U.S. announced it was scaling back the size and number of Ebola clinics it had initially promised to build in Liberia, citing a drop in cases. The WHO now plans to isolate all patients by January 1

December 6, 2013 - Ebola claims the life of its first victim in Guinea, thought to be a two-year-old from a remote village. The toddler, scientists believe was patient zero, suffered a fever, black stools and vomiting.

March 25, 2014 - The Guinean authorities report the outbreak to the World Health Organisation after diagnosing the virus as Ebola. By this stage deaths from the virus was still confined to Guinea.

May 2014 - It appeared as though the outbreak may be slowing, as the death toll tailed off.

May 2014 - A very well-known woman from Guinea, a traditional medical practitioner and leader of a secret society died from the virus, Professor Piot said. Hundreds of people attended her funeral, travelling from three countries - Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. Dozens were infected and the disease spread across Guinea's southern border to both neighbouring nations.

July 2014 - The virus crossed into Nigeria as Liberian man Patrick Sawyer died en route back to the US. He had been at the funeral of his sister, who died of Ebola.

August 8, 2014 - The WHO declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.

Other experts said the WHO goals were never very significant.

Sebastian Funk, director of the centre for the mathematical modelling of infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: 'You want to isolate 100 per cent of patients with Ebola and have 100 per cent safe burials.

'Getting to 70 per cent doesn't really mean a lot.'

Dr. David Heymann, an Ebola expert who previously worked for the WHO, said: 'We hope that what we're seeing in Liberia will continue, but unfortunately what can happen with Ebola is that it can go to new countries, as it has already to Mali.

'The most dangerous thing would be if people now think Ebola is over and become complacent.'

Earlier this month, the U.S. announced it was scaling back the size and number of Ebola clinics it had initially promised to build in Liberia, citing a drop in cases.

Mr Banbury said the critical gap in those locations were new beds and that ending Ebola would be a long, hard fight.

'We're by no means out of the woods yet, but we're headed in the right direction,' he said.

The ultimate goal of WHO's plan now is to isolate all Ebola patients and provide safe burials by January 1.
