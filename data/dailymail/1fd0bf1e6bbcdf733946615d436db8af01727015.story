The past nineteen years have been difficult for Karta the Sumatran orang-utan - she's had a stillbirth and seen four of her infants die.

But Adelaide Zoo staff are hoping this time her baby joy will not be marred with tragedy.

On Tuesday, the zoo's senior primate keeper Jodie Ellen announced Karta was expecting, with the baby due in late November.

After the death of her fourth baby in 2011, zookeepers found out Karta had trouble breastfeeding because of an anatomical issue.

'The little one passed away four days (after its birth) and when we performed a post-mortem, we found it had passed away from an infection, but we also discovered there was no milk in its stomach,' zoo spokeswoman Alison Hassel said.

'That led to the eventual discovery that she had issues breastfeeding and why infants have not survived because they were not getting food.'

Steps have now been taken to ensure supplementary milk is deliver to new babies, and staff are hopeful her latest bub will have a better chance of surviving.

'We're extremely pleased Karta is pregnant and has the opportunity to become a mum again, something we believe she greatly deserves,' Ms Ellen said.

'Nothing is being taken for granted and we are hoping this time around Mother Nature will give us a chance to put our supplementary feeding program into practice and give her every chance of a successful outcome.

Karta is 31 years old and has been living at Adelaide Zoo since 1992 after coming from San Diego Zoo

'At this point we believe Karta is physically, mentally and emotionally ready to try again and we ask the community for support and understanding as we head into the next part of this journey.'

An infant was stillborn in January last year, while four other babies died soon after birth since 1995.

Ms Ellen said Karta's difficulty with breastfeeding her infants may have contributed to her inability to raise them in the past.

'Since then we've put the same training into place in the hopes that we will also be able to supplement feed future offspring and give Karta the opportunity to become a successful mother,' she said.

The technique used at Adelaide Zoo is modelled on another at Denver Zoo, where a Sumatran orangutan was having similar issues.

Later it was discovered the orangutan at Denver Zoo was Karta's sister, with staff hypothesising the breast feeding difficulty was genetic.

Ms Hassel said the technique involved a fake nipple being attached to a garden hose with a syringe on the other end where supplementary milk can be passed through so the baby is able to be held in its mother's arms while eating.

Karta, 31, has been at the zoo since 1992, while Kluet - the expected baby's father - turns 19 next month and arrived at the zoo in 2007.

The most recent estimates indicate there are as few as 6,300 wild Sumatran Orangutans left.

It's estimated 50 are lost a week, due to the destruction of their natural habitat primarily because of the clearing of land for logging and palm oil plantations.
