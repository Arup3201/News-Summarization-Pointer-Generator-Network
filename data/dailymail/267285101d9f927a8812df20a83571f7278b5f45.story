Slovenian Blaz Mahkovic scored a sensational basket for Union Olimpija Ljubljana from behind the baseline as his side beat Partizan Belgrade in the Adriatic League.

Olimpija were well on their way to a fine victory over Partizan Belgrade when Mahkovic turned on the style.

The forward latched on to a missed three-pointer by his team-mate before the ball went out of play and fired in a shot.

Olimpija's forward Blaz Mahkovic was the first to react to the miss and ran towards the ball behind the endline

The 24-year-old managed to turn, get a grip on the ball and keep his feet off the floor in one motion as he looped the ball over the backboard and into the net from a ridiculous angle from behind the baseline.

Mahkovic’s Olimpija side were already coasting at 21 points up on their opponents and eventually ran out 87-58 winners.

The victory lifted Olimpija up to third in the Adriatic Basketball League but with skills like that, perhaps Mahkovic will end up in the NBA.
