It was what Roy Hodgson hopes will become the old one-two. Raheem Sterling set it up, Wayne Rooney tucked it away. From the penalty spot, admittedly — but they all count. Certainly when a team has as much catching up to do as England.

There is no point wallowing in the torpor that currently surrounds the national team, that backdrop of sighs and shrugs and whatevs that has haunted the group since Brazil.

Yes, the new European Championship qualification process is boring. Yes, Roy Hodgson’s England team have been largely uninspiring. No, it won’t get any better in the next two seasons, until England meet strong opposition at the finals in France. We just have to be make the best of it until then.

And while this wasn’t the best by any stretch of the imagination, there were glimpses, tiny reminders that, let off the leash, England do have some players worth watching.

Chief among them, without doubt, is Raheem Sterling, who was the best player on the night, and could be among the finest in Europe one day. That his attacking verve created the goal for Rooney was no more than he deserved.

Did Rooney deserve it? This wasn’t his greatest game, it must be said. Yet it was the game of a new captain itching to lead from the front and there was never any question over who would take the penalty. The skipper assumed the responsibility with relish and delivered what proved to be the winning goal in much the same fashion.

This was hardly a fresh beginning but, in the circumstances, how could it be? Wembley was half-empty, if that, and Norway were uninspiring yet grimly cussed opponents — hard in the tackle and defending in deep banks as if a point was needed to qualify for a tournament of significance.

Equally, this is an England manager and team still recovering from their earliest World Cup exit in half a century. Faults remain. The defence looks vulnerable to pressure and at times England’s build-up is ponderous. Several players often fail to replicate their club performances, and chances are frequently wasted. Rooney’s penalty was England’s first shot on target, and it came after 68 minutes.

Reasons to be cheerful? They invariably start, as expected, with Sterling. He is already among the most promising teenagers in Europe and if Hodgson can harness his Liverpool form, England have a genuine match-winner. 

Danny Welbeck came on and forced the best save of the night from Norway goalkeeper Orjan Haskjold Nyland and Daniel Sturridge had a couple of near misses in the first half. But it is fair to say that most that was good about England came through Sterling, and any breakthrough was likely to come from him.

As it eventually did. Already the star of England’s show, it was Sterling’s determined running, in the face of some very close attention, that turned what would have been one very damp squib into a happier affair. 

There wasn’t much on when Sterling committed Omar Elabdellaoui on the left side of the penalty area, but he did enough to worry his man into diving in with an ill-judged and clumsy outstretched leg. Sterling was brought to the floor, referee Jorge Sousa pointed to the spot and Rooney collected the ball greedily. He is no fool. He knew this was his chance to change the narrative.

There are some who would not have England’s captain in the starting line-up, but the way he simply leathered the ball into the top left corner of the goal was an emphatic statement. Damn the low-key surrounds, damn the low-key occasion. Rooney had talked of this as his moment and here he demonstrated a truly desperate desire to take it.

He was substituted two minutes later, no doubt to protect him for the bigger match in Basle on Monday. Did he have a great game? Not really. Did he catch the eye? Hardly. Was Welbeck more of a handful in his brief substitute appearance? Yes. Will Rooney play against Switzerland? Definitely.

Hodgson will recall one of Rooney’s previous visits there, under Fabio Capello. It was among his finest games for England in recent years. If this rekindles those memories and sends him to Switzerland in a positive frame of mind, Hodgson will settle for that. 

Yet it is Sterling, not Rooney, who the Swiss will be eyeing after this. England do not have so many world beaters that he does not stand out.

Other good news about this England era? Certainly, journey times to Wembley have improved. With just over 40,000 inside, the North Circular at rush hour no longer resembles, well, the North Circular at rush hour. It takes no time to get here now, and you can probably get parked, too, considering many of the people in the stadium are not allowed to take holidays out of term time, let alone drive a car.

There is also greater connection with the players, the fans now able to hear many of their cries on the pitch. Hodgson gave forceful instructions to his defence, Leighton Baines shouted in pain after a late tackle. Jack Wilshere’s conversation with referee Sousa after he had been denied a blatant penalty following a foul by Havard Nordtveit is probably best left unrecorded, though.

It wasn’t the worst England performance, but it was not much to get excited about and the anaemic atmosphere was a burden. We are used, even in difficult times, to decent crowds at the rebuilt Wembley Stadium. Seeing it like this, the top tier all but closed, Club Wembley even emptier than usual, the lower tier full but strangely unmoved, gave the whole event an empty, unsatisfying air.

For the television viewer there would have been considerably more tension during the Great British Bake Off on BBC2, certainly if somebody’s ice cream got left on the formica top by mistake again.

Norway were not tame opponents, they were certainly well organised, but Switzerland will have a lot more about them going forward, particularly at home. Nevertheless, Hart was forced into a superb save from Joshua King after 50 minutes and was almost caught out when Per Ciljan Skjelbred struck a cross from the right in the first half. Hart scrambled back a couple of steps, but failed to take the ball cleanly, only gathering it at the second attempt. It would have been a thoroughly depressing moment had that gone in, and a defeat in Basle could still turn apathy into mutiny back home.

England had the best chances of the first half, mostly created by Sterling who put in Sturridge twice, plus Baines, without success. It was, in essence, a repeat of the issues at the World Cup; England had the possession and the opportunities but lacked the touch of class required to convert them. It is a long road back from here, and not much scenery either.
