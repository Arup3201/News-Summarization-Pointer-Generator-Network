In the seductive film, Abbey showcases Ultimo’s latest designs, as well as a darker hair colour and matching sultry look.

The
 Liverpudlian model is seen posing in six different lingerie looks from 
the new AW14 collection on a bed and in a library in the new video.

Michelle
 Mone OBE, creator of Ultimo, said: 'The film perfectly encapsulates the
 essence of the brand and our latest collection – beautiful, confident 
and luxurious.

'The
 most important thing to remember when it comes to lingerie is that if 
you feel confident and sexy, you will look it no matter what you’re 
wearing. Ultimo designs are crafted with this firmly in mind, always.'

Talking 
about the latest designs, Michelle added: 
'The new Ultimo collection for autumn winter is all about the "wow"
 factor. Our classic bras have been updated with the seasonís most 
stylish prints and shades, presenting seriously sumptuous lingerie for 
women who want to look and feel fabulous.'

Abbey said: 'For me, great lingerie is 
an essential part of any outfit, and often I’ll pick my underwear before
 I decide what to wear.

'I’ve
 totally fallen in love with the new Ultimo collection. It looks and 
feels incredibly premium, and the fit is unbelievable.'

Abbey's latest collection comes amidst recent reports of issues between Abbey and Michelle after the model posed in lingerie for brands Veet and Scholl.

Reports
 back in May said the situation had become tense, dubbing it’ bra wars’,
 but at the time Michelle tweeted: 'Unfortunately we had exclusivity 
issue with Abbey's mgmt, she's a great girl. We look forward to 
releasing her last campaign.'

However,
 the release of these latest shots, confirm Abbey is still the face of 
the brand and is revelling in being the face and body of Ultimo.

An Ultimo spokesperson confirmed to the MailOnline that Abbey was still under contract until the end of 2014.

Abbey first became an ambassador for the brand in December 2013, when she replaced Michael Buble's wife Luisana Lopilato.

The
 Strictly Come Dancing winner is currently supporting Macmillan Cancer 
Support's Shave Or Style campaign, which calls on the public to don a 
new do' to help those affected by cancer. 

Abbey wore a punky black wig in support of the campaign, shot by photographer Rankin.

She
 said at the time: 'Shave or Style is all about recognising that changes
 to our appearance doesn't just change how we look, but also how we 
feel.

'Many
 of us know someone who has been affected by cancer and who will have 
gone through these changes, so I'm delighted to be helping to raise 
awareness for this great campaign.'
