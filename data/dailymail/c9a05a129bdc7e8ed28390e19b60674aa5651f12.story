A 28-year-old math teacher has pleaded not guilty to sexually assaulting three male students at a California school.

Melissa Nicole Lindgren is accused of sexually assaulting students at Nicolas Junior High School in Fullerton, where she worked for six years before her arrest in February.

The victims, ranging in age from 13 to 15 years old, claim the teacher molested them and sent them sexually explicit texts.

Lindgren is charged with five counts of lewd acts on a child, two counts of lewd acts on a child younger than 14 and three counts of distributing pornography to a minor in incidents that occurred both on campus and off.

She was arrested on school grounds on February 21 after one of the victims reported being sexually assaulted to the Fullerton Police Department and released on $100,000 bail.

According to the Los Angeles Times, Lindgren is accused of sexually touching and kissing one boy in her classroom, a second boy on the school campus and a third student in her car.

She also sent sexual text messages to all three the boys, say prosecutors. Â 

The incidents occurred between 2012 and 2014.

'The students, parents, faculty and staff of Fullerton School District came together to overcome the difficulties surrounding the acts of this teacher,' Superintendent Bob Pletka said in a prepared statement.

'This matter is now being addressed by the judicial system, and we trust that justice will be served.'

Students told KTLA that the allegations didn't come as a surprise.

'She was a great teacher, she was really nice,' said one. 'It surprisingly didn't really surprise me. She used to be a little flirty sometimes with the other male students... She would joke about going on some dates with students.'

Another student said Lindgren would make risque jokes and say 'the b-word' in class. 'She was trying to be cool with the kids.'

If convicted, Lindgren faces a maximum sentence of 16 years and four months in prison and will be forced to enter the sex offenders registry.

Lindgren's next court date is June 13.
