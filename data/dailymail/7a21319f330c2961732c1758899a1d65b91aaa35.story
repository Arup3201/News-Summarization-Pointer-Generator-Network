Thousands of favourite British garden plants and flowers could be banned from sale at garden centres under new EU proposals.

The popular lavender Lavandula Hidcote, the highly scented iris Jane Phillips, the holly shrub known as Ilex Golden King and the pink star-shaped clematis Nelly Moser are among those at risk. 

A European Commission shake-up of plant legislation proposes that in future each plant variety must be given a detailed scientific description – as well as being listed on an official plant register.

But the UK does not have an official register of plants and experts say it would be too expensive and take years to set up.

As a result, unregistered plants could be removed from sale in garden centres and other shops.

The aim of the new legislation is to ensure consumers are not sold fake or inferior plants. 

But growers and  gardening experts are incensed that what was intended as a simplification of trade rules could end up with a new EU law that dictates what plants people are allowed to buy.

Anyone selling an unregistered plant could face hefty fines.

The draft legislation is demanding such detailed information about each plant variety that experts believe descriptions would be two pages long and would even have to specify the lengths of hairs on stems.

At present in the UK, the nearest thing to an official register is a list of 52,000 varieties held by the Royal Horticultural Society, the country’s leading gardening charity.

It is regarded as a plant ‘bible’ but only about 2,000 listed plants have an official botanical description.

Industry insiders say growers  and plant breeders would also be deterred by the expected high costs of registering a plant.

Some breeders who wish to sell new varieties overseas already pay £400 to £500 to private consultants who write botanical descriptions.

Charges are higher for food seeds and plants and can cost up to £1,000.

The Horticultural Trades Association is urging Environment Secretary Owen Paterson to stop the Brussels meddling.

Gary Scroby, HTA policy manager, said: ‘The EC say it’s not their intention to impose bureaucracy and cost on the industry, but the details leave it open to deliver exactly that outcome.’

Graham Spencer, who runs Plants For Europe, an agent for plant breeders, said: ‘Everyone is really worried about this.

We could lose lots of varieties. Take Lavender  Hidcote. It is one of the most  widely grown lavenders but it does not have an official recognisable description.

Growers might decide not to grow if they could not label  it as Lavender Hidcote.

‘British horticulture is all about developing unusual plants. We have a heritage of growing novel varieties.

The whole trade is driven by varieties and people like to go and buy their favourites. We are all for consumer protection but this will harm consumers and reduce consumer choice.’

Bob Brown, who runs Just Must 
Perennials and has introduced hundreds of new UK varieties, said: ‘I 
have a business based on novelty. We can’t pay to register 100 plants a 
year, it will kill the business.’

One of the most popular daffodils in the country, a variety known as Narcissus King Alfred, could also be affected.

Also at risk are the spiky scarlet flowered montbretia (Crocosmia Lucifer), a tree mallow (Lavatera Barnsley), the lavender petalled cranesbill (Geranium  Johnson’s Blue), aromatic catmint (Nepeta Six Hills Giant) and the highly fragrant mock orange (Philadelphus Belle Etoile).

Jenna Fox-Wheddon, supervisor of the garden shop at Sissinghurst Castle in Kent, said they both sell and grow Lavandula Hidcote and Geranium Johnson’s Blue in their gardens, first developed by poet and author Vita Sackville-West in the 1930s.

Both the 12th Century Cranborne Estate in Dorset and the Ness Botanic Gardens on the Wirral Peninsula grow the perfumed iris Jane Phillips. 

Vicky Ford, Tory MEP for the East of England, said: ‘This is very poorly drafted legislation. England is famous for the diversity of our gardens.

We either need to amend this completely or kick the entire proposal into the long grass – forever.’ 

A Defra spokeswoman said:  ‘We are working with other EU countries to retain simpler rules which will allow companies to  continue to sell ornamental plants and seeds without specific botanical descriptions.’

An EC health and consumer policy spokesman said: ‘There is nothing in the proposals that suggest we wish to ban anything. Our aim is to make plant sales more transparent.’
