Chis Grayling has faced criticism even from his own party over the scheme

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling is under pressure to reverse a ban on books being sent to prisoners which has been branded ‘unenlightened’ by senior Tory colleagues.

The restriction on reading material being sent to prisoners by family and friends is part of a new ‘incentives and earned privileges’ regime introduced by the Ministry of Justice.

The scheme has caused uproar among writers and civil liberties groups - one of which likened it to measures seen at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. They argue there should be no restrictions on access to books in prisons, supposed to be places of rehabilitation and education.

Even senior Conservatives who 
normally back Mr Grayling’s hardline approach are uneasy. One senior 
Tory minister said: ‘Chris Grayling wins the prize for the Government’s 
least enlightened minister. He has no backing for this from any quarter 
at all.’

The
 Justice Secretary insisted last night that parcels being sent into 
prisons had been a vehicle for ‘contraband’ and there were not enough 
staff to check them all properly. He insisted prisoners could access 
books from jail libraries and could purchase more using money earned by 
working inside.

‘Parcels
 are an obvious conduit for getting drugs into prisons. If we allowed 
all prisoners to have access to parcels from home, it would be an 
impossible volume of post to go through systematically,’ Mr Grayling 
said.

The move is part of a bigger shift towards an 'incentive and earned privileges' regime introduced by MoJ

‘What we have done is set out rules that say when people can have parcels from home. The idea that we are banning access to books for prisoners is frankly ridiculous.

‘All prisoners can have up to 12 books in their cell, and all prisons have libraries which prisoners have access to. They can buy any book they want to with their prison earnings, with the approval of prison staff.’

But Clare Algar, executive director of legal charity Reprieve said: ‘This move is reminiscent of the heavy-handed measures we have seen at Guantanamo Bay - where the US authorities have banned a wide range of books, from John Grisham to Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.

‘It is deeply disturbing to see Chris Grayling now taking his lead from one of the world’s most notorious prisons.’

Frances Crook, the director of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said banning books being sent to prisons was ‘despicable and nasty’.

‘The rules governing possessions of prisoners are arcane and not consistently applied by every prison. These new restrictions relate to a downgrading of the system of rewards and punishments, ostensibly designed to encourage prisoners to comply with prison rules.

‘If the Ministry of Justice allows prisoners to be sent credit from outside, then why on earth would they ban friends and family from sending in books and insist instead that prisoners must buy the books themselves?

‘Almost all a prisoner’s weekly allowance would be spent on just one title. Even the most ardent book lovers tend not to spend all of their weekly wage on what they read.

‘It is common for prisoners to spend 20 hours a day in their cells during the week. At weekends they can be cooped up from Friday lunchtime until Monday morning. Being able to read a book is a lifeline and a way of nourishing the mind.’

Prisons in Brazil offer inmates the chance to shorten their sentences by reading books.

Inmates in four federal jails earn four days off their time inside for every book they read, meaning they would have to work their way through 12 to trim a maximum 48 days off their sentence each year.

They are given up to four weeks to read a book and write an essay on it, which must ‘make correct use of paragraphs, be free of corrections, use margins and legible joined-up writing’. An expert panel determines which inmates are eligible to participate.

She insisted prison libraries were not a satisfactory alternative as they were run by local authorities, many of which were now seeking to cut costs.

TV historian Professor Mary Beard said: ‘I am with the excellent Howard League on this one. It just can’t be a sensible idea. Books educate and rehabilitate.’

Author Ian Rankin said: ‘From visits to prisons and talking to prisoners, I know how important books can be in promoting literacy and connecting prisoners to society.’

Labour’s shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said if the Government wanted to rehabilitate prisoners it ‘would be encouraging reading, not making it more difficult than it already is’.

‘Half of all male prisoners have no qualifications and the number of those in jail who can’t read and write is a national disgrace. Two-fifths of all prisoners have the average reading age of an 11-year-old,’ he added.

‘This ridiculous policy shows just how low Chris Grayling has plumbed the depths in his approach to running our justice system.’

The new regime prevents prisoners being sent parcels, previously allowed at the discretion of jail governors, except in exceptional circumstances such as for provision of medical supplies. Reform campaigners say that as well as books, other items, such as underwear and stationery, are being restricted. Inmates have to buy items from prison shops instead.

Prisons minister Jeremy Wright said: ‘Under the incentives and earned privileges scheme, if prisoners engage with their rehabilitation and comply with the regime they can have greater access to funds to buy items, including books.’
