Louis van Gaal rained on Swansea’s parade, telling the Welsh side they did not deserve to beat Manchester United 2-1.

The United boss was fuming after his side suffered only their second defeat in 20 games in all competitions, falling to goals from Ki Sung-Yueng and Bafetimbi Gomis after Ander Herrera had put the visitors ahead in the first half.

He said: ‘We created a chance every two minutes in the second half and they had one chance.

‘In the first minute of the second half Swansea had a good chance and after we were dominating the game. We were not effective. In one counter they a shot (from Jonjo Shelvey) deflected and maybe also Gomis is in an offside position. So we are not happy and not lucky.’

There was a whiff of sour grapes about Van Gaal’s review of a game in which Swansea actually had more shots on goal - six to United’s three.

Van Gaal added: ‘We dominated the game even with 10 men because Robin van Persie could not run anymore because of an injury (after United had made their last substitution).

‘It is always frustrating when you lose after dominating a team. Your disappointment is much bigger because of that.

‘It's amazing we have lost. But you do lose games. We have only lost to Southampton (since November) and when that happens we have to continue. We were the better team. But against Burnley we were not, so it's the benefit of football that the result is unpredictable. But for us it's very disappointing.’

Swansea manager Garry Monk, who has now done the double over United this season, was bemused by Van Gaal’s reaction. He said: ‘I'd rather be lucky than good. Yes we had to ride some pressure, but all their pressure amounted to one shot. We got a fantastic goal and probably could have got a third.

‘It’s the first time in the club's history (double over United). I told players before game anything in terms of creating history is worth fighting for. To be able to do the double everyone connected to club should be proud of it.'
