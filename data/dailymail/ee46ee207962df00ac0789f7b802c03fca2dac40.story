Sentenced: Paul Alton was jailed for 30 months after police found a 'bizarre' homemade weapon capable of firing rounds of exploding ammunition at his remote farm

A farmer who made a 'bizarre' gun capable of firing 74 rounds of expanding bullets has been jailed for 30 months after his frightened wife reported him to police.

The weapon was crudely constructed from lumps of wood, belts and tags, attached to a barrel from an air rifle and could shoot ammunition that would mushroom on hitting flesh.

Paul Alton, 51, claimed he kept the gun for the 'humane killing' of the cattle on his remote farm in Bacup, Lancashire.

But the father-of-two was jailed for breaching UK gun laws after police found the pistol in his loft and a shotgun under his bed despite having lost his gun licence.

Police had been called to his home after a fierce row in which 51-year-old Alton
wielded a lump hammer at his wife Kim - prompting her to tell officers 
about the hidden weapons.

The pistol, found in the loft, was described as a contraption worthy of British illustrator Heath 
Robinson who was renowned for his drawings of eccentric machines.

But
tests revealed the wooden weapon, which was attached to the barrel from
an air rifle, was capable of firing .22 ammunition and 74 rounds of 
expanding ammunition that would mushroom on hitting flesh.

Police investigations revealed that Alton had formerly owned a shotgun licence, but it had been taken away in 2000 and a reapplication to be legally allowed to use a weapon was unsuccessful.

He had been given the pistol by his uncle who used it to kill animals 
during the course of his career as a butcher.

Alton claimed he had 
the gun for the 'humane dispatch' of animals, although he had never used
it for that purpose, and said he had only kept it because of his 'magpie 
instinct'. He had test fired it twice.

At Burnley Crown Court Alton had faced a mandatory five year prison term under the current gun laws after being caught with the loaded firearms.

Bizarre: The weapon, given to Alton by his uncle, was made of wood, belts and plastic tags and was capable of firing 74 rounds of ammunition

However, he was given a reduced sentence of 30 months after Judge Beverley Lunt said the case was 'exceptional' and the pistol as 'bizarre'.

The judge said: 'It’s a weapon, it’s a gun, it can fire at anybody and it could dispatch humans.

'But you weren’t holding it for criminals and you weren’t using it for criminal purposes. Five years would be manifestly excessive althought there must be a custodial sentence.'

Earlier Mark Lamberty, prosecuting, said the firearms were discovered in April after Alton and his wife of 14 years argued at their home and he brandished a lump hammer and brought it down, striking the arm of the chair she was sitting in.

She called police and he was arrested when police stopped his car on the M65 and found a work knife in his jeans.

Deadly: The court was told that the pistol was 'extremely dangerous'

Mr Lamberty said police had found the unloaded shotgun in a bag at the farmhouse.

He said of the homemade pistol: 'It will fire and an expert was able to fire it. It is extremely dangerous and shouldn’t be done by anybody other than an expert.'

Joe Boyd, mitigating, said his client had been a farmer since the age of 16 and knew no other environment.

He
added: 'The pistol was an extremely Heath Robinson home-made type of 
weapon and it had been given to Mr Alton five or six years before by his
uncle.

Intention: Alton kept the guns at his cattle farm for the 'humane dispatch' of animals, and had 'no idea' of its significance, according to his defence lawyer (file photo)

'His intention was to use it for the humane dispatch of animals. He had no idea of the significance of the pistol.'

Alton admitted possessing a prohibited weapon - the .22 pistol, with a barrel less than 30 centimetres. He also pleaded guilty to assault and to possessing a 12 gauge single barrel shotgun and ammunition - two .22 bulleted rifle cartridges - without a firearms certificate.

He further admitted possessing expanding ammunition - 74 .22 long rifle bulleted cartridges and having an article with a blade or point - a lock knife - as well as attempting to pervert the course of justice.

Alton also received a five year restraining order, banning him from contacting his wife.
