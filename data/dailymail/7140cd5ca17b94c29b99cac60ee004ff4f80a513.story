Missile-carrying robot drones have been used for years by the U.S Army - but they’re deployed against large targets and need a runway to take off from.

Now a new YouTube video shows that in the future, drones could also carry out the close-combat duties of foot soldiers.

In the clip ‘FPSRussia’, whose Call of Duty videos and real-life weapon demonstrations have earned him a cult following, shows off a quadrotor – a mini helicopter with four rotors - outfitted with a machine gun.

Air we go: FPSRussia demonstrates a hover drone outfitted with a machine gun

The machine is controlled by a tablet computer and FPSRussia explains that a camera on front of the quadrotor gives him a ‘birds’ eye view’ of the target.

It’s capable of flying at 30mph and at an altitude of a quarter of a mile, but for the demonstration, FPSRussia takes the drone a short distance away to a group of life-size dolls positioned on a slope.

The machine gun is capable of firing 100 rounds a minute – and it’s not long before the figures are completely destroyed.

Heat is on: The clip shows the gun's muzzle flash as we see the drone's point of view

Explosive: The drone hovers over the remains of the dummies

A huge muzzle flash leaps across the screen when we see the drones’ view.

Next, FPSRussia shows off the machine’s ability to get into a tight spot and flies it through the window of a mocked-up room.

There four dummies sitting around a tablet are destroyed while FPSRussia stands by at a safe distance.

He explains that the 'prototype' he's apparently flying in the video could well be turning up in a future Call of Duty installment.
