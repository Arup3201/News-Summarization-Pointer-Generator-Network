Sir Jack Brabham, who has died aged 88, was Formula One’s first knight, and the holder of another unique distinction: he is the only man to have driven to a world title in a car he designed and built.

But even before that feat in 1966, he was assured of a place in motor-racing folklore, having pushed his car to the first of his three world titles in 1959 after running out of fuel 100 yards from the end of the US Grand Prix at Sebring. With the rules forbidding anyone else from helping him, his strong frame proved equal to the task.

Brabham’s success as a wily, combative driver, combined with his acumen as the owner of his eponymous team, elevated him to the status of sporting royalty in his native Australia. His bust is displayed at the entrance to the paddock at the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne each year.

His death 
at his house on the Gold Coast, after a long battle 
against kidney disease, was met by tributes from fellow racers from 
motor-racing’s dangerous era.

Sir
 Stirling Moss said: ‘My career would have been considerably less 
without him. Every race — and I’m talking 50-odd times a year — we would
 fight against each other.

‘I
 remember in New Zealand in the early Fifties, we were contending the 
New Zealand Grand Prix, and I had a problem with my back axle. The first
 person who came up was Jack and he said, “Take it off my spare car,” 
knowing very well that there was a good chance I might beat him.

‘That sums him up — a real sportsman and a good Aussie.’

Sir
 Jackie Stewart, whose career overlapped with Brabham’s, said: ‘He was 
an extremely talented driver and deceptively fast. He was also a very 
aggressive driver and probably one of the most difficult to overtake.’

Brabham,
 the grandson of a Cockney emigrant to Adelaide, was born in an outer 
Sydney suburb in 1926. His father was a grocer and taught Jack to drive 
as soon as he could reach the pedals. By then he had already taken an 
interest in the mechanics of his father’s trucks and cars, a fascination
 with machinery that was to endure.

After
 leaving school at 15, Brabham got a job in a local garage and studied 
engineering in the evening. He served during the war as an engineer in 
the Royal Australian Air Force and opened a motor repair shop on 
demobilisation.

Having
 first raced on dirt tracks in Australia, Brabham travelled to England 
in the mid-1950s. He won the first two of his three world titles with 
Cooper-Climax, before manufacturing his own winning car — the Brabham 
BT19 — with the help of his compatriot Ron Tauranac.

He
 was 40 by then and had been written off by many cognoscenti as past his
 best. To make this point someone sent him a long beard and walking 
stick, which he wore, as a joke against himself, on to the grid at 
Zandvoort that year before driving to victory from pole position.

It was a humorous touch from a taciturn, even shy, man.

Brabham
 won also two constructors’ championships, in 1966 and 1967. He competed
 in 126 grands prix during a 15-year F1 career, winning 14 races. He 
retired in 1970, when he was 43, bowing out after winning at Kyalami, 
South Africa. He would have continued but his first wife Betty and the 
family implored him to stop.

Picture that: Jack Brabham, at his home on the Gold Coast in 2009, will be remembered as a legend of the sport

‘Black
 Jack’, as he was called, sold the Brabham team to Tauranac yet it 
continued for 30 years, including under the ownership of Bernie 
Ecclestone, for whom Nelson Piquet won two world titles. He regretted 
severing his ties with Formula One so abruptly.

Despite
 his immense achievement, which earned him a knighthood in 1979, few 
commentators quite rank Brabham among their golden handful of finest 
drivers, alongside the likes of Jim Clark, Ayrton Senna and Juan-Manuel 
Fangio.

Longevity: Brabham's career in F1 spanned 15 seasons - he was 44 when he finally retired from the sport

But
 it is impossible to imagine a current driver owning, managing and 
driving for his own team. As Ron Dennis, the McLaren chairman, said this
 feat ‘will surely never be matched’.

‘Australia
 has lost a legend,’ reflected Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott. 
Brabham’s youngest son, David, said: ‘He lived an incredible life, 
achieving more than anyone would ever dream of.’

He leaves his 
widow, Lady Margaret and three sons, David, Geoff and Gary, all of whom 
pursued motor-racing careers. His grandsons, Matthew and Sam, are also 
racers, keeping alive an illustrious tradition into a third generation.
