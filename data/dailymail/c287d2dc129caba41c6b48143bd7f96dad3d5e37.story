After spending decades puzzling over the origin of Mima mounds, scientists have suggested that pocket gophers may be the mystery architects of the 8-foot-tall, 30-foot-wife dirt pyramids.

Mima mounds - massive, grass-covered round or oval earth pimples - were first discovered in 1841 in Western Washington state in a 630-acre prairie.

In the 19th century, explorers came up with a theory that the mounds dating back thousands of years are ancient Native American burial sites - but no human remains were ever found inside the loosely packed structures.

Struggling to explain the existence of millions of Mima mounds peppering open fields in Washington, Oregon and Idaho, experts and amateur geology enthusiasts have come up with a plethora of possible origin stories ranging from natural disasters like earthquakes and floods to aliens.

However, a recent study spearheaded by geologist Manny Gabet, of San Jose State University in California, has created a computer model showing how generations of pocket gophers measuring up to 12 inches in length and weighing only a few hundreds grams could plausibly construct a Mima mound over 500-700 years - one handful of soil and pebbles at a time. 

According to the scientist, the wee burrowing critters are intensely territorial, which could explain why every subsequent generation of gophers would return to the same Mima mound, helping to building it up over the course of centuries.

‘What's really cool about this is scaled by body size, these are the largest structures built by any mammal not including humans,’ Gabet told LiveScience's OurAmazingPlanet. ‘In terms of effort, it would be like a single person building the pyramids.’

Gabet's computer model, which appeared in the October issue of the journal Geomorphology, depicts the interplay between virtual gophers and the unique soil conditions at Mima mound locations.

What separates pocket gophers - so named because of their large cheek pouches - from other critters in the Geomyidae family is that the small furry animals push soil upward rather than downhill while working on their tunnels.

As the theory goes, pocket gophers start pushing soil up, slowly forming a mound, and their descendants are innately drawn to the high spot to continue the work.

It is important to note that no one has ever seen a Mima mound under construction, suggesting that either the building process has stopped, or it is extremely slow.

Ronald Sletten, a soil scientist at the University of Washington who has studied the state's Mima mounds, said that while Gabet's model does not provide a definitive proof that pocket gophers are indeed behind the Mima mounds, it shows that it is a possibility.
