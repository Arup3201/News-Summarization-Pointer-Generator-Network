Eminem bombarded an audience filled with veterans with the f-bomb on Tuesday night as he performed on the National Mall at The Concert for Valor.

The 42-year-old rapper, dressed in cap and hoodie, yelled into a microphone: 'Happy motherf****** Veterans Day' before launching into the show's closing set which ended with the anthemic Lose Yourself. 

Responses to his tirade during the gig, which was streamed live on HBO, were mixed.

Responses to his tirade of f-bombs during the gig, which was streamed live on HBO, were mixed on Twitter

Political strategist and CNN contributor Donna Brazile tweeted: 'Keep it classy. #Eminem #ConcertForValor '

Blogger Drew Cannady quipped: 'Well, I guess that proved @HBO doesn't believe in the 5-second delay. #fbomb #Eminem #TheConcertForValor' 

Najat Dawaji wrote: 'What is the need of swearing Eminem???? NOT COOL #valorconcert DC concert.

She then added: 'Turning off HBO after all the swearing coming out of EMINEM..they cld have put him on later..after kids like myself have gone to sleep.' 

But @MadChad412 tweeted: 'They are still talking about Eminem saying f*** on HBO like it is news. What world am I living in'

Military veterans and active-duty service members were among the hundreds of thousands of music fans who packed the National Mall on Tuesday for a free Veterans Day concert

The rapper also came under fire earlier this week for a new music video in which he threatened to punch singer Lana Del Rey, rapping: 'But I may fight for gay rights, especially if they d**e is more of a knockout than Janay Rice. Play nice? B***h I’ll punch Lana Del Rey right in the face twice, like Ray Rice in broad daylight in the plain sight of the elevator surveillance. ’Til her head is banging on the railing, then celebrate with the Ravens.'

Eminem was referring to the controversy surrounding Baltimore Ravens player Ray Rice who knocked unconscious his now-wife Janay Palmer in an Atlantic City elevator earlier this year.

Bruce Springsteen also caused controversy at the Veterans Day concert after he joined Foo Fighters' Dave Grohl and the Zac Brown Band to cover another Vietnam-era anthem, Fortunate Son.

The appropriateness of singing a counterculture era anti-war anthem that criticizes military patriotism was questioned by a number of people on Twitter.

'Maybe it's just me but Fortunate Son seems to be an inappropriate song to play at the Concert For Valor,' tweeted Jay Caruso. 

'Leave it to Hollywood to insult those who serve on Veterans Day,' tweeted Ted Newton.

Military veterans and active-duty service members were among the hundreds of thousands of music fans who packed the National Mall on Tuesday for the free Veterans Day concert.

The first-of-its-kind Concert for Valor was intended to raise awareness for issues affecting veterans.

While official crowd estimates were unavailable, organizers were expecting hundreds of thousands of people, making it one of the biggest events of the year on the Mall.

'What an amazing way to celebrate veterans on Veterans Day,' said Jack Black, one of the concert's hosts.

While tickets were free, the celebrity hosts directed fans to ways they can volunteer or donate money to causes helping war veterans. 

Some in the audience said the gesture had symbolic importance.

'This is the first time since I've been back that I've felt honored to be back home, and I'm 65 years old,' said Bobby Monk, a disabled Vietnam veteran from Washington who wore a gray Army T-shirt. 

'They treated us like criminals when we came back home. They didn't give us a parade.'

Jennifer Hudson kicked off the event appropriately with a powerful rendition of The Star-Spangled Banner, a performance reminiscent of Whitney Houston's during the 1991 Super Bowl.

She was followed by a recorded message from President Obama that told the immense crowd: 'Let's all find ways...to serve these heroes as well as they've served us.'

The massive crowd was then energized by Rihanna's anthem Diamonds and an ear-splitting set by Metallica, a longtime favorite of soldiers. 

Other performers included Carrie Underwood, the Black Keys and Jessie J.

In between the singers, extraordinary veterans were honored in video tributes hosted by Steven Spielberg, Reese Witherspoon and Oprah Winfrey, among others. 

Some of the subjects appeared onstage, including Leroy Petry, a Medal of Honor recipient who lost his right hand while serving in Iraq. 

Petry helped inspire Starbucks president Howard Schultz to write a book about veterans and pledge to hire at least 10,000 former service members.

Comedian John Oliver, whose wife is a former U.S. Army combat medic, said he's seen firsthand the difficulties that returning veterans go through.

'It's kind of staggering, the dislocation over the past decade between the civilian population and the military,' he said. 'It offends me on a personal level.'

The concert was televised live by HBO, which made its signal available to non-subscribers. 

Online streaming was also available. HBO chief executive Richard Plepler said it was possible that the concert could become an annual event.

Schultz said he hoped the concert would help more Americans recognize the importance of welcoming post-9/11 veterans back to civilian life.

'Veterans Day comes once a year. Unfortunately, at times, it's turned into an annual weekend sale,' Schultz said. 'That's not what it's about.'
