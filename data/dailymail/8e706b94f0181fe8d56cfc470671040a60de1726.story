Scientists have discovered a frog in Ecuador that can rapidly change its skin patterns to mimic the texture it sits on.

Spotted in the western Andean cloud forest, the creature is believed to be the first known amphibian to have this shape-shifting capability.

Researchers claim the ability to change skin texture to reflect its surroundings may enable the frog to camouflage itself from birds and other predators – but say this has yet to be proven.

The new species, called Pristimantis mutabilis was discovered by a Case Western Reserve University PhD student and her husband at Reserva Las Gralarias.

Katherine Krynak spotted the spiny frog, which nearly the width of a marble, sitting on a moss-covered leaf.

The Krynaks captured the frog, and nicknamed it 'punk rocker' because of the thorn-like spines covering its body.

The next day, Ms Krynak pulled the frog from the cup and set it on a smooth white sheet of plastic. It wasn't 'punk ' - it was smooth-skinned.

They assumed that, much to her dismay, she must have picked up the wrong frog.

'I then put the frog back in the cup and added some moss,' she said. 'The spines came back... we simply couldn't believe our eyes, our frog changed skin texture.

'I put the frog back on the smooth white background. Its skin became smooth.'

'The spines and colouration help them blend into mossy habitats, making it hard for us to see them,' she said. 'But whether the texture really helps them elude predators still needs to be tested.'

This is the astonishing 'glass' frog which manages to elude its predators with its see through skin - rendering it almost invisible.

The Fleischmann's Glass Frog looks as if it is changing colour as it moves, as the background shows through its transparent flesh.

The bizarre camouflage means you can still see its heart, intestines, and red blood vessels.

Photographer Thomas Marent snapped the frogs - with bulging yellow eyes - underneath leaves at a nature reserve in Choco, Colombia.

During the next three years, a team of fellow biologists studied the frogs. They found the animals shift skin texture in a little more than three minutes.

A separate research them at Universidad Tecnológica Indoamérica, Ecuador, discovered that Primates sobetes, a relative with similar markings but about twice the size of P. mutabilis, has the same trait.

Because the appearance of animals has long been one of the keys to identifying them as a certain species, the researchers believe could mean many species have been missed.

It shifts its skin texture to match what it is sitting on in  three minutes

This may to be protect itself from predators, but this is yet to be proven
