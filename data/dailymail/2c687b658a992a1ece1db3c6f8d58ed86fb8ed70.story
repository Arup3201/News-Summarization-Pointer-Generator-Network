Barbara Fari claimed to be totally disabled after tripping over, but surveillance proved she had no mobility problems, a court heard

A mother-of-13 has been accused of exaggerating an injury in an attempt to claim more than £750,000 compensation from a housing management organisation after a fall.

Lawyers for Homes for Haringey - which manages council housing in Haringey, north London - told a High Court judge that Barbara Fari, 59, lied about how badly she was hurt and should be found to be in contempt of court.

The woman then told Central London County Court that the only way she could get up and down the stairs was by dragging herself on her buttocks.

Her husband Piper Fari claimed to be working as a full-time carer for his wife and demanded that the council pay for a carer, since she was said to need 10-16 hours of care a day.

But undercover surveillance quickly revealed that Mrs Fari had no serious mobility problems.

Her medical records showed a knee complaint which pre-dated the supposed fall by years.

After suggesting the injury was worth no more than £1,500 the case was thrown out by Judge Christopher Mitchell and contempt proceedings were launched.

At a subsequent hearing, Mr Justice Holroyde observed that Mrs Fari was ‘using stairs without assistance’ and ‘carrying her shopping bags without difficulty’.

Mrs Fari has yet to put her side of the story but is expected to deny the claims. The hearing - at the High Court in London - is due to end later this week.

The lawyers said Mrs Fari claimed damages after falling five years ago - and said the claim had been dismissed by a county court judge.

They accused Mrs Fari and her husband Piper of interfering with the 'due administration of justice'.

David Melville QC, acting on behalf of Homes For Haringey, said, ‘On 16 May 2008, Mrs Fari...fell onto her right knee.

‘She served a schedule of loss in support of her claim, in which she claimed that her niece was being paid £40 per fortnight by her and her husband was providing her with care at a rate of £296 per week.

‘The claimant and her husband stated that Mrs Fari had had to give up fostering because of the accident.

‘Mrs Fari said she had to mobilise with two walking sticks.’

Mr Melville told the court that Mrs Fari had initially been offered a £7,500 settlement, but had rejected the offer as ‘derisory’.

Piper Fari arrives at the Royal Courts of Justice. He claimed he had been forced to abandon his career, in order to care for Barbara, the court heard

Piper claimed he had been forced to turn his back on his career, in order to care for Barbara, the court heard.

Upon visiting leading surgeon Mr Andrew Jackson, Mrs Fari ‘had to be helped from the chair a few steps across the room to the couch for the purposes of the examination, accompanied by pleas for glasses of water and pain-killers’, Mr Melville said.

As suspicions grew, the firm Roberston & Co were hired to secretly film Mrs Fari, on September 1 and September 20, 2011.

The first film, taken ‘no more than a 
fortnight’ after her last visit to a doctor, showed Mrs Fari with ‘no 
stick, or crutch of any sort...to be seen, nor was there...her husband 
or her son or anyone else who might have needed to help her’.

‘She lives at the top of a hill in Hornsey, and she was carrying three shopping bags - full - on one of the days.

‘Her credibility was accordingly exploded’, Mr Melville said.

The medical experts who had been duped were later shown the surveillance footage, ‘and stated in a joint statement...that they had been misled by Mrs Fari’.

‘The had been cheated’, Mr Melville said.

Mrs Mori complained of the ‘shame and the stigma’ of her condition and pretended ‘when out, I am always accompanied by my husband and we always use taxis’, the court heard.

Mrs Fari sat with her husband, her head bowed, while many of their children attended in support.

The hearing continues.
