Lewis Hamilton's relentless courting of the celebrity world has led him to engage Purple PR, a London-based agency that includes music stars Bjork, Beyoncé, Adele, Prince among its clients.

Hamilton, 30, split from Simon Fuller's XIX Entertainment towards the end of last year, as exclusively revealed by Sportsmail.

While Purple will look after his image - the style of his tweets has already grown more toe-curling ingratiating towards his followers - he is yet to appoint a new manager to negotiate a new contract at Mercedes, the team at which he won the world title last year.

A new deal is far from a formality. They covet Fernando Alonso and privately consider Hamilton high maintenance.

On Thursday, meanwhile, Hamilton made the most of his time away from the track by attending the Louis Vuitton Menswear Fall/Winter 2015-2016 show in Paris on Thursday.

The 30-year-old was dressed to impress in a navy suit and shiny shoes while sporting a new hairstyle.
