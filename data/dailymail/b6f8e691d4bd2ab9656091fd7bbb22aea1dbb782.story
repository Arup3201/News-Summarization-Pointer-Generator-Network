Events that offer to set up wealthy older men with young cash-strapped women, dubbed ‘Sugar Daddy Parties’, are about to hit Britain after becoming popular in the U.S.

The parties have been hosted at swanky New York cocktail bars, where the ‘daddies’ discuss fees for future dates with the women who take their fancy – and its organisers are now seeking London venues.

The 'matchmakers' justify the events by insisting that all participants are consenting adults and 'nobody has to do anything they don't want to' but critics say the parties are bordering on prostitution.

And the scenes from New York venues that have hosted the get-togethers, showing pretty young women hanging off the arms off much older men only add to the sleaziness factor.

On average, fees of $500 per date is 
said to be common in the U.S., but arrangements worth between $10,000 
and $20,000 per month have also been agreed upon in the past, according 
to its organiser.

Despite denying that they’re 
encouraging prostitution, organisers say the women are usually aged in 
their late teens or early twenties and are seeking money to pay for 
university fees or a more glamorous lifestyle.

And they say there are already thousands of British ‘sugar babies’ waiting to meet ‘daddies’, according to the Daily Telegraph.

The
 chief executive of the company Seeking Arrangement, Brandon Wade, told 
the newspaper: ‘We have perfected our parties and are now ready to 
launch in even bigger markets like London.

‘We are due to start in early 2012.’

At one party hosted at the Hudson 
Terrace bar in New York, 600 hopefuls turned up to meet their future 
‘sugar daddy’ or ‘sugar baby’ and while the men were charged $100 (£62) 
to attend, the women paid $40 (£25) at the door.

The average older man was aged 38, 
while the average woman was over a decade younger, however some men aged
 well into their 60s were also in attendance.

Host Alan Schneider told the newspaper his events are ‘elegant, classy and refined’, and Wade boasts two men from Forbes magazines top 10 wealthiest American billionaires among the members of his website.

While brushing off similarities to prostitution, 41-year-old Wade said: ‘People may feel obligated, but no one is required to do anything that they don’t want to.’

But in August the ‘elite sugar daddy dating site’ SeekingArrangement.com was being criticised in the U.S. for its ethos.

Ronald Weitzer, a sociology professor at George Washington University, said: 'Under the banner of sugar daddy and sugar baby arrangements, a lot of prostitution may be going on.'

Las Vegas lawyer Allen Lichtenstein said the legal parameters of prostitution are clouded.

But Mr Lichtenstein said: 'Any relationship that is an ongoing one that's not purely about sex but may have a sexual aspect to it, you can't really classify as prostitution.'

One of the site's users, 'Taylor,' said she was paid $350 to have sex with a man more than twice her age.

Taylor said: 'I just wanted to get out of that situation as safely as possible, pay off my debt, and move on.'

While a 19-year-old student from Stevenage, Demi Maguire, expressed her desire to find a sugar daddy who would pay her up to £1,800 per month for a relationship.

She said she was looking for ‘sponsorship’ in order to do volunteer work in Tanzania and Uganda for 12 weeks.

Similar websites offering to set up young women with wealthy older men such as sugardaddyforme.com and myrichsugardaddy.com have been booming with business.

And Wade seems determined to introduce Britain to the party scene.
