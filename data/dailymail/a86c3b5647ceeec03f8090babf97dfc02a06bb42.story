Rumours circulating online that former Cuban leader Fidel Castro has died have apparently been put to bed by Argentinian football hero Diego Maradona.

The sporting idol has appeared on a South American TV network  holding a typed letter which he claims is signed by 88-year-old Castro.

If it turns out to be authentic, then the note will be the first contact the elder Castro has had with the outside world since a newspaper column which appeared in Cuba's state paper on October 17.

Diego Maradona claims to have received a typed four-page letter signed by former Cuban leader Fidel Castro after rumours he had died began spreading online last week

Talk of the elder Castro's demise began just a few days after Fidel Castro Odinga, the son of a prominent Kenyan politician, died at the age of 41. Maradona seemed to put those rumours to bed today

Talk of the revolutionary's death began spreading online last week, perhaps sparked after Fidel Castro Odinga, the son of a prominent Kenyan politician, died  at the age of 41.

On Friday night South American media, including Venezuelan paper Diario de Cuba, reported that a government press conference was imminent, but no such event ever took place.

Today Maradona told television network Telesur, which is funded by allied countries including Cuba and Venezuela, that he received a four-page letter signed by Castro on Sunday night.

He said the note discussed global oil consumption, the release of Cuba's three intelligence agents by the U.S. last month, and a recent summit of the leftist ALBA bloc of Latin American countries.

'I'm very happy to know he's well,' Maradona told reporters at the Havana airport as he prepared to leave Cuba.

He added: 'Here's the signature ... I'm showing it to you so you can show it to the world.'

The elderly Communist revolutionary was last pictured in July 2014 shaking hands with foreign politicians including Chinese leader Xi Jinping

Russia leader Vladimir Putin was also pictured shaking hands with Castro, who has retreated from public life in recent years after suffering health problems

No images were shown of Castro, who has not appeared in public for more than a year.

The most recent official photographs of Castro came out of a private meeting with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Aug. 21.

He was also photographed shaking hands with the Chinese president Xi Jinping and Russian leader Vladimir Putin in July.

A serious illness forced Castro to step down from duties as president in 2006, handing over leadership to his younger brother Raul.

Analysts have been predicting the imminent demise of Castro almost continuously throughout his life, but these have increased in recent years as the politician has withdrawn from public.

Castro, who passed on Cuba's leadership to Raul in 2008, became Prime Minister of Cuba after overthrowing the government in 1959 and under his rule turned it into a one-party state.

The revolutionary passed leadership of Cuba to his elder brother Raul in 2008. His last contact with the outside world was in October last year, when he wrote a column for the state newspaper

He has lived in increasing seclusion ever since he retired from the leadership amid speculation that his health was suffering.

It is understood he was recently being cared for by his wife and by a team of nurses.

Once an enthusiastic food connoisseur, he has long since stopped visiting Havana restaurants. 

Castro and Maradona first met in 1986 when Maradona visited the island after winning the world cup with Argentina.

Maradona returned to the island in 200 where he was treated for his substance abuse problems.
