Barclays has come under fire for dishing out average bonuses of £51,400 to its investment bankers, despite axing 3,700 jobs and a spiralling compensation bill. 

The embattled lender broke the grim news to employees yesterday as it revealed its profits for last year had slumped to £246million, from £5.9billion a year earlier. 

The huge drop was driven in part by a £2.5billion bill for mis-selling payment protection insurance and complicated ‘interest rate swaps’ to small businesses.

But campaigners last night asked why Barclays was awarding huge bonuses after ‘one of the worst years in its history’.

The bank has been fighting to restore its reputation since being fined £290million last summer for rigging crucial interest rates.

Antony Jenkins, who replaced disgraced former boss Bob Diamond following the debacle, yesterday promised ‘no going back to the old ways’ as he revealed his plans to turn Barclays into the ‘go-to’ bank for customers and shareholders. 

He said ‘we get it’, referring to the public anger about the behaviour of the 320-year-old bank. 

Speaking at London’s Royal Horticultural Halls, surrounded by walls emblazoned with the bank’s five new core values – respect, integrity, service, excellence and stewardship – Mr Jenkins confirmed plans to shut down its controversial ‘tax avoidance’ arm, Structured Capital Markets. 

This was used to cut the tax bill for the bank itself and its wealthy clients. But Mr Jenkins admitted the bank would not wind down tax avoidance schemes already set up for rich customers. 

Critics poured scorn on its  efforts to show restraint on bonuses. 

The bonus pool was cut from £2.2billion to £1.85billion, and Barclays has also cut bonuses for investment bankers by 15 per cent to £1.3billion.

Despite this, staff will receive average bonuses of £51,400, even though they work in the part of the bank involved in the rigging of interest rates. 

Deborah Hargreaves, chairman of the High Pay Centre, said: ‘This will look like more of the same to members of the public.

‘The idea that any bonuses should be paid out after one of the most scandalous years in Barclays’ long history infringes on most people’s idea of fairness.’

Barclays Chief Executive Antony Jenkins says the bank needs to change to survive a difficult period

Shareholders were evidently pleased 
with the announcement that the bank is trimming back its staff and 
slashing costs - as the share price today quickly rose when the FTSE100 
opened.

At 8.30am Barclays' share price was 303.54 - and by 9.16am it was 315.85 - a rise of 4.05 per cent.

Barclays
published two different sets of results - one showing the pre-tax 
results in a statutory basis and the other on an adjusted basis.

On an adjusted basis, the bank's pre-tax profits rose by 26 per cent from £5.59bn in 2011 to £7.048bn in 2012.

In the report, Mr Jenkins said that 
Barclays 'needs to change' if it is to survive the difficult 
circumstances the banking sector is experiencing.

'There is no doubt that 2012 was a difficult year for Barclays and the entire banking sector,' he said.

'The behaviours which made headlines during the year stemmed from a period of 20 years in banking in which the sector became too aggressive, too focused on the short-term, and too disconnected from the needs of customers and clients, and wider society.

'Barclays was not immune from the impact of these trends, and we suffered reputational damage in 2012 as a consequence,

'Change is needed both in our industry and at Barclays.'

Barclays said 1,600 jobs have already been cut in the investment banking business since the start of the year.

Mr Jenkins, who was appointed in 
August after Bob Diamond quit in the wake of the bank's £290 million 
Libor rigging settlement, insisted bonuses had been reduced after last 
year's string of reputational blows.

He said the bank's compensation ratio - pay as a proportion of revenues - had fallen to 38 per cent from 42 per cent in 2011.

Mr
Jenkins announced he was waiving his bonus for 2012 earlier this month,
but the overall staff bonus pot for 2012 is likely to stoke further 
controversy given the recent series of scandals to rock the group.

His overhaul - dubbed Project Transform -
saw the bank broken down into 75 business units, which were examined 
for both their potential to generate sustainable profit and their 
ability to inflict reputational damage.

Mr Jenkins added: 'Barclays is changing. We intend to change what Barclays does and how we do it.'

Barclays is attempting to overhaul its image

Barclays said profits rose 26 per cent to £7.05 billion on an underlying basis, with mis-selling provisions stripped out and not including movements in the value of its own debt.

Bottom line profits were heavily impacted by mis-selling provisions.

It said the average PPI claim stood at £2,750, while it added the group sold around 4,000 interest rate swaps to small businesses of which around 3,000 were liable to potential mis-selling claims.Barclays said its investment banking business delivered a 37 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to £4.1 billion in 2012.

Its UK retail and business banking division saw profits tumble 71% to £292 million after PPI provisions, although it said profits rose 4% to £1.5 billion on an underlying basis.

Unite national officer Dominic Hook 
said: 'The chief executive's promise of a culture shift at the bank is 
to be welcomed but we need to see more progress to address the gap 
between the highest paid and the lowest paid staff at Barclays, which is
huge.

'It's shocking but 
true that the starting salary at Barclays is just £13,500 a year, making
some workers at the bank eligible to claim tax credits.

'With
pay negotiations due to start soon, Unite will be expecting the bank to
reward its staff fairly for their contribution to the success of the 
bank.'
