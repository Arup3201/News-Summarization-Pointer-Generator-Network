A man who forgave his girlfriend after she nearly killed him by stabbing him in the back has now been dumped from prison.

Gregory Todd, from Hessle, East Yorkshire, spent three months in hospital after Tiffany Baillie, 33, plunged a 12in kitchen knife into his back as he slept.

The 49-year-old forgave her for the attack and was planning to marry her after turning up at Hull Crown Court with an engagement ring in April last year.

The chef however has now had his heart broken after she sent him a letter from prison saying 'it never would have worked out' and that they had been apart for too long, the Sunday People has reported.

Mr Todd said: 'I was used like a fool but love is blind and I didn't see it. Tiffany has ruined my life and I will never be the same again.

'She has stabbed me in the back twice.'

Baillie was jailed for three years after she admitted GBH with intent.

Mr Todd wrote an emotional letter to the judge which was read out in court during the hearing.

It said: 'She has made a big mistake that she will regret for the rest of her life. Please show compassion and allow her to prove what a valuable member of society she is and a mother to her son. She will have a husband, if you allow us to marry. I promise we wonâ€™t let you down.'

Judge Michael Mettyear said: 'You must realise what you did could have killed him or caused him long-term serious injury. I will sentence you on the basis he has fully recovered or nearly recovered from the attack. The offence was aggravated by the use of a knife and the fact he was asleep at the time of the stabbing.'

Following the marriage proposal, which was relayed by her barrister, Mr Todd had to wait 24 hours to be told it had been accepted in a phonecall from Newhall Prison to his home in Hessle which the couple share.
