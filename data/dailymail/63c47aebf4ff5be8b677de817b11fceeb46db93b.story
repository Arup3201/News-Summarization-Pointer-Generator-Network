A towering statue of North Korea's former leader Kim Jong-il has been given a bizarre makeover - by having a giant bronze anorak to the late dictator added.

More than a year after the dictator's death in December 2011 thousands of military and government officials gathered in central Pyongyang for the unveiling.

The Kim Jong-il statue was placed on Pyongyang's Mansudae Hill alongside a similar tribute to his father and North Korea's founder, Kim Il-sung, who ruled the country from 1948 until his death in 1994.

But the designers of Kim Jong-il's bronze homage now appear to have modified their creation.

Originally clad in a suit jacket, authorities seemingly concluded that an anorak was more fitting for their 'Dear Leader'.

The statue's bizarre transformation was captured in two photographs taken by Japanese news agency Kyodo.

The first image, taken in December last year, shows, Kim Jong-il's bronze frame wrapped in a stiff, almost knee-length jacket.

The second photograph, taken on February 10 this year, shows the jacket has been replaced with an anorak.

Kim Jong-il was famed for his affection for his trademark anorak, which he wore on numerous 'guidance visits' across the secretive and impoverished country.

A tribute to Kim Jong-il, reportedly penned by the state-run Korean Central News Agency after his death, hailed the North Korean leader's 'threadbare and discoloured' parka as a 'symbol of revolution'.

'It is a witness of history,' the new agency's gushing obituary said of the anorak. 'The parka will be remembered forever by the Korean people.'
