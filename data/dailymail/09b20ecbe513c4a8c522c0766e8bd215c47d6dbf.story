An Arizona couple have been charged with child abuse for allegedly forcing their 16-year-old son to live outdoors for more than a month at the height of the summer in retaliation for being disrespectful.

Brian Romine, 44, and his wife, 45-year-old Shelly Anderson-Romine, from Chandler, are facing charges of physical abuse of child or vulnerable adult.

According to court records released last week, Mr Romine's 16-year-old son, who suffers from a speech impediment, sought refuge with his uncle, Tray Romine, in July telling him that his parents threw him out of the house mid-June after an argument over cake sprinkles.

Outdoor living: The boy told police that he was locked out of his room and forced to sleep in the backyard of his family's Chandler, Arizona, home in triple-digit heat  

Brian Romine allegedly had urged his son to run away from home and go live with other relatives. His stepmother, Mrs Anderson-Romine, told police the boy was a dishonest and disrespectful troublemaker

When questioned by police July 19, Brian Romine said that his son was misbehaving by opening peeling off foil lids from containers of cake sprinklers, which he then proceeded to smell or eat before replacing them on the shelf.

The teenager also allegedly angered his parents by taking loose change from their pockets and using headphones from a video game console, reported KPHO.

The child told detectives that following the sprinkles dispute, his father handed him a sleeping bag and a pillow, and told him to go sleep in a lawn chair on the back patio. The boy also said he had to use the backyard as a bathroom.

‘[They] treated their dog better than they treated [their son],’ the uncle, Tray Romine, told ABC15.

Brian Romine admitted to detectives in July that his son, who has a learning disability, had spent more than a month living in the backyard through summer heat, monsoon rains and dust storms for failing to show him respect.

According to police, Romine's wife of 10 months, Shelly Anderson-Romine, confirmed her husband's version of events, describing her stepson as a troublemaker who was disrespectful and dishonest.

Shelly-Anderson Romine claimed that her stepson had not complained once about the heat 

The 45-year-old woman also claimed that the teen did not complain even once about the triple-digit heat during his backyard exile, according to AZCentral.

The young victim has claimed that his father had encouraged him on several occasions to run away from home and go live with other relatives.

The teenager, who had lost his biological mother as a young boy, was taken into state custody with his father’s blessing and was later placed with a foster family.

The Romines are due back in court January 6.
