A Vermont woman accused of working with her husband to murder a schoolteacher was tightlipped during his murder trial on Wednesday.

Patricia Prue, 35, only answered two questions from Deputy County State's Attorney Kirk Williams during 33-year-old Allen Prue's murder trial, which asked about her address and March 25, 2012, when  Melissa Jenkins disappeared,The Burlington Free Press reported.

Prue invoked the Fifth Amendment 'under my lawyer's direction' following a third question about her memory of a March 25 phone call, the newspaper reported.

She then looked at Allen Prue and smiled at him during her short appearance, according to The Burlington Free Press.

The Prues are facing separate trials, with Patricia Prue's yet to start.

Forensic scientist Joseph Prue testified later that day that looking at Allen Prue's DNA and parts of a hat which was located near Jenkins' car 'indicates that the hat was most likely worn by Mr. Prue,' according to the newspaper.

Last week, prosecutors argued that the Prues called Jenkins and told her their car broke down, tricking her, ABC News reported.

Caledonia County State's Attorney Lisa Warren said Allen Prue confessed he and his wife wanted to 'get a girl' as someone 'they could play with,'  ABC reported.

She also argued '[Jenkins] got out of her vehicle, and as she did, she was strangled and beaten to death.'

Allen's defense last week said that Allen admitted to the crime in order to cover for Patricia, the news site reported.  

Allen Prue's lawyer Robert Klaims reportedly argued a different view, that 'In [Patricia Prue's] crazy, twisted mind she had become obsessively jealous of Melissa Jenkins. The evidence will show that Patricia Prue strangled Melissa Jenkins without telling him she was going to do it, without planning it with him and without Allen Prue aware in any way shape or form.'

Up next: Patricia Prue's trial is set to start next month. She has pleaded not guilty, and her attorneys plan to argue the insanity defense 

The couple then took Jenkins' body back to their home where they removed all of her clothes, poured bleach on the body and wrapped her in a tarp.

They dumped the body in the Connecticut River, which separates Vermont from New Hampshire, weighing the body down with blocks, and burning the clothes and tarp. 

Allen reported an hour late to his job delivering papers that night. 

When news broke that he was involved in the murder, his mother said that he had never been in trouble before and doubted that he committed the crime.

Both Allen and Patricia Prue may face life sentences.
