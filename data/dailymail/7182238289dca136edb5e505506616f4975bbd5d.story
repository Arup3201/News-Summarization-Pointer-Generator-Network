Bill Clinton is among the clientele of the most expensive cigar make in the world, it was revealed on Thursday.

The once 'dead broke' former president is a connoisseur of His Majesty's Reserve cigars, which cost $1,000 a piece, Gurkha Cigars owner and CEO Kaizad Hansotia told Bloomberg during an interview about the company.

'Bill Clinton loves the beauties. He loves the Gurkhas,' Hansotia said.

Rolls Royce of cigars: A box of Gurkha's His Majesty's Reserve cigars goes for $25,000

The Dominican Republic-made cigar is the 'Rolls Royce of the cigar industry,' Hansotia said, and boxes cost $25,000 a piece.

That price is set to rise to $30,000 next year. Only 20 boxes of the cognac-infused cigars are produced a year, the cigar boss said, and there's a three-year waiting list.

Hansotia also name-dropped Matthew McConaughey as a buyer of the company's high-end cigars, and generally noted that they are purchased by dignitaries, royal families and 'captains of the industry.'

Clinton is a known aficionado of cigars, and the company has claimed in the past that he was keen on it's Grand Reserve Churchill during his presidency.

That cigar sells for a substantially more modest $11.00 a piece. Others Gurkha cigars sell for as little as $2.00.

Clinton was rumored to love the Gurkha Grand Reserve Churchill so much in his days at the White House that he used one to sexually gratify Monica Lewinsky during their affair.

The lore has never been confirmed but independent counsel Kenneth Starr described it in a report on White House scandals.

While Clinton's loyalty's elsewhere have
 been called into question in the past, Gurkha says Clinton has always 
fancied the company's stogies.

Gurkha claimed in 2009 that it had direct knowledge that one of its cigars had a starring role in a sexual encounter between the former president and his mistress.

Now that Clinton makes millions of dollars a year more than he did when he lived at the White House, the company owner's comment suggests he's moved on to a higher-end cigar.
