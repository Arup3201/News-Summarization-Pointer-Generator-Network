Holster the young guns, the old fellas are not quite ready to step aside for the new wave of talent in men’s tennis.

These Championships have seen the emerging prospects come close to cracking the superiority of the established quartet of Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, Andy Murray and Roger Federer.

The barometer will ultimately be a new name on one of the Grand Slam trophies or, at the very least, a final not contested by one of those four.

Incredible: Roger Federer will play his 25th Slam final on Sunday

No major sport is more in need of new winners; no old guard is putting up more of a fight. In context, today’s meeting between Federer and Djokovic will be the 38th Slam final since one of the current ‘Big Four’ was not involved; in that time only two other men — Stanislas Wawrinka and Juan Martin del Potro — have crashed the gates of the winner’s circle.

It is a situation that will change, naturally, but not quite yet, despite the charges of Grigor Dimitrov and Milos Raonic, both 23, to the Wimbledon semi-finals.

Behind them, 19-year-old Nick Kyrgios and Kei Nishikori, 24, are part of a group taking large strides up the rankings, Kyrgios reaching the last eight and Nishikori already up to 12th in the world.

It’s a slow passing of the torch but one, you can see, is already happening.

Dimitrov, who battered Murray before running into Djokovic’s brick wall, put it best, saying: ‘We are already in that space, if you think about it. Quarters [Kyrgios], semis [Dimitrov, Raonic] — it’s just a matter of jumping over that next hurdle. We are all for attacking the top.‘As soon as it comes to clutch matches, like those ones against Andy Murray, Novak Djokovic, whoever else I have to play, this is where I want to get into that next gear and bring all my goods to the court.

‘But I think the rest is just a matter of time.’

For Federer, a 25th Slam final beckons against a man going into his 14th. The Swiss said: ‘It was always going to be hard to get rid of all four guys at the same time, let’s be honest.

‘It’s a big shock. In Australia, there was one [of the old guard] left in the final; here there are two again. At the French it was two.

He added: ‘I said before the tournament that it was probably going to be one of the [older] guys in the finals. Novak did his end; I was hoping I was going to be the other one. So I’m very happy with that.

‘Milos and Grigor have both been around for a while now.

‘It’s not like they came about just this year. They have been on tour for five, six years now,  so it’s not somebody entirely new.

‘But with Nick Kyrgios, he’s a totally different situation. We hope we have more of the Kyrgios type, the teenagers coming through. But I am happy to see that Grigor, Milos, all those guys, are knocking on the door more consistently now. We’ll see how the year plays out, if a few guys can make it to the Tour Finals at the end of the year.’

To that end, with Murray set to fall to 10th in the world, some or all of Nishikori, Raonic and Dimitrov could net a debut spot in the Tour Finals in London.

But for now, they are still waiting for the torch to be passed.
