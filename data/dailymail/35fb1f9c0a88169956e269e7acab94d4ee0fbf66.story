A plane which crashed in a field killing the pilot may have been flying in a group of replica historic aircraft, it emerged today.

Investigators are continuing their examination of the scene to establish why the small civilian aircraft crashed at the Army Aviation Centre in Middle Wallop, Hampshire, at 4.55pm yesterday.

Aviation enthusiasts said they believed the aircraft involved was a replica First World War Fokker.

The pilot, the only person aboard the aircraft, died at the scene, and the incident is now being investigated jointly by Hampshire Police and the Air Accidents Investigation Branch.

Witness Nick Bayes, from Andover, Hampshire, said he saw about 12 planes in the air when the accident happened, some of which seemed to him to be flying close together.

He told the BBC: ‘I was returning home and saw a large number of replica aircraft doing circuits over the airfield. There were maybe a dozen or so in the air.

‘It was unusual because they were so close together. If it was not a display itself, it looked like they were practising for a display.’

He said that he did not see the crash itself but he saw smoke coming from where the aircraft came down, adding: ‘The whole incident is very tragic.’

The pilot has not yet been formally identified while police officers attempt to trace the next of kin.
