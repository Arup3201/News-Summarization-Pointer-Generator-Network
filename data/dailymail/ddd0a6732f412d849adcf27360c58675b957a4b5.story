Justine Greening, International Development Secretary, wants British businesses to help build up 'responsible trade' with developing countries

Foreign aid is to be diverted through British companies to prevent it falling into the hands of corrupt and wasteful regimes.

Firms will use the money to win infrastructure contracts and boost struggling economies in Africa, Latin America and Asia.

The radical move, to be announced by International Development Secretary Justine Greening next week, is being seen as a victory for common sense in the bitter controversy over the £11billion international development budget, which has been ringfenced while other departments face cuts.

It follows years of criticism that the nation’s ballooning aid budget is being squandered by Third World governments on ineffective projects, or lining the pockets of corrupt officials.

Prime Minister David Cameron was said to be ‘hugely enthusiastic’ about the shift of emphasis from simply fighting poverty with handouts to economic development.

In future, a significant portion of the aid budget – adding up to billions over the years – will be used to secure contracts for British firms to build roads, railways and key buildings such as schools and hospitals.

Miss Greening will tell the London Stock Exchange next week: ‘I want to see British business joining the development push with [the Department for International Development]. We all have a huge opportunity to help build up responsible trade with the emerging economies of developing countries.

‘DfID will work not just across government with the Business Department and the Foreign Office. For the first time we will be teaming up with the CBI, industry and others to see how we can help UK businesses make a difference for developing countries.

‘We’re not doing anyone a favour leaving the economic coast clear and I believe British companies can have a real role in growing developing economies through trade.’

One of the problems Miss Greening will face is the UK's self-imposed ban on so-called ‘tied aid’.

This ban means development projects using foreign aid money have to go out to an open bidding process.

For the last 12 years, the Government has followed rules that stop UK firms directly benefiting from contracts funded by British aid.

'Tied aid’ has been frowned upon by the World Bank and the development community, which insist on international tenders. But this hasn’t prevented Britain’s competitors, such as France, from insisting only their firms can benefit from their cash.

The move is certain to be resisted by the aid lobby and Labour, which led the Millennium Development goals designed to end poverty and hunger in poor countries by 2015.

Miss Greening wants investment money to be available to typical British firms – not just the multinational giants – which wish to take advantage of Africa’s emergence as the fastest growing continent in the world.

Aid

The Government has faced huge 
hostility for sticking with its target of spending 0.7 per cent of 
national output on foreign aid, while departments at home are cut.

But
since replacing Andrew Mitchell in the post last September, Miss 
Greening has made it clear that if Britain is to maintain its commitment
to international aid, the money must be spent more usefully.

She
has cancelled future assistance to India, where there are more 
billionaires than in Britain, and earmarked part of the budget to 
support Ministry of Defence peacekeeping programmes.

And
now she proposes to make UK investment overseas the main priority. The 
department will continue existing spending in ‘crisis countries’ such as
Afghanistan, where the Government believes that ‘soft’ help in the 
shape of aid can help Britain’s broader foreign policy objectives.

To support the new policy, Miss Greening plans to use the expertise of the free market London Business School to help design and implement projects.

The Government is acutely aware that while China has been paying for and building infrastructure across Africa, Britain is being left behind.

Companies such as Balfour Beatty, one of the best road and rail contractors in the world, are being left at the starting blocks because there is no real government support for investment projects.

Kenya and Uganda have told Britain that it is now growth, infrastructure and prosperity that need cultivating.

And the Government has formed the opinion that countries across the Commonwealth no longer need general development assistance, and can work on their own or with experts in the field to address health and poverty issues.

Ideas to implement the new policy include creating some kind of British Development Bank to organise and scrutinise investment programmes and joint ventures.

It would work alongside existing institutions including the British-based Commonwealth Development Corporation and the African Development Bank.

Ideally, the Government would like the policy to reach Britain’s smaller companies, which do not currently have expertise in Africa.
