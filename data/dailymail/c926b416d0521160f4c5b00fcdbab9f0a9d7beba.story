Marine General John Allen has announced he is retiring from the military to care for his seriously-ill wife, meaning President Obama will drop Allen's nomination to lead U.S. and NATO forces in Europe.

Allen's request to retire comes just months after he was swept up in the David Petraeus sex scandal and accused of sending 'inappropriate' emails to a Tampa military social liaison officer, Jill Kelley.

He was later cleared of any wrongdoing and has denied his stepping down is related to his part in the massive military scandal which led to the resignation of Petraeus, the head of the CIA.

Stepping down: Marine General John Allen has announced his retirement from the military, declining a nomination for a role overseeing U.S. and NATO troops in Europe

Instead Allen, the longest-serving leader of U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan, has said he wishes to retire to take care of his wife Kathy, who suffers from a number of chronic health issues including an autoimmune disorder.

'For more than 35 years, my beloved Kathy has devotedly stood beside me and enabled me to serve my country,' Allen said in a statement released on Tuesday.

'It is profoundly sobering to consider how much of that time I have spent away from her and our two precious daughters. It is now my turn to stand beside them, to be there for them when they need me most.'

He said he believes his wife's condition has deteriorated to a point where she would not be authorized to travel to Belgium, where NATO is based.

He said that the new role would keep him away from his wife and their two daughters in West Virginia.

'For a long time, I told her, "When you can’t bear this anymore, just 
tell me and I’ll drop my [resignation] letter right away",' Allen said, the Washington Post reported.

But he said that he can no longer put the pressure of the decision on her, and is making the choice for both of them.

'Right now, I've just got to get her well,' Allen said. 'It's time to take care of my family.'

Allen recently left a 19-month command in Afghanistan and was nominated last fall to become the U.S. military's top soldier in Europe.

The nomination was shelved during a Pentagon investigation into emails Allen exchanged with Tampa socialite Jill Kelley, who was linked to the scandal that forced CIA Director David Petraeus to resign.

When Kelley, who threw lavish parties
for top military brass at her Tampa home, received threatening emails 
warning her to back away from her friend Petraeus, she alerted the FBI.

During
a trawl of her email accounts, agents learned that the messages had 
been sent by Petraeus'  biographer Paula Broadwell - and they also 
discovered the pair had engaged in an affair.

As agents looked through Kelley's emails, they also discovered thousands between she and Gen. Allen, and launched an investigation into messages sources called 'flirty' and 'inappropriate'.

But last month he was cleared on wrongdoing and the White House said it would push on with his nomination to lead U.S. and NATO troops in Europe.

Allen had admitted that the investigation took a toll on his wife and mother of their two daughters.

Gen. James Amos, commandant of the Marine Corps, said that the probe had affected Allen, as he delievered a speech at the American Enterprise Institute recently.

Retirement: Obama said he accepted the resignation of Allen, who lead forces in Afghanistan for 19 months

'The stuff that took place as a result of the Petraeus fallout of that, took a pretty heavy toll on John, just because he's a man of such great integrity and his integrity was being questioned,' he said.

President Obama accepted Allen's request to retire and called Allen one of  the nation's finest military leaders and a true patriot.

'I told General Allen that he has my 
deep, personal appreciation for his extraordinary service over the last 
19 months in Afghanistan, as well as his decades of service in the 
United States Marine Corps,' the president said in a statement.

In Afghanistan, Allen managed 33,000 U.S. troops and oversaw the shift from counterinsurgency operations to the development of local security forces.
