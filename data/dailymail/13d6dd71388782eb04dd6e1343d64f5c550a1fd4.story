Duwayne Brooks, pictured at the Old Bailey in 2011, was allegedly taped when he met officers with his legal counsel. Neither he nor his lawyer were aware they were being recorded, according to a police source who spoke to the BBC

Scotland Yard was last night 
investigating new claims that its officers secretly bugged meetings with
 Stephen Lawrence’s best friend.

Duwayne Brooks, who was with the 
teenager on the night he was murdered, was allegedly monitored as he met
 detectives with his lawyer.

Sources claimed the force was given permission to record two meetings as they hunted those behind the 1993 racist murder.

But details of the clandestine 
operation raised further questions about the treatment of the Lawrence 
family and their supporters.

It came as Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said
 he would support a public inquiry into claims undercover officers were 
used in a smear operation.

But the Met chief warned that it could be 
slow and inconclusive, with any criminal allegations sent back to police
 for investigation.

Stephen’s father Neville has demanded a
 judge-led inquiry, dismissing as ‘completely unsatisfactory’ plans to 
examine the allegations within the scope of two ongoing inquiries.

His second son Stuart said the 
expensive process could be avoided if Sir Bernard answered ‘13 
questions’ about the controversy submitted by his lawyer. Claims that 
police bugged Mr Brooks will inflame the crisis at the Met over its use 
of undercover officers and secretive tactics.

Now a councillor in Lewisham, 
South-East London, Mr Brooks’s life was thrown into turmoil in the wake 
of the killing. The two teenagers were standing at a bus stop when a 
gang of youths attacked them and stabbed Stephen to death.

It is claimed that the bugged meetings
 were held in an interview room at the offices of Deighton Guedalla, in 
Islington, North London, in 1999 or 2000.

Mr Brooks’s solicitor, Jane 
Deighton, demanded answers and said there was no reason for police to 
record the meetings which they had requested.

Just weeks after Stephen’s racist murder, the teenager’s distraught parents publicly accused extremists of trying to make political capital out of his death.

Neville and Doreen Lawrence accused Trotskyites of using the killing as an excuse for political violence.

In May 1993, they called for a march planned by the Anti-Nazi League and the Left-wing organisation Panther UK to be cancelled. The two groups are likely to have been among those  monitored by undercover officers in case they resorted to violence.

Mrs Lawrence told the Mail: ‘When the Panther UK people came to me, I was really frightened of them. We told them to back off. We do not want to know.’

Mr Lawrence added: ‘We are aware there are people who want to make this into something else . . . They have organised these demonstrations without consulting us.’

She said: ‘That is very worrying for 
Duwayne Brooks and for ourselves because it is quite sinister. Why 
covertly record a meeting that you have asked for?

‘Why unless it is part of something 
much bigger, why unless in fact covert recordings were happening of 
Duwayne Brooks and ourselves in different situations? That is what we 
want to know.’

One former Yard detective said: ‘There
 is no reason not to record a significant witness, in fact it’s good 
practice.

'But officers should be open about it, and ask the witness and 
his lawyers first. Doing it covertly is underhand and could later 
undermine trust. As it has.’

Earlier this week a police 
whistle-blower claimed senior officers wanted him to help ‘smear’ the 
Lawrence family.

Former undercover officer Peter Francis said he was 
sent in to infiltrate anti-racist groups that supported the Lawrence 
family.

Prime Minister David Cameron described the allegations as ‘horrific’ and vowed to ‘get the full truth out’.

Undercover cop Peter Francis made the explosive claim that he had been ordered to find 'dirt' on the murdered teenager's family

Speaking yesterday, Mr Francis 
revealed that he helped gather information on politicians during their 
earlier careers, including former Home Secretary Jack Straw.

Mr Francis said he was asked to 
provide intelligence on ‘subversives’, which included young students 
with links to radical politics.

He said they included Mr Straw and Labour MPs Diane Abbott and Jeremy Corbyn.

Mr Brooks was paid £100,000 
compensation seven years ago after a marathon legal battle over his 
treatment by police.

A Met spokesman said an investigation was launched 
yesterday after a letter was received from Mr Brooks’s lawyer.

Police chiefs feared there would be year-long riots if they went public about trying to smear the Stephen Lawrence family.

Peter Francis, the ex-police spy turned whistleblower, said senior Metropolitan Police officials had discussed whether to disclose the undercover operation to the 1998 Macpherson Inquiry.

But he claimed that, fearing a huge backlash against such abhorrent tactics, they opted for a cover-up.

Mr Francis, who personally spied on the Lawrence family, said the view of Special Branch commanders was that ‘if the public was to find out you were undercover there, they’d still be battling on the streets for about a year to come’.

Former Home Secretary Jack Straw said the claim was ‘very serious’.

Ex-Met Commissioner Paul Condon, who was in charge at the time, said he did not authorise or condone any withholding of information from Macpherson.

He added: ‘Such action, if it took place, would have been clearly wrong and in direct contravention of my instructions to co-operate fully with the inquiry.’
