The married CEO of Victoria's Secret had a sordid affair with a real estate broker which lasted two years, it was alleged today.

Multimillionaire Sharen Jester Turney has been accused of conducting the affair with Cliff Donenfeld - a luxury real estate broker in Naples, Florida - after they met at a party in 2008.

Donenfeld, 50, said that Turney, 56, promised she would leave her husband Charles for him so they could start a life together and even suggested they adopt a baby.

He told theÂ New York Post's Page Six: 'I was instrumental in every aspect of her life for two years. I was her sounding board, personally and professionally.

'Sharen said if I ended any other romantic entanglements, we could see each other every two weeks.'

Soon after they began their secret romance, he broke up with his girlfriend and the couple soon started meeting regularly in New York, Florida and Columbus, Ohio, where the famous lingerie line is based.

Donenfeld claims Turney - whose earned more than $25million in 2012 - promised him a multimillion dollar home in Naples' Port Royal community.

Tight-knit family: Sharen and Charles Turney, who have been married for more than 20 years have one son, Matthew

Skills: Victoria's Secret hired her in 2000 as president and CEO of Victoria's Secret Direct, the brand's catalogue and e-commerce arm, where she drove sales to the $1billion milestone

Soon after, he made an appointment for her to see a New York divorce lawyer but, 'she wanted to wait until after the holidays to let her husband Charles know', he said.

By 2010, the relationship started to break down but they stayed friends, he claims.

But a few weeks ago, when Donenfeld asked her for a reference so that he could move over to the fashion world, she refused.

'I was very hurt and disappointed...I never got any credit I deserved for what I did for her.' He is now planning a tell-all titled 'Side Guys'.

Representatives for the company - renowned for its Victoria's Secret Fashion Shows - and Turney did not respond to requests for comment.

Victoria's Secret hired Turney in 2000 as president and CEO of Victoria's Secret Direct, the brand's catalog and e-commerce arm, where she drove sales to $1billion.

In 2006, she was named CEO of the whole company.
