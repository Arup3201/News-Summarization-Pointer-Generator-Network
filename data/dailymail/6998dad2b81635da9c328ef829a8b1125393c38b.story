An unknown amateur artist's paintings are set to make his family £200,000 because abandoned work by Francis Bacon was found hidden on the back.

The celebrated artist used the canvases to paint his famous 'Screaming Pope' series of images on in the 1950s.

But Bacon was a ruthless self-critic and trashed his work if he wasn't satisfied with it.

He gave some large, discarded canvases to struggling amateur artist Lewis Todd on the strict instructions he had to rip them up before using them.

Unseen work by British artist Francis Bacon has been found on the back of an amateur artist's work. Bacon gave Lewis Todd the discarded canvases. It is believed to be worth £200,000

Valuable: Lesley Todd's work. His family discovered the Bacon artworks on the back of them after Mr Todd died

Mr Todd used the reverse of the canvases to paint his still-life scenes and portraits on at his studio in Cambridge.

After he died in 2006, the two-sided paintings were passed down to members of Mr Todd's family, who only then realised parts of Bacon's works were on the back.

Bacon's paintings on the reverse are a series of lines and colours, thought to create the background of the 'Screaming Pope' pieces.

The ripped-up canvases measure 2ft by 3ft each and without Bacon's work would be worth hardly anything.

But auctioneers selling the six double-sided paintings have put a pre-sale estimate of £100,000 on them, but wouldn't be surprised if they fetch twice that amount.

Chris Ewbank, of Ewbank Auctions in Guildford, Surrey, said: 'Bacon donated his pieces to a struggling artist, Lewis Todd.

'Bacon had a thing about his work that he wasn't happy with it falling into the wrong hands and going into the public domain and market, so if he didn't like it he would destroy it.

'He preferred to paint on the back of a canvas, so he thought these discarded piecescould be used by another artist, but only if he cut them up before using them.

'The images are from a series of Screaming Pope paintings before Bacon was very famous and without his work on the back, they would be worth almost nothing.

'If it was a completed Bacon piece they would be worth much more. One of the Screaming Pope series sold last November for £18.7million.

'Bacon was painting popes at that time and it was all to do with the Second World War, I think he thought the Pope had been ineffective so it was a bit of a rebellion.'

Mr Ewbank says he doesn't know how many of these discarded Bacon canvases are in existence but hopes that people who have a Lewis Todd painting will look on the back to see if they have a Bacon piece.

He added: 'People haven't necessarily got the money to buy proper Bacon paintings, so this is an opportunity to buy something from the hand of the artist.

Two of the oil paintings are expected to fetch £30,000 each. One shows the leg of a chair on the reverse and the other shows the arm of a pope.

Three pieces are expected to sell for £20,000.

One which shows a set of curtain rings on a black background, another the yellow and white edge of a chair and the third a series of vertical black stripes.

The final canvas, which has not been looked at by the the Authentication Committee of Francis Bacon, is expected to reach £10,000.

Francis Bacon was born in Dublin in 1909 and was known for his disturbing imagery and use of religious themes. He died in 1992.

Bacon was born in Dublin in 1909 and worked on his Screaming Pope paintings for around 20 years. He died in 1992.

Mr Todd was born in 1925 and worked as a graphic artist from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and received a British Empire Medal for his work.

He retired in the 1980s and opened a stall at Cambridge craft market with his wife. The auction is being held on March 20.
