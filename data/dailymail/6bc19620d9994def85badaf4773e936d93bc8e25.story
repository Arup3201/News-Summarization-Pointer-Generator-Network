A wealthy and very brave Kurdish businessman is building his own to-scale replica of the White House just 62 miles from ISIS controlled territory.

Worth upwards of $17 million, the approximation of 1600 Pennyslvania Avenue is the dream of Shihab N. Shihab, 58, who calls his would-be home, a bastion of 'beauty and simplicity' - although ISIS might call it 'target number one'.

Currently taking shape in Erbil, the capital of the autonomous Iraqi region of Kurdistan, Shihab's White House is decked with 21-carat gold leaf on the banisters and Greek marble columns at the entrance.

Good enough for Obama: The Kurdish businessman building his own version of the White House is spending upwards of $17 million on it

'I get to keep my bedroom for the rest of my life while Obama has to vacate it when his term ends,' said Shihab, 58, to Bloomberg News last week.

The home will be completed in four months and is taking shape in a part of Erbil that has been likened to Dubai for its booming real estate presence.

A buyer offered to purchase the replica for $17 million, but Shihab refused. Undeterred by the barbaric fighting raging just one half hours drive away in ISIS controlled terriroty.

'It's not finished yet completely, there's no furniture and the interior construction still needs to be done,' said Tony Hozeph, a local property developer to ABC News.

Not 1600 Pennyslvania Avenue: The acreage of the property is in Erbil, the capital of Kurdistan - one hour from ISIS controlled territory

So close: Erbil or Irbil is just one hour from ISIS controlled territory and has been saved from the barbaric Islamic State by US airstrikes

While security concerns remain, the intervention of the US Air Force seems to have deterred ISIS from be able to attack Kurdistan.

Shihab meanwhile is confident his 3,000-square-meter, three story White House will be the toast of Erbil once it is finished.

It has a 140-square-meter bedroom, five bathrooms and like the real White House its own private movie theater.

However, there is one thing that the Kurdish White House will have that Obama does not.

A Turkish bath.....'They don't have one in the White House,' said Shihab.
