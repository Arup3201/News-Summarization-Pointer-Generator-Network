Australia's heightened terror alert saw naval personnel returning for duties urged to  'look after your mates' and ordered not to wear their uniforms in public.

HMAS Sydney has just returned to the Garden Island naval base in Sydney Harbour after taking part in Exercise Kakadu, which is Australia's biggest naval warfare training drill, and border protection duties.

Those on board were under strict instruction to change into their civilian clothes ahead of leaving the dock with their loved ones. Colleagues from within the base were seen to be admonished by gate security earlier in the day, when they had apparently forgotten the edict.

Welcome home dad! HMAS Sydney crew members are re-acquainted with family and friends on the ship's return to Garden Island.

Able Seaman Candice Beech, into her third year serving and part of the vessel's Communications team, did confirm that, despite their 6 months away from home, all the crew was well aware of the recent counter-terrorism operations and measures in Australia.

On the back of two reported incidents against members of the navy, one which has since been ruled out, an email was circulated yesterday by a high-ranking naval officer to commanders, advising them that 'all ADF personnel are instructed not to wear uniforms externally'. 

As for that order not to be walking the streets in uniform or fatigues, she said 'it doesn't faze us'.

After the reunions, sailors were quick to change out of their uniforms, as directed by superiors, before leaving the naval base

'Everyone is just happy to be home, we still feel safe here,' Able Seaman Beech told Daily Mail Australia.

But there was also another very clear message from their superiors before docking at Garden Island.

'To be aware, not alert, just look out for your mates, keep an eye on everything, as we do always - we always keep an eye out,' she added.

The 'Sydney' is one of four guided missile frigates left in the Royal Australian Navy fleet, with 210 crew members under the guidance of Commander Karl Brinckmann.

Candice's family, including parents Cathy and Larry, was on hand - banner and all - to welcome her back to dry land.

'We're really proud of her and she's proud to be in the navy, she'll keep safe, they all do,' said Mrs Beech.

'No I don't think it (not wearing the uniform) will be a problem, she likes to wear them but if it's going to be a problem, she won't.'

Able Seaman Beech was happy to be home after serving in war games and border protection duties.

'It was really good, I mean you get used to it - first couple of weeks are hard,' she said.

'You miss family a lot but then you just get into your routine. Go to work, go to bed, work out.'

Naval bases have been moved onto their highest alert level of 'Charlie' and tighter security measures have included updating of identification cards for naval personnel and civilian contractors.

Naval bases are all at the highest alert level of 'Charlie' and tighter security measures have included updating of identification cards for naval personnel and civilian contractors.

Even those arriving at the HMAS Kuttabul base in Sydney's east were dressed in civilian clothes and not their defence gear. 

Defence chief Mark Binskin says 'I want people to be aware of of their situations and aware of their surroundings'

Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin, the ADF Commander, today insisted he would not be issuing a general alert for all ADF personnel to avoid wearing their uniforms and instead would leave that up to others.

'I want people to be aware of of their situations and aware of their surroundings,' he said.

'People are aware of it, commanders will make those decisions as to what is best for their people.' 

All sailors leaving HMAS Sydney today took to the streets wearing their civilian clothing
