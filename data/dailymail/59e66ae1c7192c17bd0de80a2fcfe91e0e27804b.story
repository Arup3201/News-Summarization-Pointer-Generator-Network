Stuart Hall, pictured when he was first charged in late 2012, has been sentenced to another two years and six months in prison for two counts of indecently assaulting a young girl

Disgraced broadcaster Stuart Hall has been sentenced to another two years and six months in prison for indecently assaulting an under-age girl.

But a judge has told him he would have received a 'considerably greater' sentence if he had been prosecuted under current laws.

The former It's A Knockout presenter was cleared last week of 15 counts of rape in relation to two women who claimed they were sexually assaulted by him between 1976 and 1981.

The 84-year-old was convicted by the jury at Preston Crown Court of indecently assaulting one of the complainants when she was under the age of 16, and had earlier pleaded guilty to another indecent assault on the same girl when she was 13.

The charge Hall admitted involved an incident at a dinner party where he crept into his victim’s bedroom and assaulted her.

The married father-of-two is currently serving a 30-month jail term after he pleaded guilty last year to indecently assaulting 13 other young girls, aged between nine and 17, over a 20-year period.

The ex-BBC Radio 5 Live football match commentator had not been due for release from that custodial sentence until September.

Hall will not now be eligible for release until December 2015 as today’s sentence will only begin after the end of his current jail term.

Passing sentence, Lord Justice Turner said of his offences: 'It was an act of vile bravado and horrible betrayal.'

Hall, wearing a dark suit, white shirt and striped tie, was excused from standing as sentence was passed.

He
 sat impassively in the dock, with his head bowed, his legs crossed and 
his hands resting on his lap as he listened to the proceedings through a
 large pair of headphones.

The victim of his latest offences sat yards away and began wiping away tears with a handkerchief passed to her, as details of the offences were again mentioned in court.

The judge said one of the aggravating factors of the offences against the victim was Hall’s initial public denials of guilt.

He added: 'Your lack of remorse evinced in your prepared statement to the police in which you expressed surprise against all the allegations against you when you knew you had molested her.'

Hall was 
sentenced to 12 months for the offence he admitted and was given an 
additional 18 months for the indecent assault of which he was convicted 
by the jury. He will serve half of the new sentence in custody before he is released on licence.

The
 judge said that, had Hall committed the dinner party offence in more 
recent years, his conduct would have been classed as assault by 
penetration.

It is understood that in Hall's circumstances that would have led to a minimum eight-year jail term.

The
 second assault, where he had oral sex with the victim before she was 16, would have been categorised today as sexual activity with a 
child. That too 'would have comfortably exceeded' the maximum the judge could impose.

Mr
 Justice Turner said the 'court's hands were tied' by the European Convention on Human Rights, adding: 'The sentence for each offence has to be limited 
to the maximum sentence at the date when the offence was committed.'

Hall committed the first indecent assault on the same occasion he abused another girl - which he also admitted in the first court case.

He took advantage of the victims when they were sick after drinking from a bottle of spirits.

Addressing Hall, Mr Justice Turner said: 'You volunteered to help clean them up. Your real intentions, however, were far darker.

'You saw their condition not as a cause for concern but as an ideal opportunity to carry out acts of gross sexual molestation on the two girls while they were at least partly incapacitated by drink.'

He went into the girl's bedroom and sexually assaulted her, the court heard.

'She woke up during this ordeal and you continued until at one point you tried to get on top of her,' he said.

'Eventually you desisted and left the room. As if this behaviour were not grotesque enough, on the same evening you molested your victim's friend in the very same way while purporting to give her a bath.

'The vileness of your conduct on that evening would be difficult to exaggerate. The element of breach of trust was of the utmost gravity.

'Your victim was well below the age of consent. You carried out your depredations under the roof of her parents and under the camouflage of synthetic concern for the welfare of children.

'You repaid your friends' hospitality by cynically defiling their daughter.'

The judge told Preston Crown Court (pictured) that his hands were tied by the sentencing rules at the time the offences were committed

The judge said Hall could have 'wiped the slate clean' last summer by admitting this offence earlier.

He told him: 'You therefore denied yourself the freedom from subsequent prosecution and punishment which a full confession would have given you. To this extent, you are therefore the author of your present situation.'

He went on: 'I take the view that the fact that you molested two girls in such quick succession sheds an even more sinister light on your offending than was evidenced by the one related offence to which you pleaded guilty last year.

'It is difficult to resist the conclusion that it must have been with a sense of arrogant and contemptible immunity that you defiled each of these young girls, one in the immediate wake of another.'

The offence of oral sex occurred within the context of the pair having 'frequent' sexual intercourse at the BBC studios at Piccadilly and Oxford Road in Manchester, the court heard.

Mr Justice Turner said the jury was sure that oral sex had taken place on one occasion at least.

Hall, from
 Wilmslow, Cheshire, did not give evidence at his trial but his defence 
team did not dispute that he had sexual intercourse with both 
complainants.

Apart
 from one occasion when Hall said an alleged rape of one of the girls 
when she was aged 12 did not take place, his counsel argued the 
intercourse - when they were were in their mid-teens and he was in his 
mid-40s - was consensual and that he was not a rapist.

Earlier, Crispin Aylett QC, mitigating, said Hall was a man in his 80s who had been brought to account for offences committed more than 30 years ago and had now faced three separate sets of proceedings.

Mr Aylett continued: 'That would have been intolerable for anyone but for a man of 84, facing the prospect of dying in prison, the burden can scarcely be imagined.'

'He's been punished, he's been disgraced and for what it's worth, he's been financially ruined and I say on his behalf, enough is enough.'
