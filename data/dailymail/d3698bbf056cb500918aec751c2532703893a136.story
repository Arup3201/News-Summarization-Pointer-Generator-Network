Some residents of a South Florida community were dumbfounded Thursday night to come home to a 12-foot python waiting to greet them.

Juan Rivero and his 12-year-old son found the colossal constrictor at the entrance to Gateway Estates Park in Florida City after an evening bike ride.

Together with a friend who lives nearby, the group managed to corral the creature into a neighbor's barbecue grill.

'I jumped off the bike and I ran. I was scared. I’ve never seen that before,' Rivero’s son told WFOR.

His father concurred.

'I didn’t dare to touch it. It was pretty big,' said Rivero.

They knew their family friend Daryl Brooks knew a thing or two about snakes, so they brought her in to help. Though, Brooks was expecting something a lot smaller.

'It was huge. I said, "Oh my God, it’s a python!" and the head was bigger than my hand,' she said.

Brooks' surprise didn't stop her from diving right into a struggle with the beast, however.

She enlisted the help of another man from the neighborhood and together they tag teamed the snake.

'I pulled the barbecue grill back and they got it out and we wrestled it, and it tried to wrap around the man’s arm and stuff, but we held it,' Brooks told WFOR.

They managed to pull the snake out of the barbecue grill, but their struggle wasn't quite over.

The pillow case they first tried to use to trap the snake simply wasn't large enough.

'The tail just went in the pillow case,' joked Rivero.

Instead, the group improvised and turned the barbecue's plastic cover into a temporary holding tank for the python.

A half hour or so later, Florida wildlife authorities arrived to haul the snake away to be turned over to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.
