Two women were reportedly killed on a highway in California as they tried to rescue their small dog that ran out of the car, police say.

Both women were pronounced dead at the scene, and the dog was also killed.

Sara Ornelas, 54, and Barbara Romero, 49, were on their way to a casino resort from Santa Barbara on December 21 when their dog darted out the vehicle and into traffic, where it was struck by a passing vehicle, according to local police lieutenant Butch Arnoldi.

Tragic end: Two women, Sara Ornelas and Barbara Romero, were hit killed by passing vehicles after their small dog ran into traffic on Highway 154 in California

One of the women went to retrieve the dog and was struck by another vehicle, Arnoldi told the Santa Maria Times.

Seeing this, the second woman ran into the same westbound traffic lane to save the other woman and was also struck by a vehicle.

She was knocked into the eastbound lane and hit at least two more times, Arnoldi said.

Martin Macarena, 48, of San Luis Obispo,
California, the driver of a westbound 1998 Ford van, allegedly struck 
one of the women and fled.

Macarena was found later at the Chumash Casino Resort in Santa Ynez, California, and was arrested on suspicion of felony hit and run while causing injuries, the California Highway Patrol said. Macarena wasÂ arrested in 2011 for allegedly assaulting another man with a knife.

The drivers of two other vehicles, Karen Gong, 45, and Ma Guadalupe, 41, stopped and were interviewed at the scene.

Gong, the driver of an eastbound Toyota Yaris, allegedly struck one of the two women.

Witnesses indicated that a number of other westbound vehicles may have struck one of the women as well, according to the CHP.
