UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon today condemned an attack at Aleppo University in Syria that killed scores of students and warned that the deliberate targeting of civilians was a war crime.

'Such heinous attacks are unacceptable and must stop immediately. All combating parties in Syria must abide by their obligations under international humanitarian law,' Ban said in a statement.

'Deliberate targeting of civilians and civilian targets constitutes a war crime.'

Two explosions at Aleppo's university on Tuesday killed at least 87 people, many of them students attending exams.

The cause of the explosions was not clear but the Syrian government and opposition activists blamed each other.

According to the United Nations, more than 60,000 people have been killed during a 22-month-old revolt against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, which began with peaceful protests but turned violent after Assad's forces tried to crush the demonstrations.

Mr Ban's statement came as suicide bombers driving vehicles packed with explosives blew themselves up near security targets in northern Syria, killing at least 22 people, state-run media and activists said.

The near simultaneous attacks in the city of Idlib brought the carnage of Syria's civil war to a second major urban center in northern government-held areas in as many days.

The Syrian army stepped up its operations against rebels in the north following the attacks, saying it killed and wounded dozens of 'terrorist mercenaries' today in Aleppo.

In a statement, it pledged to continue 'chasing the remnants of terrorists and cleansing the homeland of their dirt'.

The government routinely refers to rebels fighting to topple President Bashar Assad as terrorists.

There were conflicting reports about the number of explosions Wednesday in Idlib, where rebels control much of the countryside, while the regime remains in charge of the city itself.

The state-run SANA news agency said two suicide bombers hit a pair of roundabouts in the city, killing 22 people and wounding 30. It said security forces foiled two other would-be suicide bombers in the surrounding countryside who were allegedly planning to target security forces and civilians.

A Syrian government official, however, said three bombings struck a major highway and a roundabout in Idlib, killing 22 people.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also reported triple car bombings, but said they targeted official vehicles near the local security headquarters and a checkpoint. At least 24 people were killed, most of them regime forces, it said.

The reports could not immediately be reconciled.

There was no immediate responsibility claim for Wednesday's bombings, but Jabhat al-Nusra, an al-Qaida affiliated group, has claimed responsibility for suicide blasts and other attacks on Syrian government targets in the past.

The Obama administration has labeled the group a terrorist organisation.

Meanwhile, Syria's Ministry of Higher Education suspended university classes and exams nationwide a day after the massive blasts that rocked Aleppo University, setting cars alight and blowing the walls off dormitory rooms.

It remains unclear what caused the explosions, which hit the campus as students took exams.

SANA said classes and exams were suspended 'in mourning for the souls of the heroic martyrs who were assassinated by the treacherous terrorist hand'.

The minister of higher education, Mahmoud Mualla, was quoted as saying that Assad had ordered the university to be re-built 'with the utmost speed'.

The Foreign Ministry, in letters sent to the U.N. Secretary General and the President of the Security Council, called on member states to condemn the 'terrorist' crimes in Syria, including the killings of Aleppo University students.

The deputy head of the main opposition coalition today criticised Western and Arab states for failing to make good on promises to help the group isolate the embattled president.

Pledges of support from states had proven cosmetic and 'loose', the group's vice president George Sabra told Saudi-owned pan-Arab daily al-Hayat.

'There is no real political support coming to the coalition to help isolate the regime,' he said.

'The friends of the Syrian regime are providing it with the tools to kill and the friends of the Syrian people are giving the regime the time it needs.'

World powers have shown little appetite for armed intervention in Syria.

The opposition and the government have blamed each other for the university blasts, which marked a major escalation in the struggle for control of Aleppo - Syria's largest city and once the country's main commercial hub.

Activists said forces loyal to Assad launched two airstrikes on the area at the time of the blasts, while Syrian state media said a 'terrorist group' hit it with two rockets.

The scale of destruction appeared inconsistent with the rockets the rebels are known to possess.

Russia - Assad's long-standing ally and arms supplier - condemned the Aleppo explosions.

'It is clear that this was a ruthless, bloody provocation, revenge by terrorists for significant losses they have sustained in the confrontation with government forces,' the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

The competing narratives about what caused the blasts highlighted the difficulty of confirming reports from inside Syria.

The Syrian government bars most media from working in the country, making independent confirmation of events difficult. Both anti-regime activists and the government sift the information they give to journalists to boost their cause.

And civilians stuck in the middle avoid talking to the media, fearing reprisals from both sides for speaking their minds.

Aleppo has been the focus of a violent struggle for control since rebel forces, mostly from rural areas north of the city, pushed in and began clashing with government troops last summer.

The university is in the city's west, a sector still controlled by the government.

Both activists and the Assad regime said those killed in Tuesday's blasts were mostly students taking their mid-year exams and civilians who sought refuge in the university dorms after fleeing violence elsewhere.

On Tuesday, Syria's UN Ambassador Bashar Ja'afari told a Security Council meeting on combating terrorism that 'a cowardly terrorist act targeted the students of Aleppo University'. He said 82 students were killed and 152 were wounded.

Elsewhere in the country, the Syrian military stepped up attacks in the cities of Idlib, Hama and Homs, and seized hundreds of heat-seeking missiles from militants in the southern province of Deraa, state media reported.

The World Food Programme said Syria's
government had authorised it to step up food aid to some 2.5 million 
people going hungry, but did not say when it would be able to reach them all.
