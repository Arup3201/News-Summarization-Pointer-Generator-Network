Arsenal forward Theo Walcott hailed a 'great victory' as Arsenal hammered Aston Villa 5-0 at the Emirates.

Olivier Giroud opened the scoring for the Gunners after a delightful touch from Mesut Ozil. Giroud then turned provider for Ozil who added a second after 56 minutes before Walcott added a third seven minutes later.

Brad Guzan brought down Chuba Akpom and Santi Cazorla made it four from the spot before Hector Bellerin made it five in injury time.

It was Walcott's first start in 13 months after suffering a knee injury and to score was a special moment for the England international.

'In the first half we were cautious, they came at us and pressurised us,' he told Sky Sports 1.

'One-nil was a deserved lead at half-time but it was one-sided in the second half it was a great victory.
