England wonderkid Raheem Sterling remained open to starting against Estonia on Sunday night despite his personal fitness doubts.

Sportsmail understands the Liverpool forward first complained of leg weariness to coach Gary Neville during England's final training session in the lead up to the European Championship qualifier in Tallinn.

Sterling then relayed the information to manager Roy Hodgson, who, together with members of his backroom team, took the decision to omit the youngster from the starting line-up for the victory over Estonia.

Sterling, however, was still open to starting the encounter despite his own concerns - and views some of the stinging criticism aimed at him for complaining of tiredness as unfair.

The teenager still wanted to be considered for a starting role against the Estonians, though the decision was ultimately taken out of his hands.

Sources insists any suggestion that Sterling made himself unavailable for selection are false.

Sterling will report to Melwood for training on Tuesday ahead of Liverpool's clash against Queens Park Rangers.
