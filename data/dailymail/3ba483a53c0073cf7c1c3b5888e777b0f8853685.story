A Belfast MP has been hit in the head with a brick at a Unionist march in the city after celebrations to mark the anniversary of the Battle of the Boyne turned violent.

Democratic Unionist Party MP Nigel Dodds was believed to be knocked unconscious and was hospitalised after trouble broke out in the north of the city.

Rioting loyalists, at least one wielding a ceremonial sword, attacked police in a major outbreak of violence in the area.

Police were pelted with rocks, golf balls and bottles taken from recycling bins and fireworks were also thrown at police.

Around 23 officers were injured, police confirmed.

Baton rounds were fired and water cannon used by officers to disperse rioters.

Rioting also broke out in East Belfast.

Mr Dodds had earlier been allowed behind police lines to talk to senior officers in a bid to try and calm the situation.

A DUP spokesman said of Mr Dodds MP's injuries: 'It appears he was in and around the police lines and was talking to the police.

'He was hit by a brick or piece of masonry and he is presently at or on his way to Accident and Emergency.'

The Orange Order had also taken to Twitter to appeal for calm last night.

A Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) spokesman confirmed Mr Dodds had been injured and added that four officers in the area were hurt, three knocked unconscious, and were receiving treatment for their injuries.

The force used water cannon and has fired around 20 baton rounds. One man was arrested for disorderly behaviour and another for provocative behaviour.

Eyewitnesses blamed loyalists for the missile throwing.

Sticks, fireworks, drain pipes, and part of a wall were hurled at police. Rioters as young as 14 were said to have been involved.

In East Belfast, police confirmed they came under attack with a sword and missiles and water cannons were also deployed there.

Two arrests were made.

One of the injured police officers in North Belfast is being treated for head and leg injuries, police said.

At least two press photographers were also hurt.

A PSNI spokesman said: 'There is an element within these crowds that is intent on violence. 'Public safety is of paramount concern and individuals if they are gathering to watch events are advised to disperse.'

The violence was triggered by the banning of an Orange Order parade completing its normal route past the Catholic Ardoyne district.

The march had been allowed down the Crumlin Road in the mornign but the Orangemen were ordered by the Parades Commission to return via another route.

Violent skirmishes broke out before Orangemen attempted to force their way back to the Crumlin Road.

It followed a day of peaceful July 12 holiday loyal order parades across Northern Ireland, the pinnacle of loyalists' marching season.

DUP leader and Stormont First Minister Peter Robinson called for calm in Belfast.

He said: 'Violence and attacks on the PSNI and the wider community are wrong, can never be justified and must stop.

'While there is justifiable anger and frustration at the Parades Commission, who bear much responsibility for the situation in Belfast as do those who attacked parades as they passed certain locations, nonetheless, those who are using the cover of protest to attack the police are massively damaging the cause they support.

'Violence is undermining a just cause and runs totally against the wishes of the Orange Order for protest to be entirely peaceful.

'My thoughts are with those who have been injured this evening, including my colleague Nigel Dodds MP and other Orange Order members, police officers and civilians. I appeal for cool heads to prevail at this time.'

Ulster Unionist Stormont MLA Michael Copeland said the situation in East Belfast was extremely dangerous.

Bricks and bottles have been thrown by both sides and he claimed marchers came under a barrage of bottles as they walked home from a Twelfth demonstration.

He said: 'In my opinion this situation was entirely avoidable.

'The Parades Commission has rewarded bad behaviour last year and has pushed a community which is very, very angry and is not prepared to be pushed.'

Shortly before he was hurt, Mr Dodds said: 'I would appeal for everybody to stay calm, not to get involved in violence.

'The Grand Lodge have made it clear they do not want violence and the people who want to engage in violence should desist immediately.'

Loyalist bandsmen played sectarian tunes at police lines while bricks and bottles were thrown.

At one point a rioter broke down a section of wall and threw it at police shields. Others used sticks and pieces of drainpipe to batter police vehicles while some danced on top of the force's Land Rovers and tried to rip off protective plating.

Sinn Fein MLA Gerry Kelly blamed the violence on the Orange Order and unionist politicians.

He said: 'Speech after speech at the various (Orange) demonstrations were clearly designed to stir up sectarian tension and have alongside the Orange Order's failure to abide by Parades Commission determinations led directly to the violence in Belfast tonight.

'No amount of hand wringing or denial in the coming days from the Orange Order and unionist politicians can alter that reality.

'People had a right to expect better, instead what we got was a very deliberate strategy with the inevitable results being seen on the streets this evening.'

The Orange Order has appealed for calm and asked that all parades be peaceful.

Separately, crowds have built up in Armagh and motorists were warned to avoid the area.

Mr Dodds was taken to the Royal Victoria Hospital in West Belfast where a hospital spokeswoman said his condition was stable.

He is deputy leader of the DUP. The former lawyer has been North Belfast MP since 2001 but was suspended from the House of Commons chamber last week after the Parades Commission said it would ban the parade in Ardoyne.

Mr Dodds accused Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers of deliberate deception after she responded to the Commission's action.

Sinn Fein are the DUP's main power-sharing partners at Stormont.
