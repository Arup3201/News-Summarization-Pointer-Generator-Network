The sight of a dazzling blue kingfisher plunging into the clear waters of a rural river, emerging moments later with a fish in its beak, is one of the greatest of all British wildlife spectacles.

So what is this shyest of birds doing slumming it among discarded shopping trolleys on a concrete-sided river in South London?

It has chosen this unlikely spot because it provides everything it needs to raise young birds.

Out on a limb: For years, South London's River Wandle was an open sewer, but conservation work has encouraged wildlife like the kingfisher to return and fish stocks are healthy

There’s a place to nest (inside a 
disused metal pipe), plenty of small fish to feed to the growing chicks 
and, most important, fresh water.

These kingfishers, captured by photographer Tomos Brangwyn in the bustling heart of our capital, are a tribute to the amazing turn-around in the fortunes of Britain’s urban rivers over the past 50 years.

Within living memory, rivers such as the Wandle in South London were open sewers where it was impossible for wildlife to survive. Today, thanks to a concerted clean-up, urban rivers teem with life.

The most vulnerable of all Britain’s 
birds, kingfishers live fast and die young: few survive beyond their 
second birthday. They are especially hard hit by changes in the weather,
 especially flash floods, which wash away nests in an instant.

Snow and ice are bad news, too, and kingfishers are also in danger from predators such as the North American mink, introduced to Britain in 1929. However, by nesting alongside urban rivers and canals, the birds are safe from the mink, which are kept away by the constant footpath traffic of cyclists, dog walkers and joggers.

Moreover, cities are several degrees warmer than the countryside, with the temperature raised by heat from vehicles and the sun’s rays reflected from buildings. In winter, this keeps rivers and streams ice free — ideal for kingfishers.

According to the British Trust For Ornithology, there are fewer than 5,000 pairs breeding in Britain, so city-based animal welfare organisations have installed ‘kingfisher banks’ - artificial nest holes - where they can safely breed.

The good news is that these  particular kingfishers raised six healthy chicks, and they’ve started on a second brood. Hopefully next spring this new generation will be here raising a family of their own.
