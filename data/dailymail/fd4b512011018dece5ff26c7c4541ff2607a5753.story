Stuart Hall has questioned the police ‘pursuit of celebrities’ after being charged  with sex offences dating back four decades.

The broadcaster, 83, was accused of raping a young woman and 14 counts of indecent assault on children as young as nine when he attended a police station by appointment on Monday.

He appeared in court earlier this month to face accusations of three other attacks on young girls.

Further charges: Stuart Hall (pictured left outside court on January 7) was arrested yesterday on suspicion of rape and several indecent assaults, which his solicitor Louise Straw said 'raised serious issues' today

But the Radio 5 Live commentator 
believes the pursuit of celebrities by the police has led to a string of
allegations being made against him.

Speaking outside Hall’s home, his 
solicitor Louise Straw said: ‘The clear  pursuit of celebrities – an 
83-year-old in this instance – raises concerns about fairness and equal 
treatment.’

She added: ‘A number of historic allegations have been made. These are all denied.

‘None of the complainants thought fit to report any of these matters to the authorities over the last three to four decades.

‘This raises a number of serious 
issues. It would be inappropriate to make further comment pending 
trial.’

The arrest of the former It’s A Knockout presenter, who lives 
with his wife of 44 years, Hazel, in Wilmslow, Cheshire, came as the BBC
continues to deal with the fallout from the Jimmy Savile sex abuse 
scandal.

Police said it did not form part of 
Operation Yewtree, the investigation into alleged sex offences by late 
Top of the Pops presenter Savile and others.

Gary Glitter, 68, comedian Freddie 
Starr, 69, DJ Dave Lee Travis, 67, and former BBC producer Wilfred 
De’Ath, 73, have been arrested and bailed as part of that probe.

Other celebrity arrests include comedian Jim Davidson, 59 and PR guru Max Clifford, 69. All deny any wrongdoing

The
rape is alleged to have been in 1976 on a 22-year-old and the indecent 
assault offences are reported to have been committed between 1967 and 
1986. They concern ten girls aged between nine and 16.

A Lancashire Police statement said: 
‘Following consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service an 
83-year-old man has this evening been charged with one offence of rape 
and 14 offences of indecent assault.’

Hall had already been charged in December with indecently assaulting three girls.

These charges included an alleged 
assault of an eight-year-old, an 11-year-old and a woman who was then 
aged 16. The allegations cover the period between 1974 and 1984.

Hall, who is known for his 
distinctively highbrow approach to football commentary on Radio 5 Live, 
was released from custody and bailed to appear before court this month 
over the three charges.

But now that case will go before magistrates in 
Preston on April 16. He has already pleaded not guilty.

And, in light of the new allegations 
laid against him, he has been bailed to appear before magistrates, again
in Preston, on February 7.

In December, Hall’s employers at BBC 
Radio 5 Live announced he would not be working for them while the police
investigation was continuing.

Hall and his wife, who have two grown-up 
children, Daniel, 50, and Francesca, 52, are popular among the local  
community where they carry out charity work.

Hall won legions of fans in the 1970s 
and 1980s for his inimitable style and habit of breaking down in fits of
infectious laughter during It’s a Knockout.

He became an OBE in the 2012 New Year Honours for services to broadcasting and charity.

A police spokesman said: ‘We take all allegations of sexual abuse extremely seriously.’

Mr Hall appeared before magistrates a fortnight ago to deny the first three allegations of sexually abusing young girls he was accused of in December.

The veteran broadcaster, who has not been seen in public since, looked drawn and grey – a shadow of his normal ebullient self – as he entered court to face three counts of indecent assault.

Hall was asked if he understood that he faced three separate charges of indecent assault and if he wanted to enter a plea.

He replied: ‘Yes I do. Not guilty to all three charges.’

Hall, who gave his full name, James Stuart Hall, was then allowed to sit down in the witness box while further details of the charges were given at Preston Magistrates’ Court.

Following his arrest Hall condemned the police decision to carry out a dawn raid at his home.

At the time his solicitor, Miss Straw, expressed anger saying her client should not have had to suffer the humiliation of being arrested at his family home in the early hours of the morning.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
