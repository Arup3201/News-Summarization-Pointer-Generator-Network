Having solved one of the greatest mysteries of British history, scientists desperate to unearth the next one and confirm if Richard III did murder the princes in the tower have been left disappointed.

Previously secret documents show that the Church of England, backed by the Queen, has for 20 years refused repeated requests by experts to test skeletons believed to be the Tudor successors buried in Westminster Abbey.

And it appears they will not be changing their minds after the University of Leicester announced to the world
this week that the skeleton found under a council car park in Leicester is that 
of Richard III.

The hunchback king: The skeleton unearthed in a Leicester dig last September was confirmed this week as Richard III but the mystery of the two princes will not be solved this way

Crime: The princes Edward and Richard in the Tower in a 1878 painting (left) but clerics will not allow their remains held in an urn to be probed by the same scientists who found the treacherous king Richard (right)

Dastardly: On the seizure of the throne by their uncle Richard III, the young Edward V along with his brother the Duke of York were supposedly smothered in their sleep on the new king's orders

Those in charge of Wesminster Abbey will not allow the same forensic tests used to identify the former king to be tried on remains there.

Their argument is that it could set a precedent for testing any number of historical theories linked to the many famous people buried at the church.

Clerics are also concerned what they will do with the bones if they are found not to belong to who they thought they did.

Blocked: The bosses of Westminster Abbey will not let scientists in and have had the backing of the Queen and the Government to do so

Richard, depicted by William 
Shakespeare as a monstrous tyrant who murdered two princes in the Tower 
of London, died at the Battle of Bosworth Field, defeated by an army led
by Henry Tudor.

The king's 
nephews Edward and Richard were kept in the Tower of London, according 
to history recorded at the time, and 'stifled with pillows by the order of 
their 
perfidious uncle Richard the Usurper', according to the inscription on 
the urn their remains are kept in.

Leicester University's Turi King said this week they could take DNA from the princes and match it with Richard III to find if they were related.

But a Westminster Abbey spokeswoman told the Guardian: 'The recent discovery of 
Richard III does not change the abbey's position, which is that the 
mortal remains of two young children, widely believed since the 17th 
century to be the princes in tower, should not be disturbed.'

The Richard III Society, who were behind this week's confirmation of the monarch's identity, tried twice to get the urn opened in 1993 with the BBC and in 1995 with Channel 4.

But the Dean of Westminster the Very Rev Michael Mayne refused to allow carbon dating and DNA testing to get to the bottom of the mystery.

In 1993 he took advice from academics and experts who said the techniques would only age the bones to within 50 years, and as Richard III only reigned from 1483 to 1485 it would not be accurate enough.

'It could not therefore differentiate between Richard III or Henry VII –
or another – being the guilty party. Nor would the C/14 technique give 
any clue as to the age at death of the children,' the Dean said.

The Palace and Home Secretary at the time, Michael Howard, were all consulted and were in 'full agreement'.

The face of a king: There were cheers from media
who had gathered from around the world as the announcement was made at 
the University of Leicester this week

The fatal blows? This image of the skull shows where Richard III was injured

Theory: Dr Turi King discusses the DNA evidence and is the first to confirm the remains are those of Richard III and says this information will confirm if the bones in the Abbey are linked to him by blood

In 1995, dealing with the Channel 4 request, the Dean then admitted science had moved along further but could cause even more problems if he agreed to testing.

'A sample of bone (skin/hair/tissue) from a known individual related to 
the princes would be required, and that almost certainly means opening a
second tomb in the Abbey or elsewhere. If the result is positive, the 
remains of the two princes are placed back in Sir Christopher Wren's 
urn. But what if they are negative: what do we do with the remains?' he said.

'Keep them in the urn in the royal chapels, knowing they are bogus, or 
re-bury them elsewhere? And what would we have gained, other than to 
satisfy our curiosity in one area. It would not bring us any nearer the 
truth of the affair.

'There are others buried in the abbey whose identity is somewhat 
uncertain, including Richard II, and allowing these bones to be examined
could well set a precedent for other requests. I do not believe we are 
in the business of satisfying curiosity, or of certifying that remains 
in the abbey tombs are what they are said to be.'
