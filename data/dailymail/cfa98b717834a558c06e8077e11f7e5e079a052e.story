Former President Bill Clinton divulged on Wednesday that it took former secretary of state Hillary Clinton 'six months of very serious work' last year to recover from a fainting spell in December 2012 that resulted in a concussion and blood clot.

Her long recovery is 'something she never low-balled,' Bill said.

But Bill's timeline contradicts the State Department's claims just after the conclusion of Hillary's treatment in January 2013  that 'she seems to be fully recovered.'

Clinton has been traveling the country, giving speeches since July 2013 - six months after the State Department said she had 'fully recovered' from her accident in December 2012

Hillary
 Clinton took ill at some point the week of December 9, 2012,  just as she was supposed to testify 
before a Congressional committee about the terrorist attack that took 
four American lives in Benghazi, Libya three months before.

After falling in her home, Clinton incurred a concussion. The State 
Department did not say what day the accident occurred, but it described 
her concussion on December 13 as 'not severe.'

It
 was not until December 15 that State explained Clinton's accident was 
related to a stomach virus that caused her to become dehydrated and 
faint.

At
 that time, a State Department spokesman claimed that Clinton would be 
working from home the following week and would be 'staying in regular 
contact with Department and other 
officials.'

Clinton
 continued to stay at home for the following two weeks, and on December 
30, a State Department spokesman announced that he had found a blood 
clot 'in the course of a follow-up exam' and that she was being 'treated with anti-coagulants and is at New York-Presbyterian 
Hospital so that they can monitor the medication over the next 48 hours.'

The
 following day, Clinton's doctor's released a statement describing the 
location of the clot as in 'the vein that is situated in the space 
between the 
brain and the skull behind the right ear.'

'It did not result in a 
stroke, or neurological damage,' the statement said.

On January 2, doctors sent Clinton home from the hospital, and on January 7, Clinton returned to work.

It was on Clinton's first day back in the office that State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said that 'judging by the woman we saw this morning and the workload that she’s got she seems to be fully recovered.'

Clinton did not appear before Congress 
until the following month, leading some Republicans to speculate about 
the timing and seriousness of her hospitalization.

Former George W. Bush adviser Karl 
Rove reignited the debate about Hillary's physical and mental condition last week when he 
suggested at a conference that she was hiding something about her 
health.

'Thirty days in the 
hospital?' Rove said, according to the New York Post. 'And when she reappears, she's wearing glasses that are only for
 people who have traumatic brain injury? We need to know what's up with 
that.'

The Post insinuated that Rove claimed Hillary may be suffering from brain damage as a result of the clot.

'Karl Rove has deceived the country for years, but there 
are no words for this level of lying,'  Clinton spokesman Nick 
Merrill fired back.

'She is 100%. Period,' he said of Hillary's heath.

Rove told Fox News on Tuesday he never said Hillary had brain damage.

'She
 had a serious health episode and my point was 
that I think it was from the 7th of December in 2012 through the 7th of 
January of 2013, she underwent, first she had apparently a serious 
virus,' he said after being confronted with the fact that the former 
secretary of state was only in the hospital for three days, not 30 days.

After Rove explained his comments on Fox, Merrill accused Republicans of politicizing Hillary's health.

'First they
 accused her of faking it, now they've resorted to the other extreme -- 
and are flat out lying,' he said.

'Even this morning, Karl Rove is still all over 
the map and is continuing to get the facts wrong. But he doesn't care, 
because all he wants to do is inject the issue into the echo chamber, 
and he's succeeding. It's flagrant and thinly veiled.'

Former President Bill Clinton divulged on Wednesday that it took former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton six months to recover from a fainting spell that led to a concussion and blood clot in late 2012

Speaking at an event in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday, Bill Clinton said he was 'sort of dumbfounded' by Republicans' on going questions about Hillary's health. Clinton said they would do 'whatever it takes' to sully her political career, and 'there was nothing to' claims she was untruthful about her health issues.

'They went to all this trouble to say she had staged what was a terrible
 concussion that required six months of very serious work to get over,' he said. 'It’s something she never low-balled with the American people, 
never tried to pretend it didn’t happen.”

Clinton laughed Hillary's critics off, saying, 'You can’t be too upset about it.'

'It’s just the beginning. They’ll get better and better about it,' he said. 'It’s just part of the deal.'

As for Rove, Clinton said, 'I got to give him 
credit, you know, that embodies that old saying that consistency is the 
hobgoblin of little minds.'

Clinton said his wife was in good health.

'Look, she works out every week. She is strong. She is doing 
great,' Clinton said according to Buzzfeed. 'As far as I can tell, she’s in better shape than I am.'

Hillary left the State Department in February of 2013, less than a month after returning in the wake of her accident. She hit the 
speaking circuit just five months later in July of 2013.

The presumed 2016 candidate has spent the last year 
giving speeches on he own behalf and on behalf of the Clinton Foundation
 and working on her memoir, Hard Choices, which comes out in June.

She was also in Washington for a speech, yesterday. Unlike her husband, she did not discuss the controversy surrounding her recovery, however.
