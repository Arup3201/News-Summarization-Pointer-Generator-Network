Wilfried Bony has revealed that negotiations over his prospective move to Manchester City are ongoing while his agent expects the deal to be completed within 'a few days'.

Swansea are reportedly demanding £25m up-front plus £5m in add-ons for the prolific forward, while Bony wants to double his earnings to £120,000 a week.

Speaking ahead of his departure to an Ivory Coast training camp in Abu Dhabi ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations, the 26-year-old said: 'It's going on, the discussions are still going on. Now I am going to join my national team and just focus on that.
