Good Morning America anchor Robin Roberts revealed today that she will undergo chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant after being diagnosed with a blood and bone marrow disorder called MDS.

The 51-year-old, who battled breast cancer in 2007, said her older sister, Sally-Ann Roberts, will be her donor, as she is a perfect match.

This morning's announcement triggered an outpouring of support for Roberts, who has co-anchored the ABC show for seven years.

Emotional: Robin Roberts revealed that she will undergo a bone marrow transplant after being diagnosed with a blood and bone marrow disorder MDS

Fight: The anchor said she will undergo chemo and a bone marrow transplant this year as 'pretreatment' for the disease, which she says she has known about for several weeks

The award-winning broadcaster, who grew up in Mississippi, became a trending topic on Twitter and more than 13,500 people commented on an ABC post on Facebook.

A tearful Roberts tried to smile as she spoke about the disease live on air this morning. 'It is something that is called MDS… 
It is a rare 
blood disorder that affects the bone marrow,' she said. 'I'm going to beat this. My 
doctors say it and my faith says it.'

MDS, or myelodysplastic
syndrome, is a blood and bone marrow disease once known as preleukemia 
because of the progression that can be seen from MDS to leukemia.

Actor Rob Lowe was one of the first people to show his support for the journalist. 'My best thoughts to Robin Roberts at #GMA. She's a great lady and a fighter,' he Tweeted.

ESPN broadcaster Erin Andrew added: 
'Sending all the best to @RobinRoberts..I hate to hear she's going thru 
this, but know how hard she'll fight.'

Roberts' co-anchor George Stephanopoulos, who held her hand during this morning's emotional annoucement, Tweeted: 'All our love and prayers with @RobinRoberts. She’ll beat this with all the grace & grit she’s had her whole life.'

Perfect match: The 51-year-old said that her sister, Sally-Ann Roberts, right, is going to be her donor

Proud: Good Morning America co-host George Stephanopoulos told Roberts that he was in awe of the way she handled her diagnosis

About 18,000
people develop MDS each year and it can affect all blood cells,
leading to problems such as anemia, infections and bruising.

Myelodysplastic syndromes are a group of diseases in which the bone marrow does not make enough healthy blood cells.

Age and past treatment with chemotherapy or radiation therapy affect the risk of developing the disease.

It affects about 18,000 people each year - but only several hundred of those are as a result of cancer treatment.

Symptoms can include shortness of 
breath, weakness or feeling tired, skin that is paler than usual, easy 
bruising or bleeding and fever or frequent infections.

The primary approach to treating MDS is a bone marrow transplant.

The more closely matched the donor 
and recipient are, the more likely the immune system will not reject the
new marrow and treatment will be successful.

Roberts, who reportedly has a net worth of $14 million, said she contracted the disease through her treatment for breast cancer.

She will undergo chemo and a bone 
marrow transplant this year as 'pretreatment' for the disease, which she
says she has known about for several weeks.

She revealed that she will begin 
treatment today, which is why she shared the news live on air because 
she did not want viewers to be concerned if she turned up to work in bandages tomorrow.

'It's about focusing on the fight and not the fright,' Roberts said.

The veteran anchor said she was given
the upsetting diagnosis on the same day she found out she would be 
interviewing President Obama.

While some of her bone marrow was extracted for testing, she was told 
that she would be meeting the President the next day, which is where Obama revealed his support for gay marriage.

'The combination of landing the biggest interview of my career and having
a drill in my back reminds me that God only gives us what we can handle
and that it helps to have a good sense of humor when we run smack into 
the absurdity of life,' she said in a blog post.

Best wishes: ESPN broadcaster Erin Andrews said that she knows the veteran anchor will fight through the disease

While she says she will miss some days off work because of the treatment, she is determined to remain on the air.

'Bottom line: I’ve been living with this diagnosis for a while and will continue to anchor GMA,' she added in the post. 

'I love what I do and the people with whom I do it. Along with my faith, family and friends, all of you at ABC News give me the motivation and energy to face this challenge.'

Her GMA co-hosts said that they were inspired by how Roberts has handled the diagnosis.

'I am just in awe of the way you've handled this, such professionalism, showing such amazing respect for our whole family, but especially for everyone who watches, every single day,' her co-host Stephanopoulos said.

'We want you to know we love you, and we know you're going to beat this, and we believe in you, and you're going to hit this with all the courage and grace you show in your whole life.'
