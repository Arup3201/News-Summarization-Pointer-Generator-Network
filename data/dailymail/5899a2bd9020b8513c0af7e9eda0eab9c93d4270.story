Horror fans from around the world are familiar with the historic Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, Colorado. 

The iconic white residence inspired author Stephen King to pen his best-selling novel, The Shining, after he stayed there with his wife.

The hotel further served as inspiration for Stanley Kubrick's 1980 film adaptation, starring Jack Nicholson - though, interestingly, the movie's exterior shots were not filmed on site.

Love 'The Shining'? The Stanley Hotel is hosting a maze design competition in homage to the classic film

A stay at The Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, Colorado, inspired Stephen King to write the frightening novel

However, that doesn't stop them from playing the film on loop on channel 42 of the hotel's guest room TVs.

Now, to celebrate 20 years of new management, the hotel has announced a unique public competition, which will attract aspiring designers and movie lovers alike.

Amateur (and professional) designers have been called upon to design a 61,500 sq foot hedge maze, as seen in several of the film's pivotal scenes, to serve as an homage to the horror classic.

The maze was featured prominently in the movie, despite not actually having been filmed on site in Colorado

'There are few hotels in the world that share a history and story as unique as that of the Stanley Hotel,' said John W. Cullen, owner of the property.

'I am thrilled to share this special moment in my life and the hotel's history.

'We have built this place together over the years and I'm excited to invite everyone to be a part of its legacy through this special design contest.'

The maze will be comprised of 1,600 to 2,000 Alpine Currant hedge bushes and will be featured prominently on the hotel's picturesque front lawn. 

The winning design will be constructed on the hotel's picturesque front lawn for all to see

A ribbon-cutting for the maze will take place on the opening night of the 3rd annual Stanley Film Festival on April 30, 2015, following the selection of the winning design by a special panel of Estes Park residents, Stanley Hotel employees and film festival staff.

Winner will have their name placed on a recognition placard in the centre of the maze.  

More information, as well as requirements and guidelines, are available on the hotel website. All designs must be submitted by midnight on January 31, 2015.
