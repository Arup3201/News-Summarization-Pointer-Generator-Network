Dave King held talks with influential Rangers shareholder Sandy Easdale on Wednesday as he attempts to advance a £16million bail-out plan for the club.

The South African-based businessman is heading an alliance of potential investors offering substantial financial input in return for control via a new share issue.

Easdale’s position is significant as he currently holds voting rights for 26 per cent of existing shares. That provides an effective power of veto over the King group plan, as a new share issue would require the backing of 75 per cent of existing shareholders at an AGM.

Neither party made any comment  after they attempted to address numerous issues in their telephone discussion, but King is expected to release a statement on Thursday. The Castlemilk-born tycoon is hoping to reach an agreement-in-principle with the Ibrox board before he returns to Johannesburg, although it remains to be seen if that will be possible.

King is working in conjunction with other individuals including former director Paul Murray and shareholder George Letham, who loaned the club £1m in emergency funding earlier this year.

It’s believed another loan could form part of the new package the group has put forward, with the aim of providing a financial bridge to the AGM.

Rangers need for cash is pressing, with doubts about the ability to meet the December, or possibly even November, wage bill. That means the club would likely run out of money before any income arrives from a new share issue.

The situation is further complicated by the fact club accounts should be signed off ahead of an AGM. However, auditors Deloitte need to see a clear picture of the financial future before doing so.

Formal agreement over a loan plus equity deal could be the answer, but it’s thought the King group would only agree to offering a loan if assured they will gain the 75-per-cent backing required for their larger investment plan.

Should that proposal flounder then a loan from Mike Ashley would seem the likely alternative source of funding for the club.

Ashley recently increased his Rangers shareholding to 8.9 per cent and has requested an EGM to remove chief executive Graham Wallace and ally Philip Nash from the board.

The Newcastle United owner is thought to have been in talks over a loan prior to last month’s stop-gap £3.13m share offer, but those discussions reportedly broke down when Ashley wanted club trademark rights included in the deal.
