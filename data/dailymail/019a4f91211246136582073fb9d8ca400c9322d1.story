It is often the toughest players who are targeted on the field. In football, people have regularly tried to wind up Roy Keane and Joey Barton because they are going to react.

Dylan Hartley is one of the hardest men for England and Northampton but he must be coached how to handle himself if he is going to be trusted in key World Cup games.

His red card against Leicester on Saturday was daft. Somehow his team still managed to win, but you’re not going to beat South Africa or New Zealand if you’re playing most of the match with 14 men.

England international Dylan Hartley seems perplexed at why he has been sent off at Franklin's Gardens

April 2007: Banned for 26 weeks after gouging Wasps’ James Haskell and Jonny O’Connor.

March 2010: Claims of gouging versus Scotland dropped when alleged victim, Ross Ford, chose not to complain.

March 2012: Banned for eight weeks for biting Ireland flanker Stephen Ferris during Six Nations Test.

June 2012: Sin-binned against South Africa in first game as England captain.

December 2012: Given a two-week ban for striking Ulster’s Rory Best.

May 2013: Eleven-week ban after being sent off for swearing.

December 2014: Sent off for elbowing Leicester’s Matt Smith.

It is the same in the two pool games against Wales and Australia — you have to pick players who can 100 per cent handle themselves if they’re intimidated, kicked or punched.

It is one thing to be sent off in a league game, a Six Nations match or an Autumn International, but to see red in a key World Cup game would be unforgivable. 

Hartley is England’s No 1 hooker and you want him in your side, but not at the risk of him blowing a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity — to win the World Cup on home soil. 

He must take responsibility and so must Stuart Lancaster. 

This is part of coaching and you can coach players how to react because one moment of madness can ruin years of dreams and preparations. 

If Hartley can’t be trusted to keep his cool, he doesn’t play.

The best rugby teams are not angels. Look at any World Cup-winning side and you’ll find tough men whose immediate instinct is to react, but they learn how to handle themselves. That control makes the toughest players even tougher.

We used to have a buddy system that would be used if there was a flashpoint in a game. Every player had a buddy, someone they stood near to on the pitch.

Joey Barton loses his cool against Manchester City in May 2012 when he was given his marching orders

You became responsible not only for your actions, but also your buddy’s. If something kicked off, they would go in straight away and defuse the situation. The big personalities might not have liked it, but it was absolutely critical.

Hartley needs similar support and, with his poor disciplinary history, there will be no hiding place when he is scrutinised in the media. 

Lancaster has to make some big calls ahead of the opening Six Nations match against Wales — which is huge — but, if available, I would pick Hartley.

He will be targeted and Wales coaches Warren Gatland and Shaun Edwards will try to get under his skin. Gatland has tried to wind up Hartley before and he has experienced players in his squad who will try to light his fuse during the game.

Wales' flanker Sam Warburton (second left) is sent off in the Rugby World Cup semi-final against France

Sam Warburton, the Wales captain, is one of those guys. He was sent off in the 2011 World Cup semi-final against France and that ultimately killed off a country’s hopes. 

It probably should not have been a red card but he didn’t need to get into the situation in the first place. 

Even losing a player for 10 minutes can upset the balance of a game — as Hartley found out last month when he was sin-binned during the defeat by the Springboks.

You show your toughness in the scrums, lineouts, rucks and mauls. Brawls, cheap shots and daft fights don’t win you matches. Hartley must learn how to keep his cool.

 Luckily for his side they went on to win the match

However that would not happen on the international stage against top quality opposition like South Africa and New Zealand

Sir Clive Woodward maintains Hartley is a key player for England but he must be tamed or risk ruining England's 2015 Rugby World Cup hopes

Head coach Stuart Lancaster must also take responsibility
