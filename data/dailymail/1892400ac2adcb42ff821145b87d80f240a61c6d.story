It doesn't take a food expert to say that Western and Asian foods taste different. But it does take an expert to explain why.

The idea of 'food pairing' isn't new - chemically analysing foods to see which flavour compounds they share has led restaurants to pair unlikely foods such as white chocolate and caviar.

But new research - analysing 381 ingredients, 1021 flavour compounds and 56,498 recipes - has found that east Asian food takes an entirely different approach. It actually avoids foods that match.

Pork chops with apple wedges and raisins: Thirteen ingredients - including pork - appear in 74.4 per cent of western cooking

Beef and vegetable stir fry: While east Asian cuisine does have 'defining' flavours such as garlic and soy sauce, its approach to pairing foods is different

'Flavour pairing' has led to some of the most exciting cooking of the past few years.

But it seems that 'pairing' foods isn't a hard and fast rule - and Western and Asian foods 'pair' flavours in completely different ways.

'Western cuisines tend to use 'pairs' that share many flavours,' say the researchers in a paper published in Nature. 'But east Asian cuisines tend to avoid ingredients that share them. This investigation opens new avenues towards understanding culinary practices.'

The thickness of the 'cords' connecting the flavours here shows how many flavours they share - Western cuisine is more likely to pair foods that share lots of flavours, whereas east Asian cuisine avoids obvious 'pairs'

This crucial difference in approach explains why food from different sides of the globe tastes so radically different.

Researchers including Sebastian Ahnert from the University of Cambridge analysed 381 ingredients used around the world, and 1021 flavour compounds found in those ingredients - networking them to show how many 'flavours' each ingredient shared.

They then compared the information with 56,498 recipes from Epicurious.com and Allrecipes.com, plus a Korean recipe site menupan.com to see which of five cultures - north American, western European, southern European, Latin and East Asian - paired flavour compounds that 'matched' each other most frequently.

Two recipes analysed: Distinctly 'western' pairings - such as tomato and parmesan cheese - tend to 'pair' foods that have a lot of matching flavour compounds. Eastern matches - such as garlic and sesame oil, don't share as many flavour compounds

The results were surprising. North American and western European recipes tend to pair flavours that 'match'. Both southern European and east Asian recipes tend to avoid recipes where the ingredients share flavours.The contrast with east Asian recipes was particularly marked, the researchers found.

The more flavours two ingredients share, the less likely they are to be used together in east Asian cuisine - whereas 13 key ingredients, including butter, milk and egg, appear in 74.4 per cent of dishes in north America.

There are flavours that 'define' a cuisine - for instance basil in south European food, or soy sauce in east Asian - but the classic pairings of each cuisine, such as parmesan cheese and tomato (which share lots of flavours), and garlic and sesame oil (which share very few) show that 'food pairing' is a distinctly western idea.

The 'flavour pairs' that define western and east Asian food take a totally different approach - while Western food is built on similar pairs such as butter and milk, Asian food seeks 'clashing' pairings such as sesame oil and garlic

The idea that the difference in approach is so different is all new.

It also turns the whole idea of 'food pairing' cuisine on its head. If east Asian food tastes good by avoiding food pairs - rather than simply identifying, then pairing them - then perhaps this research paves the way for new avenues of experimental cooking.
