Chelsea were eliminated from the Champions League  as 10-man Paris St Germain twice came from behind to win an ill-tempered last-16 tie on away goals at Stamford Bridge.

The first leg was drawn 1-1 and Chelsea's advantage grew when Zlatan Ibrahimovic was harshly sent off after 31 minutes.

Gary Cahill's strike nine minutes from the end of normal time was cancelled out by former Chelsea defender David Luiz, but the hosts went ahead for a second time through an Eden Hazard penalty early in extra-time.

PSG captain Thiago Silva, who conceded the spot-kick for handball, was denied from a corner by Thibaut Courtois but then netted with a header moments later to make it 2-2 on the night and send the visitors through.

Chelsea (4-2-3-1)

Thibaut Courtois 6.5

Mainly unflappable, but beaten by Cavani’s dummy on 57 minutes; great save from Thiago Silva header in extra time.

Cesar Azpilicueta 6.5

Should be known as the running man as he never stops but not enough going forward.

Branislav Ivanovic 6

Pushed on plenty, defended in characteristic style and consistent if nothing else.

Gary Cahill 7

A superb strike to score from Terry’s flick back on 81 minutes; mostly strong when required in defence though with the odd unsure moment. 

John Terry 6.5

Kept cajoling and leading his team and defended with customary determination and provided flick back for Cahill goal but allowed Thiago Silva above him for the winner.

Oscar 6

Worked hard defensively, precise in his passing. Victim of the Ibrahimovic tackle.

Cesc Fabregas 5.5

Slow when defending counters; good in distribution. Stifled by Verratti and Motta.

Nemanja Matic 6

Solid as ever in holding midfield but struggled to get the tempo going after Ibrahimovic’s sending off.

Ramires 5.5

Couldn’t inject urgency into Chelsea attacking play as they struggled against 10 men.

Eden Hazard 7.5

Impish, skittish and at times delightful. Found it hard to find space as PSG solidified after red card but stepped up with coolness to score the penalty 

Diego Costa 6.5

A running duel with Thiago Silva and David Luiz. It was for nights such as this he was signed and he battled throughout but to no avail.

Drogba (for Ramires 90) 5.5 

Made little impact on his 37th birthday

Zouma (Matic 84) 6 

Solid enough in defensive midfield 

Manager

Jose Mourinho 6

Not much wrong with the shape or selection but Chelsea couldn’t seem to hit the required tempo – playing against ten men made no difference.

PSG (4-3-2-1)

Salvatore Sirigu 6

Occasionally unsure but in the main was solid enough and up to it when called upon.

Maxwell 7.5

Prodigious getting forward when necessary; tucked in and defended well too.

Marquinhos 7

Marking Hazard in impish form is one of the hardest jobs in football; but acquitted himself extremely well

David Luiz 8.5

Dramatic falls, play-acting, some solid defending and a superb goal.

Thiago Silva 8

Looking like a man who’d walked out of a bar-room brawl, he was imperious at the back until that moment of madness to give away the penalty. Then redeemed himself with in the most glorious manner possible.

Javier Pastore 6.5

Defended with aplomb, supporting Marquinhos whenever he could.

Marco Verratti 7.5

Sprung forward whenever he could, passed with intent and defending robustly.

Thiago Motta 7.5

Was the team’s foundation stone, marshalling the space in front of the back four; came into his own after the Ibrahimovic sending off.

Blaise Matuidi 6.5

Quikc on the counter, soild in the tackles. Did the job that was asked of him tirelessly.

Zlatan Ibrahimovic 5

He was unfortunate the ref reached for red rather than yellow – but the red-card tackle was undisciplined and un-necessary and put him at risk.

Edinson Cavani 7 

Lucky to avoid conceding a penalty on 43 minutes when he fouled Diego Costa; hit post for narrowest of angle after superb run to put himself through on 57 minutes.

Subs

Lavezzi (for Verratti 83) 6

Rabiot (for Matuidi 83) 6

Manager

Laurent Blanc 7

Even when the game plan went to pot after Ibrahimovic’s sending off, PSG remained a discipline defensive block. Their plan was well executed.
