A toddler with cerebral palsy will get the operation he needs to help him walk thanks to the generosity of Daily Mail readers.

Two-year-old Oliver Dockerty was turned down for funding by the NHS while just a few miles away an aspiring topless model was given a free breast enlargement.

The decision caused fury when reported last week. But a deluge of support from readers contributed to the £24,000 raised in just one day on a fundraising web page set up for Oliver.

Thanks: Oliver Dockerty, pictured with his mother Claire, can now undergo the selective dorsal rhizotomy surgery to help walk after Daily Mail readers donated thousands of pounds

The complex operation – selective dorsal rhizotomy – costs £25,000.

Oliver’s mother Claire Dockerty, 30, praised the Daily Mail and said: ‘Wow – what a massive response. Thank you all so much. The generosity of the public doesn’t make the NHS decision the right one but it means Oliver can now have the operation that he needs.’

Miss Dockerty, of Manchester, said Oliver has splints on his legs and, because his balance is poor, he uses a walking frame to get around.

Oliver was referred for surgery at Leeds General Infirmary. But when a surgeon applied to NHS England for funding, he was turned down as the procedure is not yet routinely covered by the NHS.

A spokesman said funding was granted only in ‘exceptional cases’, adding that proposals are being considered to offer the operation more widely later in the year.

The case contrasted sharply with that of Josie Cunningham, who had a breast enlargement on the NHS at nearby St James’s University Hospital, which is also part of the Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust.

Under NHS guidelines, cosmetic surgery should be funded only when a local trust deems it is needed to protect a patient’s health.

Miss Cunningham, who works in telesales, convinced doctors that having a flat chest was causing her severe emotional distress.

After funding was approved by her local primary care trust, she had a £4,800 operation which increased her breasts from 32A to 36DD.

Outrage: Claire Dockerty, whose son Oliver, two, needs a specialist operation in order to walk without a frame, slammed the NHS for refusing to pay for the operation
