A businessman who bought a sandwich at Atlanta airport received a nasty shock when he found his snack was crawling with maggots.

Frequent flier Joel Woloshuk picked up the snack from Café Intermezzo last week but realized something was not quite right when the parmesan cheese curls began squirming.

The restaurant now says it has switched vendors following the discovery of maggots in the focaccia bread at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport.

The businessman was making a regular trip to Miami from Atlanta when he stopped to pick up breakfast on the way.

Mr Woloshuk told WSB-TV: 'What I thought was parmesan and the parmesan began to move.'

Café Intermezzo's president said the case was isolated and the problem could not have originated at the restaurant.

He says the restaurant switched bread vendors and 'not a single crumb' from the original bakery remains.

Café Intermezzo was set up in 1979 and has three locations in Georgia including at the airport.  It specializes in European-style coffees and has a wide variety of pastries.

Atlanta Department of Aviation 
officials say they're distributing ultraviolet lights to 
Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport restaurants so they can better 
inspect food shipments.

The Clayton County Board of Health says it found no citable violation at the location that it inspected.

Maggots are fly larva and can be spread 
when garbage is not properly sealed, attacking foodstuffs and spreading 
microbial infections.
