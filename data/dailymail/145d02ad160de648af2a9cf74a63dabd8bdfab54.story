Jailed: Professor Paul Frampton has been sentenced to almost four years in a Buenos Aires jail for drug trafficking

An eminent British scientist has been jailed for almost five years after being caught smuggling cocaine in a bid to impress a glamour model more than three decades  his junior.

Professor Paul Frampton, 68, claimed he was duped into carrying the drugs by gangsters who struck up a relationship with him online by pretending to be former Miss Bikini World Denise Milani.

In fact, the Czech-born model, who is in her 30s and married, had never been in contact with the Oxford-educated physicist and had no idea that her identity was being used for the honeytrap sting.

Frampton, originally from Kidderminster, Worcestershire, was arrested in January after being stopped at Ezeiza International Airport in Buenos Aires, Argentina, as he tried to board a plane to  Peru with two kilos of cocaine in his luggage.

The drugs were found wrapped in gift paper hidden inside the lining of his suitcase. Frampton said in a newspaper interview after his arrest:

‘Perhaps I should have realised earlier but the fraudster was very good and very intelligent.

‘For 11 weeks I thought I was chatting with an attractive woman.’

The divorcee, who had been living in the US and teaching physics at the University of North Carolina for over 30 years, had first travelled to La Paz, Bolivia, where he thought he was going to meet Miss Milani for the first time.

He mistakenly believed he had been 
chatting regularly with her over the internet for several months, when 
in fact the messages were sent by someone else using her identity.

Married model Denise Milani, had no idea her identity was being used, was shocked at the sting

Meeting for the first time: Prof Frampton agreed to take a suitcase he was told belonged to Miss Milani from La Paz in Bolvia to Buenos Aires after a middle-aged man gave it to him

Claimed he was duped: Prof Frampton said it was a 'honeytrap sting' involving bikini model Denise Milani claiming he had been tricked into carrying the drugs by gangsters who posed on the internet as the model

In La Paz he met a middle-aged man in
a hotel who gave him the suitcase, saying it belonged to  Miss Milani 
and asking him to take it to her.

The following day he travelled to 
Buenos Aires and was instructed to fly to Brussels where he believed he 
would finally meet his ‘girlfriend’.

But after waiting 36 hours at the 
airport for her to send him an electronic ticket, he changed his mind 
and decided to return to the US via Peru.

The scientist has now been convicted 
of drug-trafficking at a court in Argentina after prosecutor Mario 
Villar read the court emails and text messages he sent his ‘girlfriend’ 
and a friend in the US while waiting at the airport.

According to Argentinian newspaper 
Clarin, they included ‘I’m worried about the sniffer dogs’, ‘I’m looking
after your special little suitcase’ and ‘In Bolivia this is worth 
nothing, in Europe it’s worth millions’.

Miss Bikini World: Prof Frampton said he travelled to Buenos Aires to start a new life with Miss Milani. She was completely unaware that her identity had been used in the crime

The prosecutor also showed the court a
note written by the scientist reading: ‘1grm/200U$S. 2000grms/400000 
U$S.’ A source told the newspaper: ‘At the trial he said he had written 
it after being arrested, but the arrest witnesses were asked to come 
back to court and they denied that.’

Miss Milani, who was completely 
unaware she was being used as a honeytrap, has since spoken of her shock
at being dragged into the sting.

The scientist’s ex-wife, Anne-Marie 
Frampton, 71, has described him as ‘a naive fool’. They divorced several
years ago after  15 years of marriage but remain close friends.

Frampton, who graduated with  a 
double first from Brasenose College, Oxford, was sentenced to four years
and eight months in prison, which he is expected to serve at Villa 
Devoto Prison in Buenos Aires.

The jail was the scene of some of the worst riots in Argentine history in 1978 which left 62 people dead.

The scientist was originally held 
there on remand but had been released and put under house arrest for 
health reasons. He  suffers from high blood pressure and lung problems.

He had been facing up to 16 years behind bars.

His defence lawyer Eduardo Oderigo 
said: ‘There were many good reasons to have acquitted him. I set them 
out in his defence. I am convinced of his innocence.’
