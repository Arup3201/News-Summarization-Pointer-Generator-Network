A business promising to bring ‘snuggles’ to the people of Madison, Wisconsin, has shut less than a month after opening, citing ‘harassment’ from city officials who had publicly expressed concerns that it was really just a front for prostitution.

The Snuggle House, which offered hugging, cuddling and spooning with professional snugglers for $60 an hour, attracted nationwide attention back in October when it was initially due to open.

In the end the business only opened on November 15 after weeks of delays because of inspections by city officials who were concerned that the second-floor business could be a front for prostitution.

These professional snugglers are out of work after The Snuggle House in Madison, Wisconsin, shut after being open less than a month

Assistant city attorney Jennifer Zilavy , said her first thought when she heard about the Snuggle House was ‘OK, this is going to be a place of prostitution.’

She said owner Matthew Hurtado initially 
had no business plan, no business insurance, no training protocols and 
no answers when she asked him what he would do if a snuggler was 
sexually assaulted.

Snugglers contend that touching helps relieve stress, but before it had even opened Madison police had talked openly about conducting a sting operation and city attorneys were drafting a new ordinance to regulate snuggling.

'There's no way that (sexual assault) will not happen,' said Zilavy. 'No offense to men, but I don't know any man who wants to just snuggle.'

Snuggle House owner Matthew Hurtado was accused by local officials of having no business plan, no business insurance, no training protocols and no answers when asked him what he would do if a snuggler was sexually assaulted

On Friday the business posted a message on its Facebook page that it had closed for good.

‘The Snuggle House is Officially Closed - for good. For those people who supported us, thank you. Snuggle on!’ the post read.

No specific reason was given, but on Facebook The Snuggle House posted: 'The push back and harassment is not worth it, honestly.'

The closing announcement drew scores of comments on The Snuggle House’s Facebook page, most of them sympathetic. Some said they were sad to see the business close so soon; a few said they had been hoping to try the service.

Alderman Mike Verveer, who represents the area, said he received quite a few concerned questions from locals residents and businesspeople before the business opened, but no complaints since then.

The Snuggle House had opened in downtown Madison, Wisconsin, last month, but announced on Friday that it has closed for good.

He said he was surprised to hear that The Snuggle House had closed so soon and so abruptly.

'My guess would probably be that they just didn’t have the business that they anticipated,' he told the Wisconsin State Journal.

The Facebook page for the business offers
The Snuggle House’s furniture to local church organizations 'for people
who are in need,' and promises refunds for unused gift certificates.

This type of business has been successful in the likes of New York, Colorado, and California.  

But Wisconsin's ultra-liberal capital city seemed to have deeper concerns than others where similar businesses have set up shop as cuddling has grown into a cottage industry over the past decade.

The concept was that clients would be able to book in for an hour of hugs and cuddles for $60

The Snuggle House claimed it was a legitimate business and its advertising materials included a disclaimer warning that there would be no nudity or sex

Police in Rochester, N.Y., said they've had no complaints about The Snuggery, which offers overnight cuddle sessions. Be The Love You Are in Boulder, Colo., offers cuddles with ‘Snuggle Stars.’

Cuddle Therapy in San Francisco offers packages that ‘focus directly with your current needs around connection, intimacy and touch,’ according to its website.

The nonprofit organization Cuddle Party has trained about 100 people across five continents to run group snuggle sessions, said Len Daley, a psychologist who serves as executive director at Cuddle Party headquarters in Montgomery, Ala.

Betty Martin, a Seattle-based sex educator who facilities cuddle parties in that city, said she's never had problems with government officials or police. Cuddle Party participants must keep their clothes on and go through a pre-session workshop on how to say ‘no,’ she said.

‘People think if there's touch happening there must be sex happening. That's not the case at all,’ Martin said.
