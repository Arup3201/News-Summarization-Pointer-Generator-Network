Neil Warnock says Crystal Palace loanee Wilfried Zaha only struggled at Manchester United because the club don't give enough time to youngsters.

Zaha made just two Premier League appearances for United following a £15m move from Palace, but has now returned to South London.

And Warnock has criticised United's mishandling of their young players, despite Louis van Gaal's insistence that he will give them a chance.

Neil Warnock says Wilfried Zaha was mishandled by Manchester United and is happy to have him back

Zaha has returned to Crystal Palace after making just two Premier League outings with United last season

'Wilfried has something to prove,' he told the Evening Standard. 'It will make such a difference that the fans are behind him. At Man United they don't seem to have time for the youngsters but he won't find that a problem here.

The comments from the new Eagles boss contradict those of Van Gaal, who was speaking at a press conference on Thursday addressing the sale of Mancunian Danny Welbeck to Arsenal.

He said: 'I am always willing to give players chances but they have to take them. I can't do that for them. The possibility is there and all the youngsters have to know that. Manchester United have come to me because of that.

'When you don't let go of players to other clubs then you never allow to give youth players a chance. Because of this policy, we will give youth players a chance.

Crystal Palace were busy in the last few days of the transfer window, securing the sevices of James McArthur, Zeki Fryers, as well as Zaha and Andy Johnson.

Johnson is another player set to make an emotional comeback, having impressed in red and blue 10 years ago.

But despite the relationship between the fans and the players, Warnock insists he brought the duo back for purely professional reasons. 

Andy Johnson has also returned to Crystal Palace on a free transfer from QPR

'They (Zaha and Johnson) have Palace in their hearts and the fans will relate to them. It wasn't a case of panicking. 

'It is one of the reasons why I brought Andy back to the club, not just for playing but pushing people to get into the first team. I asked him if he would do a bit of coaching with the strikers and he's enjoying it. 

'We have Fraizer Campbell, Dwight Gayle and Zaha and they're all young lads with a lot to learn. He is the ideal person to teach them a few things.'

Zaha netted on his second debut for Palace, a late equaliser against Newcastle at St James' Park.
