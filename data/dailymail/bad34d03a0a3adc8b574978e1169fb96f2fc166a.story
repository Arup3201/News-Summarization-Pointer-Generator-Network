Bangladesh fast bowler Al-Amin Hossain is the latest cricketer to have been reported for using a suspected illegal bowling action.

The match officials' report was presented to Bangladesh team manager Habibul Bashar after the team's 10-wicket loss against the West Indies on Tuesday and cited concerns about the legality of Al-Amin's action.

The 24-year-old will now undergo testing from the International Cricket Council within 21 days and Al-Amin will continue to be available in international cricket until the results are known.

Crackdown: The ICC have been stepping up their investigations into players with illegal bowling actions

The ICC has been clamping down on illegal bowling actions in recent months.

Pakistan spinner Saeed Ajmal was banned from international cricket on Tuesday after his deliveries were found to have 'exceeded the 15 degrees level of tolerance permitted under the regulations.'

Ajmal's ban came after New Zealand's Kane Williamson and Sri Lanka's Sachithra Senanayake were also suspended in July.

A statement on the ICC's website read: "Bangladesh's fast bowler Al-Amin Hossain has been reported with a suspected illegal bowling action during his side's 10 wickets loss in the first Test against the West Indies in St Vincent.

"The match officials' report, which was handed over to Bangladesh team manager Habibul Bashar after the Test concluded on Tuesday, cited concerns about the legality of the 24-year-old's bowling action.

"Al-Amin's bowling action will now be scrutinised further under the ICC process relating to suspected illegal bowling actions reported in Tests, ODIs and T20Is. He is required to undergo testing within 21 days, and, during this period, Al-Amin is permitted to continue bowling in international cricket until the results of the testing are known."
