The voices of Arsene Wenger and John Terry will be heard at Underground stations on Thursday as part of London Poppy Day.

Terry and the Arsenal manager are just two of a number of Premier League stars, including Tottenham’s Andros Townsend and QPR’s Joey Barton, to have recorded announcements at Tube stations relevant to their clubs.

Wenger’s voice, as well as that of his captain Mikel Arteta, will make travel announcements at Finsbury Park, Holloway Road and Arsenal with Terry doing the same at Earl’s Court, Fulham Broadway and West Brompton. Celebrities will also broadcast information at other stations.

It’s all part of the Royal British Legion’s annual appeal, with sport set to embrace the period of remembrance.

Every Premier League club will have poppies stitched on their shirts for this weekend’s matches as well as next — vindicating Sportsmail’s long-running campaign to have all teams displaying the British Legion emblem on their kits in the run-up to Remembrance Sunday.

The Football League confirmed that they will be following suit and are set to hold a minute’s silence before each fixture on November 7 and 8.

Roy Hodgson’s England will be together on November 11 ahead of European qualifiers against Slovenia and Scotland, with the FA confirming that the squad will stand in silence for two minutes at 11am during a filmed training session as members from the Armed Forces lay wreaths on the centre circle of the national football centre pitch.

All eight England teams using the facility at St George’s Park will wear black armbands, while both Hodgson and Under 21 manager Gareth Southgate, accompanied by a number of players, are to visit the National Memorial Arboretum in Burton-on-Trent that week.

The NFL clash between Jacksonville Jaguars and Dallas Cowboys at Wembley next Sunday will be marked by both jerseys and helmets of each player featuring a poppy.

Alistair Kirkwood, managing director of NFL UK, said: ‘The NFL has a tremendous respect and admiration for the service given by the military, both in the US and UK, and we are honoured to be able support the Poppy Appeal through fundraising and integration of the poppy into our game at Wembley.’

The 12 Premiership Rugby clubs have chosen to recognise Remembrance Sunday in a number of ways over the next few weeks.

This includes Northampton Saints selling poppies at their game on 1 November and auctioning the chance to be a team mascot at their game on 14 November with proceeds going to the Poppy Appeal. There will also be a minute’s silence before the game on 14 November and wreaths will be laid at the mini-cenotaph beside the pitch at Franklin’s Gardens which commemorates the lives of players who died in both World Wars.

There will be a minute’s silence before the kick-off of the Leicester Tigers v Barbarians match on Tues-day, 4 November and collections for the Royal British Legion.

Exeter Chiefs will be recognising the efforts of all of our Armed Forces and Emergency Services by staging a special match-day in their honour on Saturday, 8 November. Any serving member of the Armed Forces or the Emergency Services will be able to watch the game against Bath Rugby free on presentation of a current and valid ID card to club staff.
