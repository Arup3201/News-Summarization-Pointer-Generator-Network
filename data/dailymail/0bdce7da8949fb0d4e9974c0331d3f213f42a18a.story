Manchester City star Samir Nasri has launched an attack on title rivals Chelsea, claiming Jose Mourinho’s team ‘are not special at all’ and predicting a slip-up to allow his team back into the title race.

French playmaker Nasri accused Chelsea of being a one-man team in Diego Costa who rely too much on physical strength.

‘I’m a big fan of Mourinho, but I am not impressed with his team, not at all,’ said Nasri. ‘We have played Chelsea twice this season, once with 10 men, and were better than them.

‘When I have seen some of their games, I don’t think they are that fantastic — they are just strong, and have a good striker up front.

‘For me they are not special at all, and I think they are going to make some mistakes. We just have to perform, to win our games, and see what’s going to happen.’

Chelsea stayed seven points clear of City by beating Everton with a late goal from Willian on Wednesday night while Manuel Pellegrini’s side won 4-1 at Stoke. It was City’s first Premier League win since New Year’s Day, with Sergio Aguero scoring his first goals since returning from injury.

To add to the feelgood mood, £28million January signing Wilfried Bony and Yaya Toure are now available after helping Ivory Coast to win the Africa Cup of Nations.

‘No-one will win the league 10 games before the end of the season,’ Nasri said. ‘We let other people write us off — we know that the two times we won the league, we were behind at this time of the year.

‘Two months ago we were eight points behind Chelsea and came back and went level with them.

‘We will just try to get as many points as possible and wait for the mistake. We have 42 points to fight for, and if we reach 90 points we will be champions of England.’

Nasri’s optimism has been defiantly echoed by some of the senior players at the Etihad.

Pablo Zabaleta argued: ‘We are Manchester City and we never give up, simple as that.

‘We have 13 games to go to the end. We have belief in the team and if we play like we did at Stoke, we will have a great chance to catch them. We cannot afford to drop points though.’
