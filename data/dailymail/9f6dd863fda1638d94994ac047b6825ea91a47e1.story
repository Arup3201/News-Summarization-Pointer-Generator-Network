Sean Bean is battling neighbours with plans for a leafy terrace on the roof of his £4million home.

The 54-year-old actor - known for his roles in Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones and Sharpe - wants to create the terrace, surrounded by 6ft-tall glass screens and huge evergreen planters.

But neighbours in Belsize Park, north London, have complained to Camden Council - saying it will overlook them and invade their privacy. Mr Bean has now spent two years fighting for permission.

Couple: Sean Bean, who has been married four times, is reportedly dating actress Ashley Moore, 29

His original application was rejected because the terrace overlooked neighbours and his modified bid with the screens has now been turned down too.

One local said: ‘This is now the second or third time our neighbour “Mr Bean” asked to have his terrace on the second floor altered.

‘We rejected it twice. We felt it impaired our privacy, took light away etc. But anyway, he put an array of boxes with evergreen plants on that roof terrace.

‘We gave in to that but a glass wall, as low as it might be, gives us the feeling of being blocked. Why doesn’t he just erect his desired safe railings and leave the plants there and that is it?’

Ideas: Plans show a second-floor flat roof which Mr Bean wants to turn into a terrace and then screen with a mixture of olive, bay and laurel trees and a glass wall, with double doors leading into a bedroom

Desirable neighbourhood: Mr Bean, who bought his four-bedroom home in 1998, launched an appeal against the latest refusal on March 13

One opponent who lodged an official objection to the council wrote: ‘Terrace very intrusive and prominently sited and highly visible from all round.’

Plans show a second-floor flat roof which Mr Bean wants to turn into a terrace and then screen with a mixture of olive, bay and laurel trees and a glass wall, with double doors leading into a bedroom.

They were rejected by council planners in late January, who wrote: ‘The proposed privacy screen would, by virtue of its location, scale and design, detract from the appearance of the host building and fail to preserve and enhance the character and appearance of the conservation area.’

Mr Bean, who bought his four-bedroom home in 1998, launched an appeal against the latest refusal on March 13. Camden Council and the architect behind the project declined to comment.

His agent has not yet returned a request for comment. Mr Bean - whose appeal bid was reported by the Mail's Sebastian Shakespeare last week - is reportedly dating actress Ashley Moore, 29.
