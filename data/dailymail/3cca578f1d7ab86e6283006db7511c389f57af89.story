A man narrowly escaped death after he was shot in the head with a crossbow while he was lying unconscious following an outbreak of mob violence.

Rolanda Gedminas would have died if the eight-inch bolt had been just a few millimetres deeper or higher, a court head.

Rod Woolliss was jailed for 10 years yesterday after admitting the attempted murder of the 27-year-old during a mass brawl in a park in Grimsby.

Attack: An X-ray of Rolanda Gedminas' head with a crossbow bolt embedded in a salivary gland

Danger: He could have died if the bolt had been embedded just a few millimetres deeper or higher

The victim was taken to hospital with the crossbow bolt sticking out of his head, and had it removed by surgeons.

Richard Woolfall, prosecuting, told Hull Crown Court that Mr Gedminas, a leaflet distributor from Lithuania, was involved in a fight between immigrants and Grimsby locals on July 7.

Around 40 people were believed to have been present, with some people on both sides carrying weapons.

Mr Gedminas and a woman were assaulted and knocked to the ground, and he then had his head kicked and stamped on.

Weapon: The crossbow used to attack Mr Gedminas during a mass brawl in Grimsby

Jailed: Rod Woolliss admitted attempted murder and received a 10-year prison sentence

Woolliss, 22, who was one of the attackers, fired the crossbow at close range, causing a 'thud' noise.

'Woolliss took a crossbow and shot him 
to the side of the head,' Mr Woolfall said. 'He was extremely lucky to 
have survived that.'

When Mr Gedminas was taken to hospital, doctors found that the bolt had embedded itself in a salivary gland.

If it had been embedded 1mm either way, the bolt would probably have severed the victim's carotid artery or brain stem, causing almost certain death, the court heard.

And if it had been any deeper, it would have 'bisected his spinal cord', according to Mr Woolfall.

As he left the park, Woolliss was apparently boasting about his crime, telling friends he had shot a 'dirty foreigner'.

Richard Butters, mitigating, said: 'The complainant group were tooled up. They had metal bars of three to three-and-a-half-foot length.

'The foreign group provoked the situation and it could be said that they, in fact, started it.'

Accomplices: Adrian Francis, left, and Ashley Meadows, right, were also jailed for their parts in the fight

Three other thugs were also sentenced for their part in the fight.

Adrian Francis, 24, was jailed for six years and two months after admitting violent disorder and attempted grievous bodily harm.

Ashley Meadows, 26, pleaded guilty to violent disorder and was given a three-and-a-half-year sentence.

A 17-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, received an eight-month detention order for violent disorder.
