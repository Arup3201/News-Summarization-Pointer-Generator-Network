House Speaker John Boehner has been pushing a hard line on a stalemate in order to win a one-year delay on Obamacare, an aide to one of his colleagues told MailOnline exclusively

Republicans in the House of Representatives have been demanding a complete defunding of the Obamacare law in order to set up the White House for a one-year implementation delay and a 2014 electoral showdown, an aide to a senior Republican congressman has told MailOnline.

The Senate passed its first major procedural hurdle with ease on Friday, with a 79-19 vote to end debate, in which more than half of Republicans joined with Democrats. Two more votes, both strictly along party lines, amended a House budget resolution to strip language defunding Obamacare, and then to approve the resolution itself.

The GOP's political calculations are clear: Forcing Democrats to delay the Affordable Care Act's enforcement for 12 months would shift the current national anxieties about health insurance to this time next year – just weeks before the crucial 2014 congressional elections.

'Look,' said the House aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, 'you have to understand that we've been working for the delay from the beginning. There's no way the White House was going to agree to killing the funding, but if we led with a demand for a one-year "time out," we couldn't have gotten that.'

'It's like every negotiation in business, in politics, in sports salary arbitration: You make an unreasonable demand because you really want something more reasonable.'

'This is what the conference meetings have really been about.'

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid called a 12:30 p.m. vote on an amendment to the House's budget resolution, stripping the language that killed funding for the president's national health insurance overhaul. Democrats easily passed their first a procedural hurdle, collecting 79 votes for a motion to close debate on the measure.

They needed only 60.

No negotiations: White House Press Secretary Jay Carney and President Obama have both said that they're unwilling to bend on Obamacare's funding, but the GOP is banking on a middle ground

U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (L) and Senator Chuck Schumer are raising fears about a government shutdown that wouldn't affect the military, social security, or other essential services

Now that the Senate resolution has officially passed, the House will have the ball in its court with precious few days left to act until the Oct. 1 beginning of the government's next fiscal year. That's when negotiations will start.

White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer compared Republicans to mobsters and arsonists, insisting that holding the budget 'hostage' won't meet with success

House Speaker John Boehner told reporters after a Republican Conference meeting on Thursday that his chamber won't vote on the bill again if the Senate sends it back with the Obamacare funding restored. And, he said, a short-term spending resolution that takes the health care issue temporarily off the table also isn't in the cards.

'I do not see that happening,' Boehner said.

House Majority Leader Eric Cantor insisted, meanwhile, that Democrats should be willing to negotiation, and perhaps meet the GOP halfway.

'We call on the president to sit down with us – Harry Reid to sit down with us – and let’s resolve this problem,' he said.

Republicans, said the Capitol Hill aide who spoke with MailOnline, will try to convince the Obama administration that a one-year delay is in everyone's interests since it would give the White House time to work out the kinks in Obamacare's implementation.

But the GOP would also gain political leverage, denying Obama's team the change to fix those problems in time to demonstrate to a wary public before the 2014 midterm elections that all is well.

Republicans' short-term leverage is the threat of a government shutdown if a budget deal isn't reached by midnight as Monday turns to Tuesday.

But the White House has projected a defiant image, sending advisers out to insist that there will be no room for a bargain.

Dan Pfeiffer, the White House 
communications director, told CNN's Jake Tapper on Thursday that the 
administration is not in favor of 'negotiating with people with a bomb 
strapped to their chest. We're not going to do that.'

'Republicans
are not asking for a negotiation," he said. 'It's a negotiation if I'm 
trying to sell you my house, and we are debating the price of it. It's 
not a negotiation if I show up at your house and say, "Give me 
everything inside or I'm going to burn it down."'

Sen. Harkin claimed that 'we are at one of the most dangerous points in our history right now, every bit as dangerous as the break-up of the Union before the Civil War'

A tea party-led backlash against Obamacare's encroachment on freedom of choice in the health care marketplace has catapulted Obama's signature legislative achievement back into the headlines

Spokespersons for the White House and House Speaker John Boehner did not respond to requests for comment.

But Obama hinted on Sept. 24 during a Democratic Party fundraiser in New York City that the 2014 elections are a critical piece of the puzzle for a White House that misses the monopoly it held in 2009 and 2010 when Democrats controlled the House of Representatives.

Obama told party faithful that he is 'going to be working as hard as I can to make sure that we have a Congress that is able in my last two years as President to get as much done as we got done in our first two years.'

Iowa Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin complained Friday morning on the Senate floor that tea party-linked Republicans have turned Congress into an unusually acrimonious bunch, blaming 'a small group of willful men and women who have a certain ideology.'

'Since they can't get their way, they're going to create this confusion and discourse,' he said, 'and hope that the public will be so mixed up in who is to blame for this, that they'll blame both sides.'

'It's very dangerous,' Harkin insisted. 'I believe ... we are at one of the most dangerous points in our history right now. Every bit as dangerous as the break-up of the Union before the Civil War.'
