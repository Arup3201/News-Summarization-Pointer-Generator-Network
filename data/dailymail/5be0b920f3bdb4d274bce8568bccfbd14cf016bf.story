Ex-Rose Tattoo drummer Paul DeMarco's estranged wife knew his battle with depression had become desperate.

But she's testified she had no idea the ageing rocker had developed a crippling ice habit until police swooped on their northwest Sydney home.

DeMarco, who is accused of running guns alongside former bikie boss Sam Ibrahim and his younger sister Jazz Dior, launched a bid for freedom on Thursday in the NSW Supreme Court so he can check himself into a year-long drug rehabilitation program.

Former bandmate-turned-politician Angry Anderson and Paul DeMarco's wife Deirdre, were both at the New South Wales Supreme Court on Thursday in a show of support

But Acting Justice Anthony Blackmore refused the 55-year-old's bail application.

'In the circumstances, his release back into the community would involve very serious dangers,' Justice Blackmore said.

Former bandmate-turned-politician Angry Anderson and DeMarco's wife Deirdre were both in court in a show of support.

DeMarco's wife spoke of the toll his poor mental health had taken on their relationship.

The pair separated briefly after more than 20 years as a couple, she said.

DeMacro was arrested in April and charged with supplying, possessing and distributing weapons 

She gave evidence that while she had taken on three jobs and was working 12 or 14-hour days, DeMarco had been unable to find work and had taken to locking himself away in the double garage, which had been converted into a music studio at their Windsor home.

'I thought his depression was really getting to a point of desperation for me as a partner and for the family,' she said.

'I'd see him maybe during the morning for a cup of coffee or something like that.'

She had no idea DeMarco had been self-medicating with crystal methamphetamine, she said, or that he was suspected of gun supply offences, until police raided their property in April.

The former Rose Tatoo drummer requested bail on Thursday so he could attend a year-long drug rehabilitation program for his addiction to crystal methamphetamine

She said she was at work when she got the news officers were at their home, and immediately feared DeMarco had taken his own life.

'I was teaching yoga when it had all gone down,' she said.

'I thought the depression had got him, and that was it.'

She said DeMarco's enforced detox during five months behind bars had brought him back from the brink.

'He's looking very well, his mind's really clear, which is amazing,' she said.

'It's just sad that it's taken this to bring him back towards his usual self.'

Despite suggestions from DeMarco's lawyer Ibrahim was the real player in the alleged gun racket, Justice Blackmore said the crown case appeared to be strong.

'The evidence is that the firearms, or some of them, were sold to an undercover officer,' he said.

Bail was refused.
