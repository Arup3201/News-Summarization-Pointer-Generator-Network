Surprise intervention: The New Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby with his wife Caroline

The Archbishop of Canterbury yesterday signalled a softening of his opposition to gay marriage – and suggested the Church of England could even back civil partnerships for straight couples.

In a surprise intervention, the Most Reverend Justin Welby suggested his main concern about the Government’s gay marriage proposals is that ‘they don’t actually include people equally’.

Speaking to LBC Radio he said it would be ‘completely absurd’ to suggest that gay relationships were less loving than heterosexual ones.

He said the Church was ‘open to discussions’ on the issue.

He added: ‘I think that the problem with the gay marriage proposals is that they don’t actually include people equally, it’s called equal marriage, but the proposals in the Bill don’t do that.

‘I know plenty of gay couples whose relationships are an example to plenty of other people and that’s something that’s very important.

‘I’m not saying that gay relationships are in some way … you know, that the love that there is is less than the love there is between straight couples – that would be a completely absurd thing to say.

‘And civil partnership is a pretty … I understand why people want that to be strengthened and made more dignified, somehow more honourable in a good way. It’s not the same as marriage.’

Dr Welby, who highlighted the difficulty of keeping the worldwide Anglican community on board, confirmed his opposition to gay marriage as recently as last month.

His comments will be seen as a significant softening of the Church’s stance. They seem to suggest that if straight couples were allowed to have civil partnerships he would be prepared to accept gay marriage.

The Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill, a complex set of proposals that would allow gay marriages to be conducted by registrars and those religious organisations that wish to, is going through Parliament.

Civil partnerships for same-sex couples, which were introduced in 2005, carry the legal rights of marriage but lack the full symbolic commitment.

The new Archbishop, who will be enthroned next week, has already caused controversy this week after he signed a strongly-worded letter from 43 bishops that claimed the Coalition’s welfare reforms would ‘disproportionately’ affect children and were ‘unacceptable’.

But he later appeared to soften his stance, saying that the current benefits system is ‘shot full of holes, wrong incentives and incredible complexity’.

His latest remarks came as it emerged that the Church had indicated support for heterosexual couples to be allowed to form civil partnerships – despite warnings that the move would undermine marriage.

The Bishop of Norwich, the Right Reverend Graham James, told MPs considering the Bill that extending civil partnerships to straight couples would ‘fulfil a need’ for couples who wanted to make a commitment that falls short of marriage.

But a Government source said it was ‘utterly illogical’ for the Church – which is traditionally a key defender of marriage – to be promoting civil partnerships.

Liberal Democrat MP Stephen Williams has tabled an amendment calling for civil partnerships to be extended to straight couples.

This is a key demand of gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell, who argues that the new gay marriage laws will otherwise discriminate against heterosexuals. Ministers are resisting the move, arguing that it would undermine marriage.

The Bishop, who was representing the Church of England in discussions on the Bill, told MPs: ‘It seems a strange anomaly that heterosexual couples cannot register a civil partnership.

‘You have only got to look at the figures for marriage. There are now 100,000 fewer marriages in this country each year than there were 20 years ago.  The figures are quite striking, and that has given much greater acceptance of remarriage after divorce.

‘A great many heterosexual couples decide not to get married, and they do so conscientiously – it is not an accident. It may well be that heterosexual civil partnerships might fulfil a need for them.’

A Government source said ministers were astonished by the bishop’s comments, given that the Church had previously argued strongly in favour of marriage as ‘part of the glue that has bound countless successive societies together’.

The source said: ‘Our Bill is about opening up marriage to more people.

‘It’s a bedrock of our society binding families together and promoting stability – we see it as a gold standard.

‘It seems utterly illogical that the Church of England would advocate opening up civil partnerships at the expense of marriage, especially when they have previously been arguing it’s fundamental importance to our way of life.’

The support for extending civil partnerships also came under fire from the Dean of St Albans, Dr Jeffrey John, who hit the headlines a decade ago when he became the first openly gay priest to be nominated as a Church of England bishop. He declined the post  in the face of protests from traditionalists.

Mr John said civil partnerships should be abolished altogether once gay marriage has been legalised.

He told MPs: ‘My worry is that civil partnership may bring about the very thing the Church says it fears, which is that somehow the idea of faithfulness and monogamy will be diluted.’
