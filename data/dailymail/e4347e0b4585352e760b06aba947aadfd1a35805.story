They might have made it safely to the ground, but 52 skydivers are still jumping...for joy.

A big congratulations is in order since they've become world record holders after mastering an advanced flight formation above Phoenix, Arizona.

In the footage, shot through one participant's helmet-mounted camera, the daredevils are initially seen huddled together while fist-pumping in excitement as they prepare to take the plunge.

Triumph! A group of international skydivers have managed to break a world record in Phoenix 

Sun set: One participant videoed the incredible moment that the group formed a challenging 52-person formation in the upright position 

The challenge, which took place on 22 November 2014, involved around 60 skydivers occupying three separate planes.

Their nationalities range from British to American, Russian, Australian, Canadian, Mexican and German. 

As they pour out of their aircraft, one after the other and glide through the sky, 52 of them manage to grab each other's hands.

Together, they form a remarkable upright display.

Just plane crazy! Around 60 people piled in to three jets to take part in the dive 

Persistant: The 52 people who succeeded in connecting together broke a world record that 44 group members set just the day before

Keeping it up! Those 44 skydivers were keen to go even bigger, which is exactly what they did

The man donning the recorder, Zachary R Sabel from Rochelle, Illinois, explains that 'Head Up body flight is the most difficult position to balance while being able to build formations.

'In head up flying, we are balancing mass over lift, so you are battling aerodynamics the entire time.'

He adds: 'It's kind of like riding a wheelie on a bike, you always want to tip over, or never get the wheel off the ground. 

'The vibe at this event was purely amazing. It was such an honour to fly with this group of athletes.'

The skydivers broke the record twice over the course of 48 hours, initially performing the position with 44 people and then deciding to go even bigger with 52.
