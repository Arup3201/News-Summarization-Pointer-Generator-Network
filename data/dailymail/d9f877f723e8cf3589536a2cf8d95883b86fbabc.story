Three Nepalese men have been jailed for 20 years by an Indian court for the gang-rape of an American woman.

The 30-year-old US tourist had accepted a lift from the three men back to the guesthouse where she was staying in Manali, a popular tourist destination in the foothills of the Himalayas.

Instead of taking her back to her hotel, the three men drove to a secluded spot where they raped her for over an hour.

The three men were jailed by a district judge at the end of a trial in the northern state of Himachal Pradesh, local police said in a statement.

The judge ordered the three 'to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 20 years,' Vinod Kumar Dhawan, head of the police team investigating the assault, said.

In June, the woman had accepted a lift in a truck at night after struggling to find a taxi to return to her hotel.

She gave police a description of the men and also identified the truck model, which is commonly used to transport construction materials in the state.

The attack on the tourist was one of a series of assaults on foreigners visiting India this year.

In late July, an Indian court sentenced six men to life in prison for gang-raping a Swiss cyclist in the central state of Madhya Pradesh.

The sentence, awarded six months after
 the attack, comes one day after India marked the one-year anniversary 
of the fatal gang-rape of a student that drew global attention to sex 
crimes against women in India.

The
 23-year-old Indian student died of her injuries two weeks after the 
attack on a moving bus in Delhi by a pack of six men. Four of the adult 
attackers have been sentenced to death in the case.
