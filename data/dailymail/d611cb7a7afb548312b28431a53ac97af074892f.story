Roman Zozulya's first-half strike edged Dnipro to a crucial win against Dutch champions Ajax at the Kiev Olympic Stadium.

Having squandered a series of early chances the hosts took the lead on the half hour mark when Zozulya collected Yevhen Konoplyanka’s cut back to send a left-footed strike across Jasper Cillessen and into the net.

Dnipro, playing in their first ever last 16 tie in the Europa League, kept Frank De Boer’s side relatively quiet and head to Amsterdam next week in a promising position.

Ajax were hoping to maintain a seven game unbeaten run in all competitions but struggled to break down the dogged hosts.

The first chance went the way of the visitors after just four minutes as midfielder Thulani Serero attempted to chip keeper Denys Boyko but that was a rare moment of progress for Ajax.

However in first-half stoppage time Joel Veltman spurned a glorious chance to level the contest when standing all alone at the back post, but the centre-back blasted a volley way over the bar from a few yards out.

De Boer’s side improved after the break but failed to register a single shot on target and will have to improve drastically for the second leg in Amsterdam next Thursday.

It wasn't all good news for the hosts as Artem Fedetskiy, Ruslan Rotan and Roman Zozulya all picked up booking to rule themselves out of the second leg in Holland.
