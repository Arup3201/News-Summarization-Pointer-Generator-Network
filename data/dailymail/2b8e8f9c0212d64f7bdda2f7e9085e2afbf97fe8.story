Two English schoolgirls thought to have been abducted by their Thai mother while on holiday, have been found safe after a three-month search.

Annie and Alina Day, aged 11 and six, from Sevenoaks, Kent, disappeared after flying out to see their mother Onwarat Gamlem, 36, for a half-term holiday in Thailand.

They were reported missing on June 1 when their mother failed to return them to their father, Robert Day, who was granted full custody in a 2010 divorce settlement.

Annie and Alina Day, aged 11 and six, from Sevenoaks, Kent, disappeared in June after they flew out to see their mother Onwarat Gamlem. They have now been found safe and well

Miss Gamlem was arrested at a Bangkok apartment on Friday morning after a nationwide warrant was issued on charges of child abduction, according to Mr Day.

He has been reunited with the girls and told Pattaya radio station Fabulous 103FM: 'I've got them. They're with me now.'

Mr Day is said to be sorting out paperwork and attending meetings with lawyers in Thailand, and does not know when he will be returning to the UK with the children.

His sister Charlotte Dillow said: 'Both of the girls have missed so much - the last few weeks of school were especially important for Annie as she is due to start her new secondary school in September.

Police tracked down Onwarat Gamlem - formerly known as Wiganda Day and Onwarat Suphikunphong - on suspicion of abducting her daughters

'She missed the leavers service and end of term celebrations, and sports day which they both would have loved taking part in.'

Miss Gamlem vanished along with her two girls and three-year-old son from another relationship after apparently removing the SIM cards from their phones to avoid any possibility of tracing them.

The girls' Grandmother Betty Day, 70, said: 'Robert went out on Sunday May 25 with both girls. 

'They all do it once a year for two-and-a-half weeks during half-term.

'When they were married, she went and left and got a divorce and Robert got full custody.

'The girls were born in Thailand but they go to school here. Their whole life is in England and their mum didn't even want anything to do with them.'

Numerous search attempts were made to find the sisters and in recent weeks, trucks holding billboards displaying their photos have been paraded through Pattaya daily with a loud speaker.

They also played two songs - Ananya's favourite song, Beautiful Girl, and the well-known Santa Claus is Coming to Town, which Mr Day hoped would draw public attention.

Police and Interpol tracked down Gamlem - formerly known as Wiganda Day and Onwarat Suphikunphong - on suspicion of abducting her daughters.

The girls' school confirmed they had not been in lessons since before the start of the May half term.

They are pupils at Sundridge and Brasted Church of England Primary School, in Sundridge, Kent.
