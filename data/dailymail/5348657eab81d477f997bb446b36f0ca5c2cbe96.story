Youngsters who suffer from a rare and incurable disorder that causes chronic skin inflammation have been given hope for the future in the form of a genetically modified graft.

Children with Netherton Syndrome, a painful skin condition, have a missing gene, and trials are under way of a treatment that replaces it.

A small section of skin is taken from the patient, and manipulated in a lab where a gene containing a protein is added. The protein promotes stronger, healthier skin and, it is hoped, will boost protein levels throughout the body.

Netherton Syndrome affects one in every 800,000 people, with a handful of cases in the UK. Babies born with it often have red, ‘scalded-looking’ skin that peels easily.

One sufferer in ten does not live to see his or her first birthday. The condition also affects the immune system and hair growth, resulting in it being fragile and slow-growing.

Children with Netherton Syndrome are more susceptible to dehydration, infection and allergies, and are smaller and lighter than healthy children.

Now doctors at Great Ormond Street and Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospitals in London, who are behind the trials, say the graft could bring relief for those with the disorder.

‘Netherton Syndrome has a huge impact on people’s lives,’ says Dr Jemima Mellerio, a consultant in the dermatology department of Great Ormond Street Hospital. ‘Skin is inflamed, sore and peeling, and you can be open to infection. If successful, the skin grafts could potentially offer the first treatment for the condition rather than just managing the symptoms.’

People with Netherton Syndrome are lacking a gene called Spink5, which contains a protein known as lekti, usually found in the skin.

The protein plays an important role in the immune system by producing white blood cells called lymphocytes, which help the body respond to infection.

The lifelong condition usually improves as people get older, and some drugs and regular gentle washing and moisturising can help with symptoms.

The new graft involves taking a quarter-inch skin biopsy from the inside of the patient’s arm. This is processed in a lab where the missing gene is added. The genetically corrected skin is then grown to around the size of four postage stamps and grafted on to the patient’s thigh.

The hope is that once in place, the gene will produce lekti in the grafted skin, and increase levels of it throughout the body.

The protein plays a key role in the creation of the tough outer surface of the skin – the stratum corneum – which acts as a barrier between the body and the outside environment.

‘The protein strengthens the skin, effectively putting the brakes on the shedding process,’ Dr Mellerio adds.

‘In Netherton Syndrome, the skin sheds, leaving a thinner and more irritable layer exposed. This protein stops the top layer of the skin from shedding.

‘We think that production and release of lekti protein from even a small patch of skin will be beneficial for the patients, leading to increased levels of the protein throughout the body.’

The trials, which are expected to last at least two years, will first test out the treatment on adults, and later children.

Gene researchers at University College London, where the Spink5 gene was first identified as the cause of Netherton Syndrome 15 years ago, are also involved in the trial.
