Sony and Spotify are joining forces to take on Apple and Google in the online music battle.

The Stockholm streaming startup will replace Sony's music Unlimited service on smartphones and Playstation's, the two revealed today.

The move is a huge deal for Spotify, which recently revealed it has 15 million users, as Apple is believed to be preparing a relaunch of its Beats Music streaming service, rebranding it as part of the iTunes family.

The move will deliver Spotify to Sony's PlayStation Network and its 64 million active users around the world on PS3 and PS4 systems.

'We are incredibly honoured to partner with Sony and PlayStation to give gamers around the world an amazing experience wherever they listen to music,' said Daniel Ek, CEO and Founder, Spotify.

'As a gamer and PlayStation 4 user myself, I'm super excited to be able to soundtrack my FIFA 15 Arsenal matches later this spring.'

The move will deliver Spotify to Sony's PlayStation Network and its 64 million active users.

It will launch a new music destination in Spring 2015 called PlayStation Music, with Spotify as the exclusive partner. 

Sony's current Music Unlimited service will close in all 19 countries on March 29, 2015.

'Music is a core component of the entertainment offering that consumers expect from Sony, and our goal with PlayStation Music is to provide the most compelling music experiences to the millions of PlayStation Network users around the world,' said Andrew House, President and Group CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment.

'This partnership represents the best in music and the best in gaming coming together, which will benefit the vibrant and passionate communities of both Spotify and PlayStation Network. 

'We're thrilled to make Spotify the foundation of our strategy with PlayStation Music.' 

Spotify on PlayStation Music will offer more than 30 million songs and 1.5 billion playlists on PlayStation®4 (PS4™) and PlayStation®3 (PS3™) systems, as well as Xperia smartphones and tablets. 

PS4 owners will be able to use Spotify while playing games, enabling them to soundtrack their gaming sessions with their favorite songs playing in the background.

Users will be able to create a music collection and listen to playlists (including existing playlists from current Spotify users as well as Spotify curated playlists) and enjoy the service on all of Spotify's supported devices. 

Additionally, PS4 owners will be able to use Spotify while playing games, enabling them to soundtrack their gaming sessions with their favorite songs playing in the background.

Earlier this months online music streaming service Spotify said on Monday it had 15 million subscribers and 60 million active users at the end of 2014.

Stockholm-based Spotify, which sparked speculation related to an IPO after it re-advertised a job for a regulatory filings expert in August, provides free on-demand music or ad-free tunes for paying customers.

The company said in November its paying subscriber base had risen to 12.5 million from 10 million in May.

Rival Pandora Media Inc said in October it had 76.5 million active listeners as of Sept. 30.
