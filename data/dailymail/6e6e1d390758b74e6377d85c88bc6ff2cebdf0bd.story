Arsene Wenger insists Jack Wilshere's versatility will help him break back into the Arsenal side following four months on the sidelines.

The midfielder will be in the Gunners squad to face Crystal Palace for the first time since undergoing ankle surgery in November.

Given the raft of central midfield options at Wenger's disposal, and the emergence of Francis Coquelin, questions have been raised over how Wilshere fits into a full-strength Arsenal starting XI.

But Wenger says Wilshere's ability to play anywhere across midfield and the club's busy schedule will ensure the England international gets ample game time.

'He can play wide so that means he can play on the right, on the left and in the middle. With those positions there is fierce competition as well,' said the Gunners boss.

'When you look at our scheduling over the next month I'm happy with that as he will get games.

'In [Santi] Cazorla, [Mesut] Ozil, [Danny] Welbeck and [Alexis] Sanchez it is a very offensive team and that means you if take one out and Jack in, it is exactly the same.

'He is exactly the same player since he came back from injury. His advantage is to turn the game forward and to win the ball. And that's his game.'

Meanwhile, Wenger is unconcerned by reports that Atletico Madrid will target Santi Cazorla in the summer.

'He has extended his contract last year, and has two years to go. He was just 30.

'You know our policy at the club (offering 12 months contracts to players over 30). There's nothing to worry about.

'The suggestion is only a suggestion. We have never been approached by anybody about him.'
