For four decades, Sambany lived with a giant tumour growing from his neck.

At its heaviest the mass weighed a stone and measured twice the size of his head.

But after walking for three days, Sambany is finally free of the growth, after charitable medics performed a 12-hour operation to rid him of the tumour.

The procedure, one of the most life-changing performed by the team at Mercy Ships, saw doctors and nurses remove one of the biggest tumours the charity has seen in its 30-year history.

The operation took twice as long as expected and once removed, the team discovered the growth weighed a staggering 16.45lbs (7.46kg) tumour - just over a stone.

Sambany first noticed a swelling in his left cheek when he was in his 20s. The mass grew to weigh just over a stone and was twice the size of his head, when medics finally removed it four decades later

After hearing the international charity Mercy Ships had docked a vessel at the port of Toamasina in Madagascar, Sambany and his grandson walked for three days to reach the crew seeking help. He is pictured after the life-changing operation with British anaesthetist Dr Michael McBrien

Speaking ahead of his life-changing operation, Sambany, who is around 60 years old, but doesn't know his exact date of birth, said: 'My heart is very, very happy.

'I'm very happy. I'm just happy.

'I know without surgery I will die. I know I might die in surgery, but I already feel dead inside from the way I'm treated.

'I choose to have surgery.'

When he was in his 20s, Sambany, who is from a rural part of Madagascar, developed a swelling in his left cheek.

Gradually, as the tumour grew his head began to lean progressively the other way to cope with the weight of the mass.

The size of the tumour began to place growing pressure on his body, with his heart struggling to cope with the weight of the burden. 

When he arrived in the eastern port of Toamasina, Sambany had just one stop to make.

He sought out the Mercy Ship docked there, and appealed to the crew for help.

They faced a number of difficulties preparing for the operation, having never dealt with a tumour that size before.

But the expert volunteer crew, which included British anaesthetist Dr Michael McBrien, from Belfast, overcame the obstacles and were able to perform the procedure.

Speaking ahead of his operation Sambany said: 'I know without surgery I will die. I know I might die in surgery, but I already feel dead inside from the way I'm treated. I choose to have surgery'

Due to the size of the tumour the medical team on board the ship Africa Mercy faced difficulties screening Sambany before his operation 

Speaking after the operation, Dr McBrien, told MailIOnline: 'Sambany is one patient who I know I will remember forever. 

'Our surgical and anaesthetic team achieved something quite incredible, considering his age and the size of the tumour.

'It is amazing to think that this was made possible on a ship docked in the port of Toamasina - it is a wonderful thing to be a part of.

'In terms of recovery, Sambany has a long way to go.

'From the hospital staff, the on board crew, and the local day crew - hundreds of people have dedicated themselves to transforming Sambany's life, and this is something that will continue while he recovers.'

When Sambany caught sight of himself in the mirror for the first time since his operation, he was delighted.  

He exclaimed: 'I like it. I am happy.' 

Later that morning he was giving the thumbs up, and by the afternoon he was able to sit up in bed and play cards with his grandson.

He will remain on the ship for the next few months to recover from his surgery.

The grandfather first heard about the hospital ships through a friend.

But the team persevered and following a 12-hour operation Sambany was finally free of the tumour

Seeing himself in the mirror for the first time since the operation he exclaimed his delight, telling his grandson: 'I am happy'

There and then he made the decision to visit the crew of the Africa Mercy, with his grandson to see if they could help.

They walked for three days, before embarking on a four-hour car journey to reach the ship.  

Judy Polkinhorn, Executive Director of Mercy Ships UK, said: 'Thanks to the expert skill of our amazing volunteers Mercy Ships are able to carry out such incredible, life-changing surgeries. 

'I am so touched to hear about Sambany's story – he really epitomises what the charity is all about.'

Mercy Ships operates the Africa Mercy, a state-of-the-art hospital ship which carries out life-changing surgeries in some of the poorest countries in the world.

The ship is currently docked in Madagascar, providing medical care to the world's forgotten poor.
