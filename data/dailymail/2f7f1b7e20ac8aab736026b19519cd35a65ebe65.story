Director Cameron Crowe's latest star-studded film isn't due out until May and it's already being deemed a flop by Sony Pictures executives, hacked emails reveal.

Rachel McAdams, Alec Baldwin, Bill Murray, John Krasinski and Danny McBride have all signed on to play supporting characters, as well.

Panned by Pascal: Sony Pictures boss Amy Pascal, (right) wrote that she's expecting a flop from 'Almost Famous' director Cameron Crowe's new film, hacked emails reveal

Sony executives hate it, Gawker reports. 

'It's a wrap. There is no more to do. People don't like people in movies who flirt with married people or married people who flirt - specific plot points,' Sony Pictures co-chairman Amy Pascal writes in a terse email. e film, shouldn't expect to rake in much profit. 

'We have this movie in for a lot of dough and we better look at that,' Pascal writes. 

Her assessment of the movie - which was formerly called 'Deep Tiki' - was based on a series of test screenings that Sony did with audiences in New York City and Huntington Beach, California - a Los Angeles suburb.

Pascal believes that even red-hot names like Bradley Cooper (left) and Emma Stone (right) can't save the film from a problematic script

'Scores are same as last time and way way worse in ny,' Pascal writes.  

In the film industry, making movies is a financial gamble. Some are blockbusters, some are box office flops that don't break even. 

It seems Pascal is anticipating that Crowe's new film will be a flop before it's even released. 

And she believes the problem boils down to a weak script. 

'The satellite makes no sense/The gate makes no sense,' she says referring to scenes in the film.

'I'm never starting a movie again when the script is ridiculous. And we al (sic) know it. I don't care how much I love the director and the actors. It never. Not even once. Ever works.'

Crowe's last film was 'We Bought a Zoo' which enjoyed decent box office success and a mixed critical reaction. 

However, the director has had a history of major hits in the past - including 'Jerry Maguire,' 'Almost Famous,' 'Say Anything' and 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High.'
