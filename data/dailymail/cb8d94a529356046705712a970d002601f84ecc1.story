Mario Balotelli has been hungry for goals at Liverpool since joining in a £16million deal from Milan in the summer but the Reds striker has portrayed his predatory instincts in an altogether different manner.

The 24-year-old uploaded an Instagram picture of himself on Wednesday dressed in what appears to resemble a shark.

Along with the caption, '@pumarunnining #puma we are forever faster and different??' the enigmatic forward has his face covered by a shark hoodie and with two hangers representing his hands.

While his style can be questioned, the Italy forward has already proven popular on Merseyside with Liverpool fans already singing a chant in his honour despite his lack of goals.

Balotelli has only scored once in eight matches for the Reds this season - netting their opener in a 2-1 victory against Bulgarian side Ludogorets in the Champions League last month.

This poor statistic is one Balotelli is all too aware of that needs improving - especially in the Premier League where he has failed to break his duck in five games for the club.

Mario Balotelli was speaking in an exclusive interview with Sport Magazine

'I can see already that the Liverpool fans really like me, although I know that maybe they are a little upset because I don't score. I see they appreciate that I am working hard, though, which is nice for me,' he said in an exclusive interview with Sport magazine.

'I know I have one goal in the Champions League, but in the Premier League I have to start with one. After that, I might set myself a target, but I swear – right now my first league goal is my first and only objective.

'I need to get in the box more. I don't do it enough, but it is something I am working to try to do more. I have never been a real, out-and-out striker – I have always been someone who goes around the pitch, you know? 

The forward has been used largely as a lone striker by Reds boss Brendan Rodgers in the absence of Daniel Sturridge - who is expected to return from a thigh injury to face QPR on Sunday.

Sturridge's inclusion in the Liverpool squad is a boost to Balotelli, who revealed his preference is to play alongside another striker in the first-team.

'If it was my choice, I would always go with two strikers,' he added.

'It's the way I like to play, but Brendan asked me to play as the first striker. I understand that when the ball comes from wide on the left or right, I need to be in the box otherwise there might be no-one there at all.'

Balotelli's stuttering start has matched that of his new club, who have won three of their first seven league games.

However, the striker is confident things will improve and believes a strong English core can only help on the domestic front.

'I didn't really know much about the club before coming here, but I've been really surprised,' said the Italian, who spent two-and-a-half years at Manchester City before returning to his homeland.

'I knew they were a very good team but I didn't know they were as good as they are.

'Of course we need to improve many things because we have started off not very good but I think the players here are amazing.

'It's good to see young English players here too: (Raheem) Sterling, (Jordan) Henderson, (Adam) Lallana. I think the more players you have like this, the better.

'Maybe over time you have got used to not seeing so many good, young English players like that but now we are seeing some - it's good that they are in my team.'

The best English player in the striker's eyes remains Steven Gerrard, whom he compared to his veteran Italy team-mate Andrea Pirlo.

'Gerrard is an amazing player. I had really not seen much of him before this season, apart from for England, but wow!' Balotelli said.

'I think of him as being at the same level as Pirlo. Vision, technique, but he is powerful as well. Stevie can do anything.

'It's going to be very difficult for the team to find another player like him in the future.'
