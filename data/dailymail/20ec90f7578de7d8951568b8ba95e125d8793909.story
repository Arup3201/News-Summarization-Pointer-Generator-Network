Nazir Afzal, of the Crown Prosecution Service, has defended taking celebrities to trial over historic sex abuse claims

The chief Crown prosecutor who put Coronation Street actor William Roache in the dock over historic sex abuse claims has hit back at critics who accuse him of mounting a ‘witch-hunt’ against celebrities.

Nazir Afzal used the example of an investigation into Jimmy Savile, which took place in 2008, while he was still alive, and was not brought to trial, to justify putting Roache, 81, through four weeks in the dock.

He insisted he had no regrets and would continue to bring cases regardless ‘of who makes the complaint or who the complaint is against’.

Mr Afzal, head of the Crown Prosecution Service in the North West and the national leader on sexual exploitation of children, declined to comment on the Roache case after it ended in unanimous acquittals earlier this month.

But he told delegates at a Barnardo’s conference in Manchester: ‘I recognise that I’m damned if I do and damned if I don’t. Everybody now accepts the decisions taken back in 2008 over Jimmy Savile, for example, were wrong. We were the first to accept that in 2012.

‘But if we’d prosecuted in 2008 and the jury had acquitted, would people be saying, “You shouldn’t have brought those cases”?’

The prosecutor acknowledged that he had been hurt by the wave of criticism directed both at him and the CPS as a whole.

‘I’ve been called the Witchfinder General, the Celebrity Hunter and a host of other names. But criminal justice is not a ducking stool. It’s due process: proper, thorough investigation followed by a prosecutor review, continuing review and the testing of witnesses in acourtroom.’

Mr Afzal steered away from actually naming the Coronation Street actor, merely telling delegates:

‘There was a case last week in which a man went to trial innocent and left that trial innocent.’

Later in his speech he asked: ‘Do you all know the case I’m talking about?’ There were murmurs of assent among the delegates. The prosecutor suggested that, rather than being a disaster,  the Roache case had actually demonstrated the inherent fairness of Britain’s jury system.

‘I would not want to live in a country in which  everybody charged with an offence is convicted of that offence,’ he said.

Afzal said he approached the Roache case ‘like any other’.

‘What mattered were the allegations and the evidence and nothing else,’ he insisted. He went on to say: ‘It seems to have been overlooked by many that the trial judge, independent of prosecution and defence, decided that there was sufficient evidence for the case to progress.’

The criticism of Afzal is in stark contrast to the praise that has been heaped upon him in the past.

Both the Prime Minister and the Attorney General commended him for his decision to prosecute the Rochdale grooming gangs when others had baulked at doing so.

And his pursuit of Stuart Hall was so thorough the entertainer eventually had no option but to plead guilty to a series of historic sex attacks on girls as young as nine.
