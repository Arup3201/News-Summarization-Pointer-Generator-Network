QPR manager Harry Redknapp is to boost his Premier League squad by signing highly-rated midfielder Mark Davies from Bolton Wanderers this week.

Redknapp is anxious to increase his numbers at Loftus Road after training with only 15 senior players last week, including Loic Remy who is heading to Liverpool.

Davies, 26, also fits the younger age profile for new signings preferred by owner Tony Fernandes.

Fernandes allowed Redknapp to sign Rio Ferdinand last week on a Bosman free but does not want the squad to be a Dad's army.

Davies may initially join Rangers for a fee on a season-long loan until they see if they can preserve their top-flight status.

Swansea City failed in a Â£5million bid to sign him a year ago but this time Championship club Bolton have agreed to let him go and a deal should be finalised by the end of the week.
