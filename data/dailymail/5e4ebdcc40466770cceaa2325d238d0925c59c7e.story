Police have revealed new details about the unthinkable chain of events that led to a Las Vegas mother being shot dead in a road rage incident last Thursday, with the killer still on the loose.

At a press conference on Tuesday, Metro Police said Tammy Meyers, 44, was heading home from giving her daughter Kristal a driving lesson when a silver sedan sped up behind them.

The daughter was a passenger in the car, but leaned over to honk the horn, causing the sedan to pull in front of them.

Both cars stopped and, after a heated exchange, Meyers drove off home, where she told her daughter to go inside and get her 22-year-old son, Brandon.

Killed: Tammy Meyers - seen here with her husband Robert Meyers - went out looking for a man she had a road rage argument with, cops said. She was accompanied by their son Brandon, 22, who brought a gun with him, according to authorities

Son: Brandon Meyers, 22, posted a photo of a Beretta handgun (right) to his Facebook page one year ago, saying: 'New addition to the family.' Police say he shot at the fleeing car after his mom was gunned down

Shot dead: Mother-of-four Tammy Meyers, 44, went home first before heading back out to find the man that eventually killed her following a road rage incident last Thursday, police say

Vowed to find suspects: Mrs Meyers' husband, Robert Meyers, said his 15-year-old daughter Kristal is distraught. He believes the family's car and that of the suspect crashed at some point before the deadly shooting

He came and got into the car and brought a gun with him, police said, according to local station 8 News Now.

Meyers and her son drove around trying to find the silver sedan and eventually did.

Police have not elaborated on what happened at this point. 

However they say the driver of the sedan then followed Meyers home and shot her in the head outside the house.

The shooter is not believed to have gotten out of his vehicle. 

Myers' son fired shots at the fleeing car with his handgun as his mother lay dying nearby.

Meyers died Saturday after being taken off life support.

A candlelight vigil was held on Tuesday evening outside Walter Johnson Junior High School, where Meyers had been giving her 15-year-old daughter a driving lesson in the parking lot.

'I did what I had to do to protect my family. And I'd do it for anyone I love,' said Brandon Meyers, reports Review Journal.

Daughter Kristal told the 75 or so people at the vigil: 'I was in the car with her. There's so much I can say about my mom.

‘My mom was protecting me that night and she was doing what any mom would do. She was my everything, my best friend. She did everything she could possibly do to protect me and I love her so much.'

Police have not named the suspect, but have released a sketch of a person they are looking for. 

He has been described as a white man in his mid-20s, standing 6-feet tall, weighing about 180 pounds with spiked dirty blond hair and blue or hazel eyes. 

They have also released CCTV footage of the silver sedan that were captured on cameras near the crime scene. 

Meyers' bereaved husband has vowed to find the suspect, and the two other accomplices who were in the car along with him.

'My word to them is I hope the cops find them first and it’s not me,' Robert Meyers said. 

'I have four kids. I just want to let you suspects know you took a mom away.' 

'This was a loving mother of four kids teaching our daughter how to drive.

'After I turn off the machines to my wife today... we've got to do something to take our city back,' he said. 

'Every time you turn around, someone is getting shot.'

Overreaction: Police say one of the passengers in this car shot dead 44-year-old mother Tammy Meyers after getting into a road rage argument on Thursday

Meyers had let her daughter Kristal take the wheel of the family's green Buick Park Avenue in a nearby school parking lot before the incident with the sedan.

Mr Meyers described the girl as emotionally distraught, according to ABC News.

He also confirmed their son fired several shots with a handgun.

Mr Meyers said he thinks at least one 9mm shot fired by his 23-year-old son hit the fleeing car, and he called for the assailants to surrender to police. 

In February 2014, Brandon Meyers posted a photo of a Beretta handgun to his Facebook page, along with the caption: 'New addition to the family.' 

Las Vegas police were sorting through conflicting reports and descriptions of the car that fled the scene, Officer Miguel Garcia said.

Investigators were looking for the shooter and possibly two other men in the vehicle.

Mr Meyers, 49, said he was in Los Angeles on business when the shooting occurred. 

He said he believed the two cars crashed at some point; the Buick had slight damage to molding on the passenger side. 

'This was a loving mother of four kids teaching our daughter how to drive,' Robert Meyers told the AP before addressing reporters outside their home (pictured) where the shooting happened about 11:30 p.m. Thursday. 'After I turn off the machines to my wife today ... we've got to do something to take our city back'
