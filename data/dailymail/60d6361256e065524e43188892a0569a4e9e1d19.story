A babysitter killed a toddler she was supposed to be caring for five years before the two year old's body was found buried beneath a house, a coroner has ruled.

Mandy Martyn tied Daniel to his bed, locked him in cupboards, gagged and beat him and held his head under water during six weeks of torture in the lead-up to his death, Victorian coroner Jacinta Heffey ruled.

Daniel Thomas's mother Donna was also implicated in the tragic case for not doing enough to protect the boy in the Victorian town of Myrtleford, northeast of Melbourne.

Donna Thomas has been blamed by a coroner for not doing enough to protect her son Daniel, who was found buried under a house five years after he went missing

The two-year-old died on or about October 13, 2003, from the abuse suffered at the hands of his babysitter Ms Martyn, Ms Heffey said.

'His death was caused by Mandy Martyn, who inflicted the injuries that led to his death,' she told the Victorian Coroners Court on Thursday.

'Donna Thomas contributed to his death by her inaction and her failure to protect her son.'

She and Daniel moved into Ms Martyn's Myrtleford home about six weeks before he died, and throughout the period, Daniel was subjected to horrific abuse, Ms Heffey said.

'Daniel was exposed to cruelty amounting to torture,' she said in her findings.

Ms Heffey said Ms Thomas failed her son by remaining in the home and allowing the abuse to continue.

'She remained under the same roof as someone who systematically mistreated her own son and she manifestly failed to protect or console him,' she said.

'She chose to do nothing and allow the abuse to Daniel to continue.'

Ms Heffey found Daniel's death was possibly caused by strangulation, drowning or a head injury but did not make a ruling on a specific cause.

A coroner has blamed Donna Thomas for her role in Daniel Thomas's death in 2003. She has not been charged.

Police have never charged a killer but Detective Senior Sergeant Stuart Bailey told reporters after the discovery of Daniel's body the investigation was ongoing.

Daniel's father, Kevin Ruffels, hugged family members after the finding was delivered.

After the hearing Mr Ruffels said he had always blamed Martyn, who has never been charged over the the boy's death more than a decade ago.

'She was obviously the one all along we thought was the main suspect so I hope she goes to hell,' he said outside court.

'There's no closure until Mandy gets her right whack, she gets charged hopefully, and sentenced to many years in prison.'

Mr Ruffels said he was shocked Donna Thomas was also named as a contributor to Daniel's death.

Daniel was reported missing by Martyn in October 2003. His remains were found in 2008, buried under the Myrtleford home where he and his mother had previously lived.

Ms Martyn was not in court and was excused from giving evidence at the inquest.
