A rabbit named Ralph has reclaimed his crown as the world's fattest Easter bunny after munching his way to almost FOUR stone in weight.

Hungry Ralph, aged four, held the title in 2010 before being overtaken by fellow Continental Giant Darius, who ballooned to three-and-a-half stone.

Owner Pauline Grant says Ralph, who is over three-foot long and weighs more than an average three-year-old child, now tips the scales at 3-st 8lbs.

Pauline said: 'Ralph has matured now and is the heaviest he has ever been. He is fine and healthy. The worst thing is that he is malting at the moment so everyone is covered in rabbit hairs.

'His diet has not changed much over the years. I have been told by one or two vets that I should not give him all the food but it does not seem to give him any harm.

'He is fit and healthy.'

Ralph's mother Amy was recognised in the Guinness Book of Records as the world's biggest rabbit before she died four years ago.

Big foot: Ralph feasts on a diet of cabbage, broccoli, corn on the cob, sweetcorn, half a cucumber, a carrot, half a bag of watercress, two sweet apples, two slices of brown bread topped off by 
Weetabix with cream crackers every single day.

Dad Roberto is also a former holder of the record after weighing in at 3-stone 5lbs.

Pauline spends an incredible Â£50 pounds of her weekly shopping budget just to feed Ralph's enormous appetite.

He feasts on a diet of cabbage, broccoli, corn on the cob, sweetcorn, half a cucumber, a carrot with a top, half a bag of watercress, two sweet apples, two slices of brown bread and Weetabix with cream crackers every single day.

Pauline cares for him at the Sussex Horse Rescue in Uckfield, East Sussex and relies on donations from visitors to foot the bill.

She
 added: 'We have got a big place here and he can go anywhere he wants. 
He has a fantastic life and is not just kept in a hut. His diet is 
incredible.

It is all dear at the moment. But it is worth it. We have him know and his welfare is paramount for us.

'He will not get any bigger now.

'Our
 visitors really like him and are fascinated by him and his family. His 
mother was in the Guinness book of records which they love. He is a big 
celebrity.'
