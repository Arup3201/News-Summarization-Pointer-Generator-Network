It is without doubt one of the most iconic symbols of the American Government - but while it may look good from a distance, it is in desperate need of a makeover.

The U.S Capitol dome will be covered in scaffolding for around two years after it was announced today that the 150-year-old structure will undergo its first major restoration for more than 50 years.

The Architect of the Capitol, the federal post responsible for maintaining the historic building, said that more than 1,300 cracks and other structural problems need desperate attention.

Much needed repairs: The U.S Capitol dome is to be shrouded in scaffolding for two years as it undergoes a $59million makeover

Damage: Around 1,300 cracks in the famous dome will need to be repaired during the two year period

Wear and tear: Experts say that the structural damage is due to weathering rather than an after effect of an earthquake which hit DC in 2011

Stephen T. Ayers said in a statement: 'Under the paint, age and weather have taken its toll.'

The restoration is expected to cost around $59.6million.

According to Mr Ayers spokesman, Justin Kieffer, the damage to the dome is not the result of the earthquake which hit Washington DC in 2011 and damaged other structures, including the Washington Monument.

Repairs on the Capitol dome are not expected to affect legislative 
business and are being designed to minimally affect tours and other 
events.Â 

When possible, the architect's office said, repairs will be 
done at night and on weekends.

Inside the Capitol Rotunda, a 
doughnut-shaped canopy will be built to protect visitors from 
construction debris and will ensure the Apotheosis of Washington, a 
fresco painting in the center of the Capitol, can still be seen.

Minimal disruption: The Architect of the Capitol, which is in charge of overseeing all congressional grounds, said most of the construction will happen during nights and weekends

Regular updates: The Architect of the Capitol's office plans to post regular updates on the construction on its website

In a similar way to the Washington Monument during restoration work on that, the dome's scaffolding will be lit up at night.

The dome was lasted given a facelift back in 1960 - just in time for the beginning of John F Kennedy's Presidency.

Then the dome temporarily turned red - workmen removed paint from the iron dome and had to paint a red rust inhibiting coating on its surface.

The Capitol building is not the only famous Washington DC landmark to undergo repairs.

As well as the Washington Monument, which was damaged in the 2011 earthquake, the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, where many White House staff work, recently shed its scaffolding after years of repair.

The building has been the home of at the centre of American Government since the first Congress sat there in 1800.

Its construction was based on a revised version of architect William Thornton's design inspired by the east front of the Louvre in Paris.

It was built at the east end of the National Mall on a plateau some 88 feet above the level of the Pontomac River.

The building covers around four acres and has more than 600 rooms.

Since it was built, the Capitol Building has been partially burned down, rebuilt, extended and restored.
