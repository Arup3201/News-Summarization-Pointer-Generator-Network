Manchester United and Arsenal have been told they can sign Cesc Fabregas if they are willing to offer £45million.

United failed in a similar bid last year with the 27-year-old Barcelona midfielder keen to stay at the Camp Nou.

Back again: United failed in a similar bid for the Cesc Fabregas last summer, but could return again

His position remains the same but the club expect a summer of change and his prospective sale plus that of Alexis Sanchez could represent the best way of generating income for the pending changes.

Javier Mascherano, Daniel Alves, Pedro and Cristian Tello will also be sold if the right offers arrive.

Meanwhile, United midfielder Shinji Kagawa is unlikely to leave Old Trafford in the summer, his agent has said.

Speaking before the DFB Pokal final between Dortmund and Bayern Munich on Saturday, Thomas Kroth told kicker that Kagawa, 25, had no immediate plans to move on. Kroth said: 'Shinji will play the World Cup now and then see what the new Manchester United manager's plans are. Right now, it is rather unlikely that he will leave the club in the summer.'

Southampton have added Swansea left-back Neil Taylor to their list of potential replacements for Luke Shaw.

Taylor, 25, wants regular first team football after making just 19 appreances this season due to injury and the form of Ben Davies.

He was the subject of a £4million bid from Fulham in January but Swansea kept hold of the Wales international.

Asked about his future, Taylor said: 'I'm going to have a holiday with my family and think about it over the summer. But I'm contracted to the club and that's as far as my thinking goes.

'I can't say whether I expect to be here or not - players don't know as much as you think. I can't tell you what's going to happen because I don't know.

'A lot of players say I want out, I want this or that, but I'm contracted to a football club: they pay your wages and I'll do what's asked of me. And this is a club that's been good to me down the years so it's important you do the best you can, whatever the situation. They pay my wages and fans travel I don't know how many miles to watch us.'

Replacement: Swansea's Neil Taylor could fill in for Luke Shaw at Southampton

There could be plenty of changes at Swansea this summer with Ashley Williams considering his future, goalkeeper Michel Vorm wanted by Liverpool and striker Wilfried Bony on the list of potential targets for Liverpool and Arsenal.

Southampton will lose Shaw to Manchester United and have already considered Nice left-back Timothee Kolodziejczak, as revealed in Sportsmail, but he will be more expensive at around £7million. Taylor may be allowed to go for £5m with add-ons.

 

Eden Hazard remains on Paris St Germain's wishlist this summer. The uneasy truce struck between the Belgian and coach Jose Mourinho has given the French champions a belief they can prise him away from Stamford Bridge and maintain an interest in his teammate David Luiz.

Despite being rapped on the knuckles for their overspending by UEFA, albeit not as harshly as Manchester City, PSG are making plans to offload Ezequiel Lavezzi, Javier Pastore and Marco Verratti to balance the books while Edinson Cavani is keen to leave too.

PSG's alternatives to Hazard include Pedro at Barcelona and Angel di Maria at Real Madrid.

Malaga's hopes of a cut-price deal for Leeds United striker Ross McCormack have been dashed after the crisis-torn Championship club set an £8million price tag on their top scorer.

The Spanish side have a genuine interest in the Scotland international but were hoping to strike a bargain as Leeds continue to cut their costs ahead of facing winding-up orders and having their main bank account frozen.

Owner Massimo Cellino is in talks to sell his other club Cagliari to Inter Milan director Tommaso Giulini for a reported £40m this week insisting he intends to save Leeds.

The chaos at Elland Road has brought plenty of twists and turns for staff and fans.

Goalkeeper Jamie Ashdown learned on Twitter that he had been released before receiving his formal letter on Saturday that confirmed he would not be getting a new contract.

SEM agency advisor Dave Sheron has been toasting a successful end of season. Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes, who has revived his career since leaving Bristol City, won Scotland's manager of the year and their football writers' award while Crystal Palace's miracle man Tony Pulis won the LMA's award for Premier League manager of the year.

Sheron is an advisor to both McInnes and Pulis and is also helping former Liverpool defender Sami Hyypia. The genial Hyypia is still such a popular figure at Anfield that fans started trending #ohsamisami on Monday in tribute to the fact that he signed for Liverpool 15 years ago from Willem II.

However, it is his managerial career that Sheron is helping Hyypia to shape. The 40-year-old Finn was sacked by Bayer Leverkusen despite guiding them towards a Champions League qualification position and is now looking at opportunities in England. West Bromwich Albion, Norwich and Brighton have all taken note of Hyypia's availability and the contacts he can bring.

Arsenal look to have secured teenager Chris Willock after extensive contract talks.

The 16-year-old midfielder was wanted by Manchester United who have his older brother Matty on their books. However, Arsenal are understood to have offered a lucrative deal to ensure the England U16 international stays at The Emirates where he has already taken part in training with the first team.

Willock is now due to sign his first professional deal. His younger brother Joe, 13, is also an exciting prospect emerging at Arsenal.
