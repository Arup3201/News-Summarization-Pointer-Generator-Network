The head of U.S. special operations has concluded that the claims made by former Navy SEAL Matt Bissonnette about Osama bin Laden's last moments are incorrect and do not convey an accurate assessment of the al-Qaeda chiefs killing.

The chief of U.S. special forces has re-examined the claims of Matt Bissonnette, who wrote 'No Easy Day' and recounts a different version of events of the death of Osama bin Laden

Admiral William McRaven took the personal step of contacting members of the Navy SEAL Team Six that stormed the Abbottabad, Pakistan compound of bin Laden, to rebut claims made by Bissonnette that contradicted the official account of the May 2011 raid.

In his book on the raid, 'No Easy Day', Bissonnette said that bin Laden was on the floor having already been shot when he and other SEALs entered his room, having been fired upon by another SEAL when he craned his head into the hall as the team approached.

Bissonnette's book claims that when he entered the room bin Laden's body was already lying at the foot of the bed, twitching and convulsing and that the SEALs, including Bissonnette shot him in the chest until he was motionless.

Because this version of events differs from the account that the White House and other U.S. officials have given, Adm. McRaven, the head of U.S. Special Operations Command personally went back to the head of Team Six to examine the contradicting claims.

Following this, senior Pentagon officials told CNN that the conclusions they reached were that Bissonnette was wrong in his version of events.

They re-confirmed that the al-Qaeda leader was standing in his room when the SEALs entered and they shot him then, as he was able to access weapons that were already in the room.

Despite the fact that bin Laden was unarmed, the SEALS had come under heavy fire as they made their way through the house to reach him and bin Laden showed no signs of surrendering.

Even though the Pentagon's and Bissonnette's versions diverge at the point of encountering bin Laden, the officials who spoke with CNN said it was possible that the former SEAL simply never saw bin Laden standing because he was a few seconds behind the lead team members.

It still has not been made clear if the initial shots fired by the leading SEAL member hit bin Laden when he looked out of his room. The officials told CNN that they believe the shots missed.

However, whatever the truth of the bin Laden raid, Bissonnette's decision to publicly come forward and tell his story has reportedly led to him being ostracised by his former special forces comrades.

Adm. William McRaven took the claims of Bissonnette, (seen in 
this photo talking to TV show 60 Minutes) so seriously that he went straight to the lead SEAL of Team Six to lead another debriefing on the mission

Having broken ranks, Bissonnette will be struck from invitations to annual events for retired and active SEALs, who act as a secretive and closely knit band of brothers.

'The guys who run their mouths are typically not invited back to these things,' a retired senior Navy officer familiar with the SEAL culture told The Washington Times.

'These guys are not really welcomed in many places in the ‘spec’ war community. The entire SEAL community has made these guys unwelcomed at their gatherings.'

Another anonymous officer who maintains contacts with serving SEALs said that 'No Easy Day' violated the basic SEAL creed.

'They’re not going to buy the book. Most of the guys are pissed off [by] the fact that he would disclose the operation.' said the insider.

He claimed to be out to tell the truth on the raid that killed Osama bin Laden.

However, it has also been claimed that Bissonnette could actually have been motivated by revenge - on his own comrades.

A rival book alleges that Matt Bissonnette, who wrote ‘No Easy Day’, had ‘bad blood’ between his former colleagues and commanders because he was kicked out of the unit.

‘No Easy Op’ claims that the soldier was ‘ostracised’ when he inquired about leaving the Navy to start a business and was sent home suddenly before quitting.

Feeling scorned Bissonnette could have penned his novel as a way of getting back at the military in which he served for 14 years with distinction.

No Easy Day, which is in book stores, is the first account of the bin Laden operation from a member of the squad who was there.

But it has proved controversial because Bissonnette, writing under the pseudonym Mark Owen, did not seek approval from the authorities before he wrote it.

It also disagrees with the official White House version of events which was put out at the time and has caused the Obama administration consternation.

According to the New York Times, the book says that Bissonnette was ‘repaid for his honesty and 14 years of service’ with nothing but rejection.

It claims he was ‘ostracized from his unit with no notice and handed a plane ticket back to Virginia from a training operation’, before eventually leaving.

The book says: ‘In the infantry-bred world of Army Special Operations, no one wants to hear braggarts telling tall tales of their heroics,’

No Easy Op has been written by sofrep.com, a web site for former Special Operations team members.

Brandon Webb, a former SEAL sniper who founded the site, said that the book was the product of conversations he and others had with serving members of the bin Laden team, although none of them are identified.

Talking to the New York Times, Mr Webb refused to say whether Bissonnette was involved in No Easy Op, even though he has spoken to him in the past.

Mission: The Al Qaeda leader was killed at this 
compound in Abbottabad by U.S. Special Forces - and Matt Bissonette 
claims that if SEAL Team 6 had never made it there they were to explain 
that they were searching for an unmanned drone to their Pakistani allies

Tension: The raid of bin Laden's Abottabad 
compound was watched by President Obama and his closest advisers in the 
Situation Room of the White House

In a statement, Kevin Maurer, one of the co-authors of No Easy Day said: ‘After spending several very intense months working with Mark Owen on this book, I know that he wrote this book solely to share a story about the incredible men and women defending America all over the world.

‘Any suggestion otherwise is as ill informed as it is inaccurate.

‘What’s more, Mark has an unshakable respect for the US military, in particular the men he served with.

‘That’s why not one negative word was written about anyone he served with.’
