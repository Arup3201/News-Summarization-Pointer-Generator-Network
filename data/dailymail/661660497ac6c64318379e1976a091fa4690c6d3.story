Chocolate lovers: Brits spend an average of £348 a year on chocolate, spending £2.23 a day

Brightonians buy more chocolate per person than any other area in the country, spending £672 a year 

That figure is closely followed by fans of the 'food of the gods' in Liverpool and Oxford, who spent £587 and £583 a year respectively on the sweet stuff.

London and Winchester came in fourth (£580 a year) and fifth (£556 a year) leaving the North of the country well and truly behind in the chocolate stakes.

The figures were revealed by online food marketplace Yumbles. Its research also discovered that 74 per cent of chocolate buyers are women, who prefer milk and caramel-filled products.

1. Brighton - £672 a year

2. Liverpool - £587 a year

3. Oxford - £583 a year

4. London - £580 a year

5. Winchester - £556 a year

Hull and Edinburgh were identified as male 'hotspots'; in both towns men were responsible for 56 per cent and 58 per cent of chocolate purchases respectively, preferring to buy dark chocolate. 

The past year has seen a dramatic increase in the sales of unusual flavour combinations too, as the nation becomes ever more adventurous with its chocolate choices.

Combination chocolates such as cardamom with vanilla were snapped up 54 per cent more regularly in the last 12 months, and mulberries with hemp was up 45 per cent.

And it's not just chocolate itself which is growing in popularity. 

Chocolate-flavoured products were also in high demand with sales of gourmet peanut butter and chocolate marshmallows up 130 per cent on last year and chocolate and raspberry jam up 98 per cent. 

The fastest growing flavours of 2014 have thus far been the more innovative and distinct tastes. 

Chocolatier's 23-carat gold chocolate proved extremely popular amongst women with demand up 320 per cent. 

Sales of spicy chocolate with  ginger and chilli flakes were up 180 per cent and raw chocolate was up 105 per cent since the beginning of the year.

Yumbles founders, husband and wife team Simos and Katie Kitiris Simos said: 'It's great to see the nation is becoming more adventurous with their chocolate choices. 

A significant number of people are now looking for ever more unusual chocolate choices, the study revealed 

Popularity: 74% of chocolate buyers are women, who prefer milk and caramel-filled products

'Of course Dairy Milk and other old favourites are still much-loved but a significant number of people are now looking for ever more unusual chocolate choices. 

'From raw chocolate that suits vegans and the health conscious to chocolate that packs a punch with chilli and ginger, we are starting to really experiment.

'Chocolate need not be an unhealthy indulgence either, with a cup of cocoa containing double the number of antioxidants as a cup of green tea and the smell of chocolate scientifically proven to promote relaxation, there's always an excuse to buy more chocolate.' 

The couple founded Yumbles a curated online marketplace connecting food lovers with the UK's best indpendent food and drink producers. 

The average of £348 was across the 1,044 people who  took part in the Yumbles poll. The research also revealed  an increase of 14 per cent in chocolate sales on the previous twelve months.
