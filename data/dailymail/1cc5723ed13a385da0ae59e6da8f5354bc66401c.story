A callous thief stole a pot of money belonging to a severely disabled man by posing as his carer.

Patrick McKinlay, 25, who has spina bifida and uses a wheelchair, accidentally left his pot of money at the Tesco Extra café in Barrow, Cumbria.

Staff at the store, where Mr McKinlay is a regular, noticed the pot had been left behind on the table and put it behind the counter for safe-keeping. The pot contained between £8 and £9.

Staff at the store, where Mr McKinlay (pictured with his mother) is a regular, noticed the pot had been left behind and put it behind the counter for safe-keeping, but a man falsely claimed to be the young man's carer 

But, minutes later, a thief tricked staff into handing over the money, by claiming he was Mr McKinlay's carer.  

The man even gave a detailed description of the pot in order to convince staff that the item should be handed over. He then left the store. 

The young man's mother Carole McKinlay, 58, said it was 'frightening' to think that the thief could have been watching her son and his carer before carrying out the crime.

Carole McKinlay, 58, said it was 'frightening' to think the thief could have been watching her son before the incident 

She said: 'Patrick has a little pot of money that he carries with him whenever he goes to town so he can buy DVDs or a bag of chips or a cup of tea.

'It's his little thing that he does. It upset him because he couldn't get the DVD that he wanted because he didn't have the money.

'He couldn't understand that he didn't have the money any more.

'I was quite frightened that someone would pretend to be his carer, they must have been watching him.

'I was quite disgusted that someone could do that to be honest.' 

The suspect is described as a slim white male with black hair. The incident occurred between 2.30pm and 3pm on Friday, November 14. 

Mrs McKinlay has now urged any witnesses to come forward.

She said: 'I'd just like to say if anyone knows anything about it or if they were there on the day and might have seen something please come forward.'

Sergeant John McIntosh of Barrow Police said: 'What makes this crime so unusual is the impact it's had on the victim.

'Hopefully this appeal to the members of the public will help bring the perpetrator to justice.'

Anyone with information about the incident is asked to call Cumbria Police on 101 and ask to speak to PC 2063 Callum Lennox. 

A Tesco spokesman said: 'We were sorry to hear about this incident and we value Patrick as a regular visitor to our store. We’ll be helping the Police with their investigation.'
