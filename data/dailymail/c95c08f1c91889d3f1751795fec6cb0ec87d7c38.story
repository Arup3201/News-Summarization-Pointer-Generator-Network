Host commentator

Stuart Fraser: Job done, Andy Murray. He came out here knowing he had to win and he delivered. Getting it done in straight sets will also help too.

All to play for in Group B on Thursday as Murray plays Federer and Raonic takes on Nishikori. Lot of qualification scenarios involved and I'm afraid it's a bit of a mathematical maze...

Murray tells Sky Sports: 'It's nice. Last year was tough but I'm very happy to be back. The court atmosphere has been unbelievable. Nice match to look forward to against Roger now. 

Murray started the game off by answering a net call with one of his own and it proved too good for Raonic. More unforced errors from the Canadian made Murray's life easier before going to deuce.

Raonic pulled back two match points before Murray finally put him to the sword with another strong serve which Raonic can only hit long. 

That's more like it from Murray! The Scot played the return of the match, sprinting across the baseline before whipping the ball across Raonic and it seemed to rattle the Canadian as the crowd sensed weakness.  

He will serve for the match! 

Murray serves out well. It's been a long time coming, but it looks like we've got a game on here. 

Raonic wins the following game with a fine serve out of Murray's reach as he continues to send Murray around the court and back again. 

Murray serves to stay in the second set...

Murray gets away with a soft serve as Raonic hits the net with his forehand. The Canadian has the upper-hand in the set.

Mike Dickson: You can see how the confidence permeated back into Raonic after he broke back and I’d say Murray’s best hope here is to cling on for a tiebreak.

Raonic smashes his way through another service game without losing a point. The 23-year-old looks to finally be gaining some confidence. 

Murray holds it together to bring the score level once again thanks to another unforced error from his opponent. 

Raonic battles through another games and survives a couple of deuces. The Canadian is starting to turn the screw here.  Raonic wins the games with a lovely backhand volley.

Stuart Fraser: Tremendous moment during last changeover as DJ plays Fatboy Slim - Rockafeller Skank and the big screen cuts to an elderly gentleman in the crowd with his fingers in his ears.

I'm sure he would also not approve of the way both players dropped serve in consecutive games there...

Murray is absolutely furious with himself as he allows Raonic back into this set. The Scot sent a backhand wide after brilliant work from Raonic at the net. 

The Sky Sports presenters are forced to apologise as the microphones pick up Murray shouting, 'every f****** time' as the Scot miss-hits a return and is punished. 

Raonic was 40-0 up but Murray battled back before the Canadian looked to have hit a woman with his serve while at Deuce.  

Raonic hit the following serve well wide and couldn't regain his composure as yet another unforced error gives Murray the game. 

Murray continues to hold without any real threat to his serve. 

Stuart Fraser: Roger Federer will no doubt be following this one with interest. Anything other than a Murray straight sets victory and the Swiss qualifies for the semis tonight.

If Murray does go on to win this in straights, then it's all still to play for in Group B on Thursday.

Mike Dickson: The usual smattering of footballers not present this evening but 17,500 crowd getting right behind Murray.

A solid performance from him in the first set and he’s profited from the wayward forehand of Raonic, whose first serve has missed too often to cause what would only be a mini upset. As against Federer, you’d expect Raonic to improve in this set.

Raonic holds his serve well to take the first game of the second set. He didn't start the game well but ended with a nice volley and a serve that proved too hot to handle for Murray. 

Raonic made the final game of the set a difficult one, but Murray got the points on the board early enough to see it out.

The Scot looks a different player from the one that lost to Nishikori on Sunday. 

Raonic won't go down in a fight, particularly when he's got that huge serve. The Canadian hits some big serves and actually started to make Murray run around a little bit.

Murray hits a return long to have Raonic the game. Muzza will serve for the set. 

Stuart Fraser: 'Just a sick slice,' says the Canadian behind me as Murray plays one of his trademark shots with plenty of spin down the line. I wholeheartedly agree.

Moments later, Murray has the first break of the match. Raonic looking cagey on his forehand side.

That will go down as Murray's easiest game of the night so far. The Scot seems to have got a real adrenalin rush from his previous break and Raonic much now serve to stay in the set.  

Murray earns himself the break and pumps his fist towards the crowd. Raonic has played several wide shots tonight. His latest coming in the sixth game from what should have been an easy smash.

He's also only getting 33 per cent of his first serves in. Murray on the other hand is looking more and more up for it. 'Come on, fire up' he shouts. 

Mike Dickson: Murray couldn't have asked for more than two second serves on those break points, you don't get many opportunities against the giant Canuck. Crowd noticeably more partisan tonight.

Murray continues to hold his serve and looks to be getting in the groove now. The Scot player an excellent forehand to beat Raonic before a delightful backhand slice saw the Canadian scrambling for the ball. 

Raonic does well to keep his cool and win four points in a row to stop Murray from an early break in the first.

The big Canadian made two unforced errors before battling back and using that big serve to his advantage.

Murray makes hard work of the third set but the British No 1 wins it quite brilliantly with a drop shot which Raonic can only hit out of the court. 

Both players are taking a while to get going, particularly Raonic, who seems a tad nervous.  

Raonic answer with his own hold and hit couple of pretty un-returnable serves as you'd expect from the big-hitter. Murray looked a little sluggish during that one. 1-1!

Murray wins the first game with relative ease. The Scot showed some brilliant handling and kept Raonic on the move which will be crucial this evening. He finished the game off with an ace.

Judy Murray is in the audience with Strictly Come Dancing partner Anton du Beke. Let's hope Murray's performance isn't as stiff as his mother's...

Stuart Fraser: The pre-show in the arena is always impressive. A stirring video message from John McEnroe, a dazzling lights show and then the players walk out onto court in a boxing-style entrance.

In fact, even the umpire has his moment as he is introduced to the crowd as he walks out!

Murray wins the coin toss and elects to serves first. It's a positive step as he looks to get in the lead early on. The pair are currently going through the rally warm-ups. 

Murray tells Sky Sports: 'Hopefully I'll hit the ball better than I did the other day. I'll need to play, hopefully get a lot of returns back. If I can make it tough for Raonic on his service games, that's half the battle.'

Mike Dickson: After his dreadful performance on Sunday against Kei Nishikori I see two reasons for optimism around Murray tonight: Firstly he tends to play better when his back is against the wall and he wants to prove people wrong, which is the case tonight.

Also, Roger Federer said after his match that he thinks this court is difficult to blast your way out of trouble on with the serve, due to its sluggish speed, so perhaps that main weapon for Raonic might not be as potent as usual. Another full house for the evening so there ought to be no lack of atmosphere as Murray tries to survive.

Stuart Fraser: Not the best quality doubles match but entertaining nonetheless as Ivan Dodig and Marcelo Melo beat Marcel Granollers and Marc Lopez in two tiebreaks. Audible gasps in the press centre at some of those missed volleys...

We now await the arrival of Andy Murray and Milos Raonic.

The O2 Arena crowd are being made to wait for the start of Murray's match, but they don't mind be the sounds of it as the Dodig/Melo vs Granollers/Lopez doubles match is currently throwing up a fantastic tie-break decider. 

Stuart Fraser: After a hectic run of 23 matches in 37 days to qualify for the ATP World Tour Finals, Andy Murray faces the possibility that this tournament may effectively be over for him on day three.

After Roger Federer's victory over Kei Nishikori this afternoon, Murray has to beat Milos Raonic tonight if he is to go into Thursday's match against Federer still with a chance to go through to the semi-finals.

It's squeaky bum time, as one of Murray's fellow Scots once famously said...

Federer picked up his second win of the week earlier this morning with a straight sets victory against Murray's conqueror Nishikori.

Federer made the most of Nishikori's erratic play to secure a 6-3, 6-2 victory and move closer to a semi-final spot while increasing the pressure on Murray.
