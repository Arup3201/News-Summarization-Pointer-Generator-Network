Forests can typically take around 100 years to reach maturity, if they're left to their own devices.

But one eco-entrepreneur has managed to make the process ten times faster, creating green areas that are 30 times denser than a traditional forest.

Shubhendu Sharma, from Uttaraskhand in India, devised his system after a chance encounter with Japanese forester Akira Miyawaki.

Mr Sharma was working at carmaker Toyota when he signed up as for a Miyawaki-led programme to create a green space for the company.

He believed he could standardise the process to make the forest cost just over £500 ($800) - or around the cost of an iPhone.

By combining Mr Miyawaki's knowledge with his efficiency of industrial processes he managed to transform a 1,000 square foot (93 square metre) plot into a lush, green area.

The process involves analysing the soil to find out what species of tree will grow best in the area.

Saplings, which can reach up to 2ft 7 inches (80cm) high, are then planted, with three to five saplings per square metre.

As the trees grow, they become denser and after about eight months, the forest becomes self-sustaining.

In the first three years, the forest needs to be weeded, but after that it's left alone for an ecosystem for develop.

In just two years of planting in his own garden, Mr Sharma had 300 trees, 42 species, of which 18 bore fruit, and 17 species of bird in an area where there had previously just been two.

'Our guava trees produce so much fruit that we harvest at least 5kg [11lb] a day. 

'All my neighbours are getting guava nectar because we have such an abundance,' Mr Sharma told Jane Wakefield at the BBC.

Mr Sharma now has his own company, Afforestt, which has, so far, planted 43,000 trees for 33 clients based in India.

In cities, he claims mini-forests could help combat pollution and reduce the heating caused by concrete in large urban areas absorbing sunlight.

'Our plan is to automate the system so that we can give anyone anywhere in the world step-by-step instructions on how to plant a native forest,' Mr Sharma told Ted blogs.

'We plan to crowd source knowledge of native tree species; I'm working on a website for this part of the project, and plan to launch it within a year.'

To make soil analysis easy for remote clients, Mr Sharma also hopes to develop a small, GPS-enabled soil probe that will test soil and upload the data onto their servers.

When the probe is integrated with our database, at the push of a button you'll know the soil constituents and what nutrients it needs, and we'll be able to immediately send a complete species list and a detailed procedure,' he said.
