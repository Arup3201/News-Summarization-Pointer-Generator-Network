A glamour model whose lingerie photographs were sold to porn and erotica companies to use online is suing her photographer.

Nicole Forni, a professional model from Cleveland, Ohio, claims that she only agreed to pose for the provocative pictures on the condition that they were not sold on for any 'adult-oriented' purposes.

But after the shoot she and her family found the images used on websites for sex guides in Germany and Spain, an escort website in Switzerland, as well as gracing the cover an erotic e-book entitled Horny Housewives of Dubai: Episode 4.

Legal documents presented to a Manhattan federal court this week also claim that a Pittsburgh strip club, a seduction guide publisher, the dating website Cougar911 and numerous websites selling webcam sex shows also used the pictures of Forni.

The model is demanding $75,000 from Joshua Resnick, who took the photographs, alongside the slew of sex-related companies who allegedly used them.

The legal document says Resnick approached her with an offer of taking the photographs, which she could use in her portfolio in lieu of being paid for them.

It then details how Forni travelled to Resnick's studio in Columbus, Ohio, where she lay down on a white bed and posed in a lacy black ensemble.

It says she was promised that no obscene use would be made of them before the shoot, and signed the model release afterwards.

But it fells how her family members soon broke the news to her that the photographs were doing the rounds of erotic websites, including Playboy, and were even being made into wallpaper.

Her lawyers claim that Resnick is guilty of fraud not breaking their agreement, which he did not incorporate into a written model release form, which she signed.

Michael O'Shea, the attorney representing Forni, said the pictures were meant to be a 'Victoria's Secret-style' shoot which would allow her to retain her 'dignity'.

O'Shea told the New York Post: 'She was mortified... there’s a certain level of dignity that people live with, and this guy violated that dignity and trust for a few bucks.'

In the lawsuit, originally filed in Ohio, Forni's attorneys said they want the sites and publishers who used the images to take them down. 

A lawyer for Resnick told the Post that the allegations against him are 'baseless'. 

Far and wide: This Brazilian sex site was also running the image of Forni, alongside others allegedly including Playboy maagzine. The suit even says a wallpaper offering her likeness as a design
