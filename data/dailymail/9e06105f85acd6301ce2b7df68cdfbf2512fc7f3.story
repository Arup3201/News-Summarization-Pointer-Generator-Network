This is the remarkable moment a man paralysed for 10 years walked with the help of a robotic skeleton. 

Gareth Herridge broke his neck and badly damaged vertebrae in a car crash on in January 2005.

He was left with no mobility below his chest and severely restricted arm movement. 

Now, however, a robotic skeleton has given him  the ability to walk.

Hope: Gareth Herridge, who has been paralysed for a decade since a car crash, walks using a robotic skeleton

To celebrate his 32nd birthday, Mr Herridge was able to try on equipment that could change his life for the better.

The Rex robotic skeleton is a suit that supports the body in an upright position, allowing the paralysed user to walk forward and backwards and shuffle from side to side without the aid of crutches.

The futuristic bionic 'exo-skeleton' is a prototype made by New Zealand-based company Rex Bionics.

The suit can be bought at a cost of £90,000 by individuals or from hospital trusts later this month, with the chance of users being able to have private sessions estimated at a price of £200.

The Rex robotic skeleton is a suit that supports the body in an upright position.

It allows the paralysed user to walk forward and backwards and shuffle from side to side without the aid of crutches.

Rex users move from their chair into Rex, strap themselves in and control their movements using a joystick and control pad.

The equipment weighs 38kg (84lb) and is individually made for each user.

It is powered by a lightweight, long-life rechargeable battery.

It is strapped tightly to the legs and around the waist uses joysticks to control the speed and direction of movement.

Because Mr Herridge is quadriplegic, he cannot use other devices that require upper body strength.

Speaking about the experience, he said: 'I'm always open to the possibility of new things, so I was happy to be the guinea pig.

'When you're sitting down all the time, it's a refreshing change to be on eye level with people.

'I was a bit unsure about how my legs would take it because I get spasms, but I was surprised how easy it was to use and the movement it gave 

'I've used standing frames before to be able to move - and this one felt really good.'

Challenge: Mr Herridge said he he was 'happy to be the guinea pig' and was always 'pen to the possibility of new things'.  'I've used standing frames before to be able to move - and this one felt really good'

It is hoped the exoskeleton could offer increased independence to wheelchair users, as well as helping people do jobs that are too restrictive in a wheelchair.

Crispin Simon, Chief Executive of Rex Bionics, said: 'While Rex will not offer the same functionality as before, for the right person, it can offer a big increase in their quality of life.

'It lifts them gradually from their wheelchair and when they stand it's emotional. 

'One man who had been unable to walk for 20 years brought all his friends when he used Rex for the first time.

'One of them who'd known him for years said he hadn't realised how tall he was.'
