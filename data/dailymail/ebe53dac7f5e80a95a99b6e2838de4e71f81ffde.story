Isaiah Brown missed an early penalty and had to wait until extra-time for redemption as his cool finish set holders Chelsea on their way to the last four of the FA Youth Cup.

The England Under-19 forward saw his weak spot-kick saved by man-of-the-match Freddie Woodman after just four minutes but, following an entertaining stalemate in normal time, he made no mistake when sprung clear to break the deadlock in front of 11,664 inside St James’ Park.

Brown – the second-youngest player in Premier League history having made his debut with West Brom aged 16 – is well thought of at Stamford Bridge and has already won promotion to Jose Mourinho’s first-team squad this season.

But the senior boss will not be impressed when he sees replays of the under-cooked penalty which should have set them on their way to a comfortable victory, such was their first-half dominance.

As it was the brave Magpies took the Blues to an additional 30 minutes and, after Brown’s opener, fellow frontmen Dominic Solanke and Tammy Abraham settled an absorbing tie.

Chelsea were all over their hosts during a frenetic opening and had their penalty when left-back Jay Dasilva burst into the penalty area before accepting the invitation of Michael Newberry’s outstretched leg and toppling to the turf.

It looked a soft award and justice was served when Woodman – shootout hero in the previous round at Sunderland – guessed right and dived low to his left to smother Brown’s tame effort.

The West Londoners were looking quicker and stronger than their hosts and Solanke headed wide from Fikayo Tomori’s delivery soon after – the England Under-18 should, on reflection, have tested Woodman.

Solanke must have thought he was about to open the scoring on 23 minutes when Abraham drew back towards his unmarked feet eight yards from goal. Newcastle anchorman Ben Drennan, however, had read the unfolding danger and slid in to steal and clear.

The dreadlocked Abraham – on the books since the age of eight - was proving chief tormentor and he fashioned half a yard for a shot on the edge of the area before dispatching towards the top corner. Woodman, though, is highly rated on Tyneside and it was easy to see why as he readjusted his feet to dive and fist clear.

Tammy Abraham was unlucky with this effort before hitting the target in extra-time

Within 60 seconds Abraham was taking aim once again, this time lashing over from 12 yards after spinning to connect with Solanke’s dinked delivery.

Chelsea had one final chance to break parity before the interval but again Woodman was equal to it, Charly Musonda’s dipping free-kick smuggled clear by the inspired gloveman.

Musonda - the Belgian midfielder formerly of Anderlecht – was catching the eye with his daring runs from the middle of the park and shortly after the restart he slalomed into United’s area only for his low poke to be flipped around the upright by Woodman.

The win meant holders Chelsea  reached their sixth successive FA Youth Cup semi-final

Newcastle had rarely ventured from their own half during the opening hour but, perhaps buoyed by the good fortune which kept the tie goalless, set after a breakthrough of their own.

Sean Longstaff dissected the visiting rearguard with a cute pass to free the front-running right-back Jamie Cobain and his rising drive was helped over the crossbar by the previously untroubled Bradley Collins.

Home striker Adam Armstrong – with nine senior appearances this term – then chopped one way and the other inside the penalty area to work room for a shot but his stab was repelled by the well-placed Collins.

With legs beginning to tire and the game becoming stretched there were chances to be had. Chelsea were next to threaten and Solanke – unguarded just six yards from goal – somehow headed wide when Kyle Scott landed a free-kick on his brow.

Brown then blazed over from 18 yards and Solanke, likewise, located the lower tier of the Leazes End when executing a spectacular bicycle kick in stoppage-time.

But after a goalless 90 minutes the Blues were in front within four of the restart, Brown sprung clear before rounding Woodman and coolly slotting home.

Solanke then got his goal with a cheeky dink over Woodman and Abraham settled the contest in injury-time with Solanke the provider.

It was belated, but deserved.
