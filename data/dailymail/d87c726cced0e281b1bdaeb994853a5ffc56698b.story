Prime Minister Tony Abbott has confirmed Parliament House in Canberra has been a target for terrorists and security will be beefed up.

Australian Federal Police officers will be deployed 'immediately' at the site of Australia's top government building in a bid to bolster security amid reports a terror attack was planned.

Speaking on Friday Mr Abbott said a review of security at Parliament House was conducted after the potential threats were identified. 

According to a senior intelligence source, it would not take much to gain access to the Prime Minister's office

It has been revealed Parliament House may have been a target in a possible terror attack

'One of the first consequences of the review of security has been moves to put Australian Federal Police back in charge of internal as well as external security,' he said.

'It is happening almost immediately.'

Mr Abbott's comments come following conversations which were intercepted by joint-intelligence agencies which intercepted 'chatter' that a terror attack was planned.

ASIO  intercepted  information about plans to target  the Prime Minister, other public officials and members of the public.

More than 5000 people work in Parliament House when Federal Parliament is in session  and it is a major attraction in for tourists  groups and schoolchildren.

Asked if people would be safe, Mr Abbott said: 'it is a safe country (Australia) but we have to be aware there are people ... who would do us harm.'  

Security will be bolstered at Parliament House for the first time since March when control was downgraded in March. 

Intelligence agencies uncovered a possible terror plot  similar to the one carried out in 2008 in Mumbai, India.

The Mumbai attacks  involved 12 separate incidents combining the use of guns and bombs over four days, and were orchestrated by terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba. 

Thursday's terror raids netted 15 arrests while two people  were charged

Suburbs across Sydney and Brisbane were targeted in the pre-dawn searches involving State and Federal police

Tony Abbott has revealed that more raids are likely in the wake of  new information about an attack on Parliament House 

The move to redeploy high-level security will be  bolstered over the coming days, in the wake of conversations reportedly intercepted by joint intelligence and security agencies.

'The chatter has picked up talk of Parliament House, I can confirm that' an intelligence officer told The Daily Telegraph.

It is understood the biggest concern was the threat to people inside that building, including not only staff but MPs and members of the general public who visit on a daily basis.

The 'chatter' was reportedly intercepted by joint authorities including police, counter-terrorism, spy, agencies, ­which revealed talk about access to Parliament House. 

In the wake of the raids it is understood airport level security checks for visitors and barriers are also being considered

From these raids, it was revealed suspected home-grown terrorists were plotting to pick a random person off the street and behead them

It also indicated ASIO was an additional target.

A senior intelligence source confirmed it would not be hard to gain access to Parliament House.

'There are a lot of lives in this building. And it is a building that is currently very vulnerable to a random act of violence,' the source told The Daily Telegraph.

'The weakest point is the ministerial wing. You could take out two blokes sitting at a desk and walk straight into the courtyard with a line of sight into the PM's office.'  

This possible plot has been revealed after Thursday's anti-terror raids that saw 800 police officers carry out 25 search warrants across Sydney's west and Brisbane.

Fifteen people were arrested but only two people were charged in Australia's largest operation of its kind.

From these raids, it was revealed suspected home-grown terrorists were plotting to pick a random person off the street and behead them while draped in an Islamic State flag on video, similar to the deaths of U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and British aid worker David Haines.
