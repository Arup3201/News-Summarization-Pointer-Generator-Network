A gang of thugs attacked an innocent girl, stamping on her face five times, simply because she was a Goth.

Melody McDermott, 22, was left with a fractured eye socket after the vicious attack which took place on a tram in Bury, Greater Manchester.

Manchester Police have released images of two of the men wanted over the violent attack, which has chilling echoes of the murder of student Sophie Lancaster, who was killed for being a Goth in 2008.

Wanted: Police want to speak to these two men in relation to the brutal attack

Police said the group started shouting abuse at Melody and a male friend before following them onto a tram at 6.40pm on October 5.

Melody was headbutted, pushed to the ground and her face was stamped on while her 29-year-old friend was left with a black eye after also being punched and kicked to the ground.

Melody was injured in a 'completely unprovoked and violent attack', said police

Sylvia Lancaster, whose Goth daughter Sophie was beaten to death ten miles away four years ago, condemned the attackers.

She told The Sun: 'Like her they were targeted for how they looked.'

A police spokesman told the MailOnline the attack on Melody and her friend was motivated by the victims' appearance.

Detective
 Constable Simon Swann from Bury CID said: 'This was a completely 
unprovoked and violent attack on two people who were returning home from
 an evening out. 

'They have been left with serious injuries that have left them both in a lot of pain.'

In 2008 the nation was appalled after Goth student Sophie Lancaster was  beaten to death by two teenagers.

Brendan
 Harris attacked Sophie, 20, when she begged him and four 
other drunken youths to stop beating her boyfriend, Robert Maltby.

Senseless: Sylvia Lancaster has been campaigning for greater awareness after the needless death of her daughter Sophie in 2008

Her boyfriend survived the beating but Sophie died in hospital two weeks later.

At the trial into her death the court heard Harris, 15 and accomplice Ryan Herbert, 16, were so violent in their attack that when paramedics arrived at the scene in Bacup they couldn't tell if Sophie was male or female.

Anyone with information should phone police on 0161 856 8163 or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
