Liverpool find themselves outside the top four and unlikely to qualify for the group stages of the Champions League after two games in four days at Anfield in which they have failed to score against Real Madrid and Hull City. 

Joe Bernstein assesses how Brendan Rodgers can fix the problems currently afflicting the club. 

MARIO BALOTELLI AS SUAREZ'S REPLACEMENT 

You can't say Liverpool weren't warned the Uruguayan would go one day. But by pebble-dashing their summer spending on a number of squad players instead of one A-lister, they've come up short.

With Daniel Sturridge injured, Mario Balotelli has been tried as the main source of goals, and failed. 

But it's not all the Italian's fault. Asking him to make Suarez-style runs in a free-flowing attack is like picking Usain Bolt for the Olympics and telling him to compete in the 5,000metres. 

Balotelli's strength is his strength, feeling the defenders up against him and physically turning them. Rodgers must either leave Balotelli out or change Liverpool's style until Sturridge returns. Even Fabio Borini would be a better bet.

SIMON MIGNOLET LEAVING THE DEFENCE STRESSED 

Simon Mignolet makes an excellent sweeper-keeper in terms of having great feet for a goalkeeper. It's the way many managers want to go in the modern game so that they play a high defensive line.

Unfortunately, Mignolet's deficiencies, not commanding his penalty area and questionable communication, have left the back-four jittery. 

Rodgers would be better off going back to basics and spending £10million on a traditional, strong goalkeeper like Asmir Begovic, even if he isn't as good a footballer as Mignolet.

STEVEN GERRARD A FADING FORCE

Gerrard can still dictate the tempo of the game when he's allowed to. But opponents aren't stupid, they will try to find a way of capitalising on his lack of mobility at the age of 34. 

If Gerrard is going to play in front of the back-four, he needs legs alongside him – and that means Jordan Henderson rather than Joe Allen or Lucas. 

With Henderson on the bench on Saturday, it was noticeable how much more energy Hull had in their midfield, particularly Mo Diame. 

It was only after Henderson came on that Gerrard burst into late life.

THE RAHEEM STERLING 'CRISIS' 

Raheem Sterling arrived back from the World Cup the great hope of English football. 

But for every great performance this season, and there have been some, there have also been patchy displays, an unwise link to Real Madrid while contract negotiations are underway and claims from England manager Roy Hodgson that the player had told him he was tired. 

At 19, Sterling is a good winger and a good No 10. But it's too much for him to switch from one to another with regularity. For this season, Rodgers should tell Sterling where he wants him to play – and stick to hit. He needs stability.

MIXED-UP STYLE 

Liverpool's pattern of play was uncomplicated last season, and thrilling. 

Suarez, Sturridge and Sterling tore defences apart, Henderson and Gerrard dictated the play, they scored more than the opposition. But Liverpool have lost a bit of their identity with the number of new signings made. 

The addition of the Champions League means certain new signings like Adam Lallana haven't been given a run of matches to adjust to life at Anfield. 

It's difficult because modern football requires some rotation but Rodgers should surely stick to his best XI for a few games at least to establish rhythm. Then he can make changes.
