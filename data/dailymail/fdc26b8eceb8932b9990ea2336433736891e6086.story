A suspected drink-driver lost control of his SUV and ploughed into a house, tearing through two bedrooms, a living room and a dining room before ending up in the backyard.

Owner Greg Buckland, 37, of Portland, was in one of the bedrooms and injured in the crash, but counts himself lucky to have survived.

The driver, 28-year-old James Kelly Anderson, fled from the scene, but was picked up by police minutes later and arrested for suspicion of driving under the influence of intoxicants, hit-and-run driving, reckless driving and criminal mischief.

Destroyed: A suspected drunk driver in an SUV smashed through five rooms of a home in Portland. 'It honestly looks like a bomb went off in there,' the owner said

Virtually everything in the house was wrecked

Police believe that Anderson was 
driving the SUV at around 100 mph when he crashed through the side wall 
of Buckland's home, careering through five rooms before finally coming 
to a stop in the backyard.

The property is a write-off and may longer be structurally stable. Buckland told Oregon Live that the house shifted three inches off its foundations.

Nearly
 all of his furniture, including three TVs and a fish tank, has been 
destroyed. 'It honestly looks like a bomb went off in there,' Buckland 
said.

The home owner 
was in the house when the incident happened and was taken to hospital 
for minor injuries. The vehicle hit his hip, shoulder and arm, throwing 
the man through a wall.

Buckland was already recovering from shoulder
 surgery that he had last week. ER doctors told him that the muscle had 
been retorn, so he'll have to endure the operation again.

But despite losing his house, Buckland is grateful for his life. 'It's a miracle I'm alive,' he told Koin Local. 'Six inches either way and he would be facing manslaughter charges.'

'If I would have been in the living room, I would have been dead,' he added to Oregon Live.

Buckland's pet cat was injured too but also survived the incident.

Once Anderson came to a delayed halt in the backyard of the house, the driver ran from the vehicle back through the house.

Here
 Buckland apprehended him, reports Oregon Live. 'I said "What in the 
world were you doing?"' Buckland remembered asking Anderson. 'He said, 
"Obviously, I just drove through your house."'

The
 homeowner tried to prevent Anderson leaving and the pair had a heated 
conversation. 'He got up in my face,' Buckland recalls.

Anderson then ran off, but police caught the man outside his own house, which is in the same neighborhood.

The house is a write-off and structurally unsound - the crash moved the property three inches off its foundations
