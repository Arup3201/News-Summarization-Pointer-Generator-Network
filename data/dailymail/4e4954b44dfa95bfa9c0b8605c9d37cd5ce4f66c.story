His face bruised and battered, a scuffed and swollen hand held out of harm's way, Olivier Martinez headed home from hospital on Thursday afternoon.

The French actor was injured during a 'brutal fight' with his fiance Halle Berry's ex lover Gabriel Aubry, which left both men hospitalised and saw Aubry charged with misdemanour battery.

The shocking brawl came as Aubry dropped off his daughter Nahla at Halle's house on Thanksgiving morning.

Olivier reportedly tried to speak to Aubry about the ongoing custody dispute between him and Halle.

After Olivier said to Gabriel 'We have to move on,' the Canadian model is said to have pushed the French actor and tried to punch him before a full blown fight broke out.

Gabriel and Halle - who split in 2010 - have been at odds ever since she tried to convince a judge to allow her to move to France with Nahla, a move which was recently blocked by the courts.

Onlookers told TMZ the fight was 
'brutal', with the website describing a blow-by-blow account of
the melee.

A source said: 'Olivier blocked [Gabriel's punch] and the punch 
struck him in the shoulder instead... Gabriel then pushed 
Olivier to the ground, a struggle ensued, ending when Olivier pinned 
Gabriel to the ground.'

Olivier performed a citizen's arrest on his love rival, before police were called to the scene and arrested Aubry for battery. He was charged upon his discharge from hospital and released after meeting the $20,000 bail.

Andrew Smith, Commanding Officer, LAPD Media Relations and Community 
Affairs Group, told People: He [Aubry] was booked for a private persons arrest 
for battery.'

Calm before the storm: Halle and Olivier headed out for lunch at Angelini Osteria in West Los Angeles prior to the fight on Wednesday

A judge then issued an emergency protective order - meaning Aubry has to stay 100 
yards away from Halle and Olivier, as well as his daughter Nahla.

Gabriel
was taken to hospital for his injuries after suffering a broken rib, 
bruises to the face and a possible more serious head injury, with there being conflicting reports as to whether he was left unconscious following the bloody brawl.

Olivier has a potentially broken hand and
neck injuries., and arrived at the same Los Angeles hospital for 
treatment as Gabriel around an hour after him.

It is unclear whether four-year-old 
Nahla witnessed the fight between her father and future stepfather.

However sources told TMZ that Halle rushed her daughter inside to prevent her seeing the dramatic fight.

However, the
youngster was later seen being carried in her mother's arms as the 
anxious looking actress arrived home with Olivier following his discharge from hospital.

After a brief stop at home, the pair headed to a friend's house nearby.

Martinez, who has apparently become
increasingly bitter during the custody battle, is said to be keen to 
press charges, TMZ reports.

A source told TMZ: 'Gabriel went nuts in front of Halle and other witnesses.'

However, details about the argument are unclear because both men were speaking in French.

Gabriel,
a French-Canadian model who lives and works in Los Angeles, had petitioned the
court to stop Halle's plans to move to France with Nahla.

He argued that the move would give him limited access to his 
young daughter.

However, the Cloud Atlas actress countered the privacy laws are 
stronger in France and would keep Nahla safe from the paparazzi.

She said at the time: 'Our issues were never about fighting for her. We both know a child needs both her parents. But what I want to say about it is sometimes, as a couple, you reach an impasse.

'We needed a court and a judge to help us work out some of the delicate issues, and I'm so happy we've arrived at that place – because for her sake, this is the best way. We both love her more than life.'

Halle, 46
- who split with Gabriel in 2010 - and Olivier, had put their wedding 
plans on hold while the actress focused on her custody battle.

Aubry filed legal papers in December 2010, seeking formal recognition as Nahla's father, as well as joint legal and physical custody.

At the time, a representative for the actress said: 'Halle has serious concerns for her daughter's well-being while in the care of her father for any extended period of time.'

But a spokesperson for the model soon responded: 'The fact is that Gabriel is a caring father who shares custody of Nahla.'

In happier times: Gabriel had spoken about his wish to give Nahla a brother or sister while he and Halle were together

Just 24 hours prior to the vicious spat, Halle, Oliver and Gabriel all attended an early Thanksgiving celebration in Los Angeles with Nahla.

While Halle and Olivier picked up Nahla from school and drove her to the party, her father took her home with him on Wednesday.

The Oscar-winning actress looked 
strained as she left the event carrying a feathered headpiece and jacket
belonging to her daughter.

In her custody battle, Halle claimed Los Angeles was not the ideal place for her daughter to grow up, 
due to the constant glare of the paparazzi.

She has insisted that it was not an attempt to keep Nahla's model father away from her.

The Monster's Ball actress made a rare comment about her custody battle with Gabriel to InStyle magazine this month.

'There is turbulence, but this too shall pass,' she said.

Halle
and Gabriel split in April 2010 after more than four years of dating, 
and she soon began a relationship with actor Olivier. They confirmed 
their engagement in March.

Halle has previously said being a mother to little Nahla has made her feel 'complete' as a person.

She
explained in an interview with Essence magazine: 'I'm complete. I have 
more to offer my craft because [my daughter] makes me indelibly better 
every day.'

Prior to their split, Gabriel had even spoken about giving their daughter a sibling.

He
told People: 'Nahla needs a sibling. I think it's important. I've never
known anybody who's had a single child [and] I've always been around 
big families. I believe in big families.'
