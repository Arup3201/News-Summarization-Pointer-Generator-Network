Two men who petrol bombed a mosque in revenge for the Drummer Lee Rigby killing have been jailed today. 

Self proclaimed fascist Clive Ceronne, a 37-year-old security guard who belonged to the English Defence League, was given four and a half years for the hate crime attack.

Ashley Juggins, 20, who was recruited by Ceronne into his extreme right-wing anti-Muslim world, received three and a half years.

Gloucester crown Court heard that on the night of June 17 this year - less than a month after the killing of Drummer Rigby in London - Ceronne and Juggins drove to the Masjid-E-Noor mosque in Ryecroft Street, Gloucester.

Evening prayer had finished and the mosque was locked up but the lights were still on.

Ceronne waited in his black Peugeot car outside the mosque at just before 12.50am while Juggins went up to the doorway, poured out a can of petrol and then set it alight with a burning envelope.

In CCTV shown to the court a fireball could be seen erupting from the doorway with flames apparently engulfing Juggins.

Wearing a white jacket with the hood pulled up Juggins then ran down the street to rejoin Ceronne and the pair drove away.

Peter Coombes, prosecuting, said the fire burned intensely for three minutes until a passing motorist stopped and used his fire extinguisher to put out the flames.

Neighbours who had ran from their houses opposite poured buckets of water over the fire but this had no effect.

Mr Coombes said the mystery motorist who prevented serious damage to the mosque has never been identified or traced by the police.

Judge Jamie Tabor QC said it was a great shame he had not been found to be thanked and rewarded for his public spirited actions.

The fire caused £3,200 damage to the mosque.

Jailing the men the judge told them 'Lee Rigby was killed 27 days prior to this offence and although it has not been openly declared by either of your advocates as a reason for this attack I do not regard it as a co-incidence that it should follow so soon after his death.

'Ninety-nine per cent of the population of this country, irrespective of their colour or creed, will have been horrified by the circumstances surrounding that tragic killing.

'After his death there were a series of arson attacks on mosques across the country - Grimsby, Harlow, Haywards Heath, Luton. Those attacks were termed hate crimes and I have no doubt this offence was driven by hate.'

'Such extremist views when they lead to activity of this kind destabilise the community, breed distress and very often destroy bridge building. This is precisely what extremists want'

Judge Jamie Tabor QC

Addressing Ceronne, the judge said 'I have no doubt that you have an enduring hatred for followers of Islam and you are quite unwilling or unable to differentiate between the tiny minority who have extremist views and the vast majority of law abiding citizens who, for instance, worship at the Gloucester mosque.

'In short, your views are or were equally extreme as the various persons you sought revenge against.

'Such extremist views when they lead to activity of this kind destabilise the community, breed distress and very often destroy bridge building. This is precisely what extremists want.

'In short, you played into their hands to provide propaganda to be used against the population at large.'

After Ceronne’s arrest soon after the fire his employers, P&L Security, told police he had ‘expressed anti-Muslim views’ to them.

In September 2009 Ceronne had a police caution for racially aggravated behaviour, Mr Coombes said.

Police carried out internet research on Ceronne and found his email address in the list of members of the British Union of Fascists dated Feburary 22 this year, the barrister added.

'Ceronne’s entry on the website said he had been involved in ‘a few far Right cults including the English Defence League,’ said Mr Coombes.

'He believes in freedom of speech although the defence recognises that this went way, way beyond what is acceptable'

Joe Maloney, defence 

A January 19 website entry by the New British Union described Ceronne as the district officer for Gloucestershire.

Police also found internet chat page dated September 2011 where Ceronne used racist anti-muslim terms.

Pieces of paper about the EDL were found in a bedroom at Ceronne’s home. One of them contained ‘a diatribe against Sharia Law.’ 

Another said ‘EDL Forever, No Surrender’ and was signed Clive.

There was also a printout referring to ‘EDL Angels who oppose Islamic extremists’ with information about an EDL rally in Bradford.

Ceronne, from Gloucester, and Juggins from Cheltenham, both pleaded guilty to arson being reckless whether life was endangered on June 18.

Joe Maloney, for Ceronne, said: 'He recognises that what he was involved in was totally unacceptable. He does not seek to suggest he can in any way justify what happened.'

Both men had been drinking that night and alcohol fuelled their actions, he said.

'He believes in freedom of speech although the defence recognises that this went way, way beyond what is acceptable. 

'Since he has been in custody he has had cause to reflect on some of his beliefs. That is not to say he has dramatically changed overnight. It would be foolish to suggest otherwise.'

For Juggins, Dermot Clarke said he had not wanted to cause real damage or danger and had spread the petrol around the doorstep rather than on the door.

Juggins had been recruited to the EDL by Ceronne at the library in Hesters Way, Cheltenham, when Ceronne worked as a security guard there, he said.

But Juggins had quit his EDL membership after a couple of years because he felt it was ‘nothing more than throwing things at the police.’
