Along with champions Manchester City and the nationwide-supported Manchester United, the DVD review of Sunderland’s season was one of the best sellers over the summer.

Why? There was, of course, the escape from relegation, manager Gus Poyet describing their four wins from the final five matches as a ‘miracle’. That run included memorable victories at Stamford Bridge and Old Trafford. 

It was also a campaign in which Sunderland completed the double over North-East rivals Newcastle for the first time since 1967.

Memories: Poyet says his side hope to recreate the cup run from last season which inspired league survival

But amid all of that was a first cup final appearance at Wembley in 22 years. More than 40,000 fans descended on the capital for the League Cup final with Manchester City. 

And, despite a 3-1 defeat, it is that weekend which defined their season and triggered the record DVD sales.

On Wednesday night, at Championship side Birmingham City, Sunderland begin another Capital One Cup adventure. And given the memory of that March afternoon at Wembley, Poyet will be paying this competition the utmost respect.

Strong start: Sunderland picked up a point against Manchester United, and won't make many changes

‘We will be trying to do it again (make the final),’ said the Uruguayan. ‘Normally it's one final every 20-plus years, so to do two in a row, you're asking a lot - but we will try.

‘It's incredible what people have been saying to me. They talk more about the game at Wembley that we lost, than the miracles we won. That's how much it means.’

Sunderland’s run to the final included victories over Premier League Southampton, Chelsea and Manchester United. But they also had to negotiate MK Dons and Peterborough United in the earlier rounds.

And Poyet – whose side drew 1-1 with Louis van Gaal’s United in the Premier League on Sunday – will not be making sweeping changes like most top-flight managers.

He went on: ‘Last year in the beginning we had some nice draws at home. I used one game against Southampton to try something different. 

'Then we beat Chelsea in extra-time and we were in the semi-finals. When you're there, you take your chances.

Game time: Jordi Gomez needs and deserves to play on Wednesday according to Sunderland boss Poyet

Likely to start: Billy Jones should also get a game against Birmingham after returning from injury

‘I can promise you there are not going to be too many changes. There will be a few – there are players that need to play. Jordi Gomez needs to play and deserves to play. 

'I need to play (Costel) Pantilimon as well because it's a big competition in there (the goalkeeping department). Billy Jones is back from injury and needs to play.

‘So there's going to be three or four (changes) but I'm not going to take it lightly, make 11 changes or change the system.

‘It's going to be tough, it's different, but that's the cup, it's a good thing. It's like individual finals. You need to win all the time to get through. It brings a good feeling to the team because it's a small celebration if you get through.

Promising start: Winger Will Buckley impressed on the weekend and could continue in midweek

‘I want to win, I don't want any draws. I want to get back to winning ways so we have that feeling so on Saturday we go into the game (against QPR) with a winning mentality.’

The commercial department at the Stadium of Light will be hoping Poyet is good to his word.
