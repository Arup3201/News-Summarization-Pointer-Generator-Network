'In love': Prison governor Florent Goncalves, 42, faces a three-year sentence if found guilty of presenting an inmate with love letters and gifts

A former prison governor has appeared in a French court accused of giving special treatment to a notorious femme fatale criminal he had 'fallen in love' with.

Florent Goncalves, 42, faces a three-year sentence for presenting the strikingly beautiful Emma Arbabzadeh, 23, with love letters and gifts.

He regularly had sex with her in prison, but is solely being charged with illicit correspondence, and giving an inmate presents.

Arbabzadeh became infamous in 2008 when she was found guilty of luring Ilan Halimi, a 23-year-old Jewish salesman, to his death at the hands of a gang of racist killers called 'The Barbarians'.

Arbabzadeh, who has since been released, has since featured in a book written by Goncalves, in which she is portrayed as a 'honey-trap' femme fatale who makes men 'lose their heads'.

When Arbabzadeh began a nine-year sentence at Versailles women's prison near Paris, Goncalves is said to have selected her for 'special treatment'.

But Goncalves's defence barrister, Pascal Garbarini, today told Versailles Correctional Court that his client had 'simply fallen in love and did not know how to control his passion'.

He added: 'If there had been no Barbarians gang, then this would never have got to court.

'The truth is, this is simply a love story - an unlikely one, but still a love story.'

Arbabzadeh is herself facing a charge of receiving stolen goods, but her barrister told the court that she had solely received two mobile phone chips.

Dominique Attias said: 'There are thousands of mobile phones in prisons. But these cases don't all land up in court.'

Mr Attias said the sensational Barbarians case had turned Arbabzadeh into a criminal celebrity.

When other prisoners learned that she was having regular sex in the prison computer room, and in Goncalves's office, they complained.

This led to a police investigation, after which Goncalves, who is married with children, was forced to resign.

He was able to rekindle his relationship with Arbabzadeh when she was released in 2010. She had been let out for good behaviour after having been on remand since 2006.

Goncalves then wrote a book in which he discussed the affair, saying 'I did not regret it for a moment', although he admitted that it had ruined his reputation as a happy family man and 'humanitarian' prison governor.

Goncalves, who had been France's youngest ever prison governor, said Iranian-born Arbabzadeh had genuinely been in love with him.

In a case which shocked France, Arbabzadeh was still a teenager when, in January 2006, she used her good looks to lure Mr Halimi to a flat on the outskirts of Paris.

There he was tortured for three weeks before he died. A total of 27 people were convicted for playing a part in the murder, with anti-Semitism and profiting from a failed ransom plot cited as the motive.

Goncalves denies the charges. The case continues.
