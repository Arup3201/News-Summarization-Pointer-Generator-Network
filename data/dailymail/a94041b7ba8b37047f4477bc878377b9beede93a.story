Taken: 14-year-old Ayvani Hope Perez was abducted from her suburban Atlanta home Tuesday by two men who broke in through a back door. She is 4-foot-9 and weighs 93 pounds with brown eyes and hair

A 14-year-old Ellenwood, Georgia girl is believed to be in extreme danger after she was abducted in the night Tuesday by two armed home invaders.

Two African American men broke into Perez's suburban Atlanta home around 2am and demanded money and jewelry from the family's mother.

The mother attempted to hide her children and the family dog, but the invaders discovered them and apparently took Ayvani after finding no valuables.

'She did not have any money and 
jewelry so they shot the dog and kidnapped the 14-year-old,' Clayton 
County police spokesman Phong Nguyen told the Atlanta 
Journal-Constitution.

The thieves pried open a back door in order to enter the home and were apparently total strangers to family.

'It didn’t appear that they knew each other,' he said. 'They just moved in about a month ago.'

The abductors escaped with Perez in a gray Dodge and were described as wearing dark clothing. No other details were available.
