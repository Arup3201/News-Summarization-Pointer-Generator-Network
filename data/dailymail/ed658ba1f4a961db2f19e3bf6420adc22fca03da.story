They released a video of gorgeous Angels advertising their new extensive swimwear range just a few days ago, but Victoria's Secret are back with one better already.

Candice Swanepoel stars in the sexy video modelling a gold bikini - and the campaign is accompanied by a very fitting slogan: 'Turn Up The Heat'.

The video is soundtracked to the sound of crashing waves and alternative electro tune 'Hearts' by Psychobuildings.

Hot stuff: Candice stars in the entire length of the gold bikini video

It sees Candice lie around in the sand and walk into and out of the sea, reminiscent of a Bond girl scene.

The lens zooms in on her curves, showing off her body and the bikini as she strikes sultry poses and waves crash over her.

The blonde beauty flirts with the camera from beneath her eyelashes and from behind palm leaves as she showcases 'The Very Sexy Baudeau' gold bikini to perfection.

With this performance Candice could 
easily join the ranks of Ursula Andress in her sexy beach scene from Dr No or
 Halle Berry's from Die Another Day.

Candice
 is currently holidaying in Brazil - and the South African beauty is 
making sure she fits in with the local bikini-clad girls.

The
 25-year-old Victoria's Secret model slipped into her new Brazilian 
bikini and shared a snap with her Twitter fans on Thursday.

The scene changes from beach to jungle but the bikini still looks just as good

The very revealing two-piece features tiny bottoms that accentuate Candice's pert derriere and a white 
top with knotted detailing at the back.

The new swimsuit was a gift from a Los Angeles-based swimwear line and Candice couldn't have been more thrilled.

'Thank you @frankiesbikinis for the Gift! i Love the tribal patterns #bikinioftheday #brasil,' she wrote.

While Frankie Bikinis is a label from 
Malibu, California, it seems they have captured the essence of the 
'Brazilian bikini' in their swimsuit collection.

An avid Twitter and Instagram fan, Candice had taken the snap in the comfort of her own bedroom.

The
blonde beauty recently purchased a home in Brazil, which is also the 
home country of her boyfriend of six years, Hermann Nicoli.

The
supermodel has been holidaying there since she was 17 years-old,
and while it is the perfect place for relaxation she says she and her 
beau keep active during their getaways.
