Dried tomato skins left over from the making of Heinz ketchup are to be used inside Ford cars as a plant-based alternative to plastic.

The tinned-food giant known for its '57 varieties' is looking at how it could use its bio-waste to create a 'green' replacement for petroleum-based plastic inside the cars such as the Mondeo, Fiesta, Focus and Galaxy.

Ford scientists are testing the durability of tomato fibre – made largely from waste peeled tomato skins, stems and seeds – for potential use in making wiring brackets and storage bins.

Innovative: The dried remains of tomatoes from Heinz tomato ketchup factories will be used to develop compartments for the inside of Ford cars in a bid to cut down on petroleum-based materials

The firms say it will reduce the use of 
petrochemicals used in the manufacture of plastic and so reduce the 
harmful impact on the environment.

Ford plastics research specialist Ellen Lee said: ‘Dried tomato skins could become the wiring brackets in a Ford vehicle or the storage bin a customer uses to hold coins and other small objects.

‘We are exploring whether this food processing by-product makes sense for an automotive application.

Project: How Ford and Heinz intend to work together

‘Our goal is to develop a strong, lightweight material that meets our vehicle requirements, while at the same time reducing our overall environmental impact.’

It is part of a project begun nearly two years ago when Ford began collaborating with Heinz, Coca-Cola, sports clothing firm Nike, and Procter & Gamble.

The scheme is a bid to accelerate development of a ‘plant-based plastic’ to help reduce use of petroleum-based materials currently in use.

Heinz’s research and development associate director Vidhu Nagpal said: ‘Our researchers were looking for innovative ways to recycle peels, stems and seeds from the more than two million tons of tomatoes the company uses annually to produce its best-selling product, Heinz Ketchup.

‘We are delighted that the technology has been validated.

'Although we are in the very early stages of research, and many questions remain, we are excited about the possibilities this could produce for both Heinz and Ford and the advancement of sustainable 100 per cent plant-based plastics.’

Ford said its commitment to ‘reduce, reuse and recycle’ is part of the company’s global ‘green’ strategy to lessen its environmental footprint while accelerating development of fuel-efficient vehicle technology worldwide.

A Ford spokesman said: ‘Ford has increased its use of recycled non-metal and bio-based materials.

'Rice is used to make electrical cowl brackets introduced in the last year, Ford’s bio-based portfolio now includes eight materials in production.

'Other examples include coconut-based composite materials, recycled cotton for carpeting and seat fabrics, plus soy foam seat cushions and head restraints.'

Ford employs 183,000 employees at 65 plants worldwide, including Britain.
