The dust coughed up by stars during their death throes has always been a mystery to scientists.

But trying to analyse the behaviour of this interstellar material involves going into deep space - and up until now that has hindered efforts to understand it.

Now researchers at Nasa have found a way around this problem by designing a machine that can create interstellar dust from scratch here on Earth.

A close up image of interstellar dust created by the Cosmic machine. This grain is approximately 1.5 micrometers in diameter. For comparison, a bacteria cell is around 5 micrometers

The device, dubbed Cosmic, could help astronomers better understand the types of grains that form around stars.

Dust grains that form around dying stars and are thrown out into the cosmos can lead to the formation of planets.

‘The harsh conditions of space are extremely difficult to reproduce in the laboratory, and have long hindered efforts to interpret and analyse observations from space,’ said project leader Farid Salama.

‘Using the Cosmic simulator we can now discover clues to questions about the composition and the evolution of the universe.’

The team started with small 
hydrocarbon molecules that they expanded in the cold jet spray in Cosmic
 and exposed to high energy in an electric discharge.

Nasa
 then detected and characterised the large molecules that are formed in 
the gas phase from these precursor molecules with highly sensitive 
detectors.

Cosmic  then collected the individual solid grains formed from these complex molecules and imaged them with a microscope.

In the past, the inability to simulate space conditions in the gaseous state prevented scientists from identifying unknown matter.

The Cosmic Simulation Chamber (Cosmic) could change this by recreating the extreme conditions that reign in space where interstellar molecules and ions float in a vacuum.

The densities found in space are billionths of Earth's atmosphere and average temperatures can be less than -167ºC (-270ºF)

‘We now can for the first time truly recreate and visualise in the laboratory the formation of carbon grains in the envelope of stars and learn about the formation, structure and size distribution of stellar dust grains,’ said Cesar Contreras of the Bay Area Environmental Research Institute.

‘This type of new research truly pushes the frontiers of science toward new horizons.’

‘During Cosmic experiments, we are able to form and detect nanoparticles on the order of 10 nm size, grains ranging from 100-500 nanometers and aggregates of grains up to 1.5 micrometres in diameter, about a tenth the width of a human hair,,’ said Ella Sciamma-O'Brien, of the BAER Institute and a research fellow at Nasa.

These results have important implications and ramifications not only for interstellar astrophysics, but also for planetary science.

For example, they can provide new clues on the type of grains present in the dust around stars. That in turn, will help us understand the formation of planets, including Earth-like planets.
