A former Big Brother contestant and glamour model burst into tears today after she was banned from driving and fined £250 for being drunk at the wheel.

Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace was on her way home from a West End fundraiser for 'Save Your Skin' cancer when she was stopped in her black Range Rover  on Edgware Road, west London, in June.

The 35-year-old, who shot to fame in 2006 after coming third in the reality TV series, was almost twice the legal limit and was subsequently arrested.

Guilty: Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace, 35, pictured left leaving Hammersmith Magistrates' Court, admitted drink-driving after she was stopped on the way home from a West End party (picture is not her driving at the time)

The model claimed she was forced to take the wheel after paparazzi mobbed after the pool party at the Haymarket Hotel, which was hosted by fake tan company Fake Bake.

Prosecutor Rav Chodha told Hammersmith Magistrates' Court she was in a collision with a Mercedes and left without exchanging her details. 

He added: 'Members of the public who were present had attempted to try to speak to the driver of that vehicle.

‘The vehicle was picked up by automatic number plate recognition cameras on the Edgware Road.'

When she was interviewed, Horgan-Wallace confessed she had consumed a large glass of white wine at the party.

She denied failing to stop at the scene of an accident and the Crown Prosecution Service dropped the charge.

Defence lawyer Maya Lal told the court Horgan-Wallace is a ‘business woman with a portfolio of properties in north London’ and is soon to embark on a career as a comedy actress.

She said the glamour model found herself surrounded by paparrazi when she left the hotel and was forced to take the wheel of the car after her friend kept stalling.

‘The defendant was driving from her home address with her friends, she was on her way to a charity event for Fake Bake,’ she said.

‘She had driven to this event and she had no intention of drinking as this was a business event.

‘Towards the end of the evening she had one large glass of white wine and she hadn’t eaten since the morning.’

She added: ‘The journey had been made difficult by all the press and paparazzi surrounding the vehicle and Danielle [Horgan-Wallace’s friend] stalled the vehicle.’

Magistrates heard Horgan-Wallace’s friend suffers from Crohn’s disease and had started to panic and stall the car.

‘She couldn’t get the car out from where it had been parked and that is when the defendant decided to drive as she believed she wasn’t over the limit,’ said Ms Lal.

She added Horgan-Wallace ‘stopped immediately’ when asked by the police.

Ms Lal added: ‘She would just like to say to the court that she is profusely apologises for her behaviour.'

Horgan-Wallace admitted drink driving, was fined £275, with £85 costs, ordered to pay a £27 victim surcharge and was disqualified for 17 months.

She was initially fined £1,500, but magistrates reevaluated her earnings and the amount was reduced.

The court heard that she earns £10,000 a year, which is supplemented by £700 a time interviews, which pay her another £4,-5,000 a year.

She told magistrates as they tried to asses the fine: 'Tomorrow I have an interview and I'll get seven hundred pounds for that. It comes to probably an extra four or five grand a year.' 

Raised as a Jehovah's Witness in north London, Horgan-Wallace is also the patron of several charities and the court was told she is the 'face of' National No Smoking Day. 

Dressed in a tight black dress, black patent heels and a navy fitted blazer, the model burst into tears as Magistrate Bagheri Mohammad read the sentence.
