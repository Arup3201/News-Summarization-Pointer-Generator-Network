Call the Doctor! A new smartphone app checks moles for signs of melanoma

Most people with moles know they should check them regularly for signs of skin cancer, but how many of us actually know what we're looking for?

At the tap of a screen, a new smartphone app can help identify if a little blemish might turn into a big problem.

'Doctor Mole' uses augmented reality technology to check moles for irregularities in size, shape, colour and border.

After taking a picture of a mole, the user is presented with a colour-coded 'risk' level for each of these characteristics.

The app can archive and compare data to check for any changes in a mole. It will also remind the user when it's time to check a mole again.

Changes in moles are a common sign of malignant melanoma, one of the three main types of skin cancer. Melanoma can also develop in normal-looking skin.

Although less common than basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, malignant melanoma causes the majority of deaths from skin cancer. It is mainly caused by exposure to UV rays.

Mark Shippen, the developer of Doctor Mole, lives in Australia, which has one of the highest skin cancer rates in the world.

Having lived in South Africa for 26 years before moving to Australia, he's experienced the danger of having fair skin in a hot climate.

Mark told MailOnline: 'I have already had 3 basal cell carcinomas removed from my neck, face and back, and at my age this is very rare. So I have pretty much seen first hand the dangers of the sun. That's where the idea for Doctor Mole came from.

'I don't have a background in medicine, but when I found my first cancer a few years back I pretty much read everything about it and had a solid understanding of what to look for. Then it was just a simple case of combining the knowledge I had gained with my software development skills, and DoctorMole was created.'

It's not just their beach culture that makes melanoma the most common cancer among Australians aged 15-44; the hole in the UV-blocking ozone layer above the Tasman Sea makes sun exposure down under especially dangerous.

In the UK, more than 10,600 people are diagnosed with melanoma each year. It is more common in women, who are most likely to develop it on the legs. In men, the danger areas are the chest and back.

More than 2 million Americans are diagnosed with skin cancer each year, and some 50,000 will be diagnosed with melanoma.

Melanoma is especially dangerous if it is not found early. Regular skin checks can help people discover melanoma in its earliest stages, doctors agree.

Mark hopes his app will help teach users how to check themselves, rather than just doing it for them.

'I could have just written an app that snaps a photo and spits out an answer, but I chose to make it as transparent as possible and try educate the user. So by doing it using the real time computer vision, the user can see immediately what sorts of things the app is monitoring... It makes it fun for the user and I think a lot easier to teach the user what sorts of things to look for.'

Doctor Mole isn't the first tool to help smartphone users check for signs of skin cancer. Other apps guide users through self exams, and the German-made 'Handyscope' converts an iPhone into a dermatoscope, which doctors use to look for melanoma.

But at £995, the Handyscope is in a different league to Doctor Mole, available from Apple's appstore for £2.49.

Mark stresses that his app is not, and will never be a substitute for a real doctor, even though he says quite a few doctors have told him they are using it with their patients.

'There are a lot of factors that can influence the image processing, such as shadows, poor lighting and poor camera quality, so I don't think any app could claim that they can spot a cancer 100%.
