If you're of the opinion that text speak and emojis are making us lazy and ruining language, you may want to look away now. 

A developer has created the ultimate predictive text app called Lazyboard that provides a list of just ten commonly used words, and 11 emoticons. 

Users can combine these prepopulated words to create messages quickly and simply without having to type a single letter. 

Lazyboard was created by Reddit user Sir-Zeph and it lets people communicate using a list of just ten commonly used words (pictured) including 'cool', 'nice', 'damn', 'oh', 'thks' 'lol' and 'lel'

The free app is available for phones running Android 4.2 and above, and words include 'cool', 'nice', 'damn', 'oh', 'thks' 'lol' and 'lel'.

Lazyboard was uploaded to the Google Play Store by developer Prem Adithya, listed as Reddit user Sir-Zeph.

Its description says: 'Feeling lazy? Not in the mood for a proper conversation? Well the only thing you need is the lazyboard.

'It is a minimalistic keyboard that has the important keys required to have a lazy conversation.'

The Lazyboard comes with two themes - dark and light - that can be configured in the app Settings menu, and Sir-Zeph wrote on Reddit that a pro version is 'coming soon' that will have more themes.

It is the latest in a long line of apps and products designed to tap into the growing trend of people replacing conversations with acronyms, emojis and shortcuts.

Last month, for example, developers  created a keyboard cover that turns every key of a Mac board into an emoji.

Once installed, the Caps Lock key lets users switch between regular and emoji keys meaning people can easily add images to Facebook posts, tweets and even official documents.

The Emoji Keyboard and its custom software were developed by a team of designers at California-based Disk Cactus.

Each of the covers are made of silicone and act like standard covers to block out dust and dirt. They come in two sizes - one for standard Macs, which includes the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro, the MacBook Air 13 and the Apple Wireless Mac keyboard (pictured), and one for the 11-inch MacBook Air

The team has set up a Kickstarter campaign to fund production of at least 1,000 covers, but hopes to be able to mass produce them by the end of the year.  

And last year a pair of London-based developers created the Emojli app that only let users communicate using the popular miniature images. 

Even usernames have to be comprised of a selection of emoticons.

And with the release of iOS 8 Apple allowed app developers to create emoji-based keyboards for iPhones, iPads and iPhones. 

A study in April last year found that the top trending word, at that time, was emoji. There are now apps dedicated  to the small images. Emojli, for example, (pictured) only lets users communicate using the popular pictures, and even usernames have to be comprised of a selection of emoticons

Emoji were originally popular in Japan, and widely used online.

However, in recent years they have become hugely popular elsewhere.

Originally meaning pictograph, the word emoji literally means 'picture'
 (e) + 'letter' (moji).

Icons
 are standardised and include some specific to Japanese culture, such as
 a bowing (apologising) businessman, a face wearing a face mask, a white
 flower used to denote 'brilliant homework' or a group of emoji 
representing popular foods: ramen noodles, dango, onigiri, Japanese 
curry, and sushi.

Some 
emoji character sets have been incorporated into Unicode, allowing them 
to be used elsewhere including websites and apps such as Facebook and Twitter.
