Two terraced houses have partially collapsed after scrap metal thieves broke into them and stole their cast iron window frames.

Emergency services sealed off the properties after neighbours reported hearing 'rumbling noises' and found rubble and debris on the pavement.

Witnesses suggested that the stolen metal would only have been worth about £20, but the damage to the buildings in Burnley, Lancashire, is much more costly.

Damaged: Debris and rubble lie on the pavement outside two homes in Burnley, Lancashire, which were targeted by scrap metal thieves

As well as taking out the window frames, which had been installed so the properties could be boarded up, the thieves removed stonework, making the buildings structurally unsafe.

The thefts were today being investigated by Lancashire Police.

Neighbour Danny Howarth, 25, said the area was often targeted by thieves hoping to steal copper and lead.

Describing the moment the window frames were taken, he added: 'I heard a bang and saw someone run out of the window and then the house started collapsing.

'The fire engines and police came and cordoned it all off. I think they must have been getting the copper and pipes, the fireplace is still inside though.

'They were meant to be knocking all this area down but we’ve not heard anything since.

'It used to be a really nice area when my grandparents moved her thirty years ago. Now it’s just a hell hole.'

James Burns, 73, who lives near the damaged houses, said the thieves struck at about 9pm on Monday.

'I was just sat in the living room and I saw flashing lights and so I went outside and saw two fire engines and a police car, he said. 'I went down and saw all the debris.

'They were going for the cast iron windows. They must have got in through the inside and were trying to knock it out.

'It would have been a hefty job - even though the house was in a bad state anyway.

'It’s the metal thieves who are dragging this place down.'

Builder James Slattery, 45, said: 'A lot of these houses are just boarded up now and it’s leading to criminal damage.

'The thieves would have been lucky to get only got £20 for that scrap iron, it’s not worth it. In fact they’d be lucky to get that.

'Scrap is good money overall but it is the damage afterwards which people are left with.'

Another neighbour, Wendy Jones, 48, said: 'There has been a lot of people roaming around and I’ve seen them stealing concrete slabs.

'These houses want knocking down before the scrap thieves pull it down themselves.'

Firefighter Neil Ashworth said three fire crews attended the incident, and warned that such crimes 'drained' the emergency services' valuable resources.

'The fronts of the houses started to collapse due to thieves taking out the cast iron window sets,' he said. 'They had completely removed one and one was left hanging out.'

He added: 'This was a major drain on resources with three appliances attending.

'We are used to attending unoccupied homes that have been targeted by thieves but this was a new level for us.

'They have endangered their own lives and the lives of others.

'It is ridiculous they are prepared to risk so much for what seems so little.'

Burnley Council said it was trying to contact the owners of the properties.

The authority's leader, Julie Cooper, said: 'It is amazing the lengths people will go to steal items like this.

'It is a growing issue and one that has been on my radar for a while.

'When the Shadow Home Secretary visited in April we went to some Calico properties that had pipes, radiators, and everything ripped out for metal thefts.

'It is growing on a grand scale, and I think it will continue to do so until we have some proper controls over scrap dealers.

'If they couldn’t take cash payments then there wouldn’t be as big a market for this kind of thing.'
