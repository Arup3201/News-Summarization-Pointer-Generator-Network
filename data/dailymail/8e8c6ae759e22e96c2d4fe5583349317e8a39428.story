Russia today dispatched six warships to its naval base in Syria in a move that is likely to spark concern in the West.

A flotilla led by an anti-submarine destroyer have sailed from the Arctic port of Severomorsk to Tartus.

However, military sources claim the deployment is nothing to do with the growing tensions in the country where the crackdown by 
government troops against opposition forces has intensified in recent 
weeks.

It comes as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has
proposed ending Syria's conflict 'step by step', starting with districts
 that have seen the worst violence, UN secretary general Kofi Annan 
told a news conference in Tehran today.

'He made a suggestion of building an 
approach from the ground up in some of the districts where we have 
extreme violence - to try and contain the violence in those districts 
and, step by step, build up and end the violence across the country,' Annan said.

He declined to give details, saying the plan needed to be discussed with the Syrian opposition.

The Admiral Chabanenko and three landing

Yaroslav Mudry and an assistance vessel.

Hope: UN secretary general Kofi Annan said Syrian president al-Assad had proposed ending the conflict 'step-by-step

'The programme of the voyage includes a call in the Syrian port of Tartus,' a military source told Interfax news agency.

He claimed the deployment 'was not linked to the escalation of the situation in Syria.'

The West may not see it the same way, having strongly criticised Russia for refusing to cut its military and political ties to Damascus despite the bloodshed in the country.

'In Tartus the ships will top up on supplies of fuel, water and foodstuffs,' said the source.

The flotilla is deploying in the Mediterranean, it was claimed.

The naval deployment can only buttress Russia's diplomatic muscle. Moscow is adamant that Syria should resolve its own problems without outside interference.

Last month, Britain forced a cargo vessel loaded with Soviet-era helicopter gunships and possible missiles to return to Russia by withdrawing its London-based insurance which contravened an EU embargo on military supplies to Syria.

Meanwhile, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 17,129 people have been killed 
in the country's 16-month-old revolt so far.

Around 884 defectors have been killed in 
the crackdown on the protest movement that began in spring 2011 and has 
since turned into an armed rebellion.

The total death toll included members of the security forces still loyal to Assad, of whom 4,348 have died.

Cyprus has also drawn up plans to take in up 
to 200,000 refugees from the fighting.

While the figures are a worst-case 
scenario, the number is equivalent to a quarter of the population of the
 Republic of Cyprus, a huge burden at a time of economic upheaval.

If such a crisis does erupt, officials are hoping the European Union will step in to help.

In
 2006, during a month-long war between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, 
about 90,000 people fled to Cyprus by boat and on evacuation flights. 
Britain and the United States helped out, as many of those fleeing were 
foreign nationals.
