A retired FBI forensic artist has claimed that a long-time suspect in the murder of Etan Patz carried around a picture of the missing child as a teenager.

Etan disappeared as he walked to a bus stop in New York City when he was six years old. Authorities believe he was abducted off
the street in SoHo in 1979 and later murdered.

Gene O'Donnell, who worked for the FBI for 32 years, believes that Jose Ramos, a child-molesting drifter who has long been suspected of killing Patz, had a picture of Etan when he was a teenager.

The artist is basing his claim on an age-progression sketch he did of Patz as a teenager which is eerily close to another picture of a teenage boy, seen wearing a T-shirt and jeans on a bus.

Resemblance: a photo of a teenaged boy looks very similar to an age-progression sketch of Etan Patz, who disappeared when he was just 6

'In 1990, I believed Etan Patz was the young man in the photograph on 
the bus. I have not changed my mind,' Mr O'Donnell told the New York Post.

'The fact that Ramos had the photograph in his pocket
is the thing that kind of threw me over the edge.'

However, police sources told the Post that they are certain the young man in the photograph is not Etan Patz after they tracked him down, held interviews and even completed a DNA test.

The case gets even more complicated after another man, Pedro Hernandez, confessed last year to strangling Patz in the basement of a SoHo bodega in 1979.

A photograph of Patz as a teenager would reveal his confessions to be false.

In 1990, Mr O'Donnell was asked by the NYPD to create a picture of Etan Patz showing the missing boy as a teenager. The forensic artist worked painstakingly to recreate an image from family photos.

Later he was shown a Polaroid that had been taken by police from Ramos' pocket.

He told MailOnline he is extremely interested to see any photographs taken of the teenager found by police, while they were holding interviews and tests.

'All I ever wanted to see was a photograph. If they got the right guy, he should match that boy on the bus,' Mr O'Donnell said. 'But I've never seen it.'

It's not clear whether any pictures of the teenager detectives tracked down were ever released to the public. Mr O'Donnell, who is writing a book about his part in the Patz case, said he was never contacted again regarding the missing boy after he submitted his age progression drawing.

Ramos' connection to Patz is through one of the boy's babysitters, who was friends with Ramos.

Shortly after Patz's disappearance, Ramos was convicted of multiple counts
of child molestation and served a 27-year prison sentence in 
Pennsylvania.

At the time of his arrest, authorities found dozens of photos in the drainpipe where Ramos had been living of young boys who all had a strong resemblance to Patz.

While incarcerated, a jailhouse snitch told authorities 
that Ramos had confessed to him that he knew what happened to Patz. 
However, it wasn't enough evidence for prosecutors to pursue charges.

Despite
no criminal charges, the Patz family sued Ramos in civil court, where 
he was found to have been responsible for the boy's death. The Patz family 
was awarded a ceremonial $2million, which they never attempted to 
collect.

Confusion: Pedro Hernandez claims he killed Patz, but there is no evidence linking him to the crime

Ramos, 70, is currently in a Pennsylvania prison for failing to register as a sex offender after serving a 27-year prison sentence.

The child molester has repeatedly denied involvement in Patz's disappearance.

Patz's father Stanley told the Post that he was shown the photo but doesn't believe it is his son.

Hernandez, who was arrested in May, 2012 - after Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance re-opened the Patz case - when family members told authorities that he admitted to killing Patz.

At the time of Patz's disappearance, Hernandez worked in a bodega just blocks from the boy's home.

Prosecutors may be forced to throw out the case against Hernandez - who is both schizophrenic and suffering from bipolar disorder - due to a lack of evidence.

Etan Patz was last seen in 1979 when he walked alone to the bus stop in Manhattan for the first time

A man confessed last year to kidnapping Patz and murdering him in the basement of a bodega just blocks from the boy's house

Many suspect the man's confession is bogus and is just the product of his mental illness
