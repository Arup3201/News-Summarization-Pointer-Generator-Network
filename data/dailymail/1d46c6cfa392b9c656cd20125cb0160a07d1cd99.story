Fox News head Roger Ailes has spoken out about how he wants to launch an entirely new channel dedicated to teaching 'the kids' history with the help of his star anchor Bill O'Reilly while keeping the changes at Fox to a minimum.

He also said that he has no concerns about Fox News staying at the top spot in cable news since his main competitors- saying that MSNBC 'dodged a bullet' by firing Alec Baldwin and slamming CNN as effectively 'throwing in the towel' by adding more documentaries to their programing line up.

'There are some good, smart people at those networks, and even occasionally a blind pig finds an acorn,' he told The Hollywood Reporter of CNN and MSNBC.

What's next: Roger Ailes (left) has revealed that he wants to launch a history-focused channel with Bill O'Reilly (right) since the Fox News anchor dedicates so much of his time to writing historical books

The notoriously private Ailes gave a rare interview just as news about an explosive new tell-all about his paranoid working style and bizarre personal behavior.

The news chief refused to co-operate with
 the book and said: 'Bette Davis said, I think it was Bette Davis, "What
 other people think of me is none of my business,"’ he told the 
magazine.

Bill O'Reilly: 'I think Bill can last as long as he wants because he's driven by organic energy. He likes money, but he's not doing it for the money. He probably likes power, but he's not doing it for the power.'

Sarah Palin: 'She's recognizable, she's attractive, and she still has the message of stop raising taxes.... I'm not a defender of everything she says. I don't hear everything she says. But I know she represents a certain group of people who rose up against their own party, which you rarely see. I probably hired her back, if you really want to get to the bottom of it, to give her a chance to say her piece and piss off the people that wanted her dead.'

Megyn Kelly: 'If they have to beat up somebody as talented as Megyn Kelly on Santa Claus, they're pathetic.'

Elisabeth Hasselbeck:  'She was in a tough spot on The View. She always came to play and always had a smile on her face, and that's critical in morning television. I knew she would work well here. It was a matter of just convincing her to come over.'

Maria Bartiromo, a new Fox Business hire from CNBC: 'She's a star.'

Rupert Murdoch: 'He calls once every day or two usually just to gossip and catch up on the news.'

Alec Baldwin: '(MSNBC) dodged a bullet. They put him in there, and they would've had to fire him for no ratings. He gave them a reason to get fired.'

Rachel Maddow: 'On a personal level, I like her. I don't want to hurt her career, so I won't say we get along, but I've had dialogue with her, and she's very smart.'

'Attacking me and Fox News is nothing new – it’s a cottage industry. What’s new is that Random House refused to fact check the content with me or Fox News- that tells you everything you need to know about this book and its agenda.'

Ailes, 73, is proud of the conservative network and said that he sees it expanding to appeal to their audience.

He cited the fact that they bumped anchor Megyn Kelly to the primetime line up from her afternoon spot in an effort to appeal to younger viewers.

The work that O'Reilly does outside of his show- namely writing books and promoting specials with a historical edge- as a possible new venue for growth, but pointedly saying that there were no plans for O'Reilly to leave the Fox line-up anytime soon.

'He likes money, but he's not doing it for the money. He probably likes power, but he's not doing it for the power. He's driven by things that he sees that are not right from his point of view,' Ailes said of O'Reilly in The Hollywood Reporter interview.  'I would like News Corp to form a history channel and let Bill work with me. I'd run it for him because I'd like history done correctly for a change. They're not teaching the kids the real stuff.'

One of his most controversial recent hires- or more accurately, 
re-hires- was former Alaskan governor Sarah Palin. He said that while he
 doesn't necessarily agree with everything she says- let alone does he 
always hear all of her statements- he decided to re-up.

That 
was reason enough for Mrs Palin, as she posted a recent photo of herself
 during a visit to the Fox and Friends set just hours after Ailes' 
interview went live. 

'Fox’s Roger Ailes says he hired me “to piss
 off the people that wanted her dead.” Hmmm. Funny. I accepted for the 
same reason!' she wrote as the caption.

He- expectantly- painted a very rosy picture of life inside NewsCorp, saying how he has a very comfortable relationship with owner Rupert Murdoch.

'He wanders in and ruins my schedule and just wants to talk. He calls once every day or two usually just to gossip and catch up on the news.... I think that's the way it is with Rupert. If you deliver money, you do fine,' Ailes said.

When the conversation turned to other 
channels, he said that Fox's longstanding hold on the highest ratings in
 cable news was not threatened because even though CNN won viewers with a
 recent film about SeaWorld's killer whales, that is not a sustainable 
method for a news channel.

Close: Ailes says that Rupert Murdoch (seen together in 1996) regularly calls in for a chat but leaves him to run Fox News largely on his own since the channel is doing so well

Taking the compliment: Sarah Palin posted this photo to her Facebook account from a recent trip to Fox and Friends and she said that she accepted the job for the same reason that he offered it- to spite her critics

'That means Fox has won the cable news wars. (CNN head Jeff Zucker) had a big hit with a whale one night (the documentary Blackfish). I guess he's going to do whales a lot. If I were Discovery, I'd be worried,' Ailes said.

He didn't mention any CNN hosts by name in his critique, but had nothing but kind words for MSNBC's Rachel Maddow who he likes 'on a personal level'.

The channel's decision to fire Alec Baldwin- who regularly makes barbs about Fox’s conservative broadcasting- after he was taped- once again- making homophobic comments, Ailes said that his competitors made the right move.

'They put him in there, and they would've had to fire him for no ratings. He gave them a reason to get fired,' he said.

Ailes' defensive interview comes ahead of the release of a scathing unauthorized biography stacked with outrageous stories about his time at Fox News.

Claims have been made in the tell-all called The Loudest Voice In The Room by Gabriel Sherman, a contributing editor at New York magazine who has charted the 73-year-old's life from his childhood in Ohio to one of the most powerful positions in television.

Sherman alleges that Ailes once offered to pay a female TV producer $100 extra a week for sex, a damning new book alleges.

While negotiating her salary at NBC in the 1980s, Randi Harrison claims Mr Ailes offered her the raise 'if you agree to have sex with me whenever I want.'

Fox News has denied the allegations.

In another anecdote, it was claimed that Mr Ailes was so dismissive of even his best talent that he referred to star host Bill O'Reilly as 'a book salesman with a TV show'.

Despite Ailes' denials about the veracity of the book, Sherman retorted in a statement to Politico:

'During two and a half years of reporting, I made a dozen requests both in writing and in person to speak with Roger Ailes about every aspect of my book,' he said.

Sherman also claimed that 'a team of two fact-checkers spent more than 2,000 hours vetting the manuscript before publication.'

'Roger Ailes declined every request to discuss the reporting with me.'

But the Fox News channel's flat denials on Ailes' behalf, and a lack of communication between Sherman's publisher and Fox News, may indicate that his sources led him astray.

'Random House refused to fact check the content with me or Fox News,' Ailes told The Hollywood Reporter. 'That tells you everything you need to know about this book and its agenda.'

Fox News confirmed to MailOnline that Sherman made interview requests but that neither he nor his publisher sent a list of questions for fact-checking prior to the book's publication.                                                                                                                                                 -- by Simon Tomlinson
