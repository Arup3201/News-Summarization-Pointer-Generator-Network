Guilty: Hugh Wade-Jones

A rich property broker who owns a Mayfair company with a £1.5m turnover has been convicted of dodging a £28 cab fare.

Hugh Wade-Jones, 31, tried to flee without paying the taxi driver after being driven home from a day of heavy drinking with colleagues on June 22.

Disgraced Wade-Jones manages 11 people as director of Enness Private Clients, which deals with clients seeking loans of £2.5m for high-value properties.

Tom Nicholson, defending, told the court: 'The real risk to his business is going to come from the FSA looking at the conviction.

'There is a real risk not only to impact on him, but to the 11 people he employs.'

Wade-Jones had lunch in Marylebone with colleagues from Deutsche Bank on June 21 before meandering through a string of pubs and clubs on his way to Liverpool Street.

The high-flying company director hailed a black cab at about midnight to make his way home to exclusive Hampstead, north London.

Wade-Jones, who is described on his website as 'goal driven', confessed to having had 'a huge, huge amount to drink'.

He jumped out of the cab without paying after being dropped off in Hampstead High Street, Highbury magistrates' court heard on August 23.

Driver Patrick James called police after following the drunken businessman to his home 'keeping the meter running until his passenger reached his door.'

After a boozy day, the property broker tried to flee from the cab without paying

Mortified Wade-Jones denied making off without paying but was found guilty of making off without a fare, and given a 12-month conditional discharge and ordered to pay £37 compensation and £600 to the Crown Prosecution Service.

The keen marathon runner said he was convinced he had already paid an agreed fee when he jumped in at Liverpool Street.

Wade-Jones said: 'All along my gut reaction is I am not someone who is going to run away from taxis.

'I can only stand by my gut feeling, but I am not going to hide the fact that I was extremely drunk.'

District Judge John Perkins said: 'By his actions, as recorded by Mr James, he was at that time trying to avoid payment for a taxi, something he would never dream of doing usually.

'I ask myself why he was behaving in a manner that was so out of character?

Wade-Jones was driven to exclusive Hampstead before he fled (his home is not pictured here)

'I conclude that a huge amount of drink as often is the case is the cause, but I don't find that it was to such an extent that his intention at that time was dishonest.'

His company website says that Wade-Jones is highly-respected in his industry.

It says: 'Property is in Hugh’s blood: he grew up in a family of property investors and rapidly rose to be a director of London’s largest mortgage broker.

'Our clients benefit from his unrivalled network of contacts in private and offshore banks. 

'His views on the mortgage market are often sought and quoted in the national press as well as writing regular columns for a number of financial publications. 

'Outside of work he is equally goal-driven: he is a sub-3 hour marathon runner and his next target is to box as a competitive amateur.'

A spokesman for Mr Wade-Jones claims: "The conviction has been disclosed to the FSA, there is no inquiry and the 'fit and proper person' test does not apply."
