Aston Villa's record signing Darren Bent is set to join Championship club Brighton on a short-term loan deal.

The former England international, signed for £18million in 2011, has made little impact under Paul Lambert at Villa Park, and Seagulls boss Sami Hyypia has swooped for the ex-Tottenham man.

Talks over a deal until January are at an advanced stage and could be concluded in the next 24 hours.

The 30-year-old forward joined the Midlands club for £18m but has struggled to get into the team recently

Bent joined Fulham on a season-long deal last season but scored just three goals in 24 games.

Another former England striker who could be on the move is Emile Heskey. The 36-year-old has revealed he would return to Leicester if he got a call from Nigel Pearson. Heskey, who began his career with Leicester, is without a club after two years in Australia with Newcastle Jets.

‘I’d love to come,’ he told BBC Radio. ‘It is a great club.’ Pearson’s side are in the bottom three but Heskey thinks they can stay up. ‘They have a decent squad, they just need that little pick me up,’ he added.

The former Tottenham man has played for six different clubs in his career and has also got 13 England caps

Last season Bent, who has not been favoured by Paul Lambert, was sent out on loan to Fulham
