A ship that was part of a famous fleet led by Sir Walter Raleigh, which sank without a trace, could have been found at last.

Scientists are testing the remains of a shipwreck thought to be the Flying Joan, which was scuppered as the legendary explorer began his search for the ‘Lost City of Gold’.

The 50ft boat set sail in 1617 as part of a fleet led by Sir Walter looking for the mythical riches of El Dorado.

It sailed from Plymouth, Devon, towards the West Indies, but was destroyed by a huge storm and sank without a trace.

The 120 tonne ship has lain on the sea bed for nearly 400 years but divers think they have finally found its remains off the coast of Cornwall, along with Tudor guns and pottery.

Early analysis of the wreckage has proved inconclusive but English Heritage has this week sent off hull samples to be carbon dated by experts in a bid to solve the mystery once and for all.

Divers Todd Stevens and Robin Burrows found the wreck in the summer of 2012 after using a magnetometer to pinpoint unusual objects on the seabed.

They say their photos and artefacts prove it is Sir Walter’s ship, but experts have never verified the find.

Sir Walter Raleigh (1554 - 1618) was an English aristocrat, writer, poet, soldier, politician, courtier, spy, and explorer.

He was popular with Queen Elizabeth I and instrumental of the English colonisation of North America, paving the way for settlements in Virginia.

In 1594 he heard about a 'City of Gold' in South America and sailed to find it, publishing an exaggerated account of his experiences in a book that contributed to the legend of 'El Dorado'.

But after Queen Elizabeth died in 1603, he was imprisoned in the Tower of London for being involved in the Main Plot against King James I.

In 1616, he was released to lead a second expedition in search of El Dorado in 1617, but it was unsuccessful and men under his command ransacked a Spanish outpost.

He returned to England and to appease the Spanish, was arrested and executed in 1618.

The Flying Joan, captained by John Chindley, was known to have sunk off Scilly on June 12, 1617 as it departed the West Country, led by Raleigh’s 440-tonne ship called The Destiny.

The fleet of 30 ships was scattered by a storm shortly after setting sail and two ships, including the Flying Joan, sank.

The expedition was Raleigh’s second 
failed attempt to find a ‘City of Gold’ thought to be somewhere between Trinidad and 
the north east coast of Venezuela.

Mark Dunkley, maritime designation advisor for English Heritage, said the carbon dating analysis will likely take several months.

‘The remains of Elizabethan wreck sites are extremely rare and when discovered in English waters, they are considered to be nationally important,’ he said.

‘English Heritage cannot commit to any association with Sir Walter Raleigh until we have completed our investigation of the site and have analysed the results of tree-ring dating, which we will be undertaking within the next few months, to determine whether the hull timbers are Elizabethan or not,’ he added.

The wreckage pictured is temporarily being called the Lizzy until samples are radiocarbon dates to determine whether the vessel belonged to Sir Walter Raleigh

remains off the coast of Cornwall, along with Tudor guns and Tudor pottery. Diver Todd Stevens is convinced the wreckage was part of Sir Walter's fleet. He holds a piece of pottery (left) and a metal ship part (right)
