More disturbing details have emerged telling of former dictator Muammar Gaddafi’s iron-fisted rule over Libya.

The despot kept the severed head of one of his enemies in a freezer for 25 years and built a secret sex dungeon on the campus of a college specifically to rape coeds, according to a new documentary on his brutal regime.

He also stored the bodies of other rivals he had killed and would visit them occasionally at a walk-in freezer. The sex chamber was built on the campus of Tripoli University.

The barbaric horrors are revealed in British filmmaker Christopher Olgiati’s new documentary called ‘Mad Dog: Inside the Secret World of Muammar Gaddafi.’

The film includes an interview with a renegade CIA operative Frank Terpil who ran a ‘murder for hire’ team used by Ghaddafi. The dictator dubbed it ‘Murder Incorporated.’

Terpil says in the film he was given $1m to kill one of the dictator's rivals and deliver his head back to Libya.

Terpil claims Ghaddafi, who was killed by rebels two years ago after his regime was overthrown, kept the head in a freezer along with the bodies of other victims he had murdered.

‘I was in Geneva… [a Ghadaffi relative] opened up a letter of credit for a million dollars for [the target's] demise, on the caveat that his head be delivered back in a cooler to Libya so Gaddafi could actually look at the results of the work,’ he says in the biopic, according to the Post.

Terpil fled to Cuba after being sentenced to 53 years in prison for illegal arms deals, according to the New York Post.

A separate source claims the depraved dictator would often visit the frozen bodies of his enemies, sometimes as much as 25 years later.’

The documentary team also found evidence of the depraved dictator's secret sex den at Tripoli University he had built to rape students after giving speeches on the campus.

‘The untouched room contains a bed, Jacuzzi and area where the women were checked for STDs, with surgical instruments, rubber masks and anaesthesia,’ Olgiati told the Post.

‘[Gaddafi] was utterly charming, utterly ruthless and stupendously rich,’ Olgiati continued. ‘He was driven solely by his lust for power.’

‘Mad Dog’ will air Friday on Showtime.
