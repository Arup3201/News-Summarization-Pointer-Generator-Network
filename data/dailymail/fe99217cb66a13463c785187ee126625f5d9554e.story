This unsightly and unshapely Christmas tree, with just a few sorry-looking bulbs and baubles, was slammed as Britain's worst festive decoration this week after crowds jeered at its big unveiling.

About a thousand people, including excited children, turned out in the bitter cold to watch pantomime stars Gareth Gates and Toyah Wilcox flick the switch to turn on Herne Bay's Christmas lights.

But they were left stunned when the 'shocking' lights, which barely covered the tree, flickered into life.

Many stormed off in disgust as boos and jeers rang out.

'Atrocious': Crowds booed as lights on this Christmas tree in Herne Bay, Kent flickered into life. The town had persuaded panto stars Gareth Gates and Toyah Wilcox to turn on the decorations, but crowds were left bitterly disappointed

It later emerged that Canterbury City Council spent a whopping £83,000 on Christmas tree decorations for Canterbury, Whitstable and Herne Bay this year, though the Herne Bay business association were responsible for funding the tree.

One resident condemned the decorations as looking like a couple of domestic lightbulbs, while a local businessman laughingly claimed he had more decorations in his shop window.

Other shop owners claimed the pathetic decorations would affect their vital Christmas trade. They had been encouraged to open late for last Friday's switch-on but most potential shoppers had drifted away by 5.45pm.

Greengrocer Stan Truelove, 57, said: 'It took me an hour to put some lights and a few decorations up in my shop and it definitely looks better than these lights.

'We were asked to keep our shops open until 7pm but everyone left at 5.45pm.

'Christmas tree lights are supposed to put you in the mood for shopping but no one will want to spend money here.

'The lights are a waste of money because they look terrible.'

Steve Warrener, a sports shop owner, added: 'I think it must have been embarrassing for the council.

'There were a lot of people there and we had two stars in Gareth Gates and Toyah Wilcox. What must they have thought?

'There was no wow factor there at all. I just walked away.'

Sparse: Residents and local shop owners said the unsightly tree would do little to entice Christmas shoppers to the town

A disappointed mother-of-three, who asked not to be named, said: 'I could not believe how bad the lights are.

'It was supposed to be this grand unveiling but the lights look atrocious - they were so bad people started booing.

'I think it must be the country's worst set of Christmas lights.'

Salon owner Lou Richards added: 'I'm absolutely fuming. Why would you come to Herne Bay to see light bulbs? The tree is an absolute joke.'

Canterbury City Council have launched a consultation over the Christmas lights.

A spokesman said: 'The display in Herne Bay this year is the same as last year's, with the exception of some netting.

'Consultation on Christmas lights will start with businesses soon and we'll be keen to talk to those traders who are showing an interest in the display in their towns.'

The council had provided £83,000 to pay for the decorations in Canterbury, Whitstable and Herne Bay.

They added that the Herne Bay business association was responsible for raising any extra funds for the tree.

But Coastal Towns manger Chris West said: 'There was more than a thousand people and it was bigger crowd than in Whitstable.'
