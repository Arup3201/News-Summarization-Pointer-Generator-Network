Road rage killer Tracie Andrews has set up home with a married father-of-four who ditched his wife for her.

Two years after she was released from prison for stabbing her fiance Lee Harvey 42 times, she is pictured with new lover Phil Goldsworthy, 52.

Now calling herself Jenna Stephens and with her appearance changed by dark hair and plastic surgery, Andrews is reportedly playing housewife at the home he shared with his wife, Linsie, in South West England.

Killer Tracie Andrews, who stabbed her boyfriend to death and blamed it on a road-rage stranger, has moved in with a father-of-four who allegedly dumped his wife for her.

Killer Tracie Andrews and boyfriend Phil Goldsworthy were spotted holding hands as they strolled round the shops

Andrews, 44, completed jobs around the 
52-year-old's semi-detached house near St Ives, Cornwall, before she 
headed out with him to do a spot of shopping, the Sunday Mirror reported.

Despite being sentenced to life imprisonment in 1997 for the murder of Lee Harvey, Andrews was released on licence after just 14 years in 2011.

Her aim then was to slip back into the community unnoticed and she has tried to build up a new life after her horrific crime.

She not only changed her name but also attempted to change her appearance.

Phil Goldsworthy is currently divorcing his wife Linsie and has moved in with the cold-hearted killer who stabbed her fiance 42 times with a penknife

Tracie Andrews claimed her boyfriend had been murdered by a stranger

This included a £5,000 operation, paid 
for by the NHS, to correct her distinctive protruding jaw. Her mane of 
blonde hair also disappeared and was replaced by a dyed black bob.

And it would appear that she has formed a new life for herself as she settled into Mr Goldsworthy's home.

Mrs Goldsworthy, a mother-of-two, has previously bitterly accused Andrews of being involved in the breakdown of their relationship.

She claimed Andrews showered Mr Goldsworthy with gifts, and described how they became close while working together.

Last year Mrs Goldsworthy said her husband was 'fascinated' by the cold-hearted killer.

'If we went out with friends, he would say excitedly: "Guess who’s working at the pub? The woman who stabbed her boyfriend to death",' she said.

'He would defend her from any criticism, claiming she had changed.

'He used to say she looked like Kat Slater from EastEnders — and he has always fancied her.

'Then he started coming home from the pub at 4am, claiming they were really busy.'

After the discovery of a text message between the pair, says Mrs Goldsworthy, she and her husband split up.

Andrews stabbed Lee with a penknife 42 times during a violent row. Despite forensic evidence confirming her guilt, she denied the charges at trial

But Mr Goldsworthy has insisted his estranged wife's version of events was ‘all lies’ and that he and his wife broke up before Andrews came on the scene.

Andrews tried to convince the nation of her innocence when she gave an interview at a press conference.

Occasionally weeping and sporting buises, Andrews clutched Lee's mother Maureen’s hand as she described how a road-rage assailant stabbed 25-year-old Lee following a cat-and-mouse car chase through Worcestershire as the couple drove home from the pub.

But her recollection was revealed to be a complete lie.

Jealous, possessive and volatile, Andrews had stabbed Lee with a penknife 42 times during a violent row.

Despite forensic evidence confirming her guilt, she denied the charges at trial.

It was only 21 months after she was convicted that she confessed to killing Lee, claiming self-defence, in a letter to her solicitor, despite Lee sustaining a stab wound to his back.
