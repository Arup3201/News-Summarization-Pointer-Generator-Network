Ian Rush believes Gareth Bale or Aaron Ramsey can break his Wales all-time goalscoring record.

Rush scored 28 goals for his county and Gareth Bale is already halfway towards his tally having netted 14 times in 47 matches for Wales.

The former Liverpool striker added that Arsenal talisman Aaron Ramsey, who is currently on eight international goals is also capable of surpassing his record. 

Gareth Bale has already scored 14 goals for Wales and is aiming to overtake Ian Rush's record

'There's no reason why Bale can't, but I think Aaron Ramsey is in that category as well,' Rush told the BBC.

'It's nice having a record but if someone like Gareth Bale or Aaron Ramsey broke it I'll be happy because it means Wales are doing well.'

Bale became the World's most expensive player in September 2013 when he joined Real Madrid for a mouth watering £85m.

Bale signed for Real Madrid for a world record £85m and has taken the weight of expectation in his stride

He has scored 11 goals in his last 18 appearances and is in a rich vein of form on the international stage having scored twice against Andorra in Wales' European qualifying match against the Minnows.

Ramsey, was absent from Wales' last two qualifiers against Bosnia-Herzegovina and Cyprus through injury, but is expected to have a huge impact upon his return to the Wales fold.

'They are playing more games now and they are young,' said Rush, who played for Wales between 1980 and 1996, 'so I'm sure one of them will break it one day.'

Aaron Ramsey return against Belgium will be a huge boost for national team as they look to beat Belgium

Wales currently top their qualifying group and face a formidable task against Belgium away from home in their next match in November

Rush insists Wales' hopes are pinned on Bale and Ramsey as they look to secure what would be a monumental victory against Belgium.

'That's the two players that are going to win the games, who will score you the goals,' said Rush.

'There's no reason why we can't get something out of the game.

'It's a big game for us but it's a big game for Belgium as well.'

Wales have not qualified for the finals of a major tournament since the 1958 World Cup and Rush hopes to see his record broken at the Euro 2016 finals in France.

'I didn't get to play in a major tournament for Wales,' said Rush, 'but my ambition is, while I'm still alive to see Wales hopefully in a major competition.

'If they [Bale or Ramsey] break my record doing that then it would be the icing on the cake.'
