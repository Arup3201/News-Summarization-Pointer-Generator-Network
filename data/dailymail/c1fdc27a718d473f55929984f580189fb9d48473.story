A postman has documented the tales of being on the job by taking photos while he delivers.

Seth Miller from Missouri has been dropping off mail for three years and decided to start taking pictures after stray dogs started following him on his route.

The 21-year-old has encountered  grumpy stick insects, cross cows and chickens as well as several overly-affectionate dogs over the years.

Postman Seth Miller, 21, has documented the tales of being on the job by taking photos while he delivers letters. He has encountered several animals and pets including a dog who jumped into his van one day

What you looking at? Moo-ve along! He said over the years he has come across cross cows (pictured)

While he encounters overly-affectionate dogs, he also has met problematic dogs, who he says are not pictured in his photo album because he's too busy avoiding them

Seth said: 'The dog which jumped into my van was particularly interested in following me. 

'When I got back from deliveries and opened my van door he thought we were doing for a ride. 

'Unfortunately we don't deliver dogs - so I had to kick him out.'

As if to confirm a widely-held belief, dogs have proved the most problematic animals on his rounds, he said: 'The really mean dogs aren't in the album because I'm too busy trying to avoid them.

Among animals he has seen during the day include adorable kittens on the front porch of a home

No ordinary days for Seth from Missouri who comes across lizards and chickens while out on the job

Creepy critters like this stick insect are among the unsual encourters that make his delivery job interesting

'I have had trouble with one dog in particular. I've figured out his name is called Tyler, because I've heard his owners yelling the name so often.

'It's possible they have an unruly kid by that name - but this dog looks like a Tyler.

'He's never chained up, and is always on a mission to protect his garden.

'There is another particularly difficult dog which is chained up, but still in reach of the mailbox.

'I'm not too worried about him though - I don't think he has too many teeth left.'

Seth said one of the dogs that give him trouble (not pictured) he is not too worried about because he does not have many teeth left

Just hanging around - the postman saw in passing a cat relaxing in a bathtub while on his delivery route
