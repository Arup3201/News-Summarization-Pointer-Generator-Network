Flying off the shelves: More than a million children unwrapped a console this Christmas

Games consoles flew off the shelves at a phenomenal rate before Christmas, with shops around Britain shifting, on average, one machine every SECOND. 

That remarkable figure means that more than a million children unwrapped a console on the big day itself – no doubt as their indulgent parents gazed happily on.

But parents expecting PlayStation 4s and XBox Ones to provide their offspring with puzzles to solve, or colourful worlds to explore, could be in for an unpleasant – and grisly – shock. 

While the high-powered consoles themselves offer more life-like play than ever before, most parents do not realise this means the violence and depravity featured in the best-selling games will be depicted in sickeningly realistic detail. 

There are games suitable for small children, but peer pressure means many of the teenagers who provide the core audience for video games will want to play the heavily promoted 18 Certificate products. 

Indeed, seven out of the top ten sellers this Christmas were either blood-soaked ‘first-person shooters’ (where players look through the eyes of a gunman) or gruesome horror titles.

Even more concerning is the fact that the new consoles are built for online gaming and ‘voice chat’ via headsets – which can lead to impressionable teenagers being exposed to foul language and worse, regardless of which titles they choose.

The recent murder of 14-year-old Breck Bednar was linked to a chat service that teenage killer Lewis Daynes used to ‘groom’ his victim, turning him against his friends and family before killing him.

Both were dedicated players of the bloodthirsty war game Battlefield 4 and were part of an online group of fans of the game.

One of the most notorious games is the British-made Grand Theft Auto V (GTA), which has been released in an ‘enhanced’ version. 

The game has been condemned as misogynist and sexually violent by many critics – and taken off the shelves by two leading Australian retail chains.

The game contains scenes where players can have virtual sex with prostitutes then beat them up and steal their money, and a scene of torture where the player is expected to remove a gang rival’s teeth one by one using the joy pad, which vibrates as the victim begs for mercy.

It also includes scenes where the player smokes marijuana, and takes the dangerous hallucinogenic drug peyote. There is also a brief instance of necrophilia. Yet GTA V is one of the top-selling computer games in the world.

Vivienne Pattinson, director of anti-violence group MediaWatch said: ‘Grand Theft Auto is a violent game which allows players to be violent not just towards women but men too.’ However GTA’s depiction of female characters is broadly one-dimensional with women portrayed in the main as prostitutes, naggers or powerless damsels in distress.

Ms Pattinson added: ‘Research published earlier this year found that hours spent playing violent video games was effectively stunting emotional growth. 

There are lots of games which are not violent and misogynistic but developers need to provide a product that will be talked about and sometimes pushing the boundaries is an easy way to do this.’

Modern computer games can take as much money to develop as Hollywood films – and violence is a sure-fire way to recoup that investments. One of the newest titles, Destiny, a first-person shooter with a science fiction theme, cost £320 million to make, but recouped its entire development budget on the first day of release.

Last night Dr Jo Twist, chief executive officer of games industry trade body Ukie, said: ‘Games have clear age ratings and content descriptions.

‘In addition, all games devices, including mobiles, have parental controls to make sure age-appropriate content and games are played by younger players.’
