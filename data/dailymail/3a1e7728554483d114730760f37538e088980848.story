Julian Assange's Wikileaks Party has come under fire after it emerged that it sent a delegation led by his father to Damascus to meet President Bashar Assad.

John Shipton, father of Mr Assange, was pictured sitting alongside the Syrian dictator in a photo circulated on Twitter by the regime that was apparently taken on December 23.

Mr Shipton is on the national council of the Wikileaks Party, which was set up to contest Australia's senate elections in September but polled just 0.7 per cent of the vote and gained no seats.

Poor judgement? Syrian President Bashar Assad with John Shipton, the father of whistleblowing activist Julian Assange, during the visit to the war-torn country by a delegation from Australia's Wikileaks Party

Reports claimed Mr Shipton said on Syrian TV that Wikileaks plans to open a Damascus office 'to show the solidarity of the Australian people and the Wikileaks Party with the difficulties that Syria is having at the moment.'

He reportedly told Syrian English-language news programme The News: 'I think that the Syrian people in their courage are an example to the rest of the world in how to resist this plague of terrorism which is sweeping the Middle East and Central Asia.

'We'll continue to expose the truth to the Australian people and to our international audience and next year we'll set up an office in Damascus.'

As controversy boiled over the visit, Mr Shipton today told the Sydney Morning Herald that the visit was being used for propaganda purposes by the Assad regime, and that the delegation was not trying to side with the government.

'He [President Assad] invited us to call in and have a cup of tea and it was difficult to snub him,' he said.

'We just went along, said hello, didn't say anything much actually. If something is central to the prosperity of the west and the world and could lead to a world war, then you've got to look at it whatever way you can.

'Our commitment is to peace and the unfolding of the facts and the Syrian people, not to a particular government.'

Matt Watt, the Wikileaks Party's national secretary, said the visit was a 'fact-finding, rebuilding, reconstruction and peace mission', but he admitted that the regime's help had been sought in gaining access.

According to reports, the delegation toured the sights of Damascus and met with Antiochian Orthodox patriarch John X, Syrian prime minister Wael al-Halqi, deputy foreign minister Faisal Miqdad and the speaker of the Syrian People's Assembly Jihad al-Laham.

'They have had to be very careful on this trip,' Mr Watts told The Australian.

'Obviously you can't just walk across the border, so it is an organised trip with the government to gain access, and that's put some restrictions on them.'

Mr Shipton said that he and his fellow travellers had also met with opposition figures, but he admitted that 'of course people are going to use you.'

'What they do with our visit in Syria, you can't stop. You have no control over that,' he told the Sydney Morning Herald.

Wikileaks distanced itself from the actions of its political offshoot, saying on its official Twitter account today: 'Peace brokering a good idea, but (it was) obvious (the) meeting would be spun without care.

'Did not know or approve.'
