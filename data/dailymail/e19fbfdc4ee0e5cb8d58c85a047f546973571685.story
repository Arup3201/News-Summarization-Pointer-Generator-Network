Blinded: Burglars sprayed Jack the border collie as they looted his owners' home in Shaw, Greater Manchester, earlier this month

Burglars blinded a puppy by spraying ammonia in its face as they ransacked its owners' house for £10,000 worth of valuables.

It is thought the criminals attacked Jack the border collie when he began barking at them as they looted the home of Graham and Jean Wharmby in Shaw, Oldham, Greater Manchester earlier this month.

After spraying the one-year-old dog with the toxic liquid, the burglars took off with £10,000 worth of valuables, including three laptops, a mobile phone and Mrs Wharmby's mother's wedding ring - which had been in her family for four generations.

Police are now looking for the criminals, who targeted the two-bedroom bungalow while Mr and Mrs Wharmby, both 60, were out grocery shopping.

Mrs Wharmby, who is terminally ill following treatment for cancer, said: 'It's unbelievable the depths some yobs will stoop to simply to rob people's homes.

'It's
 a wonder he's not blind and if we had been any longer Jack could have 
passed out from power the fumes.

'It's just wrong what these people did 
and so s cruel. They must have gone in the kitchen looking for stuff 
because he is in there when we go out.

'They could have quite easily 
have left him. He would have barked at them when he heard them and would
 have jumped up. They must have got him first to get him away.

'We were 
only out of the house for just over an hour and it was the first time 
I'd been out for four months due to illness. They must have been 
watching the house.

'It was so callous. I doubt these yobboes have any conscience whatsoever. '

Jack was treated by a vet before returning home, where Mrs Wharmby said he is now recovering well from the attack. Tests revealed that his blindness was only temporary.

The raid took place between 10.30am and 11.30am on 15 August after Mr and Mrs Wharmby went out to buy groceries. It is thought the burglars forced open a dining room window before creeping into the house.

Mrs Wharmby, a former professional cake maker, added: 'When we came back we could smell the Ammonia straight away and we could see all the cupboard doors were open and the bedrooms ransacked.

'Jack was still wagging his tail and came to the door but it was clear he couldn't see properly. They had come armed with this and taken it back with them.

'Ammonia was all over the floor in the kitchen and we couldn't come into the house until the fire brigade had come.

Loyal: Mrs Wharmby said that one-year-old Jack was still wagging his tail when she returned home with her husband. The burglars took £10,000 worth of valuables in the raid

'Jack was trying to wipe his eyes but his paws had been in it - his eyes were all ulcerated especially his left one. They even got ambulance for Graham because of the fumes. The fire brigade came in with all the breathing equipment, we couldn't go in the house for an hour.

'Jack's coat was covered in ammonia and he had to be put outside. The RSPCA came and he had to have his eyes cleaned. They put a dye in to see how bad it was. His eyes were a bluish colour.

'It has made his eyes discoloured and we thought he would be blinded. He is a poor defenceless animal. Now if he hears any noises or if people pass he barks, he's very protective of me.

'He is only 12 months old, he is still only a puppy. He is very nice natured. I dread to think what they might have done if I was there.'

Irreplaceable: The burglars took a gold watch belonging to Mrs Wharmby's grandmother as well as her mother's wedding ring, which had been in her family for four generations

She explained that the beloved dog now has to have eye drops four times a day. She said that the police had never known an animal to be targeted in a similar attack.

She continued: 'They had ransacked the bedrooms and taken all my jewellery from the boxes and safety boxes including my mum's wedding ring. They had broken open the boxes with a screwdriver.

'The jewellery was sentimental but it was Jack who we were more bothered about. He has been such a good companion to me and he doesn't like me being on my own. He has helped with my illness. I couldn't bear to think of life without him.

Recovering: Jack the border collie, pictured at 12 weeks old, was treated for the painful injuries he suffered to his eyes before returning home, where he is now recovering well from the attack

'They have taken my grandma's gold watch and my emeralds and diamonds and sapphire rings.

'They also took my mum's wedding ring which was four generations old as she had my great grandma's, my grandma's wedding ring melted to make hers. There was also three laptops and an i-Phone.

'I think they must have seen us coming back and left. One of the neighbour's saw two men round the back, a young one with a hoodie and an older one. I'm now too frightened of going out.'

PC Tom Nicholson of Greater Manchester Police said: 'Not only did the homeowners come back to see their house had been broken into but their beloved dog had been needlessly sprayed in the face with ammonia.

Desperate: Jack, pictured at six months old, was rubbing his eyes with his paws when an inspector from the RSPCA arrived at the two-bedroomed bungalow. She said that the pet looked like it was in great pain

'The dog was in a lot of pain, had injuries to the eyes and was temporarily blinded. He needed treatment at the vets but thankfully they are recovering well.

'I would ask people who may have been walking or driving in the area at the time of the burglary and witnessed anything suspicious, to contact us.'

RSPCA Inspector Charlotte Melvin said: 'This was a horrific and needless attack on a young dog as part of a burglary.

Target: The burglars raided the home in Shaw, Greater Manchester (pictured), while Mr and Mrs Wharmby were out grocery shopping on Friday 15 August. They returned after an hour to find their kitchen covered in ammonia

'The fumes from the chemical were overwhelming as I opened the door. The dog was rubbing his face because he was in so much pain.

'I took him to the vet where they gave him some painkillers and put dye in his eyes to show-up the damage. One of his eyes was completely ulcerated, fortunately the other was not so badly damaged.

'I would urge anyone who knows anything about this burglary and the attack on Jack to contact the police.'
