A nationwide crash of two of the country's largest mobile phone networks has been dismissed as 'less than perfect' by one of the telco's technology experts - and the reason for the meltdown remains unknown.

Vodafone and Optus Mobile customers were unable to call or text for several hours on Thursday, with coverage only returning at about 6.30pm. The companies are also yet to confirm how many people were effected.

In a statement issued on Friday, Vodafone's Chief Technology Officer, Benoit Hanssen, played down the meltdown - before announcing the company will be providing free data to all of its customers this weekend.

'We know our customers had a less than perfect network experience today and we want them to know we're sorry. We want to make good by offering them unlimited data access all weekend,' Mr Hanssen said.

Customers will have access to the unlimited data from midnight on Friday until 3am on Monday, June 23.

The statement explained that Western Australia was the first to be hit by the transmission network failure at 11am on Thiursday, before it spread nationally at around 1pm.

By 4.10pm, the company guaranteed services were restored across the country, while coverage problems dragged on in WA before being restored at 6.30pm.

However, despite Optus customers also experiencing network outages, the telco company is yet to release an official statement.

A spokeswoman for Optus told the MailOnline that 'the issue has been resolved for all customers', however the cause of the network failure is yet to be determined and is 'still being investigated'.

The company is also unsure of how many customers were affected by the outage.

However the problems also affected those using Amaysim and Virgin Mobile, which are part of the Optus network.

Optus customers received updates over social media about the situation on Thursday night.

'UPDATE 2: The majority of our customers affected by this issue now have normal service again,' Optus wrote on Twitter at 6.35pm on Thursday.

'Our teams are still working to restore the remaining services for customers still affected. We apologise for any inconvenience caused.'

Meanwhile mobile phone users across Australia also took to social media to vent their anger.

Jarrod Rudd wrote: 'I absolutely hope I get compensated for my problems that I cannot rectify, which are your company's fault because your lines are down.'

Vanessa Rasmussen Bettina fumed: 'We pay for a service... Constant outages and then having to call to get them to compensate me is insulting. If it's not working we should not be paying.'

A post on Vodafone's Facebook page around lunchtime said: 'Hi everyone, we've just had confirmation that we're currently experiencing some network issues. We're working to restore these issues as soon as possible and we'll keep you updated throughout in this thread.'

The company is unsure how many people were affected because the outage was 'intermittent'.

The spokeswoman explained: 'At times some people could make and receive calls.'

Meanwhile, Optus advised customers via Twitter to turn their phones on and off to fix the problem.

'Those customers affected, please turn your phone off & then on. This should fix the problem. We apologise again for the inconvenience,' they wrote.

Earlier in the day they said: 'We are aware of an issue affecting some Optus customers at the moment. We're currently investigating the problem and will keep you updated.'
