Two of the three women held captive for a decade in a Cleveland house
are collaborating with a Pulitzer Prize-winning team of Washington Post
reporters for a planned book about their ordeal.

In a 
statement issued Monday, an attorney for Amanda 
Berry and Gina DeJesus said they will work with the Post's Mary Jordan, a
Cleveland native, and her husband and fellow reporter, Kevin Sullivan.

No meetings with publishers have been scheduled, although interest would
likely be based on the popularity of another kidnapping survivor's 
memoir, Jaycee Dugard's A Stolen Life.

Victims: Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus have agreed to write a book about their terrible ordeal

Hometown: Cleveland native Mary Jordan will write the book about the women kidnapped by Castro

Negotiations for the 
book will be handled by Washington-based attorney Robert Barnett, whose 
clients have included President Barack Obama and Amanda Knox.

'Many
have told, and continue to tell, this story in ways that are both 
inaccurate and beyond the control of these young women,' said James 
Wooley, the attorney for Berry and DeJesus.

'Our clients have a strong 
desire for privacy, but it is a reality that confronts them every day. 
Gina, Amanda and their families have decided to take control and are now
interested in telling the story of what happened to them.'

Wooley
said in his statement that he had known Jordan for years and contacted 
her about the project.

Jordan told the AP during a recent interview that
she was drawn to the 'resilience' of Berry and DeJesus and was eager to
help them tell an 'amazing story of overcoming adversity.'

Monster: Ariel Castro was found dead in his prison cell last month after apparently hanging himself

In 2003, she
and Sullivan won a Pulitzer for their series about the Mexican criminal
justice system.

Berry, DeJesus and Michelle Knight were all 20
or younger when they were kidnapped between 2002 and 2004 by Ariel 
Castro, a former school bus driver. They were rescued from Castro's 
house on May 6 when Berry broke through a screen door and called 911.

Investigators said the women were bound, repeatedly raped and deprived 
of food and bathroom facilities.

Castro was sentenced Aug. 1 to
life in prison plus 1,000 years after pleading guilty to 937 counts, 
including kidnapping and rape, in a deal to avoid the death penalty.

He 
hanged himself in his cell in September.
