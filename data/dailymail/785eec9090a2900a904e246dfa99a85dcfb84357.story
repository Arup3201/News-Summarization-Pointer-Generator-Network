Stuart Broad took a hat-trick in England's second Test against Sri Lanka - but he didn't even know it!

The 27-year-old bowler began with the wicket of Kumar Sangakkara and then sent Dinesh Chandimal and tailender Shaminda Eranga packing with first two balls of the next over.

However, Broad, his team-mates and the crowd, were unaware of his treble due to the change of ends.

'I was listening to the guy that came on the tannoy there and I was thinking "why is he mentioning the last ball of the over before?", and it clicked that that might be a hat-trick' he told Sky sports.

He became the 13th Englishman to take a hat-trick and only the fourth player to do so twice.

 Plunkett's five-wicket haul had put England in the driving seat as 
Alastair Cook's side went on to dismiss Sri Lanka for 257 runs at 
Headingley.

Broad added: 'It was an excellent bowling performance all round, Liam's got the five wickets and Jimmy (Anderson, two for 49) tied an end up really well.

'There's always pressure when you win the toss and bowl, you sort of think it should be 200 all out, but we're pleased with 270 and to get off 15 overs early.

'We had an awkward hour or so there and I think that Sangakkara wicket was the big one.'
