Queens Park Rangers have confirmed that former player Les Ferdinand has been named the club's new head of football operations.

The move has been mooted for a while and with Richard Allen moving on to take up a role with the Football Association, Ferdinand has filled the void.

The 47-year-old was seen deep in discussion with chairman Tony Fernandes and chief executive Phil Beard on Sunday as QPR crashed to defeat at West Ham, as a result leaving them rock bottom of the Premier League, fuelling speculation the former R's forward was set for a return to W12.

Ferdinand, who spent eight years of his playing career at Loftus Road, worked under Tim Sherwood at Spurs last season but left the club after Mauricio Pochettino's appointment this summer.

Fernandes had previously said there was no position for the former R's striker in a Director of Football role, but was always keen to take on the former prolific hitman if a role came up elsewhere.

The Rangers chairman said recently on the former R's striker: 'My focus is trying to develop the academy — Les is one of the many names we're looking at. I'd love to see him come back to QPR but we'll have to wait and see.'

R's boss Harry Redknapp was particularly keen to get Ferdinand on board, knowing the qualities he can bring to the table after working with him during his time as Spurs boss.

The 67-year-old told the club's official website: 'I'm pleased to welcome Les back to the club.

'There's no doubting the qualities he'll bring to the role, having enjoyed a great time here as a player.' 

Ferdinand expressed his delight on the news saying: 'It's incredible to be back here. This club holds a special place in my heart. Everyone knows what it means to me, so when the opportunity to return here in this role came up I jumped at the opportunity.

'There's nothing I want more than for QPR to be successful in the short, medium and long term and I'm excited about the challenge ahead.'

Meanwhile, chairman Fernandes added: 'Football has changed considerably in recent years and I firmly believe there is a role at every football club for this kind of position. Les is a fantastic QPR man and I know the fans will join me in welcoming him back to a place he has a great fondness for.'
