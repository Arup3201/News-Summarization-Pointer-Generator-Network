Commuters will spend an average 10,634 hours travelling to and from work, research reveals

It may sometimes feel like even longer, but British commuters really do spend more than a year of their lives travelling to work - at a total cost of more than £50,000, new research reveals today (Monday).

In London the average is actually even higher - at 18 months and a cost of more than £66,000.

The figures are revealed in new research from investment management firm Nutmeg.

It calculates that over a lifetime, commuters will spend an average 10,634 hours travelling to and from work. That adds up to 443 days, or nearly a year and three months.

It's even longer for those travelling to or in London for work who will spend 18 months (or 13,097 hours) on the move, compared to ten and a half months (7,532 hours) for those travelling for work in Liverpool.

London commuters spend most time on the move - enduring an hour and 14 minutes travelling each day on average.

They are followed by Manchester (1 hour 4 minutes), Bristol (1 hour), Sheffield (59 minutes), Birmingham (56 minutes), Glasgow and Edinburgh (both 52 minutes), and Cardiff (50 minutes). Those commuting in Leeds and Liverpool experience the shortest commute at just 42 minutes.

On average, London workers spend £118 a month travelling to work each month, followed by those in Manchester (£78), and Bristol (£74). Those who travel to work in Glasgow pay the least at £63 a month, just ahead of Birmingham and Cardiff (£64).

The Nutmeg report notes: 'Without taking into consideration inflation on train tickets and petrol, over a working lifetime commuters travelling to a major city for work will spend on average £50,000.

'London workers expected to spend the most at almost £66,407. Those travelling in Glasgow city for work experienced the cheapest commute at £35,500.' 'London commuters pay an 88per cent travel premium', it noted.

When questioned on their 'biggest bugbears', the cost of commuting tied with traffic jams at the top of the poll, with a third (32per cent) saying these were their biggest annoyances.

They were followed by delays (30 per cent), dangerous or bad drivers (27 per cent), journey lengths (17 per cent), overcrowding (17 per cent), other people's personal music (13 per cent), poor commuter etiquette such as hogging two seats (12 per cent) and cyclists (11 per cent).

Londoners spend most time travelling, with an average commute of one hour and 14 minutes a day

The report notes that a fifth who commute do so because it is too expensive to buy or rent closer to their workplace. And just over one in five (21per cent) believe they have a better standard of living away from work.

Better schools and larger properties for the family was the main reason for not living closer to work for one in eight (12per cent) commuters.

On affordability, more than half (51per cent) of Londoners deemed travel costs expensive. Those based in Birmingham were happiest with the cost of their commute, with only a quarter (25per cent) deeming it was expensive.

Costs also proved to be too much for almost one in 12 (8per cent) who changed jobs or plan to following an increase in the cost of travel.

One in seven (14per cent) have or plan to cut back on the amount put into savings and investments and just under one in 10 (9per cent) have changed or plan to change their route to and from work.

It coincides with new research from used car website Motors.co.uk which says more than two thirds of drives (67per cent) would happily take a pay-cut and work locally in a bid to cut the cost of their commute.

By contrast just over one in five Britons (22per cent) say they would be willing to commute for an hour or more to receive higher salaries, according to the research polled more than 2,000 adults in Great Britain.

Nick Hungerford, chief executive at Nutmeg said: 'Travelling to work is one of the biggest costs of modern living, both in terms of actual expenditure and the time we spend journeying between the home and the office.

'While we may get more property for our money - and more fresh air - by living outside the city we work in, travel costs can quickly mount up and the daily commute can be soul-sapping.

'More than a fifth of people we surveyed admitted they wasted the time they spent travelling to and from work. With the total lifetime commute in London exceeding £65,000 and 10,000 hours, that's a substantial part of your life - and your life savings - that you'll want to make the most of.'

Phill Jones, commercial director of Motors.co.uk said: 'The people of Britain have clearly reached the edge of their frustration with the amount of money they sacrifice each year on commuting costs.

'The British public is fed up with having to waste their hard earned cash on things like commuting costs and parking fines when in reality, they urgently need it to heat their homes, feed their families and enjoy a decent quality of life.'

British motorists travel an average of 16.7 miles a day to get to work. But with an average car costing up to 50p per mile in fuel, Britain's drivers are predicted to pay as much as £3,048 a year on commuting costs, says the Motors.co.uk report.
