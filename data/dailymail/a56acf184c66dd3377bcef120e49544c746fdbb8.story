The Cheltenham Festival began yesterday with its most tragic day for six years.

Three horses were put down after suffering serious injuries.

Spectators and TV viewers watched in horror as the first, Scotsirish – who had been the favourite to win his race – broke a hind leg at a hurdle. The horse’s distress was witnessed by millions in TV footage as he was pulled up.

Another runner in the same race, Garde Champetre, was also destroyed after sustaining a similar injury.

Officials later announced that a third
horse, Educated Evans, was to be put down after falling in the 2½-mile 
novice chase – the final event of the day.

The tragedies infuriated animal rights
groups. One, Animal Aid, warned that the ground was ‘dangerously firm’ 
and claimed races ‘should never have taken place’.

Of the event that claimed the lives of
Scotsirish and Garde Champetre – the seven-furlong cross-country 
handicap chase – a spokesman for the group said: ‘Rather than take the 
precautionary step of calling off the race, officials risked the lives 
of the horses, and two paid the ultimate price.’

The claims were vigorously denied by race organisers last night.

They said the course and its obstacles had been inspected several times to ensure that it was safe.

‘It was watered and it was deemed 
perfectly fine to race on by the course inspector,’ a British 
Horseracing Authority spokesman said.

The deaths are sure to reignite debate over whether horse-racing is an unnecessarily cruel sport.

Before yesterday’s deaths, nine horses had been killed at the Cheltenham Festival between 2007 and 2011.

In 2006, 11 horses were killed, including six on one day. Three of those came after the novice chase.

Critics say the Festival puts horses under enormous pressure due to its big, noisy crowds and frenetic atmosphere.

Fury: Animal welfare groups have reacted angrily following the deaths of the three horses on the first day's racing at the Cheltenham Festival

They also warn that many of the races feature too many horses, making it difficult  for the animals to judge  their jumps.

However, race organisers say they take
horse safety ‘very seriously’ – and that campaign groups such as Animal
Aid are not welfare organisations, but ‘extremists’.

A spokesman for 
the BHA said: ‘Like most competitive sports, racing carries risks. No 
one wants to see valuable and valued racehorses killed and injured.

‘It is regrettable that three horses 
suffered accidents where the injury was not treatable and so euthanasia 
was the proper and humane option.

‘Racecourses, horse-racing trainers 
and the sport’s regulator are not complacent about these risks, and 
recognise there is still more to do, including both on-going 
improvements and scientific research, to further reduce these risks.’ 
Animal Aid said they planned to hold a protest at Cheltenham today to 
remind racegoers of ‘the heavy price paid by horses’ at the event.

A spokesman for the group said: ‘More 
horses have been killed at Cheltenham Racecourse than at any other in 
the country over the past five years – a little-known statistic that the
owners of the course will not be keen to share with the paying 
punters.’

The Cheltenham Festival is not the 
only racing event to have come under scrutiny in recent years. Five 
horses were killed at last year’s Grand National meeting – the highest 
death toll since 1997.

The BBC was criticised for ‘barely 
mentioning’ the deaths,  ‘concealing’ the grim reality of horse-racing 
and presenting a ‘dishonest, sanitised picture’ of the sport to boost 
overseas sales of the footage.

At the time, the Corporation denied 
taking part in any ‘cover-up’ and said its presenters always gave an 
update on the condition of horses injured in a race.
