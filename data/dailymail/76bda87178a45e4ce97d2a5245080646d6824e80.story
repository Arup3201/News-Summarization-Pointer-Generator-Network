Bolton goalkeeper Adam Bogdan produced a fabulous display at Anfield and his timing could barely have been better. 

Liverpool are one of the clubs monitoring Bogdan’s situation aware that he is out of contract at the end of the season and resisting Bolton’s efforts to re-sign.

The 27-year-old Hungarian was making only his second appearance since August – Andy Lonergan has been preferred – and he responded with an array of brilliant saves to frustrate Liverpool and secure a lucrative replay for the Championship club.

He has now kept clean sheets in two FA Cup ties, which will alert more clubs to his availability on a free transfer in the summer. Several Bundesliga teams have been on his trail, with scouts in the crowd at Anfield.

Bolton rejected a bid of £1.2million last summer from Mainz, who are still keen to sign Bogdan. 

Stuttgart and Hannover are also watching him, and there is interest from clubs in the Barclays Premier League although, after this season on the fringes at Bolton, he will not be keen on more time on the bench as a back-up goalkeeper.
