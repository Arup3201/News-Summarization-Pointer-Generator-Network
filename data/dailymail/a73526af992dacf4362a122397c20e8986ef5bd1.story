An Oklahoma man has been charged with first-degree murder after allegedly killing a man who commented on a picture his girlfriend posted of herself on Facebook.

Police say Antwion Courtez Martin, 20, went to the apartment of Edmond James Tyree, 48, on July 17 and shot him dead. He also allegedly shot and wounded Tyree's visiting friend Michael Joe Hale.

Five days before his death, Tyree had written 'damm' [sic] on a picture Sharda Perkins, 21, had posted of herself clad in a skimpy swimsuit on her Facebook page, presumably intended as a compliment.

Below Tyree's comment, Martin, whose Facebook moniker is 'Twon Goinsteady Martin' questioned Tyree on the compliment, using an obscenity.

On July 17, Tyree was shot dead in his apartment by a gunman and Hale, a disabled Iraq war veteran, was shot and injured.

According to NewsOK, Hale said the shooter was accompanied by one or two accomplices, one of whom urged him on, saying, 'What's taking so long? Hurry up and pop a cap in his ass.'

War of words: Unbelievably, police say Tyree's misspelled 'Damn' on Perkins' picture so enraged Martin that he shot him dead five days after the comment was made

Police say Hale was able to positively identify Martin through Facebook while he lay injured in hospital.

According to NewsOK, Tyree had shown Hale a picture of Perkins on Facebook and told him that they had 'been together' once but had both agreed it was a mistake.

'He had mentioned to me a couple of weeks prior that they had been together. They both agreed it was a mistake... but everything's cool. They were still friends and left it at that. That's what he told me,' Hale said.

When he looked at Tyree's Facebook page, he noticed that Perkins was one of only a few friends Tyree had on Facebook. When he clicked on Perkins' profile, he saw pictures of her with Martin and recognized him as the shooter.

'It was pure dumb luck that he had his picture on her Facebook page,' Hale told NewOK.

Police are still looking for the accomplices in the July 17 shooting.

According to Perkins' Facebook page, she has been dating Martin since April this year.

In a July 25 posting, somewhat ironically above a link about the George Zimmerman-Trayvon Martin case entitled, 'Do I even have to explain how messed up this is?', she appears to deny her boyfriend's involvement in the crime.

'Ur face n some serious a** charges for some s**t you didn't even do,' she wrote, adding that she believes Martin will be exonerated and that the couple will be back together soon.

Martin is charged with first-degree murder and shooting with intent to kill. He remains in Oklahoma County jail.
