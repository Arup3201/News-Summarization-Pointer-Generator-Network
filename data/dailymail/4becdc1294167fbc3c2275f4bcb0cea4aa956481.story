Student members of the Melbourne University Liberal Club have been revealed to be behind a series of sexist and racist social media comments that have been branded disturbing by a senior lecturer.

A number of screenshots of the Facebook messages, which were obtained by Fairfax Media, are said to have been made by the group's treasurer and vice president.

Fairfax alleges that in a comment made in January, the group's vice president described a venue as 'worth a visit' before saying the bar had 'lots of sluts', adding: 'get some sluts for me' in another post.

According to Fairfax, the treasurer of the Liberal Club also sent derogatory posts, in which he allegedly said 'Just be careful of those mussrats. A lot of them are [a] bunch of Third World degenerate c***s.' when referring to Muslim people.

Further comments from the same person describe academic and high-profile feminist Germaine Greer as a 'lying f***ing c*m guzzling slut … and a union member' adding: ''She doesn't believe in God. No kids not married … what do you [e]xpect from a melb uni educated former socialist c***,'.

Dr Lauren Rosewarne, a senior lecturer in the School of Social and Political Sciences at the University of Melbourne, told Daily Mail Australia 'It's distressing that any students would make these comments. This is disturbing.'

Politician often attend events organised by political university clubs, according to Dr Rosewarne, in order to boost membership as well as their own profiles.

'New talent comes from them, so it is a breeding ground for new candidates,' she said.

When asked if she believed the crude comments were damaging to the Liberal Party, Dr Rosewarne said there was some distance between the two groups despite them being heavily involved.

The comments, which also obscenely target academic and high-profile feminist Germaine Greer, are claimed to have been made by the Clubs vice-president and secretary

Dr Lauren Rosewarne, a senior lecturer at the University of Melbourne, called the comments 'disturbing' and said the clubs are 'breeding grounds' for new party candidates

'Because it's not a liberal party candidate or a member of parliament, the Liberal Party head office gets to put a distance between itself and the university club,' Dr Rosewarne said.

'Although it does have affiliations with the university club, it's unrealistic to expect them to be able to control what their party members – rather than their candidates - say or do, or even when students go rogue on social media.

'But they can disendorse the club.'

She added: 'Even candidates themselves can't be controlled on social media – that's why they have media teams and press releases.'

The comments come only a few days after the resignation of two Liberal Party candidates, Jack Lyons and Aaron Lane.

Mr Lyons was revealed to have made dozens of racist and sexist posts on social media while Mr Lane was found to have repeatedly used homophobic language on his own social media pages.

Daily Mail approached the Melbourne University Liberal Club's president for a comment but are yet to receive a response.
