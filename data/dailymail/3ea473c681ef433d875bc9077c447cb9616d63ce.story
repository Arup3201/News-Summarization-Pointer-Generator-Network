A former gangster has applied for a licence to hold bare-knuckle boxing bouts in his back garden.

Dave Courtney, 55, has already hosted fights outside his flamboyant home in Plumstead, south east London - which has been dubbed 'Camelot Castle'.

But now he wants Greenwich Council to grant him a temporary event notice for bouts on 10 January.

Self-proclaimed former gangster Dave Countney wants to hold bare-knuckle boxing fights in his back garden

He says the sport (pictured in file photo taken at a campsite in Luton) is 'the most gladiatorial form of combat'

Courtney has previously boasted of his links with the Krays and cultivated a reputation for using a knuckle duster when debt-collecting.

His 100-capacity event is due to take place in his back garden and adjoining alleyway.

The application comes after news surfaced earlier this year that organised bare knuckle fights were already taking place at the property.

But his application for the latest round of boxing bouts has been objected to by a number of organisations, including the police.

In a report into the application, Greenwich Police's Simon Henderson wrote : 'Mr Courtney has provided no information as to how the event is going to be run and controlled.

'Mr Courtney has failed to provide information as to how he is going to protect the safety of the guests attending or of the competitors taking part and also how he is going to prevent nuisance to his surrounding neighbours.'

Sally Lang from the council's licensing department also raised a long list of concerns, from medical provision that will be provided, to lighting and the proximity of a neurological unit for head injuries.

She concluded: 'Boxing is a dangerous sport and I do not consider that a residential premises is a suitable venue to hold such an event.'

It is believed Mr Courtney has previously hosted fights in his garden but has now applied for a council licence

But council officers say his flamboyant home - dubbed 'Camelot Castle' - is not suitable for hosting the event

Mr Courtney has said the fights are well organised and do not cause trouble.

Speaking earlier this year, he said: 'In the old days, the crowd would have been 90% villains. Tensions ran high because there was a lot of money at stake and each firm wanted to keep their rep.

'But today it’s all about the glory. Look for yourself – there’s no security, there’s no trouble here. It’s a lot more civilised.' 

Mr Courtney claims to have had friendships with legendary underworld figures including the Krays and Lenny McLean in a criminal career which he says saw him shot, stabbed and have his nose bitten off.

In recent years he has become an author and organiser of bare knuckle fights around the country. His latest application is in the name of David Courtney OBE - standing for 'One Big Ego'.

In 2011, his stepson Genson Courtney was shot dead in Greenwich following a feud with uncle David Pinto - later jailed for life over the murder. A licensing committee will discuss the boxing event on January 6.
