Homeowners in one Ohio town have found themselves living a real life American horror story.

Thanks to an urban legend that claims the 'portal to hell' is located near some obscure storm drains in Blue Ash, Ohio, scores of feisty teens, horror fanatics, and folks who just like a good old scare flock there in scores, especially come Halloween.

The problem is, this 'portal' is located on private property, and all the commotion is a major nuisance for the homeowners who actually own said property.

To God's chamber: Some believe that the portal to hell (above) is located in a storm drain in Blue Ash, Ohio

Wet entrance: Unfortunately for some homeowners, that 'portal' is also on their private property, where scores of people flock to check out the urban legend

'It’s rough on the homeowners,' Blue Ash Police Lt. Steve Schuelertold WCPO.

'People park in their driveway and try to get into the drainage system and nobody likes that. (The owner) has had to chase off some people, for sure.'

The folklore surrounding the site dates back a few decades, to when some claim that those who worship the man down below practiced their religion in the area.

'A group of Satanists supposedly used to meet there in some type of altar room and conduct their rituals,' says Creepy Cincinnati blogger Rick Fenbers.

'They must have been pretty good, because the legend claims they managed to open a doorway to hell.'

Watch your step: People sometimes park in the property owners driveways to explore, which is a nuisance

As a result, people report hearing screams, seeing floating faces and having contact with apparitions when around this spooky setting.

It even got a seal of approval from ghost hunter and filmmaker David Scott, who filmed a visit to the site and called it, 'one of the scariest locations [he had] ever investigated.'

Weird noises: The strange sounds heard could be chalked up to the various tunnels located underground and echoes

Light at the end: Some warn that a serious storm could cause visitors to drown in the storm pipes

So for anyone looking for a fright, or to glimpse a possible 'portal to hell,' this sounds like just the place - just make sure to keep down the noise out of respect for the neighbors.

Or wait until Ryan Murphy uses this as the inspiration for an upcoming season of American Horror Story.
