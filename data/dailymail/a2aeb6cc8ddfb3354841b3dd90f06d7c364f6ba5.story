Two men are accused of handling £100,000 taken from women who were snared by an 'elaborate and cruel' dating scam and a separate swindle that promised large fake lottery wins.

Sufyan Yesufu, of Bristol, allegedly received more than £7,000 belonging to a woman taken in by a fraudster she met on dating website eHarmony who was persuaded to send money to Nigerian bank accounts. 

He is also accused of handling tens of thousands of pounds from two American women who were duped by the promise of a fake lottery win.

Samuel Hukporti, of Sheffield, is also said to have received cash from one of the victims. 

They are both accused of handling money which had been obtained by 'elaborate and cruel deceptions' by the promise of love or great wealth.

Two men are on trial at the Old Bailey accused of handling and receiving money obtained from women who were duped in three separate frauds - one involving an online dating swindle and the other a lottery scam

Neither man is accused of carrying out the three separate frauds directly but are thought to have been part of 'various arrangements made to receive, distribute and spend' the money.

Denise Richards, from Australia, was the victim of the first fraud.

Ms Richards was 56 when she struck up an online romance with ‘Charles Carroll’ on dating website eHarmony.

‘They corresponded by email at first and then they started to speak over the telephone,’ Thomas Payne, prosecuting, told the Old Bailey.

‘Ms Richards was totally taken in by Charles and she told him on numerous occasions that she loved him.

‘Charles emphasised to Ms Richards that he was a wealthy man and was working in London for an oil company and was owed approximately $2.5m for work he was doing for them.’

But 'Charles' soon started demanding money, saying he needed a $6,000 for a barrister to help retrieve his unpaid wages and $12,000 for an ‘access code’ to his bank account.

Ms Richards, who lived in New South Wales, was asked to send thousands to four men in Nigeria.

‘Among the people who received money from Ms Richards was the defendant Mr Yesufu,’ said Mr Payne, who told the court she sent the equivalent of £7,611.60 to him.

A laptop seized from Yesufu’s Bristol home had photographs of paperwork from the transfer, the jury was told. 

One of the women, of Australia, was duped by a man she met through online dating website eHarmony  

The other two cases concern a fake lottery scam, where two women were duped to send over cash to release large sums of money they had supposedly won. 

Adelle Allen, of California, received a letter ‘out of the blue’ saying she had won $715,810 in the Spanish National Lottery.

Excited at the prospect of the win, Ms Allen started pouring thousands of dollars into releasing the promised winnings, which she was told increased to over a million dollars, jurors heard.

Yesufu is said to have received £71,094.03 in money transfers made between 4 October 2006 and 17 May 2007. Hukporti claimed £14,284.53 on 23 October 2007 from the victim, jurors heard.

The cash was deposited into bank accounts with little to no cash in them and spent or withdrawn rapidly after the transfers, the court heard.

Mr Payne added: ‘In fact she hadn’t won anything at all, this was just a cruel ruse to trick her into handing over money...

‘The fact is that poor Ms Allen was taken in by it and, in the hope of claiming her winnings, she parted with a substantial sum of her own money and all for nothing.’

He added: ‘In this case the defence do not dispute that the sums Ms Allen was tricked into handing over are criminal property because they were the proceeds of a fraud.’

Grace James, of Virginia, was also fooled into sending thousands to Yesufu, the court heard.

Ms James received an email informing her she had won £4.5m in the National Lottery and was instructed to set up a bank account to receive her winnings, sending thousands overseas to unlock her prize, including £25,000 to Yesufu.

Mr Payne added: ‘A sad and familiar picture emerges.

‘She took out loans to raise the money and has been left in a parlous financial position.'  

Mr Payne said the case concerns three separate frauds where people were duped into sending large sums which were transferred to bank accounts controlled by different people, including Hukporti and Yesufu.

He added: ‘In each case the defendants were the recipients of sums of money obtained from people who were the victims of elaborate and cruel deceptions.

‘The victims were snared by promises of great wealth or love and were induced to part with huge sums of money.'  

Yesufu, of Bristol denies three counts of acquiring criminal property and a single charge of entering into a money laundering arrangement.

Hukporti, of Sheffield, denied a single count of acquiring criminal property.
