The BBC’s sacking of a veteran DJ after he accidentally played a song featuring the N-word has had such an impact on his health that he may not work in radio again, it emerged yesterday.

David Lowe, 67, has a condition known as a dystonic tremor which he says has worsened significantly since he was punished for broadcasting a 1930s recording of The Sun Has Got His Hat On.

The corporation was forced to apologise to the presenter for its poor handling of the situation and offered him his job back.

David Lowe (pictured with his wife Jenny), 67, has a condition known as a dystonic tremor which he says has worsened significantly since he was punished for broadcasting a 1930s recording of The Sun Has Got His Hat On

But Mr Lowe, who had been with the BBC for 32 years, said he could not accept what he called the ‘magnanimous gesture’ because his condition – which is rooted in the central nervous system – had deteriorated through stress.

Mr Lowe lost his job after he played a recording of the song by Ambrose & His Orchestra on his Sunday night show on Radio Devon. The version includes the line: ‘He’s been tanning n****** out in Timbuktu, now he’s coming to do the same to you.’

The programme, for which Mr Lowe was paid £5,000 a year, had an estimated audience of tens of thousands. It is understood that only one person complained and that Mr Lowe, who was unaware the word was in the lyrics, planned to apologise to listeners on his next programme.

However he was prevented from doing so by bosses who asked him to ‘fall on his sword’.

The sacking came shortly after Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson received a telling off from BBC executives after unbroadcast footage emerged of him apparently mumbling the word.

Yesterday Mr Lowe, who lives with his wife Jenny, 69, in Torquay, said his poor health means he had ‘respectfully declined’ to go back to his old job.

He told the Daily Mail: ‘When I’m faced with unexpected stress, this exacerbates the condition.

‘It will take me a long time to get back to the way I was before all of this blew up, so I really must put my health first.’

He said he had been ‘compelled to pay the ultimate price’ for falling foul of ‘today’s unforgiving obsession with political correctness’.

Mrs Lowe said: ‘The tremor affects David’s upper body, his head, his eyes, and his hands. It has got worse since this all happened.’

The BBC said: ‘We accept that the discussion with David Lowe about his future could have been handled better.’

Mr Lowe said he had received messages of support from across the world. And former Radio Devon manager Roy Corlett said: ‘It was an accident and for someone to lose their job is disgraceful.’
