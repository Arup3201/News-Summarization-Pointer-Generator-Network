Chelsea will head into Christmas top of the league for the fourth time since the Premier League began in 1992.

Goals from John Terry and Cesc Fabregas were enough to secure  a win at Stoke on Monday night as they restored their three-point gap over title rivals Manchester City.

As a result Jose Mourinho is now top of the tree at Christmas for the eighth time during his managerial career - and seven of those times he went on to win the league.

Two of these came early on during Mourinho's first spell at Stamford Bridge, as they won back-to-back titles in 2005 and 2006.

The Blues were also top of the pile come December 25 in the 2009-10 campaign, going on to lift the Premier League under the guidance of now Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti.

Speaking after his side's 2-0 win against Mark Hughes' men, the Chelsea boss rejected talk that the past will play a part in his team's title bid this season.

Mourinho told Sky Sports: 'I don't think it's important what you did in past. It is this season though.

'In my opinion we were the best today because we're top. We start this period with the hardest set of fixtures - three away and at home to West Ham - who are playing well.'

In the 22 Premier League seasons before now, the team that has been top of the table come Christmas Day has only gone on to win the league on 10 occasions.

However, seven of those have occurred in the last decade - which will give Blues fans renewed hope that history can be repeated.

Most recently Liverpool were flying high two points clear at the top this time last year, but went on to fall at the final hurdle towards the end of the season.

One side which suffered a big slide down the table after being top of the pile at Christmas were Aston Villa - as they ended up finishing sixth at the end of the 1998-99 season - which included a run of just two wins in 15 league games.

But with just one defeat in the Premier League so far this season, the current Chelsea side are extremely unlikely to suffer similar fate, as they look for their first Premier League crown in five years.
