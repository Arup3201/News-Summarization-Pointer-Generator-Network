He is one of the world's wealthiest men, with £11.6bn to his name.

But given that Mark Zuckerberg could comfortably hire an entire Caribbean island with staff for his honeymoon with new wife Priscilla Chan, it's all the more endearing that the two have chosen to spend it in low-key style in Italy.

The couple's Italian adventure continued last night with a simple evening stroll in a picturesque village on the Amalfi Coast in Southern Italy.

Meandering hand-in-hand down gently lit cobbled roads, soaking up the atmosphere, the two proved that sometimes it's the simplest things - and those that come free - that provide the most pleasure.

With their coordinated monochrome style - he in a black blazer and white shirt (the hooded top left back at the hotel), she in white lace dress and dark blazer - the two looked the epitome of Continental chic.

The couple have travelled to the picturesque part of Southern Italy - a part of the country so beautiful it has been declared a World Heritage Site - from Rome, where they have spent the past few days sight-seeing.

Yesterday the newlyweds were spotted brushing up on some Italian architecture as they toured the Sistine Chapel.

A fellow tourist snapped the Facebook CEO as he wandered around the chapel in the Vatican with a priest and tour guide, occasionally placing an affectionate hand on his new bride's back.

The photo of Mr and Mrs Zuckerberg taking in Michelangelo's frescoes was just one many sightings across the Italian capital of the notoriously private social network founder.

Polish tourist Darek Rusajczyk posted the image to Twitter after spotting the social network billionaire and his wife, who is training to become a doctor.

The couple were dressed casually, with Zuckerberg in his typical jeans and T-shirt (but missing a hoodie) while Priscilla wore bright red skinny jeans and wraparound cardigan.

Zuckerberg and his wife listened intently to a guide explaining the marvels of the stunning 500-year-old paintings that adorn the walls and ceilings.

Eschewing glitzy restaurants and stiff luxury dining, the two opted for a meal at a Kosher restaurant called Nonna Betta in Rome's Jewish Ghetto where they enjoyed a simple Italian meal of fried pumpkin flowers and ravioli in an artichoke sauce.

Their bill, which was immediately posted online, revealed that the two sipped tea and water, and paid just 32 euros for their feast - a mere drop in the ocean of Zuckerberg's fortune.

Within minutes of leaving the restaurant, the owner Umberto Pavoncello had confirmed the couple had paid a visit - while word also quickly spread via social networking sites.

Mr Pavoncello said: 'They seemed like two lovebirds. They shared a plate of artichoke ravioli in the centre of the table. It was a very romantic scene.'

The couple were also seen at the Colosseum, the Trevi Fountain and the Spanish Steps, where they took dozens of photographs, before Zuckerberg took his new wife for dinner at Pierluigi restaurant, an institution in the Eternal City since 1938.

Staff revealed the two dined out on a supper of prawns Catalan style, oysters and fish carpaccio, followed by lobster pasta and flame grilled fish washed down with a bottle of Chardonnay Gaia e Rei.

Receipt: He may have billions in the bank, but the Facebook CEO shared a bargain meal with his wife

Unlike Nonna Betta, staff at Pierluigi were rather more reluctant to reveal the cost of their dinner but it was thought to be in excess of £120 - service not included - with a waiter saying: 'It was just the two of them.

'They were happy and content. They had an intimate and romantic dinner.'

The couple are thought to have arrived in Rome by private jet and stayed at the luxury five star Portrait suites hotel close to the Spanish Steps which is owned by the family of fashion designer Salvatore Ferragamo. Prices for the upmarket hotel starting at 800 euros a night.

Zuckerberg and his new bride had a sumptuous suite overlooking the Trinita dei Monti, the church at the top of the Spanish Steps and enjoyed breakfast in their room every morning before being taken around the city in a chauffeur-driven limousine.

On its website the hotel writes: 'Delight in the ‘Dolce Vita’ at the breathtaking Portrait Suites in Rome in the heart of Via Condotti, a stone throw away from the Spanish Steps.'

True love: Priscilla Chan, the new Mrs Mark Zuckerberg, was walked down the aisle two weeks ago by the couple's dog Beast, a Hungarian sheepdog. The couple also wrote their own vows
