Debunking the stereotype of the dumb beauty queen, one pageant winner has manged to prove herself off stage as well as on.

As last year's Miss Birmingham Rachael Barker impressed so much in the role that she now works full-time for the organisers of Miss England.

The 25-year-old is now in charge of organising the Miss Birmingham, Miss Black Country and Miss Worcestershire competitions.

She was offered the job on stage in April as she handed over her crown to her successor, Katie Stamps.

'They said they'd never had a beauty queen do the job before, previously it was someone from the Miss England organisation,' she said.

'But they said they were really pleased with everything I did in my year in office and thought I'd be perfect for the job.'

Next year's Miss Birmingham is expected to be held in February, but Miss Worcestershire is scheduled for September or October.

And Rachael, a University of Birmingham psychology graduate, is already on the hunt for suitable candidates.

She said: 'Whenever I see a pretty girl I want to tell them: 'Enter my beauty pageant'.

'There's
 still a stigma about beauty pageants - people think it's like it was in
 the 1970s with girls parading in swimsuits and talking about world 
peace.

'But it's changed so much.

'There's no swimsuit round and it's all about raising money for charity and building confidence.'

Rachael, from Quinton, originally entered the Miss Birmingham contest in 2009 and was runner-up.

She turned her attention to her studies before tasting success last year - her last chance before the cut-off age of 24.

Rachael lives with her boyfriend, Tim, who works as a doctor at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital.

'I want as many girls as possible to enter because last year for Miss Birmingham we only had 22 entrants - ideally we need around 40,' she said.

'Anyone can enter as long as they're aged between 17 and 24, live or work in the area, are not married and don't have any children.'
