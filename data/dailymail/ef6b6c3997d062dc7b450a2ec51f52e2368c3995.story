Brazilian great Pele is showing further signs of improvement as he continues his recovery from a kidney condition.

The three-time World Cup winner remains in 'semi-intensive care' at the Albert Einstein Hospital in Sao Paulo.

Pele, 74, was admitted on November 24 after being diagnosed with a urinary tract infection that stemmed from a November 13 operation to remove kidney stones.
