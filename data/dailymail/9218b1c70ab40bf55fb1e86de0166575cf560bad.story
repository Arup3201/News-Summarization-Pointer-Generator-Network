An unfamiliar scent of stability is wafting through the Lancashire air. Following the bedlam of recent years, when a Venky's chicken was a surer bet to last longer than a Venky's football manager, Blackburn Rovers have now staggered into some stability with the forthright Gary Bowyer.

Appointed only 15 months ago in March 2013, Bowyer is, incredibly, the eighth longest-serving manager in the Championship. Under Bowyer, the storm clouds engulfing this club have mellowed into a gentle breeze and for the first time in a long time, optimism abounds ahead of the season opener at home to Cardiff City on Friday evening.

Following this spirited draw against Stoke, Blackburn remain undefeated in five pre-season games and they have not lost a football match since March, ending the last campaign with a 12-match unbeaten run and falling only two points short of a play-off place.

'Stability is crucial,' Bowyer said. 'Now we have to try and improve again. The players here are not happy with finishing eighth. We want to do better.'

Against Stoke, Blackburn, an organised and committed side, demonstrated why supporters are slowly but surely falling back in love with this football club.

It was Rovers that opened the scoring shortly before half-time, as Jordan Rhodes darted in front of Ryan Shawcross to glance a header past Asmir Begovic in the Stoke goal.

In their anxiety to conform to Financial Fair Play regulations, Blackburn's summer transfer window has brought only a small number of loan moves and free transfers. In Rhodes, however, Blackburn possess one of the most clinical strikers in the English game and his new contract may prove to be the most significant movement that Bowyers will make.

Stoke - despite being without a win in pre-season - are a patient and enterprising side under Mark Hughes and they gradually reasserted their foothold on the game, with Bojan, signed from Barcelona, demonstrating his credentials once more with a fine strike from 25 yards that flew past Paul Robinson in the Blackburn goal.

We will soon learn whether he can indeed hack a wet, windy night at the Britannia but in the sunshine at Blackburn, the 23-year-old - who once kept Zlatan Ibrahimovic out of the Barcelona team - was head and shoulders above all those on show.

'He's a quality player,' Hughes smiled. 'It's not just his finishing ability but his ability to pick a pass in tight spaces. Even when there are a lot of bodies around him, he always seems to have time on the ball and that is a reflection of a great player. We will benefit from that, certainly.'Â
