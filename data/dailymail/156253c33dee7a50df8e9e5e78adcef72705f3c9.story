More than two million customers have saved a total of £400 million by switching from the Big Six energy firms to smaller, independent suppliers, figures reveal.

Energy UK, which represents the energy industry, said that the rate at which householders switched from the big firms – EDF, British Gas, E.On, Npower, Scottish Power and SSE – to smaller providers had risen dramatically.

In June last year, 36,876 customers swapped to small suppliers. That soared to 126,979 by November and remains high, with an average of just over 100,000 a month changing by the end of June.

In total, 2.05 million customers now get their energy from smaller firms, saving about £200 a year.

The figures cover electricity switching only, but about 80 per cent of those who swap electricity switch gas, too.

Last autumn, the leading energy companies put their prices up, while Labour leader Ed Miliband pledged to freeze prices for 20 months if elected next year. 

The Government responded by promising to slash bills by loosening environmental levies. These added more than £100 to the annual average dual fuel bill, which stands at £1,346, up from £819 five years ago.

Ann Robinson, director of consumer policy at price comparison website uSwitch.com, said: ‘Small energy providers do benefit from lower costs and lower government levies.

However, companies like First Utility has increased its market share above this and continues to offer the most competitive deals.’

Energy Secretary Ed Davey added: ‘We have almost trebled the number of small suppliers since 2010 and our reforms are making it easier and quicker for people to switch suppliers.’
