Apple has opened a broad new front its intellectual property war by patenting a rectangle with rounded corners.

The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued a patent for the 'ornamental design for a portable display device' to the Cupertino, California-based tech giant this week.

There have been claims in recent years, especially from Samsung, that Apple has sought to patent any conceivable oblong-shaped gadget.

which Apple now has exclusive rights

During the massive lawsuit battle between the two companies, Apple claimed that its rival had copied rounded corners on its own range of phones and tablets - as well as in the icons those devices displayed on screen.

Responding to the allegations, the South Korean firm noted that it was 'unfortunate that patent law can be manipulated to give one company a monopoly over rectangles with rounded corners.'

Well now, with the issue of patent no. D670,286, it appears Apple really has finally been granted intellectual ownership over the shape of objects as diverse tablet computers and slices of cheese.

The D'286 patent granted on Tuesday includes a number of drawings of the original iPad design, with most of the identifying features shown in dashed lines.

The patent description explains that 'broken lines in the Figures show portions of the portable display device which form no part of the claimed design'.

The sole unbroken line in all the figures is the outline of the iPad's flat, rounded oblong front face.

Apple originally filed the patent in December 2010, Wired reports - several months after the first iPad was originally unveiled - but it has only just been granted.

As a design patent, it covers only the device's external appearance, which must by 'ornamental' and serve no practical function.

Apple had originally asserted patent D504,889 against Samsung as part of its lawsuit claiming the smartphone rival had copied the iPhone and iPad design for its Galaxy S and Galaxy Tab devices.

Samsung's Galaxy S3 has become the world's best-selling smartphone model for the last quarter, pushing aside Apple iPhone.

Apple has dominated the chart for more than two years, research firm Strategy Analytics said.

It claims Samsung sold 18 million S3 models in the third quarter, compared with iPhone 4S sales of 16.2 million.

Strong sales of the flagship Galaxy S3 - which comes with a large 4.8 inch touchscreen - helped Samsung post a record $7.3billion operating profit in the July-September quarter.

Apple customers were also believed to be waiting for the release of the iPhone 5, which is expected to propel Apple back to the top spot.

After some to-ing and fro-ing a jury finally ruled that Samsung had not infringed that patent, which was awarded in 2005 and appears to be based on an earlier iPad prototype, but had infringed several others.

Now the new patent appears to give Apple rights over the intellectual property that older patent was ruled not to.

Legal experts have, however, argued that its uncertain whether this new patent would be of any use to the company in court.

Lea Shaver, Associate Professor at Indiana University's McKinney School of Law, told Wired: 'This design patent gives Apple no new advantage, because no one is out there trying to market an iPad lookalike.'

A commenter on arstechnica also explains that design patents are extremely narrow, with competitors having to do their 'level best' to replicate the design to infringe them.

The commenter adds that almost every company with products of a distinctive shape applies for them, from Microsoft for its Xbox to LucasFilm for Yoda.

Nevertheless, with the rectangular shape of the iPad being far from as distinctive as either of those two examples, it does seem that Apple really has patented the rectangle.
