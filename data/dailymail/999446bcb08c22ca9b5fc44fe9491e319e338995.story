Robert Reichl, 50, who died after he was lured onto a rooftop in Sunset Park with the promise of sex

A man tricked onto the top of a four-story building by women who said they would sleep with him was attacked by three men before falling to the ground.

Robert Reichl, 50, from Bay Ridge in Brooklyn, climbed to the top of the building on Fourth Avenue near 47th St in Sunset Park after he was promised sex by two women, police said.

Instead, he was set upon by a group of men who robbed him of $2,000 and sprayed him with mace, causing him to fall backwards off the roof.

Mr Reichl, who worked for his family's real estate business, landed in the rear courtyard of the building and was pronounced dead at the scene following the ambush which occurred shortly after midnight on Wednesday.

His family have told police they had last seen him on Monday, and that he went out on Tuesday to pay some builders for repair work they had done on property owned by the Reichl family.

Police say Mr Reichl was seen drinking with young people on the sidewalk outside the building late that night, and later still went up onto the roof with two women, where he undressed.

They believe the women went through his pockets and stole the cash before running downstairs.Â  Then they believe three men went up to the roof and stole other items from Mr Reichl before one of them sprayed him in the face.

Police have arrested three people in connection with the incident: Ruben Santiago, 23, Glennys Reyes, 23, and Randy Ortiz, 24.

Sources told the New York Daily News that police believe Reyes was one of the women who seduced Mr Reichl onto the building and lifted the money from him pocket.

Investigators believe Santiago sprayed him in the face with the substance believed to be mace, causing him to stumble and fall of the building, while Ortiz was also on the roof.

The third man and second woman are currently being hunted.

Reyes and Ortiz have been charged with grand larceny while Santiago has been charged with second-degree murder and robbery, it was reported.

Mr Reichl did not have a wife or children but is survived by his mother, Mary Reichl, and sister Ingrid Reichl.

Miss Reichl told the New York Times that her brother was planning to go with her and her children to Disney World next month.

She said: 'My children lost their uncle who acted like a father to them.'
