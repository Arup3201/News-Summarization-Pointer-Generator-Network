A string of police blunders meant a psychiatric patient and convicted killer remained free to commit murder.

Just before knifing a woman to death, Nicola Edgington rang 999 four times from a hospital begging to be arrested.

A simple check would have told officers that she had stabbed her mother to death in 2005, but no-one accessed the Police National Computer and a crucial opportunity to section her under the Mental Health Act was missed.

Sentenced: Nicola Edgington, left, has been jailed for 37 years after murdering Sally Hodkin, right, and attempting to murder Kerry Clark in a street attack in south east London in 2011

Three hours later, she stabbed Sally Hodkin, 58, with such force that the accounts manager was almost beheaded.

A second woman, Kerry Clark, 22, managed to fight Edgington off.

Yesterday Mrs Hodkin’s grieving 
husband told of his fury that the 32-year-old was freed to strike again 
in October 2011, six years after killing her mother.

Paul Hodkin said his wife and their 
40-year marriage were ‘wiped out in seconds by someone who should not 
have been on the streets’.

Victims: Mrs Hodkin (left) was in Bexleyheath when she was attacked by Edgington, suffering horrific injuries. Kerry Clark (right) was also attacked by Nicola Edgington in Bexleyheath in October 2011

He is considering legal action after 
the ‘chronic failures’ meant Edgington was allowed to walk out of a 
hospital in Woolwich, South-East London.

The Hodkin family said the tragedy highlighted fears about the treatment of dangerous offenders in the community.

Yesterday a report by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) highlighted serious failings in the case, including:

IPCC commissioner Sarah Green said it 
was of ‘great concern’ that police did not carry out a computer check. 
‘Nicola Edgington had a violent history linked to her mental health 
problems and was evidently aware that she was a threat to others.

‘She made repeated phone calls to 
police asking to be sectioned under the Mental Health Act and warned 
officers in person of the risk she posed to those around her.

‘While our investigation found that no
 police officers or staff breached the code of conduct, it is of great 
concern that no Police National Computer check was carried out which 
would have immediately alerted them to Edgington’s violent history.’

It has also emerged that the Oxleas 
NHS Trust, which recommended Edgington’s release in 2009, has cared for 
12 other patients who went on to kill. Oxleas chief executive Stephen 
Firn said none of the other killings had involved random attacks on 
strangers, and the trust said the numbers were not disproportionately 
high in comparison to other London mental health trusts.

Edgington, a former private school 
pupil, was ordered to be detained indefinitely under the Mental Health 
Act after killing her mother.

But she was released after a 
recommendation for her to be discharged into the community was 
rubber-stamped by the Ministry of Justice. The mother of two spiralled 
into ‘freefall relapse’, and in October 2011, she dialled 999 and told 
police: ‘The last time I was feeling like this, I killed someone. I 
killed my mum.’

She was allowed to walk out of the 
hospital and catch a bus to Bexleyheath, Kent, where she bought a £2 
kitchen Asda knife and launched a terrifying attack on Miss Clark. 
Edgington then stole a 12-inch butcher’s knife and killed Mrs Hodkin.

In the Old Bailey, she was given a 
double life sentence for the murder of Mrs Hodkin, and the attempted 
murder of Miss Clark, and was told she would serve a minimum of 37 
years. The former prostitute and pole dancer had attempted to blame her 
actions on paranoid schizophrenia, and asked the court to accept a 
guilty plea to manslaughter with diminished responsibility.

But prosecutors produced evidence that
 her diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia was wrong and that she should 
be convicted of murder.

Trial judge the Recorder of London 
Brian Barker said: ‘You are manipulative and exceptionally dangerous. 
You made your choice and the fact is these were terrible acts for which 
you must take responsibility.’

When Sally Hodkin left home for the last time, her mind was full of her perfect holiday with her husband Paul (pictured right).

The hard-working couple had enjoyed a week together in Norfolk and had returned to their home in Bexleyheath, Kent, just two days earlier.

Mrs Hodkin left the house early so she could catch up with her work as an accounts manager at a law firm. It was a decision that took her into the path of killer Nicola Edgington, who launched a brutal and unprovoked attack on the grandmother. Yesterday her grieving husband said: ‘My life changed on October 10, 2011. My life fell apart.'

Her family say that they are considering taking legal action over the failure of authorities to take Nicola Edgington off the streets.

In a statement read out on behalf of the family by lawyer Daniel Rubenstein outside court, the family said: 'While we are relieved that a very dangerous woman has been taken off the street, we remain concerned at the very many questions that remain over the actions of the authorities and an alleged failure to treat clearly dangerous people in a secure environment.

'We will be considering further action to get answers in the hope that other families won't have to go through the same appalling experience that they have.'

Sally's widower Paul paid tribute to her. He said: 'The thought of not seeing her, cuddling and kissing her again has destroyed me.

'I never had the chance to say goodbye to my wife that I loved and knew since she was 14.

'Over 40 years of marriage gone, wiped out in seconds by someone that should not have been on the streets.

'Sally was my world. I would pick her up each night, travel home together, cook dinner and talk about the day.'
