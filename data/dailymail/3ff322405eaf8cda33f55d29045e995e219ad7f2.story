A shocking video has revealed the abuse endured by police constable Richard Allen, who was able to remain calm in the face of extreme provocation by a gang of young thugs - who filmed the incident

Pc Allen has been widely praised for his self-control despite being told by the unidentified cameraman to 'jog on you mug', and called a 'little f****** perv'. 

The scale of the threats made to Pc Allen have provided an insight of the vile abuse and threats on-the-beat officers endure on an almost daily basis. 

In the clip, which has gone viral, the unidentified cameraman can be heard shouting: 'You want to watch your back, mate.

'You're in Estover - things happen round here. Bad things, mate. People go walkabouts, mate.

'You're not wanted here. Jog on, you little mug. Get back in your bacon mobile and drive off.

'You're on minimum wage, you little bum. You're working for me.'

He finally is heard calling the officer a 'little f*****g perv'.

But the calm officer simply replies 'ok' throughout the stream of abuse, warns the youth about his language and continues with his job, adding 'I'm going to ask you politely, can you stand on the pavement,' as he walks back to the police patrol car.

Pc Allen said after the search, he and his colleague, a special constable, left the youths to go about their day. No arrests were made.

'I didn't want the situation to escalate when it could potentially turn into a fight between six people,' he said of the video.

'I was with a special constable  who was conducting a search for the first time.

'We knew [the person filming the incident] and so we wanted to visit him another time when there were less people around and things were calmer,' said the officer of six years.

'There was no-one present at the time who was being caused harassment, distress or alarm.

'There were no children or elderly people around so I knew I could visit the person another time.'

After his interlude with the youths, Pc Allen went on to demonstrate the other side of police work when he chased an apprehended an armed robber who had targeted a shop with a knife in an unrelated incident.

A police spokesman said the footage was now being investigated. 

'Unfortunately we have a small minority of people who are abusive to the police and we understand some people will be shocked watching the video and wonder why he wasn't arrested,' he said. 

'An officer has to use their judgement and take account of a number of factors.

'The individual doing the filming is known to police. The officer was aware he was being filmed and that he was being deliberately goaded to react for the benefit of the video.

'I can confirm this incident is subject to a police enquiry and action will be taken against this individual. Just because action isn't taken at the time does not mean it is the end of the matter. 

'Unfortunately I can't comment further on this incident, but it was important to provide some context.' 

The incident occurred in the Estover area of Plymouth (pictured), and the footage was uploaded to Facebook last week
