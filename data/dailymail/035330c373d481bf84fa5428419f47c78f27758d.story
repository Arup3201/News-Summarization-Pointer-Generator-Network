Cycling legend Sir Chris Hoy has struck gold in the property market after selling his luxury home for almost £900,000.

The six-times Olympic gold medallist used the grand barn conversion as a base for his training at the velodrome in Manchester.

Sir Chris, 37, lived at the five-bedroomed property with his lawyer wife Sarra but they decided to sell up last year after he quit competitive cycling.

Sir Chris, and his wife Sarra bought the five-bedroom barn conversion for £765,000 in 2009

The six-time Olympic champion used the luxury property as a base while he was still training competitively in Manchester

Sir Chris Hoy and his wife Sarra made more than £100,000 profit on their Cheshire barn conversion which they have just sold for almost £900,000

The couple bought the former farm building on the Mere Hall estate in Knutsford, Cheshire, for £765,000 in 2009.

Property records show that it has now been sold to an Ian Fenton for £870,000 - giving the cyclist a £105,000 profit.

It is thought Sir Chris, from Edinburgh, could be planning a permanent move back to Scotland but his representatives have refused to confirm this.

The house, just a few hundred yards from a golf resort, includes a reception hall, and open plan drawing room, a dining room and sun room.

It is decked out in wooden panels and also boasts five double bedrooms, three bathrooms, a study, a garage and professionally landscaped gardens.

Among the features in the luxury property are this amazing state-of-the-art kitchen

It also features an amazing open plan living area and plenty of natural light from the massive windows

Sir Chris had previously announced that he would like to return to Scotland after he finished cycling competitively describing Edinburgh as his 'home'

At the time the property was put on the market last November, estate agent Stuart Rushton said: 'It is a very nice house in a much sought after area.

'The house was part of a group of farm buildings which were sold off around 10 years ago and converted into a small development of houses.

'The property is in a leafy suburb and is within good commuting distance of Manchester, it’s very popular.

'The property itself is very well presented and has been finished to a very high specification.”

Speaking last year, Hoy told how his heart was still in his home city despite living down south for more than a decade.

He said: 'Home is Edinburgh, even though I’ve been living in Manchester for 15 years.

'I’ll be back in Edinburgh for the festival this summer because I like stand-up.

'We would love to come back to Scotland eventually.

'The fact I’m no longer training full-time and based in the velodrome means we’re a bit more flexible.'

Sir Chris said since retiring from competitive cycling, 'it was nice to spend some time with Sarra', left

He added: 'It’s just nice to spend time with Sarra, put her first as opposed to cycling for a change.

'It’s a luxury to be able to dedicate yourself wholly to one another.'

Sir Chris won his first Olympic medal in Sydney in 2000 when Team GB finished second in the team sprint.

He claimed his first gold four years later in the kilometre time trial in Athens.

At the 2008 Games in Beijing, he won three golds in the team sprint, keirin and individual sprint.

He was named BBC Sports Personality of the Year in 2008 and was awarded a knighthood in the Queen’s New Year honours list.

Sir Chris won two more golds at London 2012 to overtake Sir Steve Redgrave as the Briton with the most gold medals

A spokesman for Sir Chris declined to comment.
