Tragedy has struck a family for a second time after a three-year-old girl died in a car crash while travelling home from a Christmas gathering near Esk in Queensland's south-east.

Eleven years after losing the toddler's grandparents, Aurora Luder was driving along Gatton Esk Road in Buaraba on Saturday night with parents Amiee and Sam as well as brother, Zachary.

Their car collided with another car travelling in the opposite direction near the intersection of Buaraba Creek Road.  

The three-year-old girl died at the scene while her parents and brother were airlifted to hospital with serious injuries, according to police.

Sam, 25, suffered bruising, cuts and fractures to his face - including his cheek, bone and eye socket.

While Amiee, 25, has a broken right arm and bruises, and Zachary, 4, has a broken collarbone.

A relative - who did not want to be named - told Daily Mail Australia the family were having a tough time.

'You just need to understand how hard this is for us as now Aurora is with her nan and pop who were taken in a car accident 11 years ago,' she said.

The family were travelling back to their home in Esk when they collided with another car near the intersection of Buaraba Creek Road

The family lived in Esk and the accident took place just south of the regional town in south-east Queensland

'There was a meteor shower last night and that Aurora was shining through the shooting stars.'

Aurora's death has also come barely two weeks before her brother's fifth birthday on Boxing Day.

To help the family through this difficult time, a fundraising page has been started up by Aurora's aunt, Sheridan Luder, and family friend Rachelle Torrens.

On the gofundme page, Aurora is described as 'a bright spark that lit up the room wherever she went'.

Her vivacious nature was responsible for the fundraising campaign's namesake, which reflected Aurora being 'a bright star in life, but now a bright star in the sky, shining forever for her family'.

'Whether it was riding motorbikes with her dad and Zach, or holding her baby cousin Axel, beneath that tomboy exterior was a gentle, loving and caring little girl who would always look out for those she loved,' it said.

The toddler was also looking forward to starting kindergarten next year.

'She was actually more excited to start kindy than she was about Christmas,' the page said.

'That zest for life certainly rubbed off on anyone she would meet.'

The money raised will be used to help the Luders and to give back to a family who have had a long history of generosity.

'There will be many ways to help in the long run, and we know times are going to be hard for them,' the website said.

'But if everyone joins together and donates something, whether $1 or $1 million, any donation will be appreciated. So please donate and help make this family smile again. 

'Please accept our heartfelt thanks for all of your contributions.'
