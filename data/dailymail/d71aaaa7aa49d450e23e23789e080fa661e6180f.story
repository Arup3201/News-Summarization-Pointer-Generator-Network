David Cameron is ready to take Spain to the European courts over 'totally disproportionate' checks at the border with Gibraltar.

Government lawyers are now examining whether Madrid has broken the law on a right to free movement in the EU, Downing Street said. 

The dramatic threat of legal action comes as British warships set sail for Gibraltar today in a show of naval strength.

Legal action: David Cameron, pictured today on a visit to Watford, is threatening Spanish PM Mariano Rajoy with
legal action over 'politically-motivated' delays at the Spain-Gibraltar
border

Three ships including the frigate HMS 
Westminster depart for Gibraltar today, with ministers boasting it will 
demonstrate the Royal Navy’s ‘formidable strength’.

Madrid
has imposed draconian border controls and suggested that a £43 fee 
could be imposed on every vehicle entering or leaving the outpost 
through Gibraltar’s fenced border with Spain.

It
came after the British territory began work on a concrete reef in the 
Mediterranean which Spain claims will destroy fishing in the area.

Mr Cameron warned his Spanish counterpart Mariano Rajoy last week that the draconian checks had to end.

But
there was a repeat of long delays at the weekend, with the Royal 
Gibraltar Police yesterday tweeted that Guardia Civil checks had caused 
queues of up to two hours at the border, with Spanish officers checking 
'every car' going onto the Rock.

Today
the Prime Minister's spokesman said: 'We feel that these ongoing border
delays as a result of these border checks are politically-motivated and
totally disproportionate.

'We are now considering what legal action is open to us.'

The government believes the controls could be illegal under EU law, contrary to the right to free movement.

'This would be an unprecedented step so we want to consider it carefully before making a decision to pursue, but the Prime Minister is disappointed by what's happened over the weekend,' the spokesman added.

'If we go down this route then we will certainly press the European Union to pursue the case as a matter of urgency.

'We will continue to reiterate to the Spanish our position that they need to de-escalate the issue on border checks.'

The European Commission is warning Spain it must ensure 'smooth and efficient border crossings' including following rules set out in the Free Movement Directive and the Schengen Borders Code.

A source said: 'The Commission is of course following the situation on the ground and is in contact at technical level with its Spanish counterparts in order to organise jointly a visit on the spot, foreseen for the month of September.'

London Mayor Boris Johnson said he 
hoped that it was not just a coincidence that Britain was sending a ﬂeet
of warships to Gibraltar. ‘I hope that one way or another we will 
shortly prise Spanish hands off the throat of our colony,’ he wrote in 
the Daily Telegraph.

He added: ‘The Spanish authorities 
have decided, for no good reason, to revive the border checks and 
general harassment of the Franco epoch.

‘They
are causing delay and botheration and they are now threatening a tax on
goods vehicles going to the Rock. That is illegal under EU law, and 
tantamount to a blockade. They must stop it all, and pronto.’

As
diplomatic relations between Britain and Spain were plunged into the 
deep freeze, the Ministry of Defence announced details of the naval 
deployment to the region, called Cougar ’13.

HMS
Westminster and support ships RFA Lyme Bay and RFA Mounts Bay will dock
at Gibraltar as part of the annual exercise involving 10 vessels 
including the aircraft  carrier Illustrious, two frigates and support 
ships.

In response, Spanish Prime Minister Mr Rajoy vowed to do everything to 'defend' his country's interests.

Tensions between Spain and Britain over Gibraltar have increased in recent days

Now it has emerged that Spain will seek to take its dispute with the UK over Gibraltar to the UN with the support of Argentina.

Spanish
foreign minister Jose Garcia-Margallo is expected to propose that both 
countries present a ‘united front’ over Gibraltar and the Falkland 
Islands, El Pais reported.

Mr
Garcia-Margallo will sound out his Argentinian counterpart, Hector 
Timerman, during a meeting in Buenos Aires next month as he prepares for
a ‘180 degree turn in policy towards the colony’.

Argentina is on a two-year term as non-permanent member of the UN's Security Council and could potentially use its position to include discussions over Gibraltar on the agenda.

Appeal: David Cameron asked the Spanish Prime Minister to scale back contentious border checks with the British territory, including blocking flights to Gibraltar

Spain is also considering the possibility of raising the matter of Gibraltar at the UN's General Assembly or the International Court of Justice at The Hague.

But the UK Foreign Office was adamant that both the Falklands and Gibraltar would remain British while their people wanted to.

A spokeswoman said: ‘Our policy on Gibraltar has not changed and is consistent with our policy on other overseas territories.

‘Self-determination matters more than territorial integrity. ‘The people of Gibraltar have repeatedly and overwhelmingly expressed their wish to remain under British sovereignty.’
