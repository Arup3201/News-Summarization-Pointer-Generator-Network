The father of the 23-year-old Indian woman who died after being gang-raped on a bus has paid tribute to his 'fiercely determined' daughter in his first interview since the attack happened.

In an interview with the BBC the day after he scattered his daughter's ashes on the sacred waters of the River Ganges, her father revealed how his daughter wanted to be a doctor and had promised to lift the family from their poverty.

He said: 'She was very adamant about whatever she wanted.

A protester at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi. The crowds chanted slogans against the government for its perceived inaction in preventing cases of rape and being unable to better protect women in the capital

'When we used to stop at a sweetshop on the way to school she was adamant about wanting a sweet and even the shopkeeper had to relent.

'It was the same in high school. She wanted to be a doctor and said it was only a matter of a few years and that when she was a doctor (all our suffering) it will end.'

'I remember asking her once, who are all your friends? She replied, Dad it's only my books I am friends with.'

Her father moved the family to Delhi from a rural part of India in order to improve her chances of realising her ambition of a career in medicine.

The dream was cut short on December 16 when she was attacked by six men after as she caught the bus home after going to the cinema to watch The Life of Pi. She died from her injuries on Friday.

The event was organized by the Delhi Government, Delhi Commission for Women to pay homage to the 23 year old Delhi gang-rape victim and for women safety

India's people have been outraged by the sickening gang rape attack and have taken to the streets all over the country

The gang rape hearing is expected to begin on Thursday at the Saket district court 
in south New Delhi, where police will formally present a 1,000-page 
charge sheet against Singh and five others accused of raping the victim on December 16.

The sixth suspect is believed to be 17 
years old, meaning he would be tried in a juveniles’ court, but police 
are conducting bone tests to determine his age.

The trial will be held in a fast track court and could be over within a month.

Sanjay Kumar, a lawyer and a member of the Saket District Bar 
Council said that 2,500 advocates registered at the court had decided to stay away to ensure 'speedy justice'.

'We have decided that no lawyer will 
stand up to defend the rape accused as it would be immoral to defend the
case,' he said to AFP.

Criminal lawyer Ajay Digpaul told India Today: 'In my view, it should not take more than 10-15 effective hearings to decide the case it as there is plenty of evidence.'

Fresh details of the case have emerged in the Indian press where it is reported that her attackers tried to throw her under the bus after raping her inside it.

In a show of solidarity with the victim, thousands of Indian women and men took  part in the biggest 
protest yet since they started following the student's death last week.

The protesters carried pro-women slogans to the Mahatma Gandhi memorial, Rajghat, in New Delhi, this morning.

The event was organized by the Delhi Government, Delhi Commission for
Women to pay homage to the 23 year old Delhi gang-rape victim and for 
women safety.

On Monday Indian police arrested a man who tried to blow up the house belonging to the driver of a Delhi bus on which a 23-year-old was gang-raped, as lawyers refuse to defend the accused rapists.

He was found with two homemade bombs outside the house of bus driver Ram Singh in south Delhi's RK Puram area. Two other men escaped arrest.

Anger: Protests continued in Delhi on New Year's Day as it was revealed that the victim was thrown under a bus by her attackers, police sources said

It comes as the Indian government proposed to name a revised anti-rape law after the victim, a move her family referred to as an 'honour'.

The father and brother of the girl said that 'if the government names the revised anti-rape law after her, we have no objection and it would be an honour to her'.

The rape victim died at the weekend after 13-day struggle to survive 
injuries so severe that the majority of her intestines had to be removed.

She
was gang raped and violated with an iron bar on a bus before being thrown from the moving vehicle at the end of a 
40-minute ordeal.

Tense: The body of a young woman who was gang-raped and brutally beaten on a bus in India's capital was cremated but her family say she could have survived

Aware: The body of the tragic student victim was cremated amid tight security, police said

As protests about violence against women grow 
louder in India, a 17-year-old school student has come forward to claim 
she was sedated and raped by two men in the upscale south Delhi colony 
of Safdarjung Enclave on New Year's Eve.

The two men in their late 20s were arrested and sent to Tihar Jail.

The
men, identified as Rajesh and Naveen Jain, work in IT companies, police
said. They were arrested Monday night and sent to Tihar after they were
produced at the Saket court.

The victim had met one of the accused on a social networking site. She
met the man on Dec 31 at a south Delhi market and then asked her to 
accompany him to a flat in Safdarjung Enclave. There he was joined by 
his friend, police sources said.

The two are then said to have 
sedated her and took turns in raping her. They also warned her of dire 
consequences if she revealed anything.

Changes to the government's mentality appear already to be changing in light of the attack.

Politicians facing sexual assault charges may now be suspended from office as the country's highest court prepares to rule on an application to ban regional and national MPs.

Poignant: White lilies could be seen in the back of the ambulance as the body was transported through the city

As part of that 
campaign, Chief Justice Altamas Kabir agreed to hear a petition this 
week from retired government administrator Promilla Shanker asking the 
Supreme Court to suspend all politicians who are facing prosecution for 
crimes against women.

She also asked the 
court to force the national government to fast-track thousands of rape 
cases that have languished in India's notoriously sluggish court system 
for years.

Six state MPs are 
facing rape prosecutions and two national ones are facing charges of 
crimes against women that fall short of rape.

In the past five 
years, political parties across India nominated 260 candidates awaiting 
trial on charges of crimes against women. Parties ran six candidates for
the national parliamentary elections facing such charges.

'We need to 
decriminalise politics and surely a serious effort has to be made to 
stop people who have serious charges of sexual assault against them from
contesting elections," said Zoya Hasan, a political analyst.

Several thousand 
women joined a silent march to Gandhi's memorial in the capital in 
memory of the victim, holding placards demanding "Respect" and 
"Justice." Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit joined the women for a 
prayer session for the victim.

The government has 
set up a task force to monitor women's safety in New Delhi and to review
whether police were properly protecting women. It had set up two 
earlier bodies to look into the handling of the rape case and to suggest
changes in the nation's rape laws.
