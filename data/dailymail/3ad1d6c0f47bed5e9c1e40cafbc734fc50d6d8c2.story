An elderly German man recently indicted on mass murder charges for his time spent at  Auschwitz in WW2 was on duty when Jewish diarist Anne Frank arrived.

Hubert Zafke, now 94, was present when Anne came in on a train carrying 498 men, 442 women and 79 children from Holland's Westerbork concentration camp on September 5, 1944, prosecution documents released at the weekend show.

Anne, whose memoir of a life in hiding from the Nazis became the single most poignant piece of Holocaust literature, was later transferred to the Belsen concentration camp in Germany where she died early in 1945. Only her father would survive the war.

Zafke is now charged in the complicity of 3,681 murders - victims who were gassed or shot when he was on duty. 

Although classed as a medic, such personnel at Auschwitz were not concerned with the health of inmates, but often poured Zyklon-B pesticide crystals into the gas chamber to murder them. More than 1.1 million people, mostly Jews, were liquidated at Auschwitz.

The indictment shows that Zafke, who now lives in the tiny village of Gnevkow north of Berlin, joined the Hitler Youth when he was a teenager in his hometown of Schoenau, which now lies in Poland. 

The son of a farmer, he attended high school and an agricultural college intending to follow in his father's footsteps.

In 1933, aged 13, he joined the Hitler Youth and six years later was in the SS. He received his grounding in concentration camp training at Dachau, the first of the Nazi camps where 36,000 people were murdered during its 12-year operation.

As a junior squad leader - a rank usually given to men singled out as future officer material - Zafke transferred to Auschwitz in the summer of 1944. He is charged with being an accomplice to the murders of the 3,681 victims between August 14 and September 14, 1944.

Prosecutors said: 'He is not charged with any single specific murder but as a functionary in the Nazi murder machine which he enabled.'

Auschwitz was liberated by the Red Army on January 27, 1945, now World Holocaust Day, but Zafke had already gone west and fell into British hands.

He was later transferred back to Poland where he was given a three year jail sentence in 1948 for his membership in the SS and service at Auschwitz.

He returned to Germany, married and had four sons who be brought up in Gnevkow. He made a career out of manufacturing and selling agricultural products including pesticides.

Gnevkow lay in former East Germany. When the wall fell and archives in Poland, East Germany and former Soviet Russia became accessible, he came on to the radar of Nazi hunters.

The verdict against John Demnjanjuk, a former guard at the Sobibor death camp in occupied Poland, in 2011 paved the way for Zafke's prosecution. Demjanjuk was sentenced to five years in jail for his part in the murders of 28,000 Dutch Jews.

It was the first time that there was not specific eyewitness evidence against an individual - the mere fact he was present in the camp was enough for a guilty verdict.

Zafke does not deny his service at Auschwitz but claims: 'I heard nothing, saw nothing, killed no-one.' 

Although he lives alone and cares for himself, his lawyer has already filed a motion seeking to have the charges dropped, claiming he is suffering from dementia.

Christoph Heubner, executive vice president of the International Auschwitz Committee, said: 'For the survivors of Auschwitz this is all about justice, not revenge. Justice has had to wait decades.'

He added: 'Those perpetrators who ensured, as members of the SS, that the Auschwitz-Birkenau death factory worked smoothly, and that the Jewish families of Europe disappeared into the gas chambers, have developed no sense of awareness of wrongdoing over the years.

'Therefore these legal processes are first and foremost an inquiry to the Germans - who actually owns your compassion?'
