They are well known for the bad tempers and aggressive, territorial behaviour.

But now it appears that llamas have become the latest recession-busting weapon in the fight against countryside crime.

The aggressive south American pack animals have long been kept with goats and sheep to guard against predators, but now farmers in the UK are employing them to deter crooks.

Instinctively alert and aware: Llamas have become the latest recession-busting anti-crime measure to be employed by British farmers

A survey by the insurance company NFU Mutual has found they are among some of the more unusual improvised security measures used by its members to keep their valuable property safe.

Thefts cost farmers in the UK 52.7million last year, an annual rise of six per cent, the company has estimated.

Other improvised methods of protecting farm equipment include keeping noisy flocks of geese to alert homeowners of intruders and storing expensive quad bikes in a pen behind a Friesian bull.

But llamas are the most novel means of security the company has identified.

The animals, which are of the same genetic family as the camel, have long been used by farmers in the Americas to defend livestock.

Instinctively alert and aware of their surroundings, llamas draw attention to intruders - human or otherwise - by making a startling alarm call.

If this is insufficient to deter the invader, the animals have been known to give chase, going on the attack with stout kicks and bites. They have, on occasion, even been known to kill predators as big as dogs or coyotes.

There have been no recorded incidents of llamas bringing down UK farm robbers yet, but a survey of NFU branch offices found more that three quarters believed members were more concerned about crime than a year ago.

Farmers have responded by taking more precautions, using CCTV, locks and alarms becoming to secure their possessions - however, such measures are expensive, especially in these straitened times.

The majority of survey respondents (71 per cent) said the bulk of rural thefts were planned, with criminals preferring to operate under the cover of darkness.

The survey also revealed precious supplies such as high-priced power tools, heating oil, red diesel and quad bikes were most likely to be targeted by criminals.

Theft of metal and chemicals has been identified within the survey as growing trends over the last twelve months. Chemicals used for crop spraying can cost more than Â£600 for 10 litres.

NFU Mutual believes chemicals like these are now being targeted by organised gangs who ship them abroad to meet demand across Europe.

Poor economic conditions and rising commodity prices are thought to be behind the surge in rural crime.

Lindsay Sinclair, Group Chief Executive of NFU Mutual, said: 'the countryside has long been seen as an easy target for criminals.

'Encouragingly, country folk are not taking the blight lying down, fighting back with both high-tech security measures as well as more innovative schemes.'
