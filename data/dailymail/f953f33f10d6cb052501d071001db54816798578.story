Sam Allardyce and Harry Redknapp have been in the game long enough to witness shock results. They have seen games and moments of brilliance that endure. This match had none.

West Ham can be pleased with a scrappy yet solid victory and their first clean sheet of the season, taking them to seventh in the table. QPR sank to the bottom, with the worst defensive record in the top flight. They have conceded 15 goals in seven games and demonstrated precious little talent in attack.

For Rob Green, Rio Ferdinand and Bobby Zamora, who all had long spells at Upton Park, it was an unhappy return to their old stamping ground. But no former Hammer was more dissatisfied by QPR’s fifth consecutive away defeat than their manager.

Harry Redknapp has made a few tough calls in his time and he might be tempted to ring the changes at QPR. 

He passed on this message from first-team coach Glenn Hoddle, who was watching from the stands, to his assistant Kevin Bond. QPR did not have West Ham’s number on Sunday...

Harry Redknapp, who spent seven years at West Ham from 1994, lamented the lack of fitness among his team, singling out £10million new boy Sandro, whom he hauled off after an unremarkable 67 minutes.

‘I put a lot of faith in him when I brought him in,’ Redknapp said of the Brazilian midfielder secured from Tottenham. ‘He’s had an injury and we need to get him fit. The doctor told me at half-time that he could only play another five minutes. A few of the players are still not up to speed and peak fitness. People like Jordon Mutch, who I brought in, have not managed to put two games together. It’s a problem for us.’

Asked about Gary Neville’s Sky TV assessment of QPR’s performance as ‘diabolical,’ Redknapp replied: ‘We weren’t great, that’s for sure. It’s his opinion isn’t it? I have seen some diabolical performances of late as well but we won’t go into that one.’

Allardyce’s new signings, meanwhile, have bedded in seemingly without problem. Diafro Sakho, who arrived for £4.5m from French side Metz, got his fifth goal in as many starts. Sakho, who revealed he is driven by the need to provide for his poverty-stricken family in Senegal, showed plenty of desire, patiently waiting to head home a James Tomkins cross.

‘I expected him to spend maybe 10 or 15 games for us finding out about the Premier League,’ said Allardyce, ‘But he is so desperate to do well and his runs are so good. He seems to have the knack of turning up in the right place at the right time. That’s fantastic for him and absolutely outstanding for us. That goes for all the signings.

‘We didn’t really make any defensive errors today. I thought the focus and the concentration was very good.’

Sakho, who had been rejected by QPR, revealed that it was only the intervention of West Ham’s co-chairman David Sullivan that secured his move to Upton Park. He said: ‘I have always wanted to play in England and when West Ham came in for me in the summer, I thought that was it. But then the deal began to fall through as I think the coach was having doubts and I was resigned to returning to France.

‘Fortunately for me, Mr Sullivan stepped in and said he would be signing me and on a permanent deal. It was the chance I needed. I had heard QPR didn’t want me so I wanted to prove I could do it. West Ham gave me the chance and now Mr Allardyce believes in me too.’

West Ham took the lead after five minutes. The resurgent Stewart Downing, Allardyce’s man of the match, whipped the ball over the heads of several white shirts and the flailing arms of Enner Valencia towards the far post. QPR’s Nedum Onuoha, making his first start of the season, angled the ball into the net with his thigh. Green looked dumbstruck, first gesturing for handball then reprimanding his struggling defenders. West Ham missed a plum opportunity to double their lead moments later when Sakho accelerated past Ferdinand and pulled the ball back across the box only for Valencia to poke the ball wide of the post. 

QPR, who haven’t won at Upton Park for 21 years, had only one significant chance in the first half when Charlie Austin made a zipping run into the box, slotting the ball through Tomkins’ legs. Austin ignored the shouts of Niko Kranjcar to pull the ball back, instead blasting it at Adrian, who saved comfortably enough.

QPR were briefly enlivened by the introduction of Zamora at half-time. Within minutes, the 33-year-old, who grew up just a few stops on the Tube from Upton Park, set up Austin with a decent chance and won a free kick.

But West Ham extended their lead after 59 minutes. Mauro Zarate’s volley was blocked and Tomkins collected on the bounce and lobbed over several defenders for Sakho to head home.

There was more drama moments later when Green took a free-kick in the box which was intercepted by Valencia, hovering seven yards away. The Ecuador international buried the ball in the net but the goal was disallowed by referee Anthony Taylor.
