Will Radcliff, who built a multimillion-dollar global business from flavored, icy Slush Puppie drinks, has died at the age of 74.

The businessan passed away in a hospice in Cincinnati, Ohio, yesterday after his health declined following a recent fall, according to his daughter DeeAnn Radcliff Harmon.

His famous drinks, made from frozen syrup and small pellets of ice, have become widely available at convenience stores, shopping outlets and stalls following their creation in 1974.

Today, Ms Radcliff Harmon described her father as a natural salesman with a 'bigger-than-life personality', saying: 'He could sell anything to anybody'.

Radcliff, who once peddled vacuum cleaners door-to-door and earned a six-figure income from selling peanuts, first spotted a slush machine at a 1970 Chicago trade show.

He saw the potential of icy, sweet drinks that could be made for just a few pennies, believing the sound of crystals hitting the cup and the taste of the flavorings would be appealing to consumers.

He came up with the name for his creation - Slush Puppie - with his sister Phyllis as they sat on the front porch of their Cincinnati home.

The brand was later represented by a toboggan-wearing, floppy-eared dog, while initial flavors included cherry, grape, orange and lemon-lime.

As sales boomed, Slush Puppie machines quickly became a staple in many U.S. convenience stores, before distributorships from Australia to Africa made the icy drinks global. 

In 2001, the London-based Cadbury Schweppes PLC bought the Slush Puppie Company. 

Radcliff, who was born Willard Lawson Radcliff in Dayton, Kentucky, also had a frozen cocktail business, among other business operations.

Ms Harmon said her father's first regular job was shining shoes at a country club, and he later kept a vow to return to the club someday as a member.

Radcliff owned a 4,000-acre ranch in Umatilla, Florida, and worked for land conservation amid central Florida's growth, his daughter said. He also had a Lear jet that he piloted himself 'many times'.

Ms Harmon added that her father had many favorite sayings that guided his life, such as 'Where there's a will, there's a way', 'If it ain't fun, to hell with it', and 'Once you break through the clouds, it's always sunny'.

Radcliff is survived by his daughter, son Chris Radcliff, a brother and sister, and four grandchildren.

Mueller Funeral Home of Mason, Ohio, is handling the arrangements.
