Sam Allardyce is adamant that West Ham co-chairman David Sullivan agreed with him that they should sign Andy Carroll over Wilfried Bony in 2013.

The Hammers boss admitted that the club could have signed the 26-year-old Ivory Coast international - who is currently being targeted by Manchester City - for just £8m before he joined Swansea, but instead chose Carroll, whose time at the club has so far been blighted by injury.

Allardyce, however, has denied recent claims by Sullivan that they chose to spend £15m on the English striker instead on his insistence, telling the Evening Standard that it was a joint decision.

Andy Carroll's West Ham career has been largely blighted by injury since his £15m move

'Bony is a player who could have come to us a couple of seasons back.' said Allardyce. 'David Sullivan has said recently that he could have signed him for £8m but that I wanted Andy Carroll.

'My recollection was that, yes, we knew about Bony but we all agreed to go for Carroll — with the caveat that if the deal didn’t work out for any reason, we would switch to Bony.'

West Ham are set to travel to the Liberty Stadium to face Bony's Swansea side on Saturday, although the Ivory Coast striker will be absent on African Nations Cup duty.

The 26-year-old was the Premier League's top goalscorer in 2014, bagging 20 during the calendar year, but Allardyce has insisted he has no regrets over signing Carroll instead.

Sam Allardyce says the decision to sign Andy Carroll over Bony was a joint decision

West Ham co-chairman David Sullivan has said recently that the club signed Carroll on Allardyce's insistence

'Whatever anyone says now, at the time a bid for Bony, unproven in English football, would have represented a bigger risk than Andy, an established Premier League player.

'The likelihood of achieving success, had we signed Bony, was far less than with Carroll. Hindsight is a wonderful thing but, at the time, we were looking at these two possibilities.

'In my experience over more than two decades in football management, you always have to minimise the risk.'
