An Olympic gold medal, comparisons to Michael Phelps and even praise from teen heartthrob Justin Bieber - not a bad way to spend the summer vacation before your senior year of high school.

But Missy Franklin is taking it all in her stride.

After qualifying for a record seven races in women's Olympics swimming events, Franklin has already nabbed a gold and a team bronze - fast propelling her into the hearts of Americans and sports fans.

Despite her amazing feats, Franklin has refused to accept cash prizes or sponsorship deals. Instead she is holding on to her amateur status so she can swim for a college team - when she is old enough.

And her aggressive performances in the water 
could not be further from her gentle demeanor when she climbs out, reverting back to the modest school girl who looks almost surprised to 
be there.

'I dreamed about this moment my whole life,' Franklin gushed after winning the gold medal in  the women's 100-metre backstroke on Monday. 'I finally got one after 17 years!'

Franklin, an only child from Centennial, Colorado,  credits the unwavering support of her parents, D.A. and Dick, for her success.

It was thanks to encouragement from her father, a former senior executive of Reebok who now works for a non-profit environmental company, and his wife that Franklin pursued the sport, she said.

Patriotic: Her parents are Canadian but Missy, dressed in patriotic colours, left, chose to swim for the U.S.

'They have been the best support in 
the whole world,' she told NBC's Today show. 'I know that no matter what I do at any 
meet, if I do my best they are going to be proud of me.'

When Franklin was two years old, she was
 in the sea with her mother when a fish caught her eye and she paddled 
after it - leaving her mother behind in the 12-foot deep water.

And so the love affair began: Home 
movies show Franklin paddling frantically towards her father, barely 
able to keep her head above water - but celebrating with her parents 
when she got there.

This determination torpedoed Franklin to the 2008 United States Olympic Trials when she was just 13, and later to the Pan Pacific Championships as the youngest United States team member at 15.

Early days: She swims with her mother, who says Missy has smiled since the day she was born

At home: Franklin shocked her parents when she swam alone, aged two, and took her to swimming lessons

By 16, she had achieved a world 
record in short-course metres in the 200 backstroke and won five medals,
 including three golds, at the 2011 world championships in Shanghai.

Height 6 ft 1

With such height - the average girl her age is 5 ft 4 - Franklin has less wave drag and is able to glide easier through the water. She can take turns faster as she reaches the wall long before the centre of her body does

Wingspan 6 ft 4

The lengthy measurement from fingertip to fingertip means she can pull her body further

Feet Size 13

Her large feet, which are five sizes larger than the average U.S. woman's, act like flippers through the water

Hands 8 1/2 inches from wrist to fingertip

Like her feet, the large hands act as paddles. With greater surface area, she has more thrust through the pool

Shoulders 18 inches

Her shoulders mean her torso is wider at the top than at her narrow hips, which makes a more streamlined shape through the water

The teen is built for success, with a powerful 6-foot-1 frame, size 13 feet that act as flippers and a 
6-foot-4-inch wingspan.

Her hands measure eight-and-a-half
 inches from her wrist to her longest fingertip, which she uses as a paddle to power her through the water.

It is the frame she hopes can help her win an 
unprecedented seven medals at the Games - one of the reasons she is 
often referred to as the female Michael Phelps.

As her parents are Canadian, they 
offered their daughter the option to swim for Canada, but their daughter
 refused, pointing out the support she has had from her hometown and 
high school.

Franklin manages to squeeze hours of training around her schoolwork, exam prep and social life at Regis Jesuit High School in Aurora, Colorado, but admits it's not always easy.

'Swimming - there's so much energy 
you have to put into it and I want to go to practice and work hard, so 
there's days when I can't stay out late, I can't go out with my 
friends,' she said.

In a recent interview with NBC, she 
burst into giggles over Justin Bieber and boyband One Direction - 
reminding audiences of the Olympian's young age.

And
the admiration is mutual, as Bieber tweeted on Tuesday: 'heard 
@FranklinMissy is a fan of mine. now im a fan of hers too. CONGRATS on 
winning GOLD! #muchlove'

Thankful: Missy, an only child, credits the support of her parents DA and Dick Franklin, for her success

Encouragement: A younger Missy with her parents, who travel with her to competitions across the globe

Normal teen: Missy, who will start her senior year of high school this fall, also manages to maintain a normal life as a teen. Here, she is pictured with her date for her prom earlier this summer

Franklin tweeted in response: 'I just died. Thank you!'

Amid the high pressure of Olympic 
races, high school exams and teen boybands, Franklin has also found time
 to think of others, paying tribute to the victims of the recent 
Colorado shootings.

The
 teen attends school and trains in Aurora - the town where a gunman 
slayed 12 and injured 58 in a shooting spree during a screening of The 
Dark Knight Rises on July 20.

'Every
 single race I’m going to have that in the back of my mind,' she said 
before the Olympics. 'Hopefully, I can make Colorado proud and bring a 
little bit of light there.'

With her all-American image and outstanding performances in the pool, there is a fair buck for the youngster to make.

But although companies are offering lucrative sponsorship deals and the country's top coaches and high-profile agents have been banging at her door for years, Franklin has turned them away.

Bob
 Dorfman, the executive creative director at a San Francisco advertising
 firm, said she may be giving up the chance to make more than $1 million
 in endorsements if her success continues.

'If
 you use Phelps as a gauge and how much he’s made, it’s maybe in the low
 seven figures that she could be leaving on the table,' Dorfman told 
Bloomberg.

She has already given up $115,000 in 
prize money; the U.S. Olympic Committee pays gold medallists $25,000 and
 USA adds a $75,000 bonus. Her bronze would have earned her $15,000.

But Franklin remains firm about turning down the cash in exchange for an amateur career and a place swimming for a college.

'Swimming in college has always been a
 dream of mine,' she said. 'It just seems amazing. I want to be a part of it.'

Famous fan: Singer Justin Bieber tweeted his praise to Missy - who responded: 'I just died! Thankyou!'

Joy: Franklin, pictured on Monday, said she swims because she loves it - not because of the money to be made

Camaraderie: She hugs Australia's Belinda Hocking, right, after they took first and second place in the race

Whether she can maintain such resistance as the races - and hopefully trips to the podium - continue, remains to be seen.

'Right now I'm doing what I love,' she added. 'That's honestly the reason why I'm doing it.'

And that love is paying off. Franklin stunned spectators when minutes after swimming a 200m freestyle semifinal heat, she climbed back in the pool to win gold in the 100m backstroke on Monday.

'I am, so happy, I knew that tonight was 
definitely going to be difficult, with that double, but I had a blast 
tonight,' Franklin said afterwards.

She appeared in disbelief as she was awarded her medal, every emotion dancing in her eyes as the national anthem played.

Teamwork: Missy, right, also took a bronze medal in the women's 4x100-metre freestyle relay on Saturday. She is pictured with, from left, Lia Neal, Allison Schmitt and Jessica Hardy

Advice: She has been called the female Michael Phelps, right, as she is also in line for numerous medals

Smile of a winner: Missy Franklin's next chance at a medal is on Tuesday night in the 200m freestyle swim

'I was trying to sing,' she said. 'But
 I was crying at the same time and I forgot the words because I didn't 
know what I was doing. I was just a huge mess.

'But seeing that flag being raised was so incredibly unbelievable. I could have never dreamed it would feel like that.'

She still has a fair few battles on her hands to achieve her dream of securing seven medals, placing her ahead of Natalie Coughlin, the first U.S. woman to win six medals in one Olympics in Beijing 2008.

Her next shot at a third medal comes at Tuesday night's 200m freestyle swim.

'I know that it's going to be tough,' she said. 'But like Michael [Phelps] said, it's all mental and I think that I'm prepared to do it.'
