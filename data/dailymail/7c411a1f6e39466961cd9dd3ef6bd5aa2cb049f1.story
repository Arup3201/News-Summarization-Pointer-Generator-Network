A scientist who apparently worked in some capacity for Lockheed Martin has claimed aliens on Earth are real and have made contact with Earth in a video posted shortly before his death.

Boyd Bushman apparently drew on his own personal experiences to reveal that extraterrestrials were in Area 51.

And in a bizarre interview he also claims anti-gravity is one of several technologies being hidden by the government. 

In a video Boyd Bushman (shown) says aliens are real and they have visited Earth. He made the claims before he passed away on 7 August 2014. Incidents such as Roswell in 1947 were caused by aliens, he says. And he also shows off 'pictures' of aliens and their home world

The controversial video was apparently made shortly before Mr Bushman died on 7 August 2014.

He had several patents attributed to him that were assigned to Lockheed Martin, and he was apparently also a senior scientist at the company - although that claim is disputed.

These patents include a magnetic drive, an light beam to find objects, a thermally energised electrical power source and a heat radiation detection system.

Mr Bushman says aliens have visited Earth, and continue to do so.

He says they come from a planet called Quintumnia 68 light-years away and can make the journey in 45 minutes.

These aliens have fingers and toes like us and are five feet (1.5 meters) tall.

They are also apparently up to 230 years old - although Mr Bushman didn’t say if he meant a Quintumnian year or a humble Earth year.

And the aliens can even commute through telepathy.

Having visited Earth in their spacecraft, scientists here have apparently been reverse-engineering their UFO technology.

This includes the accidental shooting down of a flying saucer in 1947 – infamously associated with the Roswell incident.

Remarkably, Mr Bushman also says he gave a camera to the aliens to take pictures of their home world – which he shows off in a series of blurry images.

And last but not least the US, Russia and China are also apparently working on anti-gravity technology.

In the video Mr Bush says there are Americans working on UFOs from outer space 24 hours a day, reported the Metro.

He also says aliens hail from a planet 68 light-years away called Quintumnia, but that it takes them just 45 minutes to reach our planet.

‘There are two groups of aliens,’ said Mr Bushman. ‘They divide them into two groups. It’s like a cattle ranch. 

'One group are wranglers, and the others are rustlers - the stealers of cattle.’

Among the other wild claims in the video, he says there is a special flight path to Area 51 from space.

Aliens at the base are apparently five feet (1.5 metres) long and up to 230 years old.

They each have five fingers, which are 30 per cent longer than ours, and five webbed toes.

And the Quintumnians apparently communicate through telepathy.

In yet another bizarre claim, he also says scientists at Area 51 have been working with Russian and Chinese counterparts to develop anti-gravity technology.

His claims, understandably, have been met with widespread criticism and derision.

Speaking to MailOnline, UFO expert Nigel Watson, author of the Haynes UFO Investigations Manual, said: ‘This story has been received with equal measures of enthusiasm, curiosity, confusion and scepticism in the UFO community.

Some commenters have said that the alien Mr Bushman shows in his video looks oddly similar to a plastic one shown in shops (pictured). 'Was Bushman delusional or telling the truth? Certainly, Bushman believed in what he was saying,' said UFO expert Nigel Watson

‘Several people have noted that the alien in the pictures produced by Bushman look very much like an alien doll sold by shops several years ago.

‘Was Bushman delusional or telling the truth? Certainly, Bushman believed in what he was saying.

‘As long ago as 2008 he passed a polygraph test, during which he claimed he had worked on antigravity projects, alien technologies and had even met and photographed an alien, and examined at least eight different types of alien spacecraft.

‘Bushman also revealed that he had received death threats and that security personnel had attempted to discredit him and tried to keep him from talking to the public. ‘

And Alejandro Rojas at website Open Minds said: ‘Like so many stories in the UFO field, Bushman’s is enigmatic.

‘The whole affair could easily be written off as the delusional ramblings of an old man.

‘The only thing that causes one to pause is Bushman’s background. Why would a high level scientist begin making up such wild stories?'

Lockheed Martin was yet to provide a comment on the claims when contacted by MailOnline.
