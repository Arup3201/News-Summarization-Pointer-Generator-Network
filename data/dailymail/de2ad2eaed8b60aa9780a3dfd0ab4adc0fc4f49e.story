A group of friends soaking up the golden Australian sun, laughing as they fish with sticks by a campsite and showing off a shark caught in shallow waters.

These are the stunning images which give a beautiful insight and rare context into Sunbaker, the iconic 1930s photograph which best represented Australia's unique beach culture.

The quintessentially Australian image, snapped my Max Dupain, has been revealed to have come from a collection of 108 other photographic prints from a group camping trip down the New South Wales south coast.

They were put together into an album by Dupain's good friend, architect Chris Vandyke, and hidden away in the dark room at his home for many years.

The Sunbaker: Max Dupain took this iconic image in 1937 though it wasn't published until 1975. There are believed to be around 200 signed prints of the photograph

Now on display for the first time at The State Library of NSW, the 'Vandyke Album' shows an array of photographs taken by Dupain and his then partner Olive Cotton during camping trips to Culburra Beach in 1937.

Beyond the one iconic photograph, the album, donated to the Library by the late Mr Vandyke's son, Tony Vandyke, presents an important record of Australian life in the late 30s, just after the depression.

'Every now and then it would come out at dinner parties and things like that but after my dad died I think we forgot about it for some period of time,' Tony Vandyke said of the album to the Sydney Morning Herald.

'Dad used to talk a little bit about history, he wasn't one that dwelled on the past a lot but there were a couple of stories that he told about those times which were, life was very simple during the depression and I think some of these simple camping trips reflected some of that - and it was always good to have such interesting good friends around.'

Fellow photographer: Olive Cotton's work was also featured in the Vandyke Album

But what astonished the library's curators, was the alternative versions of the famous Sunbaker image that were found in the holiday album, one of which Dupain preferred and had originally chosen for publication.

The extremely rare photo, of which the negative has been long lost, looks identical to the popularised image at a moment's glance, but actually presents the subject in a more realistic way.

The photographs subject, British builder Harold 'Hal' Salvage, holds one hand in a fist and lies somewhat more in proportion to the sky, the surf clearly seen behind him.

The album also reveals alternative shots of Sunbaker, taken from different angles and varying views by Dupain, despite his claims that the shot was spontaneous.

Dupain, who died almost 22 years ago, was known to have resented the undying fame and attention given to Sunbaker, striving to give credit to his other works.

The Other Sunbaker: This version of the image shows Dupain's friend Harold Salvage with his right hand clasped. This is Dupain's favourite version of the photograph though less famous. No copies of this photo exist except the one housed by the State Library of NSW and the negative has been lost
