While there’s nothing that divides opinion as quickly as a caravan, they've been an iconic part of the British landscape for decades – as these previously unseen images show.

Testament to their ever-changing designs and developments, the National Caravan Council has released a collection of pictures of some of the oldest and greatest caravans known to mankind.

The predominantly black and white pictures, which mark the trade body's 75th year, date back to the 19th century and include the world’s oldest  camper which dates back to 1885 and was pulled by two horses. 'The Wanderer' was commissioned by Dr William Stables and designed purely for the pleasure of travel.

Made from mahogany and maple wood, and painted black and gold, former naval officer Dr Stables wanted the life of a gypsy while traveling in style - spawning the nickname ‘Gentleman Gypsy’. The black and white photograph in the collection shows a family enjoying a picnic beside the groundbreaking design.

At the time, it was such a novel product that a valet had to ride ahead on a bicycle and clear the way, moving along other road users.

The Wanderer was restored over ten years leading up to The Caravan Club’s centenary in 2007 when it took centre stage at Buckingham Palace.

Also in the collection, a couple escape the start of the Second World War in their 1939 Eccles caravan and there are examples of caravan parks spanning the last century at beautiful locations throughout the country - from Kent to Scotland.

Each of them paint the perfect picture of travelling holidays, which were once seen as the height of sophistication.

The images include a flyer advertising the first ever International Caravan Exhibition and a colour copy of a 1975 billboard advertising the ideal caravanning holiday.

The pictures come ahead of the Motorhome and Caravan show which opens for the 55th time on October 14 at the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham, West Mids.

At the exhibition, the Eccles President - a 1938/9 vintage caravan - will be on display after being restored.
