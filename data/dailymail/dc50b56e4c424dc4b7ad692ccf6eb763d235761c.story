Historian Mary Beard who was horrifically abused by internet trolls last night revealed she has befriended one of the worst offenders and even gave him a job reference.

The academic and broadcaster has fought a public battle against online abuse - known as trolling - after receiving a torrent of abuse on social media site Twitter.

In July last year, she named and shamed former public schoolboy Oliver Rawlings, 20, for calling her a ‘filthy old slut’ and adding a revolting sexual comment.

At the time, the Cambridge classicist whose approach caused the university student to apologise, offered to take the student ‘out for a drink and smack his bottom’.

And it has now emerged that following the furore over his comments she did exactly that.

Speaking in an interview with the New Yorker magazine, Beard, 59, revealed the pair had remained in touch after he took her to lunch to apologise.

‘He is going to find it hard to get a job, because as soon as you Google his name that is what comes up,’ she said. ‘And although he was a very silly, injudicious, and at that moment not very pleasant young guy, I don’t actually think one tweet should ruin your job prospects.’

She added: ‘In general, I am more concerned to be sure that people don’t use the internet in this way (or don’t do so again) than to seek “punishment”.’

Professor Beard retweeted Rawlings’ original comment to her 47,000 followers to out her abuser, but said she didn’t want him to suffer in the long term for ‘one moment of idiocy’.

At the time, her actions prompted him to write: ‘I sincerely apologise for my trolling. I was wrong and very rude. Hope this can be forgotten and forgiven. I feel this had been a good lesson for me. Thanks 4 showing me the error of my ways.’

Mary Beard said it was not the first time she had intervened to help someone who abused her on the internet

Professor Beard has been one of the most outspoken voices on trolls, condemning their behaviour as ‘vile playground bullying’ and ‘generic, violent misogyny’ after an appearance on BBC Question Time last year led to a torrent of vile sexual taunts and abuse directed at her on social media.

Beard told the New Yorker it was not the first time she had stepped in to help someone who had abused her online. In fact, she revealed she had taken a similarly benevolent approach with another internet abuser who called her evil following her Question Time appearance.

Following an exchange of emails, she discovered the troll was in fact upset about a problem with his healthcare. Beard then stepped in to lend assistance to him.

She said: ‘It took two minutes on Google to discover the reciprocal healthcare agreement, so I sent it to him. Now when I have a bit of internet trouble, I get an email from him saying: “Mary, are you all right? I was worried about you”.’

Professor Beard said she had also received an apology for another man who had doctored an image of her with genitalia on her face.

He revealed himself to be a married father-of-two and had sent her a letter that described ‘how he should never have done it’.

Describing her constructive approach, Professor Beard said she did not simply want to be perceived as a ‘long-suffering female parent’ scolding her errant teenager, adding: ‘If being a decent soul is being maternal, then fine. I’ll call it human.’

On her personal blog, A Don’s Life, which she has kept since 2006, Beard has voiced concerns on the destructive nature of internet trolling, adding: ‘It would be quite enough to put many women off appearing in public, contributing to political debate.’
