A long-running dispute between two brothers over conifers erupted in violence when one of the warring siblings hit the other in the face with a small potted tredd.

Richard Hewson, 68, would not even speak with younger brother Geoffrey, 64, but one day when he spied him planting trees on communal land near his manor house he snapped.

The wealthy retired sales executive picked up one of the juvenile saplings and hit his brother in the face - causing a split lip, cut to his ear and another between his eyebrows.

The squabbling siblings live opposite each other in two beautiful homes in the picturesque Landford Manor, near Salisbury.

Richard bought the manor home and coach 
house in 2003, converting the main building into three separate 
dwellings and sold the other property to Geoffrey.

However they fell out over a series of family issues, including the will of 
their mother, who died in 2004.

The warring pair do not speak despite sharing the same driveway, eventually came to blows on November 19, 2011.

Salisbury Magistrates' Court heard Richard Hewson had been in a long-running dispute about the trees with his brother Geoffrey, who lives in a cottage opposite the manor.

Geoffrey, a retired businessman 
and property developer, admitted he had not discussed his planting plans
with Richard over fears he would become 'confrontational'.

Richard was angry about the trees because he claimed it would restrict access to his drive for his tractor and trailer.

Salisbury Magistrates Court was told that Richard Hewson had discovered Geoffrey had been consulting residents of the manor estate about the trees - without notifying him.

Geoffrey told the court his brother 
approached him when he was planting the trees, picked one up and hit him
in the face with it.

He 
claimed the tree had a stake in the bottom of it which split his lip and
he also suffered a cut to his ear and between his eyebrows.

But Richard denied the allegation and said he had picked up a tree and thrown it in his brother’s direction, but it did not hit him.

He said Geoffrey, who lives with wife Carol, 63, rugby tackled him to the ground and the injuries were caused by gravel as they grappled on the floor.

The pair were eventually pulled apart by a neighbour with both later reporting the incident to the police.

Richard was arrested and refused to accept a police caution with the case going to Salisbury Magistrates who found him guilty of assault.

He was handed a six-month conditional discharge and ordered to pay £300 costs.

Speaking at their beautiful countryside homes in Wiltshire, the two feuding brothers continued their war of words. Geoffrey said his 'ignorant' brother 'thrust' him in the face with one of the trees.

He said: 'I wanted to tidy up the area and asked the community chairman if I could plant the trees. I did it for everyone’s benefit.

'Then, as I was doing it I looked around and I had the tree thrust in my face, putting me on the ground. I know how to defend myself so I kicked his legs away and he came down to my height and we were on the floor.

'I restrained him which isn’t easy when you have a lung infection and a neighbour helped me up. I had a cut lip, cut ear and broke my watch.

'I called the police and they arrived two hours later. The CPS got involved because he refused to take the caution. He should have put his hands up and said he lost his rag.

'It is so sad at his age, he could have easily had a word about it but he didn’t. He’s so ignorant and everyone in the community keeps the same view.'

But Richard firmly stood by his defence, describing the case as a 'serious miscarriage of justice' and claiming locals have ganged up on him and wife Christine, 67, trying to force them out.

He denies hitting him with the tree, instead saying he threw a tree towards his brother with Geoffrey then charging at him before they 'grappled' on the floor.

Richard also claims Geoffrey suffered the injuries as they rolled around the floor like two schoolchildren in a playground.

He also branded Geoffrey 'a liar' and regrets selling the coach house to his brother in the first place.

However, he received a six-month conditional 
discharge and ordered to pay £300 costs after being found guilty of 
assault by magistrates in Salisbury, Wiltshire.

Furious at the verdict, Richard said: 'What they were saying in court is not what was said in their witness statements. I didn’t hit him. I’ve never laid a finger on anybody. My brother is a liar. He’s lied forever.

'His statements to police and as a witness contradicted each other. On the stand he said he had difficulty bending down but he managed to build a low brick wall.

'For me, my whole life has been about honour and trust and as a salesman I used to agree £12 million deals all around the world with the shake of a hand.

'We had a barrister for the case and he was fuming when the magistrate found me guilty. This is a terrible miscarriage of justice.'

Richard’s wife Christine added: 'This has caused us a great sense of wrong and injustice. Richard has never hit me or the children and I cannot believe he would harm anyone other than in self-defence.

'Geoffrey says he feels intimidated and unable to move freely around Landford following the so-called assault. Geoffrey is not the only one to feel intimidated. We have been thoroughly hurt by the whole incident.

'A police officer made the comment to my daughter that perhaps the boys should have their heads knocked together. It should have been left at that.'

Richard, who has now installed CCTV at his property in case any further incidents happen, claimed his brother had got everyone in the area on his side to force him out.

He added: 'They have poisoned us and they all find this very funny. It would be great if everyone got on but the community is now an area of distrust. We’ve been very hurt by this.'

Both brothers have admitted they won’t resolve their differences and continue to avoid each other despite sharing the same driveway.

Geoffrey added: 'He is above his station. He thinks he is the Lord of the Manor. If I was in his position I would leave as I couldn’t live with people not liking me. I just wish he would sell up and move.'
