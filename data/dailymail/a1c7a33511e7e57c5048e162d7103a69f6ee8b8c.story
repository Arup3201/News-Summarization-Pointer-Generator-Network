Devastated: Damien Hirst's partner may have left him for an older man only last month, but the artist put a brave face on his heartache when he was pictured with symbolic artwork today

It was only a few days ago that details had emerged of Damien Hirst's split from his partner of 20 years after she left him for a former mercenary.

But in the face of his relationship breakdown, the world's richest artist has put a brave face on his personal troubles, as he was pictured today going back to the day job and holding a particularly symbolic artwork.

Hirst, who has a £215m fortune, was left devastated last month when Maia Norman, his partner of 19 years, confessed her affair with former Lieutenant Colonel Tim Spicer.

But the 47-year-old artist appeared 
focussed on his work in London's Covent Garden at a Tate Modern Art 
Project today, despite at one point holding up a painting of a giant 
bright red heart.

The details of Hirst's relationship 
breakdown with Norman were revealed on Sunday, after the couple broke 
news of their split to friends and confidants.

In the wake of the revelations, it 
emerged that Hirst went ahead with a party in the grounds of one of his 
country homes only hours after news broke that his partner Maia Norman 
had left him for Mr Tim Spicer.

Fans expressed their sympathy to Hirst
after Miss Norman confirmed she was leaving him after 19 years for 
former soldier-of-fortune Spicer, who is 12 years older than the artist,
who is the father of Norman's three children.

It is unclear whether Norman will now move out of the couple’s main home, a 300-year-old Grade II listed farmhouse in Devon.

A fortnight ago, she grinned as she 
greeted 59-year-old Spicer, a former Lieutenant Colonel in the Scots 
Guards who now runs Aegis Defence Services, a security firm that has won
multi-million-pound contracts with the US government in Iraq and 
Afghanistan.

Details of Hirst's split from Maia Norman emerged last weekend, with the break-up thought to have happened last month

Two weeks ago, California-born Miss 
Norman, 49, was photographed in Hollywood tenderly kissing Spicer in 
front of 150 journalists attending a car rally.

She embraced her lover for a second time before the pair walked arm-in-arm into a hotel lobby.

An onlooker said: ‘They looked 
incredibly comfortable and happy to see each other. You got the feeling 
this was the real thing, not just a fling.’

When approached and asked whether she was leaving Hirst for Spicer, Miss Norman said ‘yes’ before declining to speak further.

Divorced Spicer, the father of a 
teenage son, remained silent, although yesterday a spokesman confirmed 
he did not deny the story.

Spicer, 59, is a former Lieutenant 
Colonel in the Scots Guards and a Falklands veteran. He came to 
prominence through his company Sandline during the ‘arms-to-Africa’ 
controversy in 1998. He now runs Aegis Defence Services, a security firm
that has won multi-million-pound contracts with the US government in 
Iraq and Afghanistan.

For his part, Leeds-born Hirst is the 
most successful living artist. His controversial works, which include a 
dead shark encased in formaldehyde and a skull made from diamonds, have 
helped him earn what is believed to be a £215million fortune.

One onlooker said: 'They looked incredibly comfortable and happy to see each other. You got the feeling this was the real thing, not just a fling.'

Last night, however, lawyers said Miss
Norman might be entitled to very little of that money because the 
couple – whose children are aged 16, 12 and six – never married.

Ayesha Vardag, of London solicitors 
Vardags, said: ‘They are not married and, in England, the rights of 
cohabitees are extremely limited, even if they have been in a 
relationship for a long time and even if they have three children.

‘It all depends on whether they have a
joint bank account and if her name is on the title deeds of the various
properties. If not, she could be entitled to very little for herself.’

As well as the 300-year-old Grade 
II-listed Devon farmhouse, which is the main family home, Hirst also 
owns a restaurant, a pub and an art studio.

Bond and Hirst bonded over their mutual lack of a father figure and humble beginnings. She initially worked as his assistant. One of Hirst's best-known works is a diamond-studded human skull that sold for £50 million

In 2005, he paid £3million for 
Toddington Manor, a gothic pile in Gloucestershire that he is renovating
to house his art collection, and he also owns a house in Thailand, a 
beach home in Mexico and a houseboat moored on the Thames in Chelsea.

Although they never married, Hirst and
Miss Norman used to refer to each other as husband and wife, and their 
relationship was seen as one of the art world’s most stable.

Sources stressed their main priority now was the welfare of their children.

It is not known how Spicer came to 
know Miss Norman but neighbours in Devon have speculated he could have 
helped to arrange the security guards who monitor the entrance to 
Hirst’s home.
