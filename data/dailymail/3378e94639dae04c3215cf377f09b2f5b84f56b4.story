A driver was found dead in the wreck of his car yesterday after it plunged over a 100ft cliff at a popular seaside resort.

The white hatchback landed on rocks near the waterâ€™s edge. The engine was still running and the windscreen wipers were on when the Coastguard reached the scene in Newquay, Cornwall.

Police are trying to establish whether the death was a suicide or an accident caused by mechanical or driver error.

Rescue: A man has died after his car went off a cliff and landed at the water's edge in Newquay, Cornwall, this morning

The car landed near a lifeboat slipway and a group of caves known as the Tea Caverns.

Residents said the man must have driven through a pay-and-display car park and then off a path in order to reach the spot.

RNLI lifeboats, coastguard teams and four fire engines all helped with the rescue operation.

The white hatchback remained the right way up on its wheels after getting stuck in rocks some distance from the water's edge.

The death is not being treated as suspicious. The police
investigation will consider whether the driver suddenly became unwell 
at the wheel, whether the vehicle had a mechanical failure or if it was a
deliberate act.

Kayaker Russell Sinkevicius, 51, said he had just paddled out of Newquay harbour at around 7am when he spotted the white vehicle on rocks at the water's edge at Gazzle, near Towan Head.

Believing it to have rolled off the cliff the night before, the father-of-one approached the car thinking it must be empty.

But as he moved closer he spotted a 
man hanging from the passenger window, called out to him and then 
immediately dialled 999 when he received no response.

He said: 'It's a bit shocking. No one wants to see anything like that.

'I expected to approach the car and take a photo and the next thing I see is a man hanging outside of it. He looked like he had a lot of facial injuries and the structure of the car was really messed up.'

It is not known exactly when the car plunged from the sheer cliffs and formal identification has not taken place.

The kayaker added: 'The next thing I get over to the car and there's a young lad hanging out the passenger side window.

'The air con sounded like it was still running and the wind screen wipers were going. I shouted to him to try and get a response but there was nothing so I dialled 999 straight away.

'The emergency services arrived very quickly, in about 10 minutes.'

He said paramedics had tried 
unsuccessfully to resuscitate the man while he searched the water, which
was littered with debris from the car.

surrounding the death and a full investigation will be carried out.'

The man died at the scene and his body has been taken to a Truro Hospital.
