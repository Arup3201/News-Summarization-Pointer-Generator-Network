A pig that weighed in at nearly one ton was publicly slaughtered today after its owner won first prize on a competition held by a Taoist temple in Taiwan.

Ten Holy Pigs were force fed to make them grow ten times larger than normal for the contest held by the Sanhsia Tzushih Temple in Yingko, New Taipei City, northern Taiwan.

The winning pig weighed in at a staggering 936kg and appeared in public looking like a porcine equivalent of Star Wars villain Jabba the Hut.

Farmers compete to raise the heaviest pig for the annual event, which culminates with all the animals having their throats cut in public to please the gods.

The temple authorities award the farmer with the fattest pig a prize in gold for his achievement.

The tradition is generations old, but in recent years it has attracted fierce criticism and public protests from advocates of animal rights.

They say the contest is cruel, alleging that the pigs often kept in small enclosures and hit on the snout to force them to keep eating, and have demanded that it is abolished.

Temple officials have previously said that they will phase out the competition by 2017, but this year they said merely that they planned to stop handing out gold prizes to winning owners.

Activists have accused them of paying 'lip service' to criticisms of the practise, which they denounce as 'abusive and brutal'.
