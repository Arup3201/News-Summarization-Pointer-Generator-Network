A housekeeper was kidnapped, beaten and burned by her employers for eight hours after they accused her of stealing money and jewelry, reports claim.

Daisy Machuea, 54, was attacked as soon as she arrived at work in Queens, New York City, on February 13, police said.

Her employers, Devanand Lachman, 32, and his pregnant wife Ambar Lachman, 31, have been charged with felony assault, felony kidnapping and unlawful imprisonment.

Machuea told NBC New York that Devanand Lachman and another man, who remains at large, burned her with a plumber's torch and beat her with a blunt object. 

Once Ambar Lachman arrived, she says, the group then allegedly drove her to Machuea's house while holding her at knifepoint and tore apart the property.

Her friend and housemate Oscar Ramirez said he was watching TV when the suspects arrived and told him: 'If you move, the other guy will kill her,' before stealing their cell phones.

Both Machuea and Ramirez were left with severe injuries and went to the hospital.

Machuea was treated for severe burns and bruising.

'They kept punching, one guy this side, the other guy the other side,' Machuea said in Spanish, according to her friend and housemate Oscar Ramirez who translated for NBC.

Mr Lachman is in jail, while Mrs Lachman was released on bail.

Police are hunting their alleged accomplice, described as a six-foot-tall man aged 30 to 35 years old.
