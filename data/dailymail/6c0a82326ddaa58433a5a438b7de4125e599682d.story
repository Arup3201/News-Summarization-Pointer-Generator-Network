A murdered husband has been hailed a hero today by his devastated wife on Wednesday who said that he laid down his life to save the children from her ex-husband.  

Denise Mattison told ABC that when her ex, Plaxo co-founder Minh Nguyen, broke into her Virginia home last Thursday with a gun, her husband Corey lured him out of the back door and away from their children.

Mrs Mattison said that her daughter, Madison, 14, and a younger sibling were able to escape and hide out in the bathroom to call the police.

Mrs Mattison, who married her late husband three months ago, told the network: 'He was my knight in shining armor... he literally laid his life down to save me.'

The couple lived together with their five children - Mrs Mattison's three children from her marriage to Nguyen and Mr Mattison's two children from a previous relationship.  

Minh Nguyen, the 38-year-old co-founder of pre-Facebook social network Plaxo, was charged with first-degree murder on Tuesday.

Minh Nguyen has been charged with murder after allegedly shooting dead his ex-wife's new husband  

He was arraigned on Tuesday and was held without bond. 

He is due back to court for a January 28 bond hearing. 

He allegedly shot dead Corey Mattison, a former minor league pitcher with the St. Louis Cardinals, after breaking into the newlyweds' townhouse in Ashburn, Virginia.

Two of Nguyen's three children with his ex-wife were present at the time of the shooting at 9.30pm last Thursday, police said. 

Denise walked in with her third child during the attack, according to a reported from the Londoun County Sheriff's Office.     

Nobody else was injured in the attack.

Nguyen was arrested without incident after being captured by his mother, who held him down and called the police, NBC reported. 

Officers found the mother and son struggling over his gun. 

He was charged with first-degree murder and is being held without bond. 

Mattison, who had two elementary-school-aged children of his own, was a project manager at a glass construction company based in Washington, D.C., WPBF reported. 

His colleagues told the station Mattison spent a lot of time with his children as well as Nguyen's.

'Corey and his wife would go to a baseball game with the kids, and [Nguyen] would blow up,' his colleague Rick Knutson said. 

'He would try to prevent them from taking the kids anywhere. The guy seemed to be a little unstable.' 

Nguyen, a major figure in the U.S. technology business, co-founded Plaxo in 2002 with Sean Parker, Facebook's first president. The site has since been bought by Comcast.

The social network described itself as the 'world's leading online address book, storing over 50 million address books with 3.7 billion contacts'.

But Todd Masonis, a founder of Plaxo who was with the company through its sale to Comcast, said that 'in my nine years working on Plaxo, (Nguyen) wasn't involved in any capacity beyond some initial discussions with Sean (Parker, another Plaxo founder) before the company was incorporated'.

Masonis, who is no longer with Plaxo, said Nguyen 'never met or worked with any of our employees, investors, or partners. I only met him socially two or three times. 

'Unfortunately, he appears to have overstated his connection to the company. This is a really tragic situation and our hearts go out to his family.' 

Also, the edit history of Plaxo's Wikipedia page shows that as far back as 2006 a person identifying himself as Nguyen would edit the page to list himself as a founder any time he would be deleted. 

Court records from Nguyen's 2011 divorce do not indicate that he reaped any kind of lasting financial fortune from his association with the company.

The documents said Nguyen was unemployed at the time and had been making less than $50,000 a year in the years leading up to the divorce decree.

Papers show that he was ordered to pay only $750 a month in child support for the couple's three children. 

Nguyen, graduated from George Mason University with a degree in Multimedia Design in 1997, and was based in Washington, D.C.

Having started out as an interface programmer at AOL, Nguyen's post-Plaxo career saw him take up advising roles at numerous apps and websites.

In 2012, he became the founding CEO of App Press, which provided tools for designers to build, manage and deploy apps.

He is currently an advisor to for at least three tech firms and the chairman of Syllabuster, a mobile platform for students and teachers.

Tech company founder Nguyen, 38, allegedly broke into his ex-wife's home in Ashburn, Virginia, at 9.30pm on Thursday and shot dead her husband
