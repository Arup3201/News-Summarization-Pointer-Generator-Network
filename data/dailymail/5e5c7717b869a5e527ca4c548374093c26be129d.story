Celtic manager Ronny Deila has insisted that he has no regrets over publicly targeting a domestic treble in his first season as Celtic boss.

The Norwegian has set the bar high and riled opponents by repeatedly saying he wants nothing less than a clean sweep.

Jock Stein and Martin O’Neill are the only Parkhead managers in the club’s history to have achieved the feat.

Celtic boss Ronny Deila will be hoping to get his hands on the Scottish League Cup this weekend 

Deila believes he set his side a realistic target in trying to win a domestic treble 

However, Deila defended the treble talk, saying: ‘What’s the worst thing that can happen? That you don’t reach your goals?

‘I can say I am happy to win one title this year and reach a goal. But that’s boring. You can say something else, but everybody knows the demands of this club. I have said that all season and there is so much hard work and so many games but we have a good chance to win a trophy on Sunday and we have prepared for that.’

The accepted practice for managers is to try to remove pressure and expectation from the shoulders of their players by playing down trophy talk, but Deila rejects that idea completely.

‘I learned at Stromsgodset that if you say you are satisfied to be number six then you come sixth.

‘If you say then that you only want to get to the cup final then you lose the cup final.

‘You have to say you want to win the league or League Cup. You have to reach for something. It’s in your head mentally.

Martin O'Neill was the last manager to win the domestic treble at Celtic

‘This club is so big and has such a good team that it’s possible. If I didn’t think it was possible I wouldn’t say it. But I know it’s possible and that’s why I set high goals and make high demands.’

Desperate to win his first trophy as Celtic manager, Deila has removed a ban on his daughters attending games following some early setbacks when they attended.

‘I have to be fair with them. They were at the Aberdeen game, away, standing with the supporters. It was a crazy experience for them. They just said that the supporters were crazy and they don’t look at the football match. They smelled of smoke and beer. But they will be here on Sunday.’

Famously pictured removing his clothes on the pitch after Stromsgodset avoided relegation, Deila says he has no plans to embarrass his daughters by repeating the feat if he wins on Sunday.

‘They are used to it. They’ve seen their father doing stupid things before. They are 15 years old and they are probably a little embarrassed about that.

‘They were there when I took off my clothes after that game. We were sitting on the couch the day after that game, watching it on television. It was not a great sight. If we win on Sunday you can expect a good celebration with the others. I will not take off my clothes.’

Celtic’s rearranged Premiership fixture with Dundee at Dens Park will now be played on April 22, with a 7.45pm kick-off, because of the Parkhead side’s Scottish Cup quarter-final replay.
