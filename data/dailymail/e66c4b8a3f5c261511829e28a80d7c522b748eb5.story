A couple who disguised their Â£500,000 luxury house as a hay barn to outwit planning chiefs must tear down their home after losing the final round of a long-running legal battle.

Property developer Alan Beesley and wife Sarah became locked in the dispute with local authority planners after moving into the two-storey home, but today admitted 'this is the end'.

A last ditch attempt to overturn the council's orders that the property be demolished have failed.

Last ditch: Alan Beesley and his wife Sarah must demolish the home hidden in a barn after losing a final appeal

The couple won permission to build the windowless barn to store hay 12 years ago, but fitted it out as a home - complete with a study, bathroom, lounge, gym and three-bedrooms.

They lived there for four years before applying for the barn to be legally recognised as a home, but their actions incensed officers at Welwyn Hatfield Council in Hertfordshire.

The couple were refused permission, sparking a dispute which went to the Supreme Court in 2011, when seven judges ruled they must leave the house.

They said Mr Beesley had been dishonest and hatched a plan to 'mislead and deceive' planning bosses.

The court ruled the couple could not live in the house and they moved out eight months ago.

Costly: Mr Beesley revealed he has spent tens of thousands of pounds on the legal battle to keep his home

The council followed the ruling up with 
enforcement notices ordering the barn to be pulled down - which prompted the couple's latest failed appeal.

Mr Beesley, 41, and his 38-year-old 
wife now have a year to move out and remove the building from the land 
at Northaw, near Potters Bar.

Mr Beesley has said his legal fight to remain in the house has cost him tens of thousands of pounds.

Mr Beesley said today said: 'This is the end. We moved out of the house eight months ago. This latest appeal was not for the house, it was about the barn.

Dispute: The couple have been locked in a long-running planning row with the council over the barn

'They have ruled that we have to take the barn down as well. That is just the council for you.'

In 2011, Mr Beesley had said the couple were 'absolutely devastated' and 'gutted'. He said they were 'in limbo' and that his wife was 'in pieces.'

The couple built the house in Northaw, Hertfordshire, in 2001 and 
moved in a year later.

They hoped eventually to benefit from a rule 
allowing homeowners who have lived in a property for more than four 
years to stay - even if they do not have planning permission.

Change of mind: Mr Beesley claimed that he originally had no intention of living in the building

Mr Beesley claimed that he originally had no intention of living in the building, but changed his mind after a spate of burglaries in the area.

So he altered plans to relocate the large barn door and built extra doors and lighting, which were never approved by the council.

In 2007, the couple applied for a certificate of lawfulness, which would allow them to use the property as residential accommodation.

But planners objected and accused the couple of fraudulently building the home with the intention of living in it.

In April 2009, the High Court ordered their eviction, but the decision was overturned in January 2010.

All over: The Beesleys finally admitted today that the appeal decision marks the 'end' of the dispute

However, the Supreme Court reviewed the case in April 2011 and upheld the original judgment.

They ruled that Mr Beesley intended to deceive the council from the outset to exploit a legal loophole by secretly using the building as a residential home for four years.

A spokeswoman for Welwyn Hatfield Council said today: 'The council welcomes the appeal decision on the 'house in a barn.'

'We feel the decision is the right one, confirming the council's commitment to the enforcement of breaches of planning control.'

The couple could not be reached for comment.
