On Monday, Mrs Orzechowski's condition was said to have improved and was now 'fair'.

Brian and Crystal, who had been childhood friends since they were six years old, had a touching ceremony in their back yard that day surrounded by loved ones.

They had jumped into the pool after tying the knot and scoffed on wedding cake during a fun-filled Saturday with family and friends.

Just a few hours later at around 9.30pm as the couple drove to Clarks Hill Lake in Georgia to spend their wedding night, the horrific crash took place.

The late groom's mother told wrdw.com: 'I've been calling his phone just so I could hear his voice. I love you, Brian.

'And I miss you so much. I wish you could come home.'

She has drawn comfort from the fact that her son was extremely happy in the last hours of his life.
