Advice: M&S style director Belinda Earl says women should dress comfortably for work

Power-dressing is a thing of the past, according to the style director of Marks & Spencer.

Belinda Earl said women should embrace comfortable clothes for work, rather than trying to dress to impress or compete with men.

Instead of a strict uniform of black dresses and suits, she suggested a host of unconventional alternatives, including trendy culottes – flowing long shorts which fall below the knee.

She also advised women to wear cashmere knitwear and leather skirts and jackets.

M&S cashmere jumpers cost up to £200, while leather skirts are up to £249, meaning her recommendations might be beyond many budgets.

Mrs Earl wore a £55 Autograph animal print bodycon dress and a Per Una leather biker jacket, reduced from £199 to £74, to deliver yesterday’s talk entitled ‘Dress for the job you want’.

The former chief executive of Jaeger and Debenhams, told a conference that women were now ‘much more in control in the workplace over our individual style’.

She said: ‘Nowadays things have changed – it is no longer about trying to dress like the boys or flirt with the boys. The power-dressing we all remember ... life has really changed over the last 20 to 30 years.’

She singled out several items that women should consider investing in, including stretch animal print pencil skirts and a green faux fur jacket.

Highlighting three pairs of culottes, which were last popular in the 1990s, she said: ‘Actually it’s very easy to wear, particularly in the spring-summer which is a transitional season.’

She also recommended mini-skirts, pencil skirts and leather skirts, the latter of which she said were particularly popular at the M&S offices.

The 52-year-old also recommended investing in a good quality bag for work and a statement jacket.

She said: ‘The trophy jacket is really important in terms of putting together a look. You can wear a leather jacket during the day and faux fur in the evening and you are ready to rock.

Speaking at Management Today’s Inspiring Women conference, she urged the audience to develop their own ‘style handwriting’.

‘It is really important in today’s world, where we are all very judgemental, that we have a wardrobe that can really fit and flatter, that works for you, that actually gives you that inner confidence,’ she said.

‘If you know that you can look and feel your best, it can often help you not only rise to the dizzy heights of the great days but also it can maybe help you through some of the darker days too.’

A recent study found workers in the UK dress up for the office for fear of being judged on their professional performance.

Research for the Government’s Business is Great campaign showed 44 per cent of respondents admitted to judging colleagues by their attire.
