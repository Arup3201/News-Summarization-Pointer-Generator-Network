A seaside town  and a London borough are bucking a nationwide trend of ageing which will see the average age of the population hit its forties by 2037.

Towns and cities across the country are getting older, thanks to people living longer, with half of those born after 2007 expected to live to over 100.

While the average age of the population will be 43 in 2037, up from 36 in 1992, the the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham, and the seaside town of Bournemouth in Dorset, populations are getting younger.

In Barking, the average age is set to drop from 34 to 33.4 during the 45 year period- thanks to rising birth rates and the influx of young Londoners with families looking to get on the housing ladder.

By 2037, a quarter of all residents in the borough will be under 16 years old.

The county of Dorset has one of the oldest populations in the UK - Christchurch where almost 31 per cent of the population are pensioners- and one of the few places where the population is getting younger - Bournemouth where the age is due to drop from 41.3 to 41.

Bournemouth (pictured) is one of only two places in the UK where the age of the population is due to drop by 2037 

The fastest ageing areas were in rural Scotland where Eilean Siar (pictured) in the Western Isles's average age of 38.5 is set to increase to 55.7 - a 31 per cent increase 

The past decade has seen an influx of young professionals and migrants to the seaside town.

Britain's towns and cities are getting older as a national trend of ageing is set to put the UK's average age at 43

The fastest ageing areas were in rural Scotland where Eilean Siar in the Western Isles's average age of 38.5 is set to increase to 55.7 -  a 31 per cent increase. It will mean there will be fewer than one in seven will be under 16 by 2037. 

Inverclyde's population will age by 5.3 years while Clackmannanshire, the third fastest ageing location, will increase from a median of 35.4 to 49.5.

Experts are now warning that the rapidly ageing populations in rural Scotland could mean services such as doctors and schools come under threat.

Professor Robert Wright, a population expert at Strathclyde University, told The Independent: 

'The issue is that depopulation and rapid population ageing of more-remote regions means that it will become too expensive to provide services needed by an ageing population. Basically, people will need to move to receive them.'

The oldest parts towns and cities in Britain will be Rother in Sussex, and north Norfolk, where the median age will exceed 57 by 2037.

In contrast, the areas of the UK which are slowest to age include Southampton, Bristol, Nottingham and Norwich.
