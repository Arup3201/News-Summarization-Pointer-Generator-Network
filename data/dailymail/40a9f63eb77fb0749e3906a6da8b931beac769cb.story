A skateboard park has become a laughing stock in south Wales after satellite images revealed it had a rather unfortunate design.

Pictures from Google Earth were posted online this week showing that from above the facility in Porthcawl is distinctly phallic.

Google user Gareth Bishop noticed it and posted the picture asking: 'Anyone else notice the unfortunate design of the skate park?'

It led to a flood of responses with others pitching in with predictably wry comments.

Sean Bingham noted: 'Only in Porthcawl would you get a tarmac beach and a c***-shaped skate park.'

It is the latest example of unintentionally suggestive designs being spotted on sites like Google Maps and Google Earth.

But makers Maverick insist there was no mistake in the construction and the shape is one commonly used in the world of skate park design.

Designer Ian Jennings said: 'The 'c*** and balls' design is a highly functional favourite of skateboarders worldwide and Porthcawl is certainly not unique in having its own piece of phallic skate architecture.

'The fact Porthcawl has a version of this classic design is largely due to the input of some extremely well-travelled and experienced skaters in the area.'

He added: 'I remember the kink in the Porthcawl skate park plan was actually introduced to the design at a late stage to try to make it look less phallic.

The discovery of the skate park follows reports of this unfortunately-shaped housing estate in Merseyside

This Christian Science church in Illinois has also hit the headlines for the same reason

'We get these sort of comments a lot, unfortunately certain people seem to get really excited by a giant phallus. My response is usually that if yours is that shape you should probably have a chat with your GP!'

Porthcawl resident Ally Barr, 53, was a professional skateboarder in the 1970s and helped draw up the design which he claimed helped 'assist a smoother ride'.

'Most people don't actually notice the phallic likeness unless it's viewed from above,' he added.

'It consists of four separate entities that all come together in to what's known as a combi bowl, giving maximum satisfaction to the rider.'

Porthcawl Town Council described it as a 'great facility'.

A spokeswoman said: 'The town council, together with local people and organisations work to ensure that provisions are provided within the town for the residents and visitors in the area.

'The skate park is an example of the people in Porthcawl working together to produce a great facility for both the youth and adults within the town.

'The town council is extremely proud of this achievement and is delighted that it is still receiving so much interest nearly three years after its completion.'

The stir comes just months after residents in Merseyside were said to be worried about the value of their homes after it emerged their estate resembles a giant phallus when seen from above.

And in the U.S. a Christian Science church in Illinois hit the headlines for the same reason.
