Daily consumption of sugary drinks raises a woman's chances of suffering a blood clot on the brain

Women who treat themselves to a fizzy drink every day may be increasing their risk of a life-threatening stroke, new research shows.

Daily consumption of sugary drinks raises a woman’s chances of suffering a blood clot on the brain by about 80 per cent, Japanese scientists found.

But there was only a very slight increase in risk for men.

The findings, by a team of experts at Osaka University, partly support US research published earlier this year, which found both sugar-sweetened drinks and low-calorie alternatives raised the chances of strokes in both sexes.

British consumers get through an estimated 14 billion litres of soft drinks every year and consumption has more than doubled since the mid-1980s.

Numerous studies have linked rising consumption with the increased rate of obesity and type two diabetes, both of which are risk factors for strokes.

But few studies have examined the precise link between consumption of fizzy beverages and the rate of brain blood clots.

Strokes kill around 200 people every day in the UK.

Many more are left disabled and living in fear that a second or even third attack could kill them.

It’s estimated to cost the NHS £2.3 billion a year to treat and look after the 100,000 people annually struck down by the life-threatening condition.

Around 85 per cent of stroke victims are affected by ischaemic strokes, where a clot travels to the brain and shuts off its blood supply

Only cancer and heart disease kill more people.

Around 85 per cent of victims are affected by ischaemic strokes, where a clot travels to the brain and shuts off its blood supply.

The rest are called haemorrhagic strokes, where a blood vessel bursts in the brain, causing potentially fatal bleeding.

The Osaka team tracked almost 40,000 men and women aged between 40 and 59 over an 18-year period, documenting dietary habits, including consumption of soft drinks.

During that period, almost 2,000 of the volunteers suffered a stroke.

They analysed drinking habits of the stroke victims and compared them with those who did not develop clots.

The results, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, showed women who had a daily soft drink were 83 per cent more likely to suffer an ischaemic stroke - where a clot shuts off blood supply to the brain - than women who rarely or never had one.

The researchers said they found no link with haemorrhagic strokes or heart disease.

In a report on their findings they said: ‘Soft drink intake was positively associated with risk of ischaemic stroke for women.’
