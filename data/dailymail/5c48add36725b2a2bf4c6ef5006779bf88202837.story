A girl with severe learning disabilities was plied with drugs until she 'felt dead' while her teenage pimp passed her around for sex at a party, the Old Bailey heard.

The victim, who can only be referred to as A, was one of five under-age girls allegedly abused by  a gang led by Zdeno ‘Skinny’ Mirga, 18, in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire.

She told a court how she was subjected to a string of abuses, including on one occasion being forced to perform sex acts on a dozen boys in a park while Mirga collected £20 a time.

In an another horrific episode, she was allegedly trapped by a much-older associate of Mirga, and his cousin, who abused her so severely that she vomited when the ordeal was over.

The schoolgirl, who has learning disabilities and is partially deaf, had lost her virginity to Mirga in a park toilet when she was just 13 years old, jurors heard.

In videotaped interviews shown to the Old Bailey, she accused the Eastern European teenager of forcing her to perform sex acts on him and other males in various locations, despite her objections that it hurt.

Mirga, along with his brother, Dusan Mirga, 20, David Ziga, 19, and Hassan Abdulla, 32, deny a long list of sexual abuse charges ranging from rape to child prostitution.

Four minors MH, 14, JK, 17, RB, 17, and JF, 14, are standing trial alongside them.

The Kurdish, Czech and Slovak gang, who have to wear headphones and have interpreters in the dock to understand proceedings, are said to have targeted five young girls aged between 13 and 14 at the time of the abuse.

The court heard that Abdulla had trapped A in his home and refused to let her leave unless she performed sex acts on him and his cousin.

The court was shown an interview with police made in January this year, in which the girl - who is of Czech origin - said that Abdulla had threatened to hit her if she refused to obey his sick demands.

She said that after both accused raped her and forced her to perform sex acts on them she was sick.

The victim, who was allegedly abused by all eight defendants, told police she 'hated' and 'wants to fight' the female friend who would take her to Abdulla’s house, yet was never touched by him or his cousin.

Earlier, jurors heard about a party A attended, where she was plied with drink and drugs until she practically passed out and was passed around by Mirga.

Reliving the experience in April in a second video shown to the court, the youngster said she was first forced into performing a sex act on a a 50-year-old man for £20 before Mirga took her to the party in a taxi.

There she performed sex acts on a further five 'boys', for which 'they gave skinny money', she said, adding: 'He was happy. He said if you don’t do it, I will slap you. I feel upset, I was scared.'

During the videos shown to the jury, the youngster repeatedly told of times she was allegedly forced to allow associates of Mirga to rape her, while others laughed as they waited their turn.

Many of the alleged abuses were said to have taken place in parks around Peterborough, where she described being sexually abused in bushes, on benches and on picnic tables.

At the same park in Peterborough on a different day, Mirga tied the schoolgirl to a chair and threatened to steal her clothes and took her phone because she did not want to have sex as she was on her period.

The court heard how his friends had laughed as Mirga used her own blue and white scarf to tie her up before raping her.

Mirga allegedly threatened to hit the girl on other occasions if she did not cooperate as he wanted the money from pimping her out for 'weed and vodka'.

The girl insists she was clear to the defendants that she was 13 at the time.

Abdulla is accused of four counts of rape, two counts of sexual activity with a child and two counts of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity relating to A.

He also faces a charge of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity relating to A’s sister, who was also 13 at the time.
