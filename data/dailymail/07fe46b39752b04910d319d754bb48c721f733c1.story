Carol Vorderman has unveiled plans to fly around the world solo - following in the footsteps of pioneering aviator Amelia Earhart.

The former Countdown presenter hopes to set off on her 29,000-mile journey next year, swapping the ITV Loose Women studio for the cockpit.

Her route will take her across Mexico, Sudan and Pakistan - mirroring the ill-fated trip that Amelia made in 1937.

Amazingly, Carol only started learning to fly with her 21-year-old daughter Katie in California last summer.

New challenge: Carol Vorderman has unveiled plans to fly around the world, following in the footsteps of hero Amelia Earhart

Giving up her spot on the ITV show, the 
52-year-old will attempt to recreate the famous flight, with her 
boyfriend Graham Duff, a former Red Arrows Squadron leader, joining her 
in a support aircraft.

The couple have bought their own plane which is a single-engined Diamond DA40 which has four seats.

'It's something I've always wanted to do and I've got to the point in life where I just decided to do it,' she told The Mirror.

'It's been my dream for decades and if I don't do it now, I never will. I'm totally obsessed with flying,' she added.

She hopes to have her own licence later this year so she can embark on the round-the-world journey solo.

The former Countdown presenter has 
always been vocal about her passion for aviation, but put her ambitions 
on hold by her television commitments.

Support: Carol's boyfriend Graham Duff, a former Red Arrow, will follow just behind her in a separate plane

She hoped to get a job working as an 
engineer at British Airways after she graduated from Cambridge 
University, but instead ended up working at a hydro-electric 
power station before landing a job on Countdown.

Carol went public with her romance 
with Graham last year and told all of her fans that he'd inspired her to
take up flying, tweeting pictures of herself and daughter Katie posing 
by planes.

She will take to the skies four times a week as she prepared for the flight.

But
the star, who is usually spotted out in skintight dresses and stilettos
may be in for quite a lifestyle change on the arduous trip.

Hero: Carol has cited Amelia Earhart as her inspiration for the flight, although the aviation pioneer disappeared during her attempt in 1937

'It's not like you just fly from one 
major airport to another - it's one airfield to another, get the tent 
out the back and kip overnight, and then back in again and set off,' she
said.

Luckily for her, 
Carol will have her other half following some distance behind her, so he
will be on hand if something goes wrong.

Carol lists Earhart and her fellow aviation pioneer Amy Johnson as her heroes.

Johnson became the first woman to fly
from England to Australia solo in 1930 and was famous around the world.
She later died during World War II.

Amelia Earhart went missing during her round-the-world attempt in 1937 after becoming the first female pilot to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean.

She was formally declared dead in 1939 but her remains have never been found.

Amelia was on the final stage of an an ambitious around-the-world flight along the equator in a twin-engine Lockheed Electra when she and navigator Fred Noonan disappeared.

Earhart had set off from New Guinea to refuel at Howland Island for a final long-distance hop to California.

In what turned out to be her final radio message, she declared she was unable to find Howland and that fuel was running low.

Several search-and-rescue missions ordered the next day by then-president Franklin Roosevelt turned up no trace of Earhart or Noonan, who were eventually presumed dead at sea.

An aircraft recovery team recently claimed to have captured the remains in a grainy sonar image captured off an 
uninhabited Pacific Island.

The image was captured off an 
uninhabited tropical island in the southwestern Pacific republic of 
Kiribati and showed an 'anomaly' at a depth of 600 feet in the waters.

Discovery: A grainy sonar image captured off an uninhabited Pacific 
island could show the remains of Amelia Earhart's doomed plane which 
disappeared in 1937. The shadow, at a depth of 600ft, might show her plane. The International Group for Historical Aircraft Recovery believe it could pave the way to finally solving the mystery

The International Group for Historic 
Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR) believe the evidence could finally pave the 
way to solving the 76-year-old mystery.

Conspiracy theories about Earhart's final moments have flourished for years. One contended that Earhart was held by Japanese imperial forces as a spy.

Another claimed she completed her flight, but changed her identity and settled in New Jersey.

Earhart's story - as well as her mysterious demise - have captivated America for decades.

She has been portrayed on the big screen by A-List actresses like Diane Keaton, Amy Adams and Hillary Swank.

The most widely accepted theory is that the aircraft ran out of fuel and ditched in the sea. There have been several searches by many different professionals eager to solve the mystery, but none have been proven.

Another popular theory is that they landed on the island of Nikumaroro in the Pheonix Islands, 350 miles southeast of Howland Island and fended for themselves for several months until they succumbed to injury or disease.

Improvised tools and bits of Plexiglas that are consistent with that of an Electra window were found on the island.

A few theorists reckon that she Earhart was spying on Japan and had been captured and executed. This theory has been discounted by the American authorities and press.

A rumour claimed that she was one of many women sending messages on Tokyo Rose, an English-language Japanese propaganda station designed to attack the Allies' morale.

An Australian aircraft engineer said he found a map that showed Earhart and Noonan may have turned round to try and refuel but crashed before getting to an airstrip.

The most whacky theory is that she was still alive and had a different identity.

A woman from New Jersey successfully sued for $1.5m in damages from the author of a book who pursued this theory.
