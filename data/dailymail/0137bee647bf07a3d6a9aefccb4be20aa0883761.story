The Ministry of Justice said today it would be 'difficult or impossible' for convicted rapist Ched Evans to play football abroad due to the terms of his licence 

He has denied his guilt and failed to apologise to the teenage girl he is convicted of raping in a hotel room since being released from prison, with his long-term partner claiming all he wants to do is return to football. 

But  rapist Ched Evans'  may never play professionally again,with terms of his sex offender's licence rendering it near impossible for him to work abroad, the Ministry of Justice said today. 

It comes after the 25-year-old's former club, Sheffield United, revoked his invitation to train on their grounds this week. 

No other British clubs have expressed interest in signing the criminal since his early release from Wymott Prison on October 17 despite the Professional Footballers' Association saying yesterday it hoped he would be made an offer.  

Rumours swirled Evans may have been picked up by the Irish Professional Footballers' Association after its lawyer wrote an online article claiming he could be innocent.

However it was said today  it would be 'difficult or impossible' for a sex offender to meet the terms of their licence while working abroad.

'We do not comment on individual prisoners. 

'In general terms, a sex offender on licence would have to have regular meetings with their offender manager and that is difficult or impossible to do if they are living abroad,' a spokesman told MailOnline this morning. 

Evans, who plans to appeal his 2012 conviction for raping a teenage waitress in a hotel in Rhyl, North Wales, served just half of the five-year sentence he handed.

The remainder of the sentence will be completed on licence, meaning he must regularly check in with an offender manager until 2016. 

By the time he has completed his entire sentence, he will be 27, and will remain on the Sex Offenders Register for life. 

Following his release last month, pressure mounted on Sheffield United not to resign the player or welcome him back to its grounds. 

A string of its patrons tendered their resignations over the issue, with Olympian Jessica Ennis-Hill vowing to have her name removed from one of the stands at Bramall Lane should he be reinstated. 

After failing to take a public stance for days, the club revealed Evans would be allowed to train with former teammates but did not invite him to return permanently.

Their invitation was revoked this week after mass public outcry.  In a statement, the club said the public reaction to their actions could not have been 'anticipated'. 

'The Club initially accepted a request from The PFA for Ched Evans to be able to train. The reaction to this has been at an intensity that could not have been anticipated when first announced.

The former footballer, pictured with his long-term girlfriend Natasha Massey, has protested his innocence despite being convicted of raping a teenage girl in 2011

'The club condemns rape and violence of any kind against women in the strongest possible terms.'

The Professional Footballers' Association accepted the club's decision, but added it hoped Evans would be given a job elsewhere. 

'It may ultimately be of benefit to both parties to move on and for Ched to look for a fresh start at a different club.

'It is hoped that Ched will be given an opportunity at another club to return to the job he is trained to do,' a statement released yesterday read. 

Sheffield United co-chairman Jim Phipps argued condemned the decision as unfair, saying he was 'angry' Evans wasn't given a second chance.

‘I’m angry we are not able to get a chance to do for this footballer what should be done,’ said Phipps. 

‘I’m upset that we are not able to do what we wanted to do, but I acknowledge that my view is not the only view. My principles and the board’s principles are not the only thing that matter.

‘The influence of mob-like behaviour has made it difficult to take the simple step of allowing Ched to train.' 

Earlier this week, the Irish Professional Footballers' Association's lawyer wrote an online article claiming the former player could be innocent. 

Likening the situation to that of the Guildford Four, who had their convictions over the Guildford Bombing quashed following a lengthy public campaign, Stuart Gilhooly wrote: 'This crime, as alleged, was at the bottom end. 

Before his release the former athlete's long-term girlfriend Natasha Massey said 'all he wanted to do' was return to his professional career

Sheffield United co-chairman Jim Phipps said he was 'angry' the club had been forced to retract its invitation for Ched Evans to train there again and likened public outcry to 'mob-like behaviour' 

'There was no violence and thankfully the victim has no recollection of it. This, I hasten to add, does not make it right, or anything close to it, but it is nonetheless a mitigating factor.' 

It has since been removed from PFA Ireland's website. 

Last month Charlie Webster resigned as a patron of Sheffield United: 'It influences the next generation and I don’t believe it is sending out the right message to employ a convicted rapist.

‘I won’t stand here and represent that. Not in my name, not in my community and not in my club.’ 

In September, the former footballer's long-term girlfriend, Natasha Massey. said 'all he wanted to do' was to return to his professional sporting career.

Speaking ahead of his dawn release, she told the Daily Mirror:  'He's a professional footballer and he just wants to get on the pitch and score goals. It think he should be allowed to do that.

'All Ched wants to do is go back to work, do the job he loves and then just come home and have a family life.' 

May 30, 2011: CCTV shows footballer Clayton McDonald meeting victim outside a kebab shop in Rhyl at around 4am, before taking a cab with her to a nearby Premier Inn. On the way he texts friend Ched Evans to say he's 'got a bird'.

Mr McDonald and Evans both had intercourse with the girl, and at one point two other men tried to film it though a window.

After waking up in the hotel room with no memory of the incident, the victim went to police, and later the same day Evans and Mr McDonald are both arrested.

July 26, 2011:  Evans and Mr McDonald are charged with rape, which they both deny.

April 11, 2012: Evans and Mr McDonald take the stand for the first time at Caernarfon Crown Court.

April 20: Mr McDonald is acquitted of rape, while Evans is found guilty and sentenced to five years in prison.

During the trial Evans told the court that he had gone to the hotel after getting a text from Mr McDonald, and let himself into the room where he found the pair having sex.

He claimed to have watched them before having sex with the victim himself, while two other men watched through the window and attempted to film it.

April 23: The victim is named for the first time online by supporters of Evans, who begin bombarding her with abuse that police will later compare to 'virtual GBH'.

Officers subsequently take the unusual step of giving the woman a false identity and moving her away from her home - protection usually reserved for high-profile murderers released from jail.

August: Evans has request to appeal his conviction turned down, though this is later overturned by the Court of Appeal in London.

November, 2013: Evans continues to deny guilt and recruits new legal team to help clear his name.

October 17, 2014: He is released from jail after serving half of his sentence and returns home to Rhyl where a bouncy castle is pictured being delivered to his parents' house, but is later taken away. 

October 18: Reports surface that Evans has been offered a £500,000 contract to re-sign for Sheffield United, though the club later deny the rumours. 

November 11: After a request from the Professional Footballers' Association, Sheffield United agree to allow Evans to return to the club to train, but refuse to say whether he will be signed.

The same day patron Charlie Webster, who was abused as a child, walks away from the club.

November 12: Lindsay Graham, another club patron, cuts her ties with the club along with another unnamed patron as 150,000 sign petition saying Evans should not be allowed to play again.

November 13: Jessica Ennis-Hill asks for her name to be removed from one of the club's stands, leading to abuse on Twitter.

November 17: Karl Massey, the millionaire father of Evans' girlfriend Natasha Massey, says he will offer the former-footballer a job at one of his firms if the club will not have him back

November 20: Sheffield United confirm that they have withdrawn the offer to allow Evans to train at their ground.

November 22:  The Ministry of Justice said while it cannot comment on individual prisoners, in general terms the terms of a sex offender's licence would render it near impossible to work abroad, scuppering any hopes that Evans may be signed overseas for the remainder of his sentence.
