Fast food-loving newlyweds came up with the perfect way to celebrate their marriage after commissioning special portraits of themselves on a pair of pizzas.

Newlyweds Kieran and Natasha Morris, from Bury, Manchester, asked their favourite pizza company, Domino's, to recreate their faces on two large 13inch pizza bases, complete with tomato puree, ham and sweetcorn.

The pizza firm turned to celebrity portrait artist, Nathan Wyburn, who has previously appeared on Britain's Got Talent and specialises in creating iconic pictures out of everything from Marmite on toast, to ketchup, sugar, chocolate, toothpaste and even fake tan.

In just three hours, the pizza perfect creations were ready and presented to the happy couple on Saturday, following the ceremony in Preston, Lancashire.

Kieran said they decided to order the unusual dish as a surprise for guests who are always joking about how much pizza the couple eat.

He said: 'The pizza-selfie portraits were like nothing we could have imagined - definitely our most unusual wedding present!

'We were completely overwhelmed to see our faces on the pizzas, and the guests absolutely loved them.

'We order Domino's pizza all the time - so it felt right to incorporate them into the most special day of our lives.'

Support worker Kieran and student Natalie started dating seven years ago.

Ahmed Faraz from Domino's, said: 'We are really excited that Domino's are able to be a part of Kieran and Natasha's big day in such a unique way.

'It's been really fun working behind the scenes to recreate the pizza-selfies for such big fans and we wish them all the best for the future.'
