Sevilla have officially completed the signing of Liverpool forward Iago Aspas on a season-long loan.

The Spanish striker passed a medical on Friday after the two clubs agreed a deal, which includes the option to buy permanently, earlier in the week and the paperwork has now been finalised.

Aspas, 26, moved to Anfield from Celta Vigo last summer but had a disappointing season and made just 15 appearances, the majority as a substitute, and scored one goal.

Heading home: The Spanish striker managed just one goal in his season at the club

The forward cost Liverpool £9million last year, but failed to adapt to a lack of playing time and the English weather during his season at Anfield.

'My experience in the Premier League was fabulous on a collective level, but on an individual level it was very hard for me, because I went from playing all the time to not playing at all,' he told Spanish radio station Cadena Ser.

Short stay: Aspas will join Sevilla on a season-long loan, with the possibility of a permanent deal

'Even though people say Galicians are used to seeing clouds in the sky and a similar climate to the one in Liverpool, once you return here you treasure Spain a lot more.

'I hope I can adapt and climatise to Sevilla as quickly as possible.'
