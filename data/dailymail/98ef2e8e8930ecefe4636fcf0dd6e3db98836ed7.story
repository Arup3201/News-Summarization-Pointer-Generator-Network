A stressed-out student trying to make his life easier tried a cheeky way to skip the last few chapters of a novel set as homework - only for it to sensationally backfire.

The student took to Yahoo! Answers earlier this week, asking for a book summary of The Boy Who Couldn't Sleep And Never Had To, by D.C. Pierson, admitting he had not finished the book.

By the following day, however, the student was rumbled - not by an angry teacher or disappointed parent, but by the novel's author... who was not impressed.

Caught out online: A student was reprimanded by author DC Pierson after he posted this on Yahoo! Answers in an attempt to get away with not reading Pierson's novel for an assignment

The author reprimanded the student posting: ‘I'm bummed out that you don't want to try and finish it, and not even because you think it's bad, but just because it seems like work instead of like fun.’

Pierson told TODAY.com that he was particularly bothered by the student’s ‘huffy list of excuses’ for not finishing the 226-page novel including being a slow reader and his local library was undergoing renovations.

Angry author: DC Pierson, right, was pleased his book The Boy Who 
Couldn't Sleep and Never Had To, left, made it on a school reading list 
but was not impressed by a student's online attempt to do an assignment 
without reading it

Under the username ♥ Idiot America ~ 
ϟƘƦІןן∑x ♥, the student had written in his original post: ‘I haven't 
been able to finish this book. Can someone give me a complete review, 
including everything important? I REALLY need this! AND it's not because
I'm slacking.’

Reading low: With a low national reading level, American students are assigned books appropriate for a 5th grader

Pierson, who is also a founding member 
of improvisation group Derrick Comedy, was quick to post photos on 
Twitter and Tumblr of a screenshot of the Yahoo! post joking that he was
a ‘full service author’.

He tried to convince the student it was worth finishing the book.

Pierson wrote: 'I think you'll find there's a ton more sex, swearing, and drugs in my book than anything else you have been or will be assigned in high school.'

Others posted a range of responses from calling the student lazy and a whinger to encouraging him to read the book. 

Released in March, a report on American high school students found that national reading levels remained low, with assigned book lists reflecting a level appropriate for 5th grade students.

Only 34 per cent of students were rated proficient in reading on the 2011 National Assessment of Educational Progress, an exam done every two year. The national 12th grade reading level was lower in 2009 than in 1992.

The lowest SAT critical reading scores were recorded last year.

First off, I'm really excited that my book is being suggested for summer reading. On the other hand, I'm bummed out that you don't want to try and finish it, and not even because you think it's bad, but just because it seems like work instead of like fun.

I'm not going to sit here and act like I didn't sometimes not read assigned books for class in high school.

Even though it's referenced once in my book, the book you're avoiding reading, I've never actually read "The Scarlet Letter." So I'm sympathetic to your plight.

But I think you'll find there's a ton more sex, swearing, and drugs in my book than anything else you have been or will be assigned in high school, and I don't mean in the way your teacher will tell you "You know, Shakespeare has more sex and violence than an R-rated movie!"

I mean it's all there, in terms you will readily understand without having to Google them. Plus not once to I refer to anything as a "bare bodkin" or anything like that.
