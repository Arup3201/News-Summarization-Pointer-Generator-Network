Police in Houston have charged two men for the brutal murder of 14-year-old Jose Meraz, who was slashed to death with a machete.

The boy's mutilated body was discovered in a heavily wooded area near the Addicks Reservoir by a dog walker. 

A third suspect, a 14-year-old male is being referred to Harris County Juvenile Probation Department authorities on a murder charge.

14-year-old Jose Meraz was slashed to death with a machete and his body was left in a wooded area

Meraz was a student at Houston's Stovall Middle School and was known as the 'Traveler' as he lived with various family members and friends when his parents returned to their native Honduras. 

According to relatives, the lack of stability affected him and he grew depressed. His emotional state meant he was targeted as a potential recruit by gangs and he was a member for a short time. 

However, he found comfort when he moved in with his aunt and then Maria and Jose Martinez, pastors of Minesterio Internacional Restaurando Los Muros, at a house church in north Houston.

In the weeks afterward, he seemed to have turned a new page, the couple said. 

Meraz's body was discovered on September 17, two days after he was brutally murdered - police in Houston have now charged Jose Granados-Guevara, 22, and William Alexander Valladares, 17 with murder

Police said Meraz's decision to 'want out' of a gang was 'one of the motivating factors that led to his death'

Following his death, friends and family linked his death to the Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13 gang, which is known for using machetes when carrying out acts of violence.

Police and federal authorities have declined to discuss the specifics of the killing but said his decision to leave the gang was a 'motivating factor' that led to his death. 

HPD Homicide Division Sergeant Sturdivant said: 'Jose Meraz was a member of this organization for a short amount of time and he did not want to be a member in the future he wanted out and that was one of the motivating factors that led to his death.' 

Though gang violence is a persistent problem in parts of Houston, Meraz's death has stood out for its savagery and for his youth.

Meraz had been a pupil at Stovall Middle School, 25 miles away from where his body was found. Principal Elsa Wright said: 'We grieve the loss of one of our students. We express our sincerest condolences to the family'

Houston police homicide detectives arrested Jose Granados-Guevara, 22, and William Alexander Valladares, 17. They are both charged with murder.

A third suspect, a 14-year-old male is being referred to Harris County Juvenile Probation Department authorities on a murder charge.

Police have also charged Granados-Guevara with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon for shooting a person in June.
