England have got to play keep ball

England played well on Saturday and it was good to see them going for it in attack, but I still worry that we don’t keep the ball well enough.

The stats say England completed 91 per cent of their passes, but everything was done at 100mph. As a neutral that’s great because it makes for exciting, end-to-end stuff but it’s impossible to keep up that tempo in the heat.

When you do lose possession against a side as good on the ball as Italy, you end up chasing shadows. By the end of the match England players were on the floor with cramp. You didn’t see any Italians going down exhausted.

That’s because they know how to take the sting out of a game. When they need to they make simple passes so the players can grab a breather. Until England learn to do that, we will still struggle against the very best sides.

England’s options for a perfect 10

This week, Roy Hodgson will have to make the biggest managerial call of his England career: who should he play at number 10 against Uruguay?

There will be a clamour for Roy to drop Wayne Rooney but Uruguay would be delighted if he was not on the team-sheet. They will have a second-string right back after Maxi Pereira got sent off so why not put Raheem Sterling out there? He is excellent in the middle but just as comfortable playing wide.

Rooney’s best position is through the middle, not out on the left.

In Sterling and Ross Barkley, England have two unique players. Sterling can play anywhere and even though he didn’t have many minutes, Barkley came on and did well cutting inside.

Roy has plenty of options but Rooney is wasted on the wings. If he does change it, then Danny Welbeck could be the one to be sacrificed. There’s no doubt he works hard for the team but he doesn’t create enough. I’d like to see more from him if he still plays.

Perfection from Pirlo

95.4% - Pirlo's pass completion rate against England in Manaus, the best of any midfielder on the pitch. 

Andrea Pirlo is my kind of midfielder — he really is the conductor of the orchestra.  He might be 35 but Pirlo glides across the pitch and makes time stand still when he’s on the ball.

He dominated England at EURO 2012 with 114 passes before killing them off with his chipped penalty. He was at it again on Saturday.

In Manaus he ‘only’ managed 103 passes but it was always the right one. Wherever he is on the pitch Italy look to him because they know he will keep possession and give them all a breather. 

He is a joy to watch and you’d love to have an Englishman like him, but players like Pirlo don’t come along very often.

Sturridge showing a killer instinct

For 70 minutes against Italy, Daniel Sturridge was causing their defence all sorts of problems. He really he can scare opposition defences with his movement.

He always wants to dribble at people with pace, which is terrifying for any defender but he gets into good positions, too. Just look at his finish for England’s goal.

It was a great move, started by Sterling’s wonderful pass — he’s more than just a dribbler — and set up by Rooney. It was England at their very best.

Better form: Sturridge continued his scoring streak this season when he converted Rooney's cross on 37 minutes

Inch-perfect: Rooney's cross was right on the boot of Sturridge to turn home and bring England level at 1-1
