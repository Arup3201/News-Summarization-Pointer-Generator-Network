Several very special young people have re-created Pharrell Williams' hit video 'Happy' to raise awareness for Rainbows Hospice in the East Midlands.

The hospice cares for children and young adults with life-limiting and terminal illness.

Although there are inevitably sad times, the children and staff wanted to make it clear that the facility is a truly happy place - filled with fun, laughter, and special memories.

Happiest place on Earth: Staff and children re-create heartwarming music video to Pharrell Williams' 'Happy'

Over 100 staff, volunteers, and children from Rainbows Hospice took part in the project

More than 100 children, staff, and volunteers took part in the video, which was filmed at Rainbows in Leicestershire.

The video is also in celebration of the 20th birthday of the hospice.

A group of young people, aged 19 to 30, who currently come to Rainbows for respite and day care, came up with the concept and chose the locations, formatted the ideas, choreographed the dances and even assisted with editing and directing. 

'Most children involved in the video have been at Rainbows for many years,' said musical therapist, Neil Eaves

Musical therapist Neil Eaves said: 'The young people told me they would love to re-create the video, based on the one by Pharrell Williams, and we tried to get everyone involved.'

'It is something they have come up with themselves and taken it on.'

'The young people have seen their idea right through from conception to an end product and have been involved in it every step of the way.'

'It has been so much fun, they have enjoyed it and rightly feel very proud.'

The project was something the young adults 'came up with themselves' from conception to end product

Some might think a hospice is a sad place, but Rainbows is focused on fun, laughter and special memories

The video took six months to create in total and was funded by a donation from a supporter.

'A lot of the young people involved in the video have been here for many years and have seen Rainbows expand and grow, while they themselves have grown from children into young adults,' Eaves added.

'They know Rainbows is a happy place and they want to celebrate happiness.'

'It wasn't about Rainbows the building; it was about what Rainbows stands for and to show that it is the people who make it such a special place to be.'
