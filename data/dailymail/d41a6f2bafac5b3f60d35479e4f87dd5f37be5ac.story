Victim: Della Callagher, 46, started to feel ill on the evening of Christmas Day after the meal at the Railway Hotel in Hornchurch, Essex. She died two days later

A woman who died from food poisoning two days after eating a pub Christmas Day lunch had been sent home from hospital and told to lie down.

Della Callagher, 46, was one of 30 diners to fall ill after eating a £39.95 four-course meal at the Railway Hotel in Hornchurch, Essex.

But while the others started to recover, her condition deteriorated and on Boxing Day her husband John took her to the nearest  accident and emergency unit.

Despite the fact she was obviously very unwell, Mr Callagher claims that doctors merely gave her an anti-sickness injection and told her to ‘go home and lie down’.

Her condition worsened, and that evening he called an ambulance fearing she barely had a pulse.

She died the following day at Queen’s Hospital in Romford, less than 24 hours after being sent home by doctors in the casualty unit.

Mr Callagher, 51, chief executive of a recruitment firm, said the hospital had ‘turned my wife away’ rather than trying to save her life.

‘They sent her home and she just lay in my arms, basically she was dying. We called an ambulance and went back to the hospital but she barely had a pulse. It was disgusting the way she was dealt with.’

Last autumn the hospital’s A&E unit was heavily criticised by the official watchdog which warned that at times the standards of care were ‘collapsing’.

Suspected: Della Callagher was one of 30 diners to fall ill after eating a four-course meal at the Railway Hotel in Homechurch, Essex

The Care Quality Commission also found half of patients were having to wait more than an hour to be seen by a doctor or nurse.

Speaking from his home in Hornchurch,
Mr Callagher said: ‘If she was rolling around on the floor they would 
have admitted her – but because she was dignified she wasn’t.

‘Della was so fit and healthy, I 
can’t believe it. This is devastating.We were about to celebrate our 
25th wedding anniversary.’

Mr Callagher, who has a 14-year-old 
daughter, said he planned to sue Barking, Havering and Redbridge Trust, 
which runs Queen’s Hospital, and the Railway Hotel where they had the 
meal.

Officials from the Health Protection 
Agency have since confirmed that Mrs Callagher, whose funeral will take 
place today, had contracted Clostridium perfringens, a common form of 
food poisoning that strikes around 90,000 Britons a year.

Investigation: The Health Protection Authority has launched an investigation with Havering Council to establish whether there are links between the outbreak of food poisoning and food eaten at the Railway Hotel

It is not usually fatal and only one 
in around 10,000 victims die – mainly the elderly, babies or those with 
an underlying illness.

Symptoms include stomach cramps and diarrhoea which usually resolve themselves without treatment within 24 hours.

It is caused by eating turkey, chicken or red meat that has been contaminated by Clostridium perfringens bacteria.

If food is left outside a fridge for a
long period of time the bacteria multiply. It is not clear whether this
outbreak was caused by infected turkey or cold meat starters that had 
been served beforehand.

Treatment: Mrs Callagher was initially seen at Queen's Hospital in Romford, pictured

One guest at the pub who was among the 30 to have been struck down said he had ‘never felt so ill in his life.’

John Rowe, who lives in Hornchurch 
said: ‘It ruined my Christmas and New Year, but luckily I survived it. 
I’m very sad to hear that a lady has died.’

A spokesman for Ember Inns, which 
runs the Railway Tavern said: ‘The local authority is investigating an 
alleged food poisoning outbreak at the Railway.

‘We are fully co-operating. Until the investigation is complete we can’t speculate about a possible cause or source.’

The hospital has apologised to the family although it insisted its staff gave ‘appropriate’ treatment.
Dr Mike Gill, medical director of the trust, promised to ‘fully review’ the case.

The trust is currently facing severe financial difficulties having amassed debts of £50million.

The bacterium Clostridium perfringens is widely distributed in the environment and food. It is the third most common cause of food poisoning in the UK.

If spores of the bacteria survive cooking, they can germinate to form growing cells. Spores cannot grow in a refrigerator or freezer but thrive at room temperature.

In optimal growing conditions, the organism has a generation time of 10 to 12 minutes. When a large number of the vegetative cells are consumed this will more-likely-than-not lead to gastroenteritis.

Nasty: The bacterium Clostridium perfringens is widely distributed in the environment and food

Food poisoning from the bacteria most often occurs when foodstuffs, usually red meat or poultry, is prepared in advance and kept warm for several hours before serving.

The illness, with diarrhoea and abdominal pain the main symptoms, generally lasts for less than 24 hours but elderly people may be more seriously affected.

The bacteria is also responsible for 80-95 per cent of gas gangrene cases, a rare but severe form of gangrene.
