Jak Alnwick will make his first start at St James’ Park in the Tyne-Wear derby – and the rookie goalkeeper is being backed to take his chance and win a new contract.

Newcastle – without senior goalkeepers Tim Krul and Rob Elliot until January because of injury – will not be allowed by the Premier League to bring in a replacement stopper on an emergency-loan deal.

Manager Alan Pardew, however, was always minded to give Alnwick a run in the team after his performance during the second half of Saturday’s 2-1 victory over Chelsea.

And the 21-year-old – who is out of contract in the summer - will now make his full Premier League debut at Arsenal this weekend before keeping goal for the League Cup quarter-final at Spurs and then the visit of North-East rivals Sunderland.

Andy Woodman is the Newcastle goalkeeping coach who works with Alnwick on a daily basis, and he believes the young custodian will not be fazed by the step up to senior level.

‘Jak’s an incredibly mature young man,’ said Woodman, whose 17-year-old son, Freddie, will now take his place on the bench as back-up to Alnwick.

‘You wouldn’t think he’s just 21 talking to him or indeed watching him play out there.

‘I wouldn’t have any worries about Jak because there is this calmness and assurance about him and I think against Chelsea his team-mates saw that and it gave them confidence.

‘He’s like a lot of young English players, bags of talent and good character but it’s all about getting the chance and, as a goalkeeper, it’s even harder to be given that chance.

‘If Jak plays at Arsenal I’d have absolutely no worries about it. He’ll handle the occasion. In fact, he’ll relish it.’

Alnwick’s long-term future is complicated by the signing of Nottingham Forest goalkeeper Karl Darlow, who has remained at the City Ground on loan this season.

But Woodman has long since rated Alnwick as a top prospect.

‘I’ve been speaking highly about Jak for years,’ said the former Northampton netminder.

‘I tell people that when Jak eventually breaks onto the scene, they’re going to see a very good young goalkeeper.

‘He did his own prospects no harm at all against Chelsea.’

Meanwhile, Pardew added: ‘Jak deserves his chance, and he’s proven that.

‘Now it’s about earning a contract to be a professional footballer at Newcastle – not earning a contract in the summer at a lesser club.

‘He’s got a great opportunity, and he needs to take it.’
