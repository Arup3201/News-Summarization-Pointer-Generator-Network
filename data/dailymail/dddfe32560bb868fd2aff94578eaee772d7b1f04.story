Make it clear: The Labour leader said no more deals should be signed until a review had been carried out to ensure the firm was fit to provide services

Ed Miliband called today for G4S to be blocked from getting new Government contracts in the wake of the Olympics security shambles.

The Labour leader said no more deals should be signed until a review had been carried out to ensure the firm was fit to provide services.

He also accused the coalition of opening the door to private companies carrying out core police roles.

His attack came as Prime Minister David Cameron reiterated his vow to 'go after' G4S to make it repay the millions of pounds in extra costs incurred as a result of the fiasco.

G4S has rarely been out of the 
headlines since it admitted it had failed to employ enough staff 
to fulfill their £284million contract obligations.

As a result around 
3,500 troops have been parachuted in to help secure the Games as well as hundreds more police officers from forces around the country.

'People want bobbies on the beat, not G4S,' said Mr Miliband. 'We need to be much clearer about what private companies should and should not do.'

The comments came as Mr Miliband launched Labour’s campaign for Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) elections in central London.

He insisted it 'beggared belief' that G4S was trying to cling on to a £57 million management fee for Olympics security.

But he refused to call for the immediate resignation of chief executive Nick Buckles, suggesting the Games needed stability.

'Clearly the company will have serious questions to answer about new leadership (after) the Olympic Games,' Mr Miliband said.

In a humiliating appearance before MPs earlier this week, Mr Buckles admitted there would be financial consequences from the company’s failure to recruit enough staff.

But he dismissed the idea of giving up the multimillion-pound management charge.

Mr Miliband said: 'I don’t think G4S should receive their £57 million management fee for services provided to the Olympic games.

'Frankly it beggars belief that they think they are entitled to it.'

There is speculation that a request may be made today for up to 2,000 additional troops to plug any further gaps in security if G4S’s problems become more severe.

The Ministry of Defence, which has already upped its contribution by 3,500, said contingency plans were in place to increase the numbers again if necessary.

G4S is already involved in £600 million of private work for the Home Office alone, and had been hoping to increase its share of the market.

However, Mr Miliband said the security giant’s ambition must be put on hold.

'Before they are awarded any new policing contracts, we need a review of G4S’s ability to deliver,' he said.

Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband have stressed that they expect the Games to be a major success despite the problems as the row continues to overshadow the final build-up.

The Prime Minister has approved plans
to raise the number of military personnel deployed to protect the 
Olympics to 19,000 – double the number of troops now fighting in 
Afghanistan.

No 10 sources 
said the Government ‘will be very aggressive’ in reclaiming funds from 
G4S. Sports minister Hugh Robertson said lawyers have been deployed to 
trigger 'penalty clauses' in G4S's contract.

Speaking during a visit to Afghanistan, Prime Minister David Cameron said: 'If a company doesn't fulfil its contracts, then that company should be gone after for that money and that's exactly what's going to happen in the case of G4S.

'I think it's very important that we allow them to try and carry out the role that they are contracted to deliver.

'But of course the Government's interest, the interest of the Olympic Games, the interest of everyone in our country is to make sure that whatever it is necessary to do to deliver a safe and secure and successful Games is done.

'We've always had contingency plans in place to deliver just that. We activate those contingency plans as and when necessary to do that.

'But I couldn't be clearer - we will do what is necessary and contracts that aren't fulfilled will have consequences, including pretty tough financial consequences.

'I think G4S, in apologising for their performance, have already made clear that they realise that fact.'

Later, Jeremy Hunt sought to reassure Olympic ticket holders from around the world that the Games would be safe and secure.

When asked at an Olympic Park press conference if yesterday's bomb attack on a bus full of Israeli holidaymakers in Bulgaria presented extra security challenges to the Games, the Culture Secretary replied: 'Obviously we're monitoring the whole time what's happening with respect to the changing security situation.

'We have extremely competent intelligence services who are giving us advice and we're responding to that on an ongoing basis.

'But the world can be absolutely certain that we will deliver a safe and secure Olympics. It's always been our number one priority.'
