Former Chelsea manager Avram Grant is on the verge of being named Ghana head coach ahead of Spaniard Juan Ignacio Martinez and former Switzerland assistant coach Michel Pont.

The 59-year-old led Chelsea to the Champions League final in 2008, where they lost to Manchester United, and also managed the Israel national team for four years.

He will be appointed provided he is able to reach a financial agreement with the country's football association. 

Grant is a financial agreement away from being named the next head coach of Nigeria

The Israeli came within a penalty kick of winning the 2008 Champions League trophy with Chelsea

'If we reach an agreement with him we'll appoint him as Black Stars coach,' GFA boss Kwesi Nyantakyi told the BBC.

'If we don't reach an agreement with him, we'll look at our second option.' 

'We're going to engage Grant on the details of the job requirement and expectations which will span from remuneration, conditions of service and others,' Nyantakyi added.

'We are going to re-negotiate effectively. We know his salary expectation but we'd like to see if we can beat it down further.'

Grant will be charged with leading Ghana to a fifth African Cup of Nations title

The Israeli is set to replace James Kwesi Appiah who took charge of the Ghana team at the World Cup

The Black Stars have been without a coach since James Kwesi Appiah was replaced by Maxwell Konadu on a temporary basis after the opening two 2015 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers.

Konadu is set to oversee the remaining two qualifiers, away to Uganda on 15 November and then at home to Togo four days later, after taking the side to top of Group E.

Should Grant be appointed, he will be charged with winning Ghana their fifth Africa Cup of Nations title. 

Former Netherlands striker Patrick Kluivert, ex-German international Bernd Schuster and Italian Marco Tardelli were also shortlisted for the job but were never interviewed for different reasons.
