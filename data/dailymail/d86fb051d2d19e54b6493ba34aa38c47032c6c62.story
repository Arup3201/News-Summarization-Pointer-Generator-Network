This rare brown panda is walking proof that, when it comes to nature, it's not always a case of black and white.

Unlike his more common monochrome cousins, giant panda Qizai's coat is tan and brown.

The quirky creature is one of a rare subspecies that exists only in the remote Qinlig Mountains in western China.

Rare: Experts say giant panda Qizai is especially rare as his coat is entirely tan and brown - while some others in his colony have only odd brown patches in their fur

Subspecies: Qizai lives at the Shaanxi Wild Animal Research Centre in western China

Staff at the Shaanxi Wild Animal Research Centre, where the panda is cared for, say many others like him have only patches of brown in their fur - making Qizai especially rare.

'He has a totally brown and tan coat which is very rare. Most just have a few brown patches,' one keeper said.

Experts believe the colony of 300 pandas' unusual colouring is down a combination of a genetic mutation and the animals' local diet in the remote mountainous region.

'They only exist in the wild on these mountains and there are brown variants of other species in the area too,' the keeper said.
