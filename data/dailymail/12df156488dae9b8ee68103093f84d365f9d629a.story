The parents of the high school shooter who shot another student in the head before taking his own life issued a statement today saying that they could not fathom their son's actions.

Gunman Karl Pierson, 18, entered Arapahoe High School in Centennial, Colorado on Friday afternoon, targeting his debate coach Tracy Murphy.

He shot fellow student Claire Davis, 15, in the head at point-blank range with the pump-action shotgun he had legally purchased on December 6. She remains in a coma but in a critical but stable condition.

Gunman Karl Pierson, 18, entered Arapahoe High School in Centennial, Colorado on Friday afternoon, targeting his debate coach Tracy Murphy.

According to the Denver Post, his parents Barbara and Mark Pierson released a statement on Monday.

It read: 'We are shattered by 
the tragic events that took place on Friday at Arapahoe High School. Our
 thoughts and prayers are with Claire Davis and her family.

'They, and 
she, have suffered unimaginably, and we pray for her full recovery. We 
also pray for the entire Arapahoe High School community, as we know your
 lives are forever changed by this horrific event.

They added: 'As
 parents, we loved our son Karl dearly and we are devastated by what 
happened Friday. We cannot begin to understand why Karl did what he did.
 We ask for privacy during this unthinkably difficult time and hope that
 you will respect our need for time to grieve.'

Pierson died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, a coroner confirmed after he entered the school with the gun, straps of ammunition, a machete and three Molotov cocktails.

Claire Davis' parents also released a statement on the Littleton Adventist Hospital's Facebook page saying their daughter is in a critical but stable condition.

'The first responders got Claire to 
the right place, at the right time, and the doctors and hospital staff 
are doing a wonderful job taking care of her. We appreciate your 
continued good thoughts and prayers, and will provide updates as her 
condition improves.

'We 
again ask that you respect our wishes for privacy, and refrain from 
contacting us, our extended family, or Claire's friends and schoolmates,
 as we want to ensure that only accurate information about Claire is 
shared,' read the statement.

About 
500 classmates held a candlelight vigil Saturday for Davis, who was 
sitting with a friend near the school library when she was shot in the 
head.

Arapahoe County Sheriff Grayson Robinson has said investigators 
think she was shot at random by Pierson, who had gone into the school 
looking for a teacher with whom he had a dispute.

Community hope: Claire Davis' friends, classmates and family are all praying for her to survive
