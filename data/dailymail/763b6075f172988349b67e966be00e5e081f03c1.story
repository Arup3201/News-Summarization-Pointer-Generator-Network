President Obama made an appearance at the Grammys to deliver a plea for artists to inspire others to recognize and speak up against sexual violence.

'It's on us, all of us, to create a culture where violence isn't tolerated,' Obama said. 

'Where survivors are supported and where all our young people - men and women - can go as far as their talents and their dreams will take them.'

The president was plugging a campaign launched last fall by the White House called 'It's On Us,' urging Americans to take incidents of sexual assault on college campuses seriously.

PSA: President Obama made an appearance at the Grammys to deliver a plea for artists to inspire others to recognize and speak up against sexual violence

Survivor: Brooke Axtell, a survivor of domestic violence, spoke after President Obama as well as performing at the show

'Right now, nearly one in five women in America has been the victim of rape or attempted rape,' Obama said. 

'And more than one in four women has experienced some form of domestic violence.' 

A survey on sexual violence by the Centers for Disease Control released last year found that 19 percent of female respondents had experienced rape or attempted rape in their lives.

The same poll found nearly 2 percent of male respondents had been a victim of rape or attempted rape.  

The CDC's National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey from 2010 found that 30 percent of women had been slapped, shoved or pushed by a partner in her lifetime.

The survey also found that 24 percent had experienced severe physical violence at the hands of an intimate partner.

Obama urged viewers to 'take the pledge,' a promise to keep men and women safe from sexual assault and not to be a bystander, according to the campaign's website.

The president was followed by Brooke Axtell, who urged those victimized by domestic violence to seek help.

The 'It's On Us' campaign was launched in September, framing sexual violence as an act that destroys not only the victim's piece of mind, but their ability to pursue a meaningful education.

'For anybody whose once-normal, everyday life was suddenly shattered by an act of sexual violence, the trauma, the terror can shadow you long after one horrible attack,' the president said. 

The campaign launch was followed up with ads calling for more people to speak up against sexual assault, including one with actors such as Daniel Craig and Benicio Del Toro.
