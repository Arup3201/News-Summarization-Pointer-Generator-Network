The chip off the old Eubank block made his father proud but did not do quite enough on his own behalf to win a fight which was an epic of its class.

Billy Joe Saunders boxed the boy’s ears off in the first half of their grudge match and then survived a torrid last six rounds to hold onto this British, Commonwealth and European middleweight titles.

The ExCeL arena was rocking even more loudly than when Anthony Joshua was winning his super-heavyweight gold medal at the London Olympics.

On my card Saunders battled fairly safely to the finishing line, although the official judges had it close enough to give it to him on a split decision.

But some of the closing rounds were a wafer thin call between the skills of Saunders and the charging power of Chris Jnr.

Eubank was given something of a boxing lesson in the first six rounds and if he had been given that kind of education before he probably would have caused the upset his famous father expected.

As it, he finished this brutal night already the better for the experience and if these two collide again, which they surely will in the future, it could be a different ending.

However, Saunders proved his enormous courage in the closing stages to keep the more powerful Eubank just about at bay.

It was a magnificent clash of styles between the boxer and the powerful physical specimen. But Eubank will be regretting not going onto the attack earlier.

He spent the early rounds partly in posturing mode, trying to lure Saunders onto a one-punch KO but the champion was so accurate with his southpaw jab that he was able to land and nip away on most occasions.

And when Eubank came storming after him he still landed sharp punches of his own in contrast to Eubank’s hefty blows.

Eubank's arrival was reminiscent of how his father used to come among us – adopting a statuesque pose on the ring apron before vaulting over the ropes. Like Chris Snr was in imposing, muscular condition, while his dad was his familiar immaculate self, in elegantly black to match the boy's trunks. 

Eubank stood waiting in the corner at the first bell and Saunders obliged by crossing the ring to confront him, landing at once with his southpaw jab and continuing to do so through a lively first opening session in which he caught Eubank with some crisp rights, also

Saunders was resisting the temptation to be drawn into a brawl to Eubank's advantage. He used his more polished skills and again had the better of the more fiery exchanges. They taunted each other after one skirmish and then stood face to face at then of the round, which again went to Saunders.

Eubank was waiting to land the one big shot he needed to discourage Saunders and reinforce his own confidence – while his father stood erect and watching intently behind his corner. He did connect with a sharp left when they landed simultaneously his punch looked the heavier. But Saunders was unimpressed and went on to extend his early lead.

Eubank stood back in attempt to draw Saunders in but the champion bided his time before engaging and his southpaw jab was usually accurate enough to enable him to connect and escape.

Eubank's lunges looked raw in comparison with the experienced skills of Saunders and he had still to win a round.

The fifth was a messier stanza so not as clear cut. With so few punches landed neither man deserved to win it.

At times Eubannk was missing by yards. Saunders tried to embarrass him into advancing by barking 'come on.' Eubank made a gesture in that direction but too often ended up in a wrestling match. Saunders just edges it but the rounds are inching closer.

Whenever referee Michael Alexander was able to keep them apart Saunders landed. Eiubank had some success within the spasms of grappling and landed two good lefts to win his first round of what was becoming a very late night.

Eubank kept telling his opponent that he was not hurting him and there was no doubting his strength of chin as well as physique. The Eubannk cavalry charges ere beginning to have an effect and he shook Saunders twice at close quarters to close the gap a little further.

It was rough house now but Saunders rediscovered his range with some clever combinations. Even though Eubank shook his man with one pile-driver it was not enough to give him this one.

Saunders was boxing his way back into the ascendancy but still knew he was in a fight. Eubank came on strong to land a heavy right but Saunders opened up with lefts and right just before the bell to move within reaching distance of the finishing line.

Eubnank was warned for punching low, not for the first time. As they clinched again and again the issue was whether Saunders would weaken in the championship rounds. It was a war of attrition at this stage. Eubank was warned yet again for punching low, then slipped to the canvas as it ended.

On my card Eubank needed a knockout. He went for it in massive style and rocked Saunders twice. The effort was taking its toll on Eubank, also. It was an epic climax,with Saunders risking everything by standing his ground instead of keeping out of trouble, But he survived. Both men claimed the victory, with Eubank Snr congratuling his son. He had won the last battle but surely not the war.
