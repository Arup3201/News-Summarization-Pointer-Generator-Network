John O’Shea knows a thing or two about stability – he has been at the heart of the Republic of Ireland’s defence for 13 years and is set to win his 100th cap against world champions Germany.

But it is at club level where he is enjoying the settled surrounds of Sunderland manager Gus Poyet, who replaced firebrand Paolo Di Canio exactly one year ago.

O’Shea, like many of the squad, fell out with the Italian before his inevitable dismissal. Under Poyet, however, the 33-year-old is captain and a certain starter.

The Black Cats have lost just once in the Premier League this season and, after last year’s narrow escape from relegation, O’Shea is enjoying Poyet’s calming influence.

‘It is much more stable now and the club needed that,’ said the former Manchester United centre back.

‘The manager showed at Brighton that he knows what he is doing and the attitude of the gaffer and his staff is amazing.

‘They want the players to go on and improve and build themselves up individually and as a team. Hopefully we are doing that. The manager has built up a tight-knit squad.’

O’Shea will earn his 99th international cap against Gibraltar during Saturday’s Euro 2016 qualifier before his milestone match in Gelsenkirchen on Tuesday.

It is, though, a point of regret that only three of his caps have come at a major tournament, the European Championships in 2012 when Ireland crashed out at the group stage.

‘Statistics are there and they mean a lot but ultimately you want to be out there winning games,’ he said.

‘I have only been to one major tournament with Ireland so to get to the Euro finals with my country would be very special. That’s what I’m focussing on. It will be a big thing for the future of the young ones coming through as well, so we have got to try and get there.’

Of his potential landmark, he added: ‘My 100th cap could come against the world champions, so that’s a nice game for it to happen. I’d only be the sixth Irishman to do it as well.

‘It will be something I will look back on more when I have finished in the game and not playing. It will be special at the time for my family, friends, old clubs and a very proud moment.’

The only international tournament O'Shea played in with Ireland was the European Championships in 2012
