Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti has said he could leave the club if President Florentino Perez tries to influence first team matters.

Ancelotti told Spanish paper Marca that he trusts Perez to let him manage first team matters, but said 'If a President asked me to pick a player, I could leave'.

The Bernabeu boss also insisted that he has faith in under-fire goalkeeper Iker Casillas, and that the Spain legend will continue to play for Real.

Ancelotti believes his Real squad are stronger than last season, saying he is sure that Toni Kroos can fill Xabi Alonso's role, after the deep-lying midfielder departed for Bayern Munich this summer.

Elsewhere in Spain two goals for Luis Suarez on Uruguay duty have ramped up the excitement ahead of next week's Clasico. Mundo Deportivo quote Suarez on their front page saying 'If I only have to return for the Bernabeu then that's how it will be'.

In Italy the focus is on Southampton striker Graziano Pelle, who scored his first Italy goal on his international debut to give 'an ugly Italy' a 1-0 win over Malta. 

In Italy there is 'Graziano Pelle, and that's it'  while L'Equipe looks at the players France are missing

Meanwhile French paper L'Equipe highlight the players missing from Didier Deschamps' squad as they prepare for Euro 2016. 

The list includes Arsenal stars Olivier Giroud and Mathieu Flamini, Manchester City's Gael Clichy and Samir Nasri, and Hull's Hatem Ben Arfa.
