A woman in California killed four people and injured two others in an attack involving both a gun and a knife at a tribal office on a small American Indian settlement in norther California Thursday afternoon.

The attack reportedly happened during a meeting at Cedarville Rancheria Tribal
 Office and Community Center, where residents were discussing evicting the alleged shooter from her home on the settlement.

Alturas
 Police Chief Ken Barnes said 44-year-old Sherie Lash - a.k.a. Sherie Barnes - was taken into 
custody after allegedly opening fire at the community center in Alturas, about 55 miles south of the 
Oregon border and 35 miles west of the Nevada line.

Authorities tell KRCRTV that Lash - a former tribal leader - opened fire at the meeting about 3:30 p.m.

After killing four people, another victim was shot while running for the door. That victim was 'seriously wounded,' authorities say.

When she ran out of ammunition, Lash allegedly grabbed a butcher knife from the kitchen and attacked another person still inside the community center.

One witness managed to escape and run for the Alturas police station - while 'covered in blood' - to alert authorities.

When police got to the community center, they found Lash running out of the building with a knife. She was quickly subdued.
