 A three-year-old is in critical condition after falling into the jaguar pit at a zoo.

The child, whose name is being withheld by his family and authorities, was at the Little Rock Zoo in Little Rock, Arkansas, earlier today when he fell into the enclosure at around 10:45 am when a family member was holding the child on the railing.

Employees at the zoo responded immediately, holding off the cats with a fire extinguisher as they lowered a ladder and removed the child, who was conscious and responsive the entire time.

The child was then handed off to their father and rushed to a local hospital.

The child was taken to the hospital with extensive lacerations, a depressed skull fracture, and minor puncture wounds according to KTHV. 

It’s not clear if the injuries are from the 15-foot fall or one of the cats.

'We are treating a child here at Arkansas Children's Hospital who was injured earlier today at the Little Rock Zoo. The child's condition is critical,' said Dan McFadden of Arkansas Children's Hospital.

'We respect the wishes of the child's guardian who asked that the child's name and any additional information not be shared at this time. Thank you for respecting the privacy of this family.'

The most recent jaguar attack at a U.S. zoo happened in 2007 when zookeeper Ashlee Pfaff had her neck snapped by one of the animals at the Denver Zoo.

The third largest animals in the cat family, behind lions and tigers, and the largest native to the Americas, jaguars tend to attack their victims using the element of surprise.
