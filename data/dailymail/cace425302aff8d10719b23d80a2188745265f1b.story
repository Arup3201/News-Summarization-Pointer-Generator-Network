The war between Apple and Samsung shows no sign of abating, as the release date of iPhone 5 rumbles ever closer (albeit without confirmation from Apple itself) - and many of Samsung's products remain paralysed in legal limbo by Apple lawsuits.

Now it seems Samsung is going to strike back. 'We'll be pursuing our rights for this in a more aggressive way from now on,' Lee Younghee, head of global marketing for the company's mobile division said this week.

Younghee also said that Apple was 'free riding' on Samsung wireless technologies - lending credibility to rumours that Samsung would attempt to torpedo iPhone 5 before its European launch.

Too similar? Samsung's Galaxy touchscreens and iPhone are currently the subject of a bitter legal dispute in several countries

Ever since Apple launched its iPhone, 
it's been an open secret that Samsung makes many of the components 
inside it - in fact Samsung's CEO has admitted, 'Apple is our biggest 
customer.'

But ever since Samsung launched its 
own Galaxy series of phones and tablets - high-powered touchscreens 
whose flagship, the Galaxy S II, currently outpaces iPhone on the 
processing front - legal war has erupted between the companies in nine 
countries.

A Samsung executive told the Korea 
Times this week, 'When the iPhone 5 arrives here, Samsung plans to take Apple to 
court here for its violation of Samsung's wireless technology related 
patents.'

This is in 
response to Apple's continued legal action against Samsung's Galaxy 
family of touchscreen tablets and smartphones - some of which are 
currently illegal in Europe, thanks to Apple lawsuits claiming they are 'slavish' copies of iPhone and iPad.

Samsung recently overtook Nokia in 
the smartphone market, and its Galaxy S II offers a larger screen and 
faster processor than iPhone 4 - and has been a huge hit among geeky smartphone connoisseurs.

This month, Apple even forced Samsung to withdraw a prototype tablet device from the show floor of a Berlin electronics show. Samsung's larger Galaxy 10.1 tablet remains illegal in Europe thanks to Apple's legal action.

The Maeil Business Newspaper reported that the South Korean firm may seek an injunction against Apple's new iPhone in Europe. Samsung said it would not comment on ongoing legal issues.

Legal battle rages between Apple and Samsung over alleged 'similarities between their touchscreen smartphones and handsets

The two technology firms have been locked in intensifying legal battles in nine countries over their flagship smartphone and tablet products - battles made more complex by the fact that many related patents are held by other internet giants such as Google and Microsoft.

The latest attacks come after Apple successfully blocked Samsung from selling its latest tablets in Germany and some smartphone models in the Netherlands and forced its rival to delay launching new tablets in Australia.

After Apple's latest legal victory in Germany earlier this month, Samsung said it would take all available legal options.

Apple first sued Samsung in April, claiming its strongest competitor had 'slavishly' copied its product designs, and Samsung had since counter-sued, arguing Apple infringed on its mobile technologies.
