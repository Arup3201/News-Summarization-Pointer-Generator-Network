A pensioner had a finger cut off and was thrown down the stairs by his balaclava-wearing grandson during a botched burglary.

Barry Sibley was woken by the sound of intruders at his home and confronted them with a souvenir Gurkha’s knife.

However, in a 'ferocious and sickening' struggle, the two intruders wrestled the knife out of Mr Sibley's hands and turned it on him, slicing off the middle finger of his left hand and almost severing his ring finger. 

The 82-year-old was then pushed down the stairs before the pair followed him, stabbed him in the chest and ‘chopped’ about his head with the ornamental kukri. They fled empty-handed.

A police investigation revealed the retired policeman’s grandson, Jack Sibley, 21, and an accomplice, 22-year-old Warren Reid, were behind the raid.

The pair broke into Mr Sibley's home in Cheshunt in May 2014 and subjected him to a terrifying ordeal 

His mother Lorraine, Mr Sibley's daughter-in-law, received a 12 month sentence after lying to police about how her son had cut his hand.  

Sibley and his accomplice planned to steal £4,000 from a safe kept in an upstairs wardrobe before going on a spending spree which included visiting a strip club.

Sibley – who visited his grandfather in hospital after the attack - has now been jailed for 19 years. Warren Reid, 22, was given 19 years and nine months.

Both blamed each other for the horrific injuries Mr Sibley suffered. Surgeons were unable to re-attach the severed finger but saved the other one. He was in hospital for about a week. 

Mr Sibley, who has six grandchildren told The Mirror: 'Jack visited me in hospital with his family. He didn't say a word to me - he just sat at the bottom of my bed. 

'At that time I didn't know it was him so it came as a surprise when police told me. That was very callous. He was trying to prove he was innocent by visiting me in hospital. I'm glad he's going to jail for a long time, at least I should be able to sleep safely.' 

He added: 'I have had no contact with him and he hasn't apologised. Apparently Jack sent a letter to the judge saying how sorry he was but I diddn't receive anything. I haven't forgiven him. They left me for dead.'

A friend said he was ‘shaken to the core’ by his ordeal in the early hours of May 13 last year and ‘gutted’ about the impact on his family.

In a recorded interview played at St Albans Crown Court, the pensioner said: ‘Everywhere was in complete darkness.

‘I opened the bedroom door and stepped out onto the landing. These two people jumped me and the next thing I know there was a struggle and they wrenched the knife out of my hand.

‘The next thing I knew I was head first down the stairs. What happened after that was a complete blank until I came round at the bottom of the stairs.’

St Alban's Crown Court, pictured, heard the pair made a 'reconnaissance mission' two days before the raid

Detectives quickly established Sibley, of Stevenage, and Reid, of Luton, had made a surprise visit to the house two days before the raid.

Prosecutor Michael Speak told the jury it was actually a ‘reconnaissance’ mission. Sibley kept his grandfather occupied while his partner crept upstairs.

Text messages on the men’s phones revealed they were planning the burglary and that they intended using some of the proceeds on the strip club in Luton.

They had also visited websites to gather information about unlocking combination safes.

On the night of the burglary the men let themselves in with a spare key Sibley had and were creeping upstairs when they woke his grandfather.

Mr Sibley also suffered a fractured skull in the attack. His cries for help were heard by a neighbour and police broke into the property where they found him lying in a pool of blood.

Both men were convicted of conspiring to rob in a trial that ended last month. They had already admitted conspiracy to burgle.

They were acquitted of attempted murder but found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with intent.

Both were also convicted of attempting to pervert the course of justice – Reid for hiding a knife and Sibley for burning the balaclava and gloves he wore.

They were sentenced last Friday but reporting was prevented until yesterday for legal reasons.

Judge Stephen Gullick told them: ‘He [Mr Sibley] was disarmed of the knife and such was the force of the struggle that, in the course of his resistance, one finger on his left hand was traumatically amputated and another finger was almost severed.

‘He was then propelled head-first down the stairs. The two of you followed.

‘One of you had the knife. Which one of you it was, only you know since each of you has always blamed the other for what occurred thereafter.

‘The jury concluded that what happened was the product of a joint enterprise by the pair of you for which you were equally responsible.’

Sibley’s mother, Lorraine, 48, was also jailed for 12 months after lying to police about cuts on his hand. The teaching assistant claimed they were caused by broken glass in her home.

The court heard her 23-year marriage to her husband Alan – Mr Sibley’s son – had ended as a result.
