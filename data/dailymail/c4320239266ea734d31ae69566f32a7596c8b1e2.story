After their Olympic colleagues gave the nation the feelgood factor earlier this month, today Britain's Paralympians showcased their talents ahead of the Opening Ceremony next week.

On the day the Paralympic torch relay visited London landmarks including the Royal Opera House and Trafalgar Square, Great Britain's Women's wheelchair basketball stars put their skills on display in the unusual setting of St Paul's Cathedral.

With the London Paralymics just five days away, Britain is again preparing to catch Olympic fever in the event which David Cameron promised would deliver 'spectacular sport'.

After watching marathon heroine Claire 
Lomas light the Paralympic cauldron in Trafalgar Square, the Prime 
Minister said we were in for an 'incredible' Games.

Speaking in Trafalgar Square, Mr Cameron said: 'The Olympic Games made our country proud. I believe these Paralympic Games will make our country prouder still.

'Already this is shaping up to be the best, the biggest, the most incredible Paralympic Games ever.'Over these next two weeks, we're going to have more of those moments that will bring us together and make us proud.

'We are going to show the whole world that when it comes to putting on a show, there is no country like Britain and no city like London.'

Torchbearers will also carry the flame to see performers preparing for this weekend’s Notting Hill Carnival and take a trip on the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) as it travels around the capital.

Today started with the cauldron being lit in Trafalgar Square by Claire Lomas, who became the first person to complete a marathon in a bionic suit earlier this year.

Ms Lomas, who was left paralysed from the chest down following a horse riding accident in 2007, walked the London Marathon route in a pioneering robotic suit raising £204,000 for Spinal Research.

She will light the cauldron using the flame that was created at Scafell Pike.

Three other Paralympic flames were struck by Scouts on the summits of the highest peaks of the home nations on Tuesday.

As well as Scafell Pike in England, 
they were lit on Snowdon in Wales, Ben Nevis in Scotland and Northern 
Ireland’s Slieve Donard.

The
flames will rest at Paralympic celebrations in Belfast, Edinburgh and 
Cardiff along with London before heading to Stoke Mandeville, where they
will be united during a special ceremony on August 28 before a 24-hour 
relay to the opening of the Games at the Olympic Stadium takes place.

As the start of the Games draws nearer, 
today will also see the Agitos, the official symbol of the 2012 
Paralympics, be suspended from Tower Bridge, where it will remain until 
September 15.

Marking the lighting of the cauldron 
in Trafalgar Square, Prime Minister David Cameron said he was looking 
forward to an 'incredible' Games.

He
said: 'After a fortnight of Olympics withdrawal symptoms, it’s time to 
dust off the GB flags and get ready for two more weeks of spectacular 
sport. The London Paralympic Games 2012 are finally here.

'We can’t deny there’s something particularly inspiring about the Paralympics.

The official emblem of the Paralympics, the Agitos, made its debut on the underside of Tower Bridge earlier this week

'Why? Because being a Paralympian 
takes an extra measure of guts and steel. A lot of the athletes arriving
in London would have been told from a young age about everything they 
can’t do - and they decided to throw everything into what they can do, 
whether that’s smashing a ball over the net, running on prosthetics or 
swimming faster than the rest.

'That
example - of overcoming the difficulties you’ve been handed, pushing 
yourself to the limits, going way beyond the expectations others have 
set for you - is truly inspiring.

'So
I want to wish everyone competing in these Games - and particularly 
ParalympicsGB - the best of luck. The whole country will be cheering you
on.'

London Mayor Boris 
Johnson said: 'With just five days to go, London is ready to make 
history and host the most successful Paralympic Games ever seen.

'So get involved, get out on the 
streets and show your support as the Paralympic Flame, and all the 
incredible endeavours it represents, makes its way through London.'

The
day will also see celebrations taking place in Plymouth as the city’s 
flame ambassador, 14-year-old wheelchair athlete Doaa Shayea, and the 
city’s Lord Mayor will take part in a procession after returning by 
train from the ceremony in Trafalgar Square.

And later the name of the flagbearer for ParalympicsGB during the opening ceremony of the Games will also be announced.

Meanwhile, Buckingham Palace today confirmed that Prince Philip will miss the Paralympic opening ceremony as he continues to recover from a bladder infection.

Philip was due to attend with the Queen on Wednesday when she officially opens the ceremony but will instead remain at the family’s private Balmoral estate in Scotland.

A Palace statement said he 'continues to recover well' following the recurrence of the infection.

Philip was released from Aberdeen Royal Infirmary earlier this week after five nights in hospital.
