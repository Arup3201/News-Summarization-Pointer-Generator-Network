Bungling council workers have ruined historic cobblestones in a picturesque market town for the second time with clumsily painted yellow lines. 

People living in Stamford, Lincolnshire - dubbed 'England's most attractive town' by poet John Betjeman - were horrified when they first discovered the messy lines smeared across the stones in St Mary's Place last November.

The paint had ran into the cracks of the stones - which were laid in the Georgian era - leaving them covered in unsightly, thick, yellow dollops.

Failed again: People complained to Lincolnshire County Council after it attempted to paint yellow lines on the cobblestones in November (left). However, its second attempt (right) has not been much better

Highway workers from Lincolnshire County Council were forced to remove the first set of wobbly lines after a string of complaints.

But just two months later, the replacement lines have also failed to stick to the cobbles - leaving another mess on the town's important landmark.

Red-faced council workers used an experimental paint for the second job but it started peeling within a week.

James Tweedle, 33, who lives nearby, said: 'It's absolute incompetence from the council. 

'Surely if you get professionals in they should realise that liquid will run around obstacles like cobbles?

Messy: Residents were furious after council workers ruined the Georgian cobbled streets in Stamford with clumsily painted yellow lines. Staff at Lincolnshire County Council were forced to remove them

What a mess: But the council did it again with this failed attempt which has resulted in the paint peeling away from the historic cobblestones in Stamford, Lincolnshire

'Then they used our taxpayers money to redo the job and they get it wrong again. 

'After messing it up the first time, I can't believe they used something experimental.

'Stamford is known for its old-fashioned cobbled streets but these people have made us a laughing stock. It looks ridiculous.' 

Liz Heesom, 20, who lives in the town, added: 'This beautiful medieval church precinct has been spoiled by the careless and unsightly ladling out of thick yellow paint.

'It's bad enough messing it up once but twice is unforgivable.'

Ruined: Stamford residents say the yellow paint has destroyed the historic streetscape twice

Tourist favourite: Visitors flock to the historic market town all year round, drawn by the period architecture and specialist shops. But residents say the messy yellow lines ruin the pretty Stamford street

Brian Thompson, head of Highways West at Lincolnshire County Council, has since been forced to apologise to the people of Stamford.

He said: 'We know that Stamford's cobbled streets are an important landmark for its residents and visitors alike.

'We also want to protect its appearance by ensuring that parking restrictions are enforced in the area.

'However, applying the usual methods of laying yellow lines with liquid paint is difficult on this tricky surface.

'We used these lines as a trial to assess their durability here. 

'As it hasn't worked, we're already looking into alternative solutions and will get these in place as soon as we possibly can.'

The BBC filmed George Eliot's Middlemarch in the town, which was also the setting for scenes in Another Country, starring Rupert Everett and Colin Firth.

Stamford's George Hotel was an important coaching inn in the 17th and 18th centuries and still enjoys huge popularity with visitors today. 

Noted guests have included King Charles I, William III, and Sir Walter Scott.
