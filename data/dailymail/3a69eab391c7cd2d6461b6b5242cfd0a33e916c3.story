From the highest peaks of the Himalayas to the afterglow of the Big Bang, this incredible sequence takes the viewer on a captivating journey through the known universe.

In a vertigo-inducing sequence, the video zooms out from Earth showing the orbit of satellites, the sun and the solar system before revealing the extent of humanities first radio signals.

Moving further out, it flies the viewer on a rapid journey across Milky Way galaxy, galaxies nearby, distant galaxies, and finally quasars, which offer scientists a glimpse into the origins of the universe.

From the highest peaks of the Himalayas (pictured) to the afterglow of the Big Bang, this incredible sequence takes the viewer on a captivating journey through our known universe

As the distant surface of the microwave background is finally reached, radiation is depicted that was emitted billions of light years away and less than one million years after the Big Bang.

Every star, planet, and quasar seen in this sequence has been mapped to scale by the world’s most complete four-dimensional map of the universe, the Digital Universe Atlas.

‘The light from these distant galaxies have taken so long, we're essentially backing up into the past,’ said Carter Emmart, Director of Astrovisualisation at the American Museum of Natural History.

The items in this video have been mapped to scale by the Digital Universe Atlas.

The Atlas is maintained and updated by
 astrophysicists at the American Museum of Natural History.

It is 
available as a free open source software for planetariums and amateur 
astronomers.

It was created as part of a 
long-running exhibition at the museum, titled ‘Visions of the Cosmos: 
From the Milky Ocean to an Evolving Universe’.

‘We back so far up we're finally seeing a containment around us - the afterglow of the Big Bang.’

‘What the world needs now is a sense of being able to look at ourselves in this much larger condition now and a much larger sense of what home is,’ said Mr Emmart during a TED talk.

‘Our home is the universe, and we are the universe, essentially. We carry that in us.

‘And to be able to see our context in this larger sense at all scales helps us all, I think, in understanding where we are and who we are in the universe.’
