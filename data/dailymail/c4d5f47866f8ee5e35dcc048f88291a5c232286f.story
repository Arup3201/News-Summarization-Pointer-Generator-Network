A £500,000-a-year broker lost an unfair dismissal lawsuit against his firm - after a judge ruled he gave ‘often gave worse than he got’ on a trading floor rife with ‘homophobic, racist and sexist’ insults.

Robert Bou-Simon, who worked for BGC Partners in Canary Wharf, east London, was ‘not the only object of ridicule and insult or the sole victim of the abuse’, an employment tribunal judge said.

Conversations between staff on instant messenger services were often abusive, but the comments were seen as ‘banter - a word which seems to cover a multitude of sins,’ according to the judge.

The Australian, who was head of the US firm's basis swaps desk, had claimed the bullying began when he refused to take part in an initiation ritual after he joined the company in February 2012.

This was known as ‘The Run’ and involved sprinting across the office after making a first trade while colleagues doused him in water, reported Bloomberg journalist Kit Chellel.

He claimed colleagues forced him to quit in June 2013 following a campaign of bulling - and Anthony Herbert, who would go on to replace him, had written in a message: ‘I’m going to destroy Bob.’

The tribunal in May this year was also told how Mr Bou-Simon claimed to have been victimised and taunted about his support for Chelsea Football Club and an Australian rugby team.

But Judge Bernice Elgot said that because desk revenue had fallen under Mr Bou-Simon’s leadership, he had ‘exposed himself to a lack of respect in this particular working culture’.

She also found that colleagues were ‘disillusioned’ with him because he bullied junior brokers, reported Daily Telegraph journalist Claire Duffin.

And it turned out that Mr Bou-Simon also took part in using ‘personally insulting and obscene language towards others’ on the instant message service.

Mr Bou-Simon was hired on a salary of £500,000, which was later halved to £250,000 after he failed to live up to a promise that he would ‘turn one million dollars a month’.

The judge said his employment ‘did not work out’ and there were ‘high expectations on both sides’.

Mr Bou-Simon had also worked for BGC from 2000 to 2005 but left in ‘difficult’ circumstances. He then worked for GFI Brokers before returning to BGC. He now works for Vantage Capital Markets.

He has previously lived in a two-bedroom penthouse in Fulham, south-west London, worth £1.15million, and a modern building in the City of London where flats go for up to £900,000.

The tribunal was held at the East London Hearing Centre in Poplar in May, and the ruling released last week. A spokesman for BGC did not immediately respond to MailOnline's request for comment.
