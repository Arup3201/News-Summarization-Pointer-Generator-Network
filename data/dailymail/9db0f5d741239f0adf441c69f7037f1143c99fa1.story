Kit Kats, Tiny Teddies, Smarties and Coco Pops are being classified as healthy foods by food companies' standards so they can bypass regulations to be advertised to young children.

A NSW Cancer Council study found food companies were setting their nutrition criteria low enough to sidestep non-mandatory codes regulating advertising junk food to kids.

Coco Pops uses a 30 gram serving as the basis for its sugar content - a portion much less than what most people would consume in a normal breakfast bowl, reported the Sydney Morning Herald.

The analysis found 63 per cent of food advertised on TV was classed as unhealthy by Food Standards Australia New Zealand.

Researchers looked at TV food advertisements aired between 6am and 9pm over two weeks.

Study author Clare Hughes said 39 per cent of food advertisements that met the companies' own criteria for healthy food failed the government's criteria.

Fast foods including McDonald's Chicken N' Cheese burger and KFC's Mint Choc Krusher are being advertised to children despite not being children's meals.

The findings, published in industry journal Nutrition and Dietetics, showed companies which signed a voluntary industry-regulated marketing code breached this by showing foods classified as unhealthy by government standards.

But companies which had not signed the code tended to advertise healthier foods.

The Responsible Children's Marketing Initiative is a voluntary system which many food companies also follow.

The initiative allows food companies to create a nutrition criteria to work out which foods should be advertised to kids.

Unhealthy foods are prevented from being advertised to children from 7am to 8.30am and 4pm to 8.30pm from Monday to Friday and 7am to 8.30pm on weekends, by the Australian Communications Media Authority.

The study has sparked calls for mandatory regulation in line with government standards

Ms Hughes said this would be more effective in stopping high-sugar and fat foods being marketed to children rather than relying on food companies to comply with voluntary codes and self-regulation.

'The voluntary initiatives can be a bit of an advertising spin in themselves,' Ms Hughes said. 'Children are watching television at times when these initiatives don't apply.'

Yet Australian Food and Grocery Council spokesman James Mathews said advertising bans overseas had not shown any drop in childhood obesity rates.

He questioned the basis of the research looking at advertising during all shows between 6am to 9am, including Law and Order and movies featuring sex and violence, which are not targeted at children.Â 

The NSW Cancer Council campaigns against junk food advertising to children because of the associated cancers linked with obesity, such as kidney, bowel, pancreas, post-menopausal breast, endometrial and esophegal cancer.
