A judge on Friday revoked the bail of George Zimmerman and ordered him to return to jail within 48 hours after berating the neighbourhood watch captain and his wife for falsely testifying to his court.

Safe in a secure location outside Florida since his release on bail in April, Zimmerman will now have to return to jail in the Sunshine State and await his trial for the second-degree murder of unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin.

This comes as it emerged that Zimmerman had $135,000 available that had been raised by a website he set up to pay for his reduced bond even though Zimmerman's wife, Shellie, testified at the bond hearing in April that they had limited funds available.

As he revoked Zimmerman's bail on Friday, the judge said Mr Zimmerman had responsibilities to stop his wife, who testified at one hearing, and 
his lawyer from making false statements.

'Mr Zimmerman can't sit back a potted palm and let his wife 
testify falsely before the court when he knew well in advance of the 
hearing the amounts of money in controversy,' said Judge Kenneth Lester.

'He can't sit back and obtain the 
benefit of a lower bond based upon those material falsehoods.'

Under Florida's Rules of Criminal Procedure, a judge has discretion to revoke a defendant's bail if he finds there's 'good cause' to do so.

Lying to a court about one's finances apparently fits the bill.

In arguing for George Zimmerman's bail to be revoked, prosecutors asserted his wife Shelly 'flat-out lied' to get a lower bail.

'This
court was led to believe that [George Zimmerman and his wife] didn't 
have a single penny,' one prosecutor argued.

But it turns out the 
Zimmermans had collected about $200,000 in online donations via a 
website -- a fact Zimmerman's attorney Mark O'Mara has acknowledged.

In
addition, Zimmerman and his wife 'spoke in code to hide what they were 
doing' during jail telephone calls, prosecutors alleged.

Prosecutors also used phone 
conversations recorded between Zimmerman and 
his wife Shelly, to show that the pair intentionally deceived the court 
by talking in code that designates multiples of thousands to much lower 
sums.

Defense attorney Mark O'Mara said the fact that Zimmerman and his wife never used the money for anything indicated 'there was no deceit.' Since his release in late April, Zimmerman has been staying at an undisclosed location for his safety.

Prosecutor Bernie De la Rionda described the Zimmermans' testimony as 'misleading'.

'This court was led to believe they didn't have a single penny,' said De la Rionda. 'It was misleading and I don't know what words to use other than it was a blatant lie.'

The judge said he 
would schedule a hearing after Zimmerman is back in custody so the 
neighborhood watch leader could explain himself.

It was also revealed that Zimmerman kept a second passport at his home and he and his wife can be heard to discuss it.

'I have one for you in the safety deposit box,' said Shellie.

'Okay, you hold onto that,' replied Zimmerman.

Zimmerman is 
pleading not guilty to second-degree murder and claims self-defense. 
Zimmerman shot Martin in February during a confrontation at a gated 
community of townhouses in Sanford, Fla., where Zimmerman lived and 
where the 17-year-old Martin was visiting his father's fiancee.

Benjamin Crump, an attorney for Trayvon Martin's parents, Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton, said his clients have always said Zimmerman should remain in jail until trial, which O'Mara said he believed wouldn't be until next year.

Crump was asked if he thought that if Zimmerman would be willing to lie about his finances that he would be willing to lie about what happen the night Martin was killed.

'We fully expect that the special prosecutor will make George Zimmerman's credibility be front and center in this entire case,' Crump said. 'And whatever dishonesty that comes forth by George Zimmerman that they can prove, you can best believe it will be the issue of this case and rightfully so.

Prosecutors also said Zimmerman had failed to surrender a second passport, but the judge dismissed that concern as the equivalent of someone who has lost a driver's license, applies for a new one and then finds the old driver's license.

The delay in an arrest for 44 days prompted protests nationwide and led to Sanford's police chief stepping aside so emotions could cool down.

At Friday's court hearing, De la 
Rionda and O'Mara also asked a judge to stop the public release of 
witness names and statements made by Zimmerman to police officers. Those
documents normally are part of the public record under Florida law.

George Zimmerman started a website to raise funds for his legal defence under the URL www.therealgeorgezimmerman.com in April.

‘I have created a Paypal account solely linked on this website as I would like to provide an avenue to thank my supporters personally and ensure that any funds provided are used only for living expenses and legal defence,’ he posted on the website in April

According to prosecutors, he allegedly raised $135,000 but the website was shut down on April 24 so his attorney could regain control of the fundraising drive.

The 28-year-old's bond hearing was on April 20, where the amount of money the website had raised was not disclosed.

Zimmerman was released from jail on April 23 on a $150,000 bond after paying 10 per cent upfront.

Later that week, his lawyer told CNN that the website had raised more than $200,000 in donations.

'What's
occurring, unfortunately, are cases are being tried in the public 
sector as opposed to in the courtroom,' De La Rionda said. 'We are in a 
new age with Twitter, Facebook, and all these things I've never heard of
before in my career. Everybody gets to find out intimate details about 
witnesses that never occurred before. Witnesses are going to be 
reluctant to get involved.'

A consortium of more than a dozen media groups, including The Associated Press, asked the judge to ignore the request, saying such records are presumed to be publicly available under Florida law.

Rachel Fugate, an attorney for the Orlando Sentinel, cited the Casey Anthony trial as an example of a highly publicized case in which a jury was able to be seated despite intense media coverage. The Florida mother was acquitted last year of killing her 2-year-old daughter.

'Discovery in Florida has traditionally been open ... and Florida hasn't encountered problems seating juries and giving defendants fair trials,' Fugate said.

O'Mara said Friday on a website that he doesn't expect the case to be ready for trial until next year.

O'Mara said he expects to call on 50 witnesses who need to be deposed before he decides whether to file a "stand your ground" motion which would ask for a hearing before a judge without a jury. At the hearing, Zimmerman would argue self-defense under the Florida law which gives wide latitude to use deadly force rather than retreat in a fight if people believe they are in danger of being killed or seriously injured.
