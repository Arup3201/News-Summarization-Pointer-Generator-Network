Killed: Austin Haley was killed six years ago when he was shot accidentally by a police officer who meant to kill a snake

One of the former police officers found guilty in the 2007 shooting death of a five-year-old boy has had his record expunged.

Austin Haley was killed in 2007 when he was shot accidentally by a police officer who meant to kill a snake.

But now his shooter, Paul Brad Rogers, has had his record have expunged six years after the incident in Noble, Oklahoma.

His heartbroken parents have spoken out 
about their anger after hearing the news.

Austin had been fishing with his grandfather Jack Tracy when two Noble police officers were called to a home on a report of a large snake, reported KFOR.TV.

Paul Bradley Rogers fired two shots from
his 357 at the snake which was dangling from a wooden birdhouse.

Both bullets missed the snake and one struck the child who 
was in the woods.

Austin’s
father, Jack told the website: 'I hate to dredge this up again. But 
here we are six years later, and we’re finding out the shooter, Brad 
Rogers, his records have been expunged.'

Both Robert Shawn Richardson and Paul Bradley Rogers pleaded guilty to second-degree manslaughter.

Difficult: Austin's father, Jack said: 'Six years later, and we're finding out the shooter, Brad Rogers, his records have been expunged'

Richardson received a 5-year deferred sentence, and Rogers received two and a half.

The Cleveland County DA, Greg Mashburn told KFOR.TV ,'providing all requirements were met on the deferred sentence, the case could be updated to say 'pled not guilty, case dismissed.'

The family have been left horrified by the law. 

Austin's father fears the former 
officer may get back into law enforcement, and be able to carry a gun 
now that his record has been expunged, reported News9.
