Demands: It was alleged that David Laws demanded Cornish minority status in return for another policy

The decision to recognise the Cornish as a minority group was the result of ‘petty’ horse-trading over policies between the coalition parties, senior Tories claimed last night.

Amid deepening tensions, it was claimed the Liberal Democrat minister David Laws - one of Nick Clegg’s closest allies – demanded the move in return for signing off another policy.

The Lib Dems are said to have refused to agree to reforms of town hall pensions, which could save taxpayers up to £600million a year, unless the Cornwall announcement was made.

Cornish people were granted the same rights and protections as other ‘national minorities’ in the surprise move last month.

Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander unveiled the plan on a visit to Bodmin. It appeared to be part of an effort by the to shore up faltering support in the South West, traditionally one of the party’s strongholds.

The claim that it was part of yet more ‘horse-trading’ will add to growing concern among senior Tories that government is being reduced to ‘transactional’ deal-making with their coalition colleagues.

Last night a Cabinet source identified Mr Laws as a significant problem for relations between the two parties. Conservative ministers did not disagree with the proposal for Cornwall, but thought it bizarre that Mr Laws apparently sought to link it to a major austerity measure.

‘You can do a deal with Danny [Alexander]. He will do what he says he’s going to do. But I have never come across a more tricky politician than David Laws,’ said the Cabinet source.

‘You wouldn’t believe the horse-trading that we have to do and how silly some of the gimmicks that they want are.’

Tory Cabinet ministers are rallying to the support of Education Secretary Michael Gove, who has been embroiled in increasingly bitter public disputes with the Lib Dems in recent weeks.

Yesterday the Daily Mail revealed Mr Clegg twice suggested police should be brought in to investigate damaging leaks about his plans to extend free school meals, which he blamed on Dominic Cummings – a former senior aide to Mr Gove.

Deal: The Cornish are now a minority under an EU convention, and the Cornish language receives state funding

Ministers insist problems are not limited to Mr Gove’s department, but are increasingly happening elsewhere.

One example, the source said, was the Communities and Local Government Department’s bid to make vital savings in the management of town hall pensions. Ministers agreed to bring in a bank or actuarial firm to cut huge administration costs, which vary greatly across almost 90 local government retirement schemes.

But the Lib Dems insisted on the Cornish announcement in exchange for agreeing to the reforms, the source claimed.

The Cornish have been afforded the status of a national minority, made under a European convention.

Only 557 people claim Cornish is their main language, but teaching of the dialect is receiving government funding.

It emerged yesterday Mr Clegg has asked Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood, to issue a formal warning to Mr Cummings about his duty of confidentiality.

Mr Cummings said he was prepared to repeat his allegations against the Deputy Prime Minister ‘under oath’. He accused Mr Clegg of lying about funding of free school meals for pupils aged five, six and seven.

A Lib Dem spokesman said: ‘It’s in the nature of coalitions that negotiations happen and David Laws has the role of leading those talks for us every week.’
