Facebook has cornered the market for a surprising new demographic - the Amish.

The social networking site has become one of the must-have accessories for thousands of Amish teens during their Rumspringa years - when they cast off their parents' rules and experiment with technology, popular culture, alcohol and even sex and drugs.

Facebook has become a way for Amish teens to meet other Amish, organize parties and brag to their friends about their new 'English' (non-Amish) haircuts, and lifestyle.

Selfie in a bonnet? The idea of even sitting for a photograph would unsettle most Amish. But teens on Rumspringa post pictures of themselves - just like teens in the modern world

Getting together: Teens use Facebook to date - but usually only other Amish. Rumpsringa is often seen by elders as a time to find a spouse

Strange: The marriage of Amish, cell phones and Facebook made this entirely bizarre post possible. This teen has apparently borrowed his father's horse and buggy to go meet his friends

'They love the stuff, but they don’t have a lot of experience with it,' Chris Weber, who counsels Amish teens about drug and alcohol abuse, told BuzzFeed. 

Facebook and smartphones allow many Amish teens to fall into the same patterns of social media use as their non-Amish peers.

They post 'selfie' photos, images of their drunken friends at parties and pictures of themselves in non-Amish clothes.

For most Amish, even sitting for a photograph is considered prideful and not in keeping with the rules of the community.

Social media has also allowed for massive booze-fueled parties.

Noah Hershberger, 22, who recently left the Amish, says teens have gotten smart about not posting details about parties on Facebook because they know cops could be reading.

'There are a lot of underagers, so they will forward a text message around with the address, time, and whatever of the party,' he told BuzzFeed.

Because Facebook allows Amish teens to dramatically widen their social circles. A party that might have attracted a few dozen teens from a few neighboring farm communities now draws hundreds - sometimes from different states.

'We used to have parties, but it was not this easy to find them. Now it doesn’t take long to set it up and 700 kids show up. Everyone is connected, everyone is texting everyone,' Weber said.

Sex remains to verboten topic - even on Facebook. Hershberger says teens still look at online pornography and they often troll dating sites like MeetMe.com. However, this is usually not talked about.

Rumspringa has been portrayed in popular culture as a hedonistic time of no-holds-barred partying for Amish teens.

The rite of passage - usually between age 14 and 16 - allows young Amish to experience the outside world, including technology, and defy the rules of their parents.

However, most teens never actually leave home on Rumspringa, and the vast majority decide to join the church and stay with the Amish community when Rumspringa ends.

It is true the Amish teens often drink alcohol at parties - usually with their parents' knowledge. Some experiment with sex and illegal drugs.

Most Amish boy and girls, though, live at home during Rumpsringa and only party on the weekends.

When they do party, it is nearly always with other Amish on Rumspringa.

Even with vast new-found freedom, many Amish teens can't bear to stray far from home or from their traditional values.

Ironically, Facebook expands the world for most Amish teens - but only opens it enough so they can meet other Amish.

Most Amish teens on Rumspringa aren't interested in dating non-Amish or even necessarily socializing with them.

Largely, Facebook has became a way for Amish teens to meet other Amish teens.

'It serves [as] an insulating social 
network - one more way that Amish youth socialize only with other Amish 
youth - rather than a means of expanding Amish social circles,' Steve 
Nolt, a professor a Goshen College in Indiana who studies the Amish, 
told the Lancaster Sunday News in 2011.

Most Amish teens use smartphones - iPhones are the most coveted - because they can be easily charged using solar power strips. 

Contrary to popular belief, most teens on Rumspringa still live with their parents, meaning it's not feasible to own computers.

Despite the very modern obsession 
with social networking, photography and meeting people online, there is 
one place Amish teens draw the line - video games.

The teens who become obsessed with Farmville or Angry Birds are ridiculed.

'They kind of think it is stupid. They are very practical; they think it is childish,' Weber, the Amish counselor, said.

Rumspringa, which takes place for 
teens between ages 14 and 16 in most Amish communities, is seen as a 
time of courtship. However, it is also a time when teens are free of 
their parents rules.

At the 
end of Rumspringa, the teens must choose whether to be Baptized as Amish
as rejoin the community or whether to abandon their families and way of
life for the modern world.

The vast majority of teens choose the Amish life.

One Amishman in Lancaster County, 
Pennsylvania, said Amish youths have always been curious about trying 
new technologies. Facebook is just the latest.

'When automobiles came out, some 
Amish rode in automobiles. When Rollerblades became popular, some Amish 
Rollerbladed. Most anything that comes along, some Amish kids will pick 
it up,' the man told the Lancaster Sunday News.

There is some evidence that Facebook has an even wider use among Amish youths than just those teens on Rumspringa.

Cell phones have recently come into 
use in Amish businesses and some more liberal bishops have allowed their
members to use social media to market their shops and wares.

There is no way to cell for certain how many Amish kids are on Facebook, but some church leaders have begun to speak out against the site.

'This is something no proper Amish would endorse. Kids can get themselves in trouble,' a Lancaster County Amishman told the Sunday News.

Part of the problem with Facebook and cell phone use among young Amish - whether on Rumspringa or not - is that parents and older leaders in the community have a difficult time fathoming the technology and how it really works.
