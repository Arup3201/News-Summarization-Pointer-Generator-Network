'I don't believe it': Grumpy grandads such as Victor Meldrew, played by Richard Wilson, appear to be on the decline as more aging men say their later years are the best of their lives

Women are grumpier than men when they reach old age, a survey reveals today.

The nationwide research appears to challenge the idea of men becoming bad tempered with age - epitomised by the archetypal grumpy old man Victor Meldrew in One Foot in the Grave.

Both men and women are happiest during middle age but women become more cantankerous the older they get.

Exactly the same number of men and women - 21 per cent - said they felt happiest with their life as a young adult.

A total of 36 per cent of men and 35 per cent of women said they were most content during middle age.

But surprisingly, 30 per cent of men said they were the happiest when they passed 65 - compared to just 26 per cent of women.

The results also found that life does indeed begin at 40, with 64 per cent saying their happiest times have been from middle age onwards.

The survey, commissioned by British manufacturer Stannah, questioned 1,000 men and women over the age of 65 about the happiest times of their lives.

Just four per cent of men and women said the happiest time of their life was when they were a child and another four per cent said that time was still to come.

An overwhelming 77 per cent of people quizzed said they think older people can either make a valuable contribution to society or do more if given the chance.

The research also shows 66 per cent of pensioners think society values elderly people less than they did when they were young, while 60 per cent feel their needs are not understood by the Government.

Patrick Stannah, joint managing director of Stannah Lift Services, said: 'The results of this research bring out some entertaining comparisons.

'But on a more serious level they confirm that for most people life really does begin during middle age.

'Whilst at times society may seem to value youth over experience, these results indicate that when it comes to happiness, Britain’s middle aged and over 65s are far more satisfied with life.

'Despite this, it is unnerving to see that Britain’s 10 million over 65s still feel undervalued by society and misunderstood by government.

'As we celebrate UK Older People’s Day we must consider how we can all work together to engage Britain’s over 65s, who are extremely keen to continue contributing positively to society.'
