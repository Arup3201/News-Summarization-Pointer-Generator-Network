A hard-hitting experiment has revealed how strangers react differently when seeing domestic abuse depending on the gender of the aggressor.

A video filmed with hidden cameras at a London park shows a male actor attacking his ‘girlfriend’ in front of onlookers who immediately rush to help, with one shouting: ‘Oi mate, what's wrong with you?’

The man is told ‘someone will call the police if you carry on doing that to someone’, before a passer-by says to the woman: ‘You don't have to put up with that honey, he's not worth it’.

Assault: A video filmed with hidden cameras at a London park shows a man attacking his 'girlfriend'

Aid: Onlookers who immediately rush to help, with one shouting: 'Oi mate, what's wrong with you?'

Reaction: The man is told 'someone will call the police if you carry on doing that to someone', before a passer-by says to the woman: 'You don't have to put up with that honey, he's not worth it'

The experiment is then conducted with the same actors - but this time, the woman is the aggressor, attacking him and saying: ‘Don't try to walk away - listen to me when I'm talking to you.’

However, instead of reacting with shock, nobody watching even attempts to help the man. They actually seem rather entertained by the incident, stopping to stare and laughing about it.

The videos were filmed with three hidden cameras on May 16 for the ManKind Initiative, a charity based in Taunton, Somerset, which aims to provide support for male victims of domestic abuse.

The clip was made just days after multi-millionaire rap mogul Jay Z was punched and kicked by his wife Beyoncé’s sister Solange Knowles during a violent confrontation in a lift in New York.

Different scenario: Instead of reacting with shock, nobody watching even attempts to help the man

Funny? Onlookers actually seem rather entertained by the incident, stopping to stare and laughing about it

In footage captured on CCTV, Solange lashed out on several occasions with her arms and legs and at one point appeared to kick her brother-in-law. Beyoncé looked on during the assault.

The ManKind Initiative runs a national violence helpline for men, and released the video as part of its #ViolenceIsViolence campaign on Twitter.

The charity claims 38 per cent of domestic abuse victims are male. About 7.1 per cent of women and 4.4 per cent of men were estimated to have experienced domestic abuse in the last year.

It said statistics have also revealed that more married men and cohabitating men suffered from partner abuse in 2012/13 than married women and cohabitating women.
