It is the dream of any sci-fi fans and this video shows the hoverbike finally taking off - thanks to a kickstarter campaign and a forward-thinking inventor.

The futuristic mode of transport is set to go on sale in Britain soon and this video shows how we could soon all be zipping through the skies.

But unfortunately, it's not full-size yet. This hoverbike is only built to a third of the size needed and is actually controlled used a remote.

Chris Malloy, the inventor behind the unique design is hoping that he can sell the small prototypes as drones in a bid to fund his dream of creating a version for people to fly.

But first he will need to secure an aviation certificate for a manned model.

Mr Malloy explained: 'This
 drone was originally built as a proof of concept for our latest 
full-sized Hoverbike prototype,' said Chris Malloy, the drone's 
inventor.

'After
 testing the 1/3rd Hoverbike, we realised that it had lots of features 
that made it a fantastic drone, not only this - selling this scale 
Hoverbike to the public would allow us to raise funds to continue the 
development of the manned version.

'The
 objective of this campaign is to kick-start sales of our beautiful 
1/3rd scale Hoverbike drone and accessories via your pledges, and to 
help create a long term income stream that we can use to continue 
development of the manned Hoverbike.'

The drone can reach speeds of up to 45 miles per hour, but the full-size model is still under construction.

Mr Malloy, of Malloy Aeronautics,
 explained: 'When I first got my helicopter licence I realised the 
helicopter as a design needs a lot of improvements to be made.'

Wanting
 to increase reliability and safety, he added: 'Where we strip away 
complexity and increase safety, that's where the hoverbike comes from.'

The full sized design uses a motorcycle engine and controls.

However, the smaller version uses electric motors, and can be controlled using a standard RC helicopter controller.

On its Kickstarter page, the company explains: 'We combined the simplicity of a motorbike and the freedom of a helicopter to create the world’s first flying motorcycle.

'When compared with a helicopter, the Hoverbike is cheaper, more rugged and easier to use - and represents a whole new way to fly.  The Hoverbike flies like a quadcopter, and can be flown unmanned or manned, while being a safe - low level aerial workhorse with low on-going maintenance.

'We are in the final construction stages of the latest manned prototype of Hoverbike, and in a few months we will start flight testing.The firm says its full sized version could be used to commute on.

The futuristic prototype has the potential to travel up to 92 miles or for about 45 minutes on one tank of fuel and is expected to come with a hefty price tag of more than £45,000.
