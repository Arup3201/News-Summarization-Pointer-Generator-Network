Men spend an average of £129-an-hour during their main Christmas shop - but get it all done in under three hours, a new poll has revealed.

According to a survey, men admitted they do the majority of their Christmas shopping over the course of one day 

A poll of 3,000 people released today by multi-media retailer QVC found that 23 per cent of men manage to do the bulk of their Christmas shopping in an hour or less - with three per cent completing the task in under ten minutes.

Only four per cent said they never bought any Christmas presents.

By comparison, only 12 per cent of women said they could do their Christmas shopping in an hour or less, with 35 per cent saying they could do their shopping in between one and three hours.

None said they could do their shopping in less than 10 minutes and 30 per cent said their Christmas shopping took between three and five hours.

A total of 18 per cent said they took between five and 12 hours to do their main Christmas shop and two per cent of all the women polled said their longest main Christmas shopping trip lasted 12 hours.

Three per cent of women said they never bought Christmas gifts.

That means a total of 63 per cent of men claimed to get the bulk of their Christmas shopping done in just under three hours, spending an average of £366 on all Christmas gifts - paying out £129-an-hour.

Research by QVC found
