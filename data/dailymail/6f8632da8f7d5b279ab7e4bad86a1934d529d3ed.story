It's a gut-busting 8,000-calorie breakfast, featuring 59 items of food... and is so large that diners who want to eat it must first sign a waiver before starting.

Made with six each of bacon rashers, sausages, eggs, black puddings and hash browns, the monstrous meal also comes with  two three-egg omelettes and four portions each of fried potatoes and fried mushrooms. 

It also has four onion rings, four slices of toast, two portions of stewed tomatoes, two portions baked beans, two slices fried bead and half a grilled tomato.

The breakfast includes six sausages and six rashers of bacon, four slices of toast and half a grilled tomato

The Monster Mega Breakfast is served at the Corner Cafe in Portishead, Somerset, and challengers are given an hour to down the £15 meal.

They have a choice of either a pint of milkshake or a can of energy drink to wash down their meal. 

But the mammoth  meal is so large that nobody has yet managed to complete it. 

Since the breakfast was launched last week, five people have attempted the meal and failed to finish it.  

Contestants are given an hour to attempt the challenge, signing a waiver before starting. Rules include no sharing, must be 18 or over and you must stop if you are sick.

Swaps are allowed but only certain items may be exchanged.

Each item's calories had to be worked out individually before they were all added together

Those who complete the meal will be added to the 'champions' wall with a photo and receive a free breakfast voucher, mini trophy and keyring.

The breakfast is cooked normally, with sunflower oil used for frying, and each item's calories had to be worked out individually before they were all added together. 

Manager Lucy Butler said: 'The idea came about from watching Man V Food. Me and my sister thought we had to do it.

'If we we were to do it, we thought, why not try to make it the biggest in Britain?

'We don't make any money off of it. It's just a bit of fun. We are quite a happy cafe and it just came about as fun - nothing else.'

Whipping up the fast food: The meal is cooked with sunflower oil and takes ten minutes to make

The Corner Cafe in Portishead, near Bristol, Somerset unveiled their Man v Food challenge last week 

Despite the huge array of products in the feast, the cafe can whip up a Monster Mega Breakfast in just ten minutes.

One member of staff takes on the eggs, omelettes, beans, toast and tomatoes while a chef will fry up the rest. 

'It takes about 10 minutes to make - for us, that is a long time,' Ms Butler continued. 

'We are a fast food place really, but when one of these orders comes in, the kitchen becomes manic.

'It's quite cramped in the kitchen. We do it so quickly because it would be harder if the person challenging had  to eat it cold.

'As a cafe, we also don't want to serve it cold.'
