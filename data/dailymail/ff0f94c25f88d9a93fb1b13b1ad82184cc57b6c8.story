Germany has rejected Greece's demands for £120billion in reparations for Second World War damages – adding there is ‘zero’ chance they will pay.

New Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, in his first major speech to parliament, yesterday said his country had a 'moral obligation' to claim repayment for a forced wartime loan and other reparations.

Tsipras's anti-austerity Syriza party claims Germany owes it around 162billion euros ($183 billion) -- or around half the country's public debt, which stands at over 315billion euros.

The issue risks aggravating already strained ties between Athens and Berlin, as Tsipras bids to reverse austerity measures imposed by its international creditors.

Greece had 'a moral obligation to our people, to history, to all European peoples who fought and gave their blood against Nazism,' Tsipras said to parliament.

'Our historical obligation is to claim the occupation loan and reparations'.

But Germany's economy minister rejected the call today, insisting the matter was concluded with a signed treaty 25 years ago.

Sigmar Gabriel, who is also Germany's vice-chancellor, said today: 'The likelihood is zero.'

Speaking at a gathering of his Social Democrats in Brandenburg state near Berlin, he added a line had been drawn under 'all these issues' in legal terms, 'at the latest' when the two former Germanys signed a treaty with the Allies in 1990 - which is considered the formal end of World War II.

'There's no sense continuing down this road,' he added.

During the war, the Nazis occupied Greece for four years and forced the Greek central bank to give the Third Reich a loan that financially ruined the country.

Figures from some sources in Athens put the amount still owed by Germany at around 162billion euros ($183 billion) - more than half the level of debt that Greece is currently struggling with.

The demand for compensation was revived by a previous Greek government in 2013 but not pursued.

The two countries share a complex history that has complicated the debt debate.

Greece was occupied by German troops in World War Two, an issue that has resurfaced since it has been forced to endure tough reforms in return for a financial bailout partly funded by euro zone partners.

Many Greeks have blamed euro zone heavyweight Germany for the austerity, leading to the revival of a dormant claim against Berlin for billions of euros of war reparations.

As part of a wider appeal to Europe for solidarity, Greece's new finance minister has suggested a parallel between his country and the rise of Nazism in a bankrupt Germany in the 1930s, referring to Greece's far-right Golden Dawn party.

Gabriel referred to the "Treaty on the Final Settlement with respect to Germany", also known as the "Two plus Four Treaty" signed in September 1990, by the former West and East Germanys and the four World War Two allies just before German reunification.

Under its terms, the four powers renounced all rights they formerly held in Germany. 

For Berlin, the document, also approved by Greece among other states, effectively drew a line under possible future claims for war reparations.

Germany thus denies owing anything more to Greece after the 115million deutsche marks it paid in 1960, one of 12 war compensation deals it signed with Western nations.

But Athens has said it always considered that money as only an initial payment, with the rest of its claims to be discussed after German reunification, which eventually came in 1990.

A finance ministry spokeswoman told reporters today that there was nothing new to add from the German side on the issue.

At the outbreak of the war, Greek Prime Minister Ioannis Metaxas tried to maintain neutrality, but Greece was increasingly subject to pressure from Italy.

Greece entered the Second World War on October 28, 1940 after Italian dictator Benito Mussolini invaded in a bid to emulate Hitler's conquests.

The conflict, known as the Greco-Italian war lasted until April 1941. Italian forces invaded the country after  Metaxas rejected Italy's demand to occupy Greek territory.

As the Italian invasion stalled, Nazi Germany intervened and launched a dual invasion of Greece and Yugoslavia on April 6, 1941.

By the end of April, Axis forces had officially occupied Athens, signalling the end of resistance from Greece. 

King George II and his government-in-exile fled to the Middle East a recall of food supplies caused in a terrible famine during the winter of 1941/19442, in which as many as 100,000 people died.

In 1943, almost the entire Jewish population of Greece was deported to German death camps.

Some 60,000 Greek Jews — more than three-quarters of the nation’s Jewish population — were rounded up and sent to their deaths in the gas chambers of Auschwitz and Treblinka. 

As was the case in European nations invaded by the Germans, the cost of the occupation was paid by the occupied country.  

Hitler’s troops helped themselves to everything, stealing goods and food to such a degree that hundreds of thousands of Greeks were left destitute and starving - and at least 300,000 Greeks died. 

Greece's economy was plundered through forced exports. This led in devastating inflation and a radically lower standard of living for Greeks. 

Then the Third Reich forced the Greek National Bank to lend Hitler's Germany 476million reichsmarks interest-free, bleeding the country dry. 

On March 14, 1942, a team of German and Italian lawyers, in the absence of any Greeks, signed an agreement obliging the Bank of Greece to provide Germany with the ‘war loan’.

After Germany's defeat, the Allied powers organized the Paris Conference on Reparations in the autumn of 1945 where Greece laid claim to $10 billion.
