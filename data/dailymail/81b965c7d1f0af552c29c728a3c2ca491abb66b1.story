Americans will soon be able to have their lunch-time sandwich with a side of coffee-flavored chips., but unfortunately there won't be any added caffeine buzz.

Cappuccino will be just one of four new flavors entering stores later this month a part of Lay's annual 'Do Us a Flavor' contest, which gives people a chance to invent a new potato chip that is sold nationally and win $1million. The other flavors in this year's competition include Cheddar Bacon Mac & Cheese, Mango Salsa and Wasabi Ginger. 

While the Cappuccino chips will taste like espresso, Frito Lay says there isn't any actual coffee or caffeine in the snack food. 

Sweet and savory: Cappucino and Cheddar Bacon Mac & Cheese are two of the new flavors set to hit stores later this month in Lay's annual 'Do Us a Flavor' contest

The four flavors will be hitting stores in late July and people can then vote for their favorite flavor online through October 18.

The promotional stunt is intended to boost customer engagement online and send fans to stores in search of the flavors.

But it also reflects how Frito-Lay is trying to keep up with changing tastes, with its ever-evolving lineup of potato chips now including several Hispanic flavors. Later this month, it also plans to roll out Lay's Stax chips in a Korean barbecue flavor and Lay's Stax in Thai Sweet Chili flavor.

What will be your favorite? People will have until October 18 to vote for their favorite flavor online. Last year, Cheesy Garlic Bread beat out Sriracha and Chicken & Waffles

That would make them the first Asian 
flavors of Lay's chips sold nationally in the U.S., not counting the 
flavors it has introduced as part of the 'Do Us a Flavor' contest. Last 
year, Cheesy Garlic Bread beat out Chicken & Waffles and Sriracha, a
 sauce commonly used in Thai cuisine.

'I can't imagine us 10 years ago doing a wasabi ginger flavor,' said Ram Krishnan, Frito-Lay's senior vice president of brand marketing.

Despite the growing popularity of ethnic flavors, the top four Lay's flavors remain the same: Original, Barbecue, Cheddar & Sour Cream and Sour Cream & Onion.
