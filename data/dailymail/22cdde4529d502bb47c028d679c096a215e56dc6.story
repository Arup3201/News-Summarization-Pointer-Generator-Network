Laying the ground for a return to management, Derek Adams is keen to debunk some popular misconceptions.

The first is that he could start a fight in an empty room. The second that he and his father George are bound together by an umbilical cord.

In seven years at Ross County — with a brief spell at Hibernian thrown in — Adams punched above his weight. Sometimes literally.

Laying the ground for a return to management, Derek Adams is keen to debunk some misconceptions

His departure, a mere four games into the season, owed more to a fraught relationship with chairman Roy MacGregor than any concerns over his managerial ability. There were other minor spats as well; with Danny Lennon, Allan Johnston and Jamie Hamill. And, of course, with Terry Butcher. Especially Terry Butcher.

Sipping cappuccino in a coffee shop in Glasgow’s Merchant City, Adams chuckles over the memories of a very contrived Highland rivalry.

‘I miss being on the touchline,’ he admits. ‘I miss the pressure of going into a game.

‘Even the confrontations. I quite enjoyed that aspect of it all.

‘Big Terry and I were arch rivals at County and Inverness, but the truth is that we actually got on very well.

‘We fought our corner for our football clubs, sure. But it gave everybody a wee bit of interest in the Highlands. It gave it all a wee bit of razzmatazz and edge.

‘We had a go at each other in derby games. But look at the crowds since we left those clubs. They have dwindled. We made that game an occasion.’

There was an infamous stand-off in March 2013. A goalless draw was enlivened by a touchline confrontation which, played out in Glasgow, would have finished in a Scottish government summit. Even now, images on You Tube suggest the pair could hardly stand each other.

‘That’s how we tried to portray it,’ chuckles Adams. ‘It was good for business.

‘We stoked up an atmosphere, a bit of aggro.

‘People thought we didn’t like each other. That we didn’t like each other’s clubs. That it could all go off at any time. And because of that people came through the gates.’

If it was an act it was convincing. An Oscar challenger to Charles Green for best performance in a Scottish drama.

‘Oh, we were good,’ grins Adams. ‘But go back to what (renowned sports impresario) Barry Hearn said a few weeks ago about Scottish football.

‘There is not enough showmanship. Not enough razzmatazz or whatever you want to call it. We have to sell the game and Terry and I did that.

‘What’s the point of a club in the highlands having a dull manager?

‘There are plenty of them in football. People who only have someone else’s opinions.

‘I tried to be different. I had an opinion and I gave it. I thought to myself: “Not everyone is going to like this”.

‘I knew other clubs wouldn’t especially like what I was saying about them.

‘This wee upstart from Ross County thinks because he beat Celtic and Aberdeen and Dundee United he can say what he likes? They thought we should know our place. But Terry and I never accepted that.

‘The reality is that I spoke to Terry just a couple of weeks ago. Terry has even helped me with some bits of my CV, for goodness sake.’

Even so, reputations linger. Chairmen speak.

Opposition supporters, too, have formed a view of Adams as a nippy sweetie quite at odds with the intelligent, thoughtful man behind the panto persona.

‘I’m probably a lot different on the pitch from how I am off it,’ he ponders. ‘When it comes to Saturday afternoon that’s when it all comes.

‘But you can say a lot of successful managers are a bit hot to handle.’

Famously, Adams refuses to swear or drink. In the civilised world this is normal behaviour. In Scottish football it confuses people.

‘I have always been that way,’ he says. ‘I can shout and bawl with the best of people, but I just don’t feel I need to swear.

‘I never drank — it’s the way I am. It’s just me as a person.

‘I don’t feel the need to apologise for it. People probably think if you don’t swear and drink you’re a bit different here. But I do make up for it in terms of anger, I suppose.’

There was anger over the way his departure from Ross County happened. It was barely the end of September when, following months of tension over the direction the club was taking, Adams was fired. Uniquely, the news came in a phonecall from his own father George, the director of football.

‘The chairman never actually spoke to me personally. He never phoned me,’ says Derek.

‘I had to phone him to hear I had been sacked. For the service I had given the club over seven years I felt I deserved better than that.

‘My dad phoned me to say: “Listen, I’ve had a meeting with the chairman. We’re sacked and you have to phone him”.’

‘I phoned him and he said: “You’ll have heard the news”. We had a two-minute conversation and that was it.’

Managers are sacked from football clubs every day. Few hear the news from their own dad.

At County, Derek and George worked closely together. Yet after five months out of work the younger Adams dismisses the notion that they come as a package. That any club hiring Derek gets George as well.

‘There’s no doubt that in Scottish football that’s what many people think,’ he concedes.

‘That’s simply not the case and never will be.

‘Dad accepts that. He knows that.

‘We did a fantastic job at Ross County but we have to move on. He will take his path and I will take mine.

‘Listen, I was always my own man. I picked the team, I decided which players came in.

‘I never used to tell my dad the team because it was none of his business.

Adams revealed that Real Sociedad David Moyes gave him advice on how to deal with being out of a job

‘Working with your father is good and bad. It could be very intense at times.

‘We had spells where we had fall-outs on a weekly basis.

‘The second time round at Ross County there were no more than a handful.

‘When your father is the director of football you speak to him in a way you might not speak to someone else.

‘There were things I wouldn’t share with him in a football sense simply because I wanted to try them my own way. Now I am ready to do that on a more permanent basis.’

Based on his record at County — he took an unfashionable club from the Scottish highlands into the top six of the Premiership and to a Scottish Cup final — Adams should be fending off suitors.

Yet, since ruling himself out of the running for Motherwell, the phone has hardly rung off the hook. St Mirren or Rangers could do worse but, so far, have yet to make a call. Others in the game have been more communicative.

‘I went to Spain last week and took in the Malaga against Villareal game,’ he adds. ‘I then went up to Granada to take in their game with Real Sociedad and Davie Moyes very kindly agreed to meet me after the game for half an hour.

‘I went down to the changing room and spoke to him, to get a wee bit of advice and his take on how you deal with being out of the game.

Adams managed Ross County for six years over two different spells, first 2007-10, then 2011-14

‘For him to take the time to speak and understand where I am and try to help was hugely appreciated. He had all that success at Everton and was really badly treated at Man United and didn’t get the time to move on.

‘He said to me: “Get around clubs, speak to people, watch teams training and their methods”.’

‘So after that I went down to Marbella and I watched Dynamo Kiev, Mainz and Freiburg training. Basle were there as well.

‘By coincidence so was Archie Knox. He was staying in my hotel having lunch with friends when I walked in.

‘He said to me: “Any chance of me coming along to training with you?”. I was glad of the company and ended up taking him to training sessions and games.

‘I picked his brain as well. How can you not? It’s great to learn from the older generation and taking advice from people who have been there.’

He plays some golf and has dabbled in the media. But, at 39, Adams knows he can’t pick or choose his next gig. He doesn’t have the luxury.

‘If you have the hunger and desire — and I do — you hope people will recognise that. I’ve had plenty of leisure time. It’s time to get back to work.’
