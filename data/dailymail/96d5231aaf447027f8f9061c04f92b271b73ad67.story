This is the heartwarming moment a three-year-old girl with a rare brain condition realises she is about to meet Peppa Pig.

Sophie Ryback, who has polymicrogyria affecting the right side of her brain, came face to face with the pre-school children’s cartoon character at Paultons Park in the New Forest, Hampshire.

Her parents Michelle and Michael decided to film their daughter's reaction as she arrived at the theme park, before uploading their video to Facebook, where it has been liked by more than 6,000 people on the Peppa Pig World page.

Beaming: Sophie, who has the rare brain condition polymicrogyria, bursts into a wide smile, before pointing and dashing to meet the famous cartoon character

In the clip Sophie can be seen bursting into a huge smile as she spots Peppa, before dashing to meet the character.

'The only reason we filmed her reaction 
was because my friend who looked after our dog wanted to see - we never 
expected this reaction,' said nursery nurse Mrs Ryback, 32, from Sittingbourne, Kent.

'It’s really touching that it’s been 
shared so many times, I feel very overwhelmed. The Peppa Pig UK Facebook
 site put the video online a few weeks after we went.

'Within minutes I was getting calls and messages telling me how many people had watched it.

Adventure: Sophie and her father grin as they test out one of the park's rides

Condition: Sophie (pictured right at the Evalina Children's Hospital, London) suffers from unilateral polymicrogyria which affects the right side of her brain and causes epilepsy and a reduction in movement

'I’ve had messages from people in Canada, New Zealand and even Saudi Arabia.'

Sophie, her parents and older brother Oliver, six, were treated to the day at Peppa Pig World in April by the charity Polymicrogyria Family Support UK who support 
families of children with the illness.

It is thought that polymicrogyria affects around one in 2,500 babies, although many cases go undiagnosed.

The condition affects people in many different ways and Sophie has unilateral polymicrogyria, meaning it only affects the right side of her brain.

Struggle: Sophie undergoing epilepsy tests at Evelina Children's Hospital. Her seizures often erase the few words she has learnt from her memory - so her parents are not sure if she will ever talk

Diagnosis: Sophie's parents are unsure as to what the future holds for their daughter, pictured as a newborn in hospital

As a result she also has epilepsy, left hemiplegia - which causes the reduction in movement on the left side of her body - and a development delay.

Sophie also has a severe speech delay and the seizures often erase the few words she has learnt from her memory - so her parents are not sure if she will ever talk

'Doctors have told us they don’t know what the future holds for us,' said Mrs Ryback.

'The worst case scenario is that Sophie’s seizures get more severe and uncontrollable.

'She can’t speak and every time she has a seizure she loses everything she has learned. But she keeps defying doctors.

'Every time they say she can’t do something she proves them wrong, that’s why they can’t tell us what will happen in the long term.'

Fear: Sophie's mother says the worst case scenario is that Sophie's seizures become uncontrollable

Siblings: Sophie with her older brother Oliver, six, who also got to enjoy the day out to see Peppa Pig
