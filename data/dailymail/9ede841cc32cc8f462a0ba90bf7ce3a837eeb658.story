Presented by Swarovski - and entitled Matthew Williamson XV - this was never going to be a low-budget indie mumblecore flick.

Instead the short film made by the fashion designer to celebrate his 15 years in the industry is a sparkly, well-polished spectacle featuring a number of famous faces and dance routines orchestrated by the award-winning choreographer Wayne McGregor.

The colourful dreamlike production 
runs to just three minutes but manages to pack in a complex dance 
routine, lots of breathy callings of'Matthew', and a plot involving a sleeping 
teenage Matthew Williamson being called down for school by his mother.

Directed
by Tell No One, the film was shot at the imposing 17th century country 
house, Aynhoe park, in Oxfordshire, and also features eight ballerinas 
from the Royal Ballet, choreographed by Wayne McGregor, founder of the 
Random Dance company.

As
well as the the Matthew Williamson clothes, the film captures a trio of
limited edition Swarovski encrusted designs made especially for the 
film. Each piece is available to purchase from Net-a-Porter.
