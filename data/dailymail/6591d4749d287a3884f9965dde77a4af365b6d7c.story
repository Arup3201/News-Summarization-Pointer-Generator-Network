A mother and his mother have died trying to retrieve a new mobile phone from a toilet septic tank in China.

The man's new wife had dropped her device – worth 2,000 yuan (£190) – in the open-pit toilet, reported Dahe, a website run by the Henan provincial government.

Her husband jumped in to try to find the phone but was overcome by fumes and passed out, it said.

His mother went in to the cesspit to 
try to help her son, but also fainted.

The woman who dropped the phone went in to help her husband and mother-in-law, but she also became ill as well as her father-in-law.

Two neighbours then entered the tank and also became ill.

'In
 five minutes, two lives have gone and my daughter-in-law is 
unconscious, leaving a half-paralysed elderly man and a one-year-old 
grandson,' the husband's distraught uncle said, according to Dahe.

'How are we supposed to go on?'
