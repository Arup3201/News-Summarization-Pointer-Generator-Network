An unemployed English Literature graduate has posted her CV in the back of a black cab in a bid to find work after being turned down for dozens of jobs.

Emma Clifford has been looking for work in publishing and marketing since graduating from Canterbury Christ Church University with a 2:1 in June.

But the 21-year-old has now resorted to taking out an advert in the back of a black cab to grab the attention of prospective employers after being turned down for dozens of jobs.

Seeking employment: Graduate Emma Clifford took out an advert in the back of a black cab in a bid to find work after being turned down for dozens of jobs

She said: 'I've got to admit it is a bit disheartening to work really hard at university to get a 2:1 and then not be able to get a job at the end of it.

'But given the difficult economic climate I always knew I wouldn't just be able to walk into a job.

'It's been three months now since I graduated and I decided I've got to try and do something different to get myself noticed.

'I was thinking of inventive ways I could advertise myself and suddenly thought that having an advert in a black cab could really grab someone's attention.

'A lot of people travel in a London taxi every day, so I thought there's a real chance the advert would catch someone's eye - hopefully a potential employer.

'I've got a friend who drives a black cab in central London and he said he'd love to try and help me, so fortunately I didn't even pay for the ad.'

The latest figures, released last month,
revealed youth unemployment had fallen by 20,000 on last year, to 
959,000, giving a jobless rate for 16 to 24-year-olds of 20.9 per cent.

Miss Clifford, who lives in Bexleyheath, Kent, with her family, works every Sunday as a catering assistant at John Lewis in Bluewater shopping centre - but is desperate to find full-time work.

She said: 'I've been applying the traditional ways by going on websites and filling in application forms and sending off dozens of covering letters with CVs.

'But I'm yet to get a single interview. All I've had is emails back saying: "Thank you for applying, but we've been inundated with applications".

'I've managed to get myself some work experience in publishing, which is great because I'm prepared to do anything to improve myself and make myself more employable.

'But I really need to be earning a salary. My ideal job would be as a publishing or marketing assistant. It's something I'm really passionate about.

'I'm just hoping my persistence will pay off in the end.'
