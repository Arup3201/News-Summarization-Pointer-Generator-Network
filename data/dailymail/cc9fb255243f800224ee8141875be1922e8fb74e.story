Found: A sketch shows Fannie Millier, one of the abducted Amish girls who were returned to their parents Thursday. The Amish forbid photos

Two Amish girls who sparked a massive search after being kidnapped from their family's roadside produce stand in northern New York last night have been found unharmed.

Six-year-old Delila Miller and 12-year-old Fannie Miller were bundled into a white car as they went to help a customer in Oswegatchie around 7.20pm Wednesday, according to reports.

About 24 hours later, the children were reunited with their parents, according to a law enforcement source. 

St. Lawrence County District Attorney Mary Raintold said the sisters 'seem to be healthy,' but were 'cold and wet.'

7News reported that the children were snatched by two men who took them to a house near Richville and left them there, ordering them not to go anywhere.

But Fannie and Delila ran away and sought help.

The two girls came by the house of Jeff Stinson, who recognized Fannie and Delila as the kidnapped children and took them to their parents. 

Earlier today, the St. Lawrence County Sheriff's Office released a drawing of what Fannie looks like. Members of the Amish community do not allow photos of themselves, which they see as an act of pride and a violation of their religious beliefs.

Kevin Wells has said his office had received 'numerous leads' and that state troopers, forest rangers and U.S. Border Patrol agents were part of the search. Dive teams have also been called in to scour the nearby Oswegatchie River.

The girls had been milking in their 
family's barn on Wednesday evening when they headed to the road because 
they believed a customer was at the vegetable stand, WWNY reported last night.

Search: Officials search a field after the girls vanished; a witness said he saw a white car near their stand

An Amish witness who was passing told authorities that he saw a man put something in the back of his white four-door sedan and, when he drove off, the little girls were gone.

Authorities had placed a protective covering on tire tracks on the road and were going through the register of sex offenders in the area.

Authorities say both girls were wearing dark
 blue dresses with blue aprons and black bonnets in line with Amish 
custom - but warned that their abductor might have changed their 
clothes.

Delila Miller has brown hair, brown 
eyes, weighs about 50 pounds and is roughly four feet tall. She has a 
round scar on her forehead and is missing front teeth.

Fannie Miller also has brown hair and brown eyes and is five feet tall and about 90 pounds. She is crosseyed.

Both of the girls have heavy accents and speak in the Pennsylvania Dutch dialect, but the 12-year-old, Fannie, speaks English, SYR reported.

Oswegatchie is on the Canadian border 150 miles northwest of Albany.
