Rodley bought his manorial title at auction in 1986

A self-styled peer dubbed the 'Lord of Fraud' who once planned the world's biggest bank raid has been ordered to pay back £1.2m to the victims of his investment scam or face even longer in prison.

'Lord' Hugh Rodley, 67, was jailed for seven years in 2012 for fleecing up to 600 pensioners out of £6million with the promise of 'rich rewards' in return for them investing their life savings.

The fraudster, who used his ill gotten gains to splash out on a chauffeur driven Rolls Royce and a £2million mansion in Gloucestershire, has now been ordered to repay £1.2million to his victims. 

If he fails to repay the money in six months he must serve another seven years in prison.

Andy Archibald, Deputy Director of the NCA's National Cyber Crime Unit, said: 'Rodley's criminality funded a lavish lifestyle, but our investigations do not end when a criminal is put in jail.

'Money is at the heart of all organised crime and is the motivation for most criminals, so we are determined to take their profits off them.

'The clock is ticking for Rodley to hand over the money he made from this enterprise.

Rodley, along with several accomplices, targeted the elderly and sold them worthless shares in a boiler room scam. 

The gang had drawn up a 'sucker list' of targets, detailing people who had already invested in some shares. 

They then used high pressure sales techniques to trick these people into handing over money to invest in firms they claimed would be floated on the stock market. They claimed these firms handled 'exotic' and 'fail-safe' projects such as land development in Europe and Asia. 

However none of the firms were ever floated and the investors lost thousands to the fraudsters.  

One 87-year-old man lost more than £800,000.

Rodley, along with accomplices Julian Silver, 45, Adam Corbett, 34, and Sonny Willis, 31, were found guilty of running the scam between 2004 and 2007 after a trial at Southwark Crown Court in 2012.

Simon Farrell, prosecuting, said the four men had been involved in the 'dishonest extraction of several million pounds' from investors.

Victims were told they would quickly make 'handsome profits' when the companies were floated on the Alternative Investment Market.

'This type of trick involving the dishonest selling of worthless shares is colloquially known as a boiler room fraud,' said Mr Farrell.

'The term is used to describe high pressure sales techniques often targeting elderly and vulnerable victims.

'A large number of victims in this case were subjected to high pressure sells and repeated calls until they agreed to invest.

'One 87-year-old gentleman unfortunately parted with £828,000 investing in most of the companies.

'Many of the elderly victims are not fools by any stretch of the imagination; they are all successful, responsible individuals who eventually gave in to sales patter.

'Those who agreed to invest were almost always sent a contract setting out the amount of shares they agreed to, the price per share and a letter providing details of how their share made payment.'

Mr Farrell said none of the victims received any return on their investment as most of the companies appeared to do little or no trading at all.

At the heart of the scam was a 'floor book' - a list of more than 1,000 investors, of whom 600 handed over cash to the fraudsters.

The document was seized after being discovered on Rodley's computer when his Tewkesbury property was searched following his arrest.

Mr Farrell added: 'The floor book records around £6million worth of investment and marks as received a figure in the region of £3million.

'But what the bank accounts show is what was actually received that can in fact be traced back to the floor book - around £2.7million.

'The defendants used so-called sucker lists, detailing people with small shareholdings, and started phoning people up offering shares in exotic land development buildings in Europe and Asia and water desalination projects.'

The group defrauded their victims through companies including World Aqua Tech PLC, ART IT PLC, Mediatel PLC, BMHC PLC, European Land Development Agency PLC, and Eurowaste Recycling PLC, between January 1, 2005 and June 30, 2007.

Mr Farrell said the invested money passed through the bank accounts either of the fraudsters, or accounts controlled by them. 

Phillip Dennett, 44, was cleared of involvement in the fraud but found guilty of laundering the proceeds along with the others.

Rodley, a father of three, was born Brian McGough in Ireland in 1947 and bought his manorial title at auction in 1986. 

During his trial he claimed he was not part of any plot to con investors and told jurors he did not act dishonestly.

In 2010 Rodley was jailed for eight years for an extraordinary plot to steal £229m from a Japanese bank in one of the biggest ever cyber crimes of its kind.

The plan to plunder Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation in 2004, failed at the last minute after the bungling computer boffins inputted the wrong codes.

Rodley was jailed for eight years for his part in the plot to steal £229 from a Japanese bank, which would have been the biggest cyber crime in history

During his trial he was accused of trying to pass off fake cheques worth £45,120 and £35,399 and trying to defraud his co-conspirator David Nash by using his identity to spend £27,000 on credit cards

The plot unravelled when two expert hackers made a mistake as they tried to transfer money from the bank to 10 accounts in other countries. 

This failed and they returned the next day to attempt more transfers but these also failed because they had made an error in filling in the wire transfer information boxes. 

Eventually a complex paper trail of accounts they were supposed to transfer to led to Rodley, Nash, Bernard Davies and Inger Britt Marie Malmros - a Swedish national who was cleared of all charges.

Davies died before the trial.

The men fronted companies used for illegal money laundering. 

Rodley became nervous when he had not heard about the cash and went to Cheltenham to send a fax to a bank in Dubai asking for the money. 

It was not there and Rodley was eventually arrested by detectives. 

The two hackers - Jan Van Osselaer from Belgium and Gilles Poelvoorde from France, admitted a charge of conspiracy to steal. 

Rodley was convicted of conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to transfer criminal property.

The self-styled lord said he believed Willis and Corbett were legitimate businessmen looking to help promote two of his companies, Mediatel and Eurowaste Recycling.

Melonie Moody, from the City of London's Asset Recovery Team, said: 'Our investigation uncovered how Rodley, Willis, Corbett and Silver preyed on ordinary, hard-working people and tricked them into investing their lifesavings in worthless shares.' 

Rodley, of Gloucestershire, was jailed in 2012 for the crime. At the time he was already serving an eight year prison sentence at the time for  plotting to steal £229m from a Japanese bank in one of the biggest ever cyber crimes of its kind.

He must now pay £1,236,736 within six months of face another seven years in prison.

Willis, of  Billericay, Essex, must pay £249,950 within six months or face another two and a half years in jail.

Silver, of  Hinx Hill, Ashford, Kent, must repay £1 as he has no available assets, or face another day in prison.

Corbett, of Camberley, Surrey, must fork out £528.65 or serve an additional two weeks in prison.

They were all convicted of conspiracy to defraud and were alleged to have committed this with Bernard Davies, who died before the trial.
