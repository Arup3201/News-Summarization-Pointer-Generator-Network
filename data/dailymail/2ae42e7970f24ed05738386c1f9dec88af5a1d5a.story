A 60-mile wide 'no drone zone' will be set up around the Super Bowl on Sunday as part of the stringent security operation. 

The Federal Aviation Authority is setting up flight restrictions in several circles around Phoenix, Arizona, for the big game and have threatened to prosecute those who ignore the ban.

It follows a video campaign from the government agency to make sure no drones hover anywhere near the action at the University of Phoenix stadium.

The Department of Homeland Security has also announced it will be scanning social media in a bid to uncover any potential threats which may arise.

'No drone zone':  The Federal Aviation Authority is believed to be setting up flight restrictions in several circles in Phoenix, Arizona, for the big game on Sunday. It includes a strict ban on unmanned aircraft 

Within 10 miles of the stadium no aircraft - including media banners and blimps - will be allowed. 

According to the FAA a second outer ring will encompass the airspace between 10 and 30 miles from the stadium. 

General aviation aircraft will be able to operate there provided they have filed flight plans, are using transponders that broadcast specific information about their aircraft.

No unmanned aircraft will be allowed in either ring, but Gizmodo reports that any spotted within a 60 mile radius could be in violation. 

Pilots have also been warned 'deadly force' could be used against them if they pose and imminent security threat. 

The FAA expects an additional 1,200 to 1,400 general aviation flights into the Phoenix area for Super Bowl XLIX, and has been planning for the event for more than a year. 

According to Nextgov Homeland Security will be using social-media tracking technology to filter bogus and real threats made online.

It comes after a number of flights were grounded this week because of messages  

Message: The government agency launched a video campaign  to make sure no drones hover anywhere near the action during game time

U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson met top local law enforcement officials in Phoenix on Wednesday and will visit the University of Phoenix stadium in nearby Glendale, where the Seattle Seahawks will play the New England Patriots for the National Football League championship.

Ticket-holders are being told to get there early for a rigorous security screening procedure that will involve metal detectors and a pat-down search.

Deadly shootings in Paris and the recent arrest of suspects in Belgium, Greece and Germany have heightened fears of more attacks around the world, and social media accounts linked to Middle East militant groups have carried a number of threats to attack high-profile U.S. events. 

Federal security officials have said U.S. agencies are unaware of any specific or credible terrorist threat against the Super Bowl. Johnson echoed that on Wednesday.

At a news conference, NFL Chief Security Officer Jeffrey Miller said: 'Most items cannot be carried into the stadium.'

Only clear plastic, vinyl or PVC bags measuring 12 inches by 6 inches by 12 inches, or 1-gallon freezer bags, will be permitted, as well as small clutch bags 'approximately the size of a hand,' he said.

Coolers, backpacks, computer and camera bags, and all other kinds of luggage are prohibited, as are bottles and beverages including alcohol, camcorders, food, fireworks, Frisbees and umbrellas, according to an NFL list.

Exceptions will made for medically necessary items, after an inspection at a specially designated stadium gate.

'While the level of security is high, there should only be a moderate inconvenience for our fans: a very small price to pay,' Miller said.

Debora Black, chief of the Glendale Police Department, said that while most people viewed the Super Bowl as an exciting finale to the football season, others saw the event as a target.

'We are confident that we are prepared to identify and protect against any threat,' Black said. 'While the world is focused on the (Phoenix-area) Valley for this week, we have been focused on this week for over a year.'

Super Bowl security officials acknowledge the NFL championship game represents a high profile target on a world stage but are unaware of any specific credible threats against Sunday's showcase. 

Over 4,000 private security personnel will be deployed and the almost 3,000 member Phoenix police force will be on Super Bowl duty

'There is no specific credible threat,' said Johnson, who has appointed a 'federal coordination team' to work with local, state and federal agencies to ensure safety of fans, players and other workers associated with the Super Bowl. 'I'm confident we will have a safe and secure and successful event.'

Sunday's game has been given a Special Event Assessment Rating (SEAR) 1 rating, the same as in previous years, except for the year after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, when a higher level was declared.

But security will be tight and visible around Super Bowl-related events as well as during the game itself. All fans will pass through metal detectors and pat downs.

Over 4,000 private security personnel will be deployed and the almost 3,000 member Phoenix police force will be on Super Bowl duty.

Nuclear device sniffing teams will be deployed and a network of Bio-Watch detectors will be set up to provide a warning in the event of a biological attack.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said in a press release it had held special cyber-security and anti-sniper training sessions.
