A Gold Coast woman says she was left stressed after her bank balance was mysteriously increased to almost $10 million.

Sue Lamb, 49, from Labrador, was shocked when she used an ATM to withdraw $100 from her ANZ credit account on Saturday and the bank receipt said her available balance was $9,990,420.94.

Ms Lamb said she called ANZ to inform them of the error but claims a customer service agent told her it was her money and there was nothing he could do.

'They've really caused grave stress for my family,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

Sue Lamb, 49, from Labrador had almost $10 million mysteriously deposited into her bank account

'I've seen stories around the world where people get in a lot of trouble for this.'

Ms Lamb said the money had been added to the limit on her credit card – an account she didn't usually use to withdraw cash.

'I never use that credit card to withdraw cash ever,' she said.

'If I had never gotten money out I never would have known.'

Ms Lamb said when she spoke to a customer service agent on Sunday he first insisted the money was hers, and then told her she would have to ring back during business hours on Monday if she had any concerns.

'I said "It's not my money" and he said "But it's a compound of all your company's funds", but I don't have a company, I'm a sole trader,' she said.

'This gentleman didn't seem too concerned, he was more concerned with telling me that they were my funds.

Ms Lamb used a Bank of Queensland ATM to withdraw $100 from her ANZ bank account on Saturday and the bank receipt said her available balance was $9,990,420.94

'I'm just appalled that ANZ bank haven't contacted me, and I'm really concerned that people really need to check the credit limits on their account.'

On Monday morning Ms Lamb still had not heard from the bank, and had checked her account again to find the $10 million was gone and she was listed as being $7500 in debt.

'It's just ridiculous, I mean they've put $10 million credit on my credit card,' she said.

'Now the fact is they've put me in debt $7500. It's someone's debt but it's not mine.

'This happened on Valentine's Day, so the CEO of ANZ must want to marry me.

'After all the stress you caused you need to give me roses, chocolates and a holiday.'

Ms Lamb said she called ANZ to inform them of the error but claims the customer service agent told her it was her money and there was nothing he could do

An ANZ spokeswoman said Ms Lamb had chosen to have an 'unlimited monthly spend cap' on her account.

'The available balance on the BOQ ATM receipt refers to the amount of the monthly spend cap rather than the available credit,' she said.

'We're investigating why the BOQ’s receipt is showing the monthly spend cap rather than the actual balance.

'We would like to apologise to Ms Lamb for any inconvenience and we will be contacting her today.' 

In 2012, a New Zealand petrol station owner was sentenced to four years and seven months in jail after going on the run when a bank error mistakenly transferred $NZ10 million into his account.
