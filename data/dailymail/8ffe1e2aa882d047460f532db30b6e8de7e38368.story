Shopping for clothes used to be so simple. You would stroll into a shop, pick up a few items, try them on in a changing room and then take them to the till if they looked alright on.

Now some chains are doing things a little differently. Abercrombie & Fitch and its offshoot, Hollister, sell their clothes targeted at 14-18 year olds in the dark. Well almost.

The low lighting aims to give the shops a
 casino or VIP club-like feel, bathing their teenage customers in 
luxury. But parents are less impressed, complaining of bumping into 
tables, not being able to see colours or prices and - in at least one 
case - losing a child in the dark.

What do teenagers see in the brand? Abercrombie & Fitch workers - including the topless models who stand by the door - in the poorly-lit flagship store

It is not just the lighting that disappoints. The ear-splittingly loud music helps add to the exclusive atmosphere, and the clothes are even sprayed with an intoxicating scent that lingers long after you have left the store.

And there's also the unusual experience of walking past a couple of models in swimsuits on your way into the shop - whatever the weather.

Teenagers queue up to get their photos taken with the six-packed sales assistants while everyone else cringes. Fortunately, the darkness spares some of everyone's blushes.

Linda Watson, 51, from Sutton Coldfield lost her daughter in the shop.

She said: 'I went to look somewhere else and I just couldn't find her when I turned around because it's so dark. I had to come out and phone her.'

Another mother, Linda Peach, added: 'When we go in I cling to my daughters and say, "don't lose me".'

Welder Nick Bull, 30, from Birmingham, 
said of Hollister in the Bullring shopping centre: 'I can't see the sizes, I can't see 
the prices, I can't see the till - I can't see the point.'

The sales strategy has sparked Facebook groups including 'Turn up the lights and turn down the music Abercrombie!,' and 'Welcome to Hollister, would you like a torch?'

Teenager Lauren Playfoot wrote on one of the group's message boards: 'My mate bought a pink checked top, turns out to be orange.'

George Warrington added: 'The thing is if Hollister can't afford lights, where does the hundred quid I spend every time i go in go?'

A spokesperson for Hollister refused to comment on the issue.  But one worker said: 'It creates an atmosphere that allows you to come in and hang out while finding some cool clothes. 

'It gives a type of casino-feel,where people can get lost in a club-like environment, people relax, and hopefully spend more.' 

It's clearly working: Hollister opened its first British store in 2008. It now has 22 UK outlets, with more to come, much to the delight off its teenage fans

Darkness is part of the brand: Wallis Stewart wrote on Facebook, 'I don't think I'd want them to fix the lights 'cause with different lights it just wouldn't be Hollister!'

Matt Helbig, who worked for the company for three years commented: 'Stores such as Abercrombie & Fitch 
and Hollister, both owned by the Abercrombie & Fitch Company, focus a
 lot on providing a certain atmosphere to the customer.

'By having low 
lights, a signature fragrance spritzed on the clothes, and maybe louder 
music than most stores, A&F sets itself apart from other clothing 
stores.'

Loud music and strong smells just add to that exclusive-feeling experience.

The perfume, in particular reminds customers of the shop long after they have gone elsewhere. The tactic was pushed to new limits in Ginza, Tokyo. When a new Abercrombie & Fitch flagship store opened there, even the streets were sprayed with the scent.

And it all seems to be working. Hollister opened its first British store in 2008. It now has 22 UK outlets, with more to come. There is often a queue outside its stores helping to make the clothes even more desirable.

And darkness has already become part of the brand. As Wallis Stewart comments on Facebook: 'I don't think I'd want them to 
fix the lights 'cause with different lights it just wouldn't be Hollister!
