Cardiff City will return to playing in their traditional blue home kit after club owner Vincent Tan agreed to the move following pressure from fans.

Tan had been at the heart of Cardiff's controversial rebrand from blue to red, with the Malaysian businessman believing the colour would bring good fortune.

But fans voted unanimously on Thursday at a meeting to have the club return to their original colours, and Cardiff will now play in blue when Fulham visit in the Championship on Saturday.

As well as reverting back to blue kits, the club are also planning to redesign the club badge featuring a bluebird as the primary focus.

Tan had told Sky Sports as recently as Christmas Day that 'Cardiff will stay red' and that he would take no notice of protests planned by supporters' groups against the re-branding and the threat of thousands of season tickets not being renewed. 

The club owner controversially changed Cardiff's kit colour to red in 2012, as well as replacing their traditional badge featuring a bluebird to a Welsh Dragon.

Nicknamed the Bluebirds, the club had been playing in blue since it became known as Cardiff City 1908.

The club owner's decision came after he called a meeting at Cardiff City Stadium on Thursday where club officials consulted a cross-section of fans.

Tan was not present at the meeting himself, but Cardiff City manager Russell Slade was, and he was full of praise for the club's fans who attended.

'People were able to say what they thought and they said it an eloquent and intelligent way,' said Slade.

'It was received very well from everyone at the football club and I thought it was a giant step.

'If ever that was a big step that was it and it would be nice if we were in blue on Saturday. This is a fantastic opportunity to build a new platform and put the bricks in place to rebuild and start again.'

Cardiff have slipped to 12th in the Championship after going five games without a win but Slade believes changing the colour and the crest could provide the momentum necessary to make a charge for the play-offs in the second half of the season.

'If you're going to be successful in any business, any football club, you need everyone pulling together as a unit,' Slade said.

'Only that way can you sustain success. You might have a modicum of success in the short term but if you want long-term success you need unity.'

The Christmas and New Year period has given me time to reflect on the events of the last year. Spending time with my family had a profound effect upon me. 

My mother, Madam Low Siew Beng, a devout Buddhist, who attended Cardiff City Football Club to watch them play, spoke to me on the importance of togetherness, unity and happiness. Cardiff City Football Club is important to me and I wish to see it united and happy. 

With the guidance, blessing and influence of my mother, I asked my Chairman, Mehmet Dalman and Chief Executive Officer, Ken Choo for their advice and to consult with a good cross-section of the fan base.This meeting took place last night, when some seventy representatives of our supporters were present.

My thanks and gratitude to those who gave up their evening and time to be there. I am informed that this was a very productive and frank exchange of views, but all with the same objective to strengthen our Club. 

These views were also added to by a large number of emails that were sent to the Club over the last 24 hours from our wider supporter base.

To paraphrase John F. Kennedy, 'Let us never compromise out of fear. But let us never fear to compromise.'

My wish is to unite and make the Club successful and in order to achieve this I fully support the Board’s decision to implement the following changes:

1. Starting from Saturday, 10 January 2015 and until the end of this season, our home kit shall be Blue. Our Away Kit shall be Red. I would like to thank the Football League for their approval to facilitate my request.

2. For the 2015/16 season, Cardiff City’s home kit colour shall be Blue. Our Away Kit colour shall be Red.

3. The Club badge will be redesigned to reflect the dominance of the Bluebird, while celebrating the proud history and heritage of the Club. I also wish to incorporate elements representative of my culture and beliefs, which I hope are respected.

4. As the Chairman has explained, the debt to equity resolution is not straightforward. We will deal with this in due course, with all decisions made in the best interest of the Club.

5. For the 2015/16 Season, Non Price Freeze Season Tickets will be reduced and Price Freeze Season Tickets shall be adjusted accordingly to match these prices.I very much hope these steps will bring unity, success and happiness to our Club.

The challenge ahead for us is enormous and I truly believe we will overcome these obstacles as a united Club. I believe with divine blessings, Cardiff City Football Club will achieve great success.

Warm regards

Vincent Tan Chee Yioun
