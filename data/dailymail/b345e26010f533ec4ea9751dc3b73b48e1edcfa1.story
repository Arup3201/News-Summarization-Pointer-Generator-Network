The number of Americans who believe that JFK’s assassination was the result of a government conspiracy has dropped over the past ten years reveals a new poll.

According to an Associated Press-GfK poll, conducted in April, 59 percent of Americans think multiple people were involved in a conspiracy to kill the president, while 24 percent think Oswald acted alone, and 16 percent are unsure.

While a clear majority still suspect there was a conspiracy behind the tragic death of President John F. Kennedy, the number is down from the 75 percent who felt there was a conspiracy in a 2003 Gallup poll.

As the 50th anniversary of Kennedy's death approaches, the number of Americans who believe Oswald acted alone is at its highest since the period three years after the Nov. 22, 1963, assassination, when 36 percent said one man was responsible.

President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed the Warren Commission on Nov. 29, 1963, to investigate both Kennedy's assassination and the killing of Oswald days later. The commission concluded that Oswald was the lone gunman.

Those who were adults in 1963 were almost as likely as younger Americans to say that Kennedy's killing was a conspiracy involving multiple people - 55 percent, compared to 61 percent.

The poll was conducted April 11-15, 2013 and involved landline and cellphone interviews with 1,004 adults nationwide.

There has been a 16 per cent drop over the past ten years in the number of people who believe in conspiracy theories surrounding JFK's assassination

Five decades after President John F. Kennedy was fatally shot and long after official inquiries ended, thousands of pages of investigative documents remain withheld from public view.

The contents of these files are partially known - and intriguing - and conspiracy buffs are not the only ones seeking to open them for a closer look.

Some serious researchers believe the off-limits files could shed valuable new light on nagging mysteries of the assassination - including what U.S. intelligence agencies knew about accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald before Nov. 22, 1963.

It turns out that several hundred of the still-classified pages concern a deceased CIA agent, George Joannides, whose activities just before the assassination and, fascinatingly, during a government investigation years later, have tantalized researchers for years.

‘This is not about conspiracy, this is about transparency,’ said Jefferson Morley, a former Washington Post reporter and author embroiled in a decade-long lawsuit against the CIA, seeking release of the closed documents. 

‘I think the CIA should obey the law. I don't think most people think that's a crazy idea.’

Morley's effort has been joined by 
others, including G. Robert Blakey, chief counsel for a House 
investigation into the JFK assassination in the 1970s. But so far, the 
Joannides files and thousands more pages primarily from the CIA remain 
off-limits at a National Archives center in College Park, Md.

Others say the continued sealing of 50-year-old documents raises needless questions in the public's mind and encourages conspiracy theories.

‘There is no question that in various ways the CIA obfuscated, but it may be they were covering up operations that were justifiable, benign CIA operations that had absolutely nothing to do with the Kennedy assassination,’ said Anthony Summers, a British author who has written extensively about the JFK case.

‘But after 50 years, there is no reason that I can think of why such operations should still be concealed,’ Summers said.

‘By withholding Joannides material, the agency continues to encourage the public to believe they're covering up something more sinister.’

Conspiracy does however remains the most popular theory with 59 percent

The number of Americans who think Oswald acted alone has also increased as a consequence and is at its highest since 1966
