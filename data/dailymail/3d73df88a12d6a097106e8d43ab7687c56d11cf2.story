'Thought matter had been resolved': Florida State quarterback Jameis Winston is being investigated by police for an alleged sexual assault that was reported by the victim almost a year ago

A Florida State quarterback is being investigated for an alleged sexual assault reported nearly a year ago, it has emerged.

Jameis Winston has been accused of attacking the female victim with 'physical force' at an apartment last December, according to the police report.

The university and Winston's attorney confirmed yesterday that the Tallahassee Police Department is conducting an investigation.

Tallahassee Police Department officials refused to answer any questions.

However, they did release a heavily redacted two-page incident report.

The report does not mention Winston by name, but it says the incident took place between 1.30am and 2am on December 7.

It describes the suspect in the sexual assault case as being between 5ft 9ins and 5ft 11ins.

Winston is listed by Florida State at 6ft 4ins.

Timothy Jansen, a Tallahassee attorney, said Winston hasn't been interviewed by police.

Jansen said that at one point he had believed the matter had been resolved.

'We basically hope it will be resolved quickly and that Winston will be exonerated and he will be able to focus all his attention on academics and football,' Jansen said.

Winston has been spectacular for the 
No 2 Seminoles in his first college season and the redshirt freshman is 
one of the leading contenders for the Heisman Trophy.

He
has passed for 2,661 yards and 26 touchdowns to help Florida State win 
its first nine games and move into position for a spot in the BCS 
national championship game.

The school and coach Jimbo Fisher wouldn't comment because the investigation wasn't closed.

The school also said there was no change in Winston's status for the Seminoles' home game Saturday against Syracuse.
