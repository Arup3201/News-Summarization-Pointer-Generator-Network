Late night trickster Jimmy Kimmel was up to usual shenanigans on Thursday night's show turning his attention this time on a bunch of sucker fashionistas so desperate to appear on trend that they were willing to talk admiringly about labels they couldn’t possibly have heard off – because they simply don’t exist.

New York Fashion Week took place this week at the Lincoln Center near Central Park and Kimmel sent along a young presenter to try and catch out some of the fashion forward attendees.

Like lambs to the slaughter the hipsters spoke admiringly of their love for the work of George Costanza, Richardo Montalban and Joe Isuzu.

It's called fashion look it up! These fashion forward hipsters were interviewed on Kimmel about made-up trends including wearing watermelons as headgear

Surely they weren’t talking about the deeply unfashionable Seinfeld character, the Mexican actor famed for portraying Khan in Star Trek and the fictional spokesman for the Isuzu car and truck brand?

The best of the bunch was the young man wearing everything black and too much foundation who spoke of his admiration for Eddie Munster.

‘Good aesthetic,’ said the goth of the werewolf boy from The Munsters, seemingly oblivious to just how much of a key influence the 60s TV character had been on his current image.

Having humiliated one set of posers, Kimmel’s next trick was to ask his unwitting stooges if they had seen the runway show where model had worn watermelons on their heads.

‘It's called fashion look it up!’ said one super serious fashionista with fierce green hair as he glared at the interviewer for daring question the creative integrity of the designer. 

Another dedicated follower of fashion was asked for their reaction to the models who wore dog poop on their heads as they strode down the runway.

She was slightly disgusted by the idea, but preferred to speak of her admiration for the model for pulling it off.

Even the ‘uniboot’ from French footwear designer Christian Louboutin won admiring comments even though wearers would be expected to hop along in the invented fashion item.

Kimmel had begun the ‘Lie Witness News’ section by commenting how New York Fashion Week was really just an opportunity for designers to play a practical joke on the women of America with the outlandishness of some of the ensembles that they sent down the runways.
