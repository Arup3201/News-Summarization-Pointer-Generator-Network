Three college friends from Iowa who spotted a buck trapped in a sinkhole on their way to a football game were struck by pangs of guilt as they drove on by so decided to turn around and save the deer.

Before attempting their selfless rescue mission, Gavin Nimrod, Eric Smorstad and Bryton Meyer made a pit-stop at Wal-Mart to get rope and clips and made their way back to the field owned by Eric's father.

Once there the friends made quick work of the task at hand, pulling the deer out of the 10-foot-deep hole using only a rope and their bare hands.

Rescuers: The three friends assess the situation after to save the buck which had fallen down the sinkhole

Obviously the antlers and the scared deer made their rescue dangerous, so the friends had to work a slip knot to the deer which would come free once they had pulled it out of its hole.

'I was almost down to my knees reaching down in there, so they jumped on my legs to keep me from falling in,' said Nimrod, 20, to the Des Moines Register.

'It was just something you don't get the opportunity to do, rescue a deer. So you get the chance and you take it.'

Meyer positioned his smartphone onto the truck to record the rescue, which happened last month.

The three friends later posted the footage onto YouTube and it has been viewed more than 30,000 times since.

The friends managed to yank the startled buck up by its antlers inch by inch, taking care to position themselves away from the deer so that they could run if it charged.

Once it reached the top it darted right then left and bolted away, leaving its amused rescuers shouting at the top of their voices at their own effort.

'The animal was in distress. These kids took a shot at it and in this case you've got to say they did the right thing,' said Joe Wilkinson, an Iowa Department of Natural Resources spokesman to the Des Moines Register.

According to the Des Moines Register, two of the men are in fact deer hunters, but they said in fact, that was what made them rescue the deer.

'Either one of us would have taken it if we had the opportunity to, so we wanted to let it live,' Nimrod said.

'It was the most fun we've had since we won the state in football.'
