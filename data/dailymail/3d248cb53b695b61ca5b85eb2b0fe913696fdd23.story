It's not only new pencil cases, shirts, blazers, caps, lunch boxes and PE kits that Britain's mums have been preoccupied with over the last few weeks. Autumn fashion sprees, blow-drys and fake tans are also high on mothers' 'to-do' lists for the start of the new academic year. 

A new survey has revealed that fashion and beauty comes high on the agenda for back to school preparation with 64 per cent of mothers admitted they'd bought a new outfit for the new year and 76 per cent arranged 
beauty appointments and treatments to coincide with their children's first day back.

What type of school-run mum are you? 64% say they buy outfits for the school-gate fashion parade

Boots, knitwear, and coats were the most
 popular items purchased, according to Debenhams survey. The store has 
reported a 160 per cent increase in womenswear over the last month with winter 
scarves, boots flying off the shelves. They've also found a 16 per cent increase
 in handbag sales.

In recent years celebrity mums such as Elle Macpherson, Myleene Klass, Samantha Cameron and Claudia Schiffer, who have all been photographed looking glamorous while taking their children to school, which has brought the spotlight on the school gate fashion-parade phenomenon.

There are also a plethora of fashion bloggers specialising in school-run outfits. Along with her new term fashion snaps, one such blogger Susiesosoblogspot recently posted, 'Who says you’ve got to stop caring what you look like after 
you’ve had children?'. Another, Poppystyle, says: 'I need to feel like a 
woman as well as a Mom and why should I subscribe to the sweat pants 
every day brigade?'

But not all mums are so keen to join the parade, with one recent thread on Netmums asking, 'So who is dreading the school gate fashion parade?', with several mums bemoaning the 'judgemental' nature of the school gates and
 asking for tips on what to wear, while others saying they 'don't give a 
monkeys'.

But according to the survey, over eight 
out of ten (82 per cent) mums who do the school run admitted they had planned 
'either the night before or earlier', what they were going to wear for 
the first day of term drop-off.

When it comes to hair and beauty, 76 per cent of mothers said they had arranged appointments and treatments to coincide with them looking their best for the start of term, including using self-tanning lotion, having fake tans, waxing, hair-colouring, highlights, hair-cuts and a blow-dry.

Hair salon, Regis reported a 16 per cent  increase in hair colouring appointments in the run up to the start of the school year.

The most popular items purchased by mums in the survey were:1. Knitwear2. Jeans3. Scarf4. Coat/trench coat5. Boots

A whopping 83 per cent of mums said they would be wearing make-up to the school gates and half said they had bought a new item of make-up they would be using.

Geography also seems to play a part in mums school-gate fashion habits. The biggest fashion followers were in the South East and the West Country. In the North West mums concentrated on hair and make-up. New jeans were especially popular in the East Midlands.

The retailer commissioned the study after
 seeing a surge in sales of women’s clothing and hair and beauty 
products in the weeks leading up to the first week of September and the 
start of a new academic year for UK schools.

A spokesperson for Debenhams said: 'Obviously we see a jump in back-to-school clothing for children, but we are now also seeing a rise in categories of womenswear, footwear and beauty lines as well.

'Some women are going for whole new outfits to wear to the school-gates, while others are just opting for one of two things like a new jacket, or skirt.

'Of course many of these items will also be for the office but it seems that the September back to school period triggers a wardrobe and make-up-bag revamp for mothers across the board.'

However, for those who are a little less well put together on some mornings, you are not alone, 9 per cent of mums confessed that on at least one occasion in the past they had worn an item of sleepwear or slippers when dropping their children to school.
