It wasn’t exactly the Mediterranean – but after a seemingly endless winter yesterday’s warm weather was a good start.

As predicted, it was the hottest day of the year so far with the thermometer peaking at 22C (72F) in Gravesend and Manton in Kent.

It is hoped the widespread temperature increase will jolt Mother Nature out of her unusually long hibernation.

Bluebells and some daffodils, which 
normally brighten the countryside and gardens with displays of colour, 
have yet to flower, while parks await the glorious burst of cherry 
blossom.

As for the bird population, there are 
fears that a lack of insects may have had terrible consequences for the 
tens of thousands of migrating birds that usually reach Britain by the 
start of April.

Some birds may have delayed their 
journey north, but ornithologists fear thousands of birds that rely on 
insects for food may have arrived and died.

The National Trust was expecting the 
‘main pulse’ of migrating birds – including swallows and house martins –
to arrive over the weekend with the help of strong southerly winds.

But Grahame Madge of the RSPB said: 
‘We’re actually not sure where they all are. Possibly many have already 
arrived and perished or they may be hanging around waiting for the right
conditions.’

He added: ‘When they arrive they are 
exhausted. They have probably lost half their body weight and are right 
on the edge of survival.

‘If they arrive and there are no insects to feed on they are in big trouble. We could be looking at a bleak picture.’

Bluebells are one wonder of the British countryside that have yet to appear.

It is thought peak flowering could be 
delayed until mid-May this year. There are also fears that many 
daffodils may not flower at all.

Tom Price, curator of Oxford 
University’s Botanic Garden, said: ‘It’s possible the bulbs have been 
damaged by the prolonged wet, and then very cold weather. Some of them 
could have rotted or died off in the soil.’

However, experts suggest the late spring could be a sign of an increasingly rare hot summer.

Matthew Oates, a naturalist for the 
National Trust, said: ‘There is a really good link between late springs 
and very good summers, and we are due, overdue, a very good summer.’

A Met Office spokesman said: ‘Temperatures will drop a bit tomorrow but it will stay generally mild.’
