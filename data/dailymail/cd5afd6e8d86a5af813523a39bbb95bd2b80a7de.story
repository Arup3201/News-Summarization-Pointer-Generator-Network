Prince Harry is set to receive £10million of his mother's fortune on his 30th birthday next month.

The inheritance, stipulated in the will of his mother Diana, Princess of Wales, is the same as that received by his older brother Prince William on his 30th birthday in 2012.

However, the total amount he will receive is expected to be more than that of his brother due to the accumulated interest in the past two years.

The money comes from a trust fund bequeathed to her two sons at the time of her death in 1997.

In her original will, drawn up in 1993, the princess had stipulated that both princes would be entitled to their entire share of the capital on reaching 25.

Prince William also received £10million inheritance on his 30th birthday two years ago, but his brother is expected to receive more due to the accumulated interest

But details of the will were changed by a variation order granted by the High Court on December 19, 1997 - three months after her premature death in a Paris car crash.

Her estate comprised stocks and shares, jewellery, cash from her £17million divorce settlement, dresses and other personal belongings at her Kensington Palace apartment.

Diana stipulated that it would be held in trust to be shared equally between her two sons, even though William will inherit income from the Duchy of Cornwall estate when he becomes Prince of Wales.

Prince Harry, who in recent months broke up with his girlfriend Cressida Bonas and turns 30 on September 15, currently earns £38,847 a year as an Army captain.

The hard partying prince currently lives a stone’s-throw from his childhood home, at Nottingham Cottage, a two-bedroom house with its own front garden opposite Kate and William’s Apartment 1A in Kensington Palace.

The inheritance payout is just part of a series of items and a fortune which is handed over to the princes once they both turn 30.

Her now famous wedding dress, which has been in the possession of her brother Earl Spencer since her death, will also be transferred into their possession.

Lord Spencer said her will stated the 
dress and a number of other dresses and belongings were to be 'looked 
after' by him until both the boys turned 30.

The dress has recently been the centrepiece of the exhibition Diana: A Celebration.

For two months every year it was held at Althorp, the family's Northamptonshire estate. For the rest of the year the exhibition moved from country to country.

It was most recently displayed at the Cincinnati Museum Center in America.
