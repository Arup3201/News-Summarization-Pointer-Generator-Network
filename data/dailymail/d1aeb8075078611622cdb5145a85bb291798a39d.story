A Russian prostitute accused of murdering a wealthy retired accountant at his £1m home has tearfully told a jury how he had terrified her by locking her inside his house on previous occasions.

Natalia Woolley, 38, said she had to climb out of a window of the four-bedroom detached property in Surrey at least once to escape 69-year-old Winston Fernandez.

Widowed father-of-two Mr Fernandez, of 
Epsom, Surrey, was found with 17 broken ribs and smashed 
bones in his windpipe on February 17.

'Alluring to all men': Natalia Woolley, 38, who described 
herself on escort websites as 'incredibly sexy 
and curvacious', is accused of killing 69-year-old Winston Fernandez - who wanted to marry her, a court heard

His corpse was found almost a month after he was killed, by police who were called to the property by worried neighbours.

Giving evidence at her trial, Woolley, who denies murder, said she only agreed to visit him again in exchange for a promise that he would never lock his front door again while she was there.

In a police interview she said Mr Fernandez locked her into his house, demanded she perform oral sex on him as well as other sexual acts and attacked her by pinning her down and grabbing her legs.

Woolley told jurors that she was trying to fight off Mr Fernandez when he grabbed her during a fight.

'He was so aggressive when he started to behave in that way. I couldn't see a way out. He didn't let me out. He started to grab my legs. I don't know, I just wanted to get away from him,' she told the court.

Trial: Ms Woolley claimed when she arrived at his home he fell over heavily on at least three occasions and he had blood on him

Asked by David Lederman QC, of the 
defence, if she was trying to escape, Woolley replied: 'Yes. He was a 
dangerous. I couldn't understand what he was doing. He was not in a 
normal state ... he was drunk. I had to leave from there. I just wanted 
to go.'

In a police interview read to the 
court, Woolley said she slipped and landed on Mr Fernandez after he 
lifted his head as he lay on the floor.

The court heard that Woolley 
repeatedly asked her friend Kevin Markey to call Mr Fernandez's home in 
the days following the incident.

She also tried to enlist the help of some of her clients by asking them to drive her to Epsom.

One of them refused to get involved 
after she told him that she needed to go to the Surrey address 'to see 
if someone was alive', but another man did agree to drive her there on 
January 22.

Woolley, wearing a pink scarf and 
long-sleeved black top, broke down in tears as she was asked why she 
requested that Mr Markey delete text and Skype messages they exchanged 
following her fight with Mr Fernandez.

She also called her mobile phone provider 3 to ask if it was possible that her iPhone could be traced, the court heard.

'If I worried about this I would have probably deleted all my text messages and all my messages on Skype, ' she said.

Guildford Crown Court heard that the
defendant went on holiday to Tenerife and visited her daughter in 
Russia after Mr Fernandez's death, before returning to the UK where she 
was arrested

The trial has already heard how the 
pensioner had spent his money on escort girls and had developed a 
fixation with Woolley who was one of a number of prostitutes who visited
him.

Mr Fernandez was planning to ask Woolley to marry him, a jury had heard.

But
he was intending to give her a strict ultimatum - that she would have 
to give up being a call girl if they wed, it was claimed.

Weeping
at times and her voice breaking with emotion, Woolley, a former student
at Hammersmith College, London, who had a passion for art and 
photography, said Mr Fernandez was not an easy client.

Court: Ms Woolley said that she stepped over 
the pensioner as he was on the ground but in the scuffle that followed 
she stumbled and her leg landed on his head. She said 'I fell on top of him'

'He was drunk every time I saw him. On various occasions, he locked me in and hid the keys,' she said.

'So I had to escape from a window,' added Woolley.

Woolley said
she had extracted a guarantee from him in advance that he would never 
lock her inside in future, on the night Mr Fernandez is alleged to have 
died.

'I said what happened must never happen again. He promised not to lock me in again so I went round there,' she said.

But she said when she arrived at his home, he fell over heavily on at least three occasions and he had blood on him.

She
said he brandished a wine bottle at her before trying to smash a beer 
bottle over the table leaving her fearful of being blinded by flying 
glass.

Jurors heard that he accused her of taking his money and not doing anything for him.

Scene: Woolley is accused of murdering 69-year-old Winston Fernandez after he invited her to his £1million mansion (above) in Epsom, Surrey. She is accused of kicking and stamping the widower to death

The £600-a-night prostitute told the court: 'He said to me, "I paid you the money and you didn’t do anything".'

She revealed to the court she was so terrified that she decided to leave as soon as possible.

She said that she made for the front door but found that it was locked.

'I said, "Open the door otherwise I shall shout and scream".'

She explained that he then asked her for sex, saying: 'You’ve not done any service.'

Woolley said she went upstairs after he promised to unlock the front door.

The court heard that Mr Fernandez demanded certain sex acts but said she refused.

The defendant told the jury that the pensioner started to undo his trousers before grabbing her and forcing her on to the bed.

'He hit me on the back and I felt 
something on my head. He was very angry because he couldn’t get what he 
wanted. So he started throwing things about,' she said.

She said that Mr Fernandez then fell very heavily.

After
that, she said, he had grabbed her leg and tried to stop her escaping 
and she kicked him four or five times in the midriff.

She denied hitting Mr Fernandez with a chair.

'I was stressed and I was panicking. I was so shaken that I didn’t know what to do,' she added.

The defendant said she then left the house after cutting his phone wires to stop him calling her again and walked to a nearby garage where she called a cab to take her back to her home in London.

Woolley, of West Kensington, London, denies murder.

The trial continues.
