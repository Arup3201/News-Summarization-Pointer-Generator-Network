The moment Karlie Kloss's hair was dramatically chopped short has been pictured for the first time.

The supermodel, 20, who previously had very long dark blonde locks, had it cut into a long bob on a shoot for U.S. Vogue on November 5.

The cut was done by  by stylist-to-the-stars Garren on a shoot with Patrick Demarchelier, for a feature about 'the cut of the moment'.

However cool, it was ill-timed for 
Victoria's Secret though. Miss Kloss, the lingerie giant's newest Angel, was due to walk its catwalk show just two days later and stylists were forced to hide her
cropped new do with long hair extensions, so that her look was in keeping with that of the other girls.

Like many of us would be, the model was excited yet nervous as she prepared to say goodbye seven inches of her locks.

She admitted to the magazine that she still had 'should I or shouldn’t I?' jitters as she arrived at the studio.

New look: Miss Kloss (pictured in October, left, and December, right) was known for her almost-waist-length locks - but she adores her new look, and described it as 'very French'

Under wraps: Just two days after her dramatic haircut, the supermodel walked the Victoria's Secret catwalk show, with her short hair obscured by long layers of hair extensions

'I haven’t had short hair since the second grade,' she said. 'It was a bob with bangs - and let me tell you, that was not a 
fabulous cut.'

The article appears in the January 2013 issue of Vogue, on newsstands from December 25

She was in safe hands though. Garren has been styling the hair of the world's most beautiful women since the Seventies.

He referenced Jane Birkin and Jean Shrimpton for Miss Kloss's new do, a look, he insists, would work on any face shape.

'We want 
it to be something short, choppy, easy, and chic, but with a 
rock-’n’-roll edge,' he said.

Naturally, Garren delivered exactly that, and the cut was pronounced a hit by Miss Kloss.

'I feel very French!' she said. 'I’m going to have to 
get used to looking cooler.'

Mr Demarchelier also approved, telling her: 'Fantastique. You look really more 
chic, Karlie.'

It is apparently low-maintenance too. Styling is as simple as: 'wash it, tuck it behind your ears, and let it air-dry,' Garren insists.

'It will look 
just as good with jeans as it does with a Tom Ford evening dress.'
