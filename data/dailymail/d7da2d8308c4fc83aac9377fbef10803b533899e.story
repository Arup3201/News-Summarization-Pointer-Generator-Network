If you ever wanted a definition of what ‘aghast’ looks like, here’s a handy lesson courtesy of Prince Charles.

The prince pulled the rather vivid facial expression as he mingled with guests at a Clarence House reception to honour members of the nursing profession.

Yet by rights, they should have been the ones looking shocked. Because he had just told a group of respiratory nurses about his childhood vice – smoking behind a chicken coop when he was at school.

Nurse and secondary school teacher Paul Watson, 39, from Peterborough said afterwards: ‘There was a few of us that are respiratory nurses and he asked whether we deal with a lot of smokers.

‘He said, "I gave up at 11 when I had a few cigarettes behind a chicken coop."

‘I believe it was tongue in cheek.’

It’s not the first time the prince had admitted to trying a crafty ciggie.

In November 1998 he made the same confession to schoolchildren on an official visit to Slovenia.

Prince Charles asked pupils at the Martin Krpan School in Ljubljana whether they had ever tried smoking - and about half of the 28 pupils taking part in the seminar with him said they had.

‘I gave up smoking at the age of 11,’ said Prince Charles. ‘I had one or two strong ones behind the chicken run at school. The good thing is to give them up when you are young.’

The Slovenian pupils, told what the prince had said by a translator, burst into laughter.

Blaz Bhaklar, 11, said he had read that U.S. President Bill Clinton had tried smoking marijuana. The prince replied: ‘Don't believe everything you read in the newspapers.’

Charles would have been at Cheam preparatory school in Berkshire at the time he was talking about. He hinted that in trying cigarettes he had bowed to peer pressure from his classmates.

A spokesman at Clarence House declined to comment further today.

But in previous years they have suggested that the prince’s wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, who was once rather a heavy smoker, has given up.

Tribute: The Prince wrote an article in Nursing Times praising the contribution nurses make to public health

In a Q&A session on its website 
it says, 'Q. Are the reports that The Duchess is still a smoker true? A:
No. The Duchess of Cornwall gave up smoking many years ago.'

However Charles's son, Prince Harry, has long been an unapologetic smoker.

The prince’s remarks were made at a reception he hosted to pay tribute to the nominees of the Nursing Times annual awards.

Charles
hailed the dedication and hard work of the nation's nurses, saying they
give 'exceptional care' to patients across the country.

Writing
in the Nursing Times ahead of the magazine's awards ceremony, he said 
he believed nurses' care and kindness was 'vital' and stressed the 
importance of a holistic approach to those who are sick.

Charles,
who is patron of more than 30 healthcare organisations, said his visits
to hospitals over the past 40 years had shown him just how pivotal a 
role nurses play.

He wrote: 'In all these instances, 
together with many others, it was abundantly clear to me just how 
important the emotional connection between patients and skilled, 
hard-working nurses actually was.

'In
general, quite apart from the medical expertise that nursing staff 
provide on a daily and nightly basis, the reassurance and simple human 
kindness that they can also dispense is, I believe, vital and must 
surely impact positively on the recovery of individuals.

'Human kindness, reassurance and sympathy are age-old qualities, yet they are as important today as they have ever been.

'The
Nursing Times Awards recognise this, as well as the importance of a 
holistic approach - treating the whole person, rather than just the 
symptoms of disease.

'When
this approach is combined with the best of conventional medicine, and 
adopted by the whole healthcare team, with scrupulous attention to every
aspect of the patient's personal, medical and nursing needs, great 
progress can be made.'

Health campaigners said today that while they could not comment on the prince’s remarks directly, the issue of children taking up smoking was one of deep concern.

Indeed, laws to allow the Secretary of State powers to introduce standard packaging for tobacco products sold in places to which children have access are expected to be debated in the House of Lords next month.

Dr Penny Woods, Chief Executive of the British Lung Foundation, told the Mail that 80 per cent of smokers admitted starting in their teens.

‘It may be a number of years since Prince Charles tried smoking as a child, but sadly children smoking is not just a concern of the past. Indeed, more than 200,000 children in the UK start smoking every year,’ she said

‘And while His Royal Highness may not have continued to smoke into adulthood, we know that many children do – in fact over 80 per cent of smokers started in their teens, with almost 40 per cent starting before the age of 16.

‘With parliament due to discuss the issue in the coming weeks, Prince Charles’ admission is a timely reminder that we still need to explore new initiatives for protecting children from the dangers of smoking.

‘Measures such as introducing compulsory standardised packaging for all tobacco products will help prevent tobacco companies from marketing cigarettes to children, and cut the number of children taking up this deadly habit.’
