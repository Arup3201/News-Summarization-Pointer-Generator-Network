Two years on from his shocking collapse against Sergio Garcia at the Ryder Cup, and Jim Furyk is still getting asked about it. ‘Every time I go to the Press room, I know the questions are coming and I feel like we’re in a morgue,’ he says.

Never mind that he has career earnings of more than $60 million (£37m), will make his ninth consecutive appearance in the biennial match at Gleneagles next week and, at 44, looks up at only six fellow professionals in the world rankings.

‘Everyone is looking at me with this blank stare and they ask me depressing questions,’ he added. ‘And they bring up the Ryder Cup the last time, and we go through Akron (he doubled the 18th hole in 2012 to lose the Bridgestone Invitational) and I leave there feeling like I lost my dog. It’s golf. No one died. I don’t expect anyone to feel sorry for me.’

As you might gather, Furyk in conversation is every bit as straight as one of his drives — and you can understand the slight irritation at the recurring theme. He is, after all, the great survivor of world golf, a man defying ridiculous odds.

It is eight years since he was asked whether the game was passing him by. It was a reference to his struggle with his funky swing and being a medium hitter in the era of the power game. He’s certainly answered that one. Eight years on, just two players finished above him when it came to making this American team.

‘I’m very proud to represent my country and when I look back on my career and the things I’ve done, making nine teams means an awful lot,’ he said. ‘You have to be consistent and to be able to qualify by right for eight of them, to be in the mix that often, I’m proud of that.’

The Garcia question keeps coming up, of course, because of the extra-ordinary circumstances. Furyk was one up with two holes to play against the Spaniard on the final day in Chicago but bogeyed them both to make his own unfortunate contribution to the miracle of Medinah.

Captain Davis Love had picked him as a wild card and Furyk was devastated when he didn’t deliver. 

‘I think if you ask Sergio he would agree I outplayed him but it doesn’t matter if you don’t win the point,’ he said. ‘I think I was the most disappointed of our team because I felt bad for Davis. He got everything right as captain but quite honestly we laid an egg on Sunday and the Europeans got the momentum.’

You might expect him to be leading from the front alongside some of his more excitable colleagues such as Keegan Bradley in declaring this forthcoming visit to Scotland a mission of redemption. But Furyk has been down that road before, putting pressure on himself, and he knows it doesn’t work for him.

It’s exactly four years, for example, since he claimed the last of his 16 victories in the 2010 Tour Championship in Atlanta. Since then, he has led eight tournaments going into the final round and not once has he ended up with the trophy. ‘Some of them have been taken away from me by people playing great final rounds but I’ve got in my own way a few times as well,’ he conceded.

Furyk bristled when BBC Five Live golf correspondent Iain Carter asked him last week if this team was more pumped up than previous American sides. ‘Any other clichés you want to throw at me?’ he replied. ‘Are the Europeans more of a team, and we’re just individuals, perhaps?’ Earlier, he had given a more considered response.

‘If it was the same 12 players against their 12 then yes, it would be a lot of motivation,’ he said. ‘The Yankees lose to the Red Sox 3-0 then yes, the next time they meet it’s a big deal. But this is going to be a different group of guys and it’s two years later and also, I don’t think you ever need motivation to play in the Ryder Cup. Every team I’ve played in, the motivation has been the same.’ 

Furyk still considers it his favourite event, even though he’s only been on two winning teams. ‘Three-six would sound an awful lot better than two-seven, wouldn’t it?’ he said, smiling.

‘I just love the whole atmosphere. I remember losing one match to Ian Poulter and Graeme McDowell on the final green but I still loved it. They hung tough at the end, and you can have no complaints when that happens.

‘I like the friendships I’ve made and the spirit in which the matches are generally played. I remember competing against Darren Clarke and Lee Westwood in 2006. I had a short putt and someone said pick it up and I wasn’t quite sure what they said and Darren gave me this look that said, “Come on Jim, you know better than that, there’s nothing goofy going to happen in this group”.

‘I’ve made some good friendships over the years with Europeans like Darren and Lee. But it is true we’ve been on the losing side rather more than I would have liked.’

He has a good relationship with the British crowd, too, and is looking forward to the European songs. ‘They’re a great part of the occasion,’ he said. ‘My favourite was at Celtic Manor when you couldn’t see the fairway and the fans started singing, “Follow your nose, Jim”. I could barely hit my tee shot I was laughing so hard.’

Look to Furyk to be a formidable presence in the two foursomes series and a vital member of the American team room. And he knows exactly what needs to happen to prevent the press room feeling like a morgue.

‘I’m not chastising the press or anything, y’all have been very fair to me over the years,’ he said. ‘I understand the questions. I guess I just want to get away from having a sad conversation all the time, and walk out of there feeling happy.

‘I guess we have to win, right? So if and when that happens, I’ll be the one with a big smile on my face.’
