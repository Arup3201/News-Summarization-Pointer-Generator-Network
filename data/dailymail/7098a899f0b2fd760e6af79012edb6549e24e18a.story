The U.S. Attorney's Office for
the District of Columbia will not pursue criminal charges
against John Hinckley Jr. for the death of former White House
press secretary James Brady, the prosecutor's office said on
Friday.

Brady was gravely wounded in 1981 when Hinckley tried to
assassinate President Ronald Reagan in Washington. 

He was
incapacitated from the shooting for the rest of his life and
died in August at 73.

A Virginia medical examiner then controversially ruled Brady's death a murder,
sparking an investigation by District of Columbia police into the shooting 33 years earlier.

No charges: The death  of former White House press secretary James Brady, who was shot during an attempted assassination against President Reagan in 1981, was ruled a homicide in August, but prosecutors now say shooter John Hinckley Jr. will not face any charges

Attack: This photograph from March, 1980, shows a U.S. secret service agent with an automatic weapon watching over James Brady (center and Washington DC police officer, Thomas Delahanty, left) the president's secretary, after being wounded in an attempt on the life of President Ronald Reagan in Washington

Assassination attempt: Secret Service agent Timothy J. McCarthy, Washington policeman Thomas K. Delehanty, and White House press secretary, James Brady, lie wounded after shots were fired at Reagan

Reagan, a police officer and a Secret Service agent also were
wounded in the attack.

Since a jury in 1982 found Hinckley not guilty by reason of
insanity, prosecutors could not argue that he was sane when he
shot Brady, the U.S. Attorney's Office said in a statement today.

In addition, before 1987 District of Columbia courts abided
by the 'year and a day rule,' under which homicide charges could
only be brought if the victim died within a year and a day of
the injury causing death, the statement said.

After he was shot, Brady became a gun control activist. 

Hinckley has been in a mental hospital since the shooting.

The prosect of him being charged over Brady's death was always unlikely, experts said.

'I think it (the medical examiner's ruling) will mean nothing,' long-time Hinckley attorney Barry Levine said in August following his client's death. 

'No prosecutors will bring such a case. 

'The notion that this could be a successful prosecution is far-fetched. 

'There is no legal basis to pursue this.' 

No charges: John Hinckley Jr - pictured taking a stroll near his mother's house earlier this year - was found not guilty of attempted assassination by reason of insanity

A court 
had recently ruled that he could spend 17 days a month with his family 
in Virginia, but a judge warned at the time that he still 'exhibits 
deceptive behavior'.

As
 part of a carefully monitored program, the 58-year-old is allowed to 
stay on an exclusive gated estate set among the lush greens of a golf 
course near Williamsburg, Virginia.

Hinckley
 was in his 20s when he fired several shots at President Reagan outside a
 hotel on March 31, 1981, apparently in an attempt to get the attention 
of Jodie Foster.

One bullet missed the President's heart by about an inch, and he lost nearly half his body's blood supply.

Campaign: After the attack, which left Brady - pictured with his wife Sarah in 2011 - paralyzed, he became an advocate for gun control

Three others, including Brady who was hit in the head by a bullet, were seriously wounded.

The press secretary was left paralyzed on the left side of his body and later dedicated his life to gun control by starting the Brady Campaign which has been the most vocal campaign to outlaw assault weapons.

Police officer Thomas Delahanty and Secret Service agent Timothy McCarthy recovered from their wounds.
