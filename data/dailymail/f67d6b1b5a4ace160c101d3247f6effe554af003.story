A 2,625ft-long drug-smuggling tunnel discovered running under the Mexican border has been described by police as the 'most sophisticated ever'.

The tunnel scheme, which links warehouses in San Diego and Tijuana, even has a hydraulic lift to take people and contraband underground.

It is the latest in a spate of secret passages found smuggling drugs from Mexico into the U.S.

'It is clearly the most sophisticated tunnel we have ever found,' said Lauren Mack, a spokesman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in San Diego.

Mexican soldiers found the entrance on the south side of the border at a Tijuana warehouse, near the airport, after the U.S. opening was discovered on Tuesday.

The Tijuana warehouse is on the same block as a federal police office and sits next to a packaging company and tortilla distributor.

This discovery comes less than two weeks after U.S. authorities found a 400-yard passage linking warehouses in San Diego and Tijuana, seizing 17 tons of marijuana on both sides of the border.

It was equipped with lighting and ventilation.

As U.S. authorities heighten enforcement on land, tunnels have emerged as a major tack to smuggle marijuana.

More than 70 have been found on the border since October 2008, surpassing the number of discoveries in the previous six years.

Many are clustered around San Diego, California’s Imperial Valley and Nogales, Ariz.

California is popular because its clay-like soil is easy to dig with shovels.

In Nogales, smugglers tap into vast underground drainage canals.

Authorities said they found a drug tunnel in Nogales, running from a drain in Mexico to a rented house on the U.S. side.

San
Diego’s Otay Mesa area has the added draw that there are plenty of 
warehouses on both sides of the border to conceal trucks getting loaded 
with drugs. Its streets hum with semitrailers by day and fall silent on 
nights and weekends.

Raids last November on two tunnels linking San Diego and Tijuana netted a combined 52 tons of marijuana on both sides of the border, ranking among the largest pot busts in U.S. history. Those secret passages were lined with rail tracks, lighting and ventilation.

On Monday, a Mexican man was 
sentenced to nearly 16 years in prison for his role in last November’s 
tunnels. Prosecutors described Daniel Navarro, 45, as a significant 
player in moving marijuana from the San Diego warehouse and sought a 
30-year prison sentence.

U.S.
District Judge Larry Burns said Navarro, a legal U.S. resident since 
1999 who worked as a trucker in Southern California, was 'up to his 
hips' in smuggling the large marijuana loads.

'This is just a gigantic amount of marijuana,' Burns said.
