A new app will let strangers polish off each other’s half-eaten meals. From half a pizza to the dregs of a soup bowl, nothing is off-limits.

Launching worldwide next week, the LeftoverSwap app lets people ‘check in’ and browse their local offerings.

Once you find something that lights up your tastebuds, get in touch and arrange your doggy bag. The team behind it believe it could help fight food poverty.

APPetising? LeftoverSwap lets people check in 
and see the half-eaten meals left by their neighbours - then arrange to 
polish them off. Its creators think that it will help combat food 
poverty, an increasing problem

Creator Dan Newman, 25, said: 'It started out as a joke three years ago. My friend and I had a bunch of leftover pizza and we said how great it would be if someone could just finish it off for us.

'Early this year we remembered it in passing, and for some reason it seemed so much more plausible in 2013.

'So we started doing it in our free time, which would take a while because building an app is amazingly complicated.

'But the feedback we’ve had has been great - people seem really into it - so we decided to give this a proper shot.'

It is not just a gimmick, Mr Newman claims, with globally rocketing food prices driving people into food banks - if not starvation.

Mr Newman, a finance reporter from Seattle, said: 'When you first think of leftovers, you think of soggy bits on a plate. It doesn’t have to be that - it could be cans you don’t want.

'Like in the UK, we have millions of people suffering from food poverty in the States. There were 20million in 2008, now there are 40million.

'But still, to be honest, if someone cut a sandwich in half, I would happily take the other half.'
