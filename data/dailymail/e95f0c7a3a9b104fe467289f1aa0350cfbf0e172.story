Labour will lose the election if it allows Ed Miliband to be pitted against David Cameron in a presidential-style contest, John Prescott warned yesterday.

The former deputy prime minister said Labour had to ‘run as a party’, rather than relying on its struggling leader, who could cost it the election.

Lord Prescott, who has previously criticised the ‘pointy-heads’ running Labour’s campaign, suggested the party still had to explain to voters ‘what we stand for’.

Asked whether it was in good shape ahead of the election, he said: ‘It could be in better shape and I think it’s working to it. It’s seen that they've got to get over to people and convince them.’

In a frank admission of Mr Miliband's personal unpopularity with the voters, he added: ‘Don’t run, Ed, as a president – you won’t win.

‘Run as a party so people can understand what we stand for and what our values are.’

Tory strategists are determined to run a presidential-style campaign that offers voters a straight choice between Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband as prime minister.

A YouGov poll at the weekend found that 40 per cent of voters think Mr Cameron is doing a good job, while 52 per cent do not, giving him a net satisfaction rating of minus 12.

By contrast, just 18 per cent of people said Mr Miliband was doing a good job, compared to 70 per cent who said he was not – giving the Labour leader a net satisfaction rating of minus 52.

Lord Prescott’s intervention came as former prime minister Tony Blair renewed his veiled criticism of Mr Miliband, saying Labour needed a ‘strong’ leader to win.

Labour floundered yesterday on how it would plug Britain’s huge budget deficit – suggesting higher fees for gun owners.

Chancellor George Osborne said Labour seemed not to want ‘to mention the deficit at all’ and challenged it to spell out tax rises it would bring in.

Labour’s plan to soften spending cuts if it wins the election would mean borrowing up to £50billion a year more by 2020 than the Tories, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, risking adding £170billion to the national debt by 2030.

The main parties last night agreed to back a new Charter of Budget Responsibility, which will mean billions more pounds being wiped off spending.

Mr Osborne said he would not raise taxes, but save £13billion from Whitehall departments and £12billion from welfare, and £5billion from reduced tax avoidance to balance the books. But Chris Leslie, Labour’s Treasury spokesman, struggled to explain how the party could sign up to the charter while not setting out cuts or tax rises.

He could only name Labour’s plan to increase the top rate of tax to 50p and £17.2million extra from ‘gun licence changes’ – money already promised to the police.

A Tory spokesman said: ‘This shows the total chaos in Labour’s economic policy.’

Mr Blair said it would be up to the electorate voters to decide whether Mr Miliband had the necessary leadership qualities to be prime minister.

But in a lukewarm endorsement of the man who hopes to follow in his footsteps and return Labour to power, the ex-premier said voters would make up their own minds about whether Mr Miliband had a ‘problem’.

Interviewed by BBC political editor Nick Robinson as part of a new Radio 4 series called Can Democracy Work?, Mr Blair repeatedly said that firm leadership was the key to success.

With Labour failing to establish a clear lead in opinion polls, Mr Blair was asked what Mr Miliband's ‘problem’ was.

‘I'm not sure he has got a problem. That’ll be for the people to choose. I'm Labour Party and I’ll be backing him.’

Tony Blair issued a thinly-veiled warning that Labour needs to show strong leadership in the run-up to the election

Last month, Mr Blair was forced to issue a ‘clarification’ after apparently suggesting he expected Mr Miliband to lose the election after dragging the Labour Party to the Left.

In an interview with the Economist, Mr Blair said the election could be one ‘in which a traditional Left-wing party competes with a traditional Right-wing party, with the traditional result’.

Asked if he meant a Tory win, Mr Blair replied: ‘Yes, that is what happens.’

The following day, Mr Blair said his remarks had been ‘misinterpreted’, and insisted he hoped and expected Mr Miliband would win.
