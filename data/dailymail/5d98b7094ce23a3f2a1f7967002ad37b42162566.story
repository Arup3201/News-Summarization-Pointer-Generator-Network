Fox News’ psychiatry contributor Dr. Keith Ablow argued on Tuesday that Michelle Obama shouldn’t be preaching to anyone about healthy eating because ‘she needs to drop a few’ herself.

Ablow was taking part in a debate on the Outnumbered show about the first lady’s ongoing campaign to get American children eating healthier when he attacked over her size.

‘How well could she be eating? She needs to drop a few. Let’s be honest. We’re taking nutrition advice from who?’ he asked.

His four female co-hosts were all stunned by his outburst.

‘You did not just say that,' said Harris Faulkner. 'Oh, my goodness. Are we on a seven-second delay?'

But Dr. Ablow was on a role. 'I want nutrition,' he continued, 'but let's be honest, there's no french fries happening? It's all kale and carrots? I don't buy it. Just saying.'

At one point co-anchor Kennedy interjected to say that she like Mrs. Obama's figure. 'I like her booty,' she said.

Disappointed that no one else would agree with him, Ablow could be heard to say 'Join me in my criticism.'

Co-host Sandra Smith refused to get drawn in. 'Fitness of the First Lady aside, her presentation aside, I have no comments on that,' she said.

The first lady is 5 foot 11 and is estimated to weight 170 pounds, which means her BMI is 23.7 and is therefore within the normal weight category.

Ablow then attempted to backtrack by adding that perhaps the President would be a better source of nutrition advice because he is skinny.

His outburst drew the ire of fellow Fox News presenter and meteorologist Janice Dean, reports Mediaite.

‘Dear @KeithAblow please keep your comments about women ‘dropping a few’ to yourself. Sincerely, all women.' she tweeted, before later deleting.

Fox regular Ablow is no stranger to controversy.

In April 2011, Ablow wrote a health column for FoxNews.com criticizing designer Jenna Lyons for publishing an advertisement in the J. Crew catalog in which she was depicted painting her young son's toenails hot pink.

Michelle Obama's campaign to encourage kid to be healthier was the subject of a debate on Fox News' Outnumbered on Tuesday which quickly descended into an attack on her size

Ablow wrote that gender distinctions are 'part of the magnificent synergy that creates and sustains the human race.'

Then during the 2012 Republican primary, he wrote a column arguing that Newt Gingrich's three marriages actually made him more qualified to be president.

'When three women want to sign on for life with a man who is now running for president, I worry more about whether we’ll be clamoring for a third Gingrich term, not whether we’ll want to let him go after one,' he wrote.

Ablow has also argued on Fox that gay adoption is 'narcissistic' and that polygmany 'has to be close behind' same sex marriage.

Fellow Fox News presenter Janice Dean voiced her disapproval of Ablow's remarks on Twitter before later deleting
