The owner of the New England Patriots has insisted his team is innocent over 'Deflate-gate' and has called on the NFL to apologize if its probe clears them.

Robert Kraft made the comments in Arizona yesterday where his team is preparing to face the Seattle Seahawks in the Super Super on Sunday.

Mr Kraft said he welcomes the investigation into accusations his team deflated footballs during the first half of their AFC Championship match against the Indianapolis Colts.

Kraft told a press conference in Arizona that he was confident the investigation would 'uncover the facts' and the science of how balls 'react to changes in the environment'

Kraft, seen above addressing a crowd at a send-off rally in Boston yesterday, referred to Belichick, right, and quarterback Tom Brady, left, as 'my guys' and said they were 'part of my family'; he said he had never known either man to 'lie'

Attorney Ted Wells is heading the investigation, along with NFL executive vice president Jeff Pash who previously conducted the league's probe of the Miami Dolphin's bullying scandal. 

'If the Wells investigation is not able to definitely determine that our organization tampered with the air pressure in the footballs, I would expect and hope that the league would apologize to our entire team, and in particular, Coach Belichick and Tom Brady, for what they have had to endure this past week,' Kraft is reported as saying to NBCNews.

Kraft said he was confident the investigation would 'uncover the facts' and the science of how balls 'react to changes in the environment'.  

He said the controversy has been fuelled by 'circumstantial leaked evidence' to the media and not 'actual data and facts', which has led to 'strong accusations' being made against Brady and  Belichick.

Those allegations, which called into questions his star quarterback and coaches' integrity, 'bothers me greatly', Kraft said.

Both Brady and Belichick have publicly denied that they knowingly broke league rules during the team's AFC Championship win over the Indianapolis Colts

Kraft said he believes 'unconditionally' that his team has done 'nothing inappropriate'.

Both Brady and Belichick have publicly denied that they knowingly broke league rules.

'Tom, Bill and I have been together for 15 years. They are my guys. They are part of my family. And Bill, Tom and I have had many difficult discussions over the years, and I have never known them to lie to me. That is why I am confident in saying what I just said, and it bothers me greatly that their reputations and integrity, and by association that of our team, has been called into question this past week,' Kraft told ESPN.

Brady said his team was not being distracted by the controversy in the lead-up to the Super Bowl saying it had dealt with a 'lot of adversity' this season and would continue to deal with it.

Meanwhile, it was revealed yesterday that the NFL is focusing its investigation on a Patriots locker room attendant.

Belichick answers questions during a press conference yesterday; while the Patriots escaped a winter blizzard to make their way to the Super Bowl city of Phoenix yesterday, there was no avoiding the storm of controversy that has swirled ever since they defeated the Colts

The attendant was reportedly caught shuttling balls from the official's locker room to another room in Gillette Stadium surveillance footage before they made it to the field.

League authorities are said to have interviewed the attendant at least twice as part of their continued investigation to determine why 11 of 12 balls were under-inflated during the Super Bowl securing match.

The revelation may not come as a surprise to anyone who heard Brady defending his team in a press conference last week.

He said: 'I have a process before every game where I take the footballs I want to use for the game. Our equipment guys do a great job breaking the balls in for the game. Our equipment guys have a process they go through.'

The Patriots escaped a winter blizzard to make their way to the Super Bowl city of Phoenix yesterday, but there was no avoiding the storm of controversy that has swirled ever since they defeated the Colts. Stepping off the plane the team were greeted by hundreds of media, who wanted to grill them further on 'Deflate-gate'.
