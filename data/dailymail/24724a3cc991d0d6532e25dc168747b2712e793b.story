Southampton, Peterborough and Newcastle are Britain's worst debt blackspots, figures released today show.

At the end of 2013, people living in and around Southampton were £1,880 in debt per person - the highest in the country.

Peterborough was the second hardest hit town in the UK - with people  owing £1,869. Newcastle sits third in the debt league, with personal debt levels of £1,550 per head.

Today's figures also show that of Britain's £902 billion-worth of  mortgage debt, around a quarter was held in London.

When the rest of the South East is included - almost half of all Britain's mortgage debt is held in thw wider area around the capital.

In Wales, the total amount of mortgage debt was just £28.6 billion at the end of last year - which comes to just under the combined home loan debts in  South West London alone - at £29.7 billion.

In Scotland, the total outstanding mortgage debt was £64.3 billion.

The mortgage and personal loan data has been provided by Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, Nationwide Building Society, Santander, RBS, and Clydesdale and Yorkshire Banks. 

Today's figures came after it was revealed that Britain’s household debt mountain had already hit a record high.

At the end of last year it had soared to £1.43trillion, the Bank of England revealed.

Personal debt has risen steadily since the financial crash, and is now higher than the previous record seen five years ago.

The Bank of England said personal debt has risen again to £1.43trillion, higher than the previous record seen in 2008

The increase is seen as a sign of increased consumer confidence, as the economic recovery gathers pace, but it could also mean more people relying on credit to make ends meet.

The amount of money owed by individuals in October last year stood at £1,4trillion the Bank said.

It is £29million higher than the previous high of £1,429,595,000,000 seen in September 2008, just before the financial crash hit.

But new figures show that £1.27trillion is now owed in mortgages and £158million in consumer credit.
