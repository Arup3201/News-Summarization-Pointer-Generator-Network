An opulent London home that was to be given an extravagant makeover by Italian designer Gianni Versace, who was murdered before he was able to move in, has been put up for sale for £15million.

Versace decided on the 18th century four-bedroom home in Charles Street in Mayfair while looking for a London base as he considered floating his fashion empire on the stock exchange in the 1990s. 

He ordered an overhaul of the inside of the expensive Grade II listed townhouse, which included plans to install a giant diamond patterned marble slab entrance hall and 30-foot high double doors - believed to be the largest of their type in a private home in London.

Gianni Versace ordered a radical makeover of a Mayfair mansion he planned to buy, but never got to complete the sale because he was murdered before he could move in. The opulent four bedroom grade II listed property has now gone on the market for £15million 

The house (blue door) was to be a London base for Versace who was considering floating his company on the stock market

But the designer never got to live in the palatial home because he was shot dead outside his Miami beach mansion in 1997 by Andrew Cunanan, a serial killer he had met in San Francisco whilst designing costumes for the opera. The purchase of the house was never completed. 

Following his death the ambitious conversion plans for the property were scaled down and it was quietly sold to a businessman later that year. 

However the house, which was owned by various members of the aristocracy and wealthy merchants before being converted into offices after World War Two, has retained some of its extravagant elements. 

A designer kitchen takes up almost the entire lower ground floor and leads into an atrium. While the second floor is dominated by a master bedroom suite which features a large double bedroom opening onto a private balcony, a walk-in dressing room and a large master bathroom with oversize oval bathtub.

A kitchen and dining room covers almost an entire floor of the London townhouse, and has been extensively modernised 

Wetherell estate agents, who are handling the sale, said the glass back of the mansion makes it particularly unique for prospective buyers

There are three further bedrooms and lifts to all floors, including extensive storage vaults on the lower ground floor.  

The first floor boasts a reception room with gold leaf ceiling coving along with a marble fireplace and a separate study. 

The Versace home that never was has now been put on the market with Wetherell estate agents for £15 million and also boasts a 34ft garden.

It covers 5,756 sq ft.

Peter Wetherell, chief executive of Wetherell, said: 'The Charles Street mansion is a striking fusion of highly traditional and contemporary, with a brick front and a glass back, and inside classic rooms and modern open plan spaces.

The 18th century property has four bedrooms and includes lifts to all its floors and was to be extensively redecorated by Versace 

The house has a grand sweeping spiral staircase, which links the lower floors to the four bedrooms above including the master suite 

The Grade II listed property was owned by various members of the aristocracy and the wealthy and was to be extensively redeveloped 

An oval oversize bath tub sits in the bathroom adjoining the master suite of the property, which covers almost an entire floor

'The patio garden flows into the glass conservatory, the largest of its kind in a private home in London's West End.

'It will appeal to a buyer who wants a statement home with space to entertain on a large scale

Versace, who died at the age of 50, owned property in Miami, Manhattan and Milan. 

Last year the Ocean Drive mansion where he was shot dead was reopened as a luxury boutique hotel. The mansion boasts a number of elements that may have been seen in the London home had he had the chance - including a 54-foot 'thousand mosaic' swimming pool lined in 24-carat gold. 

Cunanan, a 27-year-old ‘high-class’ gay prostitute, was said to be responsible for Versace's murder. After an international manhunt he was was found to have committed suicide in the upstairs bedroom of the Miami houseboat where he had been hiding out.
