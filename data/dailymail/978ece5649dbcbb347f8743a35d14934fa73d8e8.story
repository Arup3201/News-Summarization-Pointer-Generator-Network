Fit for internationals. That’s the verdict on the facilities at some of England’s famous rugby-playing schools for next year’s Rugby World Cup finals.

Schools around England will be hosting international teams next autumn as part of the third biggest sports event in the world after the Olympics and football’s World Cup.

They are all being used as training bases after emerging successful from a bidding process which saw organisers draw up a shortlist of 100 proposed centres around the country.

Organisers are hoping each centre will promote ‘adopt a team’ initiatives which proved successful at the last World Cup in New Zealand where home fans supported not just the All Blacks.

Each team base had to offer an outdoor and indoor training facility, a pool, gym and hotel within close proximity.

With the competition being staged mostly during next year’s autumn term pupils will have an opportunity to see the world best players at close quarters.

‘It will be a fabulous chance to see how they train and prepare,’ Sam Howard, the director of rugby at Dulwich College, who will be hosting Australia.

At nearby Trinity School, in Croydon, south London, France have been promised a warm welcome.

Director of Rugby, Aaron Liffchak said: ’The whole school is excited at the thought of hosting the French rugby team.

‘To be recognised as one of the top rugby facilities in the country is a huge compliment to the many staff that work so hard to create such a special environment. It is really great to be bringing the “Tricolores” to Croydon.’

Besides Dulwich and Croydon, other schools involved are Moulton College (Northampton), Warwick School, Brighton College, Haileybury School, Leicester Grammar School and Bicton College (Devon).

Bernard Lapasset, the IRB chairman, said: ‘Rugby World Cup 2015 will be an event that has players and fans at heart, and I am delighted that the teams participating at England 2015 will have access to exceptional facilities the length and breadth of the host nation.’
