A teenager sent a boastful text message to a girlfriend moments after stabbing a former friend to death.

Moments after killing Michael Graham, 19, Macauley Jenkinson, 16, sent a text message that said 'Stabbed Angel [Michael's nickname] 12 times. Love you loads. Kiss. Kiss. Kiss'.

Jenkinson had previously told the girlfriend, who was 14, that he and Mr Graham were heading for a showdown after falling out because Mr Graham had mocked him about her age.

Teesside Crown Court was told that the attack was carried out with such stealth that people nearby did not initially realise that Mr Graham had been stabbed.

Jenkinson was today sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 16 years following the fight outside an arcade in Scarborough, North Yorkshire.

Details of the tragedy emerged as an order on identifying Jenkinson was lifted after he was convicted of murder and wounding following a trial.

Mr Graham was targeted in the street by a 'hate club' of youngsters who had a mutual dislike of him.

Mr Graham had previously been friends with Jenkinson, but when Jenkinson started a relationship with a 14-year-old girl, they fell out.

Sentencing him, Judge Simon Bourne-Arton QC described Jenkinson as a 'coward'.

Mr Graham began mocking Jenkinson about the age gap and the younger man was so enraged by the taunts he bought a flick knife and warned a girlfriend he was ‘heading for a showdown with him’. 

Tim Roberts QC, prosecuting said: ‘He said he was prepared to stab him and that Michael Graham deserved to die.’

The violence erupted outside Olympia arcade in Scarborough at around 11.30pm on April 13 this year after Mr Graham and another teenager, aged 17, were surrounded by Jenkinson and seven of his friends.

One of the group began to attack him but as the victim fought back, Jenkinson intervened and stabbed him in the back. Mr Graham tried to place his attacker in a head lock then collapsed as the gang fled.

It emerged the attack was so ferocious, Jenkinson accidentally cut himself as he pushed the handle so hard into the victim’s body that his hand slipped onto the blade.

Mr Roberts added: ‘The blows were inflicted with such rapidity and stealth that it was not obvious to onlookers that a weapon was being used at all.

‘It is a measure of the calculation with which this crime was committed that the defendant seems actually to have counted in his head each thrust of the knife at the time because afterwards he was to text several friends with the information that he had stabbed Angel 12 times.’

Judge Simon Bourne-Arton QC told him: ‘Michael Graham described you as a coward and a coward is what you are in fact.

‘You waited until he was defenceless before carrying out that attack on him. You stabbed him with ferocity.

‘You were glad when you announced to your friends that he deserved to die. You showed not one jot of sadness or regret. You are a dangerous young man.’

Detective Chief Inspector Maria Taylor, of North Yorkshire Police said after the case: ‘This is an extremely tragic case which has left a young man dead and another young man facing up to a considerable length of time in prison.

‘Michael had his whole life in front of him and to be murdered in this brutal and senseless manner has left his family and friends devastated. 

‘Macauley Jenkinson attacked Michael in such and aggressive and violent manner that there is little doubt that he intended to do him serious harm on the night that he killed him. 

‘Stabbing him in the back gave Michael no chance of defending himself and Jenkinson has to live with the fact that his cowardly attack has robbed a family of one of their loved ones.’

In a statement Mr Graham’s family said: ‘Our lives have been shattered. Not only have we lost a son, grandson, brother, nephew and a dad, we have also lost a friend who loved his family and was always there for us when we needed him, no matter what. 

‘He was a good friend to many and we would especially like to thank one of his best friends who was with him at the end. It is a great comfort for us to know that Mickey was with such a close friend.’
