The highest court in 
Massachusetts rejected the appeal of a British man convicted of killing 
his wife and baby daughter in their rented home, saying in its decision 
released today that warrantless searches of the home were justified 
because those inside might have been in danger.

In
 arguing for a new trial, lawyers for Neil Entwistle said saying 
evidence obtained during the warrantless searches of the Hopkinton home 
while police were looking for the missing family should have been 
dismissed. They also argued that media coverage made it 
impossible to get an impartial jury

The court rejected the arguments, concluding that Entwistle 'received a fair trial that was ably tried and judged.'

Loses appeal: A file photograph showing convicted murderer Neil Entwistle being led into court to listen to impact statements and be read his sentence at Middlesex Superior Court in Woburn, Massachusetts, USA, 26 June 2008

Entwistle was convicted of the 2006 shootings of his wife, Rachel, and their nine-month-old daughter, Lillian.

The Nottingham engineer is serving life in prison without the possibility of parole for their murders.

The
 Entwistles met as students at the University of York in England in 
1999, while Rachel was in a study abroad program. Both were on the 
university's crew team.

The two married in 
England in 2003 after she graduated from College of the Holy Cross in 
Massachusetts and returned to the United Kingdom to earn a teaching 
certificate and be with her husband.

Months after their daughter's birth, the couple came to Massachusetts to live. At first, they lived with Rachel's parents.

The
 couple rented their own four-bedroom home in January 2006, but Neil 
Entwistle was unable to find a job. Prosecutors argued at trial that he 
killed his wife and daughter because he was upset about his failure to 
find employment.

Entwistle, who is serving a life sentence in the US for shooting his wife and baby daughter dead, has lost an appeal against his conviction, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court said today

Convicted: Neil Entwistle is escorted out of Framingham District Court following his arraignment in Framingham, Massachusetts February 16, 2006

Entwistleâ€™s trial heard how he was 
heavily in debt and lying to his wife about his job 
prospects while secretly looking for extra-marital sex on the internet.

Rachel 
Entwistle's parents and the couple's friends had expressed concerns that
 she and her daughter were missing for days, and police found them dead 
in the home's master bedroom on Jan. 22, 2006, while doing a second 
search of the home.

His lawyer, Stephen Maidman, said police should have obtained a search warrant before entering the house a second time.

Neil Entwistle took a 
one-way flight from Boston to London on Jan. 21, later telling police he
 found his wife and baby dead on January 20 after returning from shopping, 
but didn't call for help.

He claimed he panicked after finding 
the bodies and flew to Britain without alerting the police because he 
wanted to be with his parents.
