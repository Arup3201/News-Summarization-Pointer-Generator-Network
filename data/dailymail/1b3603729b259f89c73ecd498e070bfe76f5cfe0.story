Jeff Bezos' estranged biological father has revealed that he plans to contact the billionaire amazon founder after learning about their genetic connection last year - nearly half a century after abandoning the boy and divorcing his mother when they were teenagers.

Bezos, 49, was born to teenage parents in Albuquerque, New Mexico and his mother left his birth father after being married for two years.

As told in a book excerpt published in Bloomberg Businessweek, writer Brad Stone reveals that he was the one to actually tell Bezos' father that the son he abandoned as an infant was the multi-billionaire who runs one of the biggest companies in America.

Then and now: Ted Jorgensen was a teenage unicyclist (left) when his son Jeffrey was born, and he only learned that the boy grew up to be Jeff Bezos last year (pictured right this year, at age 69)

Ted Jorgensen was an 18-year-old unicyclist who was a rising star on the niche circuit when his girlfriend, Jackie Gise, became pregnant.

The pair travelled to New Mexico to get married- because she was too young under American law- and then returned and had a makeshift ceremony at her house where both of their mothers signed their marriage application form.

Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen was born on January 12, 1964, and 17 months later, Ted and Jackie got a divorce. Both Jackie and her father told Ted never to contact the family again, and he agreed.

The lengthy book excerpt tells how she then started dating her co-worker, Mike Bezos, who she eventually married.

She asked Jorgensen's legal permission to allow her new husband to adopt their son, Jeffrey, and he agreed.

Fast forward 47 years and little Jeffrey Bezos is all grown up, having turned his book shipping business into an online behemoth that turns over around $75billion in annual revenue.

Reporter Brad Stone went to the small bike repair shop in Glendale, Arizona that Jorgensen owns in 2012, and he found the 69-year-old working behind the counter.

'I’d considered a number of ways he might react to my unannounced appearance but gave a very low probability to the likelihood of what actually happened: He had no idea what I was talking about,' Stone writes.

'Jorgensen said he didn’t know who Jeff Bezos was and was baffled by my suggestion that he was the father of this famous CEO.'

It was only after the author brought up Jeff's mother Jackie Gise and their infant son Jeffrey that he saw the wheels in Jorgensen's head begin to turn before seeing his eyes fill 'with sorrow and disbelief'.

His own family: Bezos married his wife MacKenzie in 1993 (seen together at the Met Ball in 2012) and they have four children

Stone then met with Jorgensen and his current wife Linda who has four children that he helped raise.

'I wasn’t a good father or a husband,' Jorgensen said of his first marriage.

'It was really all my fault. I don’t blame Jackie at all.'

At
 first, the couple decided that they would not tell her four sons about 
their half sibling, but early this year they changed their mind.

The
 Bloomberg article tells how the youngest of the sons, Darin Fala, 
reached back out to Stone and told him that he and his stepfather had 
decided to reach out to Bezos.

'My wife calls me unemotional because she has never seen me cry,' Fala said after the big reveal.

'Ted
 is the same way. Saturday was the most emotion I’ve ever seen out of 
him, as far as sadness and regret. It was overwhelming.'
