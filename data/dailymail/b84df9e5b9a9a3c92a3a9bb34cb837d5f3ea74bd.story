Both Aaron Hernandez's mother and the mother of his alleged murder victim broke down in tears during a court hearing this afternoon.

The former Patriots player is charged with the murder of Odin Lloyd and he appeared in a Falls River, Massachusetts court on Monday because his defense team says that the district attorney is jeopardizing his right to a fair trial.

While the attorneys battled over the substance of leaks and public statements in the case, the emotional drama was taking place behind the barricade as Hernandez mouthed 'I love you' to his mother in the audience.

Grinner: Hernandez seemed in a good mood, 
flashing a smile to his attorney which caused his alleged victim's 
mother to break into tears

Making his case: The former NFL star's attorneys were arguing that a gag order should be put in place to avoid the future jury in his murder case from being tainted against him

His team: Hernandez was supported in court by his mother Terri (right) and fiancee Shayanna Jenkins (left). Ms Jenkin's sister was dating the man Hernandez is accused of murdering

Causing pain: Hernandez's jovial attitude caused the mother of Odin Lloyd to break down in tears and briefly leave the courtroom to compose herself

She was sitting next to Hernandez's fiancÃ©e Shayanna Jenkins, who is accused of lying to a grand jury 29 times and is charged with perjury in the case against Hernandez.

Victim: Odin Lloyd, 27, was found shot to death 'execution style' just miles from Hernandez's home

Hernandez turned around and smiled at the supportive women but those emotional sentiments sent another woman into a tailspin as Odin Lloyd's mother broke down in tears and had to leave the courtroom briefly to compose herself.

Hernandez is accused of killing Lloyd, a 27-year-old semi-professional football player who was dating Ms Jenkin's sister.

The defense attorneys argued that the prosecution has been making prejudicial public statements against the accused murderer which could hinder the impartiality of the jury, according to Associated Press reporter Erika Niedowski who was in the courtroom.  

They said that the 24-year-old 
football player should be able to have a jury 'that has not been 
poisoned by either false or sensational statements' though the district 
attorneys deny any wrong doing.

'Everytime...law
 enforcement officials leak to the media, the ability of Hernandez to 
receive a fair trial is eroded,' a member of Hernandez's defense team 
said, according to Boston Globe reporter Wesley Lowery who was in the 
courtroom.

The prosecution 
defended their tactics but did not explain why they had not released any
 DNA evidence to the football player's attorneys.

Charged: A grand jury indicted Shayanna Jenkins, 24, on a single count in relation to the investigation into the June 17 killing of Odin Lloyd, who was shot dead near Hernandez's home (pictured at an earlier hearing)

'They're suggestion that we have moles out there leaking information is untrue... We're playing fair,' prosecutor Bill McCauley said.

'We are playing fair,' prosecutor Bill McCauley said, according to Associated Press reporter Erika Niedowski who was in the courtroom.

The defense attorneys were seeking a gag order for the case leading up to the yet-unscheduled trial, and many legal speculators believe it is a likely outcome.

The final verdict was not handed down on Monday but the defense has until January 8 to submit a new proposal to the court. The District Attorney's office has until the following week to respond.
