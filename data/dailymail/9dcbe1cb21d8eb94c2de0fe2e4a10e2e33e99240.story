Barcelona star Lionel Messi surprised a fan from his hometown of Rosario on social media with a pair of his latest Adidas boots. 

The Argentina international took to Twitter and Facebook and wrote a personal message to Brian Rossi, the lucky fan who grew up in the same city as Messi, to surprise him with the boots.

Alongside a picture where Messi is seen holding the boots, he wrote on Facebook: 'I am a Pibe De Barrio, the boy from the neighbourhood, and now I have these boots for Brian Rossi who is also from Rosario. #PibeDeBarr10 #therewillbehaters'.

Messi has been in exceptional form in recent weeks, helping Barcelona overcome Manchester City in the Champions League with an impressive solo performance before seeing his side defeat rivals Real Madrid in the El Clasico on Sunday. 

With the spotlight firmly on Messi when he's on the pitch, the 27-year-old will no doubt earn rave reviews off it with this surprise gift. 

Rossi, the lucky fan, will be licking his lips at the prospect of wearing Messi's boots and will hope he plays like him too.
