Duck Dynasty is an American reality television series which shows the lives of the Robertson family, who became wealthy from their family-operated business, Duck Commander, operated in West Monroe, Louisiana.

The company makes products for duck hunters, primarily the duck call named Duck Commander.

The Robertson men, brothers Phil, Si, and Phil's sons Jase, Willie, and Jep, are known for their long beards.Â 

This year's biggest baby name trends were inspired by the record-breaking reality show, according to BabyCenter's annual survey.

Of the key characters appearing on the hit A&E series, the name Korie increased by 89 per cent and Mia was up 44 per cent while Phil, Sadie and Silas were up 32, 23 and 15 per cent, respectively.

New parents apparently looked to the Louisiana-based camouflage-loving crew because of their down-to-earth, humorous and religious personalities.
