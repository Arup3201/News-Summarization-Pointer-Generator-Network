Staring straight ahead, many with their right arm casually balanced on the back of a chair, these Victorian adults look lost deep in thought.

What their demure expressions fail to reveal, however, is that they are all posing for their police mugshot.

Although each is an offender apprehended in Newcastle in the 1870s, in only a couple of photos is it possible to detect any inkling of remorse.

Instead, their bewildered faces reflect a time when photography was a relatively new technology and posing for a picture a rarity.

Jailed: Labourer William Brankston (left), 43, from Alnwick, Northumberland, served a one-month sentence after he was convicted of stealing four rabbits, while blacksmith William Bell (right), 32, was sent to Newcastle Gaol for stealing beef

Criminal records: John Grieveson (left), 21, was sentenced to four months in Newcastle Gaol for stealing pigeons. Charles Burns (right), 19, a miner from Liverpool, was jailed for three months after being convicted of false pretenses

Punished: Mary Patterson (left), 25, was jailed for six weeks for stealing poultry in 1873, and Mary Ann Ross (right), 34, worked as a prostitute and was convicted of stealing money on numerous occasions. She was sentenced to six months in Newcastle Gaol following this mugshot

The fascinating images, which mostly 
feature petty thieves who stole everything from rabbits to champagne, 
have been released today 
by Tyne and Wear Archives and Museums.

The criminality detailed in the 
charges may be the same as in contemporary Britain, but the mixture of 
scruffy clothing and more formal Victorian street attire worn in the 
mugshots clearly defines an era of mass poverty.

Shipbuilding and heavy engineering 
were Newcastle’s main industries in the 19th century and the city was a 
powerhouse of the Industrial Revolution.

But while the latter had made 
Britain rich, it also led to grinding poverty in cramped inner-city 
slums plagued by hunger and disease.

Liz Rees, Head of Archives and Collections at Tyne and Wear Archives and Museums, said: ‘Newcastle expanded 
enormously from the 1850s onwards and as the population increased, 
living conditions for most were poor.

'It was a boom town with people 
coming in from the countryside, Ireland and Scotland looking for work, 
but there weren’t always enough jobs to go around.'

Caught: John Roman (left), was a 64-year-old tailor from Germany who was sentenced to 14 days of hard labour for stealing clothes in 1873. Ezekiel Yates (right), 35, was a grocer from Penrith who received a six-month sentence for stealing tobacco

Thieves: Newcastle street trader Mary Ann McCasfrey (left), 41, was given a four-month sentence for stealing a gold watch, while Irish labourer Edward Shevlin (right), 32, was jailed for six months for stealing a coat

Imprisoned: Catherine Flynn (left), 34, was sentenced to six months at Newcastle Gaol for stealing money from another person, and Jane Carlisle (right), 29, served two months at the same jail after a conviction for stealing bed linen

As today, metal thefts were on the rise, due to the booming shipbuilding business in Newcastle at the time.

Ms Rees said: ‘It was mostly opportunism
with metal hanging around, but obviously it had a resale value. There’s
still a lot of metal theft going on around here today.’

The widespread poverty led to parents
educating their children in the skills of street survival, condemning a
further generation to a life of crime.

Nigel Green, historian and author of 
Tough Times, turned up police records which show that in the years from 
1838 to 1851 the number of minors arrested for petty crimes more than 
doubled.

Some of the children picked up by the
police were as young as eight, and they were often held in stinking 
prison cells alongside adults.

These pictures of adult offenders, as
well as those of their juvenile counterparts, make up just some of Tyne
and Wear Archives and Museums’ collection, which are being put online.

Thomas Smith (left), 32, was jailed for three months after he and two accomplices defrauded a gentlemen in 1873. James Richley (right), 30, was served seven days of hard labour at Newcastle Gaol for stealing trivets, used as supports for kettles

Robert Hardy (left), 21, served four months at Newcastle Gaol for stealing ale with two accomplices in 1873, while labourer Robert Bolam (right), 20, from Gateshead was found guilty of stealing clothes and sentenced to six months. He also had two accomplices who also received six-month sentences

Cabinet maker David Barron (left), 19, was sentenced to six months in prison for stealing champagne. Alice Mullholland (right), 18, was a street trader from Newcastle who was sentenced to three months in Newcastle Gaol for stealing boots

Agnes Stewart (left), 28, was a married woman from Edinburgh was jailed for stealing money, and William Harrison (right), a 51-year-old porter from Durham, was sentenced to 12 months in Newcastle Gaol in 1872 after he was convicted of obtaining oats by false pretense
