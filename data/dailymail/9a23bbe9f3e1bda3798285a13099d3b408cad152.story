An Alabama judge has dismissed a second lawsuit filed by a man who says his penis was amputated during a circumcision gone awry. 

Circuit Judge Jim Hughey in Birmingham issued an order Wednesday throwing out the lawsuit filed by Johnny Lee Banks Jr, 56, and his wife against Princeton Baptist Medical Center and doctors he claims injured him.

It is the second lawsuit Banks has filed in the incident. Judge Hughey tossed Banks' original lawsuit in August. Hughey ruled it was not specific enough under Alabama's malpractice law.

Hughey's ruling on the second lawsuit cites similar reasons. But he left the door open for a third lawsuit.

Banks, a wheelchair-bound double amputee and a diabetic, says he awoke from what should have been a routine circumcision to realize that his sex organ had been chopped down to about an inch. 

The hospital and doctors have denied any wrongdoing. Court documents show Banks has numerous health problems.

Michael Florie, an attorney representing the doctors named in Banks' now-defunct lawsuit, has dismissed the allegations as 'completely false.'

In August, Florie said Banks had a history of 'diabetic wet gangrene,' which led to dead tissue accumulation in the patient's lower extremities, according to AL.com.

At the time of the first lawsuit's dismissal two months ago, Banks' attorney said the physical evidence in the case should be sufficient. 

The 'proof is in the pudding,' he told AL.com. 

Banks' wife Zelda, 55, also sued for loss of consortium due to the bungled operation. 

In the amended lawsuit filed in September, Banks' attorney, John Graves, changed the date of the procedure from June to February 2014, and also named Dr Meil Duggan Jr as the surgeon who 'may have performed the circumcision,' the local TV station Alabama's 13 reported. 

According to the patient and his attorney, the penis amputation was performed without consent or explanation of the operation's medical necessity.

In response, the lawyer representing the doctors in the case accused his counterpart of ignoring the medical records.

'In the complaint filed last month, this patient claimed that he awoke to find his penis missing in June,' Michael Florie said in September. 'Now he alleges that he awoke to find it missing in February.'
