Australia’s national day may have been shadowed by grey skies and rain across some of the country’s biggest cities but that wasn’t the only fail on the day of celebration.

From a New Zealand flag accidentally hung on the ceiling in a Woolies store to the bowls club who announced Australia Day was ‘postponed due to Pommie weather,’ people have been posting the funniest things they spotted across the country on social media.

Shunning the pub and cold beers for their backyard and a sack of goon, one group of friends stood around their Hills Hoist and partook in a game of ‘goon of fortune’.

Explaining the drinking game on photo sharing site Imgur, one commenter wrote: ‘Strap a goon (wine) sack onto the spinning clothes line. Spin. Whoever it lands on sculls from the sack for a predetermined amount of time.’

One fan of the photo added: ‘I also like how during the drinking game you also have a beer while you're waiting for your turn.’

His friend Dylan Roberts, 21, told the Herald Sun that police warned them to stop and then later more officers arrived at a house party they were at with ‘pepper spray’.
