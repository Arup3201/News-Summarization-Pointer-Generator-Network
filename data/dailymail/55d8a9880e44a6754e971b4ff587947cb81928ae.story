Mario Balotelli would need only seven goals per season for Liverpool to see the financial benefit of his £16million recruitment from AC Milan. 

Whether or not the statistical boffins at John W Henry’s Fenway Sports Group have made such calculations remains unknown but FSG have famously applied ‘Moneyball’ techniques to player recruitment at Anfield in the past and there is sure to have been some economic reckoning around Balotelli.

The mathematics that say he needs seven goals per season to repay the investment in him is simple enough, and is based on him being given a three-year contract on wages of around £5million per year.

Done deal? Mario Balotelli is expected to complete a £16million move to Liverpool this summer

Target: Balotelli would need to score seven Premier League goals a season to payback his £31million outlay

Liverpool have already agreed in principle a £16m transfer fee for the 24-year-old forward, who is capable of lighting up the pitch every bit as lighting up his bathroom with a fireworks-related house fire.

A three-year deal at £5m wages per year plus a £16m fee would mean a £31m outlay by Liverpool for the contract and wages.

How do goals repay that?

Roughly speaking, each goal in the Premier League is worth one point, on average. In fact, it’s not so roughly speaking at all; there is an extremely close relationship between goals scored and points won, across the division as a whole.

Last season, for example, there were 1,052 goals scored in the Premier League, and the 20 clubs combined won 1,062 points. Each goal, essentially, on average, is worth a point.

The amount of points a club wins directly affect where they finish in the league, and hence also affect the amount of prize money they win from the Premier League.

Predator: Balotelli has scored 26 goals in 43 Milan league games since joining the club in January last year

To simplify, more goals equals more points equals more prize money.

The total amount of Premier League prize money split between the 20 clubs last season was £1.563billion, which equates to £1,485,741 per goal, or £1.5m per goal, give or take.

An outlay of £31m on Mario Balotelli over three seasons would therefore require 20.66 goals over three years at £1.5m each to cover the cost of hiring him. That’s seven per season, in the Premier League.

Any goals he scored in any other competition would be a bonus. Any fee he attracted should he be sold later would be a bonus. Any income Liverpool accrue from selling Balotelli shirts or merchandise would be a bonus.

Of course there is the possibility that Balotelli will arrive on Merseyside and fail to fire. If he scored fewer than his seven goals per year he would arguably be an economic flop. But he has scored 26 goals in 43 Milan league games since joining in January last year, and 20 in 54 Premier League games for Manchester City before that.

Problematic though he may be, it’s likely that an American economist somewhere in FSG has looked at the numbers and realised Balotelli is worth the punt, financially as well as in a sporting sense.
