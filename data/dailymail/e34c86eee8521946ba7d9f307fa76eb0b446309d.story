Baby Cambridge has inspired erotic fiction publishers Mills & Boon to branch out into romance stories about sordid affairs and scandalous pregnancies

From mugs to baby onesies, the birth of the royal baby has caused a boom in novelty memorabilia.

The latest company to jump on the royal baby bandwagon is erotic fiction company Mills & Boon who have launched a collection of three short romance stories inspired by Kate and William's newborn.

Baby Cambridge has inspired them to branch out into romance stories about sordid affairs and scandalous pregnancies.

The first book is about protagonist Sienna 
Wainwright and a one night stand she indulges in with lothario Rafe 
Lombardi- who is later revealed as the Prince of Montvelatte.

While another book charts the life of a character called Cally Greenway who's hoping to secure a job restoring
some valuable paintings, until they are sold to the Prince of Montez.

Cally then gets a royal summons – as the mistress of the Prince.

'Let us 
treat you like a queen - relax and enjoy three glamorous, passionate 
stories about privileged royal life, love affairs...and scandalous 
pregnancies!' says the £6.99 tome.

The decision to create bodice-rippers around the birth of an heir to the throne has, unsurprisingly, raised a few eyebrows.

In
a round-up of the top five worst Royal baby tie-ins, The Huffington Post 
wrote: 'The crowning glory is Mills & Boon's new special release, 
titled - wait for it - Royal Baby, with the dizzying tagline "The prince
demands an heir...and what he wants, he gets!"

'It's
worth reading the blurb in full (if you enjoy stabbing your brain with a
pencil), but suffice to say this probably isn't sitting on The Queen's 
bedside table.'

From mugs to baby onesies, this is just one of the crazy pieces of royal baby memorabilia inspired by Kate and William's newborn

Mills & Boon was founded in 1908 by Gerald Rusgrove Mills and Charles Boon as a general publisher and moved towards escapist fiction for women in the 1930s.

The books have been widely criticised for being low-brow and formulaic, and have even been condemned as misogynistic rape fantasies.

Over one hundred new novels are released each month and vary in explicitness, setting and style with many fans citing predictability and repetition as a key reason for reading them.
