Damien Baxendale was jailed for 10 years after he left his girlfriend so badly injured doctors said it was like she had been in a 'serious car crash'

A vicious thug punched and kicked his girlfriend so hard doctors said it was like she had been in a car crash after she suffered a bleed on the brain, a fractured vertebrae and a fractured eye socket.

Damien Baxendale was jailed for 10 years after he left 23-year-old Chelsea Hayes unconscious, her clothing torn and blood splattered around the rooms at his flat in Bolton, Greater Manchester.

She was so badly swollen her three-year-old daughter, Shernia, did not recognise her and she now suffers from back pain, headaches, nausea, dizziness, poor memory and depression. 

Rachel White, prosecuting, told Bolton Crown Court that a neighbour saw the 24-year-old outside his flat at 3am on August 3 last year, kicking someone in the face 'as if he was kicking a football'. 

When police officers arrived, Baxendale refused to let them in, claiming Miss Hayes was asleep, but relented when they threatened to force their way in.

Miss White told the court: 'Inside was covered with blood all over and it looked as if a struggle had taken place.

'Chelsea Hayes was severely injured, gagging and unconscious.'

Baxendale claimed Miss Hayes had been drunk telling police it was 'all her own fault' and claiming she had banged her head.

While his girlfriend lay unconscious in hospital Baxendale told officers: 'When she wakes up she will verify everything I have said.'

The court heard Miss Hayes spent 10 days in hospital and could not remember anything about that night.

Miss Hayes had to have a metal plate installed in her cheek bone to reconstruct her face and surgeons went in via her eye socket, which is now scarred (pictured)

Miss White said: 'It is the kind of injury usually seen in road traffic collisions.'

He left her with a bleed on the brain, two fractured vertebrae, a fractured eye socket which had to be reconstructed, damaged neck ligaments, black eyes and lips so swollen she could not open her mouth. 

The court heard Baxendale was granted bail in February this year but almost exactly a year later, on August 2 he was arrested again after a violent street attack on another girlfriend.

At 5am a resident called police after seeing Baxendale kick the woman in the side and repeatedly punch her in the face. Her injuries included a fractured nose and bruised and swollen face.

Baxendale, of Bolton, Greater Manchester, pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm with intent and causing grievous bodily harm.

Colin Buckle, defending, said his client 'knows he does not deserve the clemency of the court'.

Baxendale was jailed for ten years, with a further four on licence for the attack and second violent assault.

Judge Peter Davies said: 'They were savage, brutal, ferocious and frenzied assaults.'

He told him that he regarded him as a dangerous offender who posed a serious risk to the public and he did not accept he was remorseful.

Members of Miss Hayes' family cheered and applauded as Baxendale was sentenced.
