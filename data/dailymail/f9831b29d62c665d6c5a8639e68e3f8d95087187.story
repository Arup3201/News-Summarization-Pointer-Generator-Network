The 84-year-old grandson of a legendary Texas oil tycoon was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head in his mansion Friday.

Roy Henry Cullen, whose grandfather was Hugh Roy Cullen, was the longtime president of Houston's most prominent charitable organizations the Cullen Foundation.

He served in the role until stepping down just this year.

Shocking: Prominent Houston philanthropist and oil scion Roy Henry Cullen was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head on Friday

Sad: Police responded to a welfare call early Friday and found Cullen's bedroom door locked. They forced their way inside and found his body

According to the Houston Chronicle, police were called to make a welfare check at the Cullens' mansion early Friday.

They broke in to his locked bedroom to find him dead.

Family: Cullen, who learned both the oil business and the business of giving from his legendary grandfather, is survived by his four children and his wife Mary

'His body was found lying on the floor with a bullet wound to the head. A revolver was spotted nearby,' Houston police spokesman John Cannon told the Chronicle.

The family has not commented on the death.

While by many accounts Cullen, who was born October 29, 1929, enjoyed joking that he was born the day of the stock market crash that started the Great Depression, he inherited his grandfather's business acumen.

He was a longtime director of Quintana Petroleum Company, a business he learned from his grandfather, and an original board member of Cullen Bank.

His financial successes, which also extended into the real estate market, translated into big gains for Texas charities.

Cullen's foundation issued over $15 million in grants during the philanthropist's last year as president.

The
 organization gave money for causes ranging from health care to cultural
 programs and ranked fifth among charitable Houston organizations for 
grants awarded.

The organization was created by Cullen's grandparents in 1947 and at the time its $160 million endowment was one of America's largest ever.

Cullen 
became especially interested in giving to Parkinson's research after his
 daughter Lillie died from the disease after being diagnosed at the age 
of 53.

He is survived by his four other children Roy, Robert, Meredith and Melinda Cullen as well as by his wife Mary.
