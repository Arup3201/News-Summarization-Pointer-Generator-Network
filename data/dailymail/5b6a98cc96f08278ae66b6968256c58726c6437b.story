They say there's nothing quite like a bit of fresh air to clear your head and what better way to experience the great Australian outdoors than to embark on some of the most breathtaking hiking trails in the country.

With the rise of adventure films being released, such as Wild and Tracks, travellers' adventurous sides have come out and walking and hiking tour bookings have increased by 35 per cent in the past year.

With this is mind, Experience Oz has released their ultimate list of hiking spotlights for 2015 for veteran walkers and beginners alike, with Tasmania, WA, SA, NSW and Victoria all making the cut. 

1: Widely considered one of the world's best bushwalks, Tasmania's Overland Track comes in at number one on the list. The stunning location features an environment reminiscent of Switzerland and New Zealand and is roughly 65km long

The list, which is based purely on bookings received over the past 12 months, wasn't a big surprise for the  team, as Australia's most popular spots continue to claim their top positions.

Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Experience Oz Digital Marketing Manager Matt Hobbs said a growing number of Australians are taking up hiking or walking to experience the 'diversity' of the country. 

'One of the things we always hear about - especially from people who've been on multiple of hikes - is that they just appreciate the diversity,' Mr Hobbs said. 

'I guess it's one of the benefits of Australia being such a massive country that if you go on a track from one region to the other you come across a completely different landscape.'

Mr Hobbs said the vast landscape of Australia means that enthusiasts can go on a desert walk one week and be trekking through snow a couple of months later.

2:Recommended by Matt Hobbs, NSW phenomenon the Blue Mountains take its place at number two on the list. Its close proximity to Sydney makes it a convenient pit stop for hikers looking for a bit of nature near the big cityThe Blue Mountains feature massive waterfalls, rugged peaks and endless opportunities for exploration both on peak and in canyon

Tasmania features twice on the list with the Overland Track and The Bay of Fires Lodge Walk coming in first and third place respectively. Mr Hobbs puts this down to the 'alpine or European environment' of the state's walking tracks.

'Tasmania has always been one of the most popular areas for walking and hiking,' he said. 

'I think Tasmania is popular just because the scenery is different to mainland Australia and it allows Aussies to experience that alpine or European environment without leaving the country, so that's always been a strong state.'

Mr Hobbs said he would advise hikers to do as much research as possible before they embark on a walking holiday, as this type of holiday can be quit draining. 

'There are companies that cater for beginners, but if you are a beginner maybe opt for a package that is taken by a guided tour operator just because they know the lay of the land. They can pace the day's journey out evenly so you're not overextending yourself to get from one camp-site to the next,' he said. 

3:Tasmania makes its second appearance on the list as the Bay of Fires Lodge walk comes in at number three. Named after its characteristic lodge - the only building on the 20km walk - the Bay of Fires Lodge walk is a four day hiking journey.It's Ideal for those wanting a scenic getaway yet still looking to retain a hint of luxury with modern accommodation. White sand beaches separated by ridges offer scenic outlooks with blue waters, and a myriad of bird and animal life

'Australia is beautiful but it can also be quite dangerous if you're out in the middle of nowhere.'

For those travellers who prefer life's simple luxuries, you needn't worry as tour companies are also offering an eco-luxury hiking holiday where you will be provided with a lot of benefits along the way so you're not completely ruffing it. 

Widely considered one of the world's best bushwalks, Tasmania's Overland Track comes in at number one on the list.  The stunning location features an environment reminiscent of  Switzerland and New Zealand and is roughly 65km long.

The six day journey provides walkers with all the best hallmarks of alpine scenery – mountain streams, waterfalls and meadows making for a breathtaking spectacle. It also features the option to stay in a series of high-grade huts for accommodation.

4:The Twelve Apostles in Victoria are not only one of the most photographed location in Australia, but they are also the perfect breeding ground for avid hikers as it comes in at number four on the list

The mountain area – part of the Great Dividing Range which was given World Heritage status back in 2000 - is a true 'region' in itself for walkers and hikers. The Blue Mountains boast over 140 kilometres worth of trails and tracks of varying degrees of difficulty, rather than one single walk.

Tasmania makes its second appearance on the list as the Bay of Fires Lodge walk comes in at number three. Named after its characteristic lodge - the only building on the 20km walk - the Bay of Fires Lodge walk is a four day hiking journey.

The scenic walk is Australia's longest coastal walk running alongside the Indian Ocean from Cape Naturaliste in the north to Cape Leeuwin in the south.Unique rock formations, cliffs, limestone caves and the Karri forest make for a diverse journey for hiking enthusiasts

The Great Ocean Road  offers up a plethora of coastal scenery leading to the iconic 12 Apostles rock formations. The rocky cliff faces and open stretches of beaches are one of the country's essential walks for hiking enthusiasts that's suitable for walkers of any ability level.

Spread out over the course of just 100km, the track combines some of Australia's tallest coastal cliffs with the remnants of various shipwrecks and cliff top walks. and more. Different treks meander away from the coastline in several sections including into Otway National Park.

WA's breathtaking Cape to Cape trek makes in onto the list at number five. The scenic walk is Australia's longest coastal walk running alongside the Indian Ocean from Cape Naturaliste in the north to Cape Leeuwin in the south. 

Unique rock formations,  cliffs, limestone caves and the Karri forest make for a diverse journey for hiking enthusiasts. While there are plenty of smaller and easier segments of the Cape to Cape track that can be done separately, the full-length adventure involves roughly 20 – 25 kilometres worth of walking per day. This including a reasonable degree of soft-sand walking and a high level of accessibility.

Flinders Ranges in South Australia rounds of the list, coming in sixth place. The rugged walk is a four day overall trek and is broken up into separate walks of around seven hours per day covering anywhere between 6 to 15 kilometres in one section.
