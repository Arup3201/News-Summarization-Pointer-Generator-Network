His Oscar nomination for best actor had been announced only a few hours before, but Eddie Redmayne was already a winner – in the eyes of the glamorous women surrounding him.

From a gushing Angelina Jolie to a fawning Jessica Chastain, star of Interstellar, and a complimentary Emily Blunt, 31, the British actor was the only guest anyone wanted to talk to at a star-packed Hollywood event.

An animated Miss Jolie, 39, was clearly unable to resist cooing over 33-year-old Redmayne as she applauded him for his performance as physicist Stephen Hawking in The Theory Of Everything, for which he won the Golden Globe for best actor on Sunday.

The pair last worked together in 2006 film The Good Shepherd and no doubt had plenty to catch up on.

Redmayne found himself to be the centre of attention at the Critics’ Choice Awards in Los Angeles on Thursday evening.

Although he was snubbed for best actor on this occasion – with Michael Keaton taking the award instead for Birdman – Redmayne still proved to be the hottest act in the room.

Diane Kruger, 38, could not resist making a beeline for him, while fellow British star Rosamund Pike, 35, was more than delighted to share a joke with him having earned an Oscar nod herself for her turn in Gone Girl.

Newlywed Redmayne was without his wife Hannah Bagshawe but spent most of his time with his The Theory Of Everything co-star Felicity Jones, 31. 

The British actress plays Hawking’s first wife Jane and is nominated for best actress at the Oscars, which will be held on February 22.

Redmayne told the Daily Mail he was in pain when he learned of his Oscar nomination – having bashed his leg as his ran naked from bed to answer the door of his hotel room. ‘I was trying to grab a towel to protect my modesty,’ he said.

‘Someone was banging on the door and screaming. My manager was brandishing a phone and at the end of that phone someone was telling me I had been nominated.

‘I went from sleepy-eyed to pretty wide awake very fast. It was like going from nought to a hundred in a racing car. I have to say that I feel pretty damn good.’

Redmayne is no stranger to Hollywood having starred in My Week With Marilyn and the film adaptation of Les Miserables.

But his lead role as Hawking has catapulted him into the super league and made him an instantly recognisable face and name.
