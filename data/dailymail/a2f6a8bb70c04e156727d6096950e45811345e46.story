Younger siblings are more likely to take their own lives than their older brothers or sisters, a new study has today found.

The study, carried out at Stockholm University, estimated that more than 20 per cent of suicides could be influenced by birth order and a mother's age at child birth.

For each increase in a person's birth order, from eldest to youngest child, the suicide risk in adulthood went up 18 per cent, according to the study published in the American Journal of Epidemiology.

A study carried out at the University of Stockholm found younger siblings are more likely to commit suicide

Study leader Mikael Rostila, of the university's Centre for Health Equity Studies, told Live Science: 'Our findings are important, 
since they highlight that birth order should be considered an early-life
 circumstance that determines mental health across the life course.'

The report said: 'Recent studies have indicated that birth order is associated with suicide risk, with later-born children experiencing an increased risk of suicide.

'It has been estimated that more than 20 per cent of suicides might be attributable to the combined effects of maternal age at child birth and birth order.'

Researchers say they still do not understand why younger siblings may be at a higher risk of committing suicide.

It means there is little information researchers can pass on to family's to help protect youngest siblings.

The study also found that younger siblings were more likely to die from an accidents.

It suggests those with a higher birth order are more impulsive or risk-prone, which could contribute to suicide, researchers said.

It raises the possibility that 
younger brothers and sisters are more risk-prone or impulsive in general, which 
could contribute to suicide, the researchers said.

Several past studies have found birth order has an affected on a person's health.

A study in February found eldest siblings may have a higher risk of diabetes and heart disease, linked to a metabolic patterns in the womb.

Researchers say bullying by older siblings, the fact youngest children can be more impulsive and a lack of attention from parents could be reasons. File picture

But differences between families and parenting makes the affects difficult to judge.

Another study of 1.7 million people carried out in Norway found that for each increase in birth order, suicide risk went up 46 per cent, according to results published in the journal last year.

The new study replicated the findings from the research done in Norway.

Rostila and his team examined births and deaths of everyone born in Sweden between 1931 and 1980. They then recorded deaths from 1981 to 2002.

Their findings found the later a person's birth order was, the higher their risk for suicide was.

And the team found the link between birth order and suicide remained even when other factors, including the age difference between siblings, the number of siblings, their marital status and socioeconomic status was taken into account.

Rostilla said the reasons are not clear, but suggested bullying by older siblings, and the fact parents rarely lavish as much attention on later-borns as they did their first child, could play a part.

'Lower levels of attachment to parents because of restrictions in quality time could give rise to emotional and behavioral problems, separation stress and psychiatric disorders, thereby contributing to a higher suicide risk among later-born siblings,' Rostila said.

Another possibility is that the risk is linked to a biological explanation.

Greater stress during later pregnancies could lead to the unborn child being exposed to higher levels of the hormone cortisol, which affects brain development.

The World Health Organisation's latest statistics, for 2011, show Sweden's suicide rate is 11.1 suicides per 100,000 people.
