They are just tiny specks in a vast landscape of deep ridges which ripple  spectacularly, making North America's lowest, driest, and hottest place look like the surface of the moon or an alien planet.

The handful of intrepid walkers are the only signs of life in the baron desert and give a breathtaking sense of scale to Death Valley in these pictures from British travel photographer Chris Upton.

Mr Upton was on a driving holiday through Death Valley, in Eastern California's Mojave Desert, when he spotted the walkers on one of the ridges.

The 57-year-old from Nottinghamshire was there to photograph the sunrise but could not resist taking the set of snaps at Zabriskie Point in Badwater Basin.

British travel photographer Chris Upton caught an incredible sense of scale with these pictures taken while on a driving holiday through Death Valley, in Eastern California's Mojave Desert

Visiting the Zabriskie Point at sunrise, Mr Upton caught spectacular images of walkers set against giant ridges rippling through the valley

Death Valley stretches across about 3,000 square miles and its highest point is Telescope Peak in the Panamint Range which is  11,043 ft (3,366 metres) tall. The average annual rainfall in the vast and baron Death Valley desert is just 60mm

Zabriskie Point is made up of sediments from Furnace Creek Lake which dried up five million years ago - way before Death Valley was formed

Zabriskie Point is in the Badwater Basin - the lowest  lowest point in North America, at 282ft (86 metres) below sea level

Zabriskie Point sits on the edge of Death Valley's Furnace Creek, which holds the air temperature record at 56.7, recorded in July 10, 1913. But temperatures can drop below freezing at night during the winter

Death Valley got its name during the gold rush  from prospectors  who sought to cross the valley. Although, the name may be misleading, with only one death recorded during the period.

The oldest rocks in Death Valley National Park in California are thought to be at least 1,700 million years old

When Mr Upton came across the walkers they were too bunched up. But he said: 'Fortunately three disappeared over the ridge leaving the two walkers perfectly positioned to give some scale and context to the image...I had my shot'

Glacial lakes once filled Death Valley but about 10,500 years ago these lakes began to dry up, producing the desert environment seen today
