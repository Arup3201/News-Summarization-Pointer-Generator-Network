A terrifying new video shows two young men attempting to throw an elderly man off of a moving subway.

The cell phone video, posted by Diana Benbow, shows what appears to be two teenagers as they attack another man on a subway in Baltimore, Maryland, eventually opening up the doors off the moving car and trying to shove the man out. 

Luckily, they are ultimately unsuccessful.

Terrifying: Cell phone video captured the moment two teenagers ripped open the doors of a moving subway and tried to throw a man off the train

Back at it: The boys then kept going, attacking the man again and dragging him off to the door

Mass Transit Authority police in the city say that based on the video, they believe the train was either arriving or leaving the Mondawmin station.

The boys not only try to force the man out, but are also seen punching and hitting, and one point both boys are jumping on the man as others on the train just watch it all happen, offering no help. 

Even more shocking, neither the victim or anyone who witnessed the incident has come forward to share what happened with law enforcement officials.

As a result, many in the city are calling on the MTA to increase security at stations and on their trains.

'Frankly, the MTA police need to step their game up,' Councilman Nick Mosby told CBS Baltimore.

Authorities are asking anyone with information on the incident to call them at (410) 454-7720.
