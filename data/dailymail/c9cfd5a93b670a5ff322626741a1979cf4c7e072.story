The makers of Honey Maid graham crackers have come up with a
unique response to anti-gay backlash by some against its commercial featuring
two gay dads and their family. They printed out the negative comments and
turned them into a piece of art that spells out ‘Love.’

On March 10, Mondelez International, which manufactures the
popular crackers under the Nabisco brand, launched its ‘This is Wholesome’
advertising campaign. The commercial
features several different kinds of American families,including biracial
and gay ones.

The commercial, which has more than 4.7 million hits on YouTube,
starts off with the two dads huddled over their baby feeding a bottle. It then
cuts to the two men walking. Following, that it features other families doing everyday
things while enjoying Honey Maid crackers.

Honey Maid manufacturer Mondelez received some negative comments in response to the ad

At the end  of the 30-second
spot, the two dads are again seen, this time in front of their house, posing
with their baby and their other young son. A tagline accompanying the YouTube video reads, ‘No matter how things change, what makes us
wholesome never will.’

Since the ad ran, the comments
Mondelez has received have been overwhelmingly positive.

‘Beautiful commercial,’ one commenter wrote. ‘A
family is a family no matter what. Awesome job, Honey Maid. This is what the
world is, people will just have to accept that and open their minds to it. It's
a wonderful thing. Love is love.﻿’

However, the
company did receive a fair share of negative comments.

‘Nothing like exploiting the gay community for some
advertising and $,’ another person wrote. 
‘Keep your advertising where it belongs.’

In confronting the backlash, Mondelez on Thursday ended up
releasing another video, where the negative comments are used in a creative
way. The commercial shows some of the negative comments the company received.
It then shows two female artist rolling up tightly copies of the comments and then gluing them together.

Mondelez's creative response to the backlash was to spell out the word 'Love' in script using rolled up pieces of paper with the negative comments

The 'Love' paper sculpture of negative comments is greatly outnumbered by the scrolls of paper with positive feedback to the Honey Maid commercial featuring two dads

The camera pans away, showing the the rolled up pieces of
paper have been placed on the floor to spell out the word ‘Love’ in script.

But Mondelez didn’t stop there. The commercial goes on to
say that the company received ten times as many comments in support of the
original spot than negative ones. It then shows,in slow-motion, the scrolls of
paper with the positive comments surrounding the ‘Love’ paper sculpture to demonstrate the overwhelmingly positive response.

At the end of the video, a tagline reads, ‘Proving that only
one thing matters when it comes to family.’ It then cuts to the 'Love' paper sculpture.

‘Awesome reply to trolls!,’ one person commented. 'I don't
even eat graham crackers, but I think I might buy a box this weekend.﻿’

‘I
don't have enough thumbs to like this,’ wrote another. ‘I want 100 more.’

Mondelez isn’t the only food company to use non-traditional families
in commercials.

Last year, cereal maker General Mills received backlash
after airing a Cheerios commercial featuring 
a biracial family. However, the positive feedback was so overwhelming
that General Mills used the family again in a commercial it made for the Super
Bowl earlier this year.
