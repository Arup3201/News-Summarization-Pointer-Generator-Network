Adverts for Germanwings with the slogan 'get ready to be surprised' are being removed from the London tube network following Tuesday's crash.

The posters advertised low-cost flights to Germany and appeared in numerous tube carriages as well as on platforms.

The company asked for them to be taken down almost immediately after the incident, which killed 150 people.

The adverts, which have a picture of an air hostess as well as images of popular German destinations, said: 'Get ready to be surprised. Visit Germany.

'Enjoy the variety of Germany and fly to e.g. Berlin or Hamburg.'

A Transport for London spokesman confirmed they were taking the posters down as quickly as possible. 

They said: 'Our advertising department was contacted by the company and asked to remove the adverts on Tuesday. 

'We had 65 digital adverts that were taken down within an hour.

'We are in the process of removing larger sheet adverts at 17 stations. Five have already been removed and another ten will come down today.

French authorities installed a monument to honour the victims of flight, which was travelling from Barcelona to Dusseldorf 

The screams of passengers aware of their fate could be heard in the final seconds. They would have died immediately, prosecutors said.

Lufthansa said the aircraft was carrying citizens of 18 countries. Three Americans and three Britons were confirmed among the victims. 

Lubitz had been receiving psychiatric counselling right up until the crash, it emerged today. 

As well as having been signed off from training with depression in 2008, it was reported this morning that Lubitz had been continuing to receive mental health support. 

It was the deadliest air crash on the French mainland since 1974 when a Turkish Airlines plane crashed, killing 346 people.
