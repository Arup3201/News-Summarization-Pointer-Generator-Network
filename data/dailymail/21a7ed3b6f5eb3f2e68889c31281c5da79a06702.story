Ann Brennan, 49, died after becoming trapped under a forklift truck loading pallets of Pringles in Bristol, an inquest has heard

A woman was crushed to death by a forklift truck loading packets of Pringles, an inquest has heard.

Ann Brennan, 49, died following the accident, where she became trapped under a forklift truck loading pallets of the snacks in Bristol.

An inquest into her death heard that the warehouse, in the Avonmouth area of the city, had several previous 'near-misses'.

Coroner Gail Elliman today recorded a death of accidental death after half an hour of deliberation from the jury.

Annie’s sister Deborah Teagle, 51, said: 'Annie was such a bubbly, selfless character and she was a rock for the family, looking out for us all and caring for our dad.

'She enjoyed her job at the factory and had been there most of her working life. She was very loyal.

'When we received the call to say what had happened we were just in complete shock. It didn’t feel real that Annie, who was always so full of life, was gone.

'The emergency services and air ambulance were amazing and did everything they could to try and save her and we want to thank them for the amazing service they provide. Sadly, nothing could be done for Annie, but they save thousands of other lives every year.

'It has been very difficult to hear that safety precautions were lacking at the warehouse which may have saved Annie but we hope changes have been made at the warehouse and are working to protect other employees.

'Nothing will bring Annie back but it would give us some peace of mind to know her death was not completely in vain.'

A Bristol City Council investigation into health and safety at the warehouse is on-going and is likely to take another several months to conclude.

During the inquest a safety inspector said he had seen staff using loading equipment as scooters at Booker Wholesale cash and carry, in Avonmouth, as he studied CCTV recordings after the death of the warehouse assistant in 2011.

There was no speed limit and no segregation between pedestrians and vehicles in the loading bay where the fatal incident occurred.

Ms Brennan, a keen amateur rugby player, died after becoming trapped under a gas-powered forklift truck as it reversed in the warehouse in December 2011.

Paramedics found her heart had stopped when they arrived and she was not breathing.

She was resuscitated on the way to Frenchay Hospital in the air ambulance but died from multiple fractures and internal injuries shortly after arriving.

An inquest at Flax Bourton Coroner's Court yesterday heard that Ms Brennan was struck by a forklift truck driven by replenishment supervisor Ben Morris.

Mr Morris described how he was loading pallets of Pringles into the back of a lorry ready for delivery when the incident happened.

He said: 'As I was reversing round I looked over my shoulder and I couldn't see anything. Then I felt the rear left wheel lift up in the air.

'I slammed the brake on and I jumped out of the forklift and started screaming and that's all I can remember.'

Booker area manager Stephen French said he was at the store's front reception when he heard what had happened. When he arrived he found staff trying to lift the forklift off of Ms Brennan, which he said would have been impossible.

He said: 'It couldn't be done, but under the circumstances people were just trying to do whatever they could.'

Mr French was then questioned about health and safety measures in the warehouse, admitting there was 'no segregation policy at that time' between pedestrians and vehicles.

He added there was 'no existing policy in the goods-in area' and 'no speed limit'.

Ronald Crandon, the driver of the lorry which was being loaded at the time of the incident, told the court he had witnessed incidents in the past. He also added that he believed there were safety measures in place.

Mr Crandon said he had seen a 'near miss' and had a 'bump' with a forklift while using a pallet truck, which had led to lines being drawn to segregate pedestrians.

But Bristol City Council health and safety inspector Paul Tregale said there were no such measures in place.

He told the coroner it was the responsibility of the employer to prepare their work place to avoid contact by separating pedestrians from vehicles.

Mr Tregale said: 'There were no specific walkways for pedestrians and no marked areas.

'As far as I am aware there was nothing to separate the vehicles and pedestrians.

'Most of the staff weren't aware of the risk assessment in that area. The only control measure, if you can call it that, is to be aware that forklifts are operating.'

During his investigation Mr Tregale looked back at a random sample of working days through the company's CCTV.

He noted an 'untidy' warehouse with 'vehicles working in very close proximity to pedestrians'.

He added that there were no high visibility jackets being worn in the heavily stocked area and on one occasion he saw members of staff 'using a hand truck as a scooter'.
