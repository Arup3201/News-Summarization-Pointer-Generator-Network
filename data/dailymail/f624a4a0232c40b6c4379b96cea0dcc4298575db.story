We lounge on their beaches and relax in their hotels, but we can't actually pick out where our favourite summer holiday destinations are on a map.

Despite travelling more than ever before, Britons still struggle with their geography when it comes to pinpointing exactly where they have been, according to a new study.

When tested by Hotels.com, a shocking 74 per cent of Britons failed to identify summer hotspot Greece on a map, despite it being one of the most popular summer holiday destinations in Europe.

A further 54 per cent were unable to find Cyprus, where millions of Britons like to holiday in both the Greek-owned south and Turkish owned north each summer.

Worryingly, a further 12 per cent of those questioned confused South Africa with Spain and 10 per cent thought China was Brazil.

Americans could be offended too, after 10 per cent of those asked, believed Poland was the United States.

The country Britons had the most trouble identifying was Bulgaria, with 90 per cent marking it incorrectly, despite its rising popularity for sun and ski holidays.

Wedged between Romania, Serbia, Macedonia, Greece and Turkey, the Mediterranean hotspot left holidaymakers struggling to pick out exactly where exactly it was.

Travellers also had trouble with South East Asia,  with the location of Singapore stumping 88 per cent of people, while Thailand confused 66 per cent of respondents and 63 per cent misplaced Vietnam.

Spain - the most popular holiday destination for Britons - was the country that most people were able to identify, with just 26 per cent pinpointing its location incorrectly.

Kate Hopcraft of Hotels.com said, 'It's shocking to see so many Brits unable to pinpoint many of our most popular holiday destinations on a map. Despite the world getting smaller and people travelling more than ever, it seems when it comes to location, we don't always know exactly where we're going!"'
