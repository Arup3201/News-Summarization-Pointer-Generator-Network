Beach-goers held their breath on Sunday morning as two planes appeared to only just avoid a collision mid-air.

A Virgin aircraft that was preparing to land at Gold Coast Airport in Queensland was seen making a sharp turn at the last second just as a second aircraft appeared to be in its flight path at about 9.15am.

The second plane, a light Cessna aircraft, had taken off from Coolangatta as the Virgin jet neared the airport.

Witnesses told The Courier Mail that the Virgin Boeing 737 was 'flying really low and really fast' when it was forced to avoid the Cessna. 'Everyone was talking about it. It looked like if the Virgin plane had not pulled out there could have been a big problem,' one beach-goer said.

'They were very close to each other.'

The huge plane then flew around in a wide arc before attempting a second landing.

It landed safely at the airport just after a Qantas plane.

Despite landing at the airport safely shortly afterwards, a Virgin spokesperson confirmed the plane had been directed to perform a 'go around procedure' due to another plane's departure being delayed

A spokesperson for Virgin told the Courier Mail that the Virgin flight, which was arriving from Sydney, had been directed to perform a 'go around procedure' due to another plane's departure being delayed. 

Air Services Australia also assured that the incident was neither dangerous nor out of the ordinary.

'They were potentially going to come a little bit too close so a procedural assurance was given,' said the spokeswoman.

'There was never any danger to anyone and no loss of separation.'
