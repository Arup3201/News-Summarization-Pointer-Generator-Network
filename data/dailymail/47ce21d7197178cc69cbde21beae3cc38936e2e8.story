Paul Lambert insists Frank Lampard has made Manchester City stronger and believes he is Chelsea's loss.

The Aston Villa boss reckons Lampard's arrival has only served to help City, ahead of their visit to Villa Park on Saturday.

Lampard is on loan at the Etihad from New York City after leaving Stamford Bridge in the summer and has netted four goals in five games.

The 36-year-old scored twice at Villa Park in May 2013 to break Bobby Tambling's all-time scoring record for Chelsea.

And Lambert is not surprised at Lampard's form this season, insisting he is still on top of his game.

He said: 'He looks really top-drawer. I don't know him, but from the outside looking in everything about him is old-school.

'It doesn't matter how much he was getting to what he's getting now - I think you'll get him playing the same way. That's a big testament to him. He was always going to play the way he is playing. Maybe it's Chelsea's loss a little bit.

'Him coming in has made (City) stronger, no doubt about it.'

Defending Barclays Premier League champions City also added Bacary Sagna, Fernando and £32million defender Eliaquim Mangala to their squad in the summer.

'I think they're stronger,' said Lambert. 'The lads who have come in have certainly enhanced their strength. They are a powerful, powerful side.'

Villa stunned Manuel Pellegrini's side when they won 3-2 at home last season as they fought back from 1-0 and 2-1 down before Andreas Weimann's winner.

And Lambert believes his sixth-placed side can shock City again - but would prefer an easier game.

He added: 'You wouldn't want to come back twice. They are a top side, no doubt about it.

'They and Chelsea are the strongest sides physically in the league. But on any given day you can win a game.'
