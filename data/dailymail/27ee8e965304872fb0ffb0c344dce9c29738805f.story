First Great Western has been forced to cut ‘walk-on’ fares to the stricken West country by a quarter  following a backlash over alleged ‘profiteering.’

The action comes less 24 hours travellers were being forced to pay double for their journeys to and from the stricken West Country after the train company withdrew its ‘advance purchase’ discount tickets in the wake of storm damage chaos.

Whitehall sources said Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin had been ‘outraged’ when he read of the situation and had made ‘strong representations’ to the rail company to ensure passengers had a fair deal. 

Damage: Workmen carrying out limited repairs to the seafront and railway lines at Dawlish, Devon after a section of it was swept into the sea earlier this week

The minister announced the new train fare deal as he visited Dawlish in Devon where part of the line has collapsed into the sea.

It was being hailed today as a victory for disgruntled passengers facing a double-whammy of six weeks of disruption and higher travel costs.

The ticket row erupted after regular peak-time travellers who book well ahead for a heavily discounted ‘Advance’ tickets on specified peak-time services found on they were unable to do so.

First Great Western had denied ‘profiteering’ and insisted its action on services ‘West of Exeter’ was unavoidable following storms and the damage to the track.

This was the scene as waves whipped up by stormy weather crashed over the train tracks on Dawlish's seaside line

Repair: Railway workers continue to inspect the main Exeter to Plymouth railway line that has been closed due to parts of it being washed away by the sea

Network Rail say it will take ‘at least six weeks’ to re-open the Dawlish line.

But yesterday in response to the backlash, First Great Western confirmed a ‘25 per cent discount on walk-up fares for services affected by Dawlish line closure.

In a statement the train company said: ‘First Great Western has confirmed it will be offering discounted fares to customers travelling on its services affected by the closure of the railway at Dawlish.’

It added; ‘Advance Purchase fares will also be reintroduced on the route for combined bus and rail fares from Wednesday next week. The company has been unable to offer Advance Purchase tickets – which are tied to specific trains - since Wednesday, as we were unable to guarantee which trains would be running.’

FGW also said: ’A 25 per cent discount will apply to all walk-up fares - including Any time, Off-Peak and Super Off-Peak tickets - for journeys that pass through the affected area, and will remain in place until the line reopens.’

With high tides combined with gale force winds and further heavy rain, some parts of the UK are bracing themselves for more flooding

Prices: Normally, a full-price ‘Anytime’ single ticket from Penzance costs £142 while a pre-booked ‘Advance’ ticket may be half that

First Great Western managing director, Mark Hopwood said: ‘We recognise that this work will mean customers are inconvenienced, and journey times are likely to take longer than normal as we look at alternative ways of getting customers to where they need to go. We want our prices to reflect that.

‘No-one should lose out because of this. FGW's promise is that anyone who has been unable to purchase an Advance Purchase ticket because they were removed from the system and paid more than they would have done normally, will be reimbursed the difference.’

Normally, a full-price ‘Anytime’ single ticket from Penzance costs £142 while a pre-booked ‘Advance’ ticket may be half that.

The alarm was raised when a regular commuter who travels peak-time to London Paddington on a First Great Western service from Castle Cary in Somerset with the added benefit of a senior rail  discount noticed he was unable to buy his usual Advance Single ticket costing £27.85 and was forced instead to buy for Monday a full fare single ticket for £63.70.

‘Initially I wondered whether for some reason there was heavy demand and I had simply left it late to book, but I checked prices for the next Monday – February  17 -  and it is the same. No Advance Single tickets available - only the full fare at £63.70. So effectively the fare has doubled.’

The full Anytime single- without the senior rate discount costs £96.50.
