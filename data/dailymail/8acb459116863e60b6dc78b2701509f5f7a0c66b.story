Zero tolerance security guard Darien Long has lost his job after posting online videos showing his tough stance with troublemakers at the mall where he works.

Mr Long, who made headlines last month after a video showing him tasering a violent woman outside Atlanta's Metro Mall was posted online – has told how he will be out of a job on April 1.

He blamed a host of factors including 'the police', a recent raid at the mall, and the publicity surrounding his no-nonsense approach to his job for him being asked to leave at the end of this month.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS

Asked why he was losing his job, Mr Long said: 'I think it's the result of a lot of things; the police, the raid that just recently happened... the publicity.

'It's not just one thing, it's all the things.'

Meanwhile it was reported today that Mr Long was arrested after he allegedly ran up to a man in the Metro Mall and tackled him to the floor.

Yesterday's alleged arrest reportedly came after Mr Long said he had warned the man not to return to the mall but could not prove that he had.

Mr Long became an internet sensation worldwide after videos appeared showing him tasering people he decided were troublemakers at the Atlanta mall.

One video showed him tasering a woman to
the ground in front of a small child after she shouted abuse, pushed 
him, and threatened to 'beat' him.

In another, he is shown using a taser
on a man named Marcus Purnell after he refused to leave the mall and 
became abusive, telling the guard 'You better watch your back.'

Mr
Long has defended his work, saying a tough stance is needed in the 
downtown neighborhood where he works, where the mall is popular spot for
drug-dealers, vagrants and thieves.

Mr Long, who later told the Huffington Post that his dismissal may be because of revenue issues, predicted that the miscreants will flood back into the mall as soon as he leaves his job there.

He said:
'Within two or three days the drug-dealers will start to come back in, 
probably the same day, like April 1 once they know I'm not there, 
they'll all come back in.'

The security guard, who daily faced threats, abuse and violence in his job, says he may have trouble finding work in the same field and was not sure what he would do next.

He wore body armor with a video camera strapped onto his chest, and put clips of the aggression he encountered up on the net.

After he posted films showing the above encounters, and others similar online, supporters praising his tough approach donated more than 
$20,000 in an online campaign.

Well-wishers who gave money posted messages on Reddit including: ‘Whatever they pay this guy, it's
not enough’, ‘Guy looks like a family man, looks like he is risking a 
lot’ and ‘remind anyone of a sheriff in a wild west movie.

One Youtube viewer simply wrote: ‘Why do those naggers keep nagging him?

Reddit editor Ryu Kenya said they started the campaign because Long is a ‘nice guy’.

‘He is a nice guy and that area is very dangerous,' he wrote on the website. 'There is a cop 
station around the block but people still sell drugs around there.

'He 
has to wear kevlar and has his own mugshot book. He was not too proud 
about tasing the woman and wished it could have been avoided.’

And since then more and more videos are emerging of the zero-tolerance guard refusing to give in to violent threats.

In the footage, filmed by a camera on Long’s uniform, men are heard warning they’ll follow him home; he is racially abused; spat at; threatened with violence and objects are thrown at him all because he’s asked people to leave the shopping center or to stop hovering outside.
