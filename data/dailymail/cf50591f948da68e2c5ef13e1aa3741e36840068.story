British fashion designer John Galliano has been stripped of France’s highest civilian award – because of his conviction for racism.

The 51-year-old was made a Legion d'Honneur three years ago by the then conservative President Nicolas Sarkozy.

But a year ago Galliano was found guilty of making ‘public insults based on origin, religious affiliation, race or ethnicity’.

The conviction resulted in a fine equivalent to just under £50,00 and related to a series of anti-Semitic rants in his local Paris bar.

Now Francois Hollande, France’s new Socialist President, has taken the almost unprecedented step of revoking the award.

The decision was published in a decree signed by the head of state and published in the country's official journal.

Galliano lost his job as artistic director of the Dior fashion house over the comments, which he blamed on his addictions to drugs and alcohol.

During his Paris trial, a criminal court heard how, in February 2010, Galliano spat poisonous words at museum curator Geraldine Bloch about being Jewish.

He also subjected a friend of Ms Bloch, who was of South Asian origin, to racist abuse.

In a third incident, the court saw an amateur video of Galliano declaring a love for Adolf Hitler and referring to Jews being gassed in concentration camps.

Galliano has kept a low profile since his conviction, with some reports suggesting he is considering a full-time move to Los Angeles.

The Legion d'Honneur is given to those who have served France, or the ideals of liberty, equality and fraternity which it upholds.

Galliano became creative director at Dior in 1996, and won British Fashion Designer of the Year four times.
