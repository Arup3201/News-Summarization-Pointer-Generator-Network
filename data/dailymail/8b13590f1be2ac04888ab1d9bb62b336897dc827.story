With just five days to go until the hottest fashion collaboration of the year lands (that's Kate Moss for Topshop, for anyone who's been living under a rock), the high street shopping giant are ramping up the excitement.

The store has released a behind the scenes film of Kate and Arcadia boss Sir Philip Green curating the collection - and it's refreshing to see just how much input Kate has had on her eponymous range.

The notoriously elusive supermodel can be seen chatting away about her inspirations and exactly what she wants from the range, while a semi-bored looking Sir Philip provides his musings.

Tell me you don't love this? Sir Philip Green stars in a behind the scenes fashion video with Kate Moss ahead of her collection launch - and it appears that the Topshop boss is her biggest fan

A bubbly Kate tries on a few of her upcoming designs while providing a running commentary such as 'I love the fringing' and 'this is great for festivals'.

She then does her own mini catwalk show, partakes in a few twirls and pouts in front of the mirror, while Sir Philip comments: 'That's Kate to a T' about one of the dresses before the pair share a tender hug.

Is someone excited? Kate, who is usually rather elusive, is bubbly, chatty and excitable in the short clip

Guess who I'm with...?! Sir Philip holds his rather vintage Nokia phone to Kate's ear during a brainstorming session

What do you think, Phil? Kate, 40, can be seen spinning around in one of her fringed waistcoats as Sir Philip provides his musings

The model's SS14 collection, which lands on April 30, is full of Seventies-style pieces, including fringed suede jackets, jump suits and maxi dresses.

There are also embroidered smock-tops, silk blouses and graphic print kaftans that will go on sale in high street stores globally and online.

Kate is said to have taken 
inspiration from her own wardrobe, which, despite her status as a 
supermodel, isn't just full of designer labels. She's also a fan of 
scouring the rails of second-hand stores. 

A
 weave waistcoat, suede shorts and a deep blue fringed jacket are all in
 keeping with the Seventies vibe. The latter is said to be inspired by a
 jacket the 40-year-old has worn to three Rolling Stones concerts which 
she refers to as her 'gig 
jacket'.

As well as 
channelling a vintage look, she was also keen to reflect her laidback 
style. There are baggy pyjama trousers glammed up through the use satin 
material in distinct prints and cool kaftans perfect for hitting the 
beach in over the summer.

Vintage vibe: The collection includes maxi dresses for evening and day wear with many items inspired by Kate's own wardrobe

Print kaftans and blouses are a wardrobe staple for jetsetter Kate, while a girl can't have enough LBDs

For evening wear, there are sexy frilled flapper style dresses and long numbers that flash a hint of thigh. Many of the dresses are also in keeping with the vintage-feel with fringing, sequins and  crepe satin.

Meanwhile there are also some tailored pieces for smart office wear including tuxes and trouser suits and summery floral printed shirts.

While much of the collection will be sold at affordable prices, one dress is a more pricey Â£600.

The high price tag is to reflect the handiwork that went into creating the densely hand-beaded dress.

Kate first collaborated with Topshop in 2007 before taking a break to work on other projects.

Party dresses: The spring/summer collection also includes day wear and tailored pieces

Lucrative partnership: Sir Philip Green is delighted Kate is back designing for the British High Street store

The mother-of-one announced last year that she would be reprising her role as a designer for the British brand.

Topshop's Sir Philip Green, who counts the model as a friend, said he was delighted she decided to return to his fashion stable.He said: 'I am personally thrilled that Kate wanted to come back to Topshop to work with us again. The first time around was such a lot of fun and she has been sorely missed. The Topshop business has developed extensively around the globe since we launched with Kate in 2007.'

Kate added: 'I have really missed being involved in the design process, and working with the team at Topshop. I am very excited to create a new collection that bears my name.

'Now more than ever with London being at the forefront of fashion as it feels like I'm back home.
