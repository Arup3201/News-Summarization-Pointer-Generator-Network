A TV programme that will recreate the death of actor Robin Williams has been branded 'grotesque' and 'beyond comprehension'.

His death will be played out in a documentary series called Autopsy that has also examined the last hours of celebrities such as Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston and Brittany Murphy. 

It is thought the man portraying him in the episode is a professional Robin Williams lookalike from France called Alain Poudensan, who has also starred in adult films under the name Alain L'Yle. 

His website shows a picture of him grinning in front of the camera with his arm around Williams.

A family friend told the Daily Mirror: 'With each passing day the pain for Robin's family eases just a fraction but something as disturbing as this just takes them backwards.

'Why anyone would want to make such a programme is beyond comprehension. His wife and family will be utterly dismayed that someone is seeking to profit from Robin's death in such a grotesque way.

'The producers should be ashamed of themselves. I hope people refuse to watch.'

The father-of-three was found hanged at his home in Marin County, California, in August, aged 63

The 63-year-old Oscar-winning actor was found dead in his California home on August 11 in what authorities soon ruled a suicide. 

A coroner's report ruled Williams died from asphyxia due to hanging. 

He had been suffering from the early stages of Parkinson's disease at the time of his death, his wife said.   

Susan Schneider said her husband had been sober but 'not yet ready to share publicly' his struggles with Parkinson's.

She added that he had also been suffering from anxiety and depression.

Williams shot to fame in the late 1970s as an alien in the US TV comedy series Mork & Mindy.

But it was his role as an irreverent DJ with the US Armed Services Radio station in Good Morning, Vietnam in 1987 which won him huge acclaim.

His roles ranged from serious and dramatic in films such as Dead Poets Society and Good Will Hunting, to comedy in Mrs Doubtfire.

He was nominated for an Oscar three times before winning an Academy Award for his performance as a psychologist in Good Will Hunting in 1997.  

Channel 5 confirmed to MailOnline it is filming the documentary about the actor. It is unknown if it will also air in the US. 

The broadcaster refused to comment any further.
