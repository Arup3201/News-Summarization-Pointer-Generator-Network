A pregnant Florida woman with a strange infatuation with One Direction heartthrob Harry Styles faces criminal charges after she allegedly beat a 57-year-old woman with a cane earlier this week over an argument about butter.

But 24-year-old Jennifer Feagley isn't to blame for the violent attack - according to Feagley, her pregnancy hormones made her do it.

Authorities were called to a home on Pearl Street in Daytona Beach at 9:19 p.m. Tuesday after the victim, 57-year-old Patricia Marson, called 9-1-1 to report that she had been attacked.

Hormones: Feagley-Styles claims her pregnancy hormones made her attack a 57-year-old woman with a cane

Marson told police that Feagley was heating butter on a stove in the moments leading up to the attack. When Marson asked Feagley why she was heating the butter, Feagley flew into a rage.

According to an arrest report first obtained by the Daytona Beach News-Journal, Feagley started the attack by hitting Marson in the head, knocking her to the floor.

She then got on top of Marson and started punching her in the chest and choking her.

But the punches and choking apparently wasn't enough.

History: Prior to this week's attack, Ms. 'Styles' has been arrested twice for battery

Violent: Authorities say that Feagley choked the victim before hitting with a cane at least five times

After pummeling the woman with her fists, Feagley grabbed Marson's cane and started beating her with it.

According to the report, Marson was hit with the cane at least five times.

Following her arrest, Feagley explained to police that she was six months pregnant and that her hormones are what caused her to act out.

But this isn't Feagley's found herself on the wrong side of the law - according to arrest records, she's been in custody at least two other times, both of which were arrests for battery.

Feagley is unemployed, but on Facebook lists her occupation as 'being married to Harry Styles.'

She's even changed her name on the social media website to 'Jenn Styles' to reflect her fictitious job.
