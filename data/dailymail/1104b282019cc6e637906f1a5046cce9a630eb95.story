TV presenter Adrian Chiles has been forced to apologise over jokes about Polish football fans.

Chiles, whose mother is Croatian, blundered during ITV's coverage of England's 4-1 win over Montenegro when discussing the next World Cup qualifying match at Wembley against Poland.

Speaking at the end of the match, 
Chiles said: 'It’s practically a home game for Poland – 15,000 Poles 
will be in here, I’m sure.'

Joke: ITV presenter Adrian Chiles had to apologise for a quip about Polish builders working at his home when talking about England's chances against the Poles at Wembley in a vital World Cup qualifier

Pundit Lee Dixon then responded: 'Hopefully, they’re all crying at the 
end.' To which Chiles said: 'I’m trying to get some building work done 
at the moment, quite seriously. Be careful.'

In a statement, Chiles said: 'I made the remark in relation to the nice Polish builders currently working at my place, who I knew would already be fed up having watched their team lose to Ukraine.

'No offence was intended - apart from anything else I could hardly be prouder of my own East European background.

'But to anyone who thought what I said constituted some kind of lazy stereotyping, and was offended by it, I certainly apologise.'

Quip: Adrian Chiles told his guests during the show that England's games at Wembley was 'practically a home game for Poland - 15,000 Poles will be in here I'm sure'

His remarks had been greeted with smiles and 
laughter from guests Dixon, Arsenal and England forward Theo Walcott and
 former Manchester United star Roy Keane.

But the quips sparked outrage 
on social media sites, with hundreds of tweets and a number of people 
calling for him to be sacked for racial stereotyping.

One
 tweeter, Stephanie M, said: 'I was very disappointed by Adrian Chiles' 
comments tonight, thought they were inappropriate. No place for casual 
racism on TV.

Another, 
Anthony Timmons, posted: '@itvfootball Adrian Chiles' comments tonight 
on the Polish were disgraceful. What are you going to do about it?!'

Studio guests: Roy Keane, Theo Walcott and Lee Dixon gave their post-match verdicts after the Montenegro game when Chiles made his jokes

Many of the tweets were more abusive towards the presenter, who was a trending subject on the social media site after the match.

This is not the first time the presenter, who has been with ITV Sport since 2010, has made a comment about Polish people in the UK.

After the 1-1 draw with the Republic of Ireland in May he commented that when Poland visited Wembley it would 'be like a home game' for them.

Chiles is no stranger to controversy, the West Brom supporter called former Albion player Peter Odemwingie a 't**t' at the club's awards evening at the end of last season - he later rang the player to apologise.

Police expect a quarter of the 90,000 crowd will be cheering Poland when they meet England at Wembley in the vital World Cup qualifying game on Tuesday.

In addition to the country’s official allocation, a huge number of UK-based Poles have snapped up tickets.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said the force was ‘not overly concerned’ about the large number  of away fans, despite the potential for violence.

England head into the final set of fixtures leading Group H by a point. They must win the game to qualify automatically for next year’s finals in Brazil.

The alternative is that they will face the hazardous play-offs as any other result would mean relying on winless San Marino to take points from Ukraine, who are second in in the group.
