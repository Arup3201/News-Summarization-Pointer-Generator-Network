A wanted man was captured by police on Friday evening after his attempts to exchange cocaine-coated currency at a bank's drive-up window resulted in employees contacting authorities.

One teller at the San Luis Valley Federal Bank in Monte Vista, Colorado, complained of tingly and numb hands after handling the money of Joseph Michael Gutierrez, 24, of Del Norte, Colorado. The cash was also described as moist and having a strange odor.

Monte Vista Police officers soon arrived, and arrested Gutierrez, who was booked into the Rio Grande County Jail on several outstanding misdemeanor failure-to-appear warrants.

Monte Vista Police Chief Jim Grayson told the Alamosa Valley Courier that officers from his department responded to a possible hazardous material call at the bank at approximately 5:42 p.m. on Friday.

Once there, they found Gutierrez attempting to exchange numerous one-dollar bills for larger bills. 

The San Luis Valley Hazardous Materials unit soon responded to the scene, where field tests for hazardous materials were negative, but a sample of the bills did test positive for the presence of cocaine.

On April 8 of this year, Gutierrez was summoned for driving with a revoked license, theft less than $100, and possession of drug paraphernalia.

It has been reported that up to 90 per cent of bills in the United States carry traces of cocaine.
