Former University of Montana Grizzlies quarterback Jordan Johnson 'changed into a totally different person' before he allegedly raped a 21-year-old student in her bedroom, the woman has testified.

Taking the stand yesterday, the third day of Johnson's trial, the alleged victim described how she at first enjoyed kissing the 20-year-old when she invited him over to watch a video on February 4, 2012, but repeatedly told him 'no' when he tried to take it further.

'He didn't say anything. He just changed – just changed into a totally different person,' she told jurors. Johnson then ordered her to turn onto her front, threatening: 'Turn over or I'll make you.'

When the student refused, he flipped her over and raped her, she said.

'It hurt so bad, it hurt so bad,' the alleged victim said, breaking down in tears.

In response to questions from both the prosecution and defense, the young woman, who hasn't been named, explained how the pair lay on her bed, kissed and even took each others tops off as her roommate played video games in the living room.

But she told the seven-woman, five-man jury that she was very clear when she wanted things to stop.

'I gave him very clear instructions. I told him, "No, not tonight." I resisted with my arms, resisted with my knees ... I told him no,' she said.

The woman told prosecutors that she had never been as afraid in her life as she was during the incident.

She said she was in utter shock after the alleged rape took place, which is why she didn't call out to her roommate for help and drove Johnson home afterwards.

'You could have screamed for help,' Assistant Attorney General Joel Thompson said, according to Missoulian.com.

'Could have,' she agreed. 'You didn't,' he said. 'I didn't. There's no real explanation other than I was terrified and in shock. You know how when you have those dreams and you want to scream so bad, but you can't? It was like that.'

Towards the end of Wednesday's 
testimony, which was attended by Grizzlies football coach Mick Delaney 
and former athletic director Jim O'Day, the woman accused Johnson of 
having committed similar attacks against other women in the past.

Johnson claims the sex was consensual.

The trial in Missoula, which began on Monday, has divided the local community where passions about Grizzly football run high.

Aggressive: The alleged victim of former University of Montana quarterback Jordan Johnson claims he 'changed' and forced her to have sex with him when she invited him to hers to watch a movie

Prosecutor Adam Duerk said during 
opening statements on Monday: 'He changed. His demeanor changed. He 
became very aggressive and in her words "it got very scary really 
fast."'

However, Johnson's defense attorney Kirsten Pabst said the alleged victim 'participated' in the sex.

She told jurors: 'She participated. 
She continued. But the fact that he didn't give her a relationship 
doesn't mean what happened that night was a crime.'

Johnson was dressed in a white shirt as he listened to the statements.

The student was the first witness called by the prosecution.

Duerk asked her: 'Did you in any way plan to have sex with him.'

She replied: 'No'.

When asked what her expectations were that night, the woman is heard to reply in a video broadcast by ABC News: 'I just wanted to get to know him. I didn't really hang out with him since a year prior.

'Just kind of get to know him again and see how school is going.'

The case has played out against a backdrop of NCAA and federal investigation of the school athletic department and the manner in which
rape allegations are reported on campus, investigated by police, and 
prosecuted by the Missoula County Attorney's Office.

District Judge Karen Townsend 
initially called 400 potential jurors for the high-profile case, such 
was the difficulty in finding neutral jurors.

An
affidavit supporting the rape charge said Johnson and the alleged 
victim had known each other since 2010 and decided to watch a movie at 
her house.

The woman told investigators Johnson held her down and forced her to have sex with him in her room despite her protests. 

Court
records show the woman texted her roommate: 'Omg... I think I might 
have just gotten raped... he kept pushing and pushing and I said no but 
he wouldn't listen... I just wanna cry... Omg what do I do!'

Johnson says the woman flirted with him the day before and consented to the sex the following night.

Johnson was briefly suspended from the football team then reinstated when a civil no-contact order replaced the restraining order.

Three
days after coach Robin Pflugrad welcomed Johnson back, Engstrom 
announced he was not renewing the contracts of the coach and athletic 
director Jim O'Day.

Both were immediately relieved of their duties, without an explanation from Engstrom.

The move came after a season when Montana advanced to the Football Championship Subdivision semifinal game.

In December 2011, UM President Royce Engstrom ordered an outside investigation after 
two students reported being drugged and raped.

Former
Supreme Court Justice Diane Barz later said her investigation found 
nine alleged rapes or sexual assaults involving students had occurred 
between September 2010 and December 2011, including at least two that 
hadn't been reported.

One led to former Montana football player Beau Donaldson pleading guilty to rape and being sentenced to 10 years in prison.

Engstrom
said in January the investigation 'indicated an association with 
patterns of behavior from a small number of student-athletes.'

'We will not tolerate the tarnishing of the proud tradition of Grizzly athletics,' he said at the time.

Barz
suggested training faculty and staff on how to handle and report sexual
assault allegations and rewriting student and student-athlete conduct 
codes.

Just weeks later, the university came 
under more criticism after the dean of students notified a Saudi 
national about sexual assault and rape allegations made against him.

The student fled the country before the alleged victims could file a police report.

The
Grizzlies have advanced to the national title game seven times since 
1995, winning twice. The team's success came even as players and former 
players were arrested for drunken driving, assault and other charges.

Last
April, the federal Department of Education announced it was 
investigating a complaint alleging the university discriminated against 
female students, faculty and staff by failing to address a sexually 
hostile environmental caused by its failure to appropriately respond to 
reports of sexual assault.

Soon
after, the U.S. Justice Department announced its investigation into the
handling of rape investigations and prosecutions, and the school 
announced in May the NCAA had been investigating its athletic programs 
for undisclosed reasons.

The
Department of Education closed the discrimination
complaint this month because the allegations were being addressed by the 
Department of Justice investigation.

The Justice Department and NCAA investigations continue.

Johnson's trial continues and is expected to last two to three weeks.
