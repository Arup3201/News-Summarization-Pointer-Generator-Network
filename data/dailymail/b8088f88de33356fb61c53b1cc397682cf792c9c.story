Chelsea's £40million-a-year club record shirt sponsorship deal with The Yokohama Rubber Company, announced on Thursday evening, will help to guarantee that the Premier League’s shirt deals are collectively worth twice as much as those in the next most lucrative league, Germany’s Bundesliga.

Chelsea have signed a five-year deal worth £200m with the Japanese tyre giants, meaning they now have the second highest shirt sponsorship deal in England, indeed in the world, after Manchester United.

United’s deal with Chevrolet was agreed and signed in 2012 on terms of $559m (£332.6m) over seven years, starting with this season, 2014-15. At the exchange rates applicable at the time of the deal, that makes United’s deal worth £47m-a-year.

Liverpool's shirt sponsorship deal with Standard Chartered is worth around £20m a year

Chelsea’s deal with Yokohama is even more massive than the deals currently in place at Europe’s biggest, richest and most financially savvy clubs - Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich. That trio have current agreements respectively with Emirates, Qatar Airways and Deutsche Telekom each worth around €30 million per year, or about £25m a year at the exchange rates in place at the time.

The upshot of the Chelsea deal is that the 20 current Premier League clubs have shirt sponsorship deals in place or upcoming collectively worth a staggering £216.35m, according to exclusive analysis by Sportsmail.

That means the average deal is worth more than £10m a year, or £10.8m per club to be precise. Of course within the division there are huge variations. After United and Chelsea, Arsenal make £30m a year from Emirates, Liverpool make £20m a year from Standard Chartered and Manchester City make £20m a year from Etihad. At the other end of the scale, Crystal Palace’s deal with Neteller is worth not quite £1m and Southampton, Burnley and Leicester have deals worth £1m a year - although those will grow if in the Premier League next season.

According a new authoritative study published this week by industry analysts Repucom, the 18 clubs of the Bundesliga have shirt deals worth £101m collectively - or less than half the Premier League levels when Chelsea’s new deal is factored in. That works out at £5.6m per Bundesliga club per season.

Repucom’s European Football Jersey Report looks at shirt deals across Europe’s major leagues and shows that the La Liga clubs in Spain collectively have deals worth £82m, with more than half that sum at Barca and Real Madrid alone, and the equivalent sums elsewhere are £70m in France’s Ligue 1, £60m in Italy’s Serie A and £31m in the top flight in the Netherlands.

Chelsea’s new deal shows the staggering earning potential for ‘super clubs’ with genuine global followings, and highlights the global nature of the Premier League as so many foreign companies seek to use English football to sell their wares to an international audience.

This season 14 shirts feature overseas-based companies, compared to 10 last season. Companies from the United Arab Emirates, South Korea (Samsung, to be replaced by Yokohama), the US, the Philippines, South Africa, Thailand and China are represented.

Despite a football-wide ban on betting, gambling companies continue to feature prominently in the Premier League. This season five shirts feature gambling companies: those at Aston Villa (Dafabet.com), Stoke (Bet365), Hull (12Bet), Burnley (Fun88) and West Ham (Betway) – compared to three last season.

The total value of the Premier League’s shirt deals have doubled in five seasons. In 2010-11 (details here) they were worth £100.45m.
