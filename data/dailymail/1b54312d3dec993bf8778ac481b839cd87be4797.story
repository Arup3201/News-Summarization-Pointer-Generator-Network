Anchorage couple Chris and Susie Linford were surprised after their debit card details were stolen and the thief went on a $5,000 shopping spree at their expense.

Their credit union quickly intercepted the fraud, however, and the Linfords were not left out of pocket.

So the real shock came when a series of weird and wonderful items were delivered to their home - clearly Christmas gifts ordered to the wrong address by the criminal who had cloned their cards.

Chris and Susie Linford suddenly started receiving a weird selection of parcels at their home. The fraudster had mistakenly sent them his shopping, including an Atlanta Braves baseball bat and a $900 Dale Earnhardt Jr. signed print

Mrs Linford told the Anchorage Daily News that she was working from home one day in mid-December when the parcels began to arrive.

The first package contained a JVC stereo and a radar detector. Then, as Susie explained, 'the boxes started coming pretty quick, a couple of deliveries a day.'

Next to arrive was a baseball bat signed by former Atlanta Braves third baseman Chipper Jones, then an autographed and framed portrait of stock car racer Dale Earnhardt Jr.

The next orders were more practical - four North Face jackets and martial arts equipment such as gloves and shin pads.

The first item to gifted by the thief was a JVC stereo

Mrs Linford told the Anchorage Daily News that, from this selection, she believed the generous thief was a 20- to 30-year-old male.

But the next arrival was a $50 linen scrapbook, followed by an expensive women's coat. The criminal was clearly doing his Christmas shopping

He was mistakenly sending his ill-gotten gains to the billing address rather than an alternative delivery address.

Strangely, the Linfords then received a letter from a fruit of the month club, regretting the fact that they didn't deliver to Alaska.

As the couple say that their debit cards were never out of their possession, the thief must have got hold of their details online.

And Susie told ABC News that her favorite gift from the fraudulent shopper was, ironically, software protection software.

The mysterious buyer also sent a radar detector for his car, but he didn't get any benefit out of this crime

The final package was a large corner shelf for plants. After the holidays, the Linfords began to track down where the presents had come from, and where they had to be sent back to.

As it the transactions were seemingly made online rather than in person, the couple were not legally required to return the gifts.

'We were told you’re welcome to keep it, but I thought no that’s not right,' Mrs Linford told ABC. So she is now returning the items one-by-one.

The couple tracked IP addresses for the orders to properties in Illinois and Kansas It seems that the thief had no plans to pick up the merchandise in Alaska the whole episode was a series of oversights.

The absent-minded buyer has yet to be identified and it is unknown whether his family and friends received any Christmas presents this year. 

He also sent four North Face jackets to his victims, but the Linfords are returning everything they were sent in error
