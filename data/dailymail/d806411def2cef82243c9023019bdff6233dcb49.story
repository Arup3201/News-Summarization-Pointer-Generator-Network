Security guards are hired to keep the crooks out, not let them in.

But that's what happened at a New York City McDonald's early Sunday morning - and the worker found himself locked in the bathroom as the fast-food restaurant was robbed.

The unidentified guard, who probably won't be getting employee of the month, was patrolling the closed fast-food restaurant on Varick Street in lower Manhattan.

At around 4:40 a.m., two men in their 20s knocked on the door and asked to be let in so they could use the ATM.

A trusting soul, the security guard agreed and opened the door.

But once inside, one of the men pulled a black and silver revolver out of his pocket and ordered the guard into the bathroom, locking him inside.Â

The pair then ordered the rest of the employees to get on the floor, and they complied.

They took about $200 in cash from one of the workers and grabbed about $2,800 from the safe, police sources told The New York Post.

Police released a surveillance video showing the suspects calmly walking on the street before and after the heist.

One is wearing combat shorts and the other a white baseball cap and T-shirt.

As they walk away, the men are accompanied by a third man who police suspect was acting as a lookout.

No arrests have been made but detectives are appealing for information.
