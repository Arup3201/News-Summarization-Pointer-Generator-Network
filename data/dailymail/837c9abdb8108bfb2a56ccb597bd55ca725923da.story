Furniture removal man Jack Turley has been given the job of carrying Edinburgh to victory over four-time Pro12 champions Leinster after a shock call-up from head coach Alan Solomons.

The New Zealander had spent most of the week moving sofas, cabinets and tables in and out of houses for the Green Van and Man company — and fully expected to play amateur rugby in his role as Heriot’s captain against Glasgow Hawks this weekend.

On his first day’s training with Edinburgh, however, he was told by Solomons that he wasn’t there to simply make up the numbers and would, in fact, be starting at the Royal Dublin Showground – one of the citadels of world club rugby.

Turley admitted his sudden elevation has been ‘like a whirlwind’, with injuries to five out of the six second rows at the capital club leading to him being thrown in against one of the greatest sides in the northern hemisphere.

‘It has been an incredible week,’ said the 25-year-old, who played in the same New Zealand Schools Select team as 2011 World Cup-winning All Blacks Israel Dagg and Sam Whitelock.

‘I have gone from playing 80 minutes for Heriot’s against Gala on Saturday to playing on Monday night for the Edinburgh A team against a touring Canadian side to training with the full Edinburgh squad on Thursday.

‘When the call came to train, I thought it was one of the boys pulling my leg. Then I was told I was starting and ever since then I have been trying to take in a lot of information in a short amount of time, get clued up on the systems and calls and everything.

‘It has been a bit of a whirlwind and I’ll try and do a bit of homework and get it all sorted for the match.

‘I know it is a real challenge to do well against Leinster at the RDS but I haven’t even had time to work out who I am up against or to worry about them as I am just trying to get myself in the right frame of mind for the game.

‘It’s going to be awesome. I have never even been to Ireland before and to start against Leinster is a great chance for me to see how I fare against the big boys.

‘I know this is sink or swim for me but it is a great, exciting opportunity — I want to take full advantage of.’

The chance to show what he can do in the professional ranks is a dream come true for Turley, who left Christchurch in 2012 to try and make it in Scottish rugby.

His first year at Heriot’s was disrupted by injury but this season he has been in great form and helped his club to the top of the BT Premiership.

‘Being a pro rugby player is what it is about,’ he admitted. ‘It is something I want to aspire to and part of the reason why I came over here to Scotland.

‘I know the game will be a lot faster than I am used to and more physical. I will have to rise to the challenge and show what I can do at this level.’

Turley said his work were delighted at his call-up and had no hesitation in giving him as much time off as he needed.

‘I do a few days removals work and do some coaching at Fettes College at times,’ said the Auckland-born second row. ‘It is mostly furniture removal and it is run by one of the guys at Heriot’s who started a small business and hired some of the guys to help shift things.

‘The boss plays out of Heriot’s and he was just as chuffed as I was and has given me a few days off.’

Edinburgh's squad has been ravaged by injuries, meaning they have no choice but to turn to Turley

Solomons admitted he was not thinking of offering Turley a pro contract at this stage, even if he did well against Leinster, as he had not seen enough of him play.

‘We have five injured locks, with Ollie Atkins failing a fitness test on Wednesday, so we really don’t have anywhere else to go but Jack,’ said the Edinburgh boss. ‘I saw him play against Gala and he had a reasonable game there and then on the Monday night I thought he played pretty well for the Edinburgh A team against Ontario Blues.

‘He had a bit of an instructive morning with me on Thursday, going through the attack stuff, and going through the defence stuff with (assistant coach) Omar Mouneimne.

‘He’s an intelligent guy but this will be a test for him, especially coping with the physical level of the pro game.

‘There should be no expectation on him. He’s just got to go out there, give it a crack and see what happens.’
