For some couples a simple weekend away is enough to make them feel they’ve got out of the house and experienced something special. Not for the Skinners, though.

Husband and wife team Andy and Sarah Skinner have spent the past 10 years travelling the world together to remote locations as they photograph wild animals in their most intimate moments.

The couple from Berkshire have captured some of the most dangerous beasts on our planet going about their daily business in this stunning collection of wildlife images.

Andy and Sarah regularly swap their ordinary day jobs for life on the edge - and have notched up more than 50 excursions to destinations including Africa, India, North America and the Arctic.

Sarah, 40, says it’s a far cry from her day job as a bathroom supplies account manager or Andy’s as a heating and plumbing engineer.

'It's exhilarating, it's challenging. There's nothing better than sitting under the stars and listening to lions roaring.

'It's so different to what we do. It's a release going into the wild and we really do live two different lives.

The fearless couple leave no stone unturned when it comes to getting the perfect picture, and have converted a Land Rover into a specialist safari vehicle. 

Look at our teeth ... Sarah and Andy have been married for 13 years and been on over 50 exotic overseas excursions together

Andy, 40, explains the moment their operation went up a notch.

'We were sitting around a camp fire in Kenya one night and then we decided to ship our own vehicle over,’ he says.

'We bought the car here and completely stripped it down and changed the chassis and the gear box and prepared it for an African adventure.

'It has a fridge, a cooker and a roof tent. We got it on a container and took it to Mombasa. It's kept there and we use it for all our photography.

'The vehicle is just how we want it so we have photo mounts and we can focus on different species.'

With their customised equipment they have no problem getting up close to lions, tigers, bears and giraffes in their natural environment - capturing them as they eat, sleep, fight, bond and play.

'We've got a good understanding so we never feel in danger,' said Sarah.

'There can be hairy moments but Andy is very capable so I'm always confident that I have got a man that can get us out.

'Last year, we were sat by a fire in Botswana and we turned around to see a large female hyena stood just a couple of feet away from us.

'We've had all the big animals come into camp and get really close. Many times we wake up to buffalo or elephants.

'They usually just nonchalantly pass by and generally avoid us. One particular morning we awoke in camp to a buffalo sitting at the base of the ladder to our roof tent.

'Seemed he just wanted a bit of company and security! So, most of the time it's really exciting.'

Andy and Sarah have been married for 13 years after meeting in less than conventional circumstances. 

'I saw Andy hanging from a tree because he used to be an arborist,’ Sarah says. ‘Eventually we got together. We both had a real love for wildlife before that.

‘I dragged him to Africa in 2004 and that was the point that we both got hooked.’

The pair have since been to that continent more than 40 times.

‘We thought we would probably do it once but we both got bitten by the bug. 

'We got more and more into it and then we weren't satisfied with guided tours so that's when we started self-driving in Kenya.’

Andy adds: 'Both of us love being immersed in natural environment surrounded by wildlife.

‘Every single picture brings with it a memory, and it's great that we can look back and have such fantastic memories.

'Some of our adventures aren't for the feint-hearted and I would not recommend people just go driving around Africa.'
