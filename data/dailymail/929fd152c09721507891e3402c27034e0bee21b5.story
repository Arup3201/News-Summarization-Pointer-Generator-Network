Like many other young girls, Leezan Salam, 17, dreams of becoming a ballerina and of taking to the stage at the Royal Opera House one day.

But achieving her dream won't be easy for Leezan lives in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad; a place where, since the start of the year, more than 2,000 people have been killed in car bomb attacks and religious extremists consider dancing sinful.

Despite the risks, she continues to attend the Baghdad Music and Ballet School, the only place in Iraq that teaches classical music and dance.

High hopes: Leezan Salam, 17,Â  is desperate to pursue her dreams of becoming a professional ballerina

'When you enter school, you enter a 
place of hope and peace,' says the teenager who has been a pupil at the school for 10 years.

'It's totally different from out there. Outside 
you hear car bombs and gunfire. Inside the school, everything is 
beautiful.'

But her dreams of a career in dance means overcoming fierce opposition from religious extremists who believe both ballet and music to be against the teachings of Islam.

As a result, the school is forced to employ four heavily armed security guards for fear of being attacked.

'Ballet is prohibited and considered 
infidel,' explains Wassan Jassim, one of the last two ballet teachers in Iraq.

Dangerous: Like others in Baghdad, Leezan faces sectarian violence each day - 200 are killed every week

Terrifying: The aftermath of a bomb attack in Baghdad. Most are planted by Sunni or Shia militiamen

'We have no support or protection and therefore, we avoid 
performing. It's very painful. I can't arrange a ballet performance. I 
can't say I'm a ballet teacher. It's very difficult to leave work 
knowing that it might be blown up.'

Equally deadly are the daily car bombings, most the result of intensifying violence between Sunni and Shia Muslims.

So bad has the violence become, parts of the city have become no-go areas, while huge walls, ostensibly for protection, separate the Sunni minority from the rest of the city.

And the students at the Baghdad Ballet and Music School aren't immune. On 13th January 2014, one of Leezan's friends, a boy named Ali Nouri, was killed by a bomb.

Ali, a Shia, would join Leezan, a Sunni, after school each day as she waited for her father to arrive and pick her up.

Tragedy: Leezan's friend Ali Nouri died when a bomb went off on his bus. He had to be identified by his clothes

But one day, that changed. 'He asked me, "Should I wait with you until
 your lift comes?",' remembers Leezan. 'I said, "Go now before it gets dark".

Minutes later, Leezan had a call from her mother. 'My mum called 
and said, "Ali has been injured". I called Ali's phone and a stranger 
answered. He said, "Call this boy's family and tell them he's been 
killed".

The bus Ali was in had been attacked by a suicide bomber. His body was so badly damaged, he had to be identified using his ID, mobile phone and clothes.

'I pray for the girls every day,' confesses Leezan's Kurdish mother. 'Once 
they'd catch the bus but now it's not safe. The road, the car, even the 
school is not safe. Still, I believe God will keep themselves.'

Despite the dangers, Leezan refuses to give up her studies at ballet school - despite the presence of a conventional school much closer to home.

'There is a school closer to home, yes,' she admits. 'I prefer to go through the dangers for my reasons, for my ballet.'

Brave: Leezan says she plans to continue her ballet training and hopes, if nothing else, to become a teacher

Angry: Teacher Wassan says she is terrified leaving school in case she returns to find it has been bombed

But with just 10 months to go before she is due to graduate from the school, she is faced with some tough decisions.

Should she follow the example of 40 per cent of Iraq's musicians and dancers and leave the country? Or attempt to dance for a living at home?

'Of course I will always dream of becoming famous around all the Arab countries, Europe, America. If I stay in Baghdad, I will not gain any experience. I will not learn anything new. I will only grow within my own expertise.

''If I stay, I hope I could become a ballet teacher,' she says. 'Clearly I could train others and perform ballet at cultural events. After that, we'll see what happens.'

Teacher Wassan is unconvinced. 'Graduating is it for her in ballet unless she 
travels abroad,' she says.

'If she found somebody to sponsor her at the school, she 
could continue as a ballet teacher. Even that's a small possibility.'

High hopes: Despite the challenges, Leezan hopes to one day take to the stage at the Royal Opera House

Angrily, she adds: 'Killing,
 claiming that this is prohibited, that all your work is prohibited... 
Before it was the opposite, it was different. Art was respected, 
especially ballet. Not anymore.'

Whether Leezan chooses to go abroad or not, one thing is certain: She will continue to dance whatever happens in Iraq.

'I want to dance,' she says. 'This is a natural act. There must be room for art and dancing. Maybe then, their [the extremists] mindset will change.

'If
 I have to quit ballet, I will change my nationality, even if it makes me 
very depressed. I will not stop dancing until I'm old.'
