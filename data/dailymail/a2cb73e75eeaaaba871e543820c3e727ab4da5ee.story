Shakhtar Donetsk trio Dentinho, Alex Teixeria and Douglas Costa have admitted they are afraid to return to Ukraine while the country is engulfed in conflict.

Dentinho, Alex Teixeria and Douglas Costa were among six players who remained in France following a friendly against Lyon on Saturday.

And the trio have released statements insisting they are not trying to engineer a move away from the club.

Dentinho said: ‘We want to clarify that we have no problem with the club. In previous seasons, we have strictly complied with the dates agreed with the coaches.

'But this time, in a meeting at the hotel, together with all Brazilian players after the match against Lyon, because of the conflicts in the country, we are scared and do not want to endanger the lives of our family.

‘It’s an individual decision. As head of the family, I think about my wife and kids and no money in the world will risk their lives. I just want you to understand that the club want to work, want to play, but I can not allow people that I love so much to be endangered.

'I want to play but can not allow people who I love to be endangered. We have read that the embassies of the United States, England, Switzerland and also in Brazil has recommended that people do not travel to the region. The question I ask is: Would you send your child there at the moment?’

Earlier on Monday, Shakhtar’s owner said the players will be punished financially if they fail to return.

‘If they don’t come then in the first instance they will suffer,’ the club’s billionaire owner Rinat Akhmetov said in a statement on the Shakhtar website.

Refusing to fulfil their contracts could cost the players ‘tens of millions of euros’ in compensation payments to the club, he warned.

‘I don’t rule out that these players will return to the club soon,’ Akhmetov said, adding that several of them could arrive Monday and that the club would not seek to sell them.

But Teixeria said his main priority was the safety of his family.

He said: ‘Right now, the biggest concern we have is with the safety of us and our families. We respect the decision of those who have decided to play in Ukraine with the club. I have a wife and daughter, they are my priority. 

'We know that the airport and the airspace in Donetsk is closed. We gave the suggestion that we train outside the country until everything calms down, The first offer the club gave us was living in Kharkov but a few hours later we were told that the decision was to move to Kiev.

'It showed a lot of uncertainty with the planning. Where would be our families and our children go?’

The Ukrainian military is attempting to retake the city of Donetsk in the east of the country, which is controlled by pro-Russian rebels.

Akhmetov is Ukraine’s richest man and a leading power-broker in the east of the country, where his companies employ hundreds of thousands of people.

He has publicly opposed the rebels and earlier this month pleaded with Ukrainian forces not to bomb Donetsk.

The Ukrainian Football Federation has yet to rule where Shakhtar will play their home games while the conflict rages.

Akhmetov has expressed a preference for the mostly Russian-speaking city of Kharkiv in the north-east.

‘We aren’t going to take risks and in no way will we take players to somewhere that is dangerous,’ Akhmetov said.

Attacking midfielder Douglas Costa added: ‘I want to clarify that I am not abandoning the club. I’m afraid. Everything we read, see or hear about the situation in the country is quite complicated. We do not know under what conditions we can train much less where to play.

'I have no problem at Shakhtar, but we must understand that there is a serious situation. I’m afraid that other conflict situations will happen and we will be separated from our families.

'I regret that all this is happening. But this time, we all run the risk of life if we are in the region. We talked with the club and we proposed to remain in Switzerland to train until the situation is resolved. We want to stay at the club.’

Shakhtar’s first game of the season is the Ukrainian Super Cup against Dynamo Kiev, which will be played in the western city of Lviv.
