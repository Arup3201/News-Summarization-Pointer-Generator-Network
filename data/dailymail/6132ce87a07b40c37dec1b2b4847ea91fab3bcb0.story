A 51-year-old man allegedly forced an intoxicated 18-year-old woman to have sex with him after he told her he wouldn't kill her it she would 'go with it'.

The teenager, who cannot be named, had been out with friends at a bar on Oxford Street in August 2013, and after leaving in a taxi with an unnamed man, was left lying on the side of street after she was sick in the vehicle.

It is alleged that Joseph Stephen Rosenburg came up to her and put his hand up her dress, and followed her into Hyde Park where she went in an attempt to escape him.

A Sydney court has heard that a 51-year-old man forced a teenager to have anal sex in Hyde Park

The 18-year-old lay down near a tree, suffering the effects of excessive alcohol, and was followed by Rosenburg who allegedly came up to her and began touching her. 

'Are you going to kill me?' she allegedly asked him.

'No, I'm not going to kill you if you go with it,' he allegedly replied.

Crown prosecutor Craig Patrick told Sydney's District Court on Tuesday that Rosenburg forced the teenager to perform oral and anal sex while she pleaded with him to stop.

She allegedly sent her friends a series of illegible texts to her friends pleading for help, including 'I'm being tapes (sic), help'.

Afterwards, the teenager called a friend to come pick her up, saying 'he has hurt me, he has hurt me. He raped me, he raped me'.

The court heard the teenager had consumed excessive amounts of vodka after being sick in a taxi

Rosenburg was arrested in March 2014 with his DNA matching forensic samples found on her underwear, the court heard.

Rosenburg's barrister Ken Averre said it wasn't disputed his client had oral sex with the teenager, but that the question of consent was in question.

Mr Averre said that Rosenburg denied having anal sex with the 18-year-old.

He now faces three counts of sexual intercourse without consent and three charges of indecent assault. 

The court heard that the teenager had left the club she was at with her friends in order to drink large amounts of vodka before returning heavily affected by alcohol. 

The trial continues.
