A family's Christmas presents have been destroyed and their house devastated after an e-cigarette which was plugged into the wrong charger exploded and set fire to their home.

Terry Skinner, 25, placed his device on to charge in an upstairs bedroom in his home in Sheerness, Kent, before heading downstairs to join fiancee Tara Austin, 22, in the living room. 

Barely ten minutes later the internal battery had exploded and a fire began to tear through the room at their home - just yards away from where his children were sleeping.

A family's Christmas presents have been destroyed after an e-cigarette exploded and set fire to their home after it was plugged into the wall with the wrong charger

The internal battery exploded and a fire began to tear through the room at Terry Skinner's home - just yards away from where his children were sleeping

The fire destroyed 80 per cent of the room, ripping through the family's clothes and destroying a host of Christmas presents. 

He said: 'I'd put my kids to bed and put the e-cigarette on charge. About five minutes later I heard a bang, I just assumed it was our neighbours moving things about.

'I heard another bang so went upstairs and opened our bedroom door to find the blaze.

'It came as a bit of a surprise. My main concern was making sure my kids were safe.'

Mr Skinner has thanked his local community for donating clothing and presents to help bring his children some joy during the festive period.

Mr Skinner, 25, had placed his device on to charge in an upstairs bedroom in his home in Sheerness, Kent, before heading to downstairs to join fiancee Tara Austin, 22, in the living room

He said: 'My niece and mother-in-law put something on Facebook and the response we have got is unbelievable.

'I just want to let them know how grateful and thankful we are. Words can't describe. There are a lot more kindhearted people out there than you think.

'It's just one of those shocking things that you don't realise is going to happen to you.'

Kent Fire Rescue Service Watch Manager Andy Bridger-Smart said: 'When we arrived we were faced with a fire well alight in the front bedroom.

'The fire caused 80 per cent damage to the room; the rest of the upstairs has extensive smoke damage.'

Kent Fire and Rescue Service has urged people who use e-cigarettes to make sure they follow the manufacturer's guidelines when it comes to charging them.

Recent national figures show e-cigarettes fires have increased over the last two years as the smoking devices gain popularity.

In 2012, there were just eight emergency service call-outs to e-cigarette fires but the figure rose to 43 last year and there have been at least 62 so far in 2014.
