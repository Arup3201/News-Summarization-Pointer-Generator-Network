Police investigating the balcony fall death of New Zealand tourist Warriena Wright are reportedly drawing comparisons from a 1986 murder case where a woman plunged from a sixth floor window after her boyfriend attacked her.

Goldcoast bodybuilder Gable Tostee was arrested on Friday and charged with Ms Wright's murder after she fell from the 14th-floor balcony of his apartment after they reportedly met on mobile dating app Tinder.

The 28-year-old has maintained he is innocent and intends to plead not guilty, his lawyer has said.

Police are looking at the Sydney case of Kim William Royall, who was found guilty of girlfriend Kelly Healey's murder because she fell while trying to escape his violent clutches, for clues in Tostee's case, the Courier Mail reports.

This weekend, The Sunday Mail claimed evidence has emerged which shows Ms Wright was desperately trying to escape from Tostee's apartment just moments before plunging to her death.

The 26-year-old Kiwi tourist's final words were allegedly: 'No, no, no â€¦ I just want to go home.'

Audio recordings from mobile phones found in a car in the building's basement are believed to be the lead detectives were looking for to arrest Tostee on Friday.

Police will allege Ms Wright and Tostee first met in person at Cavill Mall about 9pm on August 7.

Witnesses claim they heard a woman screaming 'I just want to go home' early on Friday August 8.

Tostee hid in the building's foyer as police arrived at his apartment, CCTV footage obtained by police reportedly shows.

His lawyer, Michael Purcell, says Tostee maintains he is not guilty of the murder and will be applying for bail.

'My client maintains his innocence and we look forward to the provision of a brief of evidence so we can move on with the court process,' he said.

The 26-year-old Kiwi tourist's final words were allegedly: 'NO, no, no ... I just want to go home,'

'I've got instructions to make an application to the Supreme Court for bail in the weeks to come.'

Gold Coast regional crime squad commander, Detective Superintendent Dave Hutchinson, said there were two people in the apartment prior to Ms Wright's fall - 'Mr Tostee and Warriena'.

Ms Wright, a New Zealand bank worker, was near the end of a two-week trip to the Gold Coast for a friend's wedding when she met her fate.

Tostee has been remanded in custody until October 10 for the murder of Ms Wright.

He did not appear in Southport Magistrates Court on Saturday morning - the day after he was charged with the murder of Ms Wright - and Magistrate John Costanzo adjourned Tostee's matter until October 10.

Tostee's family were also not present in court on Saturday.

In the week leading up to Tostee's arrest, detectives kept his flat as a crime scene during the week while they made extensive forensic examinations of the unit.

On Wednesday, police in a cherry picker were raised up the Avalon building to take forensic samples from the outside of the balcony and other apartments on the way down.

Days later, detectives arrested Tostee at his parents' Carrara home on the Gold Coast and took him to the Southport watchhouse, where he charged with the murder of Ms Wright - exactly a week after she plummeted to her death.
