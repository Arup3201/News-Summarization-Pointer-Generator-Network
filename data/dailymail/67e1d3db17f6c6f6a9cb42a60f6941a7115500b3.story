A home in an elegant north Detroit neighborhood just sold to an anonymous buyer for a cool $1.6million in cash, one of the city's biggest home sales of recent years, according to the Detroit Free Press.

The Alfred J. Fisher mansion is listed at 16,466 square feet, making it the second-largest residence in historic Palmer Woods, a neighborhood that was once home to several auto industry titans.

With Detroit's economy cratering and the housing market down the tubes, there's no shortage of homes on the market, but few are as beautiful as the Fisher mansion or able to command a price tag north of one million.

Real estate: In what is being called the biggest sale of recent years, the Albert J Fisher mansion was sold for $1.6million

Sumptuous: Original details in the mansion were preserved or restored, including the hand-crafted features on the ceiling of the dining room

Record-breaking: The anonymous buyer looked past the clutter of a recent estate sale at the hand-crafted features of the mansion's interior

Alfred J. Fisher had the house built in 1926. Fisher built his fortune, along with his brothers, through the family's horse-carriage company, Fisher Body, which later was bought by General Motors.

According to a website for the home, the previous owners worked to preserve the home and only restored areas when needed, taking care with the 'hand-painted walls and ceilings' in the library, breakfast room and sunroom.

In addition to 15 bedrooms, the mansion features 17 bathrooms, an indoor pool and a ballroom.

Mod mansion: The previous owners updated appliances, adding a wine cooler and other modern features to the kitchen

Restoration: Where they could, the previous owners restored or preserved original tile work, to keep the mansion as close as possible to its original state

Luxurious: The design of the rooms reflect the tastes of the period it was designed in

There are also two acres of manicured grounds outdoors that will delight the new owner.

The new owner will be able to entertain guests in the dining room, where the previous owners kept the original 'gilding.'

They will also be able to do whatever it is one does in a 'morning room,' where the 'poly-chroming' was preserved.

Life of leisure: The owner and their guests can take a dip in the pool or walk the two acres of manicured grounds at the mansion

Cushy: The home was one of many that the Fisher family had built after making their fortune in the carriage and later the auto industries

The buyer won't have to deal with antique amenities everywhere in the house, as the kitchen was overhauled and appliances were all replaced while keeping the original tiling on the walls and ceilings.

The Fisher family sold the house to the University of Detroit Mercy in 1968, which then sold it off to a private buyer.
