Sportsmail columnists Jamie Redknapp, Jamie Carragher, Martin Keown and Bryan Robson give their expert opinion on the upcoming Premier League season.

Jose Mourinho might want to read all the way to the bottom... 

Which game is the golden ticket?

Carragher: In terms of teams challenging for the top and the timing of it, Liverpool going to Stamford Bridge with three games to go looks the best game. It was pivotal last year and may prove to be again.

Redknapp: Liverpool v Manchester United, especially with Louis van Gaal adding more stardust. You can’t beat the animosity between the clubs and the great players. United will be desperate for revenge after losing twice last season.

Revenge mission: Wayne Rooney and Manchester United lost twice to Steven Gerrard's Liverpool last season

Keown: The Manchester derbies. Can City can permanently wrestle away United’s dominance and finish ahead of them two years in a row?

Robson: Manchester City against Chelsea at the end of September could be a spicy, attacking game which will be an indicator of where the title goes.

Which manager would you have liked to play for?

Robson: Arsene Wenger. His philosophy is admirable. It would have been interesting to play in one of his sides, although I might have had my work cut out defending.

Keown: Roberto Martinez. He’s one of the few Premier League managers I saw at the World Cup, which suggests he is a real student of the game. I want to find out what his training methods are and how he has managed to improve Everton so much.

Redknapp: This is hard! The best manager I played for was my dad, Harry. I’m a huge admirer of Brendan Rodgers and I’d love to soak up Wenger’s experience. And now there is Van Gaal! But, despite letting himself down at times last season, I’d pick Mourinho. He’ll be the man lifting the trophy at the end of the season.

Carragher: I’d pick Mourinho, too. He is a proven winner, there’s almost a guarantee of trophies and most players speak highly of him.

Who can dethrone Manchester City?

Redknapp: I expected City to kick on in the summer but I still feel they’re short in defence and need to tie up the signing of Eliaquim Mangala. Chelsea should have won the title last season and now with Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas, there are no excuses. I think they will win it.

Carragher: I see City and Chelsea as the two front runners with Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United chasing them. But I’m backing Chelsea to finish top.

Robson: Arsenal have bought interesting players but Chelsea will be strong and I’d say it is between them and Manchester United. That may surprise some but being out of Europe could really help United.

Keown: City will win it again. They have the stability. I was never able to defend the title — it is very hard — but they have the best squad with the best balance.

In with a shout: Jose Mourinho's Chelsea are the favourites to overhaul Manchester City

Who’s the best signing?

Keown: Alexis Sanchez — I’m being biased here! He was outstanding during the World Cup. He has such tenacity and his work rate is infectious.

Carragher: Who knows yet? But Chelsea’s three big signings — Diego Costa, Cesc Fabregas and Filipe Luis — look impressive as a package on paper.

Redknapp: Lazar Markovic looks good at Liverpool. I watched him for Benfica last season and he reminded me a bit of Patrik Berger in the way he ghosted past people. It is effortless for him and the winger is happy to have the ball in tight areas.

Robson: I really like Sanchez. He has great pace and can score both simple and spectacular goals. United wanted him a few years ago.

The new faces: Alexis Sanchez (left) and Lazar Markovic will both be exciting additions

Which player would you buy who hasn’t moved yet?

Robson: Everton’s Ross Barkley. He would really suit United and has all the attributes to be a top player: physique, touch, vision, confidence.

Redknapp: I want to see the next best young player and wish it could have been James Rodriguez. I’d go for Radamel Falcao. He’d fit in perfectly at Liverpool or Arsenal.

Keown: Eduardo Vargas, who played up front alongside Sanchez for Chile at the World Cup. Another tireless worker with electric pace.

Carragher: Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba looks ideally suited to the Premier League. He would be expensive, but I would love to see another midfield powerhouse in our league.

Can Van Gaal take United from seventh to first?

Carragher: He will give them the belief that they can challenge straight away. Yes, he will demand a lot as he’s a winner but you can already see the benefits. But I can’t see the title going to Old Trafford unless they add more top players.

Robson: I disagree. He can win it. I was really impressed by him while on United’s US tour. His organisation is excellent and no detail is left to chance. It’s also good to see Ryan Giggs involved as it will be an excellent learning curve for him should he eventually take over.

Redknapp: We are so narrow-minded in this country and now he’s going to play 3-5-2. It’s a great system but people look at him like he’s from the moon. All of a sudden others will copy him. I don’t think United will win the league because they’ve lost Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic and are a few players short. Top four would be a great season.

Keown: He’ll bring organisation and structure and can restore belief at the club. Their home record melted away last season and he needs to re-establish it. He can make the top four and have a cup run.

Restoring former glories: Louis van Gaal will aim to take Manchester United from seventh back to the top

Who will surprise us?

Redknapp: Everyone is tipping Southampton for a relegation battle but I think they will be solid. Yes, they’ve sold so many stars but there are always talented young players coming through.

Keown: Tottenham. They have an outstanding manager in Mauricio Pochettino, who has a very clear way of playing. Their full backs will attack and there will be good movement.

Carragher: I agree. Spurs have not bought many players yet but I rate Pochettino and expect a strong challenge for fourth place. They have a squad full of talent.

Robson: Hull City could do well. Spurs also have a good squad.

Outstanding: Mauricio Pochettino can spring a surprise at Tottenham because of his style of play

Can Liverpool be a force without Luis Suarez?

Keown: You can’t lose a player of that quality and be a better team. They need to sign another striker. There’s a lot of pressure on Brendan Rodgers to prove the last campaign was not a one-season wonder.

Carragher: They can’t replace Suarez and it is evident that when Sturridge gets injured, they will need more firepower. Buying so many players means that one or two will fail to live up to their price tag . The majority of Rodgers’ first-choice XI will be from last season’s team.

Robson: They’ve bought some interesting players but Suarez was special — even though it was right to sell him. The demands of the Champions League will make it difficult for Liverpool to replicate their league form of last season.

Redknapp: To lose your superstar is so tough. Maybe they should have bought a big-name striker like Falcao as a direct replacement. I worry there is so much pressure on Rickie Lambert. The expectation is very different from at Southampton — I know that having played for both teams.

Pressure: Rickie Lambert will attempt to fill the gap left by Luis Suarez (right)

Do you have a message for any one player?

Redknapp: Wayne Rooney. He has the chance to be captain for club and country. England captains are like royalty in this country so he needs to behave himself and score goals. Enjoy it, embrace it, you’re not a kid any more.

Carragher: Jack Wilshere’s problem is not smoking or other behaviour off the pitch, it’s getting in the team ahead of Aaron Ramsey. Wilshere needs the kind of season Ramsey had last year and to become a leader.

Keown: Chris Smalling and Phil Jones have a huge opportunity to finally kick on with Vidic and Ferdinand gone. They need to prove they have futures with United and England. Van Gaal can make them better players. Are they any worse than Holland’s centre halves? No.

Robson: I’d tell Fernando Torres to play with confidence. It’s such a shame to see because he looks like he is a lad who wants to do well.

Play with confidence: Fernando Torres looks as if he still wants to do well but it isn't happening

So, then where should we be putting our money?

Keown: Man City.

Robson: Chelsea

Carragher: Chelsea

Redknapp: Chelsea.
