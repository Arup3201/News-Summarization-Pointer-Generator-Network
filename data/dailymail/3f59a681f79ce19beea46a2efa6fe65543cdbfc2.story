Raynor Manalad was a recent nursing graduate destined for a life spent helping others.

But at just 21, his hopes of making people's lives a better one were dashed when his own was cut short by a single punch to the face on Saturday morning.

Mr Manalad, who graduated from the Australian Catholic University, was celebrating a friend's 21st birthday party when he was king-hit shortly after midnight.

Tragic: Raynor Manalad was at a house party celebrating a 21st birthday party when he was hit by a punch to the face shortly after midnight on Saturday

He was rushed to Westmead Hospital about 12.30am Saturday morning but died 6pm the following day.

Police have said he was killed while trying to quell a fight between his alleged attacker, Hugh Garth, and his girlfriend.

Garth, 21, stands accused of striking Mr Manalad and his of charge of causing grievous bodily harm with intent, common assault and affray is expected to upgraded when he appears at Blacktown Local Court tomorrow.

A photo of a bottle of Southern Comfort posted to Garth's Facebook hours after the attack could provide a crucial bit of evidence as to whether he was drinking that night.

Meanwhile, Saturday's fatal attack is the third of its kind to claim a young life in Sydney since 18-year-old Thomas Kelly and Daniel Christie died on the streets of Kings Cross in July 2012.

And like both of them, it appears Mr Manalad was yet another innocent victim.

Friends and family have called for justice on Facebook declaring his death is yet another senseless act of violence.

'RIP Ray brother. Didn't know you well enough but through everything I've seen and heard the past few days you were loved by all. Heart goes out to all the family and loved ones. Rest well bro,'Â  Jeremy Nool posted to Facebook.

Tony Xuan Nguyen said Raynor's last moments alive typified the kind of person he was.

'You can see the type of person Ray was, trying to break the fight up...' he said.

Pat Canavan agreed, along with others who have started the online rally #justiceforray.

'Well said bro,' Mr Canavan wrote.

'He didn't deserve anything like that. At all. RIP Ray.'

Another friend, Alyssa, described him as 'a beautiful sunset.'

'Hearing about your passing hits me like a ton of bricks. I cannot believe that you are gone. It hurts that you are no longer alive because you where the person who would always keep the peace in the group.'

The mother of the man accused of the killing is still in shock, first made aware of her son's arrest when approached by Channel Nine on Monday.

'I was watching 60 minutes, on the news Saturday, and that's when my heart was pumping,' she said.

She also said the severity of the situation was 'hard' for her to deal with.

Since the deaths of Thomas Kelly and Daniel Christie, both 18, and a number of other serious assaults on Sydney's streets, new laws have been introduced to help curb alcohol-fueled attacks.

The state government also introduced earlier lock-out and closing times for some of Sydney's busiest bars.

In similar circumstances to this latest death, Daniel Christie was walking along the same street as Thomas when he was attacked by 25-year-old Shaun McNeil on New Year's Eve.

Mr Christie had been in a critical condition for 11 days before his family made the decision to turn off his life support.

In December last year, Michael McEwen, 23, was attacked by up to three men at Bondi when he was punched to the ground and allegedly stomped on.

All these incidences were the catalyst for new mandatory minimum sentencing laws imposed against people who commit such crimes.

It was announced that anyone convicted of reckless grievous bodily harm or wounding a member of the public or a police officer while intoxicated can expect a minimum sentence of three to five years and a maximum penalty of up to 16 years.

Former premier Barry O'Farrell said the new laws, which included a curfew on trading hours to 3am across the city, sent out 'the possible strongest message' that drug and alcohol-fuelled violence will no longer be tolerated.
