A row involving some of the most senior legal figures in the country erupted yesterday over accusations that a judge was removed from a trial of journalists to ‘improve the prospect of conviction’.

Lawyers representing four Sun journalists accused of illegally paying public officials for stories claimed ‘something funny had been going on behind the scenes’ after a judge who heard their first trial – which ended with a hung jury – was suddenly removed.

Judge Richard Marks QC emailed defence barristers following the move saying: ‘It has been decided (not by me but by my elders and betters) that I am not going to be doing the retrial.’ Nigel Rumfitt, QC, speaking on behalf of the accused, demanded an explanation yesterday, saying the secretive ‘backstage manoeuvre’ was highly unusual and unfair.

But one of the UK’s top judges, Mr Justice Sweeney, reacted with fury to the suggestion that Judge Marks had been replaced by Judge Charles Wide QC simply to secure more convictions in a retrial. Judge Wide is the only judge to have presided over a trial where there has been a successful conviction of a journalist over unlawful payments to public officials for stories, after a succession of similar cases have ended in acquittals.

Mr Rumfitt told the Old Bailey yesterday that time and money would be saved if Judge Marks continued to handle the case.

But Mr Justice Sweeney blasted his submission as ‘absurd’. Raising his voice, he thundered: ‘It might be thought to be a sad day when it is suggested that... a fair minded and informed observer would conclude that there was a real possibility that a judge exercising a judicial function had deliberately taken or approved an administrative decision to inappropriately favour one side over the other in litigation of any type.

Judge Charles Wide, pictured, will handle the retrial which is expected to start at Kingston Crown Court on September 21. 

‘I wish to state, emphatically, that Judge Wide was not chosen, or approved, because of his view to date (on a critical legal issue in the case). Nor was he chosen, or approved, in order to improve the prospects of conviction of these defendants.

‘In any event, the suggestion made is absurd. This is simply the replacement, for good reason as one would surely expect, of one fair judge by another fair judge.’

Mr Justice Sweeney went on to say Judge Marks’s email had been ‘significantly misconstrued’, adding that his words were meant to be ‘light hearted’.

He also rejected suggestions that the decision was made in secret, saying Judge Wide was been appointed in an ‘administrative judicial decision’ because Judge Marks was already committed to several trials this year.

The Sun’s head of news Chris Pharo, former managing editor Graham Dudman, reporter Jamie Pyatt and former deputy news editor Ben O’Driscoll all deny unlawful payments to public officials for stories. Last month a jury failed to reach a verdict on the majority of the charges. Judge Marks ordered a retrial and told the court the case would be scheduled at Kingston Crown Court on September 21 and it would be preferable if I was to deal with it’.

When he was removed defence barristers objected, pointing out that Judge Marks had made a ruling on a key element on the charges, while the new judge had taken a different view in a case with similar charges.

But Mr Justice Sweeney, who took responsibility for the switch as Lead Presiding Judge on the South Eastern Circuit, said the legal issue would be settled by the Court of Appeal.
