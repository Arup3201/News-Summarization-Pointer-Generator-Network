A series of moving portraits show both sides of living with disabilities in India.  

British photographer Graeme Robertson travelled to Rajasthan with Sightsavers, a charity that helps visually impaired people to carry on with their lives as independently as possible.

He photographed several blind or partially-sighted people living in the Indian state for the Put Us in the Picture campaign - Sightsavers' policy campaign to influence the UK Government's foreign aid policy. 

The campaign wants to make people aware that although people with disabilities have the same needs and rights to health, education and employment as others, they are one of the most excluded groups in society, particularly in the poorest countries of the world.

A series of moving portraits show difficulty that people like Sankarlal (left) and Dallu (right) have with living with disabilities in India. The photos are part of Sightsavers charity's Put Us in the Picture campaign. It wants disabled people included in all UK international aid programmes 

They want the Department For International Development to make sure people with disabilities participate in, and benefit from, all international development programmes.

Some of the people that Graeme photographed have benefitted from one of the Sightsaver's inclusion projects. 

The projects help people to rebuild their lives in many ways, including giving advice on how to apply for loans and disability support from the government, training for work that doesn't require full sight and also general building of confidence.

But the campaign also covered the plight of those who have so far received no help and the heartbreaking isolation that this can cause, with people wholly dependent on the charity of families.

Read on to hear the stories of some of those who took part in the project. 

Shyam: 

Shyam, 36, has been visually impaired for the past 15 years.

He said: 'I wasn't born blind, but became blind later. The doctor said I have glaucoma and the cornea can't be repaired. I can see black, white, yellow. I can make out colours from a distance. I can see the moon but not the stars.'

He says he is treated with pity and contempt by other people, with many laughing if they see him stumble in the street. He adds that sometimes, 'people spread thorns on the street so it hurts more.'

He continues: 'In all families, even my own, people think you're useless. In society, if you have no money and no work you're considered a burden and people won't talk to you.' 

Shyam has dreams to start a business, get a small house and have a wife and family of his own but his poor eyesight is preventing that from happening. 

He said: 'In this village there is no opportunity. If I had money I would go to the city. I can do any job. I cook for myself and clean the house so why can't I work?

'I would like to have kids but the community doesn't believe in marriage if you're not working and earning.'

 

Sankarlal:  

Sankarlal's sight began to deteriorate in his early teens, as a result of cataracts in both eyes and by the time he was 14 he was completely blind, and treatment to fix the problem was unsuccessful. 

He married his now-wife Gomati and had three children, but was frustrated few job opportunities were available to him.

He said: 'I used to sit inside the house and my wife used to go to work and support me.'

Sankarlal's life changed when he joined a group funded by Sightsavers for people with disabilities

Their purpose is empowerment – informing people of their rights and supporting them to gain skills and employment. 

Sankarlal's sight began to deteriorate in his early teens, as a result of cataracts in both eyes and by the time he was 14 he was completely blind, and treatment to fix the problem was unsuccessful. An organisation funded by Sightsavers helped him to apply for a loan to start his own business 

The organisation helped him to apply for a loan to start his own business, which started off as a mobile shop on a bicycle. 

It then expanded to a building next to his house that sells larger products like vegetables and pulses and has a refrigerator for cold drinks.

He said: 'Now I earn myself. Before people thought I was unproductive, they pitied me, but now I stand on my own legs. 

'My family think I am one of them and can do what they do.'

 

Sankarlal:  

Sankarlal, a 60-year-old man from the Rajasthan district of Bikaner lost his sight in 1984 after someone threw acid into his face. 

He said: 'I have lived two lives. But it's okay, it happens. Many people are blind from birth. I could, at least, see for 30 years.'

Following the attack, his disability and appearance meant he was ashamed to leave the house. 

Sankarlal, a 60-year-old man from the Rajasthan district of Bikaner lost his sight in 1984 after someone threw acid into his face. Times were tough until they received support from a government self-employment scheme for people with disabilities, which allowed him and his family to open a shop in their home 

He used to tend buffalo, whose milk he would sell to a cooperative dairy, but had to give this up, so his son, Hansraj, supported the family by running a rented shop.

Times were tough until they received support from a government self-employment scheme for people with disabilities, which allowed them to open a shop in their home. 

Nowadays, the whole family – Sankarlal, his wife Chawlidevi, Hansraj and his wife, and their two children aged 10 and 12 – help to run the store. 

 

Anuradha:

Anuradha, who's now 32, was only one year old when she fell into a fire, badly burning her hands and face. 

For a few years she was unaware of having any disability, but when she started school she noticed people would stare at her and it affected her confidence. 

'I felt ugly,' she says. 'When people asked what happened I didn't know what to say.'

A few decades passed and Anuradha was still suffering from a lack of confidence. 

Anuradha, who's now 32, was only one year old when she fell into a fire, badly burning her hands and face. She saw an advert for a disabled people's organisation by chance and is now her division's leader 

She'd left her husband, and was trying to support her two children (son Raj, 10, and five-year-old daughter Mohita) by working as a teacher, but was barely getting by.  

She saw an advert by chance in a newspaper about a meeting of the local DPO (disabled people's organisation) and was curious to find out more.

When she attended, she met 'brothers and sisters, people like me,' and realised that, like them, she could do things for herself and others. 'I got to know I could get a pension and travel pass.'

From these small steps Anuradha's confidence grew and she now has a job as leader of the DPO.

 

Dallu: 

Dallu, who's 28, lost her sight after contracting smallpox at the age of seven. 

She lives with her father and other family members – because they worry about her getting hurt, she rarely goes out. 

She said: 'Because of my blindness, when I move around even inside the house sometimes I fall or hit the wall.' 

She now only goes out a couple of times a year.

Although she's married, Dallu doesn't see her husband.

Her mother used to look after her, but died two years ago.  She'd love to be able to do things for herself, like filling a bucket of water to take a shower, but says her family have to do it for her. 

She said: 'I can't do anything and I don't want to do anything. If you put the cot there and tell me to sit there I will do it. 

'I'd like to go out and be in the community but I just feel like it can't happen.'
