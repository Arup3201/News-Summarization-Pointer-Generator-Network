World Cup winner Lucio is tipping the Chelsea factor to help Brazil lift the trophy again on home soil this summer.

Lucio, part of the last Brazil side to be world champions in 2002, thinks Felipe Scolari has pulled off a masterstroke by including four of Jose Mourinho’s players last season in his squad – Ramires, David Luiz, Oscar and Willian.

The big defender says it is a big advantage because the weekly intensity of the Premier League will help them cope with the pressure of being tournament favourites.

‘Of course, the four of them are in the squad because of their quality as individuals. But I also believe the fact that they play together helps because they understand each other,’ said Lucio, who now plays his club football in Brazil for Palmeiras.

‘The Premier League is one of the hardest in the world with plenty of great teams like Manchester United, Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal.

‘It makes the games really hard and gives great credibility to those players, a great experience. I think being used to playing at that level is very important for a World Cup.

‘Chelsea is a great team and for me Oscar is the player who can make the difference in a match. He’s a very offensive player; fast, creative, skilful. He can make a difference for Brazil.’

Ironically, Chelsea have only two players in the England squad compared to their quartet of Brazilians – Frank Lampard and Gary Cahill. Luiz is officially a Chelsea player until the end of the month when the transfer window re-opens and he joins Paris St Germain.

Lucio’s World Cup-winning side included star names like Ronaldo, Ronaldinho, Rivaldo and Roberto Carlos.

He played for Bayer Leverkusen at the time – they had lost the Champions League final to Real Madrid just before  the World Cup – and cemented his reputation as the best centre-half in the world in Japan and Korea.

‘My favorite memory is from the final, when we beat Germany 2-0, to become champions. I was only 24 but knew it was such a great accomplishment, it would go down in history.

‘I believe this year, the advantage of playing at home will be decisive. Everything is going to be on our side, and the history of Brazil in the World Cup and the quality of our players will help a lot. Brazil has a great chance.

‘The current team has different qualities to my 2002 side even though it has the same manager, Scolari. It would be a hard match between the two – I think it would be a draw!

Lucio is still stopped every day in football-mad Brazil about his World Cup triumph.

‘It doesn’t happen to many players because the World Cup is only every four years, so people still congratulate me and ask what it was like.

‘They also ask me if Ronaldinho’s winning goal against England was intentional! It’s difficult to answer but Ronaldinho said after the game that he meant to go for goal because the goalkeeper (David Seaman) used to leave his position many times.'
