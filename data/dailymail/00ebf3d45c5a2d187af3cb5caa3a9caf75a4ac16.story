Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was relentlessly heckled over the Benghazi terrorist attack as she tried to deliver a speech at a New York university on Wednesday night.

Clinton was speaking at the University of Buffalo as part of the university's 'Distinguished Speakers Series' when a man in the crowd began screaming about the attack that left three people dead, including Libyan Ambassador Chris Stevens.

'Benghazi, Benghazi - you let them die,' the man screamed as Clinton continued to give her speech.

'You let them die': Clinton is confronted by a heckler during a speech in Buffalo on Wednesday

Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee in January, famously asking 'What difference does it make?' whether Benghazi was a terror attack or the result of a protest that spun out of control

After about 40 seconds of yelling Clinton appeared to acknowledge the screaming man.

'We
 have to be willing to come together as citizens to focus on the kind of
 future we want, which doesn’t include yelling. It includes sitting down
 and talking to one another,' she said sternly.

The crowd then erupted with applause.

The heckler isn't the only person who blames Clinton for the attack - the mother of one of the four Americans killed in the
 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya told CNN's Jake Tapper 
earlier this year that she also blames Clinton for her son's death.

Pat
 Smith's son, State Department Information Officer Sean Smith, was one 
of the four Americans who perished when Islamic terrorists destroyed the
 consulate compound on the eleventh anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in 
New York City and Northern Virginia.

'You blame Secretary of State Clinton?' Tapper asked Smith? 'Yes,' she replied.

'Why was there no security for him?' Smith asked. 'When they were supposed to have security and the security that they did have was called back. It just - things do not add up and I'm just told lies'

The US consulate compound in Benghazi was reduced to a burnt-out shell after armed terrorists attacked. Hillary Clinton and others in the Obama administration are under fire for failing to prevent the attack, and for covering up its causes

'Why did it happen? And she is in charge. Why couldn't she do something about it? I blame her.'

'That's
 her department,' she explained. 'She is supposed to be on top of it. 
Yet she claims she knows nothing. "It wasn't told to her." Well, who is 
running the place?'

Smith 
said the U.S. State Department has refused to give her details about how
 her son died, even insisting that she's not entitled to information 
because she's 'not part of the immediate family.'

'I still remember the labor pains,' she said.

'I
 got one telephone call from a clerk that was a couple days after it 
happened. He was reading to me from the time line, which I already had. 
And that was it.'

Three whistle-blowers testified in a 
House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing about 
what they saw and heard before, during and after the terror attack that 
killed Smith's son.

Smith alleged that the Obama administration has been engaged in a dishonest cover-up since the attack killed her son and three other Americans, including the ambassador to Libya, Chris Stevens.

'Why was there no security for him?' she asked. 'When they were supposed to have security and the security that they did have was called back. It just - things do not add up and I'm just told lies.'
