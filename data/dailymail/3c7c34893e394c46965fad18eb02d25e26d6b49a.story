Humans are often encouraged not to feed pigeons but this wallaby obviously didn't get the memo.

The caring marsupial was snapped offering up her lunch to an inquisitive looking feathery friend at Sydney's Featherdale Animal Park.

And as she held out her ice cream cone full of food, a cute little Joey peeked out from her mother's pouch.

The heart-warming scene was captured by 66-year-old photographer Ann Cameron, from Sydney, while on a family trip to the park.

'My granddaughter gave the wallaby the ice cream cone full of food, and the pigeon began eating,' said Ms Cameron.

'The wallaby put the cone down as if it was inviting the pigeon to have some.

'I love visiting the animal park and have often taken overseas visitors there as well.'

Ms Cameron has travelled and photographed wildlife across Europe and South Africa, but her favourite spot remains the animal park, which is only ten minutes away from her home.

'I always come back with so many photos which I look at on a regular basis and relive my wonderful experiences,' she said.

'When I take visitors to the animal park, they're always excited to see some of Australia's native animals up close.

'This is also why I love visiting South Africa. It is so amazing to see the animals roaming free in their natural habitat.'

Established on seven acres of land, Featherdale has evolved from a poultry farm to one of the leading privately owned wildlife parks in Australia.

Ms Cameron added: 'I love taking photos and it gives me great pleasure to know that people find my photos interesting and diverse.'
