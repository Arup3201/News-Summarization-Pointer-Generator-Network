The daughter of Kirsty Wark has told how her mother struggled with the guilt of being a working parent.

Caitlin Clements, 23, said the Newsnight presenter ‘put herself through the wringer’ whenever she missed her two children’s precious moments growing up.

And she revealed that her mother – who has spent the past 20 years commuting between Glasgow and London – often over-compensated for her absence by baking at the weekends.

The university student, however,  said she and her brother James, 21, never felt the ‘separation’ Miss Wark suffered as a result of working away, and were lucky to have a hands-on father in TV producer Alan Clements.

Opening up in an interview, Miss Clements said: ‘For some reason mum’s always struggled with guilt about working – the cooking and the baking is part of that. But she doesn’t have anything to feel guilty about. Dad was very hands-on when my brother James and I were growing up, so we got the best of both of them.’

She told how she enjoyed plenty of time with her father, saying: ‘On Friday nights we had a routine – we’d do a big Tesco shop, then we’d go swimming and, on the way home, we’d get pizza and watch Friends together.’

Miss Clements said her mother always rushed back home to Scotland for the weekends, adding: ‘Mum always put herself through the wringer.

‘She’d run for the train after filming Newsnight so she could be back in Glasgow for 7am on Saturday … I think Mum felt the separation more than we did. She’s always running about 100 miles per hour.’

Guilty conscience: Caitlin Clements, 23, admits her mother Kirsty Wark struggled with the guilt of working and missing family events

Miss Wark, 59, has previously described herself a ‘helicopter parent, always hovering’. She was pregnant with Caitlin when she famously interviewed Margaret Thatcher on BBC Scotland in 1990.

By the time her daughter was born, she was already working freelance and quickly went back to working part-time. She joined BBC2’s Newsnight in 1993, a year after her son James was born.

Yesterday Miss Clements told The Sunday Times Magazine how her mother would insist on home baking – recently going as far as arriving from the London to Edinburgh sleeper train with a homemade birthday cake.

Following in her mother’s footsteps, Miss Clements is studying journalism and writes a fashion column for a Scottish newspaper.
