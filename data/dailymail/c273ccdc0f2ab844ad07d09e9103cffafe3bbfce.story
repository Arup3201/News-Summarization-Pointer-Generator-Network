A couple who spotted a 'weather beaten man' at a remote creek in northern Queensland have contacted police saying they believe he may be missing Senior Sergeant Mick Isles, who disappeared in mysterious circumstances five years ago.

Graziers, Bill and Elizabeth Tudehope were on a remote road at Landers Creek on the Burdekin River near Millaroo last Sunday when they saw the man who was of the same age and height as the missing police officer, the Townsville Bulletin reported.

Sgt Isles has not been seen since September 23, 2009 after leaving his home in the far northern Queensland town of Ayr for a workshop 80km north in Townsville. He never arrived. 

Vanished: Senior Sergeant Mick Isles (pictured), 58, went missing in 2009 in strange circumstances and has never been found until now, when a north Queensland couple possibly sighted him at a remote creek

Six days later, his police issue Toyota Aurion was found at Eight Mile Creek, 170km south. The latest sighting of Sgt Isles is at a location between Ayr and Eight Mile Creek.

Following his disappearance, police conducted extensive searches for the 58-year-old, using trackers, the stock squad and the State Emergency Service.

Apart from one alleged sighting by a truck driver soon after his disappearance, Sgt Isles has never been seen again until now.

At the time of his disappearance, Sgt Isles was on only his third day back at work after a lengthy period of sick leave following a Crime and Misconduct Commission investigation which had exonerated him of drug trafficking and money laundering allegations.

His wife, Fiona, reported her husband's failure to return home after finding an an undated note on the last page of a used notebook.

The note read, 'This is nobody's fault but mine. I feel old and have lost the will to do anything. I feel a failure and a loser, particularly to my family whom I love so much'. The note was signed 'Mick + Dad'.

Northern Queensland police have sent a team of detectives to the Burdekin river area to interview the couple who made the report

A shot gun and ammunition were found to be missing from the Isle's family home.

Officers found a police uniform shirt  stuffed under the front passenger seat of Sgt isles' abandoned car and in the boot, along with a hessian bag, was a blanket and a box of ammunition that was missing 16 cartridges, a pair of uniform pants and a belt.

The car keys were on the front driver's side floor of the vehicle and a set of senior sergeant epaulettes had been placed in the centre drink console. 

At a 2012 inquest, Queensland State Coroner Michael Barnes found Senior Sergeant Michael Isles 'intentionally took his own life' on the day he was reported missing. Mr Barnes said: 'I sincerely regret the distress this will cause his family'.

The Townsville Bulletin reported that on Monday northern Queensland police have sent a team of detectives to the Burdekin river area to interview the couple who made the report.

Mr and Mrs Tudehope said they saw a man walking along a sugar cane train track mid-morning last Sunday and they asked him if he wanted a lift.

'He wasn’t interested in talking to me and didn’t want any help,' Mr Tudehope said.

They contacted Sgt isles son Steven, who travelled to the couples' property and the contacted police.
