A family of four had a lucky escape when they walked away from their car unscathed after a 60 foot tree fell on it.

Emily and Piers Tumeth were travelling along Brynmill Lane in Swansea in their Mazda car with their two daughters, Matilda, two, and seven-week-old Alice when a gust blew the tree on to their car.

Luckily, the tree also hit a small stone boundary wall, which stopped it from crushing them completely and the family were uninjured.

Fire crews had to close the road to remove the tree and broken wall after it almost crushed the Tumeth family car

Mr and Mrs Tumeth were taking their two young daughters and the family dog to the park at the time of the incident.

The couple described the incident as a ‘really lucky escape’. The road was closed until firefighters could clear the way. 

It was just one of several wind-related incidents across South Wales over the past few days as the area was hit with unseasonably strong gusts.

A female pedestrian and a shop manager were both struck when a shop sign came down in a crowded street in Penarth.

Fire crews made the scene safe and also called in a structural engineer from the Vale of Glamorgan Council.

A Welsh Ambulance Service spokeswoman said crews in a rapid response vehicle and two emergency ambulances attended.

‘One casualty was treated on scene and a second casualty was taken to the University Hospital of Wales with injuries that were not believed to be serious,’ she added.

Residents were also evacuated from a block of flats in Beddau, near Pontypridd, when a 30ft tree fell and ended in a precarious position, leaning against the property.
