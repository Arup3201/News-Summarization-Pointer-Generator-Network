A man dubbed the 'glam scammer' has been arrested in Louisiana in the midst of allegedly planning an elaborate Halloween party that would enable him to fleece locals out of thousands of dollars.

The man taken in by U.S. marshals was Michael Manos, 49, who is accused of leaving a trail of debt and despair in his wake right across the country.

According to police, his modus operandi involves arriving in town, turning up in all the right places and being flashy and ostentatious, before charming the locals with tales of celebrity and reality TV shows.

He then allegedly uses his new-found friends to provide donations and services for flashy fundraisers, pocketing the money and skipping town.

He has even duped actress Jane Fonda, who is pictured embracing the flamboyant con at a series of red carpet events, according to reports.Â 

The New Orleans Advocate reports that for his latest scam in New Orleans, Manos posed as Michael Morgan, a grandson of banking mogul J.P. Morgan.

To add authenticity, he engaged real estate agents to find him a local property for purchase for the sum of around $2 million.

He also held casting calls for a reality TV show he claimed would soon be shot about his life, called 'Bourbon Street,' with the tagline 'What happens in the street, stays in the street!'

Manos began planning a Halloween party in the town which, according to the Advocate, he billed as 'a magical night of giving and glamour at the Hottest Halloween Party New Orleans has ever seen.'

He solicited donations and local businesses pledged goods and services to the event, the proceeds of which Manos said would go to Covenant House, a charity that works with homeless children.

Tickets were snapped up for $125 a pop but Manos was arrested picking up the red carpet for the event.

According to the Dallas News, Manos was born to a middle-class family in Poughkeepsie, New York.

He suffered from dyslexia, hyperactivity and undiagnosed bipolar disorder as a child and grew into a troubled teen.

He dropped out of school, became a male prostiture and petty criminal and did his first stint behind bars in the late 1980s for kidnapping and theft for which he was put on lifetime parole, essentially banning him from leaving the state.

In photos snapped on the red carpet, his skin is smooth and tanned and his blond hair is carefully arranged to look artlessly tousled.

He looks startlingly different in his mugshot, from which the face of a tired, balding, middle-aged man stares, than when he's embodying his various personae.

Manos has so many aliases they are difficult to keep track of.

A 'Wanted' posted from New York, lists 10: Michael Anthony Martin, Brooke Carrington III, Alexis Vanderbilt, Dain Alexander Manos, Dain Alexander Vanderbilt, Michael Alexander, Martin Carrington, Michael Dain, Michael Vanderbilt and Mladen 'Mordan' Stefanov.

In Atlanta, Manos allegedly went by Christian Michael de Medici.

It was here he allegedly managed to take in Jane Fonda, 'donating' a house to her charity - which he didn't own.

The Dallas News reports that in Dallas, Texas, Manos was Mladen 'Mordan' Stefanov, a Greek heir who was developing a reality TV show called 'Bella Boyz.'

He fled Dallas in late-2009 but was tracked to San Francisco by a private investigator who had also been taken in by him.

When police arrested Manos in San Fracisco, he was in possession of $10,000 cash, 30 credit cards in fake names and a bogus Bulgarian driver's licence.

He eventually returned to Dallas, where he pleaded guilty to felony theft for the $87,000 in credit card charges.

He was released from jail in July 2011 and made his way to Washington DC to carry out another audacious scam.

Manos became Anthony Michael Manos in DC, a lobbyist and the star of a reality show called 'Two Gay Men,' about Manos and his dog Mimi.

Gawker reports that before he was caught there, he tried to throw a fundraiser for John McCain, who had never met Manos or agreed to the event.

That arrest led to his most recent jail stint. He was released in March and headed directly to New Orleans.

Manos was arrested on outstanding warrants in both Dallas and New York.

The Advocate reports that when he was arrested, Manos tried to explain to police his fears that the 'charity' gala wouldn't be able to go ahead without him.

Already invested, venue the Eiffel Society and local businessman Ryan Exsterstein managed to keep event afloat and on Thursday night, the party on St Charles Avenue went ahead.
