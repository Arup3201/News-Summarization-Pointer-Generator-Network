A former Marine who murdered his neighbour was twice turned away by police after handing himself in and confessing to the crime, a court heard.

Killer Thomas Puxty had to demand an interview after officers refused to believe him when walked into a police station to admit to brutally torturing and murdering his neighbour five years earlier, it was said.

Last year, Puxty, 31, was sentenced to life, with a minimum of 28 years, for the savage killing of Lee Clement at his home in Woolwich, south London, in March 2006.

However, the details of his confession have only just been heard during an appeal to reduce his sentence.

The judge ruled that his sentence should be cut by two years after hearing Puxty had ‘put himself behind bars'.

Kerim Fuad QC, defending, told the court: ‘The police thought he (Puxty) was wasting their time.

‘He was allowed to smoke outside for an hour or two before coming back inside but was sent away twice.

‘He could have walked away.

‘It was his sheer persistence in demanding an interview which led to him taking the police down to where he had buried Mr Clement some years earlier.’

Lord Justice Elias told the court that Puxty had ‘fallen into alcoholism’ because of his guilt.

The judge said: ‘The confession suggests an acceptance by the appellant of what he has done.

‘It demonstrates a wish to come to terms with his own conscience and to be willing to pay the price that society requires.

‘There is no doubt at all that the confession in this case resulted in a conviction which never otherwise would have happened.

‘Only the defendant knew the deceased was dead, only the defendant knew he had been killed and only the defendant knew where he was buried.’,

Puxty had targeted Mr Clement after finding out he had £93,000 in his bank account.

After tying the dad-of-three up Puxty then used a ‘pressure point technique’ he learned in the Marines to kill him before dumping his body in woodland in Kent.

The 31-year-old former Royal Marine then went on a spending spree, spending more than £50,000 on motorbikes, TVs and flash watches, before becoming ‘overcome with guilt’ and handing himself into Plumstead Police station in March 2010.

The killer, who admitted manslaughter claiming he didn’t mean to kill his victim, then took police to a remote spot in woods near Ashford, Kent, where he had buried his 60-year-old victim’s body in a shallow grave.

He was jailed for life at Kingston Crown Court in December last year after being found guilty of murdering dad-of-three Mr Clements - who had never been reported missing - and told he would serve a minimum of 28 years behind bars.

When contacted by MailOnline, the Metropolitan Police were unable to comment on the latest details to emerge about Puxty's arrest.

But in a statement from the Met released after Puxty was found guilty of murder in December last year it made no reference to Puxty being turned away from Plumstead police station.

It stated: ‘In March 2010 following his release from prison on other matters, Puxty attended Plumstead police station and confessed to killing Lee.

’Following his arrest, the investigation was referred to the Homicide and Serious Crime Command and a murder investigation was launched.

‘Detailed and extensive enquiries revealed that following the disposal of the body, Puxty withdrew money from Lee’s bank account, taking approximately £50,000 over a three month period in order to fuel his drugs and alcohol addiction, as well his liking for luxury goods and motorbikes.’
