A mother who gave birth days after a rare nerve condition left her paralysed has made an incredible recovery.

Kayla Bufton, 24, has now finally been able to pick up her daughter for the first time.

She thought she had gone into early labour when she started feeling twinges in her back when she was 36 weeks pregnant.

Kayla Bufton, 24, was paralysed just days before giving birth to baby Kelsey but she has now, a year on, made an amazing recovery and is able to hold her daughter with ease for the first time

But a week later, the mother-of-three was completely paralysed - unable to move her legs, arms, or facial muscles.

Doctors believe she was struck down with Guillain-Barré syndrome, a rare condition that affects the nervous system.

Amazingly, she still managed to give birth to daughter Kelsey, despite not even being able to feel her own contractions.

But after her daughter was born, Ms Bufton suffered a cardiac arrest and was put into an induced coma.

Incredibly, after almost a year of gruelling rehab, the determined mother has taken her first steps and has finally been able to hold her daughter in her arms and give her a proper cuddle.

And despite Ms Bufton still undergoing tests to determine her exact condition, she is now well on the road to recovery.

Ms Bufton (pictured with Kelsey) started feeling twinges in her back when she was 36 weeks pregnant so she thought she was going into early labour but within a week she was unable to move her legs, arms or face

Ms Bufton (pictured with her partner, William, Kelsey, and their sons Kayden and McKauly) was diagnosed with suspected Guillain-Barré syndrome - a rare nerve condition which occurs when the immune system starts attacking the nervous system

Ms Bufton, from Blackburn, Lancashire, said: ‘I’m so grateful to be getting better and to have my family around me.

‘It feels amazing to be able to hold my little girl in my arms and do all the things I dreamed about while I was lying in hospital.

‘I was so scared when my body stopped working, and I couldn’t feel my baby kicking inside me any more.

Guillain-Barre syndrome (pronounced Ghee-lan Bar-ray) syndrome is a rare but serious condition of the nerves that control the body's senses and movements.

It affects about 1,500 people in the UK every year and is slightly more common in men than women.

It causes the immune system (the body’s natural defence against infection and illness) to attack these nerves, causing them to become inflamed.

Symptoms include a tingly, numb sensation in the arms and legs which can result in a loss of feeling and movement.

Most people who develop it have suffered from a viral or bacterial infection a few weeks before.

Around 80 per cent of people make a full recovery within a few weeks or months, and do not have any further problems such as permanent nerve damage.

‘But it was the thought of holding her in my arms and playing with my two little boys that gave me the motivation I needed to keep going with my rehab, no matter how tough it got.

‘Doctors are still doing tests on me to establish exactly what happened, but I’m determined that whatever is wrong with me, I will beat it.’

Ms Bufton’s pregnancy had gone smoothly until she started getting tingling pains in her back at 36 weeks.

This led her to believe she had gone into early labour, in April last year.

But when the pain continued, she thought her baby was lying on a nerve.

However, terrifyingly, she then lost the feeling in her legs and started tripping over.

She said: ‘My left leg kept dropping, and I started tripping up, which I knew wasn’t normal, as I’d never had anything similar with my two other children, Kayden, two, and McKauly, six.

‘I was terrified about falling and hurting my baby, and my whole upper body was tingling and tight.

‘I couldn’t feel my arms properly, and I had no feeling in my belly.

‘My face dropped to one side, and I was rushed into hospital. The paramedics thought I had suffered a stroke and I was terrified.

‘At the hospital, the neurologist took one look at me and told me straight away he thought I had GBS. I had no idea what it was.’

Terrifyingly, as her condition spread, more muscles in Ms Bufton’s body became paralysed, and doctors at Preston Royal Infirmary were forced to attach her to a monitor as she wasn’t able to feel when she went into labour.

She said: ‘I couldn’t even eat or drink, I just had to lie there.

Ms Bufton had to give birth to Kelsey even though she could not feel her contractions and was unaware she had gone into labour until doctors told her. She is pictured with her son, Kayden

After Kelsey's birth, Ms Bufton suffered a cardiac arrest and had to be put in an induced coma

‘A week after I’d gone into hospital I noticed my belly moving, and a team of doctors appeared round my bed. My contractions had begun and I couldn’t feel them.

‘When Kelsey was born, she was whisked away, and I started getting even worse.

‘I was taken to the intensive care unit, where I was intubated, and my lung collapsed.

‘Two days later, I suffered a cardiac arrest and was put into a coma for a week, but still couldn’t feel any part of my body when I came round.’

While Kelsey was allowed home with Ms Bufton’s partner, William, 24, she remained in intensive care.

Ms Bufton was so ill that she was not able to see Kelsey again for another eight weeks

Ms Bufton (pictured with Kelsey and her partner, William) was so weak she was not even able to speak

It was eight weeks before she was stable enough for William and her mother, Carol, to bring Kelsey to see her.

Ms Bufton said: ‘It was amazing. The nurses propped my bed up and surrounded me with cushions so they could lay Kelsey on my lap.

‘I couldn’t hold her like I wanted to, but I was so overwhelmed to finally meet my little girl.

‘I was worried my two boys would be scared to see me in hospital hooked up to machines and not able to speak to them, so I didn’t see them for nearly three months. It was heart-breaking.

‘I gradually regained some of my muscle use, and had to learn to speak all over again. It was so tough, but I was determined to be able to tell my kids I loved them.

‘Rehab was the most painful thing I have ever been through in my life, but I just knew I had to keep going for them.

Ms Bufton had to have months of intensive rehabilitation while she learned to walk, talk and use her arms again. She said it was the thought of being able to hold and play with her children that got her through it

‘I was desperate to be at home having night after night of broken sleep and changing nappies.

‘William would tell me how Kelsey had had a bad night’s sleep and in an weird way, I was jealous because I wanted to be the one at home comforting her and pacing the landing with her.’

After managing to regain feeling in her arms, Ms Bufton managed to stand up for the first time last August - five months after contracting the illness - and was moved to a rehab centre, where she had to relearn to use her upper body.

She said: ‘Last week, I took my first couple of steps. It’s such a good feeling to know I’m slowly getting there.

‘But the best feeling was being able to hug my three children and their dad again. I thought I was going to burst with happiness.

‘I know I’ve still got a long way to go, but I’m determined to get there for my family.

Ms Bufton said: 'I'm so grateful to be getting better and to have my family around me. It feels amazing to be able to hold my little girl in my arms and do all the things I dreamed about while I was lying in hospital'

‘I couldn’t have got where I am today without all the help and support of the staff at the Royal Preston Hospital and the Rakehead Rehab Centre in Burnley. They have been absolutely fantastic.’

A spokesperson for Guillain-Barré and Associated Inflammatory Neuropathies (GAIN) said: ‘Kayla was diagnosed in May 2013 initially with the acute disease Guillain-Barré syndrome, although medics are still carrying out further tests.

‘It affects around 1,200 to 1,500 people per year and is neither age or gender specific although slightly more common in the old and in men.

‘GBS is a clinical syndrome rather than a specific individual disease and is due to inflammation of the peripheral nerves which is probably caused because the immune cells start attacking the nerves in error instead of fighting the infection.

Ms Bufton said: 'I couldn't have got where I am today without all the help and support of the staff at the Royal Preston Hospital and the Rakehead Rehab Centre in Burnley. They have been absolutely fantastic'

Doctors are still trying to establish exactly what is wrong with Ms Bufton but she is making a good recovery. Image shows a scan of Kelsey six months into her mother's pregnancy

‘It causes weakness and loss of sensation that usually recovers after a few weeks or months, although it is difficult to give exact timeframes the majority of people remain affected for between three and six months.

‘Kayla’s recovery is going well and she is receiving significant rehabilitation to help her in her recovery.’
