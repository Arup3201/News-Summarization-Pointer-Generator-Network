The parents of ISIS hostage Abdul-Rahman Kassig  attended an Islamic service today to pray for their only son after militants named him as the next beheading victim. 

Ed and Paula Kassig requested the service at the Islamic Society of North America in Plainfield, Indiana on Friday afternoon at 2pm. 

The service was multi-faith and honored the humanitarian work that Mr Kassig, a 26-year-old Indiana native, carried out in Syria before he was captured by the extremists last October.

Mr Kassig was named by ISIS as their next victim  following the beheading of British hostage Alan Henning in a video, posted online last Friday.

Edgar Hopida, from the Islamic Society, told WTHR that they were fearful for Mr Kassig but maintained a sense of hope.

Mr Hopida said: 'He's one of our own. He's a Hoosier. He's also our brother in Islam, and so we want to support the family. We want to support Peter by having a short program to honor his work.'

Mrs Kassig will read messages from friends at the service.  

The Islam society welcomed everyone and asked guests to dress conservatively. The group said they would appreciate if woman wore headscarves but it was not required. 

The 26-year-old was shown in an ISIS video last Friday depicting the beheading of British aid worker Alan Henning. 

Kassig was taken captive last October as he worked for the aid organization he founded in Syria. 

In the past week, Mr Kassig's parents have appealed directly to the terror group leader on Twitter, begging him to spare their only son's life.

They reached out to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi over social media. On Wednesday, the hostage's family posted a message to Twitter pleading to the ISIS leader directly.

On Wednesday, the hostage's mother, Paula Kassig, posted a message to Twitter pleading directly to the ISIS leader for her son's life

In a video released last Friday, Islamic State militants threatened to kill 26-year-old American aid worker Abdul-Rahman Kassig

The letter read: 'I am trying to get in touch with the Islamic State about my son's fate. I am an old woman, and Abdul-Rahman is my only child.

'My husband and I are on our own, with no help from the government. We would like to talk to you. How can we reach you?'

In a video published to YouTube on October 4, the Kassigs sat on a couch and spoke about the 26-year-old's humanitarian work during a desperate plea for his life.

'We are so very proud of you and the work you have done to bring humanitarian aid to the Syrian people,' Mrs Kassig said in the video as she clutched a photo of her son to her chest. 'Please know that we are all praying for you and your safe return.' 

Abdul-Rahman Kassig, 26, was called Peter before converting to Islam. His name, Abdul-Rahman, means 'servant of the most merciful'.

He was captured by ISIS militants on October 1, 2013 while doing humanitarian work in eastern Syria.
