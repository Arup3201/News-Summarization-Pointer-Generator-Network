Google is planning to release a maps app for the iPhone and iPad in a head on battle with Apple.

The search giant had its maps dumped by Apple in the latest version of its iOS software.

However, now it is set to hit back with its own app - if Apple approves it.

The Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol as it appears in Apple's maps. The firm has come under fire for some of its 3D photography which has distorted buildings, and is set to face fresh competition from Google's map app.

It is believed Google has been working on the app for months, as Apple revealed it was creating its own mapping service in June.

Maps are an extremely lucrative service for both firms due to revenue from advertisers keen to appear in searches.

However, sources close to Google have claimed the app, which is expected to be free, has recently been submitted to Apple for approval.

This means it could be available within days.

However, Google faces one major hurdle - Apple.

To have an app in the iTunes download store, it must be approved by Apple - which has tough rules on app that compete with 
existing functionality'.

No official statement has been made by either firm, but experts believe Apple holds the key.

'Maps generate huge amount of revenue, but the key is whether Apple will approve it - for instance, Google's voice app has been delayed for over a year,' said Stuart Miles of gadget website Pocket Lint.

'Apple could say it is too similar a product to its Maps service.'

Even Transport for London has  turned on Apple's maps, with this sign being displayed at Hackney Wick station.

Apple has already come under fire for its maps service, although the firm did today admit it needed improvement.

'We are continuously improving it, and as Maps is a cloud-based solution, the more people use it, the better it will get," said spokeswoman Trudy Muller.

'We appreciate all of the customer feedback and are working hard to make the customer experience even better," added Ms Muller.

Users are also encouraged to use a 'Report a
