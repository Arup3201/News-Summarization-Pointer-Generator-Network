Ronny Deila  has insisted that he already has other striker options lined up should John Guidetti not agree a permanent switch to Celtic.

The Parkhead club are thought to have some interest in Maccabi Tel Aviv forward Tal Ben Haim, but sources have played down reports in Israel linking the club with a £1.5million offer.

Deila is still optimistic that a deal can be done to keep Guidetti at the end of his season-long loan from Manchester City.

John Guidetti has failed to score for the Scottish champions in six matches but his confidence remains high

But he has also told the 22-year-old Swede that he is not the only name in the frame to strengthen their attacking options going forward.

‘Celtic also has options, it’s not all one-way,’ said Deila. ‘We have to work to get Guidetti, but he also has to be happy that we want him. It works two ways, always.

‘Playing at Celtic is a big thing and you can see that with other players who want to play for us.

Celtic boss Ronny Deila has looked at other options should Guidetti not agree a permanent switch 

‘We have to look at different options if it doesn’t happen, but, hopefully, it happens and I’m positive we can do it.

‘Do I have other options? Yes, but anyway John is going to be here until the end of the season, so it’s not like we are losing him on February 1.’

Guidetti made a stunning start to life in Glasgow with 11 goals in his first 12 games, but then endured a five-game blank streak that saw him drop to the bench for Celtic’s 2-0 Premiership win against Kilmarnock 12 days ago.

However, speaking during last week’s training camp in Gran Canaria, the 22-year-old dismissed talk of any crisis of confidence. Instead, he boldly set his sights on becoming the first Celtic player to score a hat-trick against Rangers in 41 years when the clubs meet in a League Cup semi-final at Hampden a fortnight on Sunday.

Ben Haim, meanwhile, is also reported to have attracted interest from Standard Liege, PAOK Salonika and Dynamo Kiev. It is claimed the 25-year-old is valued at around £1.75million.
