He has promised to lead a healthier liftestyle after admitting taking crack cocaine in a 'drunken stupor' and it appears Rob Ford is keeping to his word as he is pictured leaving the gym following a gruelling workout.

The shamed Toronto mayor looked like he was gasping for breath as he mopped sweat from his forehead on his way back to a committee meeting at City Hall following the workout yesterday.

Ford, who has pledged to lose between 40 and 50 pounds in six months, has claimed latest allegations about his drug-taking are 'completely untrue'.

Out of puff: Mayor Rob Ford returns to his office at Toronto's City Hall after working up a sweat in the gym. He has pledged to lead a healthier lifestyle after admitting smoking crack cocaine in a 'drunken stupor'

Workout: Mayor Ford mops the sweat from his brow as he returns to work at City Hall. He promised to lose between 40 and 50 pounds in six months

The mayor, who remains in office but has been stripped of most of his powers, weighed 330lbs  earlier this year but says he has now quit drinking and adopted a healthier lifestyle.

He acknowledged last month that he smoked
crack in a 'drunken stupor' about a year ago after a video emerged of him apparently using the drug. He had previously denied its existence.

The mayor, who remains in office but has been stripped of most of his powers, weighed 330lbs earlier this year but says he has quit drinking and adopted a healthier lifestyle

Yesterday he denied allegations he offered $5,000 and a car to suspected drug dealers to buy back the video, court documents suggest.

On Wednesday, courts released remaining sections of the 472 page police document covering their investigation into the Mayor's alleged drug abuse, which includes suggestions of heroin use, blackmail and kidnapping.

The mayor addressed the issue during an appearance today on a Washington-based sports talk show to make NFL picks on WJFK-FM. 

'Number
one that's an outright lie and number two you can talk to my lawyers 
about it, but I'm here to talk about football guys,' Ford said.

In police wiretaps of alleged gang members one is heard telling another that he rejected the offer for the tape and planned to meet the mayor and ask for '150,' meaning $150,000.

Elsewhere in the recordings the men spoke about delivering drugs to Ford and having pictures of him using drugs.

On one wiretap on April 20, an alleged
gang member is heard saying, 'Rob Ford was smoking his rocks today' and
that he would post a picture on Instagram.

On
another wiretap, one man says he has many pictures of Ford 'doing the 
hezza,' which police say is known to be slang for heroin.

Another man suggests those pictures would be worth a lot, the document says. 

Ford
has refused to resign as mayor of Toronto, Canada's largest city and 
financial capital, despite mounting pressure after a string of incidents
that have embarrassed his constituents, from public drunkenness to 
appearing in another video that showed him threatening 'murder' in an 
incoherent rant.

Worse for wear: The trip to the gym appears to have taken its toll as the Mayor struggles to stay alert during the meeting

Ford admitted that he smoked crack 
cocaine after police said they had obtained a video during an 
investigation into his friend Alexander Lisi that appears to show him 
puffing on a crack pipe.

The
newly released court documents say police heard on the wiretaps that 
Ford had his phone stolen or lost it at a home they believe to be a 
crack house and that Lisi was trying to get it back.

Police
say they overheard that Lisi threatened to 'put the heat on' the gang 
if he didn't get Ford's phone back and that the alleged gang members 
said they would not tolerate Lisi's threats because they had a picture 
of Ford 'on a pipe,' which police believed meant a crack pipe. Police 
say Lisi gave the men marijuana in exchange for the return of the 
mayor's phone.

Bulk: The mayor, who remains in office despite having been stripped of most of his powers, weighed as much as 330lbs earlier this year

Under pressure: Ford denied allegations in newly released court documents that he offered $5,000 and a car to suspected drug dealers in exchange for a video that appears to show him smoking crack

Confession: Ford admitted that he smoked crack cocaine after police said they had obtained a video during an investigation into his friend Alexander Lisi that appears to show him puffing on a crack pipe

Dennis Morris, Ford's lawyer, said the wiretaps are snippets of alleged gangsters who are talking among themselves.

'It's very dangerous to put any weight into any of this,' Mr Morris told The Associated Press. 'There's nothing to address.'

City councilor Joe Mihevc said police need to examine the allegations that Ford tried to obtain the tape.

'The
mayor can't come out and say, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,"' said 
Mr Mihevc. 'This man needs help. He needs a lot of help.'

Scandal: A still image allegedly taken from the video that purportedly shows Ford smoking crack

Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair 
declined to comment on the newly released documents. The wiretaps are 
evidence in the case against Lisi, who faces trial on drug and extortion
charges.

The mayor has not been charged.

'All
of the evidence that was gathered in that case has been reviewed by 
investigators and with the Crown prosecutors in this case, and where 
reasonable and probable grounds to lay a charge exists, charges have 
been laid,' said Mr Blair.

Police were in the 
midst of a drug and weapons investigation involving alleged members of 
the Dixon Bloods gang when the mayor's name surfaced on wiretaps in 
March and April.

Police 
didn't open an investigation into Ford and Lisi until May, when U.S. 
website Gawker and the Toronto Star reported that alleged drug dealers 
were shopping around the crack video.

Comic figure: Ford has refused to resign as mayor of Toronto, Canada's largest city and financial capital, despite mounting pressure after a string of incidents that have embarrassed his constituents

Ford says he has quit drinking and adopted a healthier lifestyle. And he's not avoiding the spotlight. He's agreed to appear on a Washington-based sports talk show to make NFL picks.

Councillor Janet Davis said the image of Ford laughing at the newest revelations demonstrates his arrogance and lack of judgment.

'If he laughed today, and thousands and thousands of people of the city of Toronto saw that he was laughing at what was revealed today, it will just simply deepen the anger toward this man,' said Mr Davis.
