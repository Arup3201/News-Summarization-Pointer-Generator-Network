Manchester United target Bruno Martins Indi has signed a four-year deal with Porto after leaving Feyenoord.

The Holland international, who was born in Portugal, has joined Porto for a reported fee of £6million after playing in six games at the World Cup for Louis van Gaal's side.

With Van Gaal set to take the reins at Old Trafford the imposing centre-back had been heavily linked with a move to United before his former side announced his Portugal switch.

'This move comes at a good time for Bruno in his career,' said Feyenoord's technical director Martin van Geel.

'A big part of his training came at Feyenoord and he became an important player in our first team and now is also a full international.

'He is ready to move abroad. We wish Bruno good luck with this new challenge in his career.'

'To me, this feels like the right time to leave,' said the 22-year-old, who made his debut for Feyenoord in August 2010.

'I now have over a hundred games for the club and have played at a World Cup. I have said from the beginning that I hoped if I ever made the next step in my career it would be for the best of me and the club.

'Feyenoord have benefited financially from my departure while I can take on a new challenge in Portugal.

'Besides a special thanks to my teammates, I would also like to thank the fans for their unconditional support.

'For a guy like me, the Rotterdam fans' support had a positive effect on my performance.

'I am sure that in the future many more players, especially the boys from the Feyenoord youth system, can benefit from the unique interaction between the team and its supporters.'

Indi made 102 league appearances for the Eredivisie side, scoring five goals during that time.

The defender's departure is another blow for Feyenoord, who have already sold Graziano Pelle to Southampton this summer and Daryl Janmaat to Newcastle.

Fellow defender Stefan De Vrij also seems set for a move away from Rotterdam this summer.
