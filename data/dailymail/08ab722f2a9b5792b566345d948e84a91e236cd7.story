The Australian soldier who died after falling down a crevasse while leading a training exercise on New Zealand's highest mountain has been identified as Sergeant Gary Francis.

The 44-year-old had climbed Mount Everest twice and was an expert in mountaineering and mountain warfare, news.com.au reported.

He fell down a 40-metre crevasse on the Grand Plateau on Aoraki Mt Cook on the South Island and was unable to be revived, local police confirmed.

The Australian Department of Defence said Sergeant Francis was from the Sydney-based 2nd Commando Regiment.

A former commando described him as the 'Yoda of climbing'.

'He's summited Mount Everest twice and has a world record for the highest rescue in history,' he told News Corp.

Sergeant Francis showed his love of the outdoors in a YouTube video he posted of his 2013 highlights, during which he skied in Japan, went climbing in the Blue Mountains and went dirt biking in Louee, NSW.

He was a father of two and his wife was in Scotland yesterday, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.

The Australian Army members were conducting a two week mountain and cold weather operations training activity in New Zealand, a defence spokesman said.

'No other Army members were injured and the training was immediately suspended,' he said.

'The soldier was recovered by his colleagues who administered first aid. Sadly, they were unable to revive him and the New Zealand emergency services later declared the soldier deceased.'

Defence said the soldier was highly qualified and experienced in alpine, mountain and altitude activities.

Defence is providing Sergeant Francisâ€™ family with support.

He was one of a party of ten people, NZ police said.

The matter has been referred to the Coroner.

Alpine Guides manager Arthur McBride told AAP accidents like this happened occasionally on the mountain, but occurred anywhere there was crevasse terrain.

Mr McBride said crevasses could be invisible if snow fell over them, but if people were roped to each other they would usually be safe.

He said the accident was unrelated to the rock avalanche on the other side of the mountain on Tuesday.

At 3724 metres, Mt Cook is New Zealand's tallest mountain.
