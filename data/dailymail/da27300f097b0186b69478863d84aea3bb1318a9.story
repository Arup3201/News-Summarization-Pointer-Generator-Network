For many children, the new school year means a reinvention of playground style, with cooler schoolbags and brighter pencil cases replacing last year's tired trends. 

The majority of discarded attire is forgotten about for years to come, as are the once loved fictional figures who were proudly paraded on the front of lunchboxes.

But one man is pleased to remind the world of times gone by, with an astonishing collection of metal lunchboxes in Columbus, Georgia.

The Lunchbox Museum in Columbus, Georgia is home to more than 2,000 vintage lunchboxes and thermoses

Though Mr Woodall has been collecting metal lunchboxes for over 30 years, he carried his lunch to school in a paper bag

The Lunchbox Museum in the Rivermarket Antique Mall is the ultimate destination for a trip down memory lane, with more than 2,000 vintage lunchboxes and thermoses hanging from its walls and ceiling.

Open since 1991 the world's largest lunchbox museum reminds visitors of the things they loved as children, to the delight of curator, Allen Woodall.

Mr Woodall, 79, fell in love with the colourful metal boxes when he saw two at a flea market as a child, after using a brown paper bag to carry his own lunch to school, he told Cool Hunting. 

After purchasing the Green Hornet and Dick Tracey boxes, he went on to amass the shop's collection over 30 years, before deciding to open the museum in 1991.

He told MailOnline: 'I've always had a passion for lunchboxes.

'Around 1989 I took a trip to St Louis to view the collection of a man who had died'

Among his hoard of 80s classics are Bee Gees, Beatles and Star Wars boxes which help remind visitors of things they once loved

Metal lunchboxes went out of fashion in the 1980s when plastic models became more popular

'His widow was selling the lunchboxes which had attracted collectors from New York and L.A. and all over the place.'

Mr Woodall said he knew he didn't stand much of a chance at getting his hands on the boxes with other such experienced enthusiasts there.

'I knew it would be hard for the widow to be selling them.

'So I gave her my word that if she sold them to me, I would use them as the foundation for a museum, and dedicate my book to her late husband,' which is exactly what he did.

His Illustrated Encyclopedia of Metal Lunchboxes was published in 1992 with a dedication to Mr Bob Carr on its front pages.

Mr Carr's collection of 750 lunchboxes was the beginning of the museum which is now home to more than 2,000 lunch boxes, thermoses, and related memorabilia.

79-year-old Allen Woodall decided to open the museum after purchasing the collection of another enthusiast in 1989

The 'off the wall' collection features lunchboxes from WWI in addition to more popular, modern models inspired by TV, film and books

Mr Woodall sources the boxes from all over the country by buying, selling and trading online

Among the most rare is an original Beatles Yellow Submarine box, and a Star Wars model from the 1980s, while the oldest date back to WWI.

Unsurprisingly, designs were a little simpler back then, with drawings of trains and boy scouts proudly shown where the Bee Gees and Batman stood later.

'I only sell duplicates' said Mr Woodall who keeps original models in the museum's safe possession for passers-by to admire.

Keen for visitors to touch the lunchboxes for themselves, Mr Woodall merely cleans and polishes them to keep them in good condition.

Metal lunchboxes went out of fashion in the 1980s after the more easily sourced and moulded plastic became more popular.
