A forlorn Shia LaBeouf headed to court in New York today to face multiple charges for his bizarre outburst during a Broadway performance last month.

The actor, who wore a sharp suit as he appeared at Manhattan Criminal Court, is trying to work out an agreement with prosecutors to resolve the case, his attorney told the judge on Thursday.

LaBeouf, 28, has been charged with harassment, disorderly conduct and criminal trespassing for allegedly yelling abuse and slapping actors' behinds during a performance of 'Cabaret' on June 26.

On Thursday, the actor and his lawyer, G. Robert Gage, declined to comment as they left court amid a swarm of cameras and microphones. Shortly afterwards, he was pictured leaving his hotel wearing his usual scruffy uniform of a t-shirt, jeans and combat boots as he headed to the airport.

Deal? His lawyer said he and prosecutors are trying to figure out an agreement in LaBeouf's disorderly conduct case. They will return to court next month

He will be back in court in September 10.

On June 26, the former child actor had reportedly spent the afternoon drinking margaritas at Iguana Bar in Midtown and watching Belgium play South Korea in the World Cup.

Later that afternoon, he was seen wild-eyed and disheveled as he chased a homeless man through traffic in broad daylight around the city's Theater District, photographs show.

It seemed the actor wanted either a bag of McDonald's food or a baseball cap that the man had. The actor repeatedly said: 'It's me, Shia', earlier reports show.

Then, hours later, the troubled actor was led away in tears from the Studio 54 theater on West 54th Street around after causing the disturbance during the first act of Cabaret.

On Twitter, Tony nominated composer Benj Pasek wrote: 'Just saw Shia LaBeouf in handcuffs in tears surrounded by 6 police offers outside of Cabaret the musical.'

LaBeouf screamed at the arresting officer: 'F*** you... this is f****** b******t... Do you know my life? Do you know who the f*** I am?', according to The Smoking Gun.

Officers told the New York Post that LaBeouf was 'incoherent and agitated' during the arrest. One said that the actor smelled bad and told lies about having served in the military.

Since the melee, he has been taking part in an outpatient alcohol treatment program.

Another celebrated actor also had a Manhattan court date Thursday. Alec Baldwin was to appear in a separate disorderly conduct case.

Baldwin was arrested in May. Police say he got belligerent after being stopped riding a bicycle the wrong way down a one-way street.

Sadly, Shia LaBeouf's arrest for 
disorderly conduct at a Broadway theater on Thursday is just the latest 
incident in a string of erratic episodes for the former child star.

At the end of last year, the Transformers star admitted that he had plagiarized 52-year-old cartoonist Daniel Clowes' graphic novel in a short film, HowardCantour.com, starring Jim Gaffigan.

Observant viewers attacked the film as an almost direct adaptation of Clowes' 2007 comic even though Shia had initially failed to give Daniel any credit.

His actions were called 'shameless theft' by the comic's publisher Eric Reynolds and a steady string of apologies from Shia ensued.

He then made headlines when he walked the red carpet at the Berlin Film 
Festival with a brown paper bag over his head.

Around the same time he declared he was 'retiring from public life because of attacks against his artistic integrity'.

Early this year, LaBeouf also got into a scuffle with a fellow drinker at the 
Hobgoblin pub in New Cross, South London, headbutting him apparently 
over remarks made about the mother of his girlfriend Mia Goth.

And last year, the actor famously quit the 
production of Broadway's ORPHANS then shared several confrontational emails 
between himself and fellow actors Alex Baldwin and Tom Sturridge, 
explaining why he pulled out of the show.Â 

In 2007, he was arrested for refusing to leave a Walgreens in Chicago but the criminal charges were later dropped.

In
 February 2005, LaBeouf was arrested in Los Angeles and charged with 
assault with a deadly weapon for driving into his neighbor's car after 
losing his temper about having to wait to get into his garage. He then 
later turned up at his neighbor's door, allegedly waving a kitchen 
knife.
