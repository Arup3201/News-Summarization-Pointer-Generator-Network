Matthew Campbell, 27, has walked free from court despite running over and killing Dr Nicholas Musgrove outside Wolverhampton University

A driver who was distracted by a mass of air fresheners and soft toys hanging from his rear-view mirror when he killed a university lecturer has walked free from court.

Matthew Campbell, 27, ran down and killed Dr Nicholas Musgrove as he walked to work at Wolverhampton University on December 20, 2012.

Witnesses said the scientist was struck so hard he was sent hurtling through the air 'like a rag doll'.

The 64-year-old was rushed to hospital but later died from his injuries following the crash, which happened at 6.15am.

A court heard Campbell had eight air fresheners, a pair of 3D glasses, a soft Rhino toy and a key-ring hanging in front of his windscreen which had impaired his view.

The black Mazda 2 also had illegally tinted windows which was said to have also contributed to his failure to react in enough time.

Campbell, a fork lift truck driver, denied causing death by careless or inconsiderate driving at Wolverhampton Crown Court.

But a jury of eight men and four women found him guilty following a three day trial on April 24.

Yesterday he appeared at the same court where he was sentenced to six months imprisonment, suspended for two years.

Campbell, from Whitmore Reans, Wolverhampton, was also placed on supervision for 12 months and banned from driving for two years.

Sentencing Judge Nicholas Webb said the lapse in concentration by Campbell was only for a matter of seconds but 'tragically it resulted in a fatality.'

He said: 'It was unfortunate Dr Musgrove started to cross the road but he was in the road for long enough for you to have taken avoiding action.'

The judge added that but for the short lapse of concentration by Campbell there could be no other criticism of his driving.

Defending Phillip Morris said Campbell was 'full of remorse' and added: 'He is truly very sorrowful for the outcome of this accident.

During the trail, the jury heard that Campbell was distracted by eight air fresheners, a pair of 3D glasses, and a rhino head cuddly toy hanging from his rear-view mirror (pictured)

'There was a period of just three and a half seconds between Dr Musgrove stepping off the kerb and being hit by his vehicle.'

After the case West Midlands Police 
released a shocking image of the bundle of key rings showing Campbell’s 
smashed windscreen in the aftermath of the crash as a warning to other 
drivers.

Speaking after the
 case Martin Lindop, Sector Crown Prosecutor from West Midlands Crown 
Prosecution Service, said: 'This prosecution should be a warning to all 
drivers that they have a duty of care to other road users at all times.

'It
 would also appear that Mr Campbell may have restricted his view by 
having illegally tinted windows and items hanging from the rear-view 
mirror, which may have contributed to this tragic collision.

'The defendant failed to see Dr Musgrove crossing the road. When he eventually spotted him, he tried to carry out an evasive manoeuvre, but it was too little too late and his car struck the victim.'

His trial heard how Dr Musgrove, from Walsall, West Mids., had crossed the road without activating the pedestrian lights or waiting for the traffic signals to turn to red.

He crossed the road - one of the busiest in the city - at the same time as Campbell was approaching the junction who failed to take evasive action.

Wolverhampton Crown Court heard that Campbell had lost concentration for just a few seconds because of the air fresheners, but that those few seconds resulted in a man being killed

Prosecutor Nicholas Tatlow told the court the bundle of objects from his mirror caused a partial obstruction.

Campbell said a Rhino head had been a gift from his cousin and when it fell off his key ring he put it on his driving mirror.

He said the glasses were 3D ones he had got from a cinema adding: 'I had my car cleaned by my friend every week and he would put an air freshener in there each time.'

Staff at the University of Wolverhampton paid tribute to Dr Musgrove - a former scrap man who went on to complete a BSc and a PhD at the university.

Dr Derek Walton, associate dean of the school of applied sciences said: 'He genuinely was a terrific bloke, who will be sorely missed by all his colleagues across the university and the many students he helped.'

Vice chancellor Professor Geoff Layer added: 'Nick was well known, well liked and passionate about what he did.'
