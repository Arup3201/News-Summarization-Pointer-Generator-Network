With daylight saving time now in full swing, maybe it's time for a spring clean.

And that was certainly the thought Rigby the hedgehog's owner had this month.

Andrea Pruden, 20, from Coral Springs, Florida, decided to give the spiny critter a well-earned wash.

Video footage of the salon session shows Rigby splashing around a glass bowl placed in a bathroom sink.

Pruden starts by rinsing the small creature off before squirting some pet-friendly shampoo on his coat.

She then lovingly combs the lotion through Rigby's spines.

Not a patch is missed, with his feet and belly also scrubbed clean. 

At one point the baby hedgehog bundles up into a ball. 

He then proceeds to throw a blissful look towards the camera.

To finish, the soap suds are rinsed off Rigby's body.

Pruden then gently bundles him up in a white towel to dry off.

The pet owner later wrote on Instragram, alongside a photo of Rigby's spruced up hair: 'Smelly Rigby got a nice warm bath.'

One fan deemed the spring-cleaned animal 'beautiful'.
