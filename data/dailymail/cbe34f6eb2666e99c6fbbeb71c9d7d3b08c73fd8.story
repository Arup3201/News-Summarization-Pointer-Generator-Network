Diego Costa will be fit to face Chelsea in the Champions League despite colliding with a post on Sunday night in Atletico Madrid's 2-0 win at Getafe.

One Atletico source even claimed that the woodwork came off worse than Costa after the striker crashed into it while scoring the side's second goal.

The hitman left El Coliseum Alfonso Perez smiling, despite initial fears that he may have sustained a serious injury.

Costa was not taken to hospital for the cut and was treated at the stadium.

He was later seen with a bandaged leg and a slight limp as he was driven home from Atletico's training facilities.

Costa signed autographs for fans outside Atletico's training ground on Monday and when one asked him if he was going to play on Friday, the striker replied: 'Yes, of course.'

Costa
 should be ready to start against Elche on Friday night, although 
Atletico may choose to keep him fresh to face Chelsea four days later.

Press officer Jose Luis Pasques wrote on Twitter: 'Relax everyone. Itâ€™s all OK. Just need to fix the post.'

Costa
 was making his return from a hamstring problem, which had kept him out 
of Atletico's Champions League quarter-final second leg victory over 
Barcelona.

The 25-year-old 
had an eventful game, being booked for shoving someone to the ground and
 missing a penalty after someone in the crowd 'mooned' him.

He eventually scored by bravely flinging himself at the post to convert from close range.

'Costa is fine, he is happy,' said manager Diego Simeone after the match. 'He made a great effort throughout. One more cut does not do anything to this tiger.'

Costa has 26 goals in La Liga this season and has been an essential part of Simeone's side's title bid.

The
 forward is on Jose Mourinho's transfer target list this summer, but 
Chelsea would have been grateful for his absence in their semi-final 
tie.
