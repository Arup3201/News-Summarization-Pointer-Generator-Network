An aerial view of a Canadian health centre has revealed that the building is shaped exactly like a naked, spread-eagled man - complete with male genitals.

Locals believe the Newmarket Health Centre in Ontario got its distinctive shape by accident, with a series of small extensions being added to the original design.

Amusingly the building is believed to house a STD clinic, among other medical facilities, with visitors having to enter the building through the groin area before they can have their check-up.

Aerial photographs of the Newmarket Health Centre show four wings branching out from a central hub that look like arms and legs.

While the arms simply look outstretched, the building's legs are far more detailed - even appearing to have kneecaps and feet.

At the top of the building is a square block resembling a head and nestling in what would be the groin area is a red-covered extension that looks like male genitals.

Neighbours believe the building got its unique shape by accident but don't mind because the town is the birthplace of two of the country's most famous comedians - Jim Carrey and John Candy.

Local resident Peter Kaufman said: 'It's not something you would notice at all, really and we don't seem to mind.

'Having part of it look like a man's penis is particularly amusing. I'm sure Jim Carrey and John Candy will find it funny,' he added.

The Newmarket Health Centre is a medical facility in the heart of Ontario's Newmarket neighbourhood. 

The walk-in clinic specialises in laboratory services, travel counseling, cardiac services, an onsite pharmacy and complete rehabilitation services.
