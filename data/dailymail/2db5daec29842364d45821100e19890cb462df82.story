Saving fuel on flights is a weighty issue for airlines with rising oil prices eating into their profits.

In a somewhat controversial move, 
Ryanair spokesperson Stephen McNamara said Ryanair staff had been asked to consider their own body weight in a bid to reduce aircraft weight and avoid hefty industry costs.

The budget airline has also announced it is to reduce the size of its in-flight magazine, serve less ice in drinks and encourage its staff not to pile on the pounds.

'We cut costs wherever possible, and the changes will represent a significant reduction in weight,' Mr McNamara told the Daily Telegraph.

'We also considered removing armrests, but decided against it. We even encourage staff to watch their weight – with the motivation of appearing in the annual Ryanair calendar.'

The latest policy will see the airline's in-flight magazine 'Let's Go with Ryanair' being reduced from an A4 to an A5 format and it will also double as a menu, which could save thousands of pounds in fuel thanks to the reduced amount of paper used.

The low-cost carrier also estimates it will save more than £400,000 in printing costs.

Other measures implemented include cutting the amount of ice taken on board a flight, and reducing the weight of trolleys and seats.

In the past Ryanair has floated many controversial cost-saving ideas.

One of them was to remove conventional seating and offering air passengers just standing room.

Instead of being allocated a seat, Ryanair travellers would perch on a narrow shelf and lean against a flat padded backboard.

A Boeing 737-800 would be fitted out with 15 rows of seats and 10 rows of standing berths and passengers would be restrained with a strap stretching over their shoulder, the budget airline said.

Michael
 O'Leary, the budget airline's chief executive, said the refitted 
airplane would resemble a classic London Underground train with its 
distinctive ball-and-strap fittings.

The Ryanair boss said seated passengers 
would be charged £25 per ticket and standing customers would pay between 
£1 and £5 for their fares - it would boost the average 
capacity of a flight from 189 passengers to 230.

But in February, Ryanair announced that an unnamed regulator had halted its plan, by refusing an application for test flights.

Mr O'Leary said he was undeterred by the refusal and declared 'I think ultimately it would happen.'

The airline also faced an outcry in 2009 over plans to charge passengers a pound to visit the plane toilet, in a bid to limit loo facilities on the aircraft and 
replace them with extra seats.

The plans to ‘charge a pound to spend a penny’ have now been dropped, Mr O’Leary said last year.

Ryanair
 has also suggested it could put passengers in the hull, in bunks and
 has called for flights with only one pilot instead of the usual two.

But it's not just Ryanair that is slimming down its aircraft as much as possible.

Other
 airlines have replaced glasswear in the first class cabins with 
plastic, reduced the weight of metal cutlery and some have removed seat 
phones, magazine racks and even rubbish bins.

American
 Airlines went one step further in the 1980s, when then-chief executive 
Robert Crandall claimed he had saved the airline $40,000 by taking out 
one olive from every salad served in first class.

More recently, in 2009, Japanese airline All Nippon Airways, started asking passengers to go to the toilet before boarding in a bid to reduce carbon emissions.

Ryanair
 says that while it is trying to save on fuel, it will not pass on fuel 
surcharges to customers as happens with other airlines such as BA and 
Virgin Atlantic.

'Fuel
 is an integral part of the fare – you can’t fly passengers anywhere 
without it,' said Mr McNamara. 'We would rather make cost reductions and
 charge passengers for other services.'
