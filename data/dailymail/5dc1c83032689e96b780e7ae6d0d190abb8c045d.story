You can never quite be sure what the sea will throw up.

But if you happen to be a surfer who combines athletic feats on a board with a skilled touch in the studio, then any ocean detritus can be transformed into something dramatic.

It came from the deep: Skeleton Sea create artworks with rubbish washed up on beaches - including the fragments of rubber used to create this tiger shark

Hugely inventive: The three artists have also created this giant fish using scraps of rusted metal - such as tin lids and compressed drinks cans

Artists João Parrinha, Luis de Dios and Xandi Kreuzeder – who collectively work as Skeleton Sea (www.skeletonsea.com) – have made a name for themselves through the sculptures and installations they make using items they find on beaches and in the waves.

These shoes were made for... being recycled into an elaborate sculpture: Another of the art collective's concoctions was made using lost flip-flops

Taking on human form: Skeleton Sea have also created smaller artworks - including these human-esque figures fashioned from discarded rubber gloves

Surfers as much as they are creative types, the trio started out simply by collecting rubbish and washed-up materials they encountered while riding oceanic breakers – old lifebuoys separated from ships, shards of metal from wrecked vessels, scraps of rubber, chunks of wood, floating plastics and other myriad non-biodegradable substances.

But they soon found that they could turn this unsightly trash into rather more beautiful objects – and make a pertinent point while doing so.

Making a point: 'Roxy Mermaid' comes with an environmental message based upon the importance of keeping the oceans clean

Making the most of it: The artists are also surfers, and were inspired to begin creating sculptures using the detritus they found while boarding

By turning burst tyres, clusters of electric cables, dead car parts and strips of blackened metal into marine creatures such as life-sized sharks – complete with teeth and fins – they have been able to stress the importance of keeping the oceans free of pollution.

Other creations have included giant fish constructed from can lids, soft-drink containers and lost flip-flops – and human figures shaped out of discarded rubber gloves.

On display: The sculptures have been put on show in several parts of Europe, and were recently exhibited at Surfers Lodge Peniche, in Portugal

‘Roxy Mermaid’, meanwhile, sees an iconic female figure of oceanic legend perched, in multi-coloured fashion, on a large ball of abandoned fishing nets.

It was devised by Kreuzeder from flotsam picked up on various beaches in Africa and south-east Asia.

‘The creative idea behind the work was to contrast the beauty of this well-known mythical being with the ugly truth that lurks beneath the surface of our oceans,’ he says.

‘Roxy Mermaid represents another way for us to spread the collective’s environmental message based around the importance of keeping our oceans clean.’

Odds and ends: Some of Skeleton Sea's creations have a macabre edge, including this skull constructed from, among other things, broken meshing and plastic bottles

Making faces: The exhibits drew a crowd when they went on display over Easter - and will return to Surfers Lodge Peniche for a second showing in September

The trio have exhibited their work in Spain – in Valencia, and in the Basque region in the north of the country – and in Biarritz, in western France.

They have also held workshops at Msambweni, just south of Mombasa on Kenya’s Indian Ocean coast – with the aim of promoting the welfare of the region’s turtle population, plus the concept of clean beaches.

Most recently, the sculptures went on show at Surfers Lodge Peniche (www.surferslodgepeniche.com) – a beachside retreat in the small Portuguese town of Peniche, which nestles on its own circular peninsula, some 60 miles north of Lisbon.

Things that the everyday folks leave behind: Suitable materials for making these artworks are easy to source, with items regularly washing up on beaches

Things to make and do: The artists also hold workshops where children and other interested parties can learn to make art from beach trash

The town is a neat fit for such an exhibition, assailed on all sides by Atlantic waves – while the hotel’s roof terrace proved to be a suitable gallery for their display.

The exhibition was held over Easter, but will return for a second edition in September.
