Christopher Tappin last night revealed he had to endure nights of ‘psychotic screams’ during his time in prison.

The retired British businessman, who was held in a New Mexico prison for two months on arms dealing charges, said he was locked in a cell near inmates with psychological problems who kept him awake every night.

Mr Tappin, 65, from Orpington, Kent, said: ‘The night screams were horrific. When I was in isolation, in the prison’s special housing unit, the screams would start every night.

‘During the day the inmates were in a narcotic-induced stupor because they dosed them up with drugs, but by the night time the drugs had worn off.

‘I barely slept while I was in isolation. There were constantly doors slamming, these screams were ringing out and the lights were on 24 hours a day. It was awful.’

Mr Tappin, former president of Kent Golf Union, was extradited to the US in February after losing a protracted legal battle before the High Court.

He was released on bail on Wednesday after two months behind bars at the maximum-security prison.

He was held in the Otero County Detention Centre, which houses accused murderers, and was forced to wear a prison jumpsuit and shackles. He originally spent 23 hours a day locked up in isolation before being moved to a shared cell

The businessman was forced to surrender his British passport to US Marshals when he was extradited and must remain in Texas while he awaits his trial. Under his bail conditions, he is living with Dan Cogdell, one of his US lawyers, at his family home in Montgomery County, near Houston.

His new home is a far cry from the isolated fortress surrounded by towering razor-wire fences, security lights and cameras. Mr Cogdell lives in a £620,000 mansion which boasts a pool and is nestled inside a luxurious gated community.

Yesterday Mr Tappin spoke to his wife, Elaine, for the first time since being released from jail. He described the phone call as ‘emotional’ and said she cried when she heard his voice.

‘I spoke to her from jail a few times but it was nice to speak to her in my own time and for as long as I wanted, rather than being restricted to phone cards and pay phones,’ he said.

‘She was hoping to come and visit me next week, but she has a virus – a coldy flu-type thing – and she’s been told she can’t fly.

‘It’s a shame, but my son, Neil, is still coming so it will be great to see him. We’re planning to play a round of golf or two during his visit.’

He said Mr Cogdell’s wife, Robin, cooked him a traditional British meal for his first post-jail dinner.

‘Robin prepared us fish and chips. It was very good,’ he said. ‘I’d eaten breakfast at 9.30am on Wednesday and I hadn’t had anything in between so I was starving.

‘I had a glass of Boddington’s with the fish and chips. It was wonderful.’

Mr Tappin has to wear an electronic tag at all times to track his movements and his travel will be limited to within two Texas counties as well as the border city of El Paso for court appearances. The grey-haired businessman, who uses a walking stick, faces up to 35 years in jail if convicted of trying to sell batteries for surface-to-air missiles to Iran. He denies the charges.

His case has fuelled the row over the fairness of the extradition treaty between the UK and the US. Attorney General Dominic Grieve said Mr Tappin’s extradition highlighted problems with the treaty which were not ‘readily curable’, warning that many Britons were left uneasy when faced with the seemingly harsh and disproportionate sentences in the American justice system.

Other critics of the 2003 treaty, including Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, have deemed it ‘one-sided’.
