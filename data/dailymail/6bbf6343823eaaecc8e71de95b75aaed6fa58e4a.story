Friends and family members of headless torso murder victim George Gerbic received what they thought were emails from him in the months after his charred remains were discovered on a Queensland roadside.

George Gerbic, from Tanawha on the Sunshine Coast, was formally identified by police as the victim of the horrific murder earlier this month, almost a year after his remains were first found.

In the 10 months following the grisly discovery, emails were allegedly sent from Mr Gerbic's personal account which gave his friends and relatives the impression he was still alive, The Courier-Mail reported.

Ms Williams, who lived with Mr Gerbic in the Tanawha home, faced Maroochydore Magistrates Court on July 18 charged with his murder

Police discovered Mr Gerbic's headless remains, with arms severed at the elbows and nothing left below the rib cage, at Cedar Point, near Gympie, last September.

A 56-year-old named Lindy Yvonne Williams, who lived with Mr Gerbic in the Tanawha home, faced Maroochydore Magistrates Court on July 18 charged with his murder.

She is also charged with interfering with a corpse.

Their home was turned into a crime scene on July 17 - the same day police said they had identified the man and were questioning a woman.

Ms Williams did not apply for bail and is due to appear again in court for a committal mention on September 1.

The torso, found on Cedar Pocket Rd, pictured, in September 2013, was able to be identified when police found the the hypertension drug Irbesartan and Quinine in the body's system

Queensland police have been investigating the murder since last September

Detective Inspector Bruce McNab revealed a small trace of blood pressure medication in the remains had led to the identification of Mr Gerbic.

In April police revealed they had detected traces of a drug called Irbesartan in the remains.

Doorknocking of prescription users in the area - following an exhaustive search of pharmacy records - had led police to the man's property.'

There's been a lot of technology used but also a lot of good old-fashioned detective work, wearing out your shoe leather,' Det Insp McNab said.

Tributes have been paid to a 'well liked and much respected' former president of Coolum Football Club.

A tribute statement to the 66-year-old read: 'As a club and for those of us who knew him individually, we are incredibly sorry to hear of his tragic death and our hearts and deepest condolences are with his family and close friends at this sad time.

'As a mark of respect to George and the Gerbic family our club's senior players will be wearing a black armband for this weekends games and will be observing a minutes silence prior to kick off of their respective fixtures.'

The message finished: 'Rest in peace George.'
