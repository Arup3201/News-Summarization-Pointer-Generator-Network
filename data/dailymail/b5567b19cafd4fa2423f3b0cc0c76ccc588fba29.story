Gareth Barry has escaped a broken leg but could have suffered ankle-ligament damage during the 1-1 draw at Sunderland.

The former England midfielder was forced off after just 13 minutes when Jordi Gomez landed his studs on his ankle.

There were fears that Barry had broken his tibia, but boss Roberto Martinez said: ‘I am happy to confirm that it's not the broken leg we were worried about. There is damage to the ankle we must assess.

Barry is renowned for being an honest player who would not go down unless the problem was serious

‘The tackle [from Gomez] is an early one in the game, there is a lot of energy and it is unfortunate. As he is falling, he stretches his leg. There is no intention whatsoever – it is just unfortunate.

‘Gareth Barry is not the sort of player to simulate. We knew he was in trouble the minute he went down.’ 

Meanwhile, the Blues will also assess midfielder James McCarthy, who indicated a problem with his hamstring late in the game.

‘We are going to assess James,’ said Martinez. 

‘He was feeling his hamstring towards the end of the game but he wanted to stay on the pitch because we had used all three subs. 

‘It is a bit of a concern because he had the same injury a few weeks back when he missed the game against Manchester United and it is in that area. We are hoping that it is more fatigue than a soft tissue problem.’
