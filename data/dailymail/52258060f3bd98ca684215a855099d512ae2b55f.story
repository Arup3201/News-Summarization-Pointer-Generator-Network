Moors murderer Myra Hindley was so addicted to Valium that she wrote to the Home Secretary begging him not to cut her supply.

Secret letters published today for the first time reveal the dark chapter in the killer's final years behind bars.

The notes also show how Hindley asked for permission to be hypnotised so that she could remember the location of the grave of her final victim - 12-year-old Keith Bennett.

Hooked on drug: Moors murderer Myra Hindley was so addicted to Valium that she wrote to the Home Secretary Douglas Hurd in 1989 begging him not to cut her supply

In 1987 the child killer turned to doctors for help after police took her to the scene of her murders.

But officials later became concerned with her dependence on Valium - and described her appearance as 'doped up to the eyeballs'.

Her daily prescription to the drug was cut two years later - prompting her to write a six-page letter to the then Tory Home Secretary Douglas Hurd - saying how Valium helped to relieve 'pressure and trauma' in prison.

'I have used it many times into my sentence, particularly when there have been major crises,' she wrote, 23 years into her life term.

She adds: 'Since I'm not asking to be released there's no particular point in preserving my body for a healthy and ripe old age in prison.

She goes on to describe how Valium is the only thing that kept her going in jail.

Uncovered: Her letter was marked and sealed until 2072 but was among papers released when she died in Kent's Cookham Wood Prison in 2002. It was only recently unearthed by a Sheffield University academic

Read killer's letter: Home secretary in 1989, Douglas Hurd, received a six-page handwritten letter from child murderer Myra Hindley asking she be supplied with Valium again

The killer, who murdered at least five children with evil lover Ian Brady, even moaned about 'a series of upsetting and disturbing letters' from Winnie Johnson - mother of Keith Bennett, who was still missing at the time.

The letter to Lord Hurd was dated March 1 1989 and hypocritically appealed to the home secretary to end Mrs Johnson's ordeal.

She asked Lord Hurd if she could be hypnotised to help locate the murdered boy's remains.

But the former home secretary was warned that evidence obtained might not be admissible in law and could lead to other undesirable requests.

He also did not believe the hypnosis would work and rejected her request.

Later the government went back on the decision - but by that point Hindley was too ill for any form of therapy.

Her letter was marked and sealed until 2072 but was among papers released when she died aged 60 in Kent's Cookham Wood Prison in 2002.

The prison confirmed she used Valium in 1987 and 1988, when her father Bob died. 

Dr Tom Clark, a Sheffield University academic researching a book about Hindley, recently uncovered the letters amid a pile of jumbled documents at the National Archives in London.

Hindley's records are said to fill 20ft of shelves.

Wrote to Hindley: Winnie Johnson, the mother of murdered 12-year-old Keith Bennett, wrote to Hindley in prison asking her to tell police where to find the remains of her son. She died in 2012

Dr Clark told The Sun on Sunday: 'They give a fascinating insight into Hindley's last few years and her reliance on Valium. At no stage does she show remorse - quite the opposite.'

Speaking to the Sunday Express, he adds: 'Like many of Hindley's writings, the the letter totally ignores the gravity of what she did.

'The tone is quite strange. It is quite self-righteous, as if someone else has committed the murders and she was helping solve them.'
