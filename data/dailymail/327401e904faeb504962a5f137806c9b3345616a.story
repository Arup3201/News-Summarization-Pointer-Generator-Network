Morgan Schneiderlin has reiterated his desire to leave Southampton this summer should the club fail to qualify for the Champions League.

The combative midfielder has previously been linked to north London rivals Arsenal and Tottenham, with the Frenchman handing in a transfer request at the start of the 2014-15 season.

Although Ronald Koeman's side are still in the hunt for a top-four finish, they face a tough battle with the likes of Manchester United for the position and Schneiderlin has claimed he doesn't want to be watching elite European football from home next season.

Schneiderlin told L'Equipe: 'In August, I wanted to take a move but the club had lost too many players to agree to sell me,' he is quoted as saying in French newspaper L'Equipe.

'Since then I have had discussions with the leaders and I want to play at the highest level: it is important at 25 years old to finally know the Champions League.

'Given that, late in the season, Southampton may qualify for the Champions League and I can stay, who knows. I have no desire to be in front of my TV on Tuesday and Wednesday.' 

Schneiderlin also hit out at Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas for being a wind-up merchant

Schneiderlin has also hit out at Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas for winding him up during Southampton's 1-1 Premier League draw with Jose Mourinho's side last December.

He was sent-off for a late challenge on Fabregas and has blamed the former Arsenal man for 'putting in small hits' throughout the match.

He added: 'Once this year against Chelsea I was angry with Cesc Fabregas because he wouldn't stop talking, putting in small hits. It made me lose my composure and, in a move, I forgot that I already had a warning.'
