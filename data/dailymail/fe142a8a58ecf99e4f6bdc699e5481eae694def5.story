TV presenter Paula Yates had a mission for a long time to 'get' Michael Hutchence - and the Australian singer could not get out of her web - a former member of the rock band INXS said on Sunday.

Speaking during an interview of surviving INXS members on Australia's Channel 7, the band's guitarist and saxaphonist Kirk Pengilly joined with other members in telling how Hutchence changed after being punched to the ground while out with model girlfriend Helena Christensen.

He lost his sense of taste and smell, said bassist Garry Gary Beers, but it was Hutchence's relationship with Miss Yates that changed him the most.

Pengilly revealed what he said had been a secret he had kept for all the years since Hutchence had died at the age of 37 in 1997.

He said: 'Just prior to his death, about a week or so, what he told me he had a plan in place to basically split up with Paula and so, what can I say?

'That's what he told me. I don't know, it's all very personal stuff, I don't want to dwell on it.'

Tim Farris, the band's guitarist, told how Hutchence took a swing at him on one occasion after he and Miss Yates had a daughter, Tiger Lily.

As they told of their shock at the death of Hutchence in a Sydney hotel room after he had had dinner with his father and stepmother, Pengilly recalled a strange dream he had had.

He said: ‘I was in a field, it was moonlight and Michael came to me as an owl and said "Everything's fine, I'm finally free, don't worry, I'm happy".'

The surviving band members pulled no punches in the special interview, with Tim Farriss saying Michael would have 'hated' the thought of Tiger Lily being brought up by Bob Geldof.

The pair made no bones about the fact that they disliked each other, with Hutchence even going so far as to call Geldof 'evil'.

Happy family? The surviving members of INXS have alleged that Paula Yates, seen with Hutchence and her daughters in 1996, was determined to 'get' him - while Hutchence had planned to end their relationship

Farriss said that the thought of Geldof being a sole parent of Tiger Lily would have been anathema to Hutchence.

He said: 'Michael hated Bob in the end so much, to think that he would end up as the sole parent of Tiger Lily would have been the most horrific thing he could have imagined. But luckily for Tiger she had Bob at the end.'

It was the child custody battle between Yates and Geldof that consumed Hutchence in the last days of his life, so much so that the coroner's report into his death - in a room at Sydney’s Ritz-Carlton hotel - recorded that Hutchence called Geldof and abused him for not letting Yates bring her children to Australia.

Custody battle: Yates and Bob Geldof, seen together in 1991, were involved in a bitter court battle over their children when Hutchence died in 1997

A year later Yates died from an apparent overdose, leaving Geldof to bring up Tiger Lily as his own.

Farriss came across in the interview as having a strong paternal instinct for Tiger Lily.

A father of two sons, he said that he had not kept in contact with Michael's daughter but would receive a reunion 'with open arms'.

He said: 'She’s the daughter I never had. It’s my goal in life is to see this beautiful young woman and to tell her, face-to-face, what a wonderful man her father really was. How much he is loved and missed.’
