Tragic: Greg Bear, 17, had been examined by three doctors and a paramedic six days before he died of septicaemia. They all dismissed his condition

A teenager died of blood poisoning after medics dismissed his illness as flu four times, an inquest has heard.

Greg Bear, 17, had been examined by three doctors and a paramedic six days before he died.

After he began coughing up blood - a key symptom of  septicaemia - his mother Elizabeth begged one paramedic to rush the teen to hospital.

But she was told his condition was not bad enough and that he should take some paracetamol.

The paramedic added: 'If I was to take every 17-year-old boy coughing up blood, the system would grind to a halt,' the inquest heard.

Mr Bear's condition worsened the following day. His mother told the hearing that when she phoned trainee GP Dr Christopher Cope for help he also dismissed her concerns.

Hours later Mrs Bear dialled 999 and the teen was finally taken to Kings Mill Hospital in Nottingham on December 21, 2010, by another paramedic. He died the following morning.

Mr Bear, from Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottingham, had first gone to his GP, Dr Christopher Woods, on December 16 - the day after his 17th birthday - and was told he had a 'nasty cold, possibly flu'. 

Giving evidence at the inquest, Dr Woods said he had received a message 
stating Mrs Bear was concerned her son 'was burning up' and was 'worried about 
swine flu'.

He said: 'My initial concern was that this could it be something such as
meningitis, so I asked did he have a rash, which Mrs Bear replied that 
he didn't. 

'Then she went on to explain that he didn't have any pain in his neck. 
That reassured me that it was much less likely to be meningitis.'

Days later he developed 
'uncomplicated septicaemia' which could have been cured by a course of 
antibiotics, but was again wrongly diagnosed with flu.

Mrs Bear told Nottingham Coroners Court she had been left frustrated by the medics who examined her son.

The day before he died she said it was clear her son needed urgent medical attention.

'Greg was red and had pain in his groin and bottom, he was burning up, he was coughing up blood and bile,' Mrs Bear said.

Death: The teen was finally taken to Kings Mill Hospital in Nottingham on December 21, 2010, but died the following morning

'He was in excruciating agony, his fingers were blue, his face was red and hot. We were told to keep giving him paracetamol and to come in if he got worse.

'I thought I wasn’t getting anywhere, I was left not knowing what to do.'

The inquest heard Dr Cope had told Mrs Bear to bring her son
into the surgery but failed to record the information about his 
deteriorating condition.

Dr Cope, who is now fully qualified, told the inquest: 'I didn't appreciate the blue tinge to him while talking to Mrs Bear.

'I cannot for the life of me understand why. I deeply regret not picking that up.'

Recording a narrative verdict, deputy coroner for Nottinghamshire, Heidi Connor, said: 'To Greg’s family there aren’t enough words in the dictionary to describe what you have been through.

'As a family your dignity throughout these proceedings has been nothing short of inspirational. You have done your son proud, if he was anything like his parents, he must have been quite a lad.'

After the hearing Mr Bear's parents Gary and Elizabeth said they hoped lessons had been learned.

'Hopefully we can take something positive away from the tragic catalogue of errors which took our son away from us,'” Mr Bear's father said.

'We hope medical professionals can become better at spotting the early signs of sepsis so it can be spotted early and lives can be saved. We don’t want anyone to go through what we’ve been through.

'Something as simple as asking when someone last passed urine can save lives. If it’s a long time it’s more than likely they need to go to hospital. Greg was inspirational to his friends. He was well liked by everyone. He would literally do anything for anyone.'

Dr Jim Grey, medical director of East Midlands Ambulance Service, said all staff have been given new guidance on recognising early signs of Sepsis.
