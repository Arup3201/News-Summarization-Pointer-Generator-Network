Women authors have scooped all five categories in the Costa Book Awards for the first time in its history.

The all-female shortlist for the overall prize of book of the year includes Hilary Mantel, who won the best novel category for Bring Up The Bodies, the second book in her planned trilogy set in the Tudor court.

It is the second major award for the novel, which also won Miss Mantel her second Booker Prize. She previously won the award in 2009 for Wolf Hall, the first book in the trilogy.

Among the other works shortlisted is a graphic novel about James Joyce’s daughter, Dotter of her Father’s Eyes, by husband and wife Mary and Bryan Talbot, which won the biography category, and children’s book Maggot Moon by dyslexic writer Sally Gardiner.

The shortlist is completed by poet Kathleen Jamie’s collection The Overhaul and Francesca Segal’s first novel, The Innocents.

Miss Mantel is the 5/4 favourite to win the overall prize, according to bookmakers William Hill, followed by Miss Segal at 3/1.

The winner will be announced in a ceremony later this month.

All five shortlisted writers receive £5,000 each with the overall winner picking up a main prize of £30,000.

The judging panel, chaired by Dame Jenni Murray, includes actress Jenny Agutter and broadcaster Katie Derham.

Costa managing director Christopher Rogers said: ‘We’re very proud to be announcing such a diverse and excellent collection of books which we know people will enjoy reading.’

Last year’s winner was historical novel Pure by Andrew Miller.
