One of the consequences of living in our universe - where space and time are linked - is that as you travel faster, time can appear to speed up.

This theory, known as time dilation, was first postulated by Albert Einstein in the early 20th century, and has since been proven in a number of experiments.

But, considering that Earth is moving through space, does that mean time for us is travelling faster than someone who is stationary? The answer is 'yes', and by about one second per week. But why?

A US physicist answered a question regarding time dilation on Earth (satellite image shown). They said our motion around the sun and galaxy causes time to slow. And even on the planet, the spin of Earth changes time for people. Shown is an image of Earth taken by Nasa's Suomi NPP satellite in 2012

This question was posed on the website Ask a Mathematician, and answered by their resident expert known as ‘The Physicist’.

The ‘twin paradox’ is a thought experiment proposed by Albert Einstein in the early 20th Century.

It is derived from his theory of special relativity.

Einstein suggests that the faster you travel, the slower you move through time.

If one twin travelled in a spaceship near the speed of light, they would return home considerably younger than their sibling under laws of special relativity.

Known as ‘time dilation,’ this was proven in 1971 with the Hafele-Keating experiment.

Atomic clocks were set to the same time and then sent in different directions around the world in separate planes.

The clocks were found to have ticked differently, proving special relativity. 

The expert says that the spin of Earth, its orbit around the sun and the solar system’s motion around the Milky Way all combine to decrease the time we experience on Earth.

This is compared to someone who was stationary as compared to moving at our planet’s speed.

On Earth itself, the effects of the planet’s spin on time are not too extreme - although they can be calculated.

At the poles on Earth’s rotation axis, there is no velocity from the spin of the planet - but at the equator, it’s about 0.3 miles (0.5km) per second.

‘The difference in time experienced between people living in Longyearbyen (near the pole) and people living in Ecuador (near the equator) is about one part in a trillion,’ explained The Physicist.

This ‘gives those proud Norwegians an extra second every 25 thousand years,’ they added.

‘Don’t spend that second all in one place, Norwegians.’

Around the sun, Earth is moving about 18.5 miles (30km) per second, which causes us to lose even more time that we would experience compared to someone moving slower.

Earth's motion around the sun, as it orbits within the solar system (illustration shown) is about 18.5 miles (30km) per second, which causes us to lose even more time compared to someone who is stationary

Our motion around the galaxy, meanwhile, which is about 125 miles (200km) per second, equates to a gain in time of about one part in every 4.5 million, which is an extra second every couple of months.

And just being in the Milky Way itself, which is travelling through space, also adds some extra time to our everyday life. 

By being in the galaxy and spinning around its centre, we lose roughly a second every week over someone who was floating out in intergalactic space.

In an email The Physicist, who remains anonymous, told MailOnline  added that gravitational time dilation also had an effect, caused by the presence of gravity. 

It should be noted, though, that time is relative and there is no one true clock for the universe.

This means that no one experiences the 'correct' time, but each person merely has their own frame of reference to space-time. 

The biggest effect on the time we experience is the motion around the galaxy, which is about 125 miles (200km) per second, and the movement of the Milky Way itself (shown from Earth). With everything combined, we gain approximately an extra second every week, compared to someone who is stationary in the universe
