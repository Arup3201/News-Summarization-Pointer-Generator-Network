The jurors who found Dr Kermit Gosnell guilty of killing three babies at his grimy abortion clinic have revealed they believe he was motivated by greed as he intentionally killed the newborns.

Speaking publicly for the first time since the verdict was reached on Monday following a two-month trial, three jurors spoke about why they agreed to convict him on three murder charges.

Their press conference came after he was handed a third life sentence on Wednesday. He was also sentenced to up to five years for the involuntary manslaughter death of Karnamaya Mongar, 41, who died from a drug overdose after going to him for an abortion.

One juror, David Misko, 27, said they had agreed to convict him because they believe the murders - which were carried out when Gosnell snipped the babies' necks with scissors - were premeditated.

'It was business as usual,' Misko said. 'He snipped the necks no matter what happened.'

Misko added that he judged Gosnell for not speaking in the trial: 'He just sat there and smirked for eight weeks,' he said.

Another juror, Joseph Carroll, added that most the group also felt that the doctor had been driven by greed rather than compassion for the mothers or their babies.

'The services... it was like a machine,' he told reporters outside the justice center in Philadelphia. 'They came in, he gave them a service, and bam, the women were gone.'

Juror Sarah Glinski added that the hardest part of the trial was having to see the images of the lifeless children.

Decision makers: Misko, left, said they agreed the killings had been premeditated and would go ahead whether the babies were big enough to live or not. Carroll, right, said Gosnell was driven by greed

Disturbed: Glinski said she thinks Gosnell started with good intentions then 'something went wrong'

Media scrum: It is the first time the jurors have spoken out in the trial, which started two months ago

'Seeing those photos and just having to say to myself, "This did happen to those kids. There were children that died at the hands of this man." That was what was hard for me. To admit that that kind of evil exists in this world,' she said.

But she added that she did not believe the doctor started out with the same intentions when he began carrying out abortions for low-income women years ago.

'He was an abortion doctor who tried to help people who didn't have the money,' she said. 'I think somewhere, something, went wrong in his mind.'

Carroll said they also talked about whether the mothers were to blame and he said that he believed some should have been charged because their babies were past the legal threshold.

Gosnell was spared the death penalty on Tuesday after striking a plea deal; he will serve his life sentences consecutively and without parole after giving up his right to appeal.

Frightening: The jurors said they thought that Gosnell had smirked throughout his murder trial

Gosnell was pictured smiling as 
he was led from the court on Monday. The jury found he was guilty of murder in the deaths of babies, who had been named A, C and D for the purpose of the trial.

In
earlier testimony, the court heard how a clinic employee had 
photographed Baby A after Dr Gosnell had joked: 'He's big enough to walk
you to the bus stop.'

Clinic
workers also testified that they had seen Baby C, a little girl, move 
her arm before her neck was snipped, bringing about her death.

And
Baby D was born in the clinic's bathroom and was seen struggling to get
out of the toilet before a worker also snipped their spine.

He was found not guilty in the death of Baby E, who workers had said let out a single cry before the neck was snipped.

Dr Gosnell's attorney Jack McMahon said they were 'disappointed' with the verdict.

Defense: Gosnell's lawyer Jack McMahon speaks following the verdict, which he called 'disappointing'

'We put on a vigorous defense,' he told CNN. 'We think it went well in the courtroom... but we respect the jury's verdict.

'Obviously
the jury took their job very seriously... By the nature of the verdict -
both guilty and not guilty verdicts - they obviously thought about the 
evidence. They were conscientious.'

The jury heard five weeks of testimony before breaking for deliberation on April 30.

As prosecutors gave their closing 
arguments in Gosnell's trial two weeks ago, Assistant District Attorney
Ed Cameron turned to Gosnell and asked 'Are you human?' - but the 
doctor simply laughed.

'My dog was treated better than those babies and women,' Cameron said.

He added that Mongar's death was the result of Gosnell's 'assembly line' treatment of patients.

The defense questioned testimony from
staffers who said they had seen babies move, cry or breathe, claiming 
that the babies had died from abortion-inducing drugs rather than 
severed spines.

After weeks of hearing from former employees, Gosnell did not testify, and his lawyer, John McMahon, called no witnesses in his defense.

He said that the doctor had simply provided
desperate, often poor woman with a solution, and he branded 
prosecutors 'racist' for attacking Gosnell, who is 
black and whose patients were largely minorities.

McMahon argued that each worker had testified to seeing only a single movement or breath.

'These
are not the movements of a live child,' McMahon said. 'There is not one
piece - not one - of objective, scientific evidence that anyone was 
born alive.'

But the prosecutor questioned why 
else Gosnell and his staff would 'snip' babies if they were not born 
alive. The brains were intact, so it was not done to make the delivery 
easier, he said.

Gosnell's grisly business was 
discovered more than two years ago when authorities went to investigate 
prescription drug trafficking at Gosnell's clinic in a low-income area 
of West Philadelphia.

Instead, they came across blood-splattered operating tables, bags of body parts, unsanitary instruments, jars of severed feet and the stink of cat urine, according to a 2011 grand jury report.

The
tiny fetuses and many of their bodyparts were piled high throughout 
Gosnellâ€™s clinic in cabinets and freezers, in plastic bags, bottles, 
even cat-food containers.

The report added that dozens of women were injured at 
Gosnell's clinic over the past 30 years, calling it a 'house of 
horrors'.

Some
left with torn wombs or bowels, some with venereal disease contracted 
through the reuse of non-sterilized equipment, and some left with fetal 
remains still inside them, the report alleged.

Employees
at the clinic confirmed that babies were often expelled from their 
mothers into the toilet. On at least one occasion the toilet had to be 
removed from the floor to 'get the fetuses out of the pipes.'

Discarded: Bags stashed with body parts, pictured, were also found in the Philadelphia clinic

Operating table: Women were often given such high doses of drugs that they gave birth in the toilet

Former
staffers added that patients received heavy sedatives and 
painkillers from untrained workers while Gosnell was offsite, and were 
then left in waiting rooms for hours, often unattended.

Gosnell
has been in jail since his January 2011 arrest.

The business apparently made Gosnell a fortune over the 30 years he was carrying out abortions.

Authorities said that the medical practice netted him about $1.8 million a year, and found $250,000 hidden in a bedroom when they searched one of his numerous properties.

Eight other defendants 
have pleaded guilty to a variety of charges and are awaiting sentencing. They include Gosnell's wife, Pearl, a cosmetologist who helped perform abortions.
