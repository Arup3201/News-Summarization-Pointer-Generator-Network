The alleged video of Toronto mayor Rob Ford smoking crack cocaine has apparently ‘gone’ according to one of the men involved in attempts to purchase it.

News website Gawker launched a campaign last month to raise $200,000 from readers to purchase the footage from its Canadian proprietor.

Ford was consumed by a 
sea of media speculation after rumors of the video surfaced last month, 
but he adamantly claimed that it didn't exist.

Off the hook? The alleged video of Toronto Mayor Rob Ford smoking crack has apparently disappeared

The website opened a ‘Crackstarter’ page on crowdfunding platform Indiegogo and had raised the money by May 27, but days earlier had lost contact with the video’s owner.

A still image - allegedly taken from the video - purportedly shows Ford with three men.

On Tuesday Gawker Editor-in-Chief John Cook confirmed that the video might really be ‘gone’ after he received a call from a man who had been acting as his intermediary with the owner of the tape.

‘The owner was trying to sell the video,’ wrote Cook, ‘but he apparently didn't want or anticipate the media circus that erupted after the story broke.’

Scandal: A still image allegedly taken from the video given to the Globe and Mail and Gawker.com purportedly shows Ford with two men, one of whom is believed to have been murdered over the video

It was Ford who on May 16 claimed to have seen video of Ford smoking a crack pipe, which he said belonged to drug dealer linked to Ford.

The owner of the video had been identified as a Somali man by the Toronto Star and according to Cook the man was also being pressurized by Toronto's ethnic Somali community to make the video disappear.

Cook had been dealing with an intermediary who called him last Friday to say he had finally heard from the owner.

Cook wrote: ‘And his message was: "It's gone. Leave me alone." It was, the intermediary told me, a short conversation.’

If the video 
fails to turn up 'soon,' Gawker will donate the money raised to 'a Canadian nonprofit that 
addresses substance abuse issues.'

Rumors: Toronto Mayor Rob Ford (right) said on a talk show hosted by his brother City Councillor Doug Ford that a video of him allegedly smoking crack cocaine does not exist

On May 24, Ford denied during a press
conference that he smoked crack cocaine, and insisted that video of him
engaging in the illicit act did not exist.

However,
the Toronto Star reported that Ford had earlier met with staffers to 
assure them such a video was no cause for concern because "he knew where
it was."

Speaking two weeks ago on a weekly radio show that he hosts with his brother Doug Ford, a city council member, Rob Ford reiterated that the allegations were ridiculous, but he didn't say whether he has ever used crack.

Reports on Gawker and in the Toronto Star claimed the videoo was taken by men who said they had sold the drug to Ford.

The Star reported that two 
journalists had watched a video that appears to show Ford, sitting in a 
chair, inhaling from what appears to be a glass crack pipe.

The Star said it did not obtain the video or pay to watch it.

Fundraising: On Monday, Gawker successfully raised more than $200,000 in its 'Crackstarter' campaign to purchase the video

When asked by a caller to the show if it was him in the video, Ford responded: 'Number one: There's no video, so that's all I can say. You can't comment on something that doesn't exist.'

Ford called the allegations false and said good journalists are 'few and far between'.

'A bunch of maggots," Ford said, quickly adding that he shouldn't have said that. In a press conference today, he apologized for the remark.

Some critics called on Ford to step down, but he has vowed to seek re-election next year.

'I'll be the first putting my name on that ballot,' he said.

Doug Ford is also facing drug allegations after another leading Canadian newspaper published Saturday the results of what it called a lengthy investigation into the Ford family's past that revealed 'a portrait of a family once deeply immersed in the illegal drug scene'.

The Globe and Mail, citing anonymous sources who were involved in the drug trade, alleged that the mayor's older brother sold hashish for several years in the 1980s in the Toronto suburb of Etobicoke, where the family grew up. Doug Ford, 48, is an influential adviser to the mayor.

'I was not a dealer of hashish in the 1980s,' Doug Ford said on Sunday's radio show.

The mayor has been embroiled in almost weekly controversies about his behavior since being elected in 2010.

The Toronto Star reported earlier this year that the mayor was asked to leave a gala fundraiser for wounded Canadian soldiers because he appeared intoxicated.

During his campaign for mayor, Rob Ford vehemently denied a 1999 arrest for marijuana possession in Florida, but later acknowledged it was true after he was presented with evidence.

He pleaded guilty to driving under the influence and failing to give a breath sample to police.

While in office, he has been accused of flouting conflict of interest rules and making obscene gestures at residents from his car.

The controversy has drawn comparisons to the 1990 arrest of then-Washington Mayor Marion Barry, who was videotaped smoking crack cocaine in a hotel room during an FBI sting operation.

Barry served six months in federal prison on a misdemeanor drug possession conviction but later won a fourth term as mayor in 1994.
