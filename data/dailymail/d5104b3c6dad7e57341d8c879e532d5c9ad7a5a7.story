U.S. president Barack Obama said both he and wife Michelle are 'deeply saddened' by the damage wrought by Typhoon Haiyan in the Phillipines this weekend.

In a written statement released on Sunday, Obama also said 'But I know the incredible 
resiliency of the Philippine people, and I am confident that the spirit 
of Bayanihan will see you through this tragedy.'

Obama also wrote the U.S. is 'already providing significant humanitarian efforts' and is ready to further assist the Philippine government.

Haiyan struck the eastern seaboard of the Philippines on Friday and quickly barreled across its central islands, packing winds that gusted up to 170 miles per hour.

To aid in the recovery effort, a team of approximately 90 U.S. Marines and sailors headed to the Philippines on Sunday. They were part of the first wave of promised U.S. military assistance.

The order was made this weekend by Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel. Hagel ordered U.S. military's Pacific Command to assist with search and rescue operations and provide air support in the wake of super typhoon Haiyan.

One of the most powerful storms ever recorded, Haiyan was a maximum category-five storm with ground winds of up to 235mph. Authorities say the death toll could be 10,000 in the city of Tacloban, Leyte alone and  approximately four million people are said to have been affected, according to the the country's national disaster agency.

Bodies were seen floating in flooded streets and survivors said the aftermath is like the 2004 Tsunami.

The team of U.S. forces from the 3rd Marine Expeditionary Brigade left for the Philippines from a U.S. base in Okinawa, Japan. According to Marine officials, teams of Marines boarded two KC-130J Hercules transport aircrafts. Meanwhile two Florida-based Navy P-3 Orion surveillance aircrafts, which had been on a six month rotation to Misawa, Japan, have been sent to the Philippines to assist with search and rescue efforts.

Last December U.S. Marines made emergency missions to the the southern Philippines to help the victims of Typhoon Bopha, which killed more than 230 people.

In December 2012 U.S. Marines and Philippine Army personnel work together to unload relief goods to be transported to regions affected by Typhoon Bopha from the Marine Corps KC-130J Hercules millitary aircraft inside the International Airport in Davao, Mindanao.

Typhoon Haiyan is estimated to have killed at least 10,000 people in the central Philippines. Most of the deaths appear to have been caused by surging sea water strewn with debris that many said resembled a tsunami, leveling houses and drowning its victims.

The typhoon is the 30th to hit China this year. As well as the massive numbers feared dead in Tacloban, there are concerns hundreds more have been killed in remote coastal areas.The typhoon is now making its way towards Vietnam and mainland China - with locals bracing themselves for the deadly storm. Chinese authorities have issued a level three emergency response throughout the country, ordering fisherman to shelter their boats to prevent any damage.

On Sunday the Filipino government announced that they were considering introducing martial law to combat widespread looting sprees as homeless search for food.

Reports of lawless mobs ransacking the homes of the dead and remains of shops in Tacloban, Leyte, one of the worst hit parts of the country, has forced President Benigno Aquino to deploy police and army troops to the area to restore calm.

Efforts by aid agencies to deliver food and water have been hampered by plagues of looters attacking emergency convoys and stealing from supply vans, the Philippine Red Cross have said. A TV station reported ATM machines have been broken open.

President Benigno Aquino said: 'Tonight, a column of armored vehicles will be arriving in Tacloban to show the government's resolve and to stop this looting.'
