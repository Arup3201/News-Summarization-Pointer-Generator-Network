You have great weather, good company and a table full of food waiting to be cooked – if only your disposable barbecue would get going.

Tired of prodding coals, a group of entrepreneurs has created an outdoor stove that can cook a meal in just 10 minutes using nothing but the sun's rays.

The gadget, known as the GoSun Stove, absorbs heat from the sun to reach temperatures of over 290°C (554°F).

Hot stuff: Tired of prodding coals, a group of entrepreneurs has created an outdoor stove that can cook a meal in just 10 minutes using nothing but the sun's rays

Its Ohio-based creators claim it can safely cook hot dogs, eight egg omelettes, frozen foods, fish fillets, muffins, stirfrys and even raw meat.

The device is 2ft (0.6 metres) long and 2.25 inches (5.7cm) in diameter and can handle more than three pounds (1.4kg) of food or fluid.

In each batch, the gadget can cook enough food to feed up to four people.

Matt Gillespie, an industrial and social designer working at GoSun Stove, explained how the idea was born.

The 24-year-old said: 'It was all started by Patrick Sherwin, the GoSun Stove's inventor and company founder.

'He was removing a roof mounted solar hot water heating system, using the same tube technology as the GoSun, to replace it with an updated system.

The gadget, known as the GoSun Stove, absorbs heat from the sun to reach temperatures of over 290°C (554°F). 

The core to the technology of the GoSun Stove is the solar evacuated tube that acts as the stove's cooking chamber.

It absorbs absorb more than 80 per cent of the sunlight that's reflected onto the tube.

When clouds interrupt, the food keeps on cooking with the heat stored inside the vacuum tube

The device is 2ft (0.6 metres) long and 2.25 inches (5.7cm) in diameter and can handle more than three pounds (1.4kg) of food or fluid. 

'While up on the roof, he noticed that that the tubes were remarkably hot on the inside, despite the cloudy weather.

'His curiosity got the best of him and he dropped a hotdog into the tube.

'With that lunch sizzling 10 minutes later, the dream was born.'

The core to the technology of the GoSun Stove is the solar evacuated tube that acts as the stove's cooking chamber.

It absorbs more than 80 per cent of the sunlight that's reflected onto the tube.

Mr Gillespie, from Cincinnati, Ohio, added: 'It's profoundly efficient and a game-changer for fuel-free cooking.

'When clouds interrupt, the food keeps on cooking with the heat stored inside the vacuum tube.

'For this same reason the GoSun is extremely versatile, cooking hot meals in the harshest of environments.

'Even against freezing temperatures and blowing winds, the GoSun's cooking time is hardly effected.

'We love to see people's reactions when we're roasting garlic, or steaming veggies on a mostly overcast day.'

A 'GoSun Sport' costs £175 ($280), while a 'GoSun Mini' costs £80 ($128).

The 'GoSun Sport Pro Pack' includes a padded carrying case, an extra cooking tray and spoon and costs £225 ($360).
