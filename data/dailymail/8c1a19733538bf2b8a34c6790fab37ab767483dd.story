Council officials have banned a jolly lollipop man from giving children high fives after receiving a single complaint  that he was holding up traffic.

Parents in Warrington, Cheshire, say they are 'outraged' at the way 62-year-old grandfather Steve Allsopp - who recently suffered a stroke - has been treated.

Mr Allsopp is so popular with children he has been nicknamed the 'jollyman' and has worked at the crossing on Bridge Lane in Stockton Heath for four years.

The 'jollyman': Parents from Cobbs Infants, Broomfields Juniors and St Monica's Primary schools say they are 'outraged' at the way Steve Allsopp (pictured) has been treated by Warrington Borough Council

But the father-of-nine was left 'visibly trembling' last Wednesday after he was told by Warrington Borough Council to stop dishing out high fives.

Clare Phillips, who has a daughter at Cobbs Infants School, said: 'We were coming home from school on Wednesday afternoon and you could tell straightaway that something was up.

'He is normally so full of life but he looked shaken and was visibly trembling. When he told us what had happened we were all outraged.' 

The grandfather-of-14, from Latchford, Warrington, has been has been heavily involved with charity work following the death of his 14-month-old daughter Gaynor in 1974.

Two years ago he published a book called Steve the
Lollipop Man and the Adventures of the Greenfly Villagers to raise 
money for charity.

Mrs Phillips said: 'The kids all love him and always want to stop and have a chat with him come rain or shine.

'They are used to having a high five from him when they cross the road. A lot of them have been upset by it all.'

Parent Barbara McCoy said Mr Allsopp - who has also been told not to speak about the complaint publicly - deserves as apology for the way he has been treated.

The mother-of-two said: 'He was sadly missed when he had a recent stroke and his colleagues were not a patch on him. I hope he gets an apology for this.'

Parents have launched a petition asking 
for the banning of high fives to be reinstated, calling it 'a ludicrous 
example of political correctness gone mad'.

Mother-of-two Joanne Higgins said: 'I never felt like it was causing any health and safety problems.

'The kids looked forward to it so would always cross the road with Steve, which is the safest place for them to cross.'

A council spokesperson said: 'Steve is a very popular local figure and he works at one of the busiest school crossing sites.

'At any one time he might be assisting twenty children and parents to cross the road.

'While Steve does an excellent job of being friendly and helpful during his work, his training emphasises the need to avoid or minimise distractions, and he fully understands the need to put road safety first, including while he's standing on the pavement.'

Mr Allsopp's case follows a lollipop man being banned from high-fiving school children by council bosses in Berkshire who said it 'confuses drivers'.

In July, Roger Green was told that he cannot greet pupils from Sandy Lane Primary School in Bracknell, with the gesture because a driver said it slowed down traffic.

Parents reacted angrily to the ban by Bracknell Forest Council some have complained to the school.

Last month another lollipop man in Devon quit his post after he was threatened with suspension for high-fiving school children by council bosses.

Bob Slade, 65, had been a crossing patrol supervisor outside the Manadon Vale primary school in Plymouth, for four-and-a-half years.

But the former dockyard worker resigned after Plymouth City Council said he would be suspended for four weeks for high-fiving children - which they said was a safety concern.
