Britain's men's football team got off to a nervous start in their opening match against Senegal, taking an early lead but allowing the Africans to draw level late in the second half.

A packed Old Trafford greeted the team 
with an enormous roar as they took to the field hoping to follow the 
example set by the women's team who yesterday beat New Zealand 1-0 in 
their opening match.

It all started well as Welshman Craig Bellamy, who had been booed by sections of the crowd in the opening minutes, found the perfect way to silence his critics, by netting off a Ryan Giggs cross.

But there was heartbreak after Senegal drew level with less than ten minutes to go.

It is Britain's first Olympic men's 
football match since 1960, but it's 100 years since they last lifted 
gold in this tournament.

Both Captain Ryan Giggs and Craig Bellamy were criticised for failing to sing the National Anthem at the start of the match.

GB captain Giggs and his fellow Welshmen  Bellamy, Joe Allen and Neil Taylor remained tight-lipped during the rendition of God Save The Queen at Old Trafford.

Giggs, turning out for 
his first major tournament at the ripe old age of 38, was clearly fired 
up as he spoke to reporters before the match.

He
said: 'My bread and butter is playing for United in front of United 
fans at Old Trafford. This is going to be a bit different.'

But it follows another embarrassing day for the Olympic organisers after
Welsh player Joe Allen was described as English in the official 
programme.

The midfielder, who speaks fluent Welsh and plays for Swansea City, is 
set to start for Great Britain this evening in their opening match with 
Senegal at Old Trafford.

Allen, 22, is one of five Welshmen in the Team 
GB squad but while the others - Ryan Giggs, Craig Bellamy, Neil Taylor 
and Aarson Ramsey - were correctly identified, Allen's entry read: 
'Nationality: English.'

A London 2012 spokeswoman said: 'There was an error in our programme and we inadvertently listed Joe Allen as English.

'We apologise for this mistake and new programmes are now being printed with the correction in time for Team GB's next match.'

It
follows a humiliating series of events last night at Hampden Park in 
Glasgow when the South Korean flag was shown next to the names of the 
North Korean women's football team.

The squad walked off the field in protest and kick-off in their preliminary stage match with Columbia was delayed by an hour.

There was another gaffe yesterday 
when an official British Olympics Association (BOA) sent out an e-mail 
newsletter entitled 'England Women on their way' after Great Britain's 
1-0 win over New Zealand at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff.

A
free-kick on 65 minutes from Stephanie Houghton, an England 
international, ensured the perfect start to the Olympics for Team GB.

Although predominantly English, the women's squad also contains two Scots - Kim Little and Ifeoma Dieke.

And a further mistake came to light yesterday when Ukraine's Foreign Minister Konstantin Grishchenko wrote on Twitter that Ukraine had been listed as a region of Russia in some official London 2012 athlete biographies.

He tweeted: 'I have just ordered our embassy in the UK to contact the Organising Committee to correct the mistakes.

'The word region is a clumsy mistake even from the point of view of English grammar.'

A sell-out crowd is expected at Old Trafford in Manchester as Great Britain kick-off their Olympic football campaign against Senegal at 7.45pm.

And there was an early upset this afternoon to whet the public's appetite for Olympic football when Japan beat favourites Spain 1-0 at Hampden Park.

Yuki Otsu scored the winning goal in the first half, while Inigo Dominguez was sent off for Spain.

But there were reports of long queues outside St James' Park in Newcastle as spectators for the Mexico vs South Korea match were left waiting for up to two hours to collect their tickets.

Many who had bought tickets missed the kick-off as a box office staffed by just four or five officials was overwhelmed.

It will be the first time a British team has competed in an Olympic finals since 1960 but the side will only contain players from the English and Welsh national teams.

The Scottish and Irish national associations declined to make players available because they feared for their integrity as individual football nations. 

Coach Stuart Pearce expressed his enthusiasm for the competition yesterday.

The former England international said: 'We've got a fantastic opportunity to sow a seed and say 'can this happen more often?' and say to the public this is a valid tournament.

'It always boils down to me as a coach that the players go back to their clubs having had a fantastic experience and [having] been very proud to represent Great Britain.'

His captain, the Manchester United stalwart Ryan Giggs, added: 'To be involved in a tournament at such a late stage of my career is one I'm looking forward to.

'All the lads have embraced it, we were fortunate to go to the village last week, you want to enjoy the Olympic experience but the bottom line is you want to win football matches.'

Great Britain also face the United Arab Emirates and Uruguay in Group A with the top two sides qualifying for the quarter-finals.

Team GB may be relieved to get on with 
the action proper after a number of selection controversies in the 
run-up to the Olympics.

David Beckham, widely expected to be included in the 18-man squad as one of three permitted 'overage' players, was controversially omitted.

But the former England international, who had an active role in securing the Olympics for London in 2005, is still keeping busy.

Just hours after playing in a Major League Soccer All-Star team against Chelsea in Pennsylvania, he was raising awareness of child malnutrition with Prime Minister David Cameron and UNICEF representatives at Downing Street in London.

Last night, Gareth Bale was accused of 
turning his back on the Olympics by putting club before country in 
another selection controversy.

The Wales winger had declared himself unfit for the Games but played and scored in a pre-season friendly for his club Tottenham in the United States last night.
