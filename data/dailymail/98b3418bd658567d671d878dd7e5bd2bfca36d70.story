A war of words have kicked off between departing Daily Show host Jon Stewart and wrestling champ Seth Rollins after the WWE star claimed that he could do a better job of hosting the Comedy Central show.

Rollins, the current holder of the esteemed Money In The Bank title, was speaking from the ring during Monday night's edition of WWE Raw when he proudly boasted that he had aspirations beyond being 'the future of WWE'.

'Right now, I am the most talented performer in the entire world. I can do whatever I want, whenever I want,' Rollins told the crowd.

Grudge match: A war of words have kicked off between Daily Show host Jon Stewart and wrestling champ Seth Rollins after the WWE star claimed that he could do a better job of hosting the Comedy Central show

'Hell, if I wanted, I could become president. Or I could take over as host of The Daily Show for Jon Stewart and make that thing actually watchable.'

Stewart, who announced earlier this month that he is leaving his award-winning show after 16 years, is a big fan of WWE and on Thursday responded to Rollins with a short video message in which he warned the wrestler that he was messing with the wrong guy.  

'Seth Rollins, you've made a lot of mistakes in your life: Being a turncoat to the Shield, being a toady for the Authority, not being able to choose which color your hair should be – but this is the biggest mistake you ever made,' said Stewart. 

'You just stepping in a world of hurt, my friend. I'm coming for you Rollins, and you're gonna see it: 160 pounds of dynamite.'

Stewart then admitted that 'my bone density is not what it used to be,' and instead declared himself '160 pounds of wood, like a soft wood. My point is you messed with the wrong guy!'

Rollins was quick to tweet that he is willing to take on the Daily Show host in the ring for a grudge match any time, any place.

'You know where to find me Mt Stewart. @WWEJJSecurity will even hold up the middle rope for you,' he tweeted.
