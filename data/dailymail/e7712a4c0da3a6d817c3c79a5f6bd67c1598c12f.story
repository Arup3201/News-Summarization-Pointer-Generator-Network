A person has died after being hit by a falling tree in high winds in Launceston.

The person died as a result of injuries sustained when a tree fell about 12.30pm on Thursday, police said. No further details were available.

Wild weather is lashing Tasmania, with communities in the state's north facing flooding danger and the south enduring a major blackout.

About 15,000 homes across Tasmania are without power, headlined by 1350 Burnie customers in the state's north west, and 1200 in the Deloraine and Mole Creek area.

But TasNetworks says that after widespread power outages in the south of the island many homes have had power restored.

The damaging winds and heavy rainfall leading to flash flooding will continue to hit the state until Friday, according to the Bureau of Meteorology.

Wind gusts up to 115km/h have been recorded in Devonport, King Island and Smithton, in the north.SES crews tended to dislodged roofs and fallen trees at properties between Latrobe and Circular Head.

SES regional manager Wayne Richards urged Tasmanians to take care when outdoors in the extreme conditions, with the risk of airborne missiles and falling trees.

He also urged residents hit hard by the storm to be patient, with the SES facing a steady stream of callouts from 7am.

'Emergency services and council resources are extremely busy dealing with the effects of the wind and rain and people should be patient when requesting assistance,' he said.

A flight carrying Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Treasurer Joe Hockey was unable to land in Launceston because of the weather and was diverted to Hobart.

Mr Abbott and Mr Hockey instead participated in the Tasmanian Economic Council meeting via teleconference.

Train lines across the north west and west coast have also been affected by the wild weather.TasRail has suspended train services on the Melba Line and west of Western Junction, while its other services are being monitored.

Tas Rail chief executive Damien White said storm debris and falling trees made derailments or collisions a genuine risk.
