North Dakota news anchor A.J. Clemente fired for swearing on his live TV debut continued his round of national media interviews with an appearance on the ‘The Late Show’ with David Letterman on Wednesday night.

Talking about his now infamous appearance on KFYR when his first words were 'F****** S***,' Clemente told Letterman he ‘crawled in bed’ after being told that his slip had been broadcast live.

‘I went home, crawled in bed and called my parents,’ Clemente admitted. ‘But the next day, you gotta pick yourself up, you gotta laugh at yourself and keep going.’

New found fame: A.J. Clemente told Letterman that he'd jump at the chance to work at sports channel ESPN if they offered him a job after his infamous swearing outburst

Clemente admitted to Letterman that his first reaction after the swearing incident was to crawl into bed and call his parents

Clemente has proved a figure of fun for Letterman this week and on Tuesday night he had even devoted his Top 10 list to the sacked anchor's plight.

Several more gags were made at Clemente’s expense on Wednesday’s show, but Letterman also offered words of encouragement during their chat and told him 'he would be just fine.'

But when a cocky-sounding Clemente made it clear he was hoping his moment of madness might turn into an offer of a bigger job ideally from ESPN, Letterman told him to forget it.

‘Look, I'm trying to get you the job back in Bismarck, forget about ESPN,’ said Letterman. ‘That ain't gonna happen. You're going back to Bismarck.’

Second chance: A.J. Clemente, from Bismarck, North Dakota, also appeared on the Today Show

Getting by: Clemente did his best to laugh with the NBC anchors over the situation while still calling his gaffe inexcusable and fully expected to be fired like he was

It has been a busy couple of days for
 Clemente since he inadvertently dropping an F-bomb during his first day
 on the job and promptly got fired.

On Wednesday morning he made appearances on both Live With Kelly and Michael and the Today show.

On Live With Kelly and Michael, the show's control room bleeped Clemente even when he didn’t swear as a joke. Kelly Ripa explained it was a ‘precautionary bleep.’

Still Clemente had the last laugh as the show hired him as celebrity correspondent for a night.

Cohost Michael Strahan told Clemente, ‘One thing about New Yorkers, we believe in giving second chances, man. Yesterday, we called for you. You came here today. (Applause) So, we have a challenge for you if you're willing to accept it. We're going to send you to cover the star-studded red-carpet premiere of Pierce Brosnan's new movie, Love Is All You Need.’

Said Ripa: ‘Now, should you choose to accept this mission, your job is to interview all the celebrities that you can and bring the tape back to us here tomorrow. Are you up for it? What do you think?’

Clemente agreed. ‘Yeah,’ he said, adding, ‘yeah, definitely.’

Spotlight:  AJ Clemente also appeared on LIVE with Kelly and Michael

Earlier on the Today show he revealed that at first he had no idea that his astonishing outburst had been broadcast live on air last Sunday.

'When
 I first saw the clip, it was gut-wrenching,' Clemente told the Today show of those two words that first introduced him to Bismarck's evening 
news audience, as well as the rest of America.

'F****** S***,' Clemente is heard just as the camera cut to him hiding his face at the anchor desk.

'I didn't even know I said it on camera until my news director walked in on the third break,' he said.

His co-anchor appeared to stumble over his profanity but he says it was all a situation of the two of them being tossed to from the control room while caught off guard.

He says he hadn't yet been given an ear piece by the station and his co-anchor had forgotten hers in her car.

Poor introduction: Clemente made the blunder during his first presenting debut on KFYR

'I was looking down, I was going over my script, Van my co-anchor happens to be looking at the camera and she notices the red light comes on, we actually came on 30 seconds early,' he says.

Then when he saw several names he couldn't pronounce related to the London Marathon winners in his upcoming script, 'fireball shot came right out of my mouth,' he explained.

'I fully expected that they would fire me' he said while calling those two words 'inexcusable.'

'Rookie mistake. I’m a free agent. Can’t
 help but laugh at myself and stay positive,' Clemente later wrote on 
Twitter after first being suspended by the station and getting through what he described as a
 'tough day.'

‘I want to apologize for an incident 
that occurred prior to our early newscast this evening, when one of our 
employees used profanity on the air,’ Monica Hannan, KFYR-TV wrote in an apology on the station's Facebook page on Sunday.

Off guard: Clemente told the Today show that he didn't have an ear piece and the control room cut to him and his co-anchor 30 seconds earlier than expected

Opportunity: Helping him out the anchors allowed Clemente to toss to a commercial break as part of his new anchor reel

‘He
 did not realize his microphone was on, but still, that's no excuse. We 
train our reporters to always assume that any microphone is live at any 
time. Unfortunately, that was not enough in this case. WE can't take 
back what was said,' she wrote.

But what Clemente and Hannan both call 'inexcusable,' may have turned into the biggest boost in his career.

At the end of his interview Clemente was given the privilege by NBC’s Matt Lauer of teasing the next segments on Today while throwing to a commercial break.

'Thank God for each day,' Clemente tweeted on Wednesday.
