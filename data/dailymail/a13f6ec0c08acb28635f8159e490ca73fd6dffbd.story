In an unlikely sequence of events, TOWIE's Lauren Goodger has emerged as the celebrity with the wardrobe women most wish to emulate.

The reality TV star has been responsible for the sale of most 'copycat' outfits at one particular shop, followed by maths whizz Carol Vorderman, presenter Melanie Sykes, and fellow Essex girl Amy Childs.

And the shop in question? Hybrid, an Essex fashion boutique which supplies clothes to celebrities based in the south of England, which may explain why TOWIE's Sam Faiers and Hollyoaks' Gemma Merna made the list ahead of more traditional sartorial icons such as the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Moss and Victoria Beckham.

According to the fashion outlet, more female shoppers have been snapping up dresses she has worn than any other star.

Other celebrities who have a dramatically positive effect on sales are former Countdown brainbox Carol Vorderman, model Melanie Sykes and former TOWIE girl Amy Childs.

It also emerged Waterloo Road actress Chelsee Healey has completely the opposite effect, along with Lauren's TOWIE co-star Gemma Collins. Hybrid saw reductions in sales after the two women wore their clothes.

Another TOWIE star, Billi Mucklow, also has a detrimental effect on dress sales - as does Desperate Scousewives star and self-proclaimed 'man-eater' Layla Flaherty.

Former page three girl Nicola McLean is another celebrity who does nothing for the clothes she chooses, according to the statistics.

Danielle Bigaignon, from Hybridfashion.com said: 'Girls relate to celebrities who they look up to or aspire to be like.

'We feel the female celebrities who wear our designs are those who are portrayed as very down-to-earth, confident and at ease with their shape.

'Lauren Goodger, for instance, is in the media regularly exposing her fuller figure, and girls look up to her for that.

'She has inspired girls to embrace their curves and not to have body hang ups which stop them living their life.

'This has in turn boomed sales of dresses worn by Lauren in particular, as girls feel they are the designs that will help them look as good as her.'

Hybrid reported that clothes worn by burns victim Katie Piper, left, and Hollyoaks actress Gemma Merna sell well in their Essex boutique

Ms Bigaignon added that Carol Vorderman has inspired the slightly older woman to also embrace their figures, teaching them that 'you are never too old to wear a body-con pencil dress which can make you look and feel fabulous'.

She added: 'She is a great example of someone who has preserved their youth and gives Hybrid a wide target audience with ladies of the older generation sporting Hybrid to work, events and functions.'

Also on the winning list were TOWIE'S Sam Faiers, 22, and Gemma Merna, 28, who plays Carmel Valentine in Hollyoaks. Sky Sports News presenter Charlotte Jackson, 33, also made the top ten as did acid burns victim Katie Piper, 29.

Charley Bird, 23, from X Factor band 2Shoes also has a positive effect.

But Chelsee Healey was joined in the hall of shame by TOWIE'S Chloe Sims, model and TV presenter Imogen Thomas, and Big Brother star Josie Gibson.

Danielle Bigaignon added: 'Celebrities such as Chelsee Healey are renowned for having very bad taste in fashion.

'Regardless of her wearing a Hybrid dress or not she has these negative connotations which she hasn't shaken off yet.

'When Chelsea was spotted in Hybrid it had no impact on sales at all as we feel girls wouldn't naturally look to her for style inspiration.
