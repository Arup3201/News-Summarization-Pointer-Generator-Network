A Staffordshire bull terrier stolen more than five years ago has turned up 500 miles away in Scotland.

Ellie disappeared in 2009 after her owner tied her up for two minutes outside a newsagent in Bere Regis, Dorset - and despite a lengthy search she was not seen again.

That was until last week, when the microchipped pet was finally reunited with her shocked 36-year-old owner Sharon Collins after being found wandering the streets of Kirkcaldy, Fife.

Gonna be there next to you: Ellie the staffie may have walked 500 miles after turning up in Scotland five years after she was stolen from owner Sharon Collins (left) - or she may have been driven there and escaped

A dognapper is thought to have unclipped Ellie’s lead in January 2009, sparking a search which included the missing pet directory Dog Lost.

To Ms Collins' shock, a volunteer from the directory knocked on her door last week after the black staffie was taken in to Langdyke Boarding Kennels in Fife.

Staff who tried to contact the pub worker discovered her mobile number had expired - but fortunately the volunteer lived just round the corner from her Dorset home.

Ms Collins said: 'It was like losing a child.

'You never lose hope completely, but I just wanted to know that she was okay and being looked after.

'A lot of people made donations to get her down here. A woman from the kennels drove her from Scotland to Peterborough and another woman drove her from Peterborough to Dorset.

Owner Sharon Collins said: 'It was like losing a child. I just wanted to know that she was okay'

'When I saw her I was very tearful. I was just so happy to have her back.'

She added: 'I’d like to say a special thanks to the kennels and to all the people involved in getting her home safely.'

Sylvia Pass, the kennels owner who made the drive to Peterborough, said: 'Ellie was in excellent condition with excellent muscle tone and teeth.

'There is no way of knowing where she has been for five years but she could have been taken to Scotland from Dorset and been kept as a pet for five years before escaping.

'When we scanned her microchip the number for Sharon was wrong so we went through the Dog Lost records and found a mention of Ellie, and Sharon’s old address was listed.

'A member of staff from Dog Lost went to the address and found out where she was currently living. When they knocked the door she was absolutely amazed.'
