David Cameron is to urge Barack Obama to force US-based web giants to do more to tackle terrorism.

The Prime Minister will use talks in the White House to press for tougher action to require the companies to alert authorities to suspicious online exchanges, ban encrypted communications and store data.

He accuses them of failing to assist in the fight against terror, and insists they have a ‘moral duty’ to act.

David Cameron is to urge Barack Obama to force US-based web giants to do more to tackle terrorism

Cyber-terrorism and surveillance will be central issues at the visit, which Tory strategists hope will be a pre-election ‘love-in’ between Mr Cameron and Mr Obama and boost the Prime Minister’s standing at home.

Unusually, the President has agreed to host Mr Cameron close to an election, apparently repaying the favour Mr Cameron made by visiting the US and all but endorsing him during the last presidential race.

In the wake of the terrorist attacks in France, the leaders will focus on economic and national security — which they will argue are linked.

British officials said Mr Cameron, due to begin his two-day visit to Washington today, would seek support for a crackdown on terrorists using social networks and other websites to communicate and foment hatred.

A report last year into the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby concluded that Facebook failed to pass on information that could have prevented his death, and that the website is a ‘safe haven for terrorists’.

One of his killers, Michael Adebowale, used it to express his intent to murder a soldier ‘in the most graphic and emotive manner’ five months before the attack, Parliament’s intelligence and security committee found.

Facebook had previously shut down his accounts because he’d discussed terrorism – but failed to relay concerns to the security services.

A senior Lib Dem peer and terror expert yesterday dismissed claims that a so-called ‘snoopers’ charter’ would be used to spy on ordinary members of the public.

Lord Carlile said MI5 agents simply ‘do not have time’ to carry out random investigations.

His intervention was seen as a snub to party leader Nick Clegg, who has repeatedly opposed the Communications Data Bill, which gives security officials the power to access the public’s emails and internet history.

Lord Carlile said the term snoopers’ charter was ‘grossly misleading’, adding: ‘MI5 do not have the time to intervene in the communications of ordinary citizens unless there is a reason or possibly happens by mistake as occasionally occurs.’

Home Secretary Theresa May yesterday implied that Mr Clegg’s position was putting the lives of ‘innocent’ people in peril. She said it was ‘highly probable’ that communications data was used in Paris to locate the Charlie Hebdo terrorists.

British security sources say they often have ‘considerable difficulty’ in accessing online communications on sites belonging to US-based internet companies, such as Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter and Yahoo. Some of these say they can’t cooperate because they ‘need to protect users’ privacy’.

Mr Cameron also wants a ban on encrypted communications services, such as Snapchat and WhatsApp, whose messages cannot be accessed by intelligence and security agencies even if they have a valid warrant.

A senior Government source said: ‘If you are talking about concerns around extremism and terrorism, one of the things clearly to talk about is how do we cooperate on this, how do we keep pace with developments in technology and capabilities and what our agencies need.

‘The Prime Minister’s objective here is to get the US companies to cooperate with us more, to make sure that our intelligence agencies get the information they need to keep us safe.’

Companies such as YouTube and Facebook insist they take terrorism seriously and share the British Government’s aims to prevent it. But they say it is not as clear-cut as preventing child abuse – where images are illegal and are immediately reported to the authorities and ‘fingerprinted’ so they do not recur.

Online videos involving terrorism, violence or incitement are already taken down when they are reported by users, and the perpetrators’ accounts are blocked. But material has to be considered on a case-by-case basis.

There are 300 hours of video uploaded on to YouTube every minute, 12billion exchanges on Facebook every day and 500million tweets.

The firms insist the technology does not exist to automatically flag up alarming or provocative content, and so they rely on users reporting material.

Britain and the US can only defend their freedoms if they boost their economic strength, David Cameron and Barack Obama say today.

The two leaders, speaking as Mr Cameron arrived in Washington for talks with the US President, said they agreed on a series of measures that would bolster both economies against another global downturn.

Officials say Mr Cameron and Mr Obama will link economic security and national security – arguing the West can only protect its citizens and its values if it retains its economic dominance.

The world leaders said they will support small businesses, expand apprenticeships, improve education for all, and back increases in the minimum wage

In a joint statement today they said: ‘We’re working to help families stake their claim to a better future and buy their first home. 

'We’re supporting small businesses, expanding apprenticeships, improving education for all, and backing increases in the minimum wage.' 

The Prime Minister will today join International Monetary Fund boss Christine Lagarde for talks on the global economic outlook for the year – with warnings lights again flashing in the Eurozone.

The Prime Minister and President Obama added: ‘Over the last few years, our governments have worked closely to restore economic growth, improve our living standards and make sure families get the help they needed.

‘Yet we know that progress and prosperity are never guaranteed. As we meet today at the White House, we reaffirm our belief that our ability to defend our freedoms is rooted in our economic strength, and the values that we cherish – freedom of expression, the rule of law, and strong democratic institutions.

‘We must do all we can to bolster our economies against another global economic downturn.’

The leaders will meet today and tomorrow for talks on national security, particularly tackling the threat of violent extremism including the response to the terror attacks in Paris last week.

In a joint article in The Times, they added: 'Security and prosperity go hand in hand. By confronting the terrorists who threaten us, standing together against Russia’s aggressive acts and continuing our efforts to advance our economic growth, we will continue to advance the security and prosperity that our people deserve.'

Underlining the importance of the economic relationship between both countries, US and UK companies are also set to announce trade and investment deals worth more than £1.1 billion, creating 1,700 new jobs in the UK.

Deals to be announced today include a £660m investment by Carlyle International Energy Partners in the UK’s oil and gas industry in the North Sea.

Food manufacturer, Mars, will announce a multi-million pound expansion of its facility in Kings Lynn, a UK development company and US firm Grand Heritage Hotel Group will unveil plans for a new £400m all-weather leisure, health, sport and education destination on the edge of the Peak District National Park. 

And there will be £1.3m in U.S. government funding for Watford-based Smiths Detection, for research and development of its wearable chemical detection technology, already used by over 100,000 troops in the UK, U.S., and around the world.
