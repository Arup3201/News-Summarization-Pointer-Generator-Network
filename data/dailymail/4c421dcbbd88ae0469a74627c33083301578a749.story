A timewaster dialled 999 to complain that McDonalds staff were refusing to serve them while another woman called police after she forgot the password to her laptop, it emerged today.

West Midlands Police revealed some of their most bizarre calls which also included one man telephoning to ask whether he needed to put his area code before dialling 101 - the force’s non-emergency number.

Others who misused the service included one caller asking if officers could come out to scare his sister, while another woman grumbled about being refused entry to a nightclub.

The force released the almost unbelievable call-outs as part of an awareness campaign to highlight abuse of the emergency helpline, which receives around 700,000 calls a year.

Chief Inspector Sally Holmes said: 'These calls are ridiculous and it doesn’t end just there.

'We regularly receive calls to 999 about lost property, people asking for directions and from people who have been denied entry to a nightclub.

'It's astonishing listening to them, but they hide a serious truth.

'Each call often takes minutes to deal with as staff have to clarify the situation and it might not sound like much but, if someone is trying to get through to report a genuine life or death emergency, then a minute is a very long time to wait.

'I cannot stress enough that the 999 number is for emergencies only, for guidance this is defined as: a crime is in progress, someone suspected of a crime is nearby, when there is danger to life or when violence is being used or threatened.

'To contact police for any other reason, call 101.'

In one of the calls released by the force a hungry McDonalds customer called 999 to say he was holding up a queue at the drive-thru because staff had refused to serve him.

In the sound clip he can be heard saying: 'It is a bit of an emergency, but it isn’t at the same time.

'Basically I’ve come into McDonalds and ordered some food and there’s been a misunderstanding.

'We’ve drove back round and none of the staff are coming to the tills - they are just ignoring us.

'So we have decided to stop in the drive-thru now - but there’s 20 cars behind us now.'

The frustrated operator can then be heard saying: 'This is not a police matter sir, at all.  You don't dial 999 unless it's a life or death emergency.'

In a separate call, a woman tells a 999 call operator: 'I’m calling because my laptop had closed and I need the password number.'

To which the baffled worker can then be heard replying: 'You have called the police to get a password for your laptop?'

And in a final call released by the force, a voice with a strong Birmingham accent can be heard requesting: 'Excuse me sweetheart, what I’m after right....you know the 101 number - do you have to press 0121?'

The force revealed that almost half of the 700,000 telephone calls received annually by the force’s emergency number were inappropriate.

Today they began a 24-hour tweetathon to show the array of calls it receives.

One tweet posted yesterday morning said: '999 call just received from an unlocked phone in a pocket, tying up an emergency line. Remember to check your phone is locked!'

Another read: 'We’ve just received a 999 call from a young man at a phone box who is abusing our 999 operators.'
