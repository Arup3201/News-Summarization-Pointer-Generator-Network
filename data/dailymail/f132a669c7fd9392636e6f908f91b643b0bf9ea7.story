Police in Florida have arrested a cat burglar accused of stealing more than $10 million worth of fine antique silver.

For years, the precious pieces of silver were stolen mainly from historic mansions across the south and celebrity homes including those belonging to Billy Joel and Ivana Trump.

In virtually every instance, no clues were left and the robber, Blane Nordahl, 51, would even cover his tracks, replacing panes of glass removed from windows.

To catch a thief: Lonnie Mason, a retired New Jersey detective, suspected that a series of thefts in the South might be the work of an old adversary. He made a career out of chasing Blane Nordahl

The Nassau County Sheriff's Office in Florida say Nordahl was expert at sneaking past ‘sleeping dogs’ and disabling alarm systems.

‘When all alarms were disabled, he would remove entire drawers full of silver items and take them outside to test them with his own silver test kit; plate silver would be thrown away at the scene and he would leave with only the finest and most expensive items,’ said Sheriff Bill Leeper said in a statement.

Only the finest: Blane Nordahl would only snatch high-quality silverware, leaving behind lesser silver and cheaper jewellery

The robberies began in February 2011 yet despite dozens taking place across the South from Tennessee to Florida, local police seemed unable to connect the dots until a retired New Jersey police detective who had put Nordahl away five times previously, worked it out.

Ex-cop Lonnie Mason first put Nordahl away in 1983 and figured it wouldn’t be  long before he got up to his old tricks.

He put together a four-man crew of retired police detectives and one retired federal marshal with the sole purpose of tracking Nordahl and putting him behind bars.

All of the retired detectives came across the silver stealer at least once in their respective professional paths, in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and 
Connecticut.

‘I started Googling silver thefts,’ Mason told ABCNews.com.
‘And as soon as I saw a pattern, I knew it was Blane. I called the 
police in Atlanta and told them, 'Let me explain how this is all going 
to go down.'’

During his 
career, Detective Mason became something of an expert on Nordahl and 
nicknames him ‘The Silver Thief’ or the ‘Thief to the Stars,’.

‘It's
his addiction,’ Det. Mason said. ‘He doesn't do drugs or drink alcohol.
But needs to steal. He feeds off it. He needs to prove he's better than
the police.’

He explained 
that robbing silver also had its advantages with many victims not 
realising they have been robbed until closer to the holidays when it’s 
time to take out the good silverware.

He
would usually target expensive homes and look for leads in architecture
magazines that showcased the homes of the rich and famous.

The
retired detective helped several police departments with their 
enquiries pointing out similarities in the cases such as the same way in
which the suspect always cut holes in windows, so he could crawl in.

Then he would snatch high-quality silverware, leaving behind less valuable silver and pieces of jewellery.

Sheriff's deputies in Hilliard, Florida arrested Nordahl on Monday and charged him with felony burglary and conspiracy.

After a short chase, he was cuffed and officers called Detective Mason to let him know the news.

‘They told him, 'Blane, there's someone on the phone.' When they told 
him it was Lonnie Mason, he just buried his head in his knees,’ 
Detective Mason said.

‘I 
know Blane,’ Mason said. ‘He can't help himself. In the past I tried 
helping him get a job. The guy is brilliant and could do anything he 
chose. But he chose being a thief.’

Although
Nordahl was arrested in Florida, he is expected to be extradited first 
to Atlanta before authorities in Tennessee and South Carolina press 
charges.
