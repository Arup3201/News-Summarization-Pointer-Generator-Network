A family in Williamsburg is set to move into a home constructed out of shipping containers.

The three-story home in Brooklyn’s hottest neighborhood is made from 21 shipping containers and is currently under construction.

Though not the first home to be made of shipping containers, even in Williamsburg, it has multiple unique design elements that set it apart from other container homes.

Revolutionary design: The unusual design takes it's cues from the neighborhood around it, the architects say

A look inside: A cross-section of the interior shows three levels and a pool

Lap of luxury: The lavish home is in Brooklyn's trendiest neighborhood

The home has a staggering 5,000 square feet of space and features several unique design cues not seen on most homes in the city, it was first reported by CurbedNY.

The 21 containers are diagonally cut at both the top and bottom of the home, creating open space in front of the home and private outdoor space for each of the home’s levels, designers LOT-EK explain on their website.

The front cut out also allows for a car to access the below-ground garage.

The blueprint: This home has everything, even a garage

All in place: All the boxes are now in place, but much work is left on the inside

Side view: Another view of the still-under-construction home

The home has solar panels on the rough and several sky lights to make it more eco-friendly and provide natural lighting.

Additional features include a BBQ pit, fireplace, lap pool, media room with stadium seating and a yard, according to Gothamist.

Childrens’ bedrooms are made of single crates to provide privacy, according to Curbed.

Behold: The Brooklyn home constructed from 21 shipping containers

Like pieces of a puzzle: Construction crews lower each container into place

Getting there: The pieces are now all in place, but the home is still far from finished

The top floor master suite is an open room with large windows and an open shower, the site added.

Other amenities include an outdoor deck, open kitchen and having the house everyone in the city’s trendiest neighbourhood will be talking about for quite some time.
