Ana Ivanovic’s long wait to follow up on her 2008 French  Open title goes on after she crashed out of the third round 6-3, 6-3 to Czech Lucie Safarova.

Four of the top five seeds have now gone, with Petra Kvitova ousted 6-7, 6-1, 9-7 by Svetlana Kuznetsova, showing just how open women’s tennis is.

Ivanovic was starting to look like the player to beat, but then Safarova is a player who always gives her nightmares, having beaten her on their four previous meetings.

Upset: Lucie Safarova pulled off an unexpected victory against Ana Ivanovic at the French Open

Against the odds: Ivanovic won at Roland Garros in 2008 but has not even made the fourth round this time

Her left-hander’s ability to sweep the 
ball away from the formidable Ivanovic forehand is the key, and it all 
turned out like the  26-year-old from Belgrade had dreaded.

‘She’s a lefty, it’s not something we 
face every day and the ball comes a little bit differently,’ said 
Ivanovic. ‘In the beginning I felt like I had a lot of chances I didn’t 
use. If I did, the match maybe would have had a different tone to it. 
I’m really disappointed that I lost, but she played tough today.

‘I lost to her a lot of times before. So I knew she was going to be dangerous.’

The
 highest seed remaining in her half of the draw now is Heather Watson’s 
conqueror, Romanian Simona Halep, with Maria Sharapova facing an awkward
 test today on the other side of the draw, against Australian Samantha 
Stosur.

Well beaten: The Serb lost in straight sets to the inexperienced Safarova, 6-3, 6-3
