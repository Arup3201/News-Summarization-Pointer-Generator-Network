A fascinating map has been released online that demonstrates the staggering advances technology has made to commuters embarking on one day of travel from New York City.

Less than a quarter of a century after the Declaration of Independence, Philadelphia was still more than 24-hours away from the nation's largest city, but over the course of 134-years, Los Angeles was reachable in the same amount of time.

The map reveals the transition of horse carriage to train as technology opened up the continent - eventually giving way to the airline boom of the 1930s, which meant that nowhere on the 48-contiguous states was more than one day away.

One day of travel: This is a representation of the map that Charles O. Paullin published as the monumental Atlas of the Historical Geography of the United States which has been published online by the Digital Scholarship Lab at The University of Richmond

The map is in fact compiled from the legendary Atlas of the Historical Geography of the United States, which was first published by Charles O. Paullin in 1932 and contained over 700 examples of every aspect of the nation's expansion from British colony to continental power.

In addition to the opening up of the nation by rail and air, the maps documented population explosions, presidential elections and even shipping times from New York to North Carolina.

Thirty years time: In 1800 it was impossible to get to Philadelphia from New York and New Orleans was a month away by stagecoach - while by 1830 these times had essentially been halved as the railroads across the United States began to become established

The golden spike: The transcontinental railroad across the United States opened up travel from West to East Coast - and put most of the Northeast and Midwest within 2 days of New York - but San Francisco and the West Coast were still up to a month away

Philadelphia, where the Founding Father's wrote and signed the Constitution, opened up as a day-trip to New Yorker's around 1830.

However, the nation's captial at Washington D.C. was still over one days travel from the cultural and financial center of the fledgling United States.

As the nation's railroads were established, travel times were essentially halved, but by 1930, it was still just possible to reach St. Louis by train.

Obviously, destinations reachable within one day spectacularly shortened and by 1930 a plane journey put Denver within reach of all travelers.

Advances: After more than 70 years of transcontinental rail travel - commuters and travelers were able to traverse the 48-contiguous states with three days - a staggering shortening in times

In 1934, TWA made the East-West coast divide less than a day, when they pioneered a three-stop airline service between New York and Los Angeles that took a total of 18-hours to complete.

Paullin's incredibly detailed maps were turned into modern interactive, motion-picture maps by the University of Richmond's Digital Scholarship Lab - ready to be poured over by the iPad generation.

Fliers: However, while the railroads were now offering to put the nation's largest cities in reach of one another - air travel finally put Los Angeles within one day's travel - all by the third decade of the 20th century

The one-day time estimates themselves were made by Paullin and his team and in one revealing snippet from the original text, he states that in 1800 stagecoach runs from New York would fail to leave the Northeast while a trip to Charleston, South Carolina would take a staggering 10 days of sailing.

Paullin's maps were viewed as visionary when they were released - as their demonstrations of time changes and technological changes revealed the growth of the nation.

Thirty years time: In 1800 it was impossible to get to Philadelphia from New York and New Orleans was a month away by stagecoach - while by 1830 these times had essentially been halved as the railroads across the United States began to become established

Presidential victor: This map shows how each county voted in the 1892 general election won by Democrat Grover Cleveland against Benjamin Harrison and Populist Party candidate James B. Weaver

Given fresh new life by their digital re-haul, the maps of travel times act as a testament to infrastructure changes and technological advancements.

The 'golden spike' that was driven into the ground to mark the completion of the United State's transcontinental railway was hit in 1869 and of course automobiles became mass produced in 1908 with the Model T Ford.

'It’s so far ahead of its time,' Edward L. Ayers, the founder of the Digital Scholarship Lab and a senior consultant on the project said to the New York Times.

'It suggests how people experienced geography. You could ask, ‘What would it mean for a family to move to Kansas?’
