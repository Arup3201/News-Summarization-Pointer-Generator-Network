A German artist has recreated the movement of Olympic artists in a series of surreal animations designed to show exactly how they move.

Athletes including Michael Phelps, Usain Bolt and gymnast Nadia Comăneci were transformed into a series of flowing animations.

The performances were captured in 3D then recreated electronically, substituting abstract lines and curves for the athlete's body.

The movements of famous Olympians, in this case Michael Phelps, were digitised using 3D motion tracking and rotoscoping of original footage of Olympic competitions

Camera motions and playback speed of the footage were also captured, and the movements of the athletes were recreated frame by frame.

This allowed the artist to easily replace the athletes body with abstract shapes.

The specific character of each sport is reflected in the visual language and the illustration of its motions

German motion designer Felix Deimann created the project for his thesis. 

'My thesis, the experimental animation 'Citius, Altius, Fortius' (Latin for 'Faster, Higher, Stronger'- the Olympic motto) explores the interplay of abstract shapes and motions.

'How can the substance of motion be visualized. 

'What degree of abstraction allows a communication with the viewer,' Deimann said.

The movements of famous Olympians were digitised using 3D motion tracking and rotoscoping of original footage of Olympic competitions. 

This allowed every movement, including limbs and even fingers, to be captured.
