A secret meeting was held between a representative of the Wyoming chapter of the NAACP and a Ku Klux Klan organizer on Saturday night under tight security at a Casper hotel.

The meeting was called by Jimmy Simmons, president of the Casper NAACP, after he heard that KKK literature was being distributed in nearby Gillette.

Klan organizer John Abarr, who believes in creating an all-white nation independent from the United States, accepted the invitation and maintained his organization is non-violent.

The unlikely meeting even ended with the 
KKK's Abarr paying to join the ranks of the civil rights group when he 
paid a $30 membership fee.

Abarr told The Associated Press on Tuesday he filled out an NAACP membership form so he could get the group's newsletters and some insight into its views.

Simmons said he asked for the meeting after receiving reports that KKK literature was being distributed in Gillette, about 130 miles north of Casper, and to discuss race relations, including what he said were reported beatings of African-American men. He did not provide details.

Abarr said he knew nothing about hate crimes or the literature, which was distributed in a residential neighborhood of Gillette in October.

Gillette police Lt. Chuck Deaton said there have been 10 hate or bias crimes reported in the past five years that involved name-calling but no assaults on African-Americans. Deaton said police also were unable to speak with a young man distributing the literature, and he was chased away by neighbors.

‘In the 21 years that I've been here, that's the first I heard of the Klan in Gillette,’ Deaton said.

Officials with the NAACP in Washington, D.C., requested questions about the meeting in writing but did not immediately respond.

United Klans of America imperial wizard Bradley Jenkins of Birmingham, Ala., said in a telephone interview that he sanctioned the meeting and called it a first between the KKK and the NAACP, the nation's oldest civil rights organization.

Not a lot in common: Saturday's secretive meeting was the first meeting between the two groups in history according to both sides and the Southern Poverty Law center

The meeting between Jimmy Simmons of the NAACP and Abarr's United Klans of America may not have any historical precedent, but both groups have plenty of history, throughout which they've remained staunch ideological enemies.

NAACP

The NAACP was formed as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in 1909 in part as a response to the KKK-led lynchings that were terrorizing black communities in America at the time, notably through lynchings.

The group's goal is to eliminate barriers to equality faced by minority groups in America and eliminate racial prejudice through grass roots activism and education efforts.

The group has seen major victories since its founding, having played a role in everything from the dismantling of Jim Crow laws to helping pass hate crime laws.

Today, the NAACP is fighting for changes to drug sentencing laws, sturdier voter protections, laws to prevent future deaths like Trayvon Martin's, among other goals.

The NAACP claimed a membership of around 500,000 as of 2011.

That year, the group's revenue totaled nearly $32,000,000.

UNITED KLANS OF AMERICA

The United Klans of America (UKA) was once the largest of several Ku Klux Klan groups in America.

The UKA was one of the most well-known and active groups working in opposition to the civil rights movement of the 1960s and 1970s, including the efforts of the NAACP.

The group has been called the most murderous of any other group of its day and is blamed for the beating of Freedom Riders in 1961, the murder of civil rights worker Viola Liuzzo, and the infamous bombing Birmingham's 16th Street Baptist Church, which killed four young black girls in 1963.

The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) won a 1987 legal victory over the UKA that effectively saw the group dismantled.

Since the 1980s, the Klan has largely remained splintered and unorganized, wracked by internal strife, lawsuits, and government infiltration.

The SPLC estimates that various Klan groups, mostly unrelated and warring, count between 5,000 and 8,000 members nationwide.

According to the Casper Star-Tribune, John Abarr and his group are pushing for the states of Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington to secede from the United States and form an all-white state.

'Because we want white babies,' Abarr explains.

‘I don't know if we accomplished too much,’ Abarr said. ‘We're not about violence. We're about being proud to be white.’

Mark Potok, a senior fellow at the Southern Poverty Law Center, said there have been meetings between white and African-American groups, but none between the NAACP and the KKK.

He called the United Klans of America a ‘copycat wannabe’ group that's not the group responsible for violence during the civil rights movement of the 1960s, including the deaths of four girls at a Baptist church in Birmingham.

The original UKA was dismantled in the 1980s following a lawsuit by the Southern Poverty Law Center.

‘I think it's outrageous and counterproductive,’ Potok said of the Wyoming meeting. ‘It gives legitimacy to the Klan as an organization you can talk to.’

Simmons insisted the meeting was worth it.

‘It's about opening dialogue with a group that claims they're trying to reform themselves from violence,’ Simmons said. ‘They're trying to shed that violent skin, but it seems like they're just changing the packaging.’

Abarr said he didn't ask anybody if they would like to join the KKK.

‘You have to be white to join the Klan,’ he said.

In 1989, Abarr was a campaign manager for William Daniel Johnson, a white separatist who ran unsuccessfully for Dick Cheney's Wyoming U.S. House seat when Cheney became defense secretary. Johnson proposed an amendment to the U.S. Constitution calling for citizenship for whites only.
