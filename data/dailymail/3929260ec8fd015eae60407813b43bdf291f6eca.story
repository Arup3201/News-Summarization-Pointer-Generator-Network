A bizarre green flurry of lights off the coast of Bangkok left an astronaut baffled after he took a picture of it this week.

Astronaut Reid Wiseman posted the image yesterday tweeting: 'Bangkok is a bright city. The green lights outside the city? No idea.'

The Baltimore native, who is on board the International Space Station, took the image from more than 200 miles (320km) above the planet and the green glow was clearly visible.

Theories ranged from aliens to nuclear waste and bioluminescent algae - but Nasa claims there is a far more 'fishy' explanation.

It is thought the lights - the location of which would place them in the sea in the Gulf of Thailand - were in fact created by fishing boats.

The offshore illumination comes from enormous arrays of bright green LED lights used to attract squid and other sea life to the surface.

According to an October 2013 article on Nasa's Earth Observatory site by Michael Carlowicz: 'Fishermen from South America and Southeastern Asia light up the ocean with powerful lamps that attract the plankton and fish species that the squid feed on.

Short-finned squid live 260ft to 1,970ft (80m to 600m) below the surface feeding on shrimp, crabs, and fish. 

Lights causes their food to be attracted to the surface of the ocean

This, in turn, attracts the squid to the surface where they are easier for fishermen to catch with jigging lines.

Scientists first noted such night-lighting of the seas in the late 1970s and early 1980s, while compiling the first maps of Earth at night. 

'The squid follow their prey toward the surface, where they are easier for fishermen to catch with jigging lines.

'Squid boats can carry more than a hundred of these lamps, generating as much as 300 kilowatts of light per boat.'

'These lights help reveal the full range, patterns, and night-to-night variability of these fishing activities in striking detail,' said Dr Steve Miller, a Colorado State University scientist who works with VIIRS night time imagery.

'It's just another example of how much information exists in night lights measurements and how unique they are for coupling human activity with the natural environment in a way that conventional visible imagery cannot do
