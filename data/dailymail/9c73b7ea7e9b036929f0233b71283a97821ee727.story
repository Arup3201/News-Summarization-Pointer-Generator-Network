When they're sleeping soundly the precious darlings look their most angelic.

But one artist has managed to make a group of snoozing newborn babies look even more precious by dressing them up and positioning them for a unique photo shoot. 

Professional photographer Joanne Collins, 39, who is based in Sittingbourne, Kent, waits until the babies are in a very deep sleep so she can move them about without them waking.

The heart-melting pouts and smiles, though, are all their own doing.

The babies are so tiny and precious and the utmost care is required so they are safe, secure and content

Joanne specialises in capturing newborns posed as they slumber, and is an expert at handling them from a very early age. She says that it is best to photograph the youngsters at between just five to ten days, before they lose their foetal-like poses.

The babies are seen snuggled into warm blankets and cushions, some adorned in cute woollen hats or cosy in baby baskets in the adorable pictures.

Joanne says: 'I have truly been captivated by the world of photography since the young age of twelve. I began by photographing children and families, but my portfolio grew rapidly to incorporate newborn babies, weddings, commercial, fine art and more.

'This is one of my most favourite aspects of photography. Photographing newborn babies under 14 days is truly wonderful and sentimental.

'The photoshoot takes four hours and requires patience and true dedication. The babies are so tiny and precious and the utmost care is required so they are safe, secure and content.  

The first step in the four-hour photo shoot operation is to ensure they have a very full tummy and that the room is warm

The colour toning with the chosen props need to harmonise beautifully and the lighting must be perfect

'This is fundamental to achieving the special and very cute poses. It really is an absolute honour and privilege to be able to photograph these little miracles. 

'There are a few principals to photographing newborns.

'The first is to ensure they have a very full tummy and that the room is warm as the babies do not, at this age, like for their clothes to be removed. 

'I use a special beanbag with plentiful blankets, as well as props, such as backdrops, baskets, hats and hairbands.

'The colour toning with the chosen props need to harmonise beautifully. The lighting must be perfect and the correct lenses and camera settings used. 

'Specific newborn photography requires specialised training in order to understand how to manage and photograph the babies.

The joy experienced when the special poses are captured is second to none and I adore it like nothing else, says Joanne

Every parent is always so pleased that they went ahead with their photoshoot, the experience is unbelievable, she says

'The first steps are to ensure the baby is in a very deep sleep, so that they are lovely and relaxed enough to position into the poses. Understanding the correct way to hold and soothe babies is paramount to ensuring they feel secure enough to sleep.

'These photos are really a once in a lifetime opportunity, as once they pass the 14 days they tend to be more awake and less fetal like. Five to ten days is the ideal time to photograph your baby.

'The joy experienced when the special poses are captured is second to none and I adore it like nothing else. I enjoy taking photographs that cannot be re-captured, making them ever more memorable and extra special for the family to relive over and over again. 

'Every parent is always so pleased that they went ahead with their photoshoot, the experience is unbelievable and the pictures to be kept close to their hearts forever.

'Almost all of my work comes from recommendations, which I am happy to say, speaks for itself!'
