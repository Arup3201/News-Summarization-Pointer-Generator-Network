A top leader of the Basque separatist group ETA has been arrested in an anti-terror operation in France.

Izaskun Lesaka, 37, who is said to be responsible for the terrorist group’s arms and explosives caches and another suspected ETA member, Joseba Iturbide Ochoteco, 35, were arrested in the early hours of Sundday by elite French police in a hotel in Macon, France, Spain’s Interior Ministry said in a statement.

The suspects, both armed, were tracked down and arrested by a special operations tactical unit of the French National Police in close collaboration with Spanish counterparts.

ETA is considered a terrorist organisation by Spain, America and the European Union. It is blamed for the killings of more than 825 people in a campaign of bombings and shootings for an independent Basque state straddling Spain's border with France. 

It is believed that Lesaka was considered one of ETA's top three leaders and that police also seized ‘abundant computer equipment and a stolen car with false number plates’.

Group numbers have been decimated by waves of arrests in Spain, France and other countries over recent years which have further weakened the declining grassroots support among Basque nationalists who had tolerated its activities in exchange for working toward the goal of independence.

ETA did announce a definitive ceasefire late last year but the Spanish Government insists the group must lay down its arms and dissolve before they take such declarations seriously. 

The group also declared what it called a permanent ceasefire in 2006 but after negotiations with the government failed the ETA detonated a car bomb at Madrid's airport later that year, killing two people. 

The ministry said Lesaka was one of three hooded ETA members present at the announcement of the October 2011 ceasefire, while Iturbide was linked to the commando unit that set off the airport car bomb.

Wave of arrests: Police at the scene of the arrests that come after ETA's numbers have been decimated by arrests in Spain, France and other countries in recent years

The arrest comes after alleged Basque terrorist Kemen Uranga, 43, was arrested in London after 12 years on the run in August this year.

A suspected Basque terrorist who was on the run for 12 years has been arrested in Britain.

He was detained on an international arrest warrant and is wanted for the murder of a Spanish judge.

Uranga, an alleged member of an ETA command unit in the Basque province of Vizcaya, is believed to have shot dead Spanish judge Jose Lidon at his home in November 2001 with an accomplice. 

He was already on the run from security forces a year before allegedly committing the crime.

Ceasefire: Lesaka is thought to be one of the hooded members present at the group's ceasefire announcement last year which the Spanish Government insists they will not take seriously until the group lays down their arms
