State Farm Insurance has pulled a television ad they created using actor Rob Schneider from the air following a social media outcry over the comedian's controversial opposition to child vaccinations.

The Deuce Bigalow star, 50, caused a stir several years ago when he said that childhood vaccines are the likely cause of autism.

The Saturday Night Live veteran has continued to stand by his views, which have been discredited by the medical community, according to Mediaite.

While Schneider's TV appearance for State Farm Insurance had nothing to do with vaccinations, viewers united in a chorus of condemnation, calling for him to be ousted.

Backlash: The TV ads sparked an outcry on social media, with a subsequent video (pictured) saying Schneider is not an eligible spokesperson for a major insurance company

They claimed that someone who publicly dispels 'dangerous opinions' should not be a spokesman for a major insurance company.

The campaign quickly spread on social media, pushed by a video that asked supporters to post comments on State Farm's Facebook and Twitter pages.

'State Farm provides health insurance, and nothing ensures public health more than getting vaccinated,' the video said.

'It is time to end the anti-vaccination movement; with your help, we can elicit change.'

As a result, State Farm removed the commercial.

'(Schneider's) ad has unintentionally been used as a platform for discussion unrelated to the products and services we provide,' Phil Supple, the insurance company's director of public affairs, told PR Week.

'With that, we are working to remove the ad from our rotation at this time.'

In 2012, Schneider - a father-of-one and member of the Rerpublican Party - publicly opposed California Bill AB 2109.

The bill required parents to better understand the risks and reswards of child vaccinations.

When the bill passed, Schneider hit out the decision on Twitter, Yahoo TV reported.

'Today California passed a law to force parents to get a Doc's permission to not vaccinate their kids or they can't attend school! Nazi's,' he wrote.

Schneider is yet to comment on State Farm's decision regarding the ad.

The commercials first hit TV at the end of August, and didn't take long to spark controversy.

In them Schneider portrays his famous and long-running SNL character, Richmeister.

The ads were developed by DDB Chicago.
