Hundreds of protesters gathered at the headquarters of Egypt's Islamist President Mohammed Morsi today and performed the latest viral dance craze - the Harlem Shake.

About 400 young men, some in funny 
costumes and others bare-chested, rallied in Cairo in front of the main 
office of Morsi's group, The Muslim Brotherhood.

The flash mob danced in protest at country's most powerful Islamic group while chanting "Leave! Leave!" to President Morsi.

The dance brought a rare moment of 
light-hearted expression of dissidence amid Egypt's political turmoil 
that has left dozens dead and hundreds injured in recent months.

As
 the protesters did the Harlem Shake, a dance to a song with the same 
name, the Islamist group shut down its office and turned off the lights.

The protest in Egypt followed the arrest last week in Cairo of four pharmaceutical students.

They were charged with violating the country’s decency laws by dancing in their underwear to the song.

Earlier this 
week Tunisia’s Education Minister Abdellatif Abid was outraged after the performance of the dance in a school in the capital Tunis.

He
 demanded an investigation and has threatened the students with 
expulsion as well as suggesting  the sacking of educational staff.

Videos featuring entire offices dancing to the Harlem Shake by the musician, Baauer, have been piling up on YouTube.

It is the latest dance meme taking the internet by storm following the huge success of K-pop rapper Psy’s smash hit Gangnam Style.

The concept is simple -  the videos are about 30 seconds long and set to Harlem Shake by New York DJ Baauer.

Each clip typically begins with one person gently bopping alone for the first 15 seconds while everyone else ignores them.

Then the bass line drops and everyone goes wild, doing crazy dance moves around the room.

The song belongs to the trap genre of music and every video has put a different twist on the dance routine.

The dance craze was sparked by a group of Australian teenagers who uploaded the 31-second clip called The Harlem Shake v1 (TSCS original) onto YouTube.
