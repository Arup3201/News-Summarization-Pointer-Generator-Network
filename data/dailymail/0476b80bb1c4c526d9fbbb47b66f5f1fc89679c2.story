Sports Direct's icy relations with adidas have taken another turn for the worse after the high street store allegedly reported the German company to the Competition and Markets authority.  

Mike Ashley's Sports Direct have accused the sportswear giants of being 'disingenuous' after a disagreement between the two companies over World Cup kit, according to a report in the business section of the Daily Telegraph.

The row is over the presence of World Cup merchandise and replica football shirts, after adidas refused to supply Sports Direct with current replica jerseys for the teams that it sponsors at the 2014 World Cup, such as Argentina, Germany and Spain. 

Sports Direct have also been left furious after adidas refused to supply them with the World Cup Brazuca match ball and boots. The German sportswear giants are said to be unimpressed by the look and presentation of Sports Direct stores.

Sports Direct's chief executive Dave Forsey told the Daily Telegraph that he believes adidas are concerned over the reductions that Sports Direct offers to customers, saying: 'We believe it is all about price. That is the only conclusion we can come to. How can you justify not supplying us with the World Cup ball. Is it a lower quality of air [in Sports Direct stores]?'

In an interview with the Sunday Telegraph, adidas chief executive Herbert Hainer had previously admitted that the frosty situation needed resolving.

Mr Hainer said: 'Our main objective is definitely to improve the situation with the retail partners. I don't know exactly how many stores Sports Direct has in England, but it is definitely a lot.

'I want to see our brand get good presentation in all these stores, the same with JD.'
