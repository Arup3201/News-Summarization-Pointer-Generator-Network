On Wednesday night,  a thousand students gathered on the prestigious campus to demand justice for Johnson. 

Johnson, who had 10 stitches across his forehead, joined the protests last night, although he did not refer directly to the incident on advice of his lawyer.

'Regardless of your personal opinions and the way you feel about subjects to please respect everyone up here, we're all part of one community,' he told the crowd.

Knocked down: A video shows at least three officers kneeling over Johnson while he's pinned to the ground, and bleeding from a gash on his head

Martese Johnson is an honor student at the prestigious university. He was left with 10 stitches following the altercation with police

'It's about justice,' said Steven Lewis, a graduate student from Atlanta. 

He said he came out to express his 'outrage' over what happened. 'This seemed like the only thing to do.' 

In a video obtained by student newspaper The Cavalier Daily, a bystander shouts that Johnson's head is bleeding and Johnson is heard yelling: 'I go to UVA. You f******* racists. ... How did this happen?

UVA student Bryan Beaubrun said he was with Johnson and photographed the arrest.

Beaubrun said Johnson was trying to get into the Trinity Irish Pub when he was stopped by a bouncer. Then, an ABC officer grabbed Johnson by the arm and pulled him away from the bar to speak with a group of police officers, Beaubrun said.

After about a minute, Beaubrun said, Johnson asked the ABC officer to let go of his arm and tried pulling away from the officer. At that point, another ABC officer grabbed Johnson from behind and the two ABC officers wrestled Johnson to the ground, Beaubrun said. 

Busted up: Johnson is shown in his booking photo with blood coming from his forehead, which required 10 stitches to close, according to a statement from Concerned Black Students

Honor Committee: Johnson is an elected member of the Honor Committee at UVA as well as leadership development chair of the UVA Black Student Alliance

Murdered student Hannah Graham

University of Virginia student Hannah Graham, 18, was found dead in October 

University of Virginia student Hannah Graham, 18, went missing in downtown Charlottesville, Virginia, after leaving a bar at 2am on September 13.

Rolling Stone fraternity rape allegations 

Rolling Stone published a story featuring a UVA junior named 'Jackie' who claimed to have been brutally gang-raped by a group of men at the fraternity during her freshman year

The University of Virginia fraternity was hit with allegations of gang rape in a Rolling Stone article. A police investigation  turned up no evidence of the alleged sexual assault.

Phi Kappa Psi was suspended in November, after Rolling Stone published a story featuring a UVA junior named 'Jackie' who claimed to have been brutally gang-raped by a group of men at the fraternity during her freshman year.

All fraternities and sororities at the Charlottesville, Virginia campus were temporarily suspended in the wake of the controversial article, which provoked protests on campus over the school's relaxed prosecution of sexual assault reports. 

However, the article later came into question when the Washington Post highlighted several discrepancies in the story - throwing doubt on whether the incident.

D'Agostino heir commits suicide 

Peter D'Agostino, 20, was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound

Tragedy struck the already reeling University of Virginia campus in November when a 20-year-old student and heir to New York City supermarket fortune committed suicide.

Peter D'Agostino, 20, was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. 

He was the great-grandson of New York City supermarket chain founder Nicholas D'Agostino Sr. 

He said Johnson hit his head on the ground when he was tackled and that police acted with unnecessary force.

'He didn't need to be tackled. He wasn't being aggressive at all,' Beaubrun said. 

Governor Terry McAuliffe's office released a statement Wednesday that called for state police to examine 'the use of force' by liquor control officers. 

McAuliffe said he is 'concerned by the reports of this incident' at UVA - which is one of the most prestigious public universities in the country. 

Daniel Watkins, an attorney for Johnson, said in a statement that Charlottesville Police charged Johnson with two misdemeanors: obstruction of justice without force and profane swearing and/or intoxication in public. 

The student was released early this morning and has not yet entered a plea to the charges.

'Contrary to early police reports, Mr. Johnson has not been accused of possessing false identification. 

'Just before handcuffing him, police took Martese to the ground, striking his head on the pavement and causing him to bleed profusely from the gash on his head,' Watkins said.

'This morning he received ten stitches at the University of Virginia Medical Center. Fortunately, Martese's physical wounds are beginning to heal.'

He added: 'He holds numerous leadership positions on grounds, including Vice Chair for Community Relations of the Honor Committee, Vice Polemarch of the Eta Sigma Chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi, and a Chair of the Leadership Development Committee of the Black Student Alliance. He has no criminal record.

'As evidenced by both his academic and extracurricular achievements, Martese is a smart young man with a bright future,' Watkins said. 

'I have spoken with him several times today, and he is absolutely devastated by yesterday's events. Currently, we are preparing to investigate and defend this matter vigorously. 

'Please keep Martese in your prayers during this difficult time.' 

Though he's a college junior, Johnson is under the legal drinking age.

According to Charlottesville General District Court records, Johnson was charged with obstruction of justice without force, and public swearing or intoxication.

He was treated at the hospital before being released. 

 University Vice President for Diversity and Equity Marcus L. Martin and Dean of African-American Affairs Maurice Apprey described the incident in a message to students and staff as 'appalling' and said the student's head was 'slammed into the hard pavement with excessive force.' 

'This was wrong and should not have occurred,' Martin and Apprey said in a written statement. 

'We view the nature of this assault as highly unusual and appalling based on the information we have received.'

The ABC issued a statement saying that 'uniformed ABC Agents observed and approached' an unidentified individual 'after he was refused entry to a licensed establishment' about 12:45 a.m. at an area of bars and restaurants near campus known as 'the Corner.'

The ABC said the unidentified individual received injuries while being arrested and was treated at a local hospital before being released.

The ABC said the agents involved with the arrest are being restricted to administrative duties while a state police investigation is underway.

ABC agents in Charlottesville have been accused of heavy-handed actions in the past.

The state of Virginia reached a $212,500 settlement last year with a UVA student who was arrested after her purchase of water was mistaken for beer.

Elizabeth Daly fled in terror outside a Charlottesville supermarket in April 2013 when her vehicle was swarmed by state ABC agents who mistook her just-purchased carton of sparkling water for beer.

According to Daly's lawsuit, badges worn around the casually dressed ABC agents' necks were not clearly visible and the defendants did not verbally identify themselves as officers.

Daly was charged with eluding police and assaulting a police officer after her SUV grazed two of the agents. 

The arrest provoked a public outcry, and the charges were dropped.
