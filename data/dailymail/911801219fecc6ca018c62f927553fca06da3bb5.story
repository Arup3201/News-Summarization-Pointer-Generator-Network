An anonymous note left on a woman's front door asking her to not wear a bikini while gardening because she is 'fat' has sparked outrage.

The yellow post-it note was left at the entrance to a  woman's house, and said 'I don't appreciate fat people wearing bikinis/short shorts when watering. Please cover up or I will report you.'

The note went on to say, 'You disgust me. I didn't move here for this. Also, cover up when walking your cat.'

The unidentified woman from Bundaberg in Queensland told NewsMail that the note completely shocked her, and left her feeling as though she wasn't free to be herself in her own home.

Social media users have slammed the note as 'cowardly', 'rude', 'tactless', and 'sick'. 

'Whoever wrote that note and left it on the lady's front door is nothing but scum, why didn't she confront the lady instead of the note , because whoever did it is gutless and cruel,' said one commenter. 

'(I was) shocked, horrified and angry at why someone could do this and leave a note instead of talking to me about it,' the Bundaberg woman said. 

She received support from many in her Bundaberg community, with one commenter pointing out that 'the lady wearing what she likes, when she likes and where she likes, is her business, and to the low life scum bag that left the note, get a life.'

Researchers at the University of London have found that those who are made to feel ashamed about their size are six times as likely to become obese, a study has found.

Experts say that being criticised for their weight drives those who are already sensitive about it to comfort eat. Fear of ridicule may also mean they avoid exercise.  

The study involved almost 3,000 men and women aged 50-plus who were weighed twice, four years apart. They were also asked if they had been discriminated against because of their weight.

Examples of this included being treated with disrespect – including being the butt of jokes – receiving poorer service in shops, restaurants, hospitals and doctors’ surgeries, being threatened and being assumed to be stupid.

One social media user supported these findings, calling for body image and self-confidence to be put into perspective. 

Another said, 'Very few of us have flawless figures so I suggest that the individual that felt the need to write this note take a good hard look at themselves first before passing judgement upon others,'

'This individual has well and truly overstepped the mark of common decency. To the lady concerned just continue to be yourself and wear what you are comfortable in.'

The Bundaberg woman seemed to take this advice to heart saying that, 'now, I'm like stuff it, why should I be afraid to run around in my bikinis when it's hot.' 

Another of her supporters applauded this sentiment, telling her to 'Stay strong Bundy lady, keep wearing your bikini and shorts.'
