John Mead, 76, a private school teacher who molested schoolboys during the 1970s, has been jailed for three years

A former grammar school teacher who organised school trips to youth hostels so he could abuse young boys in his care has been jailed for three years.

John Mead, was a physics and maths master at fee-paying Queen Elizabeth Grammar School in Blackburn, Lancashire, when he attacked three boys, all aged under 13, during the 1970s.

When the allegations came to light he claimed he was the victim of a 'post Jimmy Savile witchhunt' saying that the complaints were made up because historic sex abuse cases were in the news.

But at Preston Crown Court Judge Christopher Cornwall dismissed his claims and jailed him for three years.

The court heard that he had a ‘sinister motive’ for organising the excursions to places including the Lake District for young boys. 

Once there he played games like ‘monsters in the dark’ indecently assaulting youngsters by pulling them on to a bed and groping them.

Mead, a 76-year-old father-of-three, of Sabden, Lancashire, was convicted of four counts of indecently assaulting three pupils at the Blackburn school during the 1970s after a trial.

During one of the trips, the jury heard how he got into bed with a pupil who was sleeping in a single room before reaching over him and touching him inappropriately.

Another was assaulted by Mead during a game of ‘monsters in the dark’ in which his teacher grabbed him, pulled him onto the bed and groped him.

And a third complainant was indecently assaulted on multiple occasions when Mead got into the shower with him during the trips.

At court Mead tried to argue that he should not be jailed because he suffers from myalgic encephalomyelitis, which is also known as chronic fatigue syndrome.

Mead had maintained he was innocent throughout the entire five day trial, claiming the victims’ accusations were ‘fantasy’.

Judge Cornwall said: 'You suggest that you have been cleverly set up by unscrupulous pupils. I utterly and reservedly reject what you say.'

The court heard that one victim filed a complaint to police in 2000 but no action was taken.

In 2006 another victim reported the abuse to police and even penned a letter to QEGS yet no action was taken by police.

In 2013 the previous complaint of the boy was renewed and the matter was investigated by police.

Officers went to the Lancashire school and discovered the separate allegation through the letter that had been written seven years prior.

It was said to have helped provide 'compelling support' of the allegations being made.

The third victim, who had since moved abroad saw a news report in 2013 that a former QEGS teacher had been arrested. 

Despite Mead not being named or charged, the victim knew 'instinctively' that it related to Mead and contacted the police.

Judge Cornwall added: 'This is not the Jimmy Savile effect. Jimmy Savile died in October 2011, it was only after his death that allegations began to be made about the sexual misconduct in his lifetime.'

He added that the victims of Mead had made complaints well before the Savile case came to light - adding that one had complained nine years prior to Savile’s death.

Judge Cornwall added: 'You believed it had been buried without trace. It was and remains beyond comprehension to you. 

'Your behaviour 40 years ago came back to haunt you after such an elapsing time. Justice comes limping along. The crime has been committed, the perpetrator appears to have got away with it. 

'Time passes, seemingly the matter is forgotten but it hasn’t been forgotten.

'It hasn’t been forgotten for one powerful reason, the victims have to live on a day to day basis with the consequences of what you did.'

He added that the victims had feared that they wouldn’t be believed and people would not be interested.

He said they had felt 'disempowered' that nothing had been said or done at the time but that it was common for victims to respond in that way.

Judge Cornwall said: 'Three boys complained. That is three boys too many.'

He added that he had admiration for the victims in coming forward but said that it would not diminish the 'enduring pain suffered by the three'.

As well as being jailed he was also placed on the sex offenders register for life and was made the subject of a Sexual Offences Prevention Order.

Andrew Nuttall, in mitigation, said that Mead had been of good character. He said: 'There is a serious breach of trust perpetrated by the defendant on young boys in his care. 

'All the good work that he has ever done will be forgotten because of these offences. It is a fact he has made a positive and has had a positive effect on many people, not just in the school but in his life. 

'He understands that will be forgotten, for the rest of his life, the 76 years will be as if they counted for nothing at all. He will now have to pay the price.'

DS Julie Cross from East Division Public Protection Unit said: 'I am pleased with the custodial sentence handed down to Mead today and I hope it brings some closure to his victims so that they start to move on with their lives.

'We are committed to investigating all allegations of this nature thoroughly and sensitively. Anyone who has been the victim of similar offences can contact us and be confident that we will listen to them and investigate in a similarly measured way.'
