Former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash accused Andy Murray of collapsing in the latter stages of his Australian Open final defeat to Novak Djokovic and believes he needs to learn from his mistakes.

After the first two sets were split in two hours and 32 minutes, Murray looked to be in command against an ailing Djokovic when he broke for a 2-0 lead in the third.

However, from then on the 27-year-old Scot won just one of the next 13 games as a rejuvenated Djokovic raised his game to secure a fifth Australian Open and eighth grand slam title with a 7-6 (7/5) 6-7 (4/7) 6-3 6-0 win in three hours and 39 minutes.

Murray admitted he was distracted by Djokovic's fluctuating physical condition and Cash said: 'Things just started snowballing for Murray once he lost that concentration when everything was going his way

'He hasn't put up a great fight, he hasn't. He absolutely collapsed. Sorry but you don't put a rose tint on this. He melted down, he's been disappointing and the bottom line is, the situation got too much.'

Speaking during commentary on BBC Radio Five Live, 1987 Wimbledon champion Cash added: 'He has to look at it and say "I can't do this again. What has gone wrong, what did I do wrong?" It's the same stuff that's happened his whole career.

'He needs to find the right balance, the right balance between attack and defence. He'll be sat there thinking "what happened, what did I do, I'm a disgrace, I've let everyone down", but he'll learn from it.'

Murray has not beaten a world No 1 since defeating Djokovic in the 2013 Wimbledon final and Cash added: 'If he wants to beat these guys then he has to start learning from this. He's a seriously good player but if he wants to be a great player then he has to fix this element.

'He has to have a good hard look in the mirror and he's needed to have a good hard look in the mirror for a long time. [Former coach] Ivan Lendl said "Listen son, pull your head together".

'He's got to focus and look at why he had the meltdown. If he works on that part of his game then I can see him holding the Wimbledon trophy but he's got to look in the mirror. This is not the worst thing for him to be, I'd almost say embarrassed, and hopefully he'll learn from it.'
