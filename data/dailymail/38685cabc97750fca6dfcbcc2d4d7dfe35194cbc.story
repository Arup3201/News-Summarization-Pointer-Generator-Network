Leicester have been offered the chance to sign former Chelsea winger Florent Malouda.

The 34-year-old has one year left on contract but will be allowed to leave on a free as his club Trabzonspor look to cut back on their wage bill.

Malouda is on a reputed £50,000 a week and that will be a big obstacle to any deal at Leicester.Manager Nigel Pearson has identified his attack as something that needs strengthening.

Offered: Leicester have been given the chance to sign former Chelsea player Florent Malouda

On the verge: Leonardo Ulloa is close to completing a £7.5m move from Brighton

He has signalled £7.5m to be spent on Leonardo Ulloa from Brighton - a deal that will rise to a staggering £10m eventually - while a package is close to being agreed with Fraizer Campbell from Cardiff also and an interest has been posted in Sporting Lisbon's Islam Slimani.

Leicester have also had a bid turned down for Watford's Troy Deeney who has attracted enquiries and bids from Burnley, Swansea, Aston Villa and QPR.

The club will look at free agents but won't compromise their budget too much by paying over the odds on wages.

Watford meanwhile have made a £1.2million offer for Leicester's Andy King while forward Jamie Vardy is expected to agree a new four year contract soon.
