The former wives of two NFL players have revealed they were told to keep quiet about domestic violence by the teams their husbands played for.

Mercedes Sands, who was married to a player from the Cincinnati Bengals, and Brandie Underwood who married a member of the Green Bay Packers, have told of feeling trapped in abusive relationships and how the NFL's culture of silence and inclusiveness left them feeling like they couldn't seek help.  

The women spoke out as the NFL continues to be rocked by a domestic violence scandal that began when video emerged in September of Ray Rice knocking his then-fiancée to the ground in a hotel elevator. Four other cases of domestic violence have since come to light.

Mercedes Sands, who was married to Cincinnati Bengals player Robert Sands, left, and Brandie Underwood, who married Brandon Underwood of the Green Bay Packers, right, have spoken out saying they were told to keep quiet about domestic violence by the teams their husbands played for

Speaking to The New York Times, Ms Sands told how she started fighting with her husband Robert just months after they married in 2011 - something that soon came to the attention of the Bengals team management.

In January 2012, Ms Sands knocked herself unconscious after driving her car into a neighbor's house while trying to flee her husband. 

Within days, the team's head coach Marvin Lewis chaired a meeting between her and Mr Sands, she recalled. He told them to seek counselling, but also advised them to reach out to the Bengals first if there were further problems, rather than authorities, as police attention would prompt adverse media interest.

Ms Underwood, 28, who left her partner Brandon in 2011, said the wives of players often felt like the team was 'all you have'.   

She said:'Other than them, I knew nobody. You come to this town when your husband is drafted, and you get kind of pushed into this group. It is how you get your friends - your support system.' 

Ms Underwood said other wives told her not to cause a fuss, as it could affect the harmony and success of their husbands' team. They were to put up with Infidelity and even if they reached breaking point within their marriages, they were told to just keep quiet, she said. 

Ms Sands said to begin with, she kept quiet. She didn't call the police, and instead raised issued with the Bengals' player relations coordinator. He would take calls 24 hours a day, and sometimes defused arguments at their home in the middle of the night, she said. 

Her husband told her if she complained to police it could threaten his position within the team, and ultimately their livelihood, she claimed.  

Mr Sands, who is now with the Edmonton Eskimos in the Canadian Football League, said he had only ever physically abused Ms Sands and had never physically assaulted her.  

He confirmed her reports that the Bengals wanted to keep problems away from authorities. 

The NFL continues to be rocked by allegations of violence by its players, a scandal that was sparked by a video, seen above, of Ray Rice, punching his partner to the ground in September 

But the club told the newspaper that they never told the couple not to involve the police, rather, they said the couple were told to work on their problems and make use of the services available to them. 

Ms Sands was just 22, when she moved from Miami to Cincinnati. The Bengals became her second family, she said. The team hosted her and her husband for thanksgiving and the Bengals later threw her and other expectant mothers a baby shower.  

But less than a week after the baby shower, everything changed, and Ms Sands said she became an outcast. 

In January 2013 she called police to report Ms Sands had choked her while putting his weight on her stomach. He was arrested, just one day before a play-off game.  

The support systems then went silence, Ms Sands, now 25, recalled. 

Mr Sands cancelled her credit card and emptied their joint account, she said, and during the final weeks of her pregnancy Ms Sands relied on food stamps and church handouts. 

For Ms Underwood, the ups and downs, happened daily. 

In one incident in June 2011, after they had celebrated the Packers' Super Bowl victory, she recalled how her husband  ripped a necklace off her neck and threw her out of his parked car before driving away.

When police arrived Ms Underwood didn't say what had taken place, but according to officers she had said she wanted to make a point to her husband that he couldn't 'keep doing this to me'. Mr Underwood was arrested.

An investigation into recent domestic violence cases involved NFL players, showed that in many cases the women, stood by their partners, even while they were being prosecuted. 

Ray Rice - In September video was released of the Baltimore Ravens player punching his then-fiancée to the ground in a hotel elevator. Rice was initially suspended for just two weeks, but as outrage intensified, he was then released from his team and suspended indefinitely.

Adrian Peterson - The Minnesota Vikings player is facing child abuse charges over disciplining his son, four, with a switch. Peterson was initially allowed to keep playing, but was later banned from playing until the case is resolved. He continues to be paid. 

Greg Hardy - The Carolina Panthers defensive end was found guilty in July of assaulting and threatening his girlfriend. He is appealing the case. He has also been barred from playing while the matter is before the courts, but continues to get paid.

Jonathan Dwyer - The Arizona Cardinals player was arrested in September for two domestic violence incidents involving a woman, 27 and an 18-month-old child. He is on bail and has been deactivated from all team activities. 

Ray McDonald - The San Francisco 49ers defensive end was arrested in August on felony domestic charges related to an altercation with his girlfriend. He was bailed and his continued to take the field for his team. The team's CEO has said he wants to see clear evidence of wrongdoing before punishing the player.

A career in the NFL, on average, only last three years, something Ms Underwood said she was acutely aware of. If she spoke out, she feared she would affect her husbands career. 

Ms Underwood told how her life changed overnight after her husband landed a four-year $1.8million contract. She was then welcomed into the Packers' family and a life of luxury.

But a week after the birth of the couple's third son, in June 2010, Mr Underwood told her he was being investigated for sexually assaulting two women. He later pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor prostitution charge.  

Ms Underwood said she was encouraged by the Packers' management and other wives, to stand by her husband. She felt trapped: 'They are more worried about protecting a team's name or player than a wife.'

She made plans to divorce him the following year and left him about two months after the night he chucked her out of his car. Mr Underwood later pleaded no contest to a disorderly conduct charge over the incident.  

Ms Underwood then moved home, to a town near Dayton, Ohio, and began waiting tables. She did not hear from the Packers' again.

The team refused to comment on the Underwoods case to the newspaper. 

Mr Underwood was suspended for two games under the NFL's personal conduct policy, although it is not known whether it was for the prostitution charge or the episode where Ms Underwood was pushed out of his car. The Packers dropped him before the 2011 season.

Brian McCarthy, an NFL spokesman, said teams had offered a variety of resources to players or family members for years, including referrals for counseling services. In 2012 the league started the NFL Life Line, a free, confidential phone consultation service to assist current and former players, as well as coaches and family members.
