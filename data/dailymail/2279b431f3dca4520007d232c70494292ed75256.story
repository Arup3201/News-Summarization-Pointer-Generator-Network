SeaWorld is facing more scrutiny after a dolphin at one of its parks bit a nine-year-old girl earlier this month.

The beleaguered park’s San Antonio Dolphin Cove has come under fire from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals after a dolphin bit the young girl during a February 22nd visit with her family.

PETA has asked Texas authorities to investigate the park because it allows visitors to touch the sea mammals, which it calls an ‘animal welfare violation,’ according to a complaint obtained by ABC News.

CHomp: THe dolphin latched on to the nine-year-old girl's hand strongly enough to require park staff to force it to release her

A picture released by the animal rights group shows the dolphin chomping down on the girl’s hand as she reaches out to pet it.

A PETA spokesperson claimed to ABC that the dolphin bit the hand so tightly that park staff had to force it to let go.

‘This incident and exhibit clearly endangered both the dolphin and the public,’ a PETA lawyer claims before citing Texas laws that require ‘sufficient distance and/or barriers between animal and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of animals and the public.’

Another PETA lawyer argued in the complaint that the park’s entire concept is flawed.

‘It’s stressful enough for far-ranging dolphins to be locked up in SeaWorld’s tiny tanks, but forcing them to interact with visitors is downright dangerous.

‘SeaWorld’s ‘Dolphin Cove’ is another example of how the park’s main priority is profit, not the welfare of the animals or the safety of its guests,’ he continued.

Flawed: PETA says allowing humans to go so closely to humans, and even be touched by them, is in violation of the animal welfare act

SeaWorld has more than 100 incidents of animal aggression at is multiple parks on record, the PETA spokesperson claimed to ABC.

The unidentified girl sustained bite marks and swelling to her hand, PETA told ABC.

SeaWorld claims it is looking into the incident and cooperating with USDA investigators.

MailOnline was not immediately able to reach the USDA for comment.

This is just the latest bad PR for SeaWorld since the Blackfish documentary came out and a trainer was killed in 2010 by Tilikum, a 1,300-pound killer whale at the Orlando park.

The trainer was the third person to die as a result of aggression by the animal, according to reports.
