Team news

Sunderland

Tottenham

Tottenham new boys Federico Fazio and Benjamin Stambouli could be in line to play some part in Saturday's Barclays Premier League clash at Sunderland.

Both could make their debuts at the Stadium of Light after head coach Mauricio Pochettino confirmed he expects them to travel following their arrivals towards the end of the transfer window.
