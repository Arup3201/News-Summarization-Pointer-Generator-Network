The widow of a man who died after waiting almost an hour for an ambulance said yesterday that she was ‘disgusted’ after it emerged that bosses at the trust responsible for the delays had won an award for ‘excellence’.

Joyce Pring, 63, said she was ‘astounded’ to see photographs of staff from the Welsh Ambulance Service Trust (WAST) ‘living it up’ at taxpayers’ expense as they celebrated at the prize ceremony.

The award – which was given to the trust despite it repeatedly missing patient targets – was handed over just months after an inquest into the death of her husband of 38 years, Fred.

Angry: Fred and Joyce Pring. Mr Pring died at his home, near Mold, after the ambulance turned up late

In heartbreaking testimony, the inquest was told how Mrs Pring, a retired civil servant, made four increasingly desperate 999 calls begging for an ambulance to come and help her 74-year-old husband, eventually telling operators: ‘It’s too late now, he’s gone.’

It later emerged that as Mrs Pring was making her calls, six of the 16 ambulances serving her area had been on mandatory rest breaks, another eight were queuing outside two hospitals to hand over patients, and the remaining two were dealing with other incidents.

When the inquest concluded, coroner John Gittins criticised the service and demanded action from the trust to reduce the risks posed by paramedics taking mandatory breaks and delays in dropping off patients at A&E.

But within weeks of the hearing, bosses were applying for the GateHouse Award for Excellence in Organisational Development. And, despite consistently failing to meet the Government’s target that ambulances should attend at least 65 per cent of the most serious call-outs within eight minutes, the trust won the Healthcare People Management Association award.

Staff attended a ceremony in London earlier this month to pick it up. Pictures from the night show them dancing and celebrating after their win.

Mrs Pring, of Mynydd Isa, near Mold, North Wales, said she was ‘astounded’ by the award.

‘It is unbelievable that a trust which, month after month, fails to achieve its targets is actually being rewarded for incompetence,’ she said.

‘They are missing targets and people are dying because of it.

‘I don’t think the general public are aware that they are wasting time putting themselves up for these kind of awards when their performance is so dire – for them to win it beggars belief.

‘What really grates is that they were preparing to submit their application for this award when the inquest was taking place. It makes me so angry, it’s such an insult. I wouldn’t mind if they had made changes outlined after my husband’s inquest and gave themselves some time before applying, but the fact they did this at the time of the inquest is horrifying.’

Mrs Pring said she was particularly offended by pictures on social media of WAST staff ‘living it up’ at the awards party. ‘The photo showing the representatives all dressed up enjoying themselves is an insult to the people who are no longer here,’ she added.

Mrs Pring complained to her representative in the Welsh Assembly, Tory Mark Isherwood, who described the award as a ‘sick joke’. ‘What the WAST have done is at best insensitive,’ he said. ‘They are missing these targets month on month.’

Figures for May 2014 show that only 54.1 per cent of ambulances in Wales arrived at the scene of a life-threatening category A call within eight minutes – down from 62.5 per cent the previous year. The WAST has met the target in just one month over the past two years.

In response to an email of complaint from Mrs Pring to the WAST, a spokesman said: ‘The trust acknowledges that our emergency response times have been consistently below target for some time and recognises we must change this urgently.

‘The trust is working diligently in order to develop our clinical practice. Therefore at each opportunity where our staff have contributed to the trust moving closer to this goal we want to celebrate, recognise and announce our pride in our workforce.’
