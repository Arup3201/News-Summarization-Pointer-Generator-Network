There's never a doll moment in Sue King's household at Halloween ... especially in the dead of night. 

For that's when her collection of porcelain playthings come alive with the mischievous souls of deceased children, she claims.

The 52-year-old grandmother, from Toledo, Ohio, has amassed 200 dolls in three years, and believes each one is haunted by the spirit of a dead youngster. 

'It might sound creepy,' she says, 'but I genuinely believe that my dolls have been possessed by the ghosts of children who have passed away.' 

So instead of bobbing apples and trick-or-treating tonight, Sue will be dressing up her porcelein babies in costumes of the undead while keeping an eye out for their pranks.

Never a doll moment: Instead of bobbing apples and trick-or-treating, Sue King, 52, from Toledo, Ohio, will be doting on her porcelain dolls - who she believes are haunted by the spirits of dead children

Fanatic: Sue, who also has eight grandchildren, first began collecting haunted dolls in 2011 after spotting one at a flea market. She now has more than 200

'They're really naughty and are always playing tricks on me,' she said. 'The radio will come on in the middle of the night, or the oven will switch off while I'm cooking.

'Once, when I was doing the washing up in the kitchen, all the cupboards flew open and then I heard a tiny giggle from another room.

'On another occasion, one of them bit me in the shower.

'It's hard to stay angry at them though, because I love them so much.' 

She says it's her supernatural instinct that has brought her closer to the figurines - who she says she loves just as much as her eight real-life grandchildren.

'I've always been spiritual, and I just have a sense for these kinds of things,' she adds. 'I believe it is my destiny for these dolls and I to be family. I love my dolls as much as I love my own grandchildren, and I know they love me back.'

This year, Sue will be continuing her annual tradition of treating her dolls to a spook-tacular Halloween.

Once a year, she decks out her house with creepy decorations including spiders, ghouls and hand-carved pumpkins so her dolls can join in on the fun.

Sue said: 'As soon as I saw her, I knew she wasn't just an ordinary doll. There was something so mysterious about her.

Tragic: She says every doll  has its own tragic story - often they were abused, or were unloved by their parents

Three years later, Sue has amassed an impressive collection of more than 200 porcelain dolls - spending a total of £5,000

Most of them are bought on eBay, whilst she also spots them at local flea markets and charity shops

'I took her home with me and as I was settling her down on the couch, I heard a little voice say 'Help me'.

'I looked her straight in the eye, and then she told me that her name was Hazel.

'From then on, I knew that there were other dolls like her out there, and I wanted to help them.'
