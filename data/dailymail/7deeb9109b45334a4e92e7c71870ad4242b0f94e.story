The sick father of British hostage John Cantlie yesterday issued a heartbreaking plea from a hospital bed for his son’s release.

In a direct televised appeal to Islamic State, Paul Cantlie, 80, who has throat cancer, asked his jihadist captors to return him home safely to those who love him.

He said his efforts to communicate with the militants had only been met with silence and he could only hope they had received them.

Speaking from a hospital bed, John Cantlie's father Paul has appealed for his son to be freed by ISIS militants

His sole contact with his son in nearly two years has been three video clips showing Mr Cantlie speaking, one in which he says he may die.

Mr Cantlie, a 43-year-old photojournalist, was first shown in a propaganda video last month, where he claimed he had been ‘abandoned’ by the Government and pleaded with them to negotiate with his captors.

The slickly-made video, which had Arabic subtitles, marked a significant change of tactics by IS, which had previously released barbaric footage of hostages being executed in a desert.

Two more videos were later released, one on Monday night, showing Mr Cantlie, who was abducted in November 2012, speaking out against US action in Iraq and Syria.

In an emotional appeal, Mr Cantlie describes how 'very proud' he is of John and tells his captors that his son is a 'good man'

Widower Mr Cantlie, from Hampshire, was speaking with the help of a voice aid, having had surgery for throat cancer. At times he is shown holding his hand to his throat as he struggles to speak and some of his words are barely comprehensible.

Speaking about watching the original footage of his son, he said: ‘For the first time in almost two years, we saw John when he made a televised broadcast during which he told viewers that he was still a prisoner of the Islamic State and that maybe he will live and maybe he will die.

‘As a family we experienced great relief seeing and hearing John and knowing that he is alive. This was followed by the feeling of despair and helplessness.’

Mr Cantlie explained how his son was seized in northern Syria, where he had been working as an independent photojournalist. He added: ‘John felt a strong need to help in the best way that he could: as an impartial and respected journalist he knew that he could make a difference by acting as a platform for the world to listen to and take notice, using his journalistic skills for the good of the people, as a friend and as a civilian.’ In the five-and-a-half minute clip, recorded by the BBC, Mr Cantlie spoke of how he was proud of his son and was desperate to see him again.

‘Speaking entirely for myself, this is not how I had imagined I would be passing my 81st year. I want John to know how very proud I am of him. I can think of no greater joy than seeing my dear son released and allowed to return home to us,’ he said.

Mr Cantlie said he and his family are trying to communicate with the Islamic State to deliver an ‘important message regarding John’ and said they can only hope that it has been received but they have had no response.

Addressing his son’s captors, he said: ‘To those holding John: please know that he is a good man, he sought only to help the Syrian people and I ask you from all that is sacred, to help us and allow him to return home safely to those he loves and those who love him.’

The appeal was initiated by Mr Cantlie’s family who wanted to make contact with the militants. It was approved by the Foreign Office which provided support and advice to the family.  

Propaganda videos posted by ISIS have shown the British hostage criticising Obama's military strategy for combating the terror group, while appearing to read from a script

Mr Cantlie tells his son's captors that John Cantlie felt a 'strong need to help in the best way that he could' as an 'impartial and respected journalist'

'My name is Paul Cantlie. My son John Henry Cantlie has been held as a prisoner by the Islamic State since 2012.

'For the first time in almost two years, we saw John when he made a televised broadcast during which he told viewers that he was still a prisoner of the Islamic State and that maybe he will live and maybe he will die.

'As a family we experienced great relief seeing and hearing John and knowing that he is alive. This was followed by the feeling of despair and helplessness.

'He was seized in northern Syria, where he had been working as an independent photo journalist, seeking out the true story of the suffering of the Syrian people and ensuring the world was made aware of their plight.

'John felt a strong need to help in the best way that he could: as an impartial and respected journalist he knew that he could make a difference by acting as a platform for the world to listen to and take notice, using his journalistic skills for the good of the people; as a friend and as a civilian.

'I have had many messages saying they cannot conceive what we, his family & all those who love him, must be feeling.

'Speaking entirely for myself, this is not how I had imagined I would be passing my 81st year. I want John to know how very proud I am of him. I can think of no greater joy than seeing my dear son again, released and allowed to return to those that love him.

'My family and I are trying to communicate with the Islamic State to deliver an important message regarding John and can only hope that it has been received as we have had no response. 

'To those holding John: please know that he is a good man. He sought only to help the Syrian people and I ask you from all that is sacred, to help us and allow him to return home safely to those he loves and who love him.'
