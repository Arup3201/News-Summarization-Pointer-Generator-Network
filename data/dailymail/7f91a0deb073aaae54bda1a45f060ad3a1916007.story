This was the moment an angry ram let off some steam by taking out a flying drone with his horns and knocking it TO the ground in New Zealand.

The up close and personal footage was filmed by YouTube user Buddhanz1 using a quadcopter drone and has been viewed 68,029 times. 

Buddhanz1, who has nicknamed the animal Rambo, says on the YouTube channel he was looking for a newborn lamb whose mum cannot produce enough milk. 

 

YouTube user Buddhanz1 says he was looking for a baby lamb with his flying camera 

The video starts by showing the beautiful rolling hills of the countryside before zooming into the area where Rambo is having a grassy snack. 

He starts to examine the camera as it closes in as he is trying to finish his leaf lunch.

It seems he didn't take too kindly to being interrupted and after a few inquisitive stares he looks like he is taking a few steps back before he lurches forward twice and takes out the drone with his horns.

The footage then cuts to the owner of the drone walking towards the ram saying 'Rambo the ram, what are you doing boy, where is it?'

But instead he stumbled across Rambo who  is just having lunch when he is interrupted by the spy camera 

He takes an inquisitive look at what the device is that is capturing his every move before ramming it into a bush

The cameraman then locates the broken drone in a bush nearby. 

When he starts to leave the pilot is seen being chased by Rambo who doesn't seem too happy. 

The pilot tells Rambo to 'settle down boy' several times and is seen trying to keep him at arms length with a stick. 

Some viewers have not taken too kindly to the video, Kenneth Heal5 said: 'You have a duty of care and respect to ensure you don't fly that low. 

'Ending up that low is either negligence, incompetence or both. Guess u got your punishment already though.' 

Rambo gets up close and personal with the camera before using his horns to show what he thinks

Buddhanz1 defended himself saying: 'I was looking for the angry ram with my FPV quadcopter. 

'I got a bit close & he managed to hit it knocking it into a bush, luckily no harm done. 

 'When I went to retrieve it he followed me, I had my hands full so he got me pretty good.'
