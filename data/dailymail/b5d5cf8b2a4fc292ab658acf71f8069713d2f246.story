Jack is no ordinary Pit Bull. 'Jack is a hero,' says his Florida owner Sherrie Lewis. The dog protected Lewis' cat, named Kitty, from a bunch of coyotes.

'As I was walking to the door, I could see the coyotes over here,' she motioned.   

'It happened in an instant at the Seminole neighborhood. One had her by the neck and the other had her by the tail,' she told My Fox Tampa Bay.

Friends for life: Jack won't leave Kitty's side after she was attacked by coyotes and he ran to save her

Jack ran as fast as he could to defend Kitty.  Jack attacked the coyotes who eventually let go of their injured prey.

Kitty was taken  to the vet and is being treated for brain swelling and a broken tooth.She can't walk yet but 'she's getting there,' said Lewis.

Jack is making sure Kitty remains comfortable during her healing process.

'He probably feels like he's the caretaker.  He checks on her every day and sniffs her, seeing what kind of shape she is in,' said Sherree Lewis.

Jack continues to watch out for coyotes to return. He stands guard staring at the mangroves behind Sherrie's house waiting for trouble to arrive. 

Sherrie hired trappers to set up traps behind the mangroves where Sherrie believes the Coyotes must have come from.

Sherrie said Jack was able to identify a predator, 'He likes other dogs he wouldn't have done that if there were dogs out there. It was like he knew the difference,' she said.

Both pets were rescue animals and were adopted by Sherrie and her son Peter. Sherrie is watching Jack for her son who is deployed in Afghanistan. Little did she know Jack would be a fighter as well.
