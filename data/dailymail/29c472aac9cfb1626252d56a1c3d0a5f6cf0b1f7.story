A man who died after being Tasered by police by a 50,000-volt stun gun was not breaking into the property as thought but visiting friends for a quiet birthday drink, a friend has claimed. 

Adrian Thompson became unresponsive after being bundled into a police car and taken into custody in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, having been stunned. 

A call to the police suggested he was breaking into the property, but a friend has now insisted the 34-year-old had been invited to the scene in the early hours of Monday morning. 

His death is now being investigated by the Independent Press Complaints Commission.

Adrian Thompson, 34, died after being Tasered by police at a property in Staffordshire 

'There was no burglary at the property. Adrian had come round for a few quiet drinks for my birthday,' said Paul Carter, who lives in the flat. 

'Police were called when he became distressed as we wanted help for him. Adrian was a brilliant character.' 

Staffordshire Police however said it was called to the scene following reports of a burglary.

'The occupants of the house had left before officers arrived – leaving the man inside. 

'During the incident, a taser was discharged by officers and the man was then taken to a police vehicle.

'While in the vehicle, the man became unresponsive and despite the efforts of paramedics from West Midlands Ambulance Service, he unfortunately died a short time later,' a statement read. 

The incident is now being investigated by the Independent Police Complains Commission. When contacted by MailOnline, the Commission said it could not comment on Mr Carter's claims.  

Commissioner Kathryn Stone OBE added: 'I would like to express my sincere condolences to the man’s family at this difficult time.

Death: A man has died after being shot with a Taser stun gun by police at a home in Newcastle-under-Lyme

Investigation: The incident came after police allegedly received reports of burglary

'We are at a very early stage of our independent investigation into the actions police took at the scene.

'We will be examining closely police involvement in this incident and the circumstances surrounding the man’s death.'

Mr Thompson's death comes after Matthew Williams died after being shot with a stun gun. The 34-year-old had launched a horrific attack on Cerys Yem at a hostel where he was staying after being released from prison. 

Miss Yemm was allegedly murdered by Williams who ‘ate her face while high on cocaine’ in Caerphilly, South Wales. Police discharged the Taser after finding the 22-year-old unconscious with severe facial injuries.

Solicitor Sophie Khan, from the Police Action Centre, has now called on Theresa May to consider a temporary ban on Tasers. She said stun guns are a ‘real threat to life and their use must now be curbed’.

Neighbour Mark Finney, 50, said: ‘I was asleep and at around 1.30am, I woke up and heard shouting and tremendous banging. It sounded like someone was in distress.’

A 22-year-old local resident, who did not want to be named, said he heard the Taser victim shout ‘help me’ after the stun gun was fired at around 1.45am. He added: ‘There were seven or eight police and I saw them dragging this bloke out.

‘He was still alive then but he looked like he was drunk or something. They were carrying him with their arms under his shoulders. They bunged him in the back of the van.’

Police: Officers at the scene in the aftermath of the fatal Taser shooting in the early hours

Block: The incident and subsequent death happened at these flats in Newcastle-under-Lyme

On guard: A police officer at the scene with a Taser holstered on his jacket

Probe: The Independent Police Complaints Commission will be investigating the man's death

Quiet: The incident took place in the suburb of Chesterton just outside Newcastle-under-Lyme

An IPCC report revealed in July that Staffordshire officers had used Tasers as ‘a deterrent’ 619 times in the past nine years.

Between 2012 and 2013, the force fired stun guns a total of 71 times – more than three times more than similar-sized forces such as Leicestershire and West Mercia Police.

The weapons have been linked to at least ten deaths in England and Wales over the past decade.

Staffordshire’s police and crime commissioner Matthew Ellis said it was ‘immensely sad’ that a man had lost his life, but added that it would be inappropriate to comment further during an ongoing IPCC investigation.
