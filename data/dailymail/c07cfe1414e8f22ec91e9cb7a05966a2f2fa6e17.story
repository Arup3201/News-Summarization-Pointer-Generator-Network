You would have to look closely for one of its obscure entrances in the French capital of Paris.

But should you stumble upon one, it reveals an underground world of the dark, dank, narrow tunnels with a fascinating history.

Below the City of Light's 12million residents lie the remains of 6million others - known as France's Empire of the Dead, a world which is brought to life in a new documentary on CNN.

The Paris catacombs are a 200-mile network of old caves, tunnels and quarries - and much of it is filled with the skulls and bones of the dead.

Much of the catacombs are 
out of bounds to the public, making it illegal to explore unsupervised.

But nevertheless, it is a powerful draw for a hardcore group of explorers with a thirst for adventure.

A tourist-friendly, legal entrance can be found off Place Denfert-Rochereau 
in the 14th arrondissement of Paris, near the Montparnasse district.

Here, visitors from all over the 
world can descend into the city's dark and dank bowels for a 
whistle-stop tour of a small section of the catacombs.

One visitor told CNN: 
'I think people are fascinated with death. They don't know what it's 
about and you see all these bones stacked up, and the people that have 
come before us, and it's fascinating. We're trying to find our past and 
it's crazy and gruesome and fun all at the same time.'

The well-worn trail might be enough to satisfy the tourists, but other Parisians like to go further - and 
deeper - to explore the network.

The name given to the group of explorers who go into the cave network illegally and unsupervised is Cataphiles.

The top secret groups go deep underground, using hidden entrances all over the city. And they sometimes stay for days at a time, equipped with head lamps and home-made maps.

Street names are etched into the walls to help explorers navigate their way around the underground version of the city and some groups have even been known to throw parties in the tunnels or drink wine.

For catacomb devotees, the silence experienced deep in tunnels cannot be replicated anywhere else.

The network has become a draw for Parisians who want to explore the unchartered territory, who are known as Cataphiles

Urban explorer Loic Antoine-Gambeaud told CNN: 'I think it's in the collective 
imagination. Everybody knows that there is something below Paris; that 
something goes on that's mysterious. But I don't think many people have 
even an idea of what the underground is like.'

Those caught exploring unauthorised 
sections of the network could end up out of pocket. Police tasked with 
patrolling the tunnels have the power to hand out fines of 60 euros to 
anyone caught illegally roaming the network.

A by-product of the early development
 of Paris, the catacombs were subterranean quarries which were 
established as limestone was extracted deep underground to build the 
city above.

However, a number of streets 
collapsed as the quarries weakened parts of the city's foundations. 
Repairs and reinforcements were made and the network went through 
several transformations throughout history.

However it wasn't until the 18th 
century that the catacombs became known as the Empire of the Dead when 
they became the solution to overcrowding in the city's cemeteries.

The number of dead bodies buried in 
Paris's cemeteries and beneath its churches was so great that they began
 breaking through the walls of people's cellars and causing serious 
health concerns.

So the human remains were transferred
 to the underground quarries in the early 1780s. There are now more than
 6million people underground.

The space was the perfect solution to ease overcrowding in cemeteries but it presented disadvantages elsewhere.

It is the reason there are few tall buildings in Paris; large foundations cannot be built because the catacombs are directly under the city's streets.

The tunnels also played their part in the Second World War. Parisian members of the French Resistance used the winding tunnels

And German soldiers also set up an underground bunker in the catacombs, just below the 6th arrondissement.

Much of it is out of bounds, but for some Parisians, the lure of the catacombs is one they cannot resist
