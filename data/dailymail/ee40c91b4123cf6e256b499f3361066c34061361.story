Low gravity could prevent the growth and spread of thyroid cancer cells, scientists claim.

Experimental biologists have studied the spread of the disease using a ‘vomit comet’ – an airplane used to simulate microgravity and train astronauts.

Dutch researchers subjected thyroid cancer cell cultures to 22 seconds of simulated microgravity using a parabolic flight and found that genes and proteins behaved differently.

Dutch scinetists discovered that genes and proteins involved in malignant cell growth, changed in behaviour in microgravity conditions to become less aggressive that they would have been on Earth. A stock picture of magnified cancerous cells from the thyroid are shown

Cells in the human body normally grow within support structures made up of proteins and carbohydrates, which is how organs and tumours maintain their three-dimensional shapes.

In lab settings, however, cells grow flat, spreading out in sheets.

Because they don't duplicate the shapes they normally would make in the body, they don't behave the way they would in the body, either, which poses problems for scientists who study cancer by examining genetic changes affecting cell growth and development.

But in space, cells outside a living organism
 can still form three-dimensional groupings, or aggregates, that 
resemble what they look like inside the body.

Scientists from the Department of Oral Cell Biology, Academic Centre for Dentistry Amsterdam (ACTA), compared the results of the cancer cells to some that had spent 10 days aboard China’s Shenzou 8 spacecraft in 2011.

They discovered that genes and proteins involved in malignant cell growth become less aggressive that they would have been on Earth, PopSci reported.

‘Gravity can lead to changes in cell proliferation, differentiation, signalling, and gene expression,’ they wrote in the study published in in the FASEB (Federation of American Scientists for Experimental Biology) Journal.

‘At first glance, gravitational forces seem too small to affect bodies with the size of a cell. Thus, the initial response to gravity is both puzzling and important for understanding physiological changes in space.

‘This also offers a unique environment to study the mechanical response of cells,’ they added.

While the scientists stopped short of recommending trips into space for cancer sufferers in their study, they think research into how the disease reacts in microgravity environments could unlock secrets of cells’ behaviour and ultimately lead to better treatments.

Thyroid cancer is the 20th most common cancer in the UK, accounting for almost 1 per cent of all new cases, according to Cancer Research UK’s 2010 statistics.

The U.S. National Cancer Institute reported there were 60,220 new cases of thyroid cancer in the U.S. in 2013 and over half-a-million people living with the disease in the country.

Nasa explained that space provides ideal conditions for studying cancer cells, as cells in the human body normally grow within support structures made up of proteins and carbohydrates, which is how organs and tumours maintain their three-dimensional shapes. 

In lab settings however, cells grow flat and spread out in sheets. Because they don't duplicate the shapes they make in the body, they don't behave in the same way either, which poses problems for scientists trying to unlock their secrets.

The aircraft gives its occupants and experiments the effects of weightlessness by following an elliptic flight path relative to the centre of the Earth. The aircraft (pictured) and its contents are in free fall at certain points of its flight path

However, in space, cells outside a living organism can still form three-dimensional groupings that resemble what they look like inside the body and scientists have been studying the effect of gravity on cells in microgravity conditions since the 1970s.

Experiments on the space shuttles and the space station have shown changes in immune cells, including changes in cell-signaling cytokines, (small proteins secreted to mediate immunity and inflammation).

The research indicates that the immune system is suppressed in microgravity.

The architecture of cells changes in microgravity, with changes to cell walls, internal organisation and even their basic shapes.

A series of experiments aboard the International Space Station examined changes to human colon, ovarian and other cancer cells.

In one investigation, reduced production of cytokines in a human Muellerian ovarian tumour cell line were observed.

Understanding changes in production of these proteins could help researchers comprehend the mechanisms of tumour cell development, Nasa’s scientists said.
