A  man thought to have died of Ebola in the middle of a Liberian street was discovered to still be alive when funeral workers arrived to pick up his body.

The unnamed 37-year-old is said to have been dying from the virus in the open air for several days but ambulance workers in the capital Monrovia refused to treat him, local community leaders said.

Finally, following days without medical attention, the man stopped moving and funeral workers were called - although while preparing to take him for burial they noticed he was trying to move his arms.

The realistion that the man was still alive prompted cheers from the large crowd of onlookers, who then had to plead with paramedics to take the man for treatment at the hospital.

'He's alive': A burial team arrived and began spraying the unnamed man - who had been covered by a blanket - with  bleach. As they put hid 'body' on a stretcher, one worker noticed the man was moving his arms

Not dead: Although incredibly weak, the man could clearly be seen moving his arms to indicate he was still alive

Joy: The realistion that the man was still alive prompted cheers from the large crowd of onlookers, who then had to plead with paramedics to take the man for treatment at the hospital

The incident occurred earlier this week in an Ebola-ravaged section of the Liberian capital Monrovia and was captured on video by ABC News.

Thinking the man had already died, reporter Dr Richard Besser was filming a piece to camera, having spoken to several community leaders about the way the victim had been abandoned without medical treatment for several days.

While the item was being recorded, a burial team arrived and began spraying the man - who had been covered by a blanket - with disinfectant and bleach.

Minutes later, as they started lifting him onto a stretcher to be placed in a mortuary vehicle, one of the funeral workers noticed he was still moving and a cry of 'He's alive' rang out.

A large crowd of onlookers then broke into cheers and applause, although the realisation initially had little impact other than the burial team dumping the critically ill man back on the floor and driving off.

An ambulance was called and this time arrived within 10 minutes, with locals pleading with paramedics to ensure the man was transported to a hospital in the hope he could be saved.

Dying: The realisation that the man was still alive initially had little impact other than to convince the burial team to take the critically ill man off their stretcher and dump him back on the street

Reluctant: An ambulance  arrived within 10 minutes, but locals had to plead with paramedics through the vehicle's window to ensure the man was finally transported to a hospital

At last: Ambulance workers eventually put the critically ill man on a stretcher and took him to hospital

Hope: The reason it was difficult to get the dying man the medical care he so desperately needed is due to a chronic shortage of hospital beds for Ebola victims in the virus-ravaged Liberian capital Monrovia

The sick man's current state of health is not known, but Dr Besser said he appeared so ill that it seems unlikely he would have been able to cling on to life for much longer than a few more hours.

He said the reason it had proven so difficult to get him the medical care he so desperately needed is due to a chronic shortage of hospital beds for Ebola victims in virus-ravaged Monrovia.

On the other hand, there is still plenty of space at Liberia's cemeteries and crematoriums, which is why the burial team were more than happy to pick up what they thought was the man's corpse within a hour of him being reported dead. 

The news comes as an American woman was confined to her Dallas apartment under armed guard after a man infected with Ebola stayed at her home

Louise Troh said Thursday that she is tired of being locked up and wants federal health authorities to decontaminate her home, adding that she never imagined this could happen to her so far from disease-ravaged West Africa.

Authorities say the circle of people in the U.S. possibly exposed to Ebola widened after the man - who arrived from Liberia last month - was discharged from hospital without being tested for the virus.

An American cameraman helping to cover the Ebola outbreak in Liberia for NBC News has tested positive for the virus and will be flown back to the United States for treatment.

NBC News President Deborah Turness said Thursday the rest of the NBC News crew including medical correspondent Dr. Nancy Snyderman will be flown back to the U.S. and placed in quarantine for 21 days 'in an abundance of caution.'

The freelance cameraman has been working in Liberia for three years for Vice News and other media outlets, and has been covering the Ebola epidemic. He began shooting for NBC on Tuesday. The network is withholding his name at his family's request.

He began feeling tired and achy Wednesday and discovered he had a slight fever. He went to a treatment center Thursday to be tested, and is being kept there, said Snyderman, who was interviewed Thursday night on 'The Rachel Maddow Show' on MSNBC.

Snyderman said she believes his exposure to the virus happened sometime before he started working with the NBC crew, since it is usually eight to 10 days before the first symptoms are seen.
