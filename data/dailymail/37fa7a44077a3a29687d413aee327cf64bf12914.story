Apple is in talks with US cable firms about streaming live TV to its upcoming TV set, it has been claimed.

However, mystery still surrounds the firm's much rumoured plans to built its own TV.

According to the Wall Street Journal, Apple has not yet reached a deal with American cable companies.

Apple already makes a £99 TV box, but the firm is believed to be developing a far more advanced version, as well as its own line of TV sets.

The box delivers films, music and television shows from iTunes to a TV set and also lets iPhone, iPad and iPod touch stream content from their device to a TV.

Apple also produced an app for iPhones and iPads letting owners control the device from their gadget.

A full Apple TV is expected to improve on this functionality, allowing users to see information about programmes they are watching and to change channels.

Speculation about an Apple television has been rife since the publication of Steve Jobs biography last year.

It is believed Steve Jobs worked on the Apple TV project before his death. He told his biographer that firm had 'cracked' a way to make TVs easier to use.

The Apple co-founder, who died in October 2011, told his biographer, Walter Isaacson, that he had 'cracked' the problem of television, although Isaacson did not reveal the plans as the product has not been launched.

Late last year, 'industry sources' were quoted as saying that Apple would launch 32-inch and 37-inch television sets some time this year.

'Two people briefed on the matter said the technology involved could ultimately be embedded in a television,' the WSJ said.

'Apple has worked on prototypes for televisions in the past, according to people briefed on the projects.'

The rumours comes as Sky yesterday unveiled its remote control iPad app letting users control their Sky+ box from an iPad.
