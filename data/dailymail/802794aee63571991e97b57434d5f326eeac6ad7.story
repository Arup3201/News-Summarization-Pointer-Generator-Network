'The claim filed today will be thoroughly investigated by the City's Risk Management Department, as are all claims filed against the city,' the statement said.'The incident documented in this claim involves an unfortunate and highly unusual event. 'The City maintains thousands and thousands of trees both along City streets and throughout its large network of parks and open space areas. 'Both City staff and outside contractors are assigned to address any issues regarding health, safety and emergencies related to City trees. 'The current claim is a serious matter that the City will address it with all due diligence. 'We remain confident that this unfortunate incident is an isolated and highly unusual event and does not reflect any broader condition for City trees.
