An injured Professor Green is being looked after by his fiancée MillIe Mackintosh after being hit by a car.

The London rapper, real name Stephen Manderson,  who posted two photos of his Instagram page receiving medical attention on the roadside on Friday night, was being taken care of by his reality star wife-to-be.

Although 29-year-old initially tried to see the funny side as he carried on using social media just after the smash, his situation soon turned 'real' after he was told he may need surgery.

Recovering: Millie shared this picture of a shirtless Professor Green as she took over caring for her husband-to-be

Millie posted an intimate picture on Twitter on Saturday evening showing a shirtless Professor Green in the arms of his caring girlfriend, with the caption: 'Thank you for all the lovely messages, teddy Edward and I are on the night shift.'

It comes after the rapper tweeted a picture of his swollen leg in hospital leaving the musician admitting he was feeling 'f**king depressed'.

Although he later saw the funny side by sharing a snap of a bell given to him by his nan saying Millie would be getting the brunt of his convalescence.

He tweeted around midnight: 'Won't know until tomorrow if its surgery or not, so f****** depressed.

'No jokes left in me this could hinder and ruin so so much.

'If I'd have fallen when the car hit me I'd be dead... Would have been my head in between the cars.

'Nearly 4 yrs to the day I got stabbed and again a full moon, something about this time of year that brings me badness.'

And breathe: Professor Green in the ambulance with three paramedics

Earlier, he had explained the 
incident took place when he was crossing a road and ended up 'crushed 
between two Mercedes Benz vehicles.

Soon
after the accident, Prof Green uploaded an Instagram image of him lying
on the road breathing on Nitrous oxide and oxygen, with an umbrella 
sheltering his head from the rain.

An image uploaded a short time later 
showed the rapper still using the gas as he lay in the ambulance while 
he was surrounded by three female paramedics.

He tweeted: 'Not ideal. Someone run me over. Sorry hartpury. #notanelaborateexcuse.

'Off to the hospital we go. I'm making jokes but I'm in all sorts of discomfort... Probable broken leg...

'Crushed between a @mercedesbenzuk ML63 and an SLS AMG #classy.

'As much as I love AMG's this would have been a lot less Sever if that engine wasn't so powerful.

'I know how all the gassed MC's feel now.'

Disappointment: Professor Green was due to appear at Hartpury College Summer Ball

Just
half an hour earlier, he had complained about bad traffic as he rushed 
to Hartpury College in Gloucs, where he was scheduled to make a personal
appearance at their summer ball.

He had written around 6pm: 'Traffic is making this evening VERY difficult.'

Once in hospital, his fiancee Millie Mackintosh later updated his worried fans with his condition.

She tweeted around 10pm: 'Think im going to have to get a nurse outfit and a bell... #dotingwifey.

'Waiting while he's having an X-ray.. Everything is crossed!'

If Professor Green does need surgery, it could affect his busy summer tour schedule and his upcoming September wedding to Millie.

A statement on Hartpury College's Twitter feed confirmed Professor Green's appearance at the ball had been cancelled.

It read: 'Sorry to confirm Professor Green can't be at Summer Ball tonight after car accident. Working on replacement act. Confirm details shortly.'

They fortunately managed to find a last-minute replacement in rapper Wretch 32, to the delight of the hundreds of students attending the ball.

Wretch 32 tweeted: 'Hartpury summer ball see you soon!!! Ah yeaaaa!!!'

Prof Green had returned to England earlier on Friday after flying in from Marbella following his gig at the Tibu club.

MailOnline have contacted Professor Green's representative for comment.
