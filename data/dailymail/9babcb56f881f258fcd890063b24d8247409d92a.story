A father has miraculously survived after he was hit on the head by a speeding train as he leaned over the edge of a platform to vomit.

Stephen Wright's two terrified sons watched as their father's skull was struck with the commuter train, though to be reaching speeds of up to 70mph.

Warehouse clerk Stephen was hit after he began to feel unwell while waiting on the platform in Goodmayes, near Ilford, Essex.

But against all the odds the 34-year-old father escaped the accident with just shock, whiplash and swelling.

The packed commuter train, which was not scheduled to stop at the station, is thought to have been reaching speeds of up to 70mph.

Stephen managed to board another train with his two sons Kye, seven, and Keon, five, and went home after the incident.

But baffled police did not realise he had staggered away from the scene and searched the tracks for his body after the alarm was raised.

Mr Wright, of Upton Park, east London, said: 'My aunt said that God was rolling with me, and she's right.

'There's no way I should be here.'

The accident happened after Stephen 
picked up his two sons from Barley Lane Primary School in Chadwell Heath
last Wednesday night.

He went into the station in Goodmayes Road at about 6.30pm and began to feel unwell.

He stepped to the edge of the platform to be sick on the tracks and was standing on the yellow line leaning over when the train smashed into him.

'The next thing I knew I felt the biggest bang in my head and I screamed out and grabbed my head,' he recalled with horror.

'I thought I could fall down.

'My son was so scared and I had to be strong.'

Deeply shocked and bleeding from his mouth, Stephen managed to stagger across the platform with his sons and board a waiting train to Stratford.

He was having tea at his girlfriend's 
house in Manor Park as he recovered from his ordeal when a train 
accident was reported and the line was closed for two hours that night.

Stephen went to King George Hospital, Goodmayes, the next day after he 
suffered swelling to his head and neck as well as whiplash.

He underwent two brain scans at Romford's Queen's Hospital but was given the all-clear.

Stephen said it struck home just how lucky he had been to survive after he was tracked down by a police officer involved in the station search for his body after the dramatic scare.

'A policeman told me, 'we were searching for you on the tracks last night'.

'That's when it came to me more and started to sink in,' he said.

This is not the first time Stephen has had a brush with death - when he was a baby he plunged 50ft out of his flat.

He plummeted five storeys out of a tower block in Hackney, east London, when he was a 15-month-old infant and survived without any broken bones or hardly a scratch.

'Nobody could believe how I'd got out of my cot but I did.

'I fell on the hard concrete - I should have been dead,' he said.

A British Transport Police spokesman said: ''BTP officers were called to the line close to Goodmayes rail station on Wednesday, 21 November after a driver reported striking a person on one of the platforms.

'BTP and Essex Police officers attended the incident, which was reported to BTP at 7pm.

'A thorough search of the area was carried out by officers, but no person was found.

'A man in his thirties has since come forward to police reporting he was struck by a train at the station.

'Officers have spoken to the man, who voluntarily attended Goodmayes hospital following the incident, which appears to have been an accident.

'The man sustained minor injuries and has since been discharged from hospital.'
