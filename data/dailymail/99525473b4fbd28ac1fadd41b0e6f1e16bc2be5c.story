This is the £6.7milllion home that Rory McIlroy hopes will suit him down to a tee.

The world number one golfer, who earned more than £8million in winnings alone this year, is said to have closed a deal on the sprawling 10,000 sq ft Florida mansion.

And it is expected the luxury home, which is only a few par fives away from rival and world number three Tiger Woods, will become the new love nest for McIlroy and his tennis star girlfriend Caroline Wozniacki.

The County Down golfer’s stellar career means he is spending an increasing amount of time in the US in between travelling around the world for tournaments.

It is understood that McIlory has paid ‘close’ to the $10.9million asking price for the luxurious property.

Built in 2012, the six-bedroom house in Palm Beach Gardens includes a gym, swimming pool, and its own private jetty.

The golfer will also be able to work on his game, as the home, which is surrounded by palm trees, includes a putting green.

Bear Club Golf Course and a kilometre away from Woods’s home

McIlroy
 recently put his home in County Down, which he shared with ex- 
girlfriend Holly Sweeney, up for sale for more than £2million.

He is said to have thought about selling for a while and said that the decision was made for ‘practical and commercial reasons’.

He
 told the Telegraph: I have really enjoyed living here. It is a really 
special place which has allowed me to relax and unwind - when I get 
time.'

His new luxury home boasts six bedrooms and nine bathrooms, as well as a gym, swimming pool and its own private jetty.

It is thought it will be a base for him and his Wozniacki.

The pair, who have been dating since July last year, were recently seen together skiing in Aspen.

They posted a photo on Twitter before they took to the slopes while Rory tweeted a message to his girlfriend.

‘I’m gonna get you like Harry got Mary Swanson in Dumb and Dumber! #Aspen #snowballintheface,’ he wrote online.
