The father of 17 accused of killing six of his children in a house fire once ordered his toddler son to punch his mother in the face because she dared to stand up to him, a court heard yesterday.

Heather Kehoe, 33, told a jury how Michael Philpott took her virginity when she was just 15, then subjected her to years of physical and mental abuse.

The pair ran away together a fortnight after her 16th birthday, when his first wife walked in on them having sex.

Within six months, the teenager was pregnant with the first of two sons she bore him during a violent relationship which culminated in Philpott ordering their son Mikey to punch her.

Miss Kehoe told how she was trying to get her son ready for bed but the ‘dominant’ Philpott ordered her to put him down. When she replied, ‘He’s my son too’, Philpott began manhandling her towards the back garden – where he would occasionally send her as a ‘punishment’.

When she again tried to resist, she said Philpott ordered Mikey to ‘punch me in the face and kick me’.

Struggling to contain her emotion, she said the boy, then aged two or three, carried out his father’s orders.

Yesterday, she said that testifying against Philpott was ‘not about revenge’ but ‘about people needing to know what sort of a person he is.’ 

Nottingham Crown Court heard how she first met Philpott at a lake near her school which she used to frequent with her friends and where he would go fishing. She was 14 and he 37.

She said ‘intimacy had been slowly building’ between them for almost a year when they slept together for the first time.

Then, soon after the pair eloped in 1996 – and she was disowned by her parents – Philpott made her pregnant and quickly secured the three-bedroom Derby council house he is now accused of setting ablaze.

The court heard that after parting from Miss Kehoe, Philpott went on to enjoy a ‘three-way relationship’ at the property with the woman who would become his  second wife and a mistress, Lisa Willis, 29. 

Philpott, 56, his wife Mairead, 31, and his ‘best friend’ Paul Mosley, 45, are all accused of manslaughter on the basis that they set fire to the house to frame Miss Willis, who had walked out on Philpott with her five children three months previously.

Philpott's first wife was Pamela Lomax, with whom he had three children; two sons and a daughter all aged in their twenties.

Their marriage came to an end when he began an affair with a teenage Heather Kehoe in 1995. She went on to have two sons with him, now aged in their early teens.

Philpott went on to have an unconventional relationship with his second wife, Mairead, and his mistress, Lisa Willis, with all three sharing a home. Miss Willis, 29, was even a bridesmaid for Mick and Mairead at the couple’s 2003 wedding.

Philpott was father to Mairead’s daughter Jade, and sons, John, Jack, Jessie and Jayden. Duwayne, Mairead’s son from a previous relationship, also lived with the pair. All six of the children died after the house fire last May.

He had three daughters and a son with Miss Willis, who had another child from a previous relationship - also raised as Philpott's.

The 56-year-old is understood to have another son, aged five, who he once described as being the product of a liaison with the partner of a friend.

Hours after the fatal blaze last May, Philpott and Miss Willis had been due to face each other in a court custody hearing to decide their children’s place of residence.

Miss Kehoe, of Rainworth, Nottinghamshire, wept as she outlined the treatment she received at the hands of her ‘Jekyll and Hyde’ lover, who she said was a ‘good father’ in public but not behind closed doors.

She said Philpott could be caring but ‘everything had to be his way’ or he would ‘lash out and be violent’.

The court heard how he emptied her childhood savings account of £1,500 and harvested all the money she made from a full-time airport cleaning job.

And she said Philpott sent her back to work between a month and three months after the births of their two children Mikey, now 15, and Aiden, 14.

Miss Kehoe said Philpott joked of wanting 11 children – enough for a football team.

She said that when she secretly started using contraception to scupper his hopes for more children, her ‘life got worse’ because Philpott became frustrated.

The court heard the relationship ended in 2000 when Miss Kehoe fled to a police station after being thrown out of the house by Philpott during a violent row.

During cross-examination by Philpott’s barrister, Anthony Orchard QC, she denied her day in court was an ‘opportunity to vent her anger’ at her former lover.

The Philpotts and forklift truck driver Mosley, all of Derby, each deny the manslaughter of the Philpotts’ children Duwayne, 13, Jade, ten, John, nine, Jack, eight, Jesse, six, and Jayden, five.

The trial continues.
