Newcastle United manager Alan Pardew says £1.5million bargain-buy striker Ayoze Perez has more natural technical ability than his former players Carlos Tevez, Teddy Sheringham and Dean Ashton.

Perez, 21, has already scored four goals in his debut season in England after signing from Spanish Second Division club Tenerife.

The Spaniard is expected to lead the line against Everton on Sunday after catching the eye of Sir Alex Ferguson against Manchester United on Boxing Day, and Pardew, who had some great attacking talent at his disposal at West Ham, predicts a glittering future for the Spaniard.

‘He has surprised me at how good he has been. He is a real talent,’ said Pardew.

‘I have been fortunate to work with some really good strikers. I think of Tevez, Sheringham, Dean Ashton, and he has got faster feet than all three of them.

‘And the work ethic he has put in for the team as well, if he progresses like he is, we don’t know where he’ll end up.

‘I was lucky enough to have a quick glass of wine with Sir Alex [on Boxing Day] and he caught his eye.’

The comparison with Tevez is a real boost to Perez given that the Argentine forward has played for some of the biggest clubs in Europe including Manchester United, Manchester City and Juventus, and scored for his country at the World Cup.

Barcelona and Real Madrid had been interested in signing the Spain Under-21 forward before Newcastle moved to bring him to Tyneside last June.

And Pardew reflected: ‘He won player of the year last season in the Spanish Second Division, so it’s not a complete mystery.

‘But we worked hard on his signature and worked hard on his family to give him the platform that we would give him an opportunity.

‘We put a lot of physical work into him. It’s not bulk he needs, because agility is a massive part of his game, it’s just body strength and he has that,’ said Pardew.

Pardew is also cheered by the emergence of Newcastle’s academy players Paul Dummett, Rolando Aarons and Adam Armstrong, the 17-year-old who started his first top-flight match on Boxing Day.

The Newcastle boss added: ‘I genuinely think that with Dummett, Aarons, Armstrong and Perez, we have four really outstanding young players and that is very, very difficult to get through at a Premier League club.’
