A woman who says her huge 38KK breasts are ruining her life is outraged after being denied surgery to reduce them on the NHS.

Kim Mills, 32, has been refused the operation even though she claims her enormous chest has caused arthritis of the spine.

The mother-of-two has even lost 4st in a bid to shrink her chest - but it failed to help.

Ms Mills has applied for funding to have her breasts reduced on the NHS but her request was refused

However, 
her local Clinical Commissioning Group in Essex has denied her request to have her breasts reduced her to a D cup because her circumstances are ‘not exceptional’.

Ms Mills says she is unable to afford to have the surgery carried out privately.

She now 
hopes that Jeremy Hunt’s call yesterday to stop cosmetic procedures 
being carried out on the NHS will free up money for surgery like hers.

Yesterday,
 Mr Hunt said the taxpayer should not be funding cosmetic surgery and 
that there should be a clampdown on NHS spending on it.

Ms Mills, a resource planning analyst, said: ‘People may think it's not a serious health issue but they don't have to live with it.

‘My breasts are so heavy and I'm only 5ft 8in. It affects everything from cleaning to struggling to brush my four-year-old daughter's hair.

‘If I attempt to go for a run I'm left in agony, it's horrendous. The NHS are happy to shell out boob jobs for vanity reasons but I just want a reduction so I can live normally.’

Ms Mills, from Chelmsford, Essex, was wearing a 38DD by the age of 13 and had was a KK by her early 20s.

While her friends longed for bigger breasts, the mother-of-two hated her chest and the unwanted attention it attracted from men.

On nights out men would make lewd comments about her chest, despite Ms Mills always making sure her big bust was covered.

With her self-esteem at a low point, she turned to comfort eating and by 2010 had ballooned to 19st 8Ibs.

Yesterday the Health Secretary said cosmetic surgery should not be paid for by the tax payer.

He said there should be a clampdown on NHS spending and that he could understand public anger at high profile cases of breast enlargements and dental work being offered by the NHS.

Mr Hunt insisted all decisions must be taken on ‘clinical need’ and public money must not be used to pay for surgery just to improve someone's looks.

He said: ‘We should not be doing cosmetic work on the NHS.

'The decisions are taken on the basis of clinical need, but I have made it very clear that I am against purely cosmetic work being done.

‘There will be times when there is a mental health need, which the local doctor has said is very serious.

‘But I do completely understand people’s reservations about some of the things that happen.’

Despite this, her weight did not affect her bust size and she stayed a massive 38KK.

‘I
 hated my boobs so much I comfort ate,’ she said. ‘I would snack on 
chocolate and sweets when I was feeling low, and soon my waistline 
started to grow but my boobs didn't.

‘At my biggest weight I felt so depressed that I decided to lose weight in an attempt to shed some pounds from my boobs as well. But it was to no avail.’

Now her 4st weight loss has failed to help, she says her situation is becoming desperate.

Last month she was diagnosed with arthritis of the spine and believes her breasts are to blame.

She claims the fear of showing a man her large chest has also prevented her from having a relationship for the past three years.

Ms Mills said: ‘Mr Hunt's comments really ring true for me. The use of NHS funds for glamour and vanity reasons is disgraceful.

‘It seems wrong that I should be denied a breast reduction on the NHS when it is seriously affecting my health.

‘If the government stop the funding for cosmetic procedures then that might leave enough funding to help people who need the operations for medical reasons.’

The single mother, who lives with daughters, Alana, 14, and Alyssa-Mae, four, added that the condition is affecting her mental health.

She said: ‘People see me as a confident girl, but it is far from the truth. I have no self-esteem because my chest has ruined my life.

‘I've lost all my confidence and haven't been seen naked by a man for three years.

Ms Mills is angry that other women have been given boob jobs on the NHS for cosmetic reasons

‘The thought of showing a man my chest horrifies me because they're so heavy and saggy. Wherever I go men make lewd comments at me, it's embarrassing.

‘Women are always getting boobs jobs and nose jobs on the NHS, it seems unfair I can't get a breast reduction when it isn't just for cosmetic reasons but for my health.

‘Girls out there are getting nose jobs and boobs jobs on the NHS, going up from As to DDs. So it seems unfair I can't get a breast reduction.

‘I have never been on benefits in my life, and I'm a single working mum so I can't afford to pay for the surgery privately.

‘I can't get involved with my children when they are playing, and I look ridiculous.

‘Where ever I go people stare at my chest or make lewd comments. I hate it and the NHS won't do anything.’

Last year, NHS surgeons carried out 790 breast implant operations costing the taxpayer approximately £3.5 million.

A spokesperson for Mid Essex Clinical Commissioning Group said: 'New evidence has been submitted regarding this case and it is due to be considered again in early July so we cannot comment any further. Mid Essex CCG do not fund cosmetic surgery.'
