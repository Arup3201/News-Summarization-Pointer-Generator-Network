Cristiano Ronaldo has had every reason to celebrate on the field after a stunning start to the season for Real Madrid.

And the superstar has been doing the same off the field as he celebrated the one-year anniversary since his underwear brand CR7 launched on Sunday.

The 29-year-old, who scored the opener in his side's 4-0 win at Granada on Saturday, was pictured celebrating the anniversary by cutting a cake in the shape of his briefs.

Since it's launch last November, the CR7 brand has gone from strength to strength, with a Halloween collection recently released.

Ronaldo has started this season in unsurprisingly lethal form, already scoring 23 goals in all competitions.

The former Manchester United forward will be hoping to heap more misery on Liverpool when they meet in the Champions League for the second time in a fortnight on Tuesday, after scoring the opener in the convincing 3-0 win over the Merseysiders at Anfield.
