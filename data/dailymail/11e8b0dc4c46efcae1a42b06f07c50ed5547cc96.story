A man who murdered his fiancée with a single punch during an argument over whether to take a bus or a taxi home was jailed for life today.

Former soldier Ryan Ingham, 26, sent Caroline Finegan, 29, crumpling to the ground like a ‘bag of potatoes’ after he ran at her at full pelt before striking her in the face.

One witness was ‘moved to tears’ after seeing Ingham hit her ‘like a car travelling at 40mph’ before he started to shake her ‘like a rag doll’ as she lay on the ground in an act of ‘wanton thuggery’.

Killer: Ryan Ingham, 26, has been convicted of murdering his fiancee, Caroline Finegan, 29

The force 
of the punch broke Miss Finegan’s nose, her eye socket and swivelled her
 head so violently that it tore blood vessels in her neck.

During
 a 999 call as bingo hall worker Miss Finegan lay dying, Ingham was 
heard telling her: ‘Hello, wakey wakey. Oi, monkey get up, look you 
bashed your head. What you doing, your belly is showing.’

When
 paramedics arrived at the scene near Shudehill bus station in 
Manchester city centre at around 1am on January 16, Miss Finegan was not
 breathing. She was pronounced dead later that day in hospital.

Scene: The couple had been on a night out in Manchester city centre before they rowed, the court heard

Today
 at Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester Ingham who was convicted of 
murder after a trial showed no emotion as he was ordered to serve a 
minimum 16 years before he could be considered for parole. It emerged he
 had a string of previous convictions for assaults on ex-girlfriends.

Judge
 Peter Lakin told him: ‘You are an unpleasant coward and young man with a
 complete inability to control your temper particularly after the 
consumption of alcohol. You have in any view a very disturbing history 
for assaulting your partners and clearly you have no respect what so 
ever for the welfare of those who trust you in a relationship.

‘You
 repaid Caroline’s love for you with a violent punch to her face which 
caused immediate fatal brain haemorrhage. The reason you did this was 
only because of a trivial argument over how to get home. With that 
single punch you took away Caroline’s life.

Tattooed thug: Father-of-six Ryan Ingham has a history of abuse towards his girlfriends and finally murdered one of them. He was sentenced to life imprisonment today with a recommendation he serve 16 years

‘She
 was only 29 and had her whole life ahead of her. She clearly thought 
her relationship with you would bring future happiness. Sadly for her 
she was completely wrong. You are a dangerous young man particularly 
toward those in a relationship with you.’

Earlier
 the court heard how Miss Finnegan who had five children from previous 
relationships had met father-of-six Ingham in August last year and the 
couple become engaged three months later.

The incident took place in January after they had out together at Churchills pub in Manchester city centre.

CCTV
 captured the pair as they appeared to be arguing after leaving the pub 
to make their way home to Stockport. The couple were seen initially 
heading towards a bus station before speaking separately to a taxi 
driver.

Witness
 Anthony O’Connor, a worker at Manchester Cathedral who had just left 
work after a shift, said: ‘I saw a lady shouting very loudly and it 
seemed directed at me and she was probably 40ft away. Then I noticed a 
gentleman run straight past me on my left side. He was in the middle of 
the road. He was running extremely fast.

A witness reported seeing Ingham drag Miss Finegan by the arms onto the pavement after punching her

‘He ran at her at a really full speed and then came into contact with her and with the punch she completely fell to the ground.

‘The
 one thing that affects me that time and to this day is the way she fell
 to the ground. The only way I can describe it is if you had a bag of 
potatoes and if you drop them and they crumple. That is how she fell. As
 far as I am aware the life left her instantly. She completely collapsed
 into the road. He did not stop running and ran four or five steps 
after.

‘I
 could not see where the punch landed. I knew it was the upper part of 
the body. He punched her while he was running. He ran, kept on running 
and punched her. It was like someone hitting her in a motor car at about
 40mph. It was with incredible force he hit her with. He picked up great
 speed. She was then on the floor.

‘He
 came back and immediately picked her up by the arms and that scene was 
horrific and it disturbed me. He dragged her onto the pavement and as he
 was dragging her, her blouse was pulled up and her skirt was coming 
down.

‘I
 said to myself ‘What a way for a human being to go.’ There was total 
disrespect for human life. It was horrendous. He started to shake her 
like a rag doll.

‘I
 think it was a total attack of thuggery. He had no respect of human 
life and not respect for that girl. It was wanton thuggery. There is no 
excuse for it.’

When
 Ingham rang 999 he claimed he was qualified to carry out first aid on 
the battlefield. When asked by the operator what caused the fall he 
said: ‘I don’t know because we were arguing.

‘I
 ran over to her and next thing I know she was being a mong, lying on 
the floor, because we were about to get a taxi home. We were arguing 
about getting a taxi home. It is superficial. I am ex-Army. I have got 
my battlefield first aid.’

Ryan Ingham who spent six months in the Army has been in court a dozen times before for 23 offences, most linked to domestic violence. Here are the lowlights.

2005: Criminal assault - during course of argument with his 17-year-old girlfriend, he punched her in the face and body causing minor injury.

August 2005: Same victim. Ingham elbowed her in the head during a domestic argument and received a suspended sentence.

August 2008: Assaulted mother and father.

2012: Threatened girlfriend at the time with a knife to the neck and threatened her unborn child.

October  2012: Before he became engaged to Caroline Finegan, there was incident where he hit her and she sustained a swollen cheek.

‘She
 is in no danger. She is just p****d. I do not know if she is faking it 
or not. She is all right because she is breathing normal. She is asleep.
 She is snoring. That is how I know she is asleep.’CT scans later 
revealed extensive subarachnoid bleeding in Miss Finegan’s brain. At 
6.19pm on January 16 she was pronounced dead.

Ingham
 initially said she had passed out and fell over but later admitted they
 had been ‘bickering’ about whether to get a bus or taxi home. He denied
 murder.

Senior
 Investigating Officer Duncan Thorpe from Greater Manchester Police 
(GMP) said after the case: ‘Caroline’s family have been left deeply 
upset and cannot believe someone who claimed to love her could kill her.
 Ingham himself will have to live with the fact his reckless and 
thoughtless action took the life of an innocent woman.

‘GMP
 takes all reports of domestic abuse seriously. If you’re a friend, 
family member or neighbour who witnesses signs of domestic abuse, report
 it to the police.

‘Domestic
 abuse is not acceptable under any circumstances and there are support 
services available for victims and families from the report to 
conviction.’

Sacha
 Cooper, Senior Crown Prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service North
 West, said: ‘Ryan Ingham carried out a horrific unprovoked attack on 
his partner in the centre of Manchester after they had enjoyed a night 
out together.

‘He
 refused to take responsibility for his actions. Initially he fabricated
 a version of events whereby she had fallen to the floor in a drunken 
state and later on offered a plea to manslaughter. However, following a 
trial, the jury convicted him of murder.

‘Today Ryan Ingham will face up to the consequences of his mindless actions as he begins his prison sentence.’
