Fighting back: Deselected Tim Yeo was criticised for earning £400,000 in green energy interests

Tory Tim Yeo’s hopes of avoiding the sack as an MP suffered a setback last night after three fellow grandees piled the pressure on him.

Mr Yeo has been criticised for earning £400,000 from green energy interests since 2009 while chairing the Commons Energy and Climate Change Select Committee since 2010.

Now three fellow Tory MPs – who also chair Commons select committees – have distanced themselves from Mr Yeo, fighting to overturn a decision by local party chiefs to deselect him as Suffolk South MP.

Mr Yeo’s neighbouring North Essex MP, Bernard Jenkin, has backed moves to force MPs to give up all commercial interests linked to committee work.

And he refuses to add his name to MPs calling on Mr Yeo’s activists to save him in a ballot on his future.

And Tory MP James Arbuthnot said he is stepping down as Commons Defence Select Committee head to pursue outside interests in defence as staying on as chairman would be ‘wrong and a conflict of interests’.

Tory John Whittingdale, who leads the Culture, Media And Sport Committee, has indicated he is unwilling to back Mr Yeo and believes Commons committee chairmen should not have ‘substantial earnings’ linked to their political duties.

Mr Yeo, who will be 70 at the next Election, was deselected over claims he spends too little time in his constituency and abused his position as chairman of his Commons committee.

The result of a ballot of 600 local activists on whether to overturn the decision will be announced on February 3.

A report looking into select committee chairman 'affected his reputation'

Mr Jenkin said: ‘Committee chairman who 
scrutinise Whitehall departments and evaluate policies should not have 
outside interests directly connected to those matters.

'That is one of the reasons I have no such outside interests. Parliament’s rules must be more sensitive to avoid conflicts of interest.’

The first steps towards a crackdown on committee chairmen such as Mr Yeo cashing in on outside interests linked to their political roles came in a report by the Commons Standards Committee last week.

Set back: Fellow MPs including John Whittingdale have indicated they are unwilling to back Mr Yeo

It referred to comments about Mr Yeo by Parliamentary Standards Commissioner Kathryn Hudson, who led last year’s inquiry into his conduct. 

She said he had not broken any rules but the affair had ‘affected his reputation’.

She expressed ‘concerns about the external perception of the relationship between an MP’s outside employment and interests and his work for the Commons’.

She was backing an initiative by Speaker John Bercow who said there was ‘an inherent incompatibility between chairing a select committee and having commercial interests in the sector covered by that committee’.

South Suffolk Tory executive member Simon Barrett said: ‘Many people will agree wholeheartedly with these three senior Conservatives. Dissatisfaction with Mr Yeo has grown over a long time. People are tired of his arrogant attitude.’

Mr Yeo insists he was ‘totally exonerated’ by the report into claims he abused his job running the Climate Change Committee.

David Cameron yesterday added his name to Tory MPs backing Mr Yeo, who said last night he would abide by any changes in the rules for committee chairman approved by the Commons, though had no plans to give up his ‘green’ interests until then. 

He said: ‘In more than 30 years as an MP I have always abided by the rules of the House.’
