Vocal apartheid critic: Swedish Prime Minister Olaf Palme, who was gunned down in a central Stockholm street as walked along with his wife

The records of the Swedish author of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo have added a new twist to his country's greatest unsolved murder mystery.

It has emerged that Stieg Larsson sent police 15 boxes of papers he believed linked Prime Minister Olaf Palme's murder to his opposition to the racist apartheid regime in South Africa.

The novelist believed that the huge tranche of documents linked Palme's death to a Swedish former military officer allegedly connected with South African security services.

Books by Larsson, who died of a heart attack in 2004, have sold more than 75million copies in 50 countries.

The latest report has made headlines across Sweden, where, just like the Kennedy assassination, Palme's killing has spawned a legion of conspiracy theories.

Palme was gunned down as he walked along a street in central Stockholm late on February 28, 1986, after going to the cinema with his wife.

A petty criminal was found guilty of the killing in 1989, but was freed on appeal that same year - an outcome that led to widespread criticism of the police for bungling the investigation.

The man Larsson suspected of being the assassin, Swedish secret service agent Bertil Wedin, denied the accusation.

'I have nothing to lose from the truth being established since I am luckily not the murderer,' he told Sweden's Svenska Dagbladet newspaper, which broke the story today.

Deputy Prosecutor-General Kerstin Skarp, who leads the continuing police inquiry into the killing, told the newspaper that Wedin 'is not someone that we are pursuing with any intensity at the moment'.

Wedin's name is not new to the investigation and emerged previously in the Nineties amid intense media speculation that there was a South African connection to the murder.

The killing spawned legions of private investigations, including Larsson's. There were so many probes by ordinary Swedes that a name was even coined for them - 'privatspanare', or private scouts.

Some claimed to have cracked the case with theories ranging from his death being a carefully enacted suicide to the work of foreign spy agencies.

Private investigators have pointed the finger at an array of suspects, from Sweden's own security services to Kurdish separatists and the South African and Yugoslav secret police.

Palme, Social Democrat prime minister between 1969 and 1976 and again between 1982 and 1986, was hated by conservatives at home and abroad for his anti-colonial views and criticism of the U.S.

Some even accused him of being a spy for the KGB.

'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo', the
 first in Larsson's 'The Millennium Trilogy', was made into a Hollywood 
film with Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara in 2011.

Its two sequels 'The Girl Who Played with Fire' and 'The Girl Who Kicked The Hornets' Nest', were also global bestsellers
