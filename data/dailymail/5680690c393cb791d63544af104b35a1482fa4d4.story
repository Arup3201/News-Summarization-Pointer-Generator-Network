Sticky situation: Bradley Herbert Hardison has been charged with breaking and entering, but a day earlier, we won first prize at a doughnut eating competition

There's no way to sugar coat this story!

A North Carolina man who won first prize in an eating competition against some police officers, found himself with a glazed look of his own when they arrested him a day after his victorious binge.

The Camden County Sheriff's Office had been looking for 24-year-old Bradley Herbert Hardison of Elizabeth City in connection with two break-ins.

For nearly nine months, he was a man on the run.

Authorities finally caught up with Hardison and arrested him on Wednesday, just hours after he won the adult division of a doughnut-eating contest at the Elizabeth City Police Department's National Night Out Against Crime.

The event, as the event suggests, was packed with police.

Hardison ate eight doughnuts in two minutes, beating a group that included local police officers and firefighters.

The day after the police-sponsored event, his triumph went stale.

Hardison’s win caught the attention of a local newspaper, along with the attention of Lt. Robeson and less than 24 hours after swallowing his last crumb, The Camden County Sheriff's Office caught up with him after months of investigation and arrested him.

Victory went stale: Hardison devoured eight glazed doughnuts in two 
minutes at the eating competition, but he was a arrested just a day 
later.

Enjoying the moment: 24-year-old Bradley Herbert Hardison's swwet taste of victory was short lived because he was arrested less than 24-hours later after police realized he was a wanted felon

Hardison was jailed under a $2,000 secured bond on two counts of felony breaking and entering and misdemeanor injury to real property.

'I
 did congratulate him,' says Lt. Max Robeson, a deputy with the Camden 
County Sheriff’s Office. 'Good for him. He can eat a lot of doughnuts. 
Good for him.'

'When
 I came in that morning and read that article I was pissed because it’s 
like throwing it in our face,' he says. 'We’ve been looking for you for 
months. I didn’t ask him if he won a trophy – he probably did.'

In November, investigators say Hardison broke into several grocery stores and he is accused of stealing $5,000 in cash.

'It’s like he had the audacity to do something like that knowing that he had broken into these places,' Robeson says.
