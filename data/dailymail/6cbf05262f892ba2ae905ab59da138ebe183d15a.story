Jailed: Mohammed Prince Islam, 26, and a 16-year-old accomplice were captured on film as they used a crowbar to break in to the house in Southampton

Peering menacingly through the french doors, this is hooded burglar Mohammed Prince Islam preparing to break into a house.

Seconds later he and a young accomplice used a crowbar to smash the glass and sneak inside.

Then they helped themselves to householder Mark Avery’s Playstation, games and other goods worth a total of £800.

The pair thought they were in the clear because they had spotted and disabled a security camera outside the three-bedroom house Mr Avery shares with his mother in Southampton.

But unknown to them, 42-year-old Mr Avery had switched on his computer’s webcam before he and his mother left for work that morning, and the whole break-in was clearly captured.

Mr Avery said: ‘As I was leaving I decided to switch it on. I don’t know what made me do it, I just had a bad feeling.

‘And I’m glad I did, it cost only about £40 but the quality of the images was pretty good.’

Mr Avery, who had installed CCTV outside his home after being burgled twice previously, turned the footage over to police and both intruders were charged with burglary.

Despite the clear evidence, 26-year-old Islam protested his innocence at Southampton Crown Court in July.

He was convicted and bailed but failed to turn up for the next hearing in August, so Mr Avery, a sales supervisor who was recently made redundant, stepped in again to bring the offender to justice.

He said: ‘My friends and I had seen 
him brazenly walking around town at least ten times and had reported the
sightings to the police. Nothing happened, it was very frustrating.

‘Someone had to do something, I couldn’t stand by and watch him go about his business without being punished.’

Eventually, with the help of his friends, Mr Avery found out that Islam was working in a city centre shop.

He was re-arrested and jailed for 30 months in December.

Judge Peter Ralls QC heard that 
Islam, from Harefield, near Southampton, was under a community order for
drugs offending when he broke into Mr Avery’s £200,000 home.

The judge said: ‘This was a targeted attack. The victim had been subjected to two previous burglaries.

‘Burglary is always unpleasant for a 
victim and I am satisfied this was deliberately carried out by you with 
planning and organisation. An immediate custodial sentence is the only 
appropriate penalty.’

Sarah Jones, mitigating, said Islam had not re-offended, had been working and intended to lead a law-abiding life from now on.

Islam’s 16-year-old co-accused was given a referral order after admitting burglary at Southampton youth court.
