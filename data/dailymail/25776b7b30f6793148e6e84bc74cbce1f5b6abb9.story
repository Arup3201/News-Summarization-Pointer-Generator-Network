A Georgia police officer beat a pregnant woman so hard that she ended up having a miscarriage because he did not like the 'tone' she was speaking in, a new lawsuit has alleged.

In the $50,000-plus suit, Kenya Harris, says she was called to Albany Police Department (APD) in West Oglethorpe Boulevard in May 2011 after her young son was arrested on unspecified charges.

But after waiting for five hours, she informed officer Ryan Jenkins that she had other children to take care of at home and needed to leave. However, Jenkins reportedly reacted in a 'hostile' manner.

Alleged beating: Georgia-based police officer Ryan Jenkins beat expectant mother Kenya Harris so hard at Albany Police Department (pictured) that she ended up having a miscarriage, a new lawsuit has alleged

He 'stated that he did not appreciate the tone in which she was communicating with him, and further stated that if she continued he would take her head and "put it to the floor",' the suit says.

Shortly after, Harris  tried again to explain that she needed to leave - at which point, Jenkins followed through on his threat with the compliance of another officer, Richard Brown Jr, it is claimed.

Jenkins reportedly grabbed the expectant mother by the neck, before 'slamming her to the ground', causing her to fall unconscious. When she woke up, Jenkins was sitting on her, the suit states.

'Defendant Officer Jenkins, without provocation, grabbed plaintiff, who weighs less than one hundred twenty (120) pounds, by her neck and slammed her to the ground,' it reads.

'Plaintiff momentarily blacked out and came to with defendant Officer Jenkins sitting on her back, and with his knee on her arm. Plaintiff was pregnant at the time.'

Finally, the officer allegedly handcuffed Harris and threw her against the wall.

Despite her pleas for medical attention, she was then transferred to Dougherty County Jail without being seen to by a doctor, it is said.

There, she was held for the night on a charge of obstruction, according to the suit, which was obtained by Courthouse News Service.

It is unknown what stage of pregnancy the alleged victim was at at the time.

After making bail the next day, Harris traveled to Phoebe Convenient Care in Dawson Road, where she discovered she had suffered a miscarriage due to the beating, the suit states.

She was also treated for 'severe physical' injuries, including a knee contusion, neck spasms, muscle pain and bruising to her body, the document, filed in Federal Court, claims.

Now, Harris is suing Jenkins and Brown, as well as Police Chief John Proctor,  for the excessive force, assault, battery and emotional distress that she allegedly suffered at the department. 

In the suit, her lawyer, Nikki Bonner, of Bonner & Penn in Atlanta, claims less force 'should have been used' by Jenkins. If this had been the case, Harris would not have lost her baby, she says.

Harris is seeking more than $50,000, as well as punitive damages.

The suit was filed on February 5. However, city attorneys told Fox 31 that the city has not yet been served. APD added that neither of the officers named in the suit still works for the police force.

On Friday evening, APD had not yet responded to a request for comment by DailyMail.com.
