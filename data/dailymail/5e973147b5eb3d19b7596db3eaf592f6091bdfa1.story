Classical singer Camilla Kerslake, the girlfriend of England rugby captain Chris Robshaw, is to star in a sexed-up opera and says it's about time the art form was modernised.

The 26-year-old, who lives in London with boyfriend Chris, has already forged a career as a  singer after being spotted by Take That star Gary Barlow in 2009.

Since then she has released an album and sung the national anthem in front of her boyfriend and the crowds ahead of kick-off during last autumn's rugby internationals at Twickenham.

Now Miss Kerslake is to take on her most controversial role to date after taking a starring role in a controversial new opera which includes plenty of sex, spirituality and plastic surgery.

The work is the creation of composer Toni Castells and is due to be performed at this year’s Tête à Tête Festival.

‘It is not a traditional opera. It is a bit more about life and everything - and there are some potentially controversial songs,’ she explains.

'In the modern day things like sex, plastic surgery and spirituality need to be addressed. The classic opera is full of murder and adultery but what we are trying to say is more about modern issues.

'It’s to bring those issues out in the open. There’s a song called "Fake Boobs" which basically says it’s substance over the superficial.

'It is targeting people who are image obsessed who are so perfect on the outside but not so beautiful on the inside.'

The opera, which is called Life from Light and was inspired by a BBC documentary exploring the origins of life on Earth, also boasts some toe-tapping tunes, according to Miss Kerslake.

'I loved the music,' she adds. 'It’s a real mish-mash of genres - you can just enjoy it for what it really is.

'It is basically an expression of human condition and is much more accessible to the average person on the street. This is a really exciting way to make opera more mainstream.'

Miss Kerslake will make her Life from Light debut when she performs two songs from the opera at a charity gala in New Zealand on Saturday.

Held in support of the Breast Cancer Aotearoa Coalition, the charity is one that's close to Miss Kerslake's heart, after it helped her mother, Deborah, 51, after she was diagnosed with the disease in 2011.

Her appearance at the gala won't prevent her from cheering on her boyfriend Chris Robshaw the next morning however.

'I will be singing at a club at a charity do then dashing to Auckland for the England game before singing at another event the next day,' says Camilla.

'I’m off the plane then to the venue for my charity gig then I’m off the stage and straight onto the bus for the game. I will definitely be cheering on England.'
