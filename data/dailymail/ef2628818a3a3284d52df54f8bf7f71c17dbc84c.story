Members of Fee Welch's family have been trying to get rid of Sadi the doll for 40 years.

But, mysteriously, every time she is about to be thrown out something happens and she ends up sticking around.

Mrs Welch, from Rockhampton in Queensland, had forgotten the Chucky-like doll was in her house until three weeks ago when she was cleaning out her wardrobe with a friend.

Fee Welch, from Rockhampton in Queensland, found Sadi the doll in her wardrobe three weeks ago. The doll has had a strange power over her family for 40 years and none of them could ever throw it away

As soon Mrs Welch unwrapped her out of her packing plastic, her whole family got sick.

'Itâ€™s a bit weird,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

Mrs Welch, 37, was going to throw Sadi away but her husband found her in the bin and wouldn't let her throw the 'cute' doll away.

'The strange thing is my mum did exactly the same thing years ago, she found her in an old box and went to chuck her out,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'But my dad stopped her and said "What are you throwing her out for, she's cute!"

'It's weird, the men like her.'

Mrs Welch isn't sure what it is about Sadi that provokes such an extreme reaction in people.

Last week she posted a picture of the doll onto a local 'buy, swap and sell' Facebook page to see if anyone ever seen anything similar and the post got so much attention it crashed the page and had to be taken down.

'The admin staff had to delete it because it was clogging the site up and it caused a lot of problems,' she said.

'They said there were over 400 comments.

'People were saying things like "It looks like it belongs in the horror movie Chucky", "Get it out of your house" and "Take all the arms and legs off it and burn it".'

Sadi first came into the family when Mrs Welch's mother bought her as a gift for her sister at a small toy shop in Biloela in central Queensland about 40 years ago.

At some point Mrs Welch's parents packed it up and she isn't exactly sure how it ended up in her home.

Since getting unpacked Sadi has taken up a permanent position on an old chair in the lounge room.

'I'm actually starting to warm up to her, even though she looks like a little freak,' Mrs Welch said.

Mrs Welch said her 13-year-old son hates it but her six-year-old daughter is curious.

'My daughter just said it's weird, but I found her the other day changing her clothes and playing with her,' she said.

'My dog doesn't like her, he barks at her.'

Mrs Welch has been told Sadi could be worth as much as $2000 but she thinks she would struggle to let her go.

'I think with all this hype and stuff I don't think I've got the heart to throw it out,' she said.

Even though the doll has creepy greyish skin and spiky black hair she doesn't think it is possessed.

'I don't think she's haunted I just think she's got a bit of a soul,' she said.

'She comes across like she's spooky and a lot of people are scared by her but deep down I think she just wants to be loved.'
