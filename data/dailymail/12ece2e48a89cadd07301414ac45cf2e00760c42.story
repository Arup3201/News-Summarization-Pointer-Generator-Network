When it comes to the male of the species, an inch makes all the difference.

Two New Jersey men are suing Subway, claiming the world's biggest fast-food chain has been shorting them by selling so-called footlong sandwiches that are closer to 11 inches rather than 12.

The pair - John Farley, of Evesham and Charles Noah Pendrack, of Ocean City - want compensatory damages and a change in Subway's practices.

Just short: Two men are suing because their Subway sandwich came up short, like the other pictured

The suit, filed Tuesday in Superior Court in Mount Holly, may be the first aimed at the sandwich shops after an embarrassment went viral last week when someone posted a photo of a footlong and a ruler on the company's Facebook page to show that the sandwich was not as long as advertised.

At the time, the company issued a statement saying that the sandwich lengths can vary a bit when franchises do not bake to the exact corporate standards.

But Stephen DeNittis, the lawyer for the plaintiffs, says that's no excuse and the missing bite is worth about 45 cents per sandwich. He is seeking class-action status and is also preparing to file a similar suit in Pennsylvania state court in Philadelphia.

He said he's had sandwiches from 17 shops measured - and every one came up short.

'The case is about holding companies to deliver what they've promised,' he said.

Even though the alleged short of a half-inch or so of bread is relatively small, it adds up, he said. Subway has 38,000 stores around the world, nearly all owned by franchisees and its $5 footlong specials have been a mainstay of the company's ads for five years.

Subway's previous adverts, like this popular 'Hula' dance, have suggested that a footlong sandwich will measure one foot in length

How long? This Subway promotion in 2008 showed a range of characters measuring out one foot with their hands

DeNittis said both Farley and Pendrack came to him after reading last week about the short sandwiches.

The Milford, Conn.-based firm should either make sure its sandwiches measure a full foot or stop advertising them as such, he said.

He points to how McDonald's quarter-pounders are advertised as being that weight before they are cooked.

Subway said it couldn't comment on pending or ongoing legal action but the company responded to international criticism that their footlong sandwiches only appear to be 11 inches long on Saturday.

But their reply didn't win them any new fans, as they claimed that the word footlong is a 'registered trademark as a descriptive name for the sub' and 'not intended to be a measurement of length.'

A man in Australia started uproar on January 15 when he posted a photo on the company's Facebook page of one of its footlong subs next to a tape measure showing the sandwich as just 11 inches.

Countless lookalike pictures appeared all over the internet and more than 100,000 people 'liked' or commented on the original, which had the caption 'Subway pls respond.'

Economic Sense: During the recession Subway began advertising $5 footlongs

The world's largest fast food chain 
did so on Friday with a comment on the original query, posted by Matt 
Corby from Perth, Australia.

The
statement began: 'Looking at the photo doing the rounds showing a 
slightly undersized sub, this bread is not baked to our standards.'

Then
Subway went on the offensive, claiming that a footlong sub wasn't 
necessarily meant to be exactly a foot long in the first place.

'With
regards to the size of the bread and calling it a footlong, "SUBWAY 
FOOTLONG" is a registered trademark as a descriptive name for the sub 
sold in Subway® Restaurants and not intended to be a measurement of 
length.'

'The length 
of the bread baked in the restaurant cannot be assured each and every 
time as the proofing process may vary slightly each time in the 
restaurant.'

Subway have since removed the statement but, as Buzzfeed pointed out, this was at odds with previous Subway advertising.

Furor: A man in Australia started uproar on January 15 when he posted a photo on the company's Facebook page of one of its footlong subs next to a tape measure showing the sandwich as just 11 inches

Likes: More than 100,000 people 'liked' or commented on the original, which had the caption 'Subway pls respond'

The
company has suggested in past promotional material that the footlong 
sub will measure a foot in length, such as a popular 2008 'Hula' advert 
(see below).

The Subway
photo — and the backlash — illustrates a challenge companies face with 
the growth of social media sites like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter.

Before,
someone in a far flung local in Australia would not be able to cause 
such a stir. But the power of social media means that negative posts 
about a company can spread from around the world in seconds.

'People
look for the gap between what companies say and what they give, and 
when they find the gap — be it a mile or an inch — they can now raise a 
flag and say, 'Hey look at this,' I caught you,' said Allen Adamson, 
managing director of branding firm Landor Associates in New York.

Subway has always offered footlong sandwiches since it opened in 1965. A customer can order any sandwich as a footlong.

The
chain introduced a $5 footlong promotion in 2008 as the U.S. fell into 
the recession, and has continued offering the popular option throughout 
the recovery.

Response: Subway finally responded on Saturday to the debacle

An attempt to contact someone with 
the same name and country as the person who posted the photo of the 
footlong sandwich on Subway's Facebook page was not returned on 
Thursday.

But comments by other Facebook users about the photo ran the gamut from outrage to indifference to amusement.

One
commenter urged people to 'chill out.' Another one said she was 
switching to Quiznos. And one man posted a photo of his foot in a sock 
next to a Subway sandwich to show it was shorter than a 'foot.'

'I've never seen so many people in an uproar over an inch. Wow,' read one Facebook post.

'Let's all head to McDonald's and weigh a Quarter Pounder,' suggested another poster.

The Subway footlong photo is just the latest in a string of public relations headaches that were caused by a negative photo or event about a company going viral.

Last year, a Burger King employee tweeted a picture of someone standing in sneakers on two tubs of uncovered lettuce. Domino's Pizza employees posted a video on YouTube of workers defacing a pizza in 2009. And a KitchenAid employee last year made a disparaging remark about President Obama using the official KitchenAid Twitter account.
