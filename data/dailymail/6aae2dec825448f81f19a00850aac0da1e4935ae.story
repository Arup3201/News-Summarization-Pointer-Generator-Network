While the world is on tenterhooks waiting for the Duchess of Cambridge to give birth, her family dropped the biggest clue so far last night that perhaps the baby isn't quite ready to make an appearance yet.

Grandparents-to-be Michael and Carole Middleton and their children Pippa and James were invited en masse by the Queen to join her in a royal box at Buckingham Palace.

Looking happy and relaxed, they mingled confidently with members of the royal family watching a gala performance of music and dance from throughout the Queen's reign as part of the Coronation Festival.

Family outing: All of the Middletons, except for heavily pregnant Kate, attended the gala at Buckingham Palace

Floral: Pippa wore a white dress with a flower motif and lace top to the event

Relaxed: Grandfather-to-be Michael Middleton did not seem worried about his eldest daughter's impending labour as he chatted with Pippa

Siblings: Pippa and brother James joined the Queen in the Royal Box for the evening

Sitting two rows behind the Queen, Carole looked supremely elegant in a cream dress and jacket with bracelet sleeves and greeted the first royals to arrive, which included Lady Helen Taylor with warmth and familiarity.

Pippa and James waved and exchanged greetings with Zara Phillips, who was making her first public appearance since announcing she was pregnant earlier this week and hid any baby bump under a loose fitting patterned shift dress.

Sources have told the Mail that Kate is feeling so comfortable and relaxed even in these latter stages of her pregnancy that she even considered attending the performance with her family tonight, but eventually decided against it.

The other grandparents to be, Prince 
Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, were also present and accompanied 
the Queen who would normally have Prince Philip by her side. He is still
 recovering from abdominal surgery.

Celebration: The Queen was joined by Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall at the festival to mark the 60th anniversary of her coronation

Loose-fitting: Any signs of a baby bump were concealed under Zara Phillips's floral dress

Svelte: Sophie, Countess of Wessex, showed off her slim figure in a white dress with an unusual feather ruff

The Duke of York, Princess Eugenie and the Earl and Countess of Wessex were also in the front row.

Sophie was showing off her newly svelte figure in a form fitting cream dress, which was rather spoilt by a bizarre feather ruff around her neck.

Each member of the royal box had a blue blanket on their seat in case of a drop in temperature.

Among the performers were Katherine Jenkins and Dame Kiri Te Kanawa.
