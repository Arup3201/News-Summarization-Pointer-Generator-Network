A personal trainer has been diagnosed with a brain tumour on the day his mother finished treatment for breast cancer.

Scott Dixon, 24, should have been celebrating with his mother, Jackie Dixon, 56, but instead he was preparing for radiotherapy.

He said: ‘She had planned a bit of a celebration that night, but then everything changed.

Scott Dixon, 24, was diagnosed with a brain tumour the day that his mother, Jackie Dixon, finished treatment for breast cancer. Mr Dixon started radiotherapy as his mother was recovering from chemotherapy

‘It was really tough.’

As a result, Ms Dixon, from South Shields, in Tyne and Wear, finished her own chemotherapy and radiotherapy and immediately started looking after her youngest son.

‘It was horrible, just so unbelievable,’ said the grandmother-of-five. ‘But I think because it was the last day of my treatment I could then just think about Scott.

‘I just totally put me out of my mind and it really meant I could really think about getting Scott through his treatment, he was so poorly.’

Mr Dixon, who also lives in South Shields, was fit and healthy when he started to notice a problem with his left eye.

A trip to the opticians saw him referred to hospital before specialists at the Freeman Hospital, in Newcastle, uncovered the cause of his problems.

Mr Dixon was diagnosed after going to see his optician about a problem with his left eye. The optician referred him to hospital where the tumour was discovered

In August and September 2012 he underwent radiotherapy every day for six weeks.

Mr Dixon says that his son Lewis, five, and unborn daughter, Scarlett, with girlfriend Chantelle Watson, kept him going.

‘I had to have an operation on my brain in December last year because they found lesions at the front of the brain,’ he said.

‘I actually found out I was having a daughter on the day of my operation, she’s four-months now.

‘My son Lewis was a little diamond throughout it. He kept me smiling throughout it all,’ said Mr Dixon, who has just returned to work.

Now Mr Dixon, who is on the road to recovery, is hoping to pay back the North East charity which helped him through his treatment - the Toma Fund.

‘My mum took me for my treatment in Newcastle every day in her car,’ he said.

‘But then we found out there was a problem with the engine and it would cost £400 to get it fixed.

‘We relied on that car so much and I was facing a two hour round trip on the Metro to go for radiotherapy every day,’ said Mr Dixon.

And that is when he was introduced to the Toma Fund, a charity set up by Andrea and Dave Thompson who lost their son, Jordan, to leukaemia when he was 15.

The charity hands out grants to children and young people in the North East going through cancer treatment, and helped Mr Dixon to mend the car.

Now, to give something back to the charity which helped him so much, Mr Dixon has recruited up to 15 of his clients to run the Great North Run for the Toma Fund.
