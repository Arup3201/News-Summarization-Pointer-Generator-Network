Thankful: Jeff Bauman, 28, has thanked his rescuers and the city of Boston for their support

Boston bombing survivor Jeff Bauman has penned a moving letter to the city, thanking its residents, volunteers and emergency responders for saving his life.

'Thank you for being there for me,' he wrote. 'Thank you for kicking ass. Thank you for proving that nothing will ever stop us from being who we are.'

The letter appeared on the commemorative fold out cover of the Boston Herald on Tuesday - marking the one-year anniversary of the bombings that killed three, injured 270 and cost Bauman, 28, both of his legs.

In the note, he revealed that he will not be attending the Boston Marathon next Monday, even though he had initially planned to walk and show the crowd how far he had come.

Instead, he will be spending the day with his family, a decision he believes is best for his health.

'In
 the end, this city doesn't need me to prove anything,' he wrote. 'You 
prove every day what kind of city you are: The best in the world.'

Bauman
 was standing near the finish line with friends waiting for his 
girlfriend, Erin Hurley, to complete the marathon when the bomb went 
off, destroying his legs and rupturing his eardrums.

A
 now-iconic image showing an ashen-faced Bauman being wheeled to medical
 attention by three rescuers has come to represent the horror the city 
witnessed that day.

In the letter, he thanked those 
people who rushed to his aid - 'without your courage, I would not be 
alive today' - doctors, nurses and police officers: 'You acted like we 
were people, not victims.'

He also thanked people across the country for sending messages, gifts and donations.

'Especially the children who broke open their piggy banks to send us their life savings,' he wrote. 'Thank you. You changed our lives.'

He also thanked the crowds at the Bruins game - where he waved a flag and stood just two months after the tragedy - and the Red Sox game, where he threw out the ceremonial first pitch.

'I didn't want to do it,' he wrote. 
'I thought it was pathetic that I couldn't get out of my wheelchair. I 
thought that if I tried to stand up and fell down, then everyone would 
laugh at me. Or even worse, feel sorry for me.

'But when I heard you cheering, I 
knew that I didn't have to prove anything. You were happy to have me 
there, just the way I was. I'm sorry the Bruins lost.'

After the bombings, Bauman underwent 
multiple surgeries and was fitted with often-painful prosthetics as he 
slowly learned to walk again.

'Right
 now, you know, it's kind of a challenge to put my legs on every day. 
I'm not used to it. It's something unnatural for me,' he said in an 
interview last week.

'But I
 think over time it will become more of a natural thing. At first I 
couldn't even wear them for 20 minutes... Now, I can wear them all day.'

Last week he released a book, 'Stronger', detailing the grueling months after the tragedy.

In
 the book, he credits his family, colleagues and, in particular, his 
girlfriend Erin with saving his emotional health. The couple recently 
revealed that they were engaged in February and are expecting their 
first child in July.

'I tend to think tragedy gives you perspective,' he wrote. 'Who can I be honest with, without being afraid of their reaction? The answer always came up Erin.'

He also fostered a close relationship with one of his rescuers, Carols Arredondo, the man beside him wearing the cowboy hat. Arredondo attended the sports games with him and regularly visited him in hospital.

In an interview with ABC, Arredondo revealed he still suffers flashbacks, is unable to sleep and is uneasy in large crowds. His wife Melida said she also suffers from nightmares and sees a counselor.

But the couple, who lost both of their sons - one to a sniper in Iraq and the other to suicide - said that the bombings have allowed them a second chance at family.

'Jeff and Erin, they fill a place - they never could never replace Alex or Brian - but having them in our lives eases things,' Melida Arredondo said. 'It helps, and we just enjoy spending time together.'
