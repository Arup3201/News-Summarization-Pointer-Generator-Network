A new high-security  fence erected in Calais to stop migrants crossing the Channel to Britain has been blown over in 100mph winds.

Sections of the 12ft steel barrier, which was only installed at the French port last month, were flattened  on Friday night as storms wreaked havoc on both side of the English Channel. 

The incident could have led to chaos in the French port, amid fears migrants would take the opportunity to invade the terminal. But the high winds also prompted ferry services to be cancelled.

The fence, which is topped with razor wire to deter refugees, was funded through a £12m grant from Britain to help French authorities tighten security at the terminal. 

A Calais police spokesman said: 'The fence had only been up for a matter of weeks.

'It provided a second layer of security for the ferry port after repeated attempts to break into the terminal by migrants during the summer.

'Work has already begun to repair the damaged sections of the fence, and full security should be restored in several days.'

Tensions have been mounting in Calais in recent months as hundreds more refugees fleeing war zones in the Middle East and poverty in Africa flood across Europe. 

At least 15 migrants died during 2014 as they tried to get to Britain from France, either by drowning in the sea, or being knocked over by lorries. 

Before the fence was erected, 250 illegal immigrants stormed the ferry terminal in a bid to board ferries and lorries bound for the UK.

After the incident in October, Home Secretary Theresa May promised to give France £12m to tighten security. 

The UK also offered Calais an 11-mile long high security fence used at a NATO summit in Wales to keep the migrants out of the terminal. 

Meanwhile, authorities have been busy setting up a 'cold weather emergency centre' for migrants in the town.

The heated hostel - which is to be used when temperatures fall below -5C - was opened today as the mercury plummeted to below freezing. 

A spokesman said: 'We had around five hundred people in over Friday night, and numbers should increase up to around fifteen hundreds over coming days.

'At the moment the centre is a provisional one, but it will become more permanent as the winter progresses.'

The 40,000sq ft warehouse has the capability to house 1,500 of the estimated 3,000 refugees currently living rough in the northern French port.

Complete with hot showers and mattresses, it is easy walking distance of the main ferry port. 

The British government had argued that providing beds and showers for migrants will only encourage many more to come to Calais hoping to stow away aboard lorries and ferries to Dover. 

It is the first large-scale facility since the controversial Sangatte Red Cross hostel was bulldozed in 2002. 

Sangatte was used as a stepping stone to Britain by an estimated 18,000 refugees over six years. 

Calais prefect Denis Robin said the new centre would only be open on certain nights, with migrants being forced out by 9am each morning.

He said: 'The cold weather plan will provide shelter for all those people left outside when temperatures fall.

'We need a space that can house around 1,500 people, that they can reach on foot, but one that is not in the town centre, because encouraging migrants to remain in the town centre is a sensitive issue in Calais.'

A separate day centre offering hot food and showers to only the most vulnerable women, children and elderly migrants is also set to be opened in January.

Mr Robin insisted the shelters were 'humanitarian gestures', adding: 'Neither of these centres are in any way new Sangatte-type hostels in Calais.'

Calais Mayor Natacha Bouchart blames the UK's generous state benefits for their influx of migrants, saying Britain was viewed as 'an Eldorado'.
