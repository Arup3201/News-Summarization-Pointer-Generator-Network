Wanted for amassing a collection of photos and images numbering in the hundreds and suspected in a sex attack last year, authorities had Stanley Simms in their grasp, even questioning him while searching his home.But Simms, 47, of Sunrise, FL, simply walked away after cops searched his home, according to reports. Not seen since June 7, the day police seized his pornography-rich computer, he is also considered a suspect in a sexual assault investigation dating back to last year, officials said.“We want to get him off the streets,” Jim Marshall, spokesman at the FBI’s Miami division, told local media.

On the run: The FBI is asking for the public's help in finding accused pedophile Stanley Simms, 47, of Sunrise, FL

The computer found by law enforcement during a June 7 search of Simms’ home held over 200 child pornography files, according to the Sun-Sentinal. It was originally found sharing both movies and pictures on a file-sharing network in September, the paper reported.Simms told investigators the files were downloaded by accident during a June 7 search of his home, according to the paper, which also reported the officials declined to comment this week on why Simms was allowed to leave his home later that afternoon without being arrested – despite a federal warrant being issued for his arrest that day.

Federal officials also have questions for the accused pedophile about an incident in which a south Florida woman was allegedly drugged and sexually assaulted in December, the Miami Herald reported.Known to frequent ‘adult entertainment clubs’ in south Florida, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Simms is said to drive a green/gray BMW and/or a purple pickup truck.

‘If there’s someone out there who has information on where [Simms] is, please call the FBI, call the local police. Don’t approach him yourself,’ Marshall’s statement continued.

Attempts by Mail Online to reach the FBI’s Miami office were unsuccessful.

This is not the first time the feds have asked for help tracking down a suspected pedophile.

On the lam: Simms left his home June 7, the same day investigators discovered his trove of kiddie porn and issued a warrant for his arrest, he hasn't been seen since

In May, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials asked for help finding a man seen committing graphic sexual assaults against a young girl estimated to be between seven and nine-years-old in four separate videos filmed the prior month.The videos were so graphic the images had to be ‘sanitized’ before they were able to be released to the public.

Identified as ‘John Doe,’ the only leads investigators have to go on are a Frito-Lay Rold Gold thin pretzels bag seen in the videos and music equipment strewn all over the room where the depraved acts were filmed.

Rold Gold pretzels are available only in the U.S. and Canada, and the packaging – in English – is seen only in the States, according to officials.Anyone with information regarding the whereabouts of Stanley Simms is urged to call the FBI’s Miami field office at (305) 944-9101

ICE also urges anyone with information about the identity or whereabouts of the the man to the right to call 1-866-347-2423 from the U.S. and Canada, or 1-802-872- 6199 from anywhere else in the world.
