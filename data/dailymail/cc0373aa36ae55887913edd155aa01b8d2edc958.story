A police force making cuts of £50million is using unqualified detectives to investigate serious crimes because of a 'critical' shortage of staff.

A whistleblower said officers had been moved into the Criminal Investigation Department in Brighton, West Sussex - which deals with murders and rapes - without taking compulsory detective exams.

Sussex Police has now admitted officers had to be moved into Brighton CID 'temporarily' to keep up the numbers, prompting a warning from the county's Police Commissioner.

The whistleblower reported his concerns to local newspaper the Brighton Argus.

There was a 'critical shortage of police officers across the entire Brighton and Hove division,' the anonymous detective said.

He added: 'Officers are having to be drafted in from other departments with almost no notice and with many of these officers not even having passed the detectives exam - a national requirement - and with little or no additional training to prepare them for dealing with the serious crimes investigated by CID.

'It is not uncommon to see my 
colleagues on the verge of tears because they are under so much pressure
 and stress and have more work than they can cope with.

'This is nothing short of scandalous and not only puts the public at increased risk but the officers themselves.'

A spokesman for Sussex Police admitted there were officers working in CID without the relevant qualifications but insisted they were all 'experienced investigators.'

The spokesman also admitted the department was not operating at a 100 per cent staffing level.

Superintendent Steve Whitton, of Sussex Police, said: 'Policing, by its very nature, requires a flexible approach.

'Often this means moving officers, all of whom are trained and competent to investigate crime, into different departments.

'This is why we have recently temporarily moved a number of people into our CID to ensure that we can continue to respond effectively to crimes such as rape and sexual assault.

'We are going through challenging times at the moment and having to make some difficult decisions regarding our resources but, as with all our decision making, the needs of the public always come first.'

Sussex Police and Crime Commissioner Katy Bourne said she would investigate and public safety remains her highest priority.

She added: 'Should I find any evidence that officer and staff resilience is affecting police performance I will hold the Chief Constable to account for this on behalf of Sussex residents.'

Sussex Police came under fire by 
inspectors last year after axing frontline officers in a bid to meet 
government-imposed cuts of £50million between 2011 and 2015.

HM Inspectorate of Constabulary revealed the force was one of just three in the country reducing its number of frontline staff.

'The force is not managing to protect its frontline crime fighting capability as effectively as it should,' the report said.

The report acknowledged the challenge was tough because Sussex had lower costs than other forces, but it added: 'There are early indications that the service to the public might be starting to diminish.

'Over the last two years Sussex has reduced crime at a substantially lower rate than most other forces.'
