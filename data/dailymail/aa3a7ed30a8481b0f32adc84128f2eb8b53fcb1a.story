When one mother from California put her son down for a nap after getting a new puppy, she couldn't have imagined what was about to happen.

And a week after pictures of baby Beau curled up to sleep with puppy Theo went viral, Jessica Shyba says she can't believe how popular the pair have become.

Speaking to KTVU, the mother-of-three said: 'I'm completely flabbergasted. It's beyond anything I've ever dreamed.'

Mother Jessica Shyba said the public's reaction to her pictures is 'beyond anything I have ever dreamed'

The first snooze: Theo started sleeping on his toddler-owner Beau when he accidentally fell asleep on the baby when he was being rocked for an afternoon nap one day

She added: 'I think there is just so much bad news in the world, all the time every day, that is all we see.

'Based on the responses that I'm getting, it's the peacfulness and the natural way that they are together. It's sweet and it's innocent and it's lovely and people appreciate it and I appreciate it.'

Now Ms Shyba is using her new-found fame to ask people to donate to their local pet rescue home, after she adopted Theo - a part Boxer, part Shepherd, part Labrador Retriever - from Santa Cruz SPCA.

That rescue centre is currently appealing for $1.5million (£930,000) to start work on a new building after already raising $3million (£1.8million).

Make yourself comfortable: The Shyba family in Santa Cruz, California got Theo when he was just 7-weeks-old this month

Snuggle buddies: While they intended to crate train the puppy, mother Jessica Shyba decided she couldn't bear to hear the puppy cry at night

The pictures, posted on her blog, have 
attracted millions of views and thousands of comments since they were 
posted last Thursday.

She says the nap-time ritual started three days after they took Theo, who 23-month-old Beau calls 'Bee-bo', home with them.

At first the family had decided to crate train the dog, from a litter of 11, by making him sleep alone, but his cries were too much for them to bear.

The dog spent his first night on the sofa with Jessica's partner, Justin, and then the second night sleeping with her.

But on the third afternoon, as she was rocking baby Beau to sleep, Theo decided to join in by laying on top of him, and was soon fast asleep too.

Cozy: Mother Jessica Shyba says she almost woke the two up the first time they fell asleep for a nap because she was 'practically howling at the cuteness'

Cushy: Theo finds a place to rest his head in Beau's armpit

Stretched out: Each day, Theo waits outside the bedroom for nap time and settles in next to Beau once the toddler has fallen asleep

Jessica says she nearly woke both of them up after 'practically howling at the cuteness' but managed not to, and since then the two have been inseparable.

Jessica added: 'The following day, Theo met us up in my room for the nap time ritual, and so began what I can only describe as the most organic and beautiful friendship I have ever witnessed.'

Every afternoon for the past week the pair have slept side-by-side, and Jessica says Theo now knows when it is time for a nap and waits at the end of the bed.

She says she has to get Beau off to sleep first, otherwise the dog will wake him up, but after he is asleep she puts Theo onto the bed who totters over to the sleeping toddler before dropping off himself.

The duo then sleep intertwined for up to two hours at a time.

Lean on me: The puppy and the toddler share an uncommon bond

Wrapped up: The two have synched their sleep schedules

More to come: Mrs Shyba promises to continue posting nap time pictures on Instagram under the #TheoandBeau
