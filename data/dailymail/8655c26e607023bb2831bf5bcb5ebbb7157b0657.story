Nicky Deverdics thought he was destined for a future in the top flight when he was training with Alan Shearer, Craig Bellamy and Gary Speed at Newcastle as a teenager, under the tutelage of Sir Bobby Robson.

Fresh-faced from Newcastle’s academy, having signed professional terms there at 16-years-old, he was awestruck when opportunities arose to take part in sessions with the first-team at their Darlsey Park training facility.

Back then he tried to keep his head down, keep it simple and avoid becoming the butt of their jokes.

Little did he know at that stage that his career would take him plummeting down the football pyramid, into the the murky depths of non-League to spells playing abroad in Iceland and the Faroe Islands, at times without a club and on the verge of giving it all up.

But after sticking with it, the 27-year-old is set to test his ability against Barclays Premier League opposition when his Conference side Dover face Crystal Palace in the FA Cup Third Round.

‘Newcastle had probably their best team when I was coming through,’ Deverdics, a life-long Newcastle fan, explains.

'When you’re a youngster with the first team you’re just trying to get on and do nothing wrong. Just pass the ball, keep under the radar so they don’t start coming at you with their banter. Otherwise you’re in trouble.

‘You make sure you do things right. Keep your head down. It was great playing with them and seeing their quality. But in my second year it was all change, Graeme Souness came in and Glenn Roeder became academy manager and he released me.’

Stefan Payne, striker, 23

He is on fire at the moment with nine goals in his last 12 games. He’s scoring goals and looking like he’ll score every game. He’s strong but he’s pacy at the same time, a real handful. He’ll work for the full 90 minutes and he won’t give defenders a rest.

Connor Essam, centre-back, 22

He has led the team really well as stand-in skipper. He’s so strong at the back, solid as a rock, and he popped up with the goal to knock Cheltenham Town out last round.

Andy Rafferty, goalkeeper, 26

He kept seven clean sheets on the spin at home this season and only conceded two all season in nine games on our turf. He’s been brilliant for us. He’s come on loan from Hartlepool, and we couldn’t believe he hadn’t been playing for them. He’s been huge.

Deverdics admits, frankly, that at 18 his attitude was the key factor in the demise of his career.

‘I was immature and clueless,’ he says.

‘Glenn had me playing left back but I’m an attacking central midfielder.

'Being so young and at Newcastle I was thinking something else will come up.

‘I played up a bit. My attitude was the reason they let me go. I regret it. Thinking I knew it all was the problem.’

Deverdics’ Hungarian surname – pronounced Dev-er-dich – which comes from his grandfather belies the lad who was born and bred in Gateshead and still maintains a thick Geordie accent despite living in Milton Keynes now. 

He turned to his local club, in the sixth tier of English football, when no-one came calling for his services after being ditched by Newcastle.

‘It was a wakeup call,’ he says. ‘It was like fight football. It was scrappy. If you’ve got anything about you they just want to smash you.

‘It didn’t work out for me, the manager told me he can’t play me because the other players weren’t reading what I was trying to do. I was giving the ball away because the players weren’t reading the passes I was making.’

Still a teenager, he tumbled even further down the pyramid and had a brief spell at Bedlington Terriers before moving to Gretna and winning promotion from Scottish Division One in the last minute of the last game of the season.

But, like so much of Deverdics’ career, it went wrong. He was finally playing back at a level he felt his ability warranted, in the Scottish Premier League, when Gretna’s owner, businessman Brooks Mileson, died after suffering a heart attack and falling into his pond. The club ceased to exist after finishing the season and Deverdics was back on the transfer scrap heap.

This prompted his next move to Barnet, then in League Two, where he played in the same midfield as Yannick Bolasie, who he will come up against on Sunday.

‘He was raw back then,’ Deverdics remembers. ‘He had the skill he has now, he’d do something with the ball, a movement of quick feet, and you’d think, “I could try that 100 times and it ain’t happening.”

‘He’s got that bit of ridiculousness. He just makes it up on the spot at times, it comes to him a split second earlier than other people think.’

Yet while the other three in that midfield of Bolasie and Albert Adomah, who plays for Middlesbrough, on the wings and Neal Bishop, who is now at Scunthrope, in the centre, went upwards, Deverdics went down again.

A pre-season at Blyth Spartans, in the Conference North, had only meant to be to maintain fitness, but that turned into a whole season and for the first time since he signed professional terms at Newcastle Deverdics was not playing full-time. ‘I scratched my head at how three had gone one way and I went the other,’ he adds.

Deverdics needed to get away and flew to Iceland with Tomi Ameobi, the middle brother of Shola and Sammy, where they played for BÍ/Bolungarvík in the tiny town of Isafjorour with a population of 3,000. 

But though the mountainous scenery where the sun bounced off the fjord every morning was ‘like something out of a James Bond movie, you felt like someone was going to parachute over the top,’ Deverdics was left more shaken than stirred by the poor quality of football and quickly left.

He tried abroad again at Faroe Islands club TB Tvøroyri, where it was even worse. ‘You see lads having kebabs the night before games, or going to pizza shop just before a match, you think, “what’s going on?” It was an eye-opener, made me realise I needed to back in England where people take football as seriously as me.’

Deverdics was determined not to give up, contrary to the advice of others, staying single to devote his life to football. He was lured to a showcase event at the Etihad Stadium with the promise of scouts and agents in attendance.

‘I turned up and it was absolutely garbage,’ he recalls. ‘I’d been sold something, told there would be out-of-work former pros there, top quality players, but most of them had never, ever played Football League. Kids were turning up who would’ve done well to get in my school team. When I was 12. But there was a little silver lining.’

Deverdics’ current agents picked him up from there. When they got him in at Dover last July, he had no idea he would be pitting himself against Premier League opposition so soon.

‘They couldn’t have got me further away from Newcastle if they tried. They might as well have spoken to a few clubs in France,’ he jokes.

‘There’ve been plenty of times when people have told me to let it go, but I’m adamant I’ve got a point to prove in this country.

‘My aim is to get back into the Football League, whether it’s with Dover or somewhere else longer-term. I’m genuinely enjoying my football for the first time in a long time.’
