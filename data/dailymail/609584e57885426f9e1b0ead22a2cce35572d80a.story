One California couple had a very unique wedding over the holidays.

Robert Bonilla and his bride Meredith of Santa Maria decided to say 'I do' at the very spot they met a year ago - Costco. 

They were even able to get the store to let them have the ceremony in the frozen food section, the exact spot that the two first locked eyes.

The bride walked down an aisle lined with poinsettias to meet her groom

The bride walked down an aisle lined with poinsettias last week to meet her groom, who stood on wooden pallets waiting for the chance to kiss his bride.

Then, following the vows, the two 'shared time with friends, and found a cushy double recliner chair to relax in' according to KEYT.

As for the reception, that seems to have taken place at the couple's new home, though the cakes appear to be from their favorite place in the world - Costco. 

It is unknown if the couple has any honeymoon plans.
