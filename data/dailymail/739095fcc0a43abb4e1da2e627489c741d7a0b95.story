This pigeon got more than he bargained for when he 'tawt he'd seen a puddy tat'.

In a scene like something out of Sylvester and Tweety Bird, the bird miraculously escaped from the jaws of a lion at Adelaide Zoo, in Australia.

The pigeon flew straight at the big cat's cage not realising it was being eyed up dinner.

In a split second, the lion armed with his killer claws and razor sharp teeth, pounced on the bird as it flew inches from its face.

All bets would have been on the lion but as it opened its jaws to get a better grip the lucky pigeon flew to see another day.

And from the look on the lion's face, he was spitting feathers.

These incredible action shots were taken by photographer David Gartland, from Aldinga, who was at the zoo with his family.

He told news.com.au: 'It'a always about being at the right place at the right time.

'I didn't have a chance to do any fancy settings which was good because that blurred the bird'.

Adelaide Zoo is Australia's second oldest zoo and the only major metropolitan zoo in Australia to be owned and operated on a non-profit basis.

It is located in parklands just north of the city centre in South Australia.
