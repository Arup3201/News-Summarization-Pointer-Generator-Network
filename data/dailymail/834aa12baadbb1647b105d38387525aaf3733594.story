Members of the armed forces and police officers involved in the security of the London Olympics are to be presented with commemorative coins for their sterling work.

Primer minister David Cameron said that the 18,000 soldiers, sailors and airmen who were part of the operation, many of them drafted in at late notice when private security firm G4S failed to provide sufficient staff, will receive the coin.

The design of the coin is still being worked on, and will be presented to the security workers at the end of the Paralympic Games in September.

Thousands of officers from the Metropolitan Police and forces from across the UK will also qualify, although Downing Street said the exact criteria for qualifying had not yet been finalised.

Mr Cameron said that the coins were to show the nation's 'enormous gratitude' to the troops and security staff for helping to deliver a safe and secure 2012 Olympics.

The Games went without a hitch in terms of security, as 80,000 people converged on the Olympic Park stadium daily - and thousands more at the other Olympic venues across the capital - which ended last night with a closing ceremony as spectacular as Danny Boyle's opener.

The purple-uniformed Games volunteers are to receive a commemorative 'baton' for their efforts, and a further 18,000 will receive this who were recruited by the government to serve as Games 'ambassadors'.

Mr Cameron said: 'The volunteers, members of the armed forces, police and others who worked on the Games are the ones who made them possible.

'These people not only gave up their time, but brought a phenomenal energy and passion to the streets and to Olympic venues up and down the country.

'So I hope what will stay with the volunteers will be the experience of a lifetime in helping to make London 2012 the monumental success that it was.

'These coins and batons are just a small permanent token of the enormous gratitude we all have for them.

'The passion and professionalism of the volunteers has been matched by the fantastic work of the armed forces and the police, who have worked tirelessly to deliver a safe and secure Games.

'I am delighted to be giving a commemorative coin to everyone who helped to deliver the biggest peacetime security operation this country has ever seen.

'I also want to say a big thank you to everyone else who worked during the Olympic Games: the G4S staff and contractors, transport workers and all those who, along with our volunteers, the army and the police, helped to show the world what a fantastic country the United Kingdom is. They are the very best of Britain.'

Downing Street said they were also considering awarding the coin to further people involved in the smooth sunning of the Games, including the ambulance services and the fire brigade.

The security staff's being awarded the commemorative coin comes amidst G4S's announcement that they are to donate £2.5million to the armed forces as a 'goodwill gesture'.

The private security firm was forced to apologise after failing to deliver on their £284million Games contract after they failed to provide the 10,000 adequately trained staff.

Additional troops were drafted in to work alongside the G4S workers.

Defence secretary Philip Hammond said the donation would 'go some way' to recognising the burden placed on the armed forces by the security shambles.

He said: 'The armed forces provided more to the security and protection of the Games than had originally been planned, but as always they have carried out their tasks with professionalism and good humour.

'This contribution from G4S is welcome news for the service welfare funds and will go some way to recognising the inconvenience and extra burden that this commitment has placed upon our forces and their families.'

The donation will go towards welfare amenities including sports equipment and to sports associations which have backed the athletes.

Chief of the defence staff General Sir David Richards said: 'The armed forces are pleased to accept this donation from G4S.

'It recognises all the hard work and commitment service personnel have displayed during the London 2012 Olympic Games. Together with G4S, the men and women of the Royal Navy, army and RAF have delivered a safe and secure Olympics.'
