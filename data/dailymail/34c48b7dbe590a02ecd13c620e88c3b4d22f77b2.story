Rip-off charges which can destroy the value of a worker's hard-earned pension should be banned 'without delay', a report from MPs will warn today

Rip-off charges which can destroy the value of a worker’s hard-earned pension should be banned ‘without delay’, a report from MPs will warn today.

The ‘consultancy charges’ are made when a boss takes advice about signing up his workers to a pension scheme - but the worker, rather than the boss, will pick up the bill.

The report, from the influential Work and Pensions Committee, warns these charges can be ‘extremely high’ and have ‘the potential to cause serious consumer detriment.’

Dame Anne Begg, the committee’s Labour chairman, said: ‘The plethora of costs and charges that can be applied to pension pots are not only confusing.

‘They can seriously impact on an individual’s retirement income.’ 

She is ‘particularly concerned’ about consultancy charges, including those paid by current workers as well as workers who have left the company but were members of its pension scheme.

Dame Anne said: ‘Neither can be justified. Both should be banned.’ It gives the example of two workers called ‘Mr Smith’ and ‘Miss Snow’ who both contribute the same amount of money into their pension, but Miss Snow pays a lower charge.

After 43 years paying into their pension pots, her pension is worth £78,000, but his pension is worth only £63,000 after paying an extra £15,000 in fees.

The report warned: ‘We are very concerned by the high level of such charges quoted in some advisers’ literature and the potential for this to reduce significantly the size of scheme members’ pension post, and ultimately their income in retirement.’

Last night, the Department for Work and Pensions said it has already begun an investigation into the controversial issue of consultancy charges.

Steve Webb, the Pensions Minister, wrote to the Association of British Insurers last year saying he is ‘increasingly concerned’ about them.

He warned: ‘They should only be deducted from an individual’s [pension] pot where there is a tangible benefit to that individual.’

The timing is urgent because millions of workers are currently being signed up into a company pension scheme for the first time in their life.

'Consultancy charges' are made when a boss takes advice about signing up his workers to a pension scheme - but the worker, rather than the boss, will pick up the bill

Under new rules, introduced in October, all workers who do not currently have a company pension are being ‘auto-enrolled’ by their boss into a retirement scheme.

A DWP spokesman said: ‘We have been gathering evidence on consultancy charging and will announce a decision in due course.’ One pension expert, who did not want to be named, said: ‘Consultancy charges could just wipe out the whole point of saving.

‘It will put lots of people off. They will get a letter after their first year of saving into a pension and think: ‘Where has all my money gone?’ 

Dr Ros Altmann, an independent pensions expert and former Number 10 adviser, said workers must be protected from ‘unfair and inappropriate charges.’ 

She said: ‘At the moment, it is perfectly permissible for unqualified, unregulated advisers to charge auto-enrolled workers for advice that is only given to the employer.

‘Anyone giving advice to the workers themselves would need to be fully qualified and regulated, but because the advice is going to the employer, the regulatory protections are not being applied.

‘That is despite the fact that the workers’ pension fund is paying for the advice that the employer receives. This is clearly wrong and should be banned immediately.’ 

Tom McPhail, head of pensions research at the advisers Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ‘I am particularly concerned about lower paid, frequent job changers who could see a substantial portion of their retirement savings lost as a result of consultancy charging.’
