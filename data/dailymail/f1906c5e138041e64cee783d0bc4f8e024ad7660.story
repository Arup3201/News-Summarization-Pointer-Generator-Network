With several new signings on show for Manchester United against QPR on Sunday, a sense of excitement was back at Old Trafford.

Daley Blind and Marcos Rojo started the Premier League game in front of their home fans for the first time, but it was Angel Di Maria and Ander Herrera who really impressed.

Di Maria stole the show with his direct running and trickery, while Herrera's goal summed up his box-to-box performance.

Angel Di Maria scored Manchester United's first at Old Trafford in the 4-0 win against QPR on Sunday

Sandro and the rest of the visiting midfield couldn't handle Manchester United's new superb No 7

United lined up with a diamond formation, and four at the back for the first time this season. That meant Argentina's World Cup left back Rojo could line up in that position for his new side, while Blind was used in the role Ajax preferred him in, the base of the midfield.

Di Maria and Herrera were given the 'running roles' in midfield, providing width for the first part, but also covering centrally when needed. The former in particular, excelled in this role.

The 26-year-old winger was experimented in the role last season by Argentina and Real Madrid, with Carlo Ancelotti praising his dynamism and work rate in certain fixtures, particularly against Barcelona. That speed and energy was on show again versus QPR, with the majority of United's attacks coming down the left.

Di Maria was often laying the ball off before sprinting for a quick one-two, while his lung-busting runs on and off the ball were difficult for Mauricio Isla to handle.  

Excitement levels soared every time Angel Di Maria touched the ball... his pace was frightening

Marcos Rojo excelled down the left hand side and formed a partnership with Argentina team mate Di Maria

Marcos Rojo was unlucky not to be credited with an assist after a fine run resulted in a well placed cross

He also worked well down that side with Rojo, as they did for Argentina in the World Cup, and the former Sporting Lisbon man was unlucky not to be credited with an assist after his fine run forward was matched by a neat cross to find Herrera. Robin van Persie poked the ball away from the Spaniard at the final second.

The Cristiano Ronaldo, Ryan Giggs effect was clear every time Di Maria had it; the crowd were on the edge of their seats in the knowledge something would happen when the ball was at his feet.

With Wayne Rooney and Van Persie asked to spread to provide more width at times, that also gave Di Maria space to run at Sandro centrally when he wanted. 

His inadvertent goal from a sublime crossed free-kick was certainly deserved, and as his confidence grew in the second half the tricks came out. The supporters were in awe as a couple of back heels from Di Maria in his own half left the QPR players dumbfounded.

United fans have got used to their No 7's producing the spectacular, and they have surely found another one to do just that. Pinpoint accuracy with his crosses, outside of the foot finesse and the quick feet to humiliate anybody. Di Maria is the Real deal from Madrid. 

Daley Blind started at the base of the diamond and impressed technically, but he will need to improve physically

Michael Carrick's injury gave Blind the chance to impress in his favoured role, 'No 6'. The 24-year-old has been used as utiliy player throughout his career, and has operated at left-back, centre midfield, and even centre back for his national team.

Patrick Kluivert described him in the build-up as an 'extremely intelligent player' tactically, and his technical ability was clear to see, especially given the midfield options United have had in the past. Blind started moves from the back, read the game well and has a wand of a left foot.

One attribute he may want to build on is of a physical nature, with Leroy Fer dominating him at times. Opposing teams may look to target this in the future. 

Ander Herrera netted his first goal for Manchester United from the edge of the box against QPR

Ander Herrera started at the right of a midfield diamond but popped up in a number of positions

Herrera was another man who was brought in (albeit by David Moyes initially) with the view to being able to fulfill several tactical duties. 

His favourite position would probably be the tip of this diamond, but he performed well on the right hand side. 

He was possibly United's most dangerous player in and around the box, often arriving late and could have had more than his one goal in the first half alone. 

He was occasionally caught in possession when looking for a spectacular long range pass, but as with Di Maria, his energy and ability would have been extremely pleasing for Van Gaal.

Radamel Falcao came on late on for Juan Mata as he joined up with Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie up top

Radamel Falcao was the man all United fans were dying to see make his debut, but they were made to wait for the Colombian striker.

Interestingly, he came on for Juan Mata off the bench, meaning Van Persie, Rooney and Falcao were all on the pitch at the same time.

Rooney and Van Persie switched between dropping deep and supporting the 28-year-old, and it could be a system Van Gaal opts for in the future.

The Dutch boss used over 30 players in five competitive games, but he may well have found a team and system that sticks. Especially if Di Maria continues this form.
