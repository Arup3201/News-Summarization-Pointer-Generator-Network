A railway worker has found a way to ensure commuters leave for work on a high note each morning - by serenading them on the platform with songs made famous by his lookalike, the late opera singer Luciano Pavarotti.

Colin Miller, 61, can often be heard singing impromptu choruses of Nessun Dorma while passengers wait for their train to arrive.

The Virgin Trains station guard admits he cannot hold a tune like the famous singer, who performed to sell-out audiences across the globe.

But he boasts an impressive beard in the style of Pavarotti's, and passengers queue up to have their picture taken with him.

Some even hop off their train to be photographed with him before jumping back on before it leaves.

The former greengrocer started impersonating Pavarotti after the 1990 football World Cup, when the opera star's recording of Nessun Dorma was used as the theme song for the BBC's coverage of the tournament.

He travelled the world for a decade as a lookalike, earning up to £300 a time for appearances in locations as far afield as Sydney, Tokyo and Bangkok.

But the work dried up after the singer died in 2007, and Mr Miller was forced to get a new job at Lichfield Trent Valley station in Staffordshire.

Mr Miller, who is known as 'Pav' by colleagues and commuters, said: 'It’s a talking point for sure.

'They know I’m great with people and I’m not frightened to be in the public eye.

'I’ve had trains come in slowing down and I’ve had people get off to take my picture before jumping back on the train.

'We have impromptu little songs. I ask them if they know Nessun Dorma, they hum it and I sing it.

'I can’t sing like Pavarotti - but I give it a good go. All the punters love it.

'They know the railways don’t always run on time but people know I will be out there to keep them smiling.'

Commuter Polly Thompson, 26, who catches a train from the station to work each day, said: 'I see Colin most days and he really makes my morning.

'He just bursts into song and everybody gives him a little clap.

'It’s a good way to start your day - especially on a Monday morning when you don’t really want to go to work.'

Mr Miller’s lookalike career took off when his wife Mandy, 58, sent a photograph to an agent.

He has appeared in several TV commercials and adverts since, including one for soft drink Tizer which was featured on 1,500 buses across the country.

He still impersonates Pavarotti for charity, but he does his best to keep his work life separate from his family.

Mr Miller, who lives in Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, has promised not to mimic the singer when his daughter Jen, 26, marries her fiance Ben, 26, later this year.

He said: 'I’ve had to trim my beard and cut my hair short.

'I’m banned from singing at the wedding - she prefers Coldplay to opera - and it is her special day so I’m not arguing.'
