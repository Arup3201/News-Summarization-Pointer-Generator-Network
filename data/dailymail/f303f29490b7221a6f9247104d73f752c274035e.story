Starbucks is trying to play catch up to your favorite local cafe by offering 'cold brew' coffee, a hipper and less acidic alternative to normal iced coffee, to customers in Boston-area stores.

The Seattle-based giant became famous for introducing specialty coffee to a wider American audience as it expanded across the country, but on the coffee front the brewing behemoth has been outdone recently by smaller roasters and cafes.

According to the blog Starbucks Melody, the chain began 'quietly' serving a 'core Ethiopian' iced coffee prepared on the Toddy cold brew system in one area around Boston.

Be cool: Starbucks introduced cold brew coffee, a hip alternative to its normal iced coffee, to its stores with little fanfare

According to the system's instructions, preparing cold brew on the Toddy takes anywhere from 12 to 18 hours and produces a cup that's significantly less acidic than regular brewed coffee.

This method is different than the normal preparation technique for iced coffee, which is brewed hot before being chilled and served over ice.

GrubStreet states that cold brew is just one more way that Starbucks is 'inching into third-wave coffee,' the umbrella term for increased attention on brewing techniques and specialty coffee.

Starbucks introduced pour over techniques and Clover machines, both of which produce one cup of coffee at a time, in recent years.

Starbucks was beaten to the punch by a number of smaller-name coffee shops.

The blog Shot Zombies says that Portland-based Stumptown Coffee Roasters was selling cold brew in stores and released a bottled version as far back as 2010.

There shouldn't be any reason for Starbucks to panic over being behind: Forbes says sales at the Seattle chain are up.

Starbucks is preparing the cold brew in small daily batches, meaning that for locals need to hustle in for their fix before it sells out.
