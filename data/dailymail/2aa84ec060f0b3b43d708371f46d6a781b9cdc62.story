She admitted wearing Spanx beneath her dresses after developing a ‘paunch’ she couldn’t work off.

Amanda Holden has said that she has swapped spanks for yoga

But now Amanda Holden has stopped using the popular shape wear, because she has found that yoga works just as well.

Yesterday, the Britain’s Got Talent judge, 43, said embarking on a new fitness regime had helped tone her figure, rendering the tight-fitting underwear unnecessary.

Making her comments in a Radio Times interview she also admitted the talent show had restricted her acting career, while dismissing its rival The X Factor as ‘boring’.

And she revealed Jimmy Savile once offered to give her a ‘gynaecological problem’ – ‘completely out of order but I wasn’t traumatised’, while a comedian left her feeling ‘cheap and worthless’ when he ‘groped’ her.

Throwing away the Spanx marks an apparent boost in Miss Holden’s body confidence, for it is usually used by women who wish to hide certain parts of themselves.

Even slender stars are known to wear the tight-fitting pants, including Emma Watson whose Spanx could be seen beneath the thigh-split gown she wore to a premiere last week.

But revealing her decision to put hers in the bin, Miss Holden said: ‘I used to be a big fan of Spanx but ditched them two years ago when I started yoga, which has changed my shape.’

Adding of the teenage body hang-ups that she has finally managed to shake off, Miss Holden, who is now mother to her two daughters, Lexie, eight, and Hollie, two, said: ‘My best friend at school, Vic, had massive boobs and I wished I did.

‘I used to put everything down there – cotton wool, my dad’s socks, the kitchen sink – but now I’m 43 I’m happy because they’re still in the same position, more or less.’

Miss Holden’s comments come as the eighth series of Britain’s Got Talent approaches.

Next Saturday will see the start of the talent contest, with Miss Holden joining Simon Cowell, David Walliams and Alesha Dixon forming the judging panel.

She is the only judge – aside from creator Simon Cowell – to have remained on the panel for all of its eight series. 

But she admitted feeling stinted by the programme, because it restricts what she is offered as an actress.

‘In this country it seems you can only do one thing at a time,’ the former Wild at Heart star said. ‘I started in comedy with Simon Pegg and when I auditioned for drama they said, “She only does comedy”, and then I got drama and was never considered for comedy.

‘And because of BGT I’m now a presenter, which I love, but I’m considered too well known to act.’Worse than Britain’s Got Talent, however, would be to appear on rival talent contest The X Factor.

And Miss Holden said: ‘It’s a far better programme than The X Factor because we have more variety. It must be hard to judge singer after singer. But I don’t want to be told off by Simon for saying it’s boring. I’m a realist, though.’

For now, though, Miss Holden said she is happy to be a part of Britain’s Got Talent, because it means she can spend time with her daughters, and her second husband Chris Hughes, whom she married after divorcing Les Dennis.

‘If I was in America, I’d have my own show on the back of BGT because I’m bums on seats,’ she said. ‘It’s weird but works for me because I have my girls and if I did a drama I’d be away from home for 16 hours a day.’
