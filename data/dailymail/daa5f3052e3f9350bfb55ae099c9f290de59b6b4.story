George Groves has taken to the streets of London to help raise money for the Royal British Legion’s poppy appeal.

The super middleweight boxer has taken time out of his preparation for the fight against American Denis Douglin next month to collect money for the appeal.

He has also visited Buckingham Palace to meet Prince Harry and Downing Street to speak to the Prime Minister David Cameron.

And he has been on the #LondonPoppyAppeal bus to help raise awareness for the Royal British Legion.

Groves is on the comeback trail for a title fight after losing twice in a row – both epic battles – against Carl Froch.

Groves is set to take on American boxer Denis Douglin in his next fight in November

In the last fight, six months ago, he was knocked out by Froch in front of a sell-out crowd at Wembley.

But, as he prepares to take on Douglin, Groves has been joined by his strength and conditioning coach Barry O’Connell, an ex-Marine, in collecting money at Liverpool Street in London.
