When David Neeleman founded JetBlue airlines in 1999, he sought to ‘bring humanity back to travel’ with a classless seating structure.

But now the airline seems to be going against it’s mission by unveiling today the new 'Mint' class – a first-class section set to debut next year on flights between New York and Los Angeles and New York and San Francisco.

The  new section will feature lie-back seats, customized amentities kits and a tapas-style inflight menu in an attempt to attract a higher-paying clientele who wouldn't normally fly the budget airline cross-country.

But airline experts some question whether or not this move will alienate the company’s core customer.

‘This is seismic because now…JetBlue is saying some passengers are going to be more important that others,’ Henry Harteveldt, a travel analyst with Hudson Crossing, told USA Today. ‘This move is not one that comes with guaranteed success, nor is it one that comes without risk to the brand. There is a chance that some customers may look at this and say JetBlue is selling out.’

But the company defends it’s position to shake up the seating structure.

JetBlue CEO Dave Barger says Mint was
a response to the customers they were losing to American, United, Delta
and Virgin America – airlines that offer premium cabin experiences.

Coming soon: The move has come as a surprise to some industry experts, since the brand prides itself on treating passengers equally

Barger is confident the new class won’t be re-creating the brand since coach will be getting upgrades as well.

The first flight with the new Mint section will take off from John F Kennedy International Airport on June 15, 2014 en route to Los Angeles.

The new section will feature ‘suites’ with lie-flat suites which have their own door for privacy. The new seats will be the longest and widest on domestic flights. 

Before take-off, those in Mint will be offered a drink and once in the air, they can have a cocktail and hors d'oeuvre.

From there, passengers may choose to watch TV from their own personal 15-inch flatscreen, or perhaps take a nap. There’s a button they can press to notify flight attendants if they want to be awakened for a meal.

The meal itself will be a tapas-style menu, and passengers can choose from three of the five available plates.

Other features include an in-flight amenities box by Birchbox, with different boxes for male and female passengers. Products can be used in-flight, but some of the gifts are meant to be taken home like lotion and shampoo samples.

Perhaps to make up  for the massive upgrades in first-class, those flying in coach will also be getting an upgrade next year.

‘We wanted to make sure everyone on the airplane got an upgrade,’ said Martin St George, JetBlue’s senior vice president of marketing and commercial strategy. ‘We wanted to make sure our core customer didn’t think we were walking away from them.

Privacy: Mint passengers have their own door they can close for privacy and a button that signals flight attendants they want to be awakened for a meal

So coach will get a whole lot comfier with softer and roomier seats, even though the airline already offers more room in coach than any other domestic airline.

On the flights with the new Mint class, those in coach will be able to help themselves to a new self-service snack bar where they can get free soft drinks and munchies.

Other upgrades include power outlets at every seat, an increase from 36 to 100 channels of live TV, and free inflight WIFI.

While not every passenger will be equal on JetBlue flights next year, Jami Counter of SeatGuru  thinks customers will respond well to the improvements.

‘It’s certainly not a revolution. It’s only limited to these routes. I think they’re very aware of what they stand for and are very true to their brand, so in no way does this in my mind take away from the experience in the back.'
