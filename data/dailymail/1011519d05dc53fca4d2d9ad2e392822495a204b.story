Michael Jackson's burial was delayed for nearly three months due to wrangling between Janet Jackson and her brother's estate, it was reported today.

Details of the row are revealed in a new biography of the star by Rolling Stone writer Randall Sullivan.

According to Sullivan, Janet put up the 
$40,000 deposit at Forest Lawn to secure a spot for Michael but refused 
to let the funeral take place until the money was repaid.

The claims are made in an excerpt of the biography Untouchable and published in November's Vanity Fair.

Sullivan reports that Michael's mother Katherine Jackson also arrived that night and entered the house, where she telephoned Grace Rwaramba, the recently terminated longtime nanny to Michael's children.

The book says that according to Rwaramba, Katherine said: 'Grace, the children are crying. They are asking about you.

'They can't believe that their father died. Grace, you remember Michael used to hide cash at the house? I'm here. Where can it be?'

Rwaramba described Michael's standard practice of hiding his cash in black plastic garbage bags and under the carpets.

Talon describes seeing La Toya and her boyfriend loading black plastic garbage bags into duffel bags and placing them in the garage.

However, Vanity Fair reports, La Toya insists that nearly all of Michael's money was gone by the time she arrived at the Holmby Hills house.

The next morning, Janet Jackson arrived with a moving van and demanded to be admitted and few hours later, the truck exited through the front gate with Jeffre Phillips at the wheel.

Katherine Jackson and her daughters made it clear that they wouldn't be leaving anytime soon.

'They camped out for most of a week,' Williams tells Sullivan, leaving and returning 'whenever they felt like it.'

Documents showed the family spent more than £22,000 on Jackson's burial outfit and usher costumes.

More than £2,000 was spent on framing a photograph of Jackson next to the casket, and £7,000 on invitations and programmes.

Guests enjoyed more than £12,000 worth of food and drink, detailed as 'funeral repast' after the ceremony.

Flowers cost almost £10,000, cars more than £18,000 and a 'funeral designer' £9,000.

More than £516,000 went on cemetery and funeral charges, including the purchase of other plots in the mausoleum that houses Jackson.

Court documents reveal that the family had received a warning from undertakers that unless payment was received swiftly the funeral would be unable to proceed.

Lawyers for the singer's mother Katherine requested money from the estate, insisting that cancelling would cause the family 'public embarrassment and added grief'.

They added: 'Mrs Jackson and her family wish to honour her son by a funeral that seeks to offer solace to his multitude of fans and by which the family also may be comforted.'

It was also claimed that the costs were 'entirely commensurate with the deceased's worldwide status as an entertainer'.

Jackson died in June 2009 after a cardiac arrest brought on by an overdose of prescription drugs. He had a large public tribute at the Staples Center in Los Angeles the following month.

The family funeral was on September 2, 2009.
