Pope Benedict XVI used his Christmas Day address to call for an end to bloody conflicts in Syria and Palestine and for there to be peace in the middle East.

Appearing from the balcony of the Vatican, he spoke to thousands of pilgrims, tourists and locals who gathered in St Peter's square.

In his traditional 'Urbi et Orbi' speech, the Pope condemned the killing of 'defenceless' civilians in Syria and urged Palestine and Israel to find the courage to negotiate.

Benedict also encouraged Arab spring nations, especially Egypt, to build just and respectful societies.

He said Egypt was the land 'blessed by the childhood of Jesus' also prayed that China's new leaders respect religion, a reference to persecution Chinese Roman Catholics have at times endured under communism.

Last night Benedict led a two-hour Christmas Eve ceremony in the basilica in which he questioned if there is still time for God in our technology-driven lives.

In his 'Urbi et Orbi' speech, which 
traditionally reviews world events and global challenges, Benedict 
prayed that 'peace spring up for the people of Syria, deeply wounded and
 divided by a conflict that does not spare even the defenceless and 
reaps innocent victims'.

He called for easier access to help refugees and for 'dialogue in the pursuit of a political solution to the conflict'.

Benedict prayed that God 'grant 
Israelis and Palestinians courage to end long years of conflict and 
division, and to embark resolutely on the path to negotiation'.

Senior Palestinian official Saeb 
Erekat said that in a meeting with the Pope last week, Palestinian 
president Mahmoud Abbas 'emphasised our total readiness to resume 
negotiations'.

The Vatican has been worried for 
decades about the well-being of its flock in China, who are loyal to the
 Pope in defiance of the communist government's support of an 
officially-sponsored church, and relations between Beijing and the Holy 
See are often tense.

Speaking about China's 
newly-installed leaders, Benedict expressed hope that 'they will esteem 
the contribution of the religions, in respect for each other, in such a 
way that they can help to build a fraternal society for the benefit of 
that noble people and of the whole world'.

Acknowledging Latin America's 
predominant Christian population, he urged government leaders to carry 
out commitments to development and to fighting organised crime.

Calling for unity: Pope Benedict XVI also prayed that Israelis and Palestinians live in peace and freedom, and asked the faithful to pray for strife-torn Syria as well as Lebanon and Iraq

Christmas Eve Mass at the Vatican traditionally began at midnight, but the start time was moved up years ago so as to give the 85-year-old pontiff more time to rest before his Christmas Day speech.

A smiling Benedict, dressed in gold-coloured vestments, waved to photo-snapping pilgrims and applauding church-goers as he glided up the centre aisle toward the ornate main altar of the cavernous basilica on a wheeled platform guided by white-gloved aides. The platform saves him energy.

In his homily last night, Benedict cited the Gospel account of Mary and Joseph finding no room at an inn and ending up in a stable which sheltered the baby Jesus. He urged people to reflect upon what they find time for in their busy, technology-driven lives.

'The great moral question of our attitude toward the homeless, toward refugees and migrants takes on a deeper dimension: Do we really have room for God when he seeks to enter under our roof? Do we have time and space for him?' the pope said.

'The faster we can move, the more efficient our time-saving appliances become, the less time we have. And God? The question of God never seems urgent,' Benedict lamented.

The pope worried that 'we are so 'full' of ourselves that there is no room left for God'. He added 'that means there is no room for others either - for children, for the poor, for the stranger'.

With his voice a bit hoarse, and looking somewhat tired as the two-hour ceremony neared its end, Benedict decried that history has suffered through 'misuse of religion', when belief in one God became a pretext for intolerance and violence.

Still, he insisted that where God is 'forgotten or even denied, there is no peace either'.

'Let us pray that Israelis and Palestinians be able to live their lives in the peace of the one God and in freedom,' the pope said.

Benedict also mentioned his hope for progress in Syria, which is mired in civil war, as well as Lebanon and Iraq.

Reflecting the Vatican's concern about the exodus of many fearful Christians from the Muslim-dominated Middle East, Benedict expressed hope that 'Christians in those lands where our faith was born maybe be able to continue living there' and that Christians and Muslims 'build up their countries side by side in God's peace'.

Hours before the basilica Mass, Benedict lit a Christmas peace candle on the windowsill of his studio window overlooking St Peter's Square.
