Maria Sharapova reached her third successive French Open final by battling past Eugenie Bouchard.

Sharapova maintained her remarkable record in three-set matches by winning an 18th consecutive deciding set on clay in a 4-6, 7-5, 6-2 victory.

The Russian won her first title at Roland Garros in 2012 before losing to Serena Williams 12 months ago.

Rising star: Eugenie Bouchard, 20, was playing in her second consecutive Grand Slam semi-final

Bouchard, 
who was playing in her second straight grand slam semi-final, had lost 
comfortably to Sharapova in the second round last year and demonstrated 
again the huge strides she has made.

She possesses the same steely-eyed determination as Sharapova and her mental strength is remarkable for a 20-year-old.

The
 Canadian said after beating Angelique Kerber in the fourth round that 
she did not have a best friend in tennis, adding: 'I don't think the 
tennis tour is the place to have friends. For me, it's all competition.'

It
 was a sentence that could well have been written by Sharapova so it was
 no surprise that this was not a match for the faint-hearted.

Bouchard
 has improved significantly since making the last four at the Australian
 Open in January, hitting the ball a lot more aggressively, and it was 
she who struck first with a break for 2-1.

Sharapova
 fought back to level at 4-4 but Bouchard forged ahead again immediately
 and held to take the set, saving a break point with the gutsiest of 
backhand winners onto the line.

Sharapova
 had recovered from a set down in both her last two matches against Sam 
Stosur and Garbine Muguruza and set about doing the same, moving into a 
5-2 lead.

But
 the Russian's serve, never something to be relied upon, was having an 
off day and, serving for the set, she twice double-faulted on set point.

There was also a second-serve ace on a break point for good measure but on her third chance Bouchard pounced.

The
 20-year-old was unable to resist when Sharapova broke again at 5-5, 
though, and this time the seventh seed clinched the set when Bouchard 
netted a forehand.

Bouchard
 had never lost a grand slam match in which she had won the first set 
before but the sense was Sharapova's prowess in deciding sets would be 
the crucial factor.

The Russian moved ahead at 3-1, and for the first time Bouchard was making bad mistakes on the big points.

She
 held for 4-2, saving two break points, but in the next game missed a 
routine forehand and a volley as Sharapova moved to within one game of 
victory.

Bouchard
 fought on, saving four match points in terrific style, but there was 
nothing she could do when a Sharapova forehand fizzed off the baseline 
after two hours and 27 minutes.
