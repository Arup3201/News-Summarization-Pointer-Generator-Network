Last week she was rocking a tuxedo in DKNY's menswear campaign, but this week Cara the chameleon is lending her good looks to YSL's super feminine beauty campaign.

The supermodel, who has long been the face of the French beauty giant, showcases the effects of its new Luxurious Mascara in the campaign imagery and behind the scenes video.

The 22-year-old British model has also created a bespoke mascara etched with her signature and heart for her avid fans.

British supermodel Cara Delevingne has been unveiled as the face of YSL's new mascara campaign 

The new mascara is designed to create lashes that look 'extremely long and voluminous - subtle yet audacious' and Cara shows off the new product to perfection.

On Tuesday night, the star helped launch the product in London's Selfridges. 

Wearing an all-black ensemble, the catwalk star pulled various funny faces as she represented the popular brand.

Cara's latest fashion campaign was for DKNY, another brand she has a long-standing affiliation with - and even designed her own range for.

She looks stylish in an androgynous suit teamed with her signature sneakers as she poses in the high-fashion shoot alongside male models Ben Nordberg, Jackson Hale and Sang Woo Kim.

Proving her worth, Cara also lends her good looks to the womenswear campaign.

The 22-year-old leads the female pack alongside Binx Walton, Xiao Wen Ju, and Sam Rollinson.

Cara has been keeping busy and recently attended a string of glitzy showbiz parties over in Los Angeles, where she's been hanging out with her best friend Kendall Jenner.

She is getting set to star in some Hollywood blockbusters this year as she makes the foray from modelling to acting.
