A six-year-old public schoolgirl has died from head injuries after a mantelpiece collapsed in the family home.

Ambulance crews and medics were unable to save Isabella Pritchard - known as Bella - after being called to the house in Burkes Road, Beaconsfield on the afternoon of Saturday July 7, just days before the end of the school year.

Bella, who attended the £10,275 a year Maltman's Green School for Girls in Gerrards Cross, was rushed to Wexham Park Hospital where she was later pronounced dead.

Her family are being supported by police family liaison officers and have asked for privacy.

Thames Valley Police said the incident is not being treated as suspicious and are continuing their investigations into the tragedy. An inquest was opened on Thursday July 12.

Det Insp Sharon Hill, from Amersham CID, said: 'This is a tragic incident and our thoughts are with Bella’s family who have been receiving specialist support from a family liaison officer.

'We continue to investigate the circumstances of her death and are working with our partners at Buckinghamshire County Council and Trading Standards.'

Bella's classmates wore her favourite colour pink in the last week of term in tribute to the 'very special girl' who had an 'infectious love of life'.

Joanna Pardon, headmistress of the school, said: ‘Everyone at Maltman’s Green School was in shock over the last few days of term after hearing the news of Bella’s tragic death.

‘She will be remembered for her wonderful smile, her laughter and her deeply caring gentle nature.’
