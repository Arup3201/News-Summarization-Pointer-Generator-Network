Tragedy: Aaron Dugmore, nine, was found hanged after he was sent to his room following an argument with his younger brother, an inquest heard

A nine-year-old boy was found hanged after he was sent to his room following an argument with his younger brother, an inquest heard.

Aaron Dugmore was found by his 16-year-old older brother in his bedroom in Erdington, Birmingham on February 12, last year and although he was taken to hospital he died the following day.

A coroner today ruled that Aaron's death had been an accident, as she could not be sure if the the schoolboy had intended to kill himself, and he was too young to know what he was doing.

At the time of his death, Aaron's mother Kelly-Marie Dugmore, 30, and stepfather Paul Jones, 43, said he had been teased for being white by Asian bullies at school.

However an inquest at Birmingham Coroners Court heard today that police had found no evidence of any bullying at Erdington Hall Primary School, Birmingham, where Aaron had recently started.

The hearing was told that on the night he died, Aaron had argued and kicked his younger brother, before being sent to his room.

Giving evidence, Ms Dugmore told the court of the circumstances leading up to Aaron's death.

'I collected him from school at 3.20pm,' she said.

'When
 I arrived he had a bit of an argument with another boy at the school, 
there was a bit of pushing and shoving and I called him away.

'We went home and he was just not happy, he had not been happy since he had been at that school any way.

'He asked if he could have some sweets and I said I didn't have any change and he could have some after tea.

'When we got home he asked me if he could go and play outside, but I said he couldn't, it was snowy and cold.

'He wasn't happy, he argued with (his younger brother) and kicked him in the leg, I told him to go upstairs to calm down.

'I carried on making tea, I was making his favourite. His brother went upstairs to check on him and said he was asleep.

'I
 gave the other children their tea and then send (his older brother) to get him, I 
didn't want him sleeping now and staying up all night and causing 
trouble at school.

'(The brother) went upstairs and I could hear him screaming "what have you done"?.'

Ms Dugmore said she had initially thought Aaron had messed up his room, or broken his phone, but when she went upstairs she discovered what had really happened.

'I was trying to get breath into him and we were waiting for the ambulance to come,' she said.

'He had never mentioned harming himself before, you never think a nine year old child would know about that.

'I considered that maybe one of the children at the school told him to do something.'

Dr Nicholas Hunt, a forensic surgeon 
told the court Aaron had died of a hypoxic-ischemic brain injury at 
Birmingham Children's Hospital.

'We were given evidence that he suffered from learning difficulties.' he said.

'There were no signs of natural illness that may have contributed to his death.'

At
 the time of Aaron's death Ms Dugmore had raised suspicions that her son
 had been bullied, and that it made her 'feel sick to my stomach'.

His family also said Aaron had been threatened with a plastic knife by one Asian pupil - who warned him: 'Next time it will be a real one.'

Parents: The coroner said that Aaron's mother Kelly-Marie Dugmore, 30, (left) and stepfather Paul Jones, 43, (right) had done all they could to save Aaron

However, Detective
 Inspector Richard Scott, from West Midlands Police, told the hearing that an 
investigation into Aaron's death had found no suspicious circumstances, and no evidence of bullying.

'We carried out videoed interviews with the family and everyone was consistent with their account,' he said.

'We visited the school and there were some reports of a number of incidents with different individuals.

'But our investigation found they were dealt with appropriately and there was no evident of systematic bullying.'

According
 to staff at the school, where 75 per cent of pupils come from ethnic 
minority backgrounds. he had already 'settled in quickly' with his 
classmates after joining the previous September.

The school, which caters for 450 pupils aged three to 11, received an 'inadequate' rating by Ofsted inspectors last year.

Coroner
 for Birmingham and Solihull Louise Hunt said she could not be sure 
Aaron had meant to kill himself - because he was too young to know what 
he was doing.

Recording a verdict of accidental death, she said: 'His mother and step father tried everything they could.

Probe: Police found no evidence of any bullying at Erdington Hall Primary School, Birmingham, where Aaron had recently started

'That must have been difficult I give you call credit for what you tried to do.

'Birmingham Children's Hospital managed to successfully resuscitate him, probably as a result of the actions you took.

'By that time it was already confirmed there was damaged due to oxygen starvation.

'In order to consider suicide I have to be sure he meant to take his own life.

'I am not sure of those facts. It seems to me a boy I that age could not know the consequence of his actions.

'A verdict of accidental death would be suitable.'

Addressing Aaron's parents, she added: 'His death was a tragedy, it is clear to see what effect it has had on you.'

Speaking after the today's hearing, a spokeswoman for West Midlands Police said: 'Following Aaron's death, police carried out a thorough investigation and took a number of statements from the school but no evidence of any bullying was found.'

Jane Held, Independent Chair of Birmingham's Safeguarding Board, said: 'This was a tragedy for Aaron and his family.

'Our heartfelt sympathies go to his family and all who knew him.

'Whilst the Board has nearly completed a Serious Case Review we are waiting for the details from the inquest before completing it as we could not pre-empt the Coroner's findings.

'After completion, we will share the report with Aaron's family and will consider how best to use the findings to help other children and families so they don't have to face a similar tragedy.'
