After Andrew Flintoff's brief return in Brisbane, England enlisted the help of another familiar face in Hobart.

Yorkshire bowler Tim Bresnan has been in the Tasmanian capital playing for Big Bash franchise Hobart Hurricanes and was invited to link up with the World Cup squad at their latest training session.

The 29-year-old, who last played for England last March during the World Twenty20, was on hand to take part in fielding drills and send down a few overs of bustling medium-pace in the nets.

Bresnan may also have been able to pass on some local knowledge about the Bellerive Oval pitch, just as Flintoff was invited to do when England played at the Gabba - home of the all-rounder's Brisbane Heat side.

But while Flintoff is well and truly part of England's past, Bresnan still harbours hopes of a recall.

An experienced player in all three formats, Bresnan has fallen down the pecking order since undergoing surgery on an elbow injury.

But with a packed 2015 schedule only just beginning, he will have been hopeful of making an impression on head coach Peter Moores, who has yet to select him since returning to the job.
