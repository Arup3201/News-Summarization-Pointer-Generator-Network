When Hugh Hefner and his bevy of bunny girls arrived at Heathrow in 1966, he was ready with his trusty camera.

He was there too when Christine Keeler - just released from prison after the Profumo scandal - lay seductively in a meadow; and again when a young Prince Charles indulged in a spot of waterskiing while sitting on a chair.

Now, the archive of Ray Bellisario, who was dubbed London's first paparazzo, has gone up for auction.

It is a remarkable body of work, spanning the 1950s to 70s, and captures subjects ranging from the Royals to the Belfast riots, as well as celebrities including Brigitte Bardot... and Sammy the waterskiing dog.

Celebrity photographer Ray Bellisario took this image of Christine Keeler soon after her release from prison in 1964 following the Profumo scandal which brought down the Macmillan government

While many of the 20,000 transparencies on sale are of the House of Windsor, the photographer was so loathed by them that Prince Philip suggested sending him to the Tower.

'That bloody Bellisario!’, as Princess Margaret used to 
call him, was a constant presence at royal events, taking candid shots of the Queen and her family.

Some of the 'Royal collection' were featured in Bellisario's 1972 book To Tread On Royal Toes and also in international media, yet there are many which are previously unseen.

The sale of the catalogue, including its copyright, has been organised by Omega Auctions of Cheshire.

Auctioneer Paul Fairweather said: 'This is a remarkable collection and we expect there will be significant interest not only in the UK but worldwide. It is such a unique collection with nothing ever having come up for sale previously to compare it to.

‘We expect the collection to achieve somewhere in the region of between £500,000 and £1million.’

Ray Bellisario was born in 1936 to Italian immigrant parents, the youngest of a family of 11.

His parents eked out a living selling ice cream from a hand-cart along the cobbled streets of the Yorkshire mining town of Pontefract.

From these humble beginnings emerged the man who later became internationally known as the 'Hammer of The House of Windsor'.

It was the year the young Queen was 
crowned - 1954 - that the 18-year-old novice photographer took a picture of her sheltering 
under an umbrella that was published by several newspapers.

Bellisario
realised he was onto something and decided to concentrate his efforts 
on the Royal Family, but seek something different from the rest of the 
press pack.

‘It was a business decision, nothing more, nothing less,’ he told the Daily Mail from his home in Spain.

‘I used a mixture of commonsense and contacts. Of course I got tip-offs, but I also thought about things very laterally.’

Now aged 77, Bellisario has donated his entire archives to the charity he has founded called Reach For Rights and all of his proceeds for the sale of the collection will go to the charity.

Some of his photographs, such as the one of Prince Charles sitting on a chair while waterskiing on the lake at Sunninghill Park, Windsor, show a fun side to the royals, rarely seen in public.

Bellisario was standing on a footpath by the lake when he was approached by Princess Margaret’s then husband, Lord Snowdon, who told him: ‘If you hang on we’ll do something that will really make your pictures. Keep an eye out for the chair!’

Soon, Prince Charles came whizzing past, sitting on an old chair which had been balanced on an upturned table, with grinning Snowdon at the wheel of the speedboat.

Eventually, however, Bellisario tired of his fights with the royals and went abroad, earning plaudits for his work covering conflicts in Northern Ireland, the Western Sahara and the Nigerian Civil War.

His work inspired him to set up Reach For Rights. The auction will fund its work providing a free legal service for those without the means to seek help, including the disabled and victims of domestic violence.

He says: ‘I am sad to be relinquishing my collection, much of which has not been seen in public before, but it is in aid of cause about which I am passionate and will, I hope, live long after I am gone.

‘For the past 40 years it has been secretly moved from place to place and whoever buys it will be securing a piece of history.'
