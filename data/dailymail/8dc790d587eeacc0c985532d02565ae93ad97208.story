Hot wings: A pigeon has been blamed for setting a block of flats on fire after picking up a smouldering cigarette and dropping a into a rooftop birds nest (file photo)

A pigeon has been blamed for setting a block of flats alight after picking up a discarded smouldering cigarette and dropping it into a birds nest hidden inside the roof.

Nine people were evacuated when the three-storey building caught fire in Stockwell, south London, with neighbours calling 999 after spotting smoke billowing from the roof.

Four fire engines carrying 21 firefighters rushed to the scene, and although the crews were able to put out the flames they struggled to find the cause of the blaze.

'When we got up into the roof, we were baffled as there were no obvious ignition sources,' said London Fire Brigade investigations officer Matt Cullen.

'No-one had been up to there for a long time and there were no electrics that could have sparked a blaze.'

'We looked everywhere, but the smoking gun was found when we discovered a partially burnt birdsâ€™ nest.

'Neighbours told us they often saw birds flying in and out of a hole in the roof.

'We believe that one of the birds picked up a cigarette butt that was still smouldering and dropped it into the nest, causing it to catch fire and set the roof alight.'

Fire crews were called to the block just 
after 10.20pm last night and although the roof was damaged by flames, no
 one was hurt.

The nine occupants were able to flee the building, containing three flats above a shop, before rescue workers arrived.

Evacuated: Among those evacuated was grandmother Ellen Monger, 60, who was ironing in her front room when she realised she could smell smoke

Among those evacuated was grandmother Ellen Monger, 60, who was ironing in her front room when she realised she could smell smoke.

She looked into her grandson Dylan Dixson's room, where the eight-year-old was asleep.

But a neighbour began banging on her door, warning about the flames.

'I grabbed Dylan and just got out of there,' said Ms Monger.

'I didn't stop for one second - my friend from across the way was there screaming "fire."

'It was scary, I've never experienced anything like it.

Fire tore through the loft space above the top floor flat, damaging the roof and ceiling below

The ceiling has now collapsed in on the bedrooms, littering Ms Monger's home with wet ash and debris

Ms Monger said her bedrooms are completely gutted now, and the whole flat is smoke-damaged

'The
 fire brigade were there within minutes and they did a fantastic job 
putting out the fire. I couldn't believe it when they told me it was 
started by a bird dropping a lit cigarette.

'I don't know where it got it from, but it certainly wasn't me. I don't even smoke.'

She said: 'The bedrooms are completely gutted now, and the whole flat is smoke-damaged.

'I have got a skylight now I never had before. I suppose it would make a nice addition, but I'd rather have a functioning roof.

Blaze: Nine people were evacuated when the three-storey building caught fire in Stockwell, south London, with neighbours calling 999 after spotting smoke billowing from the roof

Smoking gun: Firefighters managed to put out the blaze but struggled to find the cause - until they discovered a charred nest on the roof of the block of flats

'There's
 water and ash everywhere - I only really kept Christmas decorations in 
the loft, but I've lost them all now, as well as a few other possessions
 that have been burnt, soaked, crushed or all three.

'It could be worse though. You can replace things, not people. I'm so happy my grandson was unharmed.

'If the ceiling had collapsed while he was in bed, I think he would have been a goner.'

'The incident is a great example of why itâ€™s important to put your cigarettes out fully - you never know what might become of your smouldering butts,' said Mr Cullen.

'Luckily for the residents, their neighbours saw the smoke and raised the alarm, so fire crews could get in quickly and bring it under control.'

London Fire Brigade believes that a separate fire last year was caused by a pigeon dropping a cigarette down a chimney, while another 2013 blaze was started when dog accidentally turned on
 a toaster.

In January 2007 a pigeon was blamed for a fire which destroyed an office building in Huntington, West Virginia, after fire investigators found a huge, five-foot wide nest, lined with dozens of cigarette butts in the building's attic.
