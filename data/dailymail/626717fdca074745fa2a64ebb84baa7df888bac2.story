Essex chef Jamie Oliver could have competition on his hands. 

Two of TOWIE's hottest stars have taken to the kitchen in an attempt to impress mystery dates by cooking them dinner.

Reality TV's Tom Pearce and James ‘Diags’ Bennewith grapple with knives and flip pans with ease in the footage, getting hot and bothered as they cook up a storm.

Messy attempt: Diags starts to layer his tortillas with the mince and vegetable mixture 

Armed with a recipe for lamb keema tortilla stacks, the lads, who left The Only Way Is Essex last year, competed against each other to make the best version of the dish. 

In the video filmed for a campaign for LambSoc, the online community for English Beef and Lamb, 23-year-old Tom is clearly the more experienced chef of the two as his pal Diags seems to struggle with the simple task of dicing an onion.

But both lads can't stop the tears streaming from their eyes as they take their knives to the allium. 

'Hahaha, you're crying,' Diags, 23, cheekily points out as Tom's eyes start streaming.

Blinded by tears, the pair continue to gamely dice onion, chop chilli and peel garlic. 

A one point it looks as though Diags is in danger of losing a finger after a particularly risky knife move by Tom. 

'What are you doing?' he exclaims as Tom narrowly misses his digits. 'My fingers are there mate.'

The dynamic kitchen duo then gently fry the raw ingredients in the pan, with Tom tossing the cooked ingredients as Diags adds generous spoonfuls of cumin and garam masala to the mixture. 

'Mate, that's too much', Tom reprimands but Diags insists that he's following the recipe to the letter. 

Adding lamb mince to the pan, the boys take it in turns to stir, mixing in fresh herbs and tomatoes to the mixture.

'Look how juicy it's got all of a sudden,' Tom says as he stirs the mixture in the pan. 

It's good,' he says, as he tastes the mixture while Diags complains that it could be too spicy.

Diags and Tom dish up their respective tortilla stacks to their mystery dates

The competition kicks up a notch when it's time to assemble the tortilla stacks.

Tom's precise stacking skills come to the fore as he carefully spreads his keema on the tortilla before sprinkling on the cheese.

'Tortilla down,' he says, placing it on the baking tray. He then spreads the mince before laying another pancake on the top.

'The trick to this is not to put too much filling,' Diags advises as Tom carefully lays another pancake on his pile before starting the the process again.

But he then proceeds to ignore his own advice and starts piling the mince onto his tortilla .

Bits of meat spill out of the sides and he has to use his fingers to pat them back into their floury casing. 

'You have to massage the meat like you massage a lady,' Tom says, as he shows off his perfect tortilla stack.

When it comes to garnishes and decoration, Tom opts for peas while Diags places a whole de-seeded chilli on his stack. 

They then put their creation in the oven, just in the nick of time as the mystery girls arrive for dinner.

Presenting their respective offerings to their dates, Tom's presentation gets the thumbs up from both women, with special mention given to the peas.

'The peas look great; they're a bit more creative,' they say. 

Tasting their dinner, the women, who seem visibly surprised give it thumbs up, praising the 'rustic' taste and look of the meal.

Lamb tortilla stacks 

To make the lamb keema

Ingredients: 450G lean lamb mince; two teaspoons sunflower or vegetable oil; one large onion, peeled and finely chopped; two garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped or crushed; one inch piece fresh root ginger, peeled and finely chopped; one or two 1-2 green chillies, deseeded (if preferred) and finely chopped; two teaspoons ground cumin; three tablespoons garam masala or medium curry powder; four medium tomatoes, chopped; one or two teaspoons white sugar; two tablespoons tomato purée; salt and freshly milled black pepper; 100g fresh or frozen peas; large handful freshly chopped coriander, to garnish

Method: Heat the oil in a large non-stick frying pan and cook the onion and garlic over a low heat for 10 minutes or until soft and lightly golden. Add the ginger, chillies, cumin and garam masala or curry powder. Cook over a moderate heat for 1-2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the lamb and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes, then add the tomatoes, sugar, tomato purée and bring to the boil. Season, reduce the heat and gently simmer uncovered for 20-25 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add a little water, if needed. 10 minutes before the end of the cooking time add the peas.

To make the stacks

Ingredients: Four to six corn or flour tortillas;100g grated mild hard cheese such as cheddar

Method: Preheat the oven to Gas mark 6/200°C/400°F. Place a tortilla on a large non-stick baking tray and spoon over a portion of the mince mixture evenly and a handful of cheese. Repeat with the remaining ingredients finishing with the cheese. Bake in the oven for 10 minutes, or until the cheese melts. Cut into equal portions and serve with salad. Tip: If preferred scatter some baby spinach on top of each keema layer.
