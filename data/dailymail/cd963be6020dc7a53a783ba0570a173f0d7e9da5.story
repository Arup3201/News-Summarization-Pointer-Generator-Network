Celtic have joined the clutch of clubs who will consider taking Steven Gerrard on loan next January.

The Liverpool captain is joining LA Galaxy in the summer but, fitness permitting, will explore loan options in their off-season.

Gerrard has already indicated that he will maintain fitness by training at Liverpool and the club will consider whether to offer him a loan period themselves.

Steven Gerrard, training with Liverpool on Saturday, could go on loan in January with Celtic showing interest

Gerrard does not wish to play against Liverpool so failing their interest he will look at options outside of England.

Real Sociedad may also come forward should David Moyes remain in Spain. 

The former Manchester United boss is a big admirer of Gerrard and was interested In signing the 34-year old before he agreed to sign for the Galaxy.

Celtic will struggle to match Gerrard's wages but hope a compromise could be reached if necessary.
