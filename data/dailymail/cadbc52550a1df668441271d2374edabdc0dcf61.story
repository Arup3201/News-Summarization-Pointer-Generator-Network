Karen Livingstone is one strong woman. 

She's lost her mother, father and husband to cancer but is more determined than ever to continue her advocacy work to push for further medical research in Australia.

Yet the pain is still raw for the Melbourne mother-of-two, who as of Wednesday has been the recipient of The Advocacy Award from the annual Research Australia Awards, as she still continues to cope with her loss.

Ms Livingstone's journey began in 1997 when she learnt that her mother Elsie had been diagnosed with ovarian cancer.

Devastated by the news, Ms Livingstone and her sister Nicole dealt with their grief by pouring all their energy into creating an organisation that might one day prevent other families from feeling the same sense of loss. 

'We thought mum was okay because she had a partial hysterectomy so when we were told she had ovarian cancer, it had a detrimental effect on our family,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'When you've lost someone in your life, you try and make sense of it and we did this by setting up Ovarian Cancer Australia. 

'We didn't want other families to feel robbed, just like we had been.'

Her mother lost her battle in 2001, the year Ms Livingstone officially co-founded the organisation with her sister. 

The 49-year-old dedicated her time into building a support network for cancer victims, their families and also establishing a national day to raise awareness of ovarian cancer.

But in 2009 Ms Livingstone's world came crashing down, yet again. 

Her husband, Dave Grant, had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.

Ms Livingstone says her husband's death took a massive toll on her two children who were very young at the time of his passing

'I literally fell on the ground when I found out,' she said.

'How do you explain to your 9-year-old-son and 13-year-old daughter that their dad has a five per cent chance of survival?'

At the time she was the CEO of her organisation but made the decision to step down from her role to care for her ill husband, who died in 2010.

An immense sense of loss was also felt by her two children Madeleine and Spencer, who are now 18 and 15.

'My husband was only 52 when he died and my daughter was his princess and my son was just figuring out what his dad was all about,' Ms Livingstone said.

'Our children had to watch every day as their father grew weak and skeletal. There was no hiding from pancreatic cancer.

'The suffering for our family didn't end there. The grief and loss felt by our children has been so extensive, four years on they still don't understand.'

Since then, Ms Livingstone tirelessly continued her efforts into volunteering for the Garvan Research Foundation to underline the importance of consumer involvement in the medical research process.

She's also become a board member of Australian New Zealand Gynaecological Oncology Group (ANZGOG) to be part of the process of medical research and ensure better outcomes for women going through treatment.

But most recently, in October, Ms Livingstone's lost her father Ed to prostate cancer.

'Dad was an integral part of my life and my children's lives especially after Dave died,' she said.

'My father was an amazing person and very protective of us. It was a difficult loss.'

Having suffered a triple tragedy, the award recipient has no intention of slowing down her advocacy work - even after being honoured at the annual Research Australia Awards on Wednesday night.

But she's adamant that she's still, after all, human and is still quite evidently dealing with her loss of her three loved ones.

'How do you cope with so much loss unless you know it's not been in vain?' she said.

'I've lost my mum, my husband and my father. All I can do is look forward and continue to make sure that cancer research stays relevant.'

Ms Livingstone hopes to see a change in the medical world, which will make a difference to future cancer victims and their families.

'I don't want to see men and women being struck down by the disease - emotionally and physically,' she said. 

'If we have the right support, cancer diagnosis doesn't have to be a death sentence.'

Ms Livingstone was recognised for her advocacy efforts in the ovarian, gynaecological and pancreatic cancer research last night and was 'absolutely thrilled to have won the award'.

'I believe that consumers have a strong voice in research to benefit future generations,' she said.
