Former NBA star Charles Barkley has come to the defense of Adrian Peterson just days after the disgraced football player was indicted on charges of child abuse, claiming every black parent in the South whips their child.

Appearing on NFL Today this Sunday, Barkley said, 'Whipping – we do that all the time. Every black parent in the South is going to be in jail under those circumstances.'

He then stated that he believes there is a fine line between spanking and child abuse.

Supporter: Charles Barkley is excusing the behavior of Adrian Peterson by claiming 'every black parent in the South whips their child'

Indicted: Peterson, who was sidelined by the Minnesota Vikings this Sunday, has been charged with reckless or negligent injury to a child

Victim: Peterson hit his son with a leafless branch, or switch, in May of this year, leaving the four-year-old with open wounds and bruises (above)

A Houston grand jury indicted Peterson on Friday for reckless or negligent injury to a child, concluding that his use of a leafless tree branch, or switch, to repeatedly hit his son back in May was 'unreasonable discipline.'

The four-year-old was left with numerous bruises and open wounds following the incident, which were documented with photographs.

Barkley is claiming however that he believes this to be perfectly acceptable, and he went through much the same when he was a child.

'I’ve had many welts on my legs. I’ve gotten beat with switches – and I don’t even like the term,' Barkley stated. 

'When the media talks about it, ‘beating a child,’ … we called it "spanking" or "whipping" our kids.'

He then added, 'I think we have to really be careful trying to teach other parents how to discipline their kids. That’s a very fine line.'

Peterson, who flew to Houston to turn himself in late Friday night,  was sidelined by the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday in the wake of this indictment, as the team lost to the New England Patriots 30 - 7.

That decision is being applauded by former Viking, and current ESPN analyst, Cris Carter, who this weekend emotionally recounted his own experiences with abuse as a young child at the hands of his mother.

'The only thing I’m proud about is the team that I played for, they did the right thing.' he said while appearing on NFL Countdown this Sunday.

Peterson faces up to two years in prison and a $10,000 fine if found guilty. 

He will return to play next weekend it was announced earlier today, when the Vikings take on the New Orleans Saints.
