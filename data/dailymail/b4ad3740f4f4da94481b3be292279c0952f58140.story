Charged: Tracey Lynn Garner pleaded not guilty Tuesday, June 18, 2013, to killing an Alabama woman by giving silicone injections as a buttocks enhancement

A 'fake' doctor in the U.S. has pleaded not guilty to a second murder charge for the death of a woman following buttock-enhancing injections.

Tracey Lynn Garner, from Jackson, Mississippi, has been arrested and charged with one count of depraved heart murder of an Alabama woman, which means she had a callous disregard for the life of her victim.

Garner, 53, formerly known as Mr Morris Garner, was arrested last Thursday and charged with the offense. If found guilty she could face a potential life sentence.

The Mississippi state attorney general's office says Garner injected 'a silicone substance' into Marilyn Hale of Selma, Atlanta, on January 13, 2010, and Hale later died.

It is the second murder charge Garner faces, relating to illegal butt implant injections, with no training or licence.

In September last year, Garner was charged with the death of Karima Gordon, who travelled from Atlanta, Georgia to Morris's Jackson, Mississippi home to receive the treatment.

Ms Gordon, 37, died several days after the injection took place in late March 2011.

At the time of the hearing, Garner, who worked as a floral and interior designer alongside her makeshift cosmetic business, was described as a cross-dressing man and had entered the court registered as a man.

Records show this week that Garner was in the Hinds County Detention Center on Monday. According to the Huffington Post, Garner had been on house arrest awaiting the trial of the 2012 death of an Atlanta woman.

It has yet to be determined whether or not the implant that Garner used was real or counterfeit silicone and authorities are urging any other patients who were treated by Garner to come forward.
