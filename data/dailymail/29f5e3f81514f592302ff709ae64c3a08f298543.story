Surgeons have saved a cancer patient's life by removing part of his leg and attaching it to his arm.

Ian McGregor, 59, is thought to be the first person in the UK to undergo such a procedure.

The operation, which took 18 hours, was designed to allow surgeons to remove a huge tumour from Mr McGregor’s thigh and then to give them some tissue to cover the wound with.

Mr McGregor (pictured with wife Janis) became the first person to have experimental tumour removal surgery. He was treated at Newcastle's Freeman Hospital

Mr McGregor, from Sunderland, had a large and aggressive tumour in the top of his leg, the BBC reports.

It had spread from his thigh to his pelvis and 10 years of treatment had failed to keep it under control.

Mr McGregor, who lives with his wife, Janis, had to have surgery to amputate his leg and remove the tumour.

However, surgeons at Newcastle’s Freeman Hospital were concerned about how they would cover the hole that was left.

Surgeons needed to amputate Mr McGregor's leg but were worried about how they would cover the wound. So, they removed part of his calf to use as a graft once the leg and tumour were removed

As a result, they removed muscle and tissue from his calf and attached it to his arm to maintain the blood flow.

They then amputated his leg and removed the tumour.

Mr McGregor had a large cancerous tumour in his thigh and pelvis which had to be removed.

To do so, surgeons had to amputate his leg.

They were worried about how they would cover the large wound they would create.

So, they took part of his calf and attached it to the blood supply in his arm to keep it alive.

They then amputated his leg and removed the tumour before covering the wound with the calf tissue.

Once this had been done, they used the calf flesh to cover the wound.

The surgery, which took place in August 2013, started at 9am and did not finish until 3am the following day.

Mr McGregor told the BBC: ‘You just can't put into words what they did.

‘I couldn't imagine what they were telling me, how they would do it and if I would wake up from the operation.’

Mr McGregor says he was given a choice as
 to whether or not he wanted to go ahead with the operation.

He decided to go ahead because he was in constant pain and feared he did not
 have long to live.

He told the BBC that he cannot thank the surgeons enough.

To keep the calf flesh alive during the operation surgeons attached it to the blood supply in his arm

Once the surgeons had amputated Mr McGregor's leg and removed the tumour, they covered the wound using the flesh from his calf which had been attached to his arm. The operation took 18 hours

He said: ‘You can't describe the feeling, you think you're at death's door and then you wake up and think wow, I'm here. It's a wonderful feeling.’

The surgeons now intend to publish a report about the operation as they think it could open up a new approach to surgery.

Mr McGregor is recovering well and is due to be fitted with a prosthetic leg. He is currently tumour-free.
