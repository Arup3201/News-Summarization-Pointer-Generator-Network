A woman claims to have been pushed to the floor by a ghost after cameras caught her being thrown to the floor despite there being no-one around. 

Cecilia Carrasco, 34, says she felt someone shove her as she walked past the reception desk at her lawyer's office in Santiago, Chile. 

The CCTV footage, which was shown on a local TV report, quickly went viral in her homeland.

She said: 'I hit the ground hard and had to be taken to hospital in an ambulance. 

'I was inside for three days and I'm still off work as a result of my injuries. 

'I wasn't aware of anybody in front of me as I passed the reception desk talking to a girl, and as I looked towards the receptionist I suddenly felt two pairs of hands shove me over. 

'I hit the floor but when I looked up I couldn't see anybody, and I thought they probably had run off.'

Ms Carrasco said she had never believed in ghosts and is now frightened of leaving the house.

She added: 'When the receptionist told me that there was nobody there, I didn't believe them until they showed me the footage. Now I am convinced that it was a ghost because I felt the hands even though there was nobody around.'

Ms Carrasco (pictured) said: 'I'm worried the ghost might be after me. I have no idea why I was shoved over'

She said: 'I remember seeing a film where a ghosts kept attacking a woman and now I'm worried the ghost might be after me. I have no idea why I was shoved over.' 

Hospital staff confirmed the woman had head injuries conducive with having fallen over or been pushed over.

Local parapsychologist Rodolfo Orozco said: 'It certainly seems as if something supernatural happened here but in order to investigate it more, we would really need to look at the energy levels in the building, and so far we have not been invited to investigate by the owners.'

Doctors, however, are sceptical that it was ghosts saying that the woman had received a substantial blow to the head, and that could have caused confusion about the circumstances of her injury.

They were unable however to explain the video which appears to show her being shoved with some force backwards.
