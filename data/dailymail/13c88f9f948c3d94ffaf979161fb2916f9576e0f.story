Taking in the sights of Morocco's Marrakech is nothing short of magical, with its famous souk which houses over 60,000 stalls full of colourful handmade wares.

After getting lost in the labyrinth of narrow streets, holidaymakers can relax by the scenic pool at Thomson's Couples Medina Gardens resort, which makes for the perfectly romantic retreat.

The all-inclusive/half-board formula includes the use of three bars. There is also a pre-bookable spa - and two pools, one of which is for guests who want to relax in peace and quiet.

There is such attention to detail that  the rooms are often decorated with fresh rose petals and leaves, which adorn pillows, bath mats and even toilet bowls. 

Then there's the added thrill of towels and towelling robes being shaped into different animals each day just for sheer amusement.

The recently refurbished hotel is right on the doorstep of Jemaa el-Fna square, which is a mere five minutes' walk from restaurants, food stalls and the largest souk in the Arab world.

Some 60,000 shops and stalls are crammed into the labyrinth of covered streets which hold all manner of sights and sounds and traditional wares.  

While the Medina resort has a very contemporary feel, many Arabic features remain, which includes a 200-year-old tower which holds a rooftop bar which provides great views over the local area. 

Dining at the a la carte restaurant satisfies every food craving with themed nights and a wide selection of healthy and not so healthy treats.

For those wanting to explore the outside area, visitors can embark upon a guided visit to the Koutoubia Mosque, which is located about 200 metres west of the Jemaa El Fna souk.

From there, a visit to the Saadiens Tombs is the ideal opportunity to soak up some of the local culture - the tombs were sealed up for centuries until their rediscovery in 1917.

Hiring a tour guide is something to be considered in order to learn more about the history of the area and to visit places which sit outside of the typical tourist trail.

A guide is particularly useful when it comes to haggling in the souks - there are rarely any fixed prices - as they can advise what price you can best expect to pay for things.

Welcoming vendors will tirelessly invite you into their stall or small shop, to smell perfumes and spices or try on colourful scarves made out of saffron dyes. 

On certain days, crowds of people gather round to take part in rug auctions in which giant handmade carpets are taken home by the highest bidders - which is great fun to watch.

And in another part of the souk, ornate metalworks are created in front of your very eyes by skilled tradesmen, such as gates and intricate doors. 

Out in the square, a man sits with a table full of human teeth on display, while another stands with pet monkeys who will leap on your shoulder if you invite them to. 

There are dance troupes and snake charmers and strangely, sheep heads for sale, but despite such scenes, photo taking is not welcomed without offer of payment.

For something a little more relaxing, the breathtaking Marjorelle Gardens, also known as the Yves Saint Laurent memorial gardens are the perfect place to unwind. 

French painter Jacques Majorelle dedicated forty years of his life to create the enchanting garden in the heart of the Ochre City which is overflowing with exotic flowers and has picturesque ponds.

Anyone with a spirit of adventure, should opt for the 4x4 Atlas mountain excursion and climb over 2,000 meters above sea level.

Al fresco dining is an option on offer for those wanting to make the most of the sunshine

Groups can be taken on a tour over the rocky hills, stopping at various vantage points to take in some of the finest views which include small villages nestled away into the side of the mountains. 

From there, you can visit a traditional Berber village, where you will be invited to sample the tastiest mint tea made the old-fashioned way and bread handbaked in the house.   

For the ultimate in Moroccan luxury and romance, take in the sights of the Old City on board the most traditional form of transport in Marrakech - a horse drawn carriage at night.

Great expectations: Fine diners can choose to eat on the hotel's balcony and indulge in an exquisite banquet with views of the stunning grounds below

Choice: A wide selection of food is provided at the hotel's restaurants ensuring that every taste is catered for 

The Taste Of Riad at Dar Marjane restaurant is a must-visit. Situated in a beautiful courtyard, known as a Riad, a six-course meal awaits accompanied by belly dancing entertainment.

Those in need of some serious relaxation should head to the Lotus Privilege spa which features an outdoor decorative pool alongside places to lounge and drink traditional mint tea.

Guests are invited to enjoy a scrub in a relaxing tiled room which seats up to four people at one time, before enjoying a relaxing massage, with prices starting from £36 per person. 

Thomson offers seven night holidays to Morocco, staying at the 4T Thomson Couples Medina Gardens in Marrakech on a half-board basis from £267 per person.

Price is based on two adults sharing, and includes flights departing from Gatwick Airport and transfers.
