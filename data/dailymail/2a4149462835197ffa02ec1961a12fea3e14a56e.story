At 28, Matt Jarvis has made a considerable name in top-class football. He has performed with distinction, he has represented his  country, and clubs have paid more than £10million for his  services. Yet when his career is done, he may be remembered for a single, instinctive decision, taken on a spring evening in East London.

The circumstances are swiftly recalled: West Ham and Arsenal were without a goal at Upton Park when Jarvis ran into the penalty area and the Arsenal full-back, Bacary Sagna, responded with an artless lunge. His studs connected with the attacker’s knee, and we awaited the tumble and the  inevitable penalty. 

Instead, Jarvis did something extraordinary: he stumbled, staggered… and stayed on his feet. The ball ran loose, the chance escaped and the bewildered referee took no action. West Ham went on to lose the match, whereupon the roof fell in.

Clash: Matt Jarvis stayed on his feet after colliding with Bacary Sagna

At best, it was said, Jarvis was woefully naïve; at worst, he was criminally negligent. For by electing to do the decent thing, he had transgressed football’s most sacred code; the one which states that cheating is not merely acceptable but, where a penalty is at stake, it is compulsory. 

Here we should have some sympathy with Sam Allardyce, which is not a phrase which trips off the keyboard. The West Ham manager expressed his position with clarity. ‘A foul is a foul,’ he said. ‘You get slaughtered for diving but when someone is honest, you don’t get what you should get. There’s no reward for being honest.’ 

But he concluded, ruefully yet generously: ‘You can’t ask players who are honest to be any different. It’s against their nature. So you just hope the referee gives you the  decision you deserve.’

Indeed you do and, by failing to meet those reasonable expectations, the referee, Kevin Friend, deserves the harshest criticism. Given the clearest of views, Friend declined  to act upon the evidence of his eyes. With cheating so rife, we do not expect infallibility from our  officials but we do expect a  minimum of competence.

Criticism: Jarvis was labelled as naive for staying on his feet and not trying to win a penalty

It was at this stage that Gary Neville intervened and transformed a spat of small consequence into a curiously important debate. In the course of his brief media career, the former Manchester United captain has earned a reputation as a perceptive pundit. But from time to time his basic instincts emerge, and he reprises his rabble-rousing, ref-baiting glory days.

Neville didn’t begin to understand or even recognise the problem. Instead, he embraced the role of  the old pro: hard-nosed, telling it like it is. 

He sneered at poor, misguided Jarvis: ‘You can be an angel and do what Matt Jarvis did, and he can get a pat on the back from his Nan when he goes home tonight. Or he can win his team a penalty. And a professional in the game must say: You gotta go down.’

In other words, you’ve got to cheat, because you’re a pro. It doesn’t come naturally, mind. Not to an  Englishman. 

‘You’re not brought up in England to think about diving,’ says Neville. ‘We’re the only country that thinks the way we do. Every single country in Europe and the world would have said, “He’s mad.”. We naturally think, “Fantastic. Well done, son. You stayed on your feet”. 

‘But when you’ve been through the professional game and you’ve been stitched up by foreign players so many times … If you can’t beat ’em, join ’em’.

He seemed dimly aware that his attitude might raise a few eyebrows. But old pros care little for the  disapproval of civilians. 

‘I suppose in some ways people can say, “It’s disappointing to hear you say that, Gary”,’ he acknowledged. ‘Well, be disappointed. Because ultimately, that’s the game. That is the game!’ 

It is the kind of justification we have heard from cricketers who refuse to walk or sprinters who dally with stimulants. Everyone does it. That’s the game. And I’ve no doubt that Neville meant every word.

Equally, I’ve no doubt that he was talking dangerous nonsense. For he is not merely a media figure, he is a man who won 85 England caps and who now helps coach the national team. And the message from a national coach is that it’s  perfectly acceptable to dive and cheat, because that’s what Johnny Foreigner does.  

I cannot imagine how that goes down with all those teachers who attempt to instil honest values, all those parents who endlessly encourage their children because they believe that the game has uplifting lessons to impart, and all those young people who are entitled to expect civilised direction from a national figure and are given instead the cynical cliches of a disaffected old pro.

Before the week was done, Jarvis was starting to  reconsider. ‘Maybe I should have been a bit cleverer and do what other players have done. Perhaps then, I could have got the penalty,’ he said. I hope the thought was swiftly banished, because clearly he is much better than that.

For Matt Jarvis has been tested. In the course of those few micro- seconds, he weighed his decent instincts against his bogus ‘professional’ obligations. 

And, to his undying credit, his instincts won. The game was enriched by his decision.

Cardiff conjure their own tales of the unexpected

Cardiff City believe that Crystal Palace tried to discover their starting line-up at least a day before the teams met in Cardiff on April 5. In a furious letter to the Premier League, they claim that this constituted ‘an attempt to obtain a sporting advantage’. They note that ‘Palace succeeded in their efforts and achieved an unexpected 3-0 win’. And they reflect: ‘We will never know the extent to which the confidential information affected the outcome of the match.’

Personally, I haven’t the faintest idea if their complaint is well-founded. But I do wonder why anybody should take great risks in order to win ‘a sporting advantage’ over Cardiff. I marvel at the suggestion that advance knowledge of the teamsheet could deliver a decisive advantage. And I smile at the notion that any away victory in Cardiff could be described as ‘unexpected’.

Advantage: Crystal Palace beat Cardiff 3-0 in Wales at the start of April

But if that really is the case, then the League might scrutinise some of this season’s other, inexplicable shocks at the Cardiff City Stadium. Such as Spurs (0-1), Newcastle (1-2), Arsenal (0-3), Southampton (0-3), West Ham (0-2), and Hull (0-4). And I scarcely dare mention Liverpool (3-6). For fear of starting a scurrilous rumour.

It was a lively Friday in Blackpool, with a pitch invasion, a barrage of tangerines and tennis balls and the home coach sent  off for thumping one of his own substitutes.

Amid all the uproar, Blackpool lost to Burnley, and now stand on the brink of Championship relegation. And this at a club that enjoyed a season in the Premier League just three years ago.

How has it happened? The clues may be found on a banner flaunted at the Burnley game. It read ‘Oyston’s Cash Cow’, and it contrasted the fortunes of the Oyston family with those of the club they control. There is a strong local feeling that the Oystons have taken a great deal out of the charming old club while giving precious little in return. Of course, there may be counter-arguments to be made. But nobody was listening in Blackpool on Friday.

P.S. The week’s most delicious statistic could be found in a new list of sporting salaries.

Last season, Queens Park Rangers won four matches out of 38 and finished bottom of the Premier League, 14 points from safety. By contrast, Atletico Madrid finished third in La Liga, behind Barcelona and Real Madrid. They also won the Spanish Cup.

Crazy: Atletico Madrid's title-chasing stars were paid less last year than QPR

Yet Atletico’s players were paid an average salary of £1,734,067, while their counterparts at QPR received an average of £2,142,611 — a difference of more than £400,000. Were the high achievers of Atletico undervalued, or were the non-achievers of QPR grotesquely overpaid?  I know what I think.
