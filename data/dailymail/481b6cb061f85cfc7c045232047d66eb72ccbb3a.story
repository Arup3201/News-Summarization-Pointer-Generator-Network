Apple has come under fierce criticism for ditching Google Maps from its new operating system in favour of its own geographical app.

Some users are fuming over the poor quality of the replacement maps, which have odd routes (via rivers), incorrect addresses (miles away) and preposterous images (feet is a measurement, not an appendage).

But it has now emerged that the damage was entirely self-inflicted - Apple made a deliberate decision to dump Google, as the search giant is too much of a threat to its future business.

Users were highly critical of Apple 
Maps for iOS6 when it was released on Wednesday, complaining that there 
were errors abound in the new application and it was 'pretty but dumb'.

And when a senior tech executive was 
asked by the Guardian whether the change was made by Apple itself or by 
Google, the reply came: 'Duh - not Google.'

Both companies have worked closely 
together in developing Google Maps for the iPhone - a service which many
 smartphone users have become heavily dependent on.

But, since Google's Android operating
 system Android is the main rival to iOS, Apple has been reluctant to 
co-operate, and has now decided to go it alone when it comes to mapping 
for the iPhone.

The split had apparently been planned
 for over a year - but when Apple got round to releasing its own map 
software, the response was withering.

Many users are now hoping to hang on 
until Google makes a Maps app for iOS6 - as long as Apple does not block
 the software from appearing on the App Store.

Squashed: Someone has sat on Indianapolis

Apple has decided to go it alone and 
produce their own app, purchasing numerous mapping companies in the past
 few years to prepare for the transition.

They worked with Waze, TomTom and 
other companies for the mapping data, but the venue search results will 
rely heavily on Yelp's database, rather than Google's, and are thus 
vastly inferior.

While the new app has some improvements, it leaves a lot to be desired.

Houston, We Have a Problem:  Several of the corporate offices in downtown Houston appear to have gas stations on their roofs?

Public
 transportation routes are also not included in Apple's software and 
landmarks are mislabeled as gas stations, airports, or other unrelated 
locations.

'iPhone customers will suffer,' Sarah Rotman Epps, an analyst at Forrester Research, said to Businessweek.

'Apple
 believes that they can deliver a better experience for customers than 
Google, but in the short term, Google has a better mapping application.'

'What’s going to happen 
with the Apple maps, is that you’re literally not going to find things.

When you do find them, they might be in the wrong place or position 
geographically.

And if you do have it, the route to it may not be the 
optimal route.'

Waze
 CEO Noam Bardin

Sources
 told the magazine that the company was anxious to scale back it's 
relationship with Google, due to the companies' intense rivalry on the 
smartphone market.

Google's Android is now the world’s most popular smartphone software.

Users
 that were quick to update have found numerous errors with the new 
mapping software, complaining about duplicate islands, wrong locations 
and vanished buildings.

Waze
 CEO Noam Bardin, whose company worked to develop the maps, blasted 
Apple, saying that users will get lost if they use the software.

'They’re
 now coming out with the lowest, weakest data set and they’re competing 
against Google, which has the highest data set. What’s going to happen 
with the Apple maps, is that you’re literally not going to find things. 
When you do find them, they might be in the wrong place or position 
geographically. And if you do have it, the route to it may not be the 
optimal route,' he said to Business Insider.

For now, iPhone users will be able to reach Google Maps through a mobile Web browser.

TomTom has defended the product saying that as more people use it, it will improve.

TomTom defended the integrity of the 
map software, saying it provided only the data, and was not responsible 
for how Apple used it within the app.

A
 spokesman said: 'The user experience is determined by adding additional
 features to the map application such as visual imagery.

'User experience fully depends on the choices these manufacturers make.'

'We
 are confident about our map quality, as selling 65 million portable 
navigation devices across the world and more than 1.4m TomTom apps for 
iPhone in the past two years reaffirms this quality.'

Technology blogger Anil Dash wasn't into the company's excuses.

'They've used their platform dominance to
 privilege their own app over a competitor's offering, even though it's a
 worse experience for users,' he said on his website.

'Here in Manhattan, where I live, basic search by building names is profoundly degraded in Apple's maps search. "Bloomberg" doesn't find the Bloomberg Tower; on Google Maps it's the first result.'

He continued: 'Searching for its address "731 Lexington Avenue" yields that address on Lexington Avenue in Brooklyn. It's fine to think that perhaps I wanted the address in Bed-Stuy, but even appending "NY, NY" or "Manhattan, NY" still yields the Brooklyn address. Google maps has none of these comprehension issues.'

The final verdict? 'Apple's made a new product that actually is pretty but dumb,' he said.
