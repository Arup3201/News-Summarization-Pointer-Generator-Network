The beauty properties of snail slime were discovered by Chilean workers exporting snails to France who noticed their hands healed quickly

The notion of having snail slime all over your face isn’t terribly appealing, so it just goes to show what a hint of celebrity interest can do for an unconventional beauty treatment.

Sales of a new face cream containing the slime have almost tripled in the UK in just two months.

Earlier this year, friends of 34-year-old Katie Holmes, ex-wife of Tom Cruise, said she used just such a product.

Health food chain Holland and Barrett began stocking a version of the cream in 50 stores in June and then in all 700 of its branches a month ago. In that time sales have risen 189 per cent.

Snail Gel, which costs £19.99 for a 50ml pot, contains mucus secreted by the snails which is said to regenerate and repair the skin.

Its arrival follows that of snail slime facials. They involve having specially farmed creatures slither up and down your face and were launched at a beauty salon in Britain last month.

The £50 treatment was added to the menu at Simply Divine salon in Corby, Northamptonshire, having been pioneered in Japan.

Owner Diane Gower claims clients have been overwhelmed by the results. By using the cream, women can see if the slime works for them without going to a salon.

It is said to contain a cocktail of proteins, antioxidants and hyaluronic acid which removes dead cells, reduces inflammation and helps skin retain moisture.

The benefits for human skin were discovered by Chilean snail farmers who noticed their skin healed quickly without scarring when they handled the creatures which were being exported to France.

Snail Gel is the latest in a line of bizarre anti-ageing treatments, from bee sting venom to a placenta face mask. But some experts remain sceptical about its supposed properties.

Dr Adam Friedman, consultant at the Harley Street Dermatology Clinic, said: ‘There are a lot of naturally occurring lubricants which can moisturise the skin. I don’t know that snails do this more than anything else.’

Kyle Rowe, of Holland and Barrett, said the gel has been combined with aloe vera and lemongrass to make it more appealing.
