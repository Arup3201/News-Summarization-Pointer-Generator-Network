An A-grade student and school lacrosse star has been shot dead in a random drive-by shooting as she walked with friends to a sleepover to celebrate her 15th birthday.

Molly Conley was walking along a narrow road in a residential area of Lake Stevens, Washington on Saturday night when gunfire broke out and she was fatally hit in the neck.

Police received several calls at 11.18pm and officers rushed to the scene, where they found Molly unresponsive. None of her friends were injured.

Molly, who turned 15 on Friday, had planned to spend the night at a friend's house before her birthday party on Sunday. Instead, her friends attended a vigil for Molly on Sunday at a local church.

Michel Hazen, who lives around the corner from the street, told KIRO: 'Just as I was kind of drifting off to sleep, I heard a loud, maybe a yell or a scream or something.... Then I started hearing sirens.'

Police have not identified any suspects, and no arrests have been made. They said they are looking for a black SUV that was seen in the area.

Authorities are also looking into numerous 
other reports of possible drive-by shootings in the area, although it is
 not yet known if they are connected to Molly's slaying.

Molly was a freshman student at Blanchet High School in Seattle, where she had achieved the nickname '4.0' for her perfect grades.

Tayloni Mazyck, 11, is another innocent young girl who fell victim to a stray bullet. She was walking outside her home in Brooklyn, New York on Friday night as 17-year-old Kane Cooper opened fire at two men in order to settle an argument around 8:30pm, DNAInfo reported.

Tayloni was shot in the neck. The bullet ricocheted down her spine before becoming lodged at its base. She is unable to move her legs.

Cooper is charged with attempted murder, assault, criminal use of a firearm and reckless endangerment.

Friends and relatives remembered her as an accomplished student and actress and a talented lacrosse player who brightened up their days with her positive, caring attitude.

Conley even persuaded her mother and stepfather to be foster parents to babies waiting for permanent homes.

'Molly would help take care of them, and she was extremely passionate,' her mother Susan Arksey told the Seattle Times.

The president of the school, Tony 
Desapio, said he is devastated by the killing and is offering support and counseling to
 students.

More than 800 friends and fellow students
 gathered at Our Lady of Fatima Parish in Magnolia - where Molly 
attended church - on Sunday night to pray for Conley and her family.

Parents and children filled the sanctuary to honor Molly. Many students came wearing Blanchet's school colors, green and gold.

'It was a deep moment of sharing grief, 
and longing and missing Molly and a deep moment of trying to make sense 
of a real tragedy,' Desapio said.

'Molly was a vibrant, wonderful 
presences in our community. She was a blessing to us.'

Friends also expressed their sadness 
and condolences on Facebook. One of her closest friends, Iris Thatcher, 
uploaded pictures of the girls as she paid tribute.

'Thank
 you Molly for some of the best years I had ever had,' she wrote. 'I 
love you so much and this is so hard to go through knowing one of my 
best friends is gone.

'Thanks for being the best and impacting my life so greatly. RIP.'

Conley leaves behind a sister, who is a senior at the school, and a brother, who is in 10th grade.

Lake Stevens, the area where the shooting took place, has suffered several other shootings in recent weeks. There are bullet holes in signs near to where Molly was killed.

It is a suburban community with around 28,000 residents and largely made up with families. It surrounds a large lake around which many businesses and recreational activities center.

Snohomish County sheriff's Lt. Rodney Rochon confirmed that the major crimes team is assisting Lake Stevens police with the investigation, but as of Sunday, they had no further information about the crime.
