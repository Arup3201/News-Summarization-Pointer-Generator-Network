Nottingham Forest are on the brink of losing more first team stars with Jamie Mackie and Simon Cox holding discussions with Reading on Tuesday over a double move.

Manager Stuart Pearce reacted angrily on Monday following the decision to sell Jamaal Lascelles and Karl Darlow to Newcastle, claiming the moves away from the City Ground were against his wishes.

Mackie was a crucial component of the Championship side last term after joining for £1million from QPR, playing 49 times in total.

Cox arrived from West Brom for £2million in 2012 and along with Mackie had become a crucial part of the Forest attack in the last year.

A move to Reading would see Cox play in a second spell at the Madejski Stadium having begun his career with the Royals in 2005, making just a handful of substitute appearances before leaving for Swindon three years later.

For Pearce, the loss of two forwards will be a major blow ahead of the new Championship campaign, and will only add fuel to the fire in his rift with club owner Fawaz Al Hasawi.

Although the departure of Lascelles and Darlow will see the duo loaned back to the club for the 2014/15 campaign, the former Under 21 boss was unhappy at the sales worth around £7million.

Stars: But Jamaal Lascelles and Karl Darlow were sold on the cheap to Premier League side Newcastle United

'The players were sold without my sanction', Pearce said. 'I can't defend the decision to sell them because it wasn't my decision. I could sit here and lie and dress it up a little bit and cover the tracks of one or two individuals, but I'm not prepared to do that.'

However, Hasawi responded claiming: 'I would love nothing more than to hold on to our best young players. I gave both Karl Darlow and Jamaal Lascelles lengthy new contracts in August 2013 and March 2014 respectively.

'The manager and I openly discussed the proposed sale of Karl and Jamaal and he was aware of the negotiations throughout.'
