Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe was attacked after admitting discussing the 'Plebgate' case with journalists

Senior Tory and Labour MPs  yesterday lined up in the Commons to attack Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe over the ‘fabricated’ Andrew Mitchell ‘Plebgate’ affair.

In a deliberate show of strength, Conservative allies  of the ex-chief whip said Sir Bernard, Britain’s most senior police officer, ‘has a lot of questions to answer’ after he admitted discussing the case with journalists and breaking his own rules by not keeping a note of what was said.

Labour MP Tom Watson said: ‘What now seems apparent is he [Mr Mitchell] was the victim of media spin at the highest level of the Metropolitan Police.’

Mr Mitchell was forced to resign in October after officers claimed he repeatedly swore and called them ‘plebs’ when they refused to let him cycle through the main Downing Street gate.

However, a Channel 4 News investigation cast doubt on that account when it revealed CCTV footage showed there was not a large group of tourists at the gates at the time, as had been claimed. An email from a civilian witness backing up the officers’ version of events has also been called into question.

Mr Mitchell strenuously denies the allegation and was stunned when official Met reports were leaked earlier this year stating there was no evidence that police officers had lied about  the encounter.

He blamed the Met for the leak and described it as ‘a dishonest and illicit attempt to blacken my name and destroy my career’.

Last weekend, friends of Mr Mitchell used Freedom of Information laws to reveal that Sir Bernard had a meeting with journalists where the case was discussed but that no records were kept about exactly what was said – a breach of guidelines.

At Home Office Questions in the Commons yesterday, eight MPs asked about different aspects of the case.

Conservative MP Richard  Ottaway said there was now a ‘situation where the police and the Met appear to have  fabricated evidence against a Cabinet minister’.

Keith Vaz, Labour chairman of the Home Affairs select committee, said: ‘The Commissioner promised a ruthless search for the truth... but this has now taken eight months, involved 30 investigating police officers, and cost the taxpayer £144,000 for an incident in Downing Street that lasted 45 seconds.’

Damningly, Tory MP Crispin Blunt said the Channel 4 team might carry out the investigation more effectively and more independently than the police.

In response to the questioning, Police Minister Damian Green said: ‘The Metropolitan Police are conducting an investigation under the supervision of the Independent Police Complaints Commission.

‘I absolutely understand the importance and the very many lessons that may well be drawn from this case. What I should not do and will not do is draw any conclusions in the middle of the investigation.’
