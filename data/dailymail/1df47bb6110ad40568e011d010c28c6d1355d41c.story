It has been referred to as the black dog, the blues, or hitting rock bottom.

However it is described, depression and anxiety affects between one and two million Australians in any given year.

Often it is unexpected and can be severe, leaving those affected unprepared to cope with its onset.

This was the case for ex-military and ex-intelligence officer Hayden Bradford, whose experience with depression has shown that it can affect anyone.

In 2008, Hayden came home from work, staggered out of his car, and collapsed into the arms of his wife, who drove him immediately to the hospital.

'I’d had the blues before, who hasn’t?,' said Hayden.

'They were no biggie. They would come and go, but this time they didn’t go. This time they stayed and bubbled in my blood, scorching parts of my brain, turning a part of it to ash, and messing with it in ways I can’t explain.'

Hayden said he was thankful that his wife gave him no choice but to see a doctor. 

'He diagnosed me with some form of head trauma,' said Hayden.

'I was given a script for valium and anti-depression medication plus a referral to a psychologist. From memory I took a couple of days off work as recommended by the GP – I spent those first days in bed not eating and mostly crying and trying to see my way of a black hole.' 

Hayden spent the next two months battling his depression, trialing medications and other coping mechanisms while working.

In 2008, Hayden came home from work, staggered out of his car, and collapsed into the arms of his wife, who drove him immediately to the hospital.

'I’d had the blues before, who hasn’t?,' said Hayden.

When he informed his company that he had been diagnosed, his commission-based work dwindled, and efforts he had invested into obtaining contracts was disregarded, as were interstate trips that he was scheduled to go on. 

After being advised by medical professionals that he needed to take leave from work, his situation was made all the worse by his employers reaction to the diagnosis.

His employers flew a HR representative over to break the news that he would be let go. 

'They said, we don't want someone with depression working for us,' Hayden said. 

'That did wonders for my head,' he said sarcastically. 'Then they actually denied that I had told them about my condition.' 

Since that time, Hayden has discovered that he has a particularly acute form of depression known as 'severe chronic recurrent depressive disorder', and despite undergoing various treatments and receiving high dosages of medication has been diagnosed as treatment resistant.

'Basically, my neurons stopped talking to each other,' said Hayden. 

'I dealt with specialist after specialist, all credible and highly regarded in their chosen field of medical expertise in the science of the brain. We changed medication, changed dosages, and still my brain remained confused, and messed up.'

'My brain has been CAT scanned, MRI scanned, poked, prodded, and there are so many drugs running through it - I should be declared illegal,' he said.

His body's inability to respond positively to any form of treatment or medication left Hayden in a very precarious situation, who described his depression as leaving him suicidal at points. 

'It isolates me, it comes with a loneliness, a darkness, a frightening pain, and unless you’re a sufferer, it is very hard to understand it,' Hayden said.

But the ex-military man refused to give up and give in to the disease.

'In amongst dealing with psychiatrists, psychologists, and neurobehavioral specialists, I’ve had to reinvent myself.'

'It isolates me, it comes with a loneliness, a darkness, a frightening pain, and unless you’re a sufferer, it is very hard to understand it,' Hayden said.

'We all feel down in the dumps but if it's getting you really bad, just bite the bullet just get in front of the doctor. It doesn't matter how tough you might think you are, get help.'

'I didn’t want to be a couch potato type of person who does the old, “oh woe is me, please feel sorry for me, please have sympathy for me, because I’ve got depression,’ and so on,' said Hayden.

'I simply had to man up, and survive the best I could. I also have wife and two children to consider,'

'So my life just couldn’t be stopped or put on hold.'

Hayden decided to think laterally, and use unusual methods to engage his brain in order to force it into activity. This included writing, as 'the forced thinking that comes with writing, helps you to focus on issues apart from your state of mind'.

'Writing exercises the the creative side of my brain, in that it keeps me thinking,' Hayden said.

'This process stimulates brain activity, which assists in retraining my memory cells.'

The result of this writing is Hayden's book Travesty, a comical novel about an atheist who dies and is sent to Heaven. 

‘Travesty’, is not a self-help book, nor does it have anything to do with depression,' said Hayden.

'It is simply a funny story. It's all I did it for, purely to make my head laugh.'

While Hayden still suffers from depression, and experiencing low days, he is determined to put the conversation around depression into the public eye. 

'I'll never be cured. I can go into really lowly places,' said Hayden.

'Anyone that suffers from this kind of thing has to be prepared to lose friends, and some people will look at you like you're not whole anymore.'

'There is still a lot of stigma attached to it, but it's really important if you are experiencing depression or anxiety to try and do something about it.'

'I manage as best I can with my strategies, but there are other people out there who might not have sought help. They might think  that there's no way out, and if they're not on medication and dont understand strategies they might commit suicide.'

'I feel sorry for these people, and it's so important to seek help,' Hayden said. 

Now, the ex-military man is urging all Australians to consider their mental health a priority. 

'We all feel down in the dumps but if it's getting you really bad, just bite the bullet just get in front of the doctor. It doesn't matter how tough you might think you are, get help.'
