Sex advice was a lot more simple in the Eighties, says psychotherapist Philippa Perry in the BBC4 documentary Sex, Lies & Love Bites

The current generation of young people is the most confused about sex ever because of pornography, according to a psychotherapist.

Philippa Perry, 57, has claimed that easy access to explicit videos and images has left many young people unable to have normal and healthy relationships.

The mother-of-one added that the problem of young people not understanding the realities of sex is at least as bad now as it has ever been.

An agony aunt for Red magazine and The Guardian, she said she comes across problems caused by pornography time and again and that men are increasingly turning to such columns for advice.

The wife of Turner Prize-winning artist Grayson Perry, 54, she said: ‘These days people educate themselves about sex usually by watching the freely available pornography. They get a skewed idea about sex, thinking women have to be one way and it’s all about submission and domination when of course it isn’t.

‘People get the wrong idea about sex and lose their way because of pornography. I’m not against pornography but it is not the most helpful of sex education tools. The danger these days is posed by people being exposed too young to a certain type of sex and then they tend to think that is what sex is.’

This naivety about the reality of sex is different to that of young people from previous generations who turned to agony aunts for advice. While it used to be driven by a lack of knowledge about sex, the problem is now that people are exposed to pornography, often depicting aggressive and violent sex, at too young of an age. She said ‘it’s worse now, but I’m an old person so I would say that.’

She highlighted one case that she encountered of a young man who was so addicted to pornography that he could no longer become aroused by women in real life. She said this is not the only time she has come across this problem and that ‘it’s a huge problem in society.’

Mrs Perry, who is also a trained psychotherapist, made the comments ahead of presenting a new documentary for BBC4, broadcasting tonight. Sex, Lies and Love Bites: The Agony Aunt Story interviews advice columnists, from Graham Norton to the women behind Jackie magazine’s Cathy and Claire, to looks at how these columns reflect society’s changing attitudes, especially towards sex.

Gayle Anderson, who wrote the Jackie column between 1981 and 1982, said the internet has changed everything. She told Mrs Perry: ‘There was no social media [in the 1980s]. Now you would google a problem, we were the 80s Google really. They were basically sitting there waiting for puberty to hit, they didn’t know what was going to happen. They didn’t have sex education, mainly at schools.’

Sandy Monks, who filled the same role for two years from 1974, said she saw herself as the readers’ ‘big sister’ imparting advice.

This is a different tone from some modern day advice columnists, such as Graham Norton, who answers readers’ queries for The Telegraph. He said people should not take the suggestions too seriously and oddly implied that women should expect men to cheat on them.

Perry interviews Agony Aunts from publications such as Jackie and Red magazine for the BBC4 documentary, airing on Tuesday night at 9pm

He told the programme: ‘Agony aunts and uncles, across time immemorial, are not always right. You’re in an odd position, where you’re meddling in strangers’ lives and you’re judging a whole situation by one side, you don’t get the other side.

‘Women overthink men far too much and they think men are thinking when they are not, they are just doing. Most men get into trouble through their wallet or through their willy.

‘Women think that willies are more complicated creature than they are. So don’t feel too bad when it ends up somewhere else.’

One of the big changes Mrs Perry has noticed in her own column is how an increasing number of men are turning to her for help. She put this down to a crisis in male identity and men struggling to conform to traditional stereotypes.

She said: ‘There is quite a lot of pressure on men to be a certain way and they have more difficulty being themselves. It may be that women have more permission to be a tomboy than a man has to be more androgynous.’
