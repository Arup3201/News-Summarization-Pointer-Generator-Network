Bernice King, the daughter of Reverend Martin Luther King, normally shies from the national spotlight but she is now stepping directly into with several revealing interviews as part of the 50th anniversary of her father’s I Have a Dream speech.

Born mere months after her trailblazing father gave the iconic address in Washington, DC in August 1963, the typically reserved younger Reverend King is now cultivating an image that is more than the handful of photos from the civil rights era that so many Americans associate her with.

As she celebrates her father’s achievements in front of the public, King is also showing glimpses of herself rarely seen before and perhaps trying to step out from under the huge shadow undoubtedly cast by her famous father’s legacy.

Honor: Bernice King has stepped out of her father's shadow and into the national spotlight in recent weeks. Here, she helps commemorate her father's legendary 1963 I Have a Dream Speech

Struggle: Bernice King, the youngest of MLK's children is seen here in 1964. She was just 5 at the time of her father's death and has struggled with her place in his legacy ever since

Thousands swarmed the spot near the Lincoln Memorial Saturday to honor the anniversary of King's speech and the world changing orator's adult daughter was among them.

The 50-year-old reverend also recently sat for a CNN interview in which she attempted to dispel what, if any, notions the public has of her.

‘People just don't know me, period,’ she told CNN.

As for her not showing enough of herself so that people might begin to know her, some of King’s family members say that not quite so easy.

Bernice King, seen here in November, has shied away from national attention for much of her life. Now as she honors her father's achievements, the orator, lawyer and reverend has a chance to showcase her own

Shattered: Martin Luther King Jr. pushes Bernice on a glider swing in their backyard in 1964. King's assassination was one among a number of tragedies that have befallen the family over the years

‘If you're out among the people, and 
everybody thinks you belong to them and you've never met them, you, too,
would walk a little quieter,’ said her cousin, the Reverend Alveda 
King.

For
a lot of Americans, Bernice is the sad little girl with pigtails in a 
dress at her father’s funeral after his 1968 assassination.

She was just five at the time.

She describes the moment as a 
wrenching and irrevocably memorable one. And since the sad day in 
American history was caught on camera, many have never stopped seeing 
King as that little girl.

Some of those who know her as an adult don’t all like what they’ve seen.

Indelible: This image from King's 1968 funeral is what stands out in the minds of most who in reference to the name Bernice King

Meanwhile, others associate the youngest King with a 2004 march she held against same-sex marriage

Squabbles between her and her siblings have made national news ahead of her achievements as a reverend, lawyer, and orator.

Critics say her family has tarnished the King name by trying to make money of Martin Luther King’s legacy.

And
Bernice King was roundly criticized for leading a march against 
same-sex marriage in 2004. But her recent interviews have given her an 
opportunity to respond.

‘If I had to make the choice today,’ she old CNN, ‘it would be different.’

‘I have privately held beliefs,’ she said. ‘But when it comes to that, it's properly placed in the political and legal arena.’

King was among the thousands who celebrated her father's 1963 march on Washington on Saturday

King helped lead banner names like Nancy Pelosi and Al Sharpton in honor of her father

Tarnished? King has also been criticized, along with her brothers, for the sibling infighting related to how, and if, money should be made from their father's legacy

King, has spoken out in the past 
against gay marriage, while her late mother, Coretta Scott King, was an 
ardent gay rights supporter.

Regardless of her past controversies, King now has the opportunity to reshape her own legacy as she celebrates her father’s.

‘She
is not Martin or Coretta Scott King. She is her own person,’ says her 
old friend W. Imara Canady of the United Negro College Fund.

But
as she continues to shape her own personal persona, King might be 
looking to Coretta Scott King for at least a little inspiration.

‘My mother used to say that struggle is a never-ending process,’ she says. ‘You earn it and win it in every generation.’

Some see Bernice's recent entrance into the spotlight as an opportunity for her to showcase her own strengths and stand out as a leader like her father

A quote from Coretta Scott King may sum up Bernice's current state. 'My mother used to say that struggle is a never-ending process,' she says. 'You earn it and win it in every generation'
