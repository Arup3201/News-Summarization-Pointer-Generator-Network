As people across the United States struggle to stick to their New Year's Resolutions, an 11-year-old Montana boy is offering lessons in self-discipline and delayed gratification after winning a $500 prize from his parents for skipping sugary drinks for a year.

A year ago at Christmas time, Jon Sarisky's parents offered him and his older brother Andrew a choice - a guaranteed $100 then or $500 in a year if they avoid pop, milkshakes, hot chocolate and sugary beverages.

Patience brings rewards: Jon Sarisky, 11, poses alongside his jumbo check for $500 - the prize from not touching a soda for 12 months

Andrew took the $100. Jon took the challenge.

He tells the Livingston Enterprise that it wasn't that difficult, with the exception of remembering not to accept a pop at a friend's house.

He says he stuck to the challenge by thinking about ways he could spend the money. 

Jon's parents drafted a contract, which resembled a legal document, to enforce his behavior over the year to come.

The contract - signed by all parties on January 4, 2014 - is a promise to drink only water, though it allows plain milk as an exception.

Notwithstanding a medical disaster, Jon signed away his right to enjoy any other liquid sustenancne, with sofa, coffee, fruit juice and Gatorade all specifically banned.

To be extra sure, the contract included definitions of both 'drinking' and 'water', pointing out that soup was OK because it is considered 'eating'.

When asked by a local news reporter what he would do with the cash, Jon joked: 'I could buy 500 pops'. 

Contract: The agreement, drafted with legal precision, allowed Jon to drink only water and plain milk for an entire year
