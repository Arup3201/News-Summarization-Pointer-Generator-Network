Two 'premier league' bird egg collectors have been fined for stealing hundreds of rare eggs after a two year police investigation to find the culprits.

'Obsessive' collectors Marcus Betteridge, 52, and Seymour Crang, 49, built up a unique collection of rare eggs after stealing them from the nests of birds including lesser redpolls, tree pipits and redshanks.

Police raided their homes after a two year joint investigation with the RSPCA and National Wildlife Crime Unit and discovered hundreds of eggs, collecting equipment, photographs and diaries relating to activities at nest sites.

Five eggs of a lesser redpoll, four of a tree pipit, five linnet eggs and one of a redshank, all kept in a cotton-wool lined ice cream carton were found at the home of Crang.

Police also discovered a diary belonging to Mr Betteridge which contained hundreds of pages with detailed notes covering more than a decade of activity.

Newton Abbot Magistrates Court heard Crang and Betteridge are 'premier league' and 'obsessional' egg thieves with a 'twisted psyche'.

Betteridge, 52, from Totnes, was fined £1,000 after he pleaded guilty to the disturbance of Dartford warbler's nest. 

The RSPB lists the Dartford warbler on its 'amber; species list, meaning it is often considered among one of the country's rarer breeds.

The society's website said of the species: '(A) small, dark, long-tailed warbler is resident in the UK and has suffered in the past from severe winters. Its population crashed to a few pairs in the 1960s, since when it has gradually recovered, increasing in both numbers and range.'

His co-defendant, from Bittaford near Ivybridge, was also fined £1,000 after pleading guilty to unlawful possession of wild birds' eggs.

They were also ordered to pay £200 in costs each.

Nigel Butt, defending, insisted the pair were just 'passionate about their subject and have had to adjust their behaviour'.

Pc Josh Marshall, a wildlife crime officer, said: 'This prosecution and sentencing highlights the benefits of joint partnership working in tackling wildlife crime and the determination to bring offenders to justice.

'This should send a clear message to persons engaged in such criminal activity that they will be identified and brought to justice.'

Betteridge was a former associate of Colin Watson - Britain’s most notorious egg collector - who died falling from a tree.

Watson, 63, had a string of convictions for stealing rare eggs over a 14-year period which saw him fined £4,600.

Watson was killed when he lost his footing  and fell to his death after climbing three quarters of the way up a 40ft tree in hunt of a nest.

The RSPB confiscated a large part of his collection following a raid on his home in 1985.

More than 2,000 eggs, including golden eagle, osprey, sparrowhawk and red kite were found.

Enthusiasts: The pair were described as 'obsessive' bird egg collectors
