Australia captain Michael Clarke regrets warning England seamer James Anderson to 'get ready to have your 'f***ing arm broken' during the first Ashes Test last winter.

Clarke was fined 20 per cent of his match fee by the ICC for the remark in Brisbane, which was was picked up by the on-ground stump microphone and inadvertently relayed to the watching world.

The Australian acknowledged the confrontation, which was allegedly sparked when Anderson threatened to punch the hosts' Test debutant George Bailey in the face, may not have shown him in a good light but did not regret standing up for his team-mate.

'Maybe I hadn't said exactly what I said to James Anderson (previously), but I'd stuck up for my players on a number of occasions and it's never been picked up on the stump mic,' Clarke told www.cricket.com.au.

Squaring up: Anderson and Clarke have words during the winter's first Ashes Test

'I regret the language I used and I regret that I said it over the stump mic. 'The last thing I want is for boys and girls watching cricket to be going and playing club cricket and saying things like that to opposition players.

'I think it's unacceptable that the Australian cricket captain is setting that example.

'But I don't regret standing up for George Bailey one bit. I don't regret being extremely honest with James Anderson and telling him what Mitchell Johnson's plan was.

'I don't regret that - I just regret that everybody heard it and the language I used.'

Clarke dismissed talk that the spat 
was driven by a long-standing grudge between the pair, who first played 
against each other 12 years ago.

'The media like to do up that we have history,' the 33-year-old said. 'The only history I have is that England kept beating us.

'And he (Anderson) was a part of England and I was part of Australia.'

Clarke
 also said he hoped suggestions that people liked him more because of 
the row were wrong, adding: 'I think it's an insult if that's why it 
(public opinion) has changed.

'If people like me more because I said that to James Anderson, then I think that's very silly.

'If
 people think that all of a sudden I'm a good captain because I said 
that to James Anderson, then I think that's silly as well.'
