The British couple who managed to jump out of their motorhome before it plunged into a ravine in the Amazon jungle, said they were 'amazed' to have escaped unharmed.

Intrepid explorers Bruce Scott, 62, and 
Lesley Norris, 64, were left stranded hundreds of miles from civilisation when their Mercedes Unimog proved too heavy for a bridge they were driving over.

'Unfortunately the weight of the vehicle
was excessive and the bridge couldn't handle it,' Mr Scott told reporters in Manaus, Brazil, where the couple are recovering today.

'The vehicle simple 
plunged into the river below.'

But the couple, from London who have been touring Latin America for the past five-and-a-half years, have vowed to continue their adventures, with Mrs Norris saying: 'It has not put us off at all, we love travelling.'

Instead, they instigated an 
extraordinary trans-Atlantic rescue mission by ringing Miss Norris’s 
brother-in-law 5,125 miles away in Eastbourne, East Sussex, on their 
satellite phone.

He took 
down their GPS co-ordinates so they could be traced, then alerted Dover 
Coastguard who in turn contacted their colleagues in Falmouth, the 
co-ordinating station for international alerts, who duly raised the 
alarm with rescue services in Brazil.

A
helicopter was then scrambled to pick up the pair, but not before they had to spend a night under the stars in the sweltering rainforest, which is home to 
vampire bats, poison dart frogs and black caiman crocodiles.

Today, after being 
flown to safety and checked out by Navy medics, Mr Scott explained how 
their Unimog had collapsed a bridge on the remote 
BR-319 road as they headed from Porto Velho to the jungle city of 
Manaus.

'Luckily we were able to leap out before it fell,' he said before thanking the Brazilian rescue team and UK coastguard for 'doing such an amazing job'.

Miss Norris added: 'I thought it was all over when the bridge started to collapse. It's amazing we escaped unharmed.'

British Consul Vincent Brown said he would have advised the couple against making the trip if they had consulted him.

He said: 'If they had told me about their trip I would have convinced 
them not to take it, because of the risk and the road conditions.'

Mr Scott and Miss Norris gave up their jobs
for a life on the open road in 2006.

Miss Norris, used to live in the 
suburb of Teddington and was a British Airways stewardess for 20 years. 
Mr Scott, who sold his studio flat in West Kensington to invest in 
the Unimog - an off-road adventure vehicle adapted to include a double bed 
and porcelain flushing loo -  was a professional photographer who has also trained as a 
bus driver.

On a website about their trip, on 
which Mr Scott is pictured looking debonair in a pith helmet and white 
tuxedo with his arm around a uniformed Miss Norris, they described how 
they have visited Mexico and were attempting to drive the length of 
South America.

On her last blog entry before the 
accident, Miss Norris said life was getting tough in Brazil, with 
‘unseasonably hot’ temperatures of up to 40c making it unpleasant to 
sleep in the truck.

‘And then Bruce got a cold,’ she 
added, so they went to visit a ‘butterfly lovers’ paradise’ called 
Pousada Ecologica Rio Grande Rancho to relax.

But their journey came to a grinding 
halt on Tuesday when a bridge collapsed and the motorhome hurtled 30ft 
down the gully before turning on its side in a remote spot 200 miles 
south west of the nearest city, Manaus.

Miss Norris’s sister, 
Jenny, 62, whose husband Ken answered their call, said the couple 
managed to haul themselves out of the vehicle and ‘feel lucky to be 
alive’.

‘Bruce helped Lesley to climb out and 
then went back down and got a couple of chairs for them both so they 
could sit on the roadside,’ she said.

‘He went back down and got some tarpaulin and they slept on the road, hoping to be rescued.’

She added: ‘When Ken got the call he just rang the Coastguard straight away.

‘The first thing I heard about it was 
when I got home two hours later as he did not want to worry me. I am so 
glad he picked up the phone because I would not have known what to do.’

Miss Norris and Mr Scott were picked 
up by a Brazilian army helicopter yesterday and flown to Manaus, a 
popular tourist destination because of its proximity to the jungle. Last
night they were recovering in a hotel after being treated for exposure 
and cuts and bruises.

UK Maritime and Coastguard Agency spokesman Fred Caygill said: ‘It’s not the first time we’ve assisted people across the world.

‘This is a bit unusual for us as it’s 
not of a maritime nature, but there are no boundaries in search and 
rescue.’ The Foreign Office was informed of the couple’s plight and 
offered consular assistance, while the Brazilian army last night said it
will recover the couple’s vehicle.

Second-hand Unimogs cost at least £10,000 without being modified into motorhomes, while new ones cost up to £70,000.
