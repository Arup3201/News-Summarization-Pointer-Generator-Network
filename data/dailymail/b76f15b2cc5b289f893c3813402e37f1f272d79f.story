Alex Bruce says Hull are 'quietly confident' of reaching the Europa League play-offs despite being held to a goalless draw by AS Trencin on Thursday night.

The Tigers were favourites to beat their Slovakian opponents on their competitive continental bow in Zilina but came away from their third qualifying round first leg with a stalemate.

Tom Huddlestone should have won it for the visitors but saw his 61st-minute penalty saved and somehow flashed a point-blank follow-up against the bar.

Confident: Alex Bruce remains hopeful that Hull will advance to the Europa League play-offs

Bruce, who was one of City's most impressive performers in the centre of a back three, was not surprised the visitors did not get things their own way but is banking on a positive result at the KC Stadium to carry them through next week.

Experience: Bruce has been around for a while

'It was a tough game for us, particularly because we've only had a couple of friendlies and they are into their season,' he told Press Association Sport.

'Friendlies aren't the same as competitive matches so they were just that bit fitter than us, running round like whippets, which is a bit of a leveller.

'If it was during the season and we were at peak fitness and match sharp I'm sure we would have won quite handsomely. But we have had the benefit of that game now and I'm sure we'll be quietly confident of doing the job at home.'

Huddlestone has missed spot-kicks before, in the FA Cup and Europa League while at Tottenham, but Bruce was surprised to see his side's dead-ball specialist falter from 12 yards.

'I think everyone in the ground thought it was going in, we all know how cleanly Tom strikes the ball,' he said.

'The second chance, I think he just thought it was too easy, a rush of blood.

'I'm sure he'll be beating himself up about it but we'd prefer him to do it in a game like last night when we've got another chance at home.

'We've missed a few penalties as a side so I'm going to start taking them, but then we really would be in trouble.'

Hull handed debuts to summer signings Tom Ince and Robert Snodgrass in the second half against Trencin, and Bruce expects to see plenty more of them as his father Steve shuffles the pack this season.

Improvement: Bruce produced some sterling performances for Hull last season

He added: 'We could have a lot of games this year so it's important to have a big squad and utilise that for each game.

'The new lads did have a bit of impact when they came on and we need to keep it fresh.

'I'd be very, very surprised if we see the same team again for the next match.'
