A church volunteer has been arrested after her four-year-old son called police to say he was hungry.

The little boy called 911 around 8.30am on Wednesday and police immediately went to his home at the 11800 block of Frank Haskell Court in Bristow, Virginia.

Officers found the youngster alone and it is believed he had been left by his mother, Love Sonia Altagracia Polanco Franklin, for two hours.

Police were eventually able to contact Franklin, 43, who arrived back at the home.

Police charged her with felony child neglect, but she was later released from prison on personal recognizance.

She faces a court hearing but a date has not yet been scheduled.

On Thursday, authorities said that another relative is taking care of Polanco Franklin’s son, the Washington Post reported.

Her Linkedin page indicates that she’s works in television and video production, as well as working as a student teacher in Prince William County and Fairfax County Public schools.

According to the page, she also works as a volunteer at Chapel Springs Church and lists 'children' and 'human rights' under 'causes I care about'. She also plans to write a children's book.

Her Facebook page also shows her posing with her husband and young son, most recently tagging a photograph of him with the caption: 'God's gift'.
