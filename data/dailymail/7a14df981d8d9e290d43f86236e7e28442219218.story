For many couples, space from one another is a vital part of a healthy relationship.

But for one couple who live in the West Village in  New York space is simply not an option because their tiny apartment  measures just 242 square foot.

Despite this, Jourdan Lawlor and her boyfriend Tobin Ludwig have become used to moving the couch out of the way before they can go to bed every night.

Couch: When the couple decide to go to sleep, they have to move the couch before they can pull the bed down

Time for bed: When Ludvig pulls the bed down it has a duvet on it already which helps to save time making it up

The couple have a fold out 'Murphy bed' literally next to their front door. 

And when they decide to go to sleep, they have to  move the couch before they can pull the bed down, which has a duvet and pillow on it already made up. 

The cramped property also features a little bathroom with a door made from reclaimed wood on barn door sliders.

Meanwhile, the kitchen, which takes up most of the leftover space, features an oven, a 'big' mini fridge, pots and pans hanging from the ceiling and a wooden table where they put a bowl of fruit.

The limited space means that the couple have to plan their meals very carefully.

'We really only shop for one or two meals at a time, no Costco trips in this house!' Ludwig told ABC 7 News.

In the space that's left, they have a minuscule walk-in closet and a tiny attic above the bath.

'So we're renting that [attic] now on Craigslist for $275-a-week, if anyone's interested!' Ludwig joked.

The original wooden dining room table is another space-saving design that takes up only three inches in the wall and has been made to look like a cupboard. 

But   it provides the couple with two benches and a wooden table when it's pulled down for use.

'It just has so much character,' Ludwig said. 'Then you squeeze,' he adds, as he moves to the back of the table to sit down.

Marriage: The couple plan to get married on New Year's Eve after living in very close proximity to each other

The bathroom and kitchen were redone as a part of a $33,000 renovation on the apartment which they bought three years ago for $270,000. 

In previous years, the apartment used to be used as a dorm for Hudson River dock workers.

However, their small living unit  is not the city's smallest pad. A studio in Manhattan's Upper West Side is just 90 square foot and measures 12 feet by 7 feet.

It is being rented by Felice Cohen who pays just over $700 per month for her microstudio in an area where the average rent for an apartment is $3,600 per month.

And while living in such close proximity could have spelled disaster for this couple's relationship, it appears to have worked out well for them as they plan to get married in the New Year.

Lawlor said: 'We plan to get married on New Year's Eve. I don't know about long term plans, but our dream is to be able to keep this [apartment] as a pied-a-terre.'
