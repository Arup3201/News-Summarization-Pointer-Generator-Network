These incredible photographs showcase the vibrant landscape, wildlife and community vibe of the Falkland Islands.

The images, which are going on display next week as part of a new exhibition, highlight a different side to the island which has been hit with war and poverty in previous years.

From beautiful scenery to amazing wildlife, the stunning photographs capture the exquisite landscape and warm communities which now inhabit the island in the South Atlantic.

The pictures, which have been taken by both professional and amateur photographers who submitted their pictures for a competition run by the Falkland Islands Government, show a community proud of their beautiful environment, self-sufficiency and historic links with the United Kingdom.

Krysteen Ormond, from Falkland Islands Government, said: ‘The exhibition is a brilliant introduction to life on the Islands, and we hope that a large number of visitors will be tempted to come to the Islands to see our wonderful home for themselves.’

All of the photographs will be on display at the free ‘We Are Falklands’ exhibition, which is to be held at Mall Galleries near Trafalgar Square, central London from Monday until July 27.
