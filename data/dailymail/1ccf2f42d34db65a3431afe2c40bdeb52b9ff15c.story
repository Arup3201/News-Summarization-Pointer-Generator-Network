The dad of England star Rickie Lambert has been sacked from his job after breaking a glass panel on a drinks machine.

Ray Lambert, 54, was sacked after he says he accidentally broke the panel while trying to retrieve a £1 cup of coffee.

The father-of-three was escorted out of clothing giant Matalan’s distribution warehouse in Knowsley, Merseyside by security guards last week.

The father of Rickie Lambert, pictured arriving in Brazil ahead of the World Cup, has been fired from his warehouse job, it has been revealed

A former workmate said Ray is due to fly out to Brazil next week with wife Maureen, 57, to watch his son in action at the World Cup.

He was said to be ‘fuming’ over his dismissal from his £20,000-a-year job and is considering an appeal.

The former colleague, who asked not to be named, said: 'It's a joke. Loads of people give that machine a nudge when it doesn’t work properly.

'But to sack him for something as trivial as that was pathetic.

'Ray’s worked at that warehouse ever since it opened. He had put his money into the vending machine to buy the coffee but the cup got lodged in the machine.

'He gave it a little shove to try and dislodge it but accidentally broke the glass panel.'It wasn’t done with any malice. It had got stuck and he was trying to get it out.'

But Matalan said there had been 'substantial damage to company property'.

A Matalan spokeswoman said: 'Matalan confirms that an employee was recently dismissed from the company following an act of gross misconduct involving substantial damage to company property.

'Matalan takes its responsibility as an employer very seriously and has conducted this dismissal in accordance with the company’s disciplinary policy.'

Mr Lambert is understood to have worked for Matalan for ten years, first at the company’s headquarters at Skelmersdale and then at the Knowsley warehouse.

The couple live in a modest terraced home less than half a mile from the warehouse. The colleague added: 'He didn’t deliberately smash the glass.

'He’s got lots of friends at the warehouse and is popular among his colleagues.

Ray Lambert and his wife Maureen are due to fly out to Brazil to watch their son Rickie Lambert, pictured with the ball against England's recent clash with Ecuador

'He likes to work even though his son is a millionaire and he doesn’t have to.

'Rickie may have just signed to Liverpool for £4m but Ray has always been keen to stand on his own two feet.

'He and Maureen are desperately proud of what Rickie has achieved and I am sure that this will not destroy their trip to the World Cup.'

Lambert signed a two-year-deal with boyhood club Liverpool earlier this month having starred for Southampton in the Premier League in the past two seasons.

His parents plan to fly out to Brazil to watch him play in England’s last two group games against Uruguay and Costa Rica.

Mr Lambert refused to comment about his sacking.
