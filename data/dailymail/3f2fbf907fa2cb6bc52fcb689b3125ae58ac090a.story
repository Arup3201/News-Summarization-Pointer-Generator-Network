Police announced Wednesday they had closed an investigation into sexual assault claims by a former University of Missouri swimmer who committed suicide without charging anyone for her alleged rape. 

Investigators in Columbia, Missouri, 'encountered several obstacles' while looking into claims Sasha Menu Courey made to health professionals that she'd been sexually assaulted by up to three football players as a sophomore.

Without DNA evidence, video recordings or a detailed recounting of the alleged assault, police could only rely on witnesses, who would not cooperate with the investigation, spokeswoman Bryana Maupin said.

Prospect: Sasha Menu Courey was 20 when she died, her swim career cut short after being considered a prospect for the Canadian national swim team and heavily recruited by University of Missouri

After Menu Courey's suicide in June 2011 at the age of 20, an independent investigation found the University of Missouri had failed to properly respond to the swimmer's sexual assault claims.

While some of the people Menu Courey told she had been raped were medical personnel bound by confidentiality rules, ESPN reported that the former Mizzou student wrote in a diary that she had spoken about it with an athletic department administrator. 

A story in the Columbia Daily Tribune in 2012 also noted that Courey mentioned the sexual assault in her journal.

Under Title IX rules, an education institute is required to begin an appropriate investigation as soon as a possible sexual assault is known.

Menu Courey's parents told ESPN that instead of the university following up on the report of sexual assault, head swimming coach Greg Rhodenbaugh stop speaking with them.

Raised in Toronto and once considered a prospect for the Canadian national swim team, Menu Courey had struggled with undiagnosed borderline personality disorder that had led her to attempt suicide when she was 16.

Mizzou: Rolandis Woodland, a friend of Menu Courey and a football player, said she sent him a video of the assault, which showed three men involved, though he claims the video has disappeared

In February 2010, when she was in her second sophomore semester, Menu Courey claims she was sexually assaulted after a consensual encounter with a male friend.

We 'were falling asleep & then i heard the [door] open & some other guy walked in & locked the door & i couldnt really see who it was & i never saw a face the whole time,' Courey wrote in an online chat with a rape crisis counselor later uncovered in a records request.

'i remember just sitting upright in bed at the sound of someone walking in. & i just remember feeling really scared thinking that the two guys had planned this or something.' 

'so my first thought was figure out who this other person was in case so that if i needed the informaton i would have it later... the guy told me his name & then he pulled down his pants & put on a condom & just knew i was screwed ...'

'the guy just lift up my dress & next thing i knew he inserts from behind. by that point tears were falling more but i wasnt loud & didnt anything. and then i just snapped and kind pushed him away & yelled no! and then he just left.'

Seeking answers: Rolandis Woodland (right), a University of Missouri football player and friend of Menu Courey's, said she started talking about suicide the morning after the alleged assault by fellow players

A friend, Rolandis Woodland, who played football at University of Missouri, said Menu Courey began speaking about taking her own life the morning after the assault allegedly occurred. 

Two months later, she entered treatment at the campus hospital to deal with her suicidal thoughts, after which she started seeing counselors and taking anti-depressants. 

After a back injury, coach Rhodenbaugh asked her not to take part in training and competitions, which he told ESPN was to motivate her to focus on counseling, in spite of records that showed Menu Courey had not stopped going.

In March 2011, as she experienced mood swings and anxiety that her scholarship and place on the University of Missouri swim team were in jeopardy, she entered the school's psychiatric center.

After being released to her parents, she went to a hotel where she slashed her wrists before a police officer was able to wrest the razor blade out of her hands. 

It was during a 96-hour hospitalization following this incident that a member of the Missouri athletic department, Meghan Anderson, visited Menu Courey and had her sign a University Withdrawal Form, which coach Rhodenbaugh characterized as a way to prevent her grades from falling.

In the aftermath, Menu Courey began worrying more about school. She moved to Boston and was admitted to McLean Hospital for borderline personality disorder, which one doctor there told ESPN had been worsened by the alleged attack.

In May, she called Anderson and spoke to her about the rape, according to a journal that she kept, though Anderson claims the conversation was about Menu Courey returning to school.

Later that month, she received a letter from the university informing her she was no longer eligible for financial aid, though the university described it as a form letter sent to student who had withdrawn from the school and said it did not apply to Menu Courey's athletic scholarship.

In June, the former Mizzou swimmer ingested 100 tablets of Tylenol while still hospitalized, dying two days later from organ failure.
