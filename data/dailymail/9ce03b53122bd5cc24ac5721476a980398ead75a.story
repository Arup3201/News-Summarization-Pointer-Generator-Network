The future of the head of the civil service looked bleak last night after he was given only lukewarm  support by No 10.

David Cameron’s official spokesman denied rumours that the Prime Minister was trying to force Sir Bob Kerslake out over the slow pace of Whitehall reform.

He added: ‘The Prime Minister fully supports the work that Bob Kerslake is doing.’

Representatives of Number 10 have been forced to deny rumours that David Cameron is trying to force Sir Bob Kerslake out over the slow pace of Whitehall reform

But another Downing Street source said he was only safe ‘for now’ – a sign that his days are numbered following his failure to modernise the outdated civil service.

It has been reported that Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood has been asked by Mr Cameron to draw up a shortlist of possible successors.

A progress report on the Government’s civil service reform plan this week found that only seven out of 18 targets had been met since it was launched last year.

This is thought to have angered Mr Cameron, who believes the civil service is a roadblock to reform.

A spokesperson said Cameron 'fully supports Sir Robert, while another Downing Street source said the top mandarin was only safe ¿for now¿

Sir Bob’s detractors are said to call him ‘Bungalow Bob’, because they claim he has little ‘up top’.

Sir Bob is known to have links to the leadership training firm Common Purpose, a sort of old boys’ network for the Left.

Founded in 1989, it uses taxpayer cash to run courses for civil servants. Many of its 35,000 ‘graduates’ hold top public-sector jobs.

Sir Bob used Common Purpose as head of Sheffield Council, and writes on the firm’s website: ‘I have been involved with Common Purpose over a number of years.’

Its founder, Julia Middleton, launched the Media Standards Trust with Common Purpose’s ex-chairman Sir David Bell, who worked on the Leveson Inquiry.

The trust presented evidence to Lord Justice Leveson and spawned the Hacked Off pressure group.

But others say he is simply overworked, having been given two jobs; head of the civil service and permanent secretary of the Department for Communities and Local Government.

A spokesman for the Institute for Government think-tank said the blame could not be pinned on Sir Bob, adding: ‘To make this ambitious reform plan succeed will take more than the efforts of one or even a few at the top of Whitehall.

‘It will require a team of top civil servants and senior ministers.’

Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude said this week he was unimpressed with the progress of reform.

Four targets have been significantly delayed, including sharing expert services across Government, establishing a plan to fill Whitehall’s skills gaps, increasing secondments from the private sector, and creating a modern workplace with effective IT.

Yesterday, he said: ‘We would all say we are not happy with the progress. There is progress we are proud of on some things.

'On others, we didn’t put in place early enough the right resources and the right leadership.’
