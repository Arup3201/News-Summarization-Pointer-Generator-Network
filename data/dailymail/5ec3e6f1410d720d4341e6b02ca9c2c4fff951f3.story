UKIP were accused of scaremongering by a Home Office minister yesterday after the number of Romanians and Bulgarians working in Britain fell slightly.

Those in jobs from the two countries dropped by 4,000 in the three months after employment restrictions were lifted on January 1 compared to the three months before.

But despite the surprise dip the total number working here was up by 29,000 – nearly 26 per cent – in the first quarter of this year compared to the equivalent period in 2013.

There were 140,000 Romanians and Bulgarians working in Britain in January-March, down from  144,000 at the end of 2013

The
 Office for National Statistics said there were 140,000 people from the 
two eastern European countries in jobs in the UK between January and 
March this year.

Ukip's Nigel Farage was roundly attacked today for stoking fears that Britain would be swamped by Romanians and Bulgarians. Figures showed that the number of migrants arriving in the UK from the two countries actually fell in the first three months of the year

That was 
down from 144,000 in the three months to December, before Romanians and 
Bulgarians gained the same rights to work in Britain as other EU 
citizens.

The figures do not include dependent family members of immigrant workers or the unemployed.

Before
 employment restrictions were lifted ministers repeatedly refused to 
estimate how many Romanians and Bulgarians would arrive in the UK, 
leading Ukip to raise concerns that a ‘massive influx’ would place extra
 demands on public services and depress wages.

Amid
 growing worries the Government introduced measures to  prevent EU 
migrants from claiming unemployment benefits for their  first three 
months here, while those found begging or sleeping rough could be 
deported.

Yesterday, after 
the figures were published, Tory Police Minister Damian Green hit out at
 the rhetoric from Nigel Farage’s party.

He said: ‘They started 
scaremongering in the run-up to January 1.

They have been proved wrong 
and they have decided to carry on scaremongering.’

Tory
 minister Anna Soubry said: ‘These figures just show that Ukip preys on 
people’s fears, it preys on prejudices in many people. And they make 
these wild, actually rather offensive claims, and hey, what happens? It 
was all a load of nonsense.’

Employment minister Esther McVey said the predicted influx had not happened

Lib
 Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable added: ‘This idea of waiting for 
tens of thousands of people pouring off the planes from the Balkans was 
just a scare story.’

Labour
 MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, 
said: ‘Those, including Ukip, who promised the end of the world on 
January 1, now owe the public and those from Romania and Bulgaria a full
 apology.’ 

But critics 
pointed out that the number of workers from Romania and Bulgaria had 
increased by 43,000 – or 44 per cent – since the first three months of 
2012.

They also suggested that the December peak meant many arrived in the UK in time for the lifting of employment restrictions.

Sir
 Andrew Green, chairman of MigrationWatch, said: ‘The latest annual 
figures show an increase of 29,000, in a period when restrictions were 
in place for nine months. We believe they are consistent with our 
estimate of a 50,000 population increase from Romania and Bulgaria for 
each of the next five years.’

Dr
 Carlos Vargas-Silva, senior researcher at the Migration Observatory at 
the University of Oxford, said: ‘Until we have complete data for 2014 it
 is impossible to achieve any definite conclusions about the impact of 
the end of restrictions.’ 

Ukip
 head of policy Tim Aker said: ‘We never said it would just be about 
Romania and Bulgaria. We are looking at the massive influx from the EU.’

The number of Romanians and Bulgarians working in the UK is up by almost 26 per cent year-on-year, compared to 1.8 per cent for people born in the UK.

There are a record 30.430million people in work, up by 283,000 on the end of last year

Unemployment has fallen by more than 300,000 over the past year, giving jobless rates of 7 per cent for men and 6.4 per cent for women.

The number of people in a job rose 283,000 in the last three months - the largest quarterly increase in 43 years. 

The number of unemployed young people has been falling for the last eight months.

Employment minister Esther McVey said: 'As the recovery takes hold, more people are able to get a job or set up their own business and become the employers of tomorrow.

'Each and every person who has made a new start or hired someone new is helping to make Britain a more prosperous and confident place to be.

'We will continue to support those in and out of work who want to get on and fulfil their ambitions for a more secure future.'

The number of people claiming jobseeker's allowance last month fell by 25,100 to 1.12 million. 

Danny
 Alexander, Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Tresury, said: ‘This further 
big rise in employment shows again that our jobs rich recovery is 
becoming firmly established. 

'It follows strengthening economic growth figures and positive news on inflation. 

The
 very modest numbers of Romanians and Bulgarians coming to work in 
Britain this year is in stark contrast to the inflammatory rhetoric of 
earlier this year. 

'Overall
 today's figures are good news for the people of Britain, and bad news 
for those who would threaten our recovery by turning the clock back.'

Mr Cameron yesterday insisted his promise to get immigration below 100,000 a year is still 'achievable'.

But Mr Cameron insisted: 'The target remains. I think it is absolutely achievable'. Appearing before the House of Commons Liaison Committee, he declined to discuss the figures for Romanians and Bulgarians before their publication, but said that his administration had brought net migration down by one-fifth since coming to office.

He also wants to stop millions of pounds being sent abroad each year in child benefit for children who live elsewhere in the EU.

There are around 24,000 families claiming for 40,000 children, with two-thirds of the children based in Poland.

Total pay is up by 1.7 per cent, while the CPI rate of inflation is at 1.6 per cent

Mr Cameron said he had not made 'anybody who thinks that is sensible' but admitted that under existing EU rules 'it seems impossible to change that'.

He told BBC One's Marr Show: 'We are very clear about what we want to achieve. Let's end benefit tourism, let's make sure the single market is properly safeguarded.

'Let's make sure that Parliaments can get together and block unwelcome proposals from the European Commission.

'Let's make a series of changes to make Europe more flexible, more competitive. Those are the sorts of things I want to see.'
