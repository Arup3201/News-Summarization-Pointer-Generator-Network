Naked self-portraits last night appeared on the Facebook account of a former London deputy mayor.

Richard Barnes, 65, who is the Conservative councillor for Hillingdon, west London, claimed the photographs of the naked lower body of a man were posted after his account was hacked.

Mr Barnes told MailOnline he was 'sad' about the appearance of the photos - which were apparently taken on an Apple iPhone and seen on his account yesterday afternoon before being removed.

Mr Barnes told MailOnline last night: ‘I've had 30 years in politics and I’m not f****** stupid and it's not the sort of thing I would do. I didn't know about it until a friend told me. I've deleted them all now.

‘I know my sheet is clean. You just have to ride the storm. But I trust my 30-year record stands for what it is. It's just sad that I can be a target. I'm hacked off, to pardon the pun. These things happen.’

The story first appeared on Trending Central, which suggested the images could have been uploaded automatically from his iPhone onto Facebook. But Mr Barnes insisted he was hacked.

Mr Barnes, who is openly gay, was Boris Johnson’s deputy between 2008 and 2012. He said a friend in the US had told him about the images and everything had now been ‘sorted out’.

A Hillingdon Council spokesman was not immediately able to comment on the matter to MailOnline.

The
 photos have been compared to those of US politician Anthony Weiner, who
 was forced to resign as a congressman in 2011 after admitting 
exchanging lewd photos with young women on Twitter.

Then,
 while running for New York mayor earlier this year, married 49-year-old
 Mr Weiner detailed his sexual fantasies, including sex in the shower, to a
 23-year-old woman called Sydney Leathers.

But while Mr Weiner was confirmed to have been in those photos, Mr Barnes insisted he was hacked.
