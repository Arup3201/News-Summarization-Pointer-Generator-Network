Overdose: It was revealed Thursday that Florida megachurch Pastor Zachery Tims died from an overdose of cocaine and heroin when he was discovered dead in a New York City hotel room two years ago

New York medical examiners revealed today that the Florida megachurch leader and father of four discovered dead in a Times Square hotel room two years ago died from a cocaine and heroin overdose.

The cause of death in Pastor Zachery Tims' death wasn't revealed until today, following his mother's failed legal battle to keep the autopsy results a secret.

Tims founded the 7,000-member New Destiny Christian Center in Apopka, Florida with his then-wife Riva in 1996. 

According to the Orlando Sentinel, the church built a $3.4million 34,000-square foot building in 2005, complete with a youth center.

But
 Tims life took a turn in 2008 when his wife of 15 years filed for 
divorce, citing 'multiple and repeated extramarital sexual affairs'.

Following the divorce, he even briefly stepped down from his position to deal with his personal 'indiscretions'.

Tims
 used his past of crime and drug abuse often in his sermons, and even 
wrote a book about his troubled youth called 'It's Never Too Late: How a
 Teenage Criminal Found His Divine Destiny and Became a Successful 
Millionaire and Pastor of a Thriving Church'.

But
 Tims surprised his congregation when his body was discovered by housekeepers on August 12, 2011, looking to clean his room at the W Hotel in Times Square, New York City.

His death was quickly suspected to be an overdose when police found a packet of white powder in his pants pocket.

Megachurch: Tims started the New Destiny Christian Center with his then-wife in 1996. The church has 7,000 members who attend services in a $3.4million 34,000-square-foot building

Break-up: Tims is pictured with his ex-wife of 15 years, Riva. The former Mrs Tims filed for divorce in 2008 citing her husband's multiple extra-marital affairs

Tims' friends and family were seemingly unaware of his relapse, and said they didn't even know what he was doing in New York at the time.

Ex-wife Riva told Ebony magazine that she knew about his past drug abuse, but didn't know he was still using. 

'I
 had no idea it was so much. I'll put it this way: it's one thing to 
have a struggle; it's another thing to have a lifestyle,' she said. 
'When it's a struggle, there's grace. But when it's a lifestyle, there's
 no grace.'

No clue: After their break-up, Riva went to start her own church in Orlando. She said she was unaware that her husband had relapsed when a packet of white powder was discovered in his pants pocket after he died

After
 their break-up, Riva started her own church in Orlando, Majestic Life 
Ministrities, and briefly tried to reassert control of New Destiny.

Evangelist T.D. Jakes spoke at Tims funeral, calling him a flawed man who preached to flawed people.

'He tried to heal himself, to fix himself,' Mr Jakes said.

Tims left behind four children.
