Team news

Sunderland

Sunderland head coach Gus Poyet will welcome defender Wes Brown back to the squad for Saturday's home clash with Stoke.

Brown missed last weekend's 0-0 Barclays Premier League draw with Swansea because of a calf problem, but has returned to training and is available once again.

However, loan signing Sebastian Coates is out with a thigh injury, while midfielder Emanuele Giaccherini remains a doubt with an ankle problem.

Provisional squad: Mannone, Pantilimon, Jones, Van Aanholt, Brown, O'Shea, Vergini, Roberge, Cattermole, Bridcutt, Rodwell, Gomez, Larsson, Johnson, Buckley, Giaccherini, Alvarez, Mavrias, Wickham, Altidore, Fletcher, Graham.

Stoke 

Mame Biram Diouf is set to miss Stoke City's Barclays Premier League trip to Sunderland after limping off in the Monday night win over Newcastle.

But early indications suggest Diouf's injury is not as bad as first feared and he will be fit to return following the international break.

Marko Arnautovic is set to come in to replace Diouf while Geoff Cameron could also figure in the squad as he returns from five weeks out with a hernia problem.

Provisional Squad: Begovic, Bardsley, Wilson, Shawcross, Pieters, Whelan, Walters, Krkic, Moses, Nzonzi, Crouch, Sorensen, Huth, Adam, Arnautovic, Assaidi, Muniesa, Ireland, Cameron.

Peter Crouch climbed highest to give Stoke all three points against Newcastle on Monday night
