Google faces legal action by European data protection agencies after the American internet giant failed to comply with EU privacy laws.

France's CNIL data protection authority said that the European agencies will meet next week to approve an action plan after Google was warned in October last year that their new privacy policy did not obey EU regulations.

They faced an ultimatum: comply to the instructions of EU agencies within four months or face legal action.

European warning: Google faces legal action by European data protection agencies after the American internet giant failed to follow their instructions to comply with EU privacy laws

Google introduced a new privacy policy in March last year which allowed the company to track users across various services to target advertising.

The changes sparked an outcry from American and European consumer advocacy groups.

The California-based firm argued that the changes simplified and unified its policies across their various services such as Gmail, Android mobile systems, internet search, YouTube and social networking.

Critics argued that the changes give Google, the world’s largest search engine, unprecedented power to track and monitor users. The policy also offers no opt out option other than refraining from using Google services.

Data protection agencies in Europe had suggested Google improve the information provided for users, especially on data being processed and for what purposes and services.

CNIL also asked they provide specific timeframes for holding personal data.

France’s CNIL data protection agency said: ‘At the end of a four month delay accorded to Google to conform and promise to implement recommendations, no response has been forthcoming by the company.’ 

The European Commission supported the agencies’ stance, ‘applauding’ their efforts to ensure data protection laws were followed.

Mina Andreeva, the spokesperson for EU Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding, said: ‘Companies that offer services to consumers in the EU most follow European data protection rules.

‘It is essential that consumers know exactly how their data is processed’ to make informed decisions about using internet-based services.

Google said today that their privacy policy respects European privacy laws.
