A Pennsylvania mother and her boyfriend laughed as they tortured her three-year-old son for weeks by hanging him upside down and hitting him with a frying pan until he died, prosecutors have claimed.

Jillian Tait, 31, and Gary Lee Fellenbaum, 23, were charged Thursday with murdering Tait's son, Scott McMillan in what a district attorney has referred to as 'an American horror story'.  

The pair from Chesco, Pennsylvania, are said to have gone car shopping, bought pizza, had sex and took a nap as Tait's unresponsive three-year-old son lay dying after weeks of relentless torture.

The torment included being beaten with blunt objects, tied to a chair with electrical tape and several punches to the face and stomach. 

When his body was taken to the emergency room, nurses are said to have wept at the sight of his injuries.

'American horror story': Scott McMillan, three, was tortured for weeks and beaten with a frying pan until he eventually died, prosecutors in Pennsylvania have said

Arrested: Jillian Tait, 31, and Gary Lee Fellenbaum, 23, were charged Thursday with murdering Tait's son. Officials said they had sex and went to order pizza as the boy lay dying

They are accused of laughing as the boy was hung upside down and whipped, striking him repeatedly with a frying pan, and eventually beating him to death. 

Chester County District Attorney Thomas Hogan called the sickening accusations 'an American horror story.' 

The abuse had been going on for months, but the beatings and violence intensified between Sunday and Thursday last week.  

Announcing the charges, he said: 'Let me tell you about an American horror story. Little Scotty McMillan is dead.

'Over a three-day period… he was systematically tortured and beaten to death. He was punched in the face and in the stomach, he was scourged with a homemade whip, he was lashed with a metal rod, he was tied to a chair and beaten, he was tied upside down by his feet and beaten, his head was smashed through a wall and at the end of that he had bruises on top of bruises all over his body.'

'When his body went into the emergency room our ER nurses — who see a lot of terrible things — when they saw his body, they wept.'

Holding back tears he said: 'Say a prayer for little Scott McMilan. The brief nightmare that was his life is over.'

Pain: Prosecutors said Scott had gone through weeks of torment, but the torture intensified last week when the youngster refused to eat his breakfast 

Hogan concluded that his team would be seeking the death penalty as the victim was under 12 and there are allegations he had been tortured.  

The couple met working at Wal-Mart and last month moved in together, along with Fellenbaum's estranged wife and three children — Tait's six and three-year-old sons and the Fellenbaums' 11-month-old daughter. 

The six lived in a mobile home park in West Caln Township, Chester County, about 35 miles northwest of Philadelphia. 

The three adults told authorities 'that Scott McMillan had been punched and beaten with blunt and sharp objects, whipped, taped to a chair with electrical tape and beaten, hung up by his feet and beaten, and suffered other acts of violence,' police said in affidavits released Thursday.

Amber Fellenbaum, 21, was charged with child endangerment for allegedly failing to help the toddler. She ultimately called 911 Tuesday night, authorities said. 

By then, Scott had been unresponsive for hours, and had been put in a shower for more than 30 minutes by his mother and her boyfriend, investigators said. 

When the boy failed to awaken, they placed him on an uninflated air mattress and went out shopping, authorities said.

Fellenbaum had severely beaten the boy for refusing to eat toast both Monday and Tuesday morning, authorities said.

The 'discipline' included throwing him against a wall, knocking him off a chair with a punch and then taping him to the chair to keep him upright for more beatings, police said.

It was not immediately clear if any of the adults have lawyers.

Tait told police that she also took part in the abuse and saw the scars on her younger son, court documents said. Her older son also showed signs of abuse, authorities said.

She and Fellenbaum are being held without bail after their arraignments Thursday. They are scheduled for a preliminary hearing on November 14.

When authorities searched their home, they only had one picture of Scott. 

Prosecutors also showed off pictures of the weapons that were used. Included in the items were a makeshift whip, a curtain rod, an aluminum strip and photos of holes in the wall where Fellenbaum slammed Scotty and his 6-year-old brother's heads into the wall, according to NBC Philadelphia. 

On the night that the youngster died, Tait told police that she and Fellenbaum left Scotty on the mattress so he could sleep then went out to pick up pizza for dinner.

At that time, Tait told police that she and Fellenbaum engaged in sexual activity then she took a nap, according to investigators.

After waking up around 7:30 pm Tait said she found Scotty wasn't breathing so she screamed for someone to call 911. Amber Fellenbaum then called 911 and medics arrived. 

Horrific: The couple met working at Wal-Mart and last month moved in together, along with Fellenbaum's estranged wife and three children 

A judge denied bail to both Fellenbaum and Tait at a Wednesday arraignment. 

Hogan announced a total of 16 charges against Gary Fellenbaum including first- and third-degree murder charges, homicide, endangering the welfare of a child, assault and reckless endangerment. Tait faces 15 charges including the most serious murder charges, according to court records. 

According to Chester County's Daily Local News, Fellenbaum picked on the younger boy because he didn't know what was happening and tried to resist. The older boy, who was six, tried not to irritate Fellenbaum any more by struggling. 

In a statement to investigators, Tait admitted that  she participated in the assaults on the brothers. 

An affidavit states: 'During one incident, Gary hung Scott and (his brother) up by their feet one at a time and beat the boys while they were hanging upside down'(Tait) stated the she and Gary were laughing during the incident.'

Scott had been unable to eat the breakfast of toast and cinnamon sugar that Fellenbaum made for him and kept spitting it out. She said she and Fellenbaum tried to force the toast into his mouth but that he still would not eat. Fellenbaum, angry at the child, began punching him in the stomach and face, and took him to his room where the two continued punching him.

At some point, she said, Fellenbaum picked the child up by his back and slammed him into a wall, according to the affidavit.

On Tuesday, when the child woke up he had very red, swolen face. Again he didn't eat breakfast, so Fellenbaum said he was being disrespectful.

He then punched him so hard that the boy fell off of his chair. Fellenbaum then put him back on the chair as he squirmed, took out some electrical tape and tied the boy's feet. 

He also strapped his arms to the posts of the chair so they were elevated. Fellenbaum began punching Scott again, causing him to vomit and become unresponsive, according to the police documents. 

The pair, according to the affadavit, then tried to wake the boy up. Failing to do so they allegedly put him in a bath of ice cold water and changed his closed. 

Fellenbaum is believed to have seen this as another sign of disrespect, so put the boy on the mattress and left the house to go and collect pizza. When they returned he will still unresponsive, so Tait said she ate some of the pizza then had sex with Fellenbaum. 

Hogan added that there had been no warning signs to suggest the boys were being abused. Scott was a student at Rainbow Elementary School, but staff members never reported suspicious bruises or injuries.

However, Scott had been off of school for two weeks.
