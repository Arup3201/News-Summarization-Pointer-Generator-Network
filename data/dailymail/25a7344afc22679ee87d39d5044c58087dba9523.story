Floyd Mayweather's jet-set lifestyle shows no sign of slowing down, as the undefeated boxer flew into France for Paris Fashion week.

The 37-year-old was seen partying with his entourage in the French capital over the weekend, surrounded by his typically imposing security staff.

Mayweather, who earlier this month beat Marcos Maidana in Las Vegas, looked relaxed as he strolled along the famous Champs-Elysees.

The undefeated star grinned as he continued his evening's activities with friends and minders 

Ladies man Mayweather was, as ever, accompanied by beautiful women as he walked through Paris  

Next up for the five-division world champion could be a fight against Manny Pacquiao, although Mayweather has not committed to the bout despite taunting the Filipino fighter on social media. 

The controversial boxer has also been busy dealing with legal matters after he was hauled before regulators in Nevada to explain that the 'reality' TV show promoting the Maidana fight was almost completely made up.

The American posted this montage on Instagram of Manny Pacquiao on the canvas and wrote: 'Miss Pac Man is broke and desperate for a pay day'

Earlier this month Mayweather defeated Marcos Maidana via unanimous decision in Las Vegas

The self-proclaimed 'TBE' (The Best Ever) followed up his appearance at the hearing by posting a picture of himself in bed, listening to music alongside $1million in cash.

And with typical modesty, the boxer commented on his lifestyle, 'Is there such thing as private jet sky mile points?'

The champion  had to explain to boxing regulators last week that his reality TV show was nearly all made up

Mayweather then posted an instagram picture with himself and $1million,  claiming he wants to sell a lifestyle
