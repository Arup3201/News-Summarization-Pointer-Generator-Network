Adel Taarabt has underlined his desire to make his move from QPR to AC Milan a permanent one.

The 24-year-old is on loan at the San Siro but Milan are keen to sign him if Championship promotion hopefuls QPR agree to sell for around £4million.

The Moroccan international arrived in January on loan from QPR after an unsuccessful spell at Fulham and has rediscovered his confidence.

Smiles better: Taarabt wants to stay at AC Milan

'We are in negotiations so that I can stay here and I hope to stay at Milan, as with this jersey I manage to give 100 per cent,' he said.

'I never expected to score so early into my time here. We lost at Napoli, but I think I managed to show straight away who I am,' Taarabt told Milan Channel.

'With this shirt I played for the first time at San Siro and in the Champions League.

'In England I played behind the strikers, but here at Milan I have a different role and I prefer it.'

The Rossoneri remain in the hunt for a Europa League spot thanks to their victory over rivals Inter.

'We only lost against Roma, but won all the other matches, including the derby, so that is very important for the fans,' Taarabt added.

'Now we have to focus on Atalanta and Sassuolo, as it's all still open for Europe and we hope some other results are favourable towards us.'
