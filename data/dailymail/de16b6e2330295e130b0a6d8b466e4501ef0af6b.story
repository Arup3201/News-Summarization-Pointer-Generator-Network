A 16-year-old was today being held on suspicion of attempted murder after three people were shot in woodland close to family homes last night.

The three men are being treated for gunshot wounds, while another two suffered unknown injuries.

Police were scrambled to the woodland after a volley of shots rang out in the trees behind houses in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire.

A father today told how his teenage son had been arrested over the shooting.

'They arrested him in the road,' said the man. They (police) kicked us out of our house and are searching it.'

He
 said his wife and other children were staying with family nearby while 
forensic officers searched their small semi-detached home.

'At the moment all I know is my son has been arrested, I don't know about anyone else,' he said.

He
 added that police had said he may be able to return to his home, where 
he has lived for 14 years, after 7pm this evening, but declined to 
comment further.

The teenager was being held in the police cells while he awaits questioning by senior detectives.

Shocked residents have told how they feared for their childrens’ safety after hearing gunfire during last night's attack.

One neighbour, aged 20, who asked not to be named, said: 'It started out on Underwood Road at about 6pm, I saw a couple of cars and someone came out from the footpath to the woods with a gashed head.

'Then at about 8.20pm I heard two gunshots. A couple of minutes later another went off out the back.

'I looked out to the woods and park and saw a couple of guys and some other people’s heads over the fence. They were Asian lads, in their late teens or early 20s.'

The woman, a mother of one, said she feared for the safety of her young child.

'It was scary seeing the police with guns and dogs, I have never seen anything like that before,' she said.

'The children in the street were petrified, they didn’t know what was going on.'

Police are also hunting for a number of 'outstanding' offenders.

Eight police cars and a van were parked in the residential street, where the footpath through to the woods had been cordoned off as forensics officers in white suits searched the area.

Blood was found at several locations and multiple areas were cordoned off by officers for forensic experts to examine. An address was also being examined as two police stood guard.

A spokesman for Thames Valley Police said officers were called to the disturbance, which is not thought to be a random attack.

He added that the attack was believed to have involved two groups of males but declined to give details of the type of firearm used or the ages of those injured.

Neighbours said the house belonged to a Pakistani family with six children.

Taxi driver Musarat Shah, who lives opposite the address, said: 'I came back from work at about 9pm and the police were all around here with guns, dogs and everything.'

Officers were appealing for anyone who saw anything to contact them.

'Five people were injured, three of whom have been treated for gunshot wounds, none of which are believed to be life threatening,' said the spokesman.

'A number of scenes have been identified as a result of police enquires and one person has been arrested and is in police custody.

'Uniformed officers and forensic teams are deployed at a number of scenes at this time.'

Some locals reported that they heard the two men who were not injured by gunfire were stabbed, although this has not been confirmed.

The investigation was being lead by the Force Criminal Investigations Department, supported by specialist teams and local uniformed officers and PCSOs.

Superintendent Ed McLean said: 'We are in the early stage of a complex investigation and I would like to reassure the community of High Wycombe that we are actively seeking to arrest outstanding offenders.

'It is important to note that this is not believed to be a random shooting.'

A spokesman for South Central Ambulance Service said they treated one man at the scene and he was taken to John Radcliffe Hospital in nearby Oxford.
