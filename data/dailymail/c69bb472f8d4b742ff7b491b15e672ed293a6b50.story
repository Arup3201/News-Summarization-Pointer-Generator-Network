A man had to be rescued after he became impaled on an ornamental headboard in a freak accident in Australia - but it took emergency workers 90 minutes to free him.

Paramedics were called to the 60-year-old man's home in Reid, a suburb of Australian capital Canberra after he became impaled through his stomach.

He was freed by fire crews from the Australian Capital Territory Fire & Rescue service and local police officers - but not before he had been stuck in the agonising position for an hour-and-a-half.

Agony: The freak accident which saw a 60-year-old man impaled through the stomach on an ornamental headboard happened in the Reid suburb of Canberra, Australia

He was rushed to Canberra Hospital where he is said to be in a serious but stable condition following the incident which happened on Sunday.

It is unclear how the man came to be impaled on the headboard.

The Australian man is not the only one who had a lucky escape after becoming impaled in an accident in 2012.

Earlier this month a Chinese man who tried to use a hydraulic pressure spindle to barbecue a sheep ended up with a metal bar impaled through his abdomen when it exploded.

It took two hours of surgery to remove the bar from the man's stomach.

Also in December, another Chinese man almost blinded himself in one eye after impaling it on a giant metal hook.Â 

Wang Chenggen was using the rusty hook to pick up rubbish when he slipped and fell face first onto it.

The bizarre accident happened in Harbin, in China's Heilongjiang Province.

Meanwhile, closer to home in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, a pensioner was impaled through the chest on a metal table leg and had to be freed by firefighters.
