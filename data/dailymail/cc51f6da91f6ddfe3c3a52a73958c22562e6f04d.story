Smuggling, risking smokers’ health and denying the Treasury much-needed cash, are just a few of the consequences if cigarette packets are stripped of branding, a Tory MP warned today.

Health Secretary Andrew Lansley has paved the way for the Government to force tobacco firms to provide all cigarettes in plain packets in a bid to cut smoking.

The coalition’s public consultation on plain packaging will launch on Monday - it follows a new law introduced last week which means all large shops and supermarkets must cover up cigarettes and hide tobacco products from public view.

Plain future: Health Secretary Andrew Lansley today paved the way for the Government to force tobacco firms to provide all cigarettes in plain packets in a bid to cut smoking

Mr Lansley said he was 'open-minded' about the consultation, but added: 'We don’t work in partnership with the tobacco companies because we are trying to arrive at a point where they have no business in this country.'

Such a ban would be the latest attack on smoking after previous governments banned tobacco companies describing certain brands of cigarettes as 'lights', outlawed sponsorship deals and forced firms to publish on packets graphic, gruesome images of cancerous organs and stark warnings about the potential health effects of lighting up.

But Conservative MP Mark Field said today: 'The enforced introduction of plain packaging would infringe fundamental legal rights routinely afforded to international business, erode British intellectual property and brand equity and would create a dangerous precedent for the future of commercial free speech.

Opposition: Health Secretary Andrew Lansley, left, today paved the way plain cigarette packets in a bid to cut smoking, but Conservative MP Mark Field, right, said it could 'result in other sorts of negative impacts'

'I suspect plain packaging will result in other sorts of negative impacts, including the increased health threat posed by counterfeit tobacco, the encouragement of smuggled products and damaging competition.

'Indeed, the Treasury is already losing around £3 billion a year from tobacco that has evaded UK duty; criminal gangs operating a contraband supply chain at the expense of legitimate businesses.

'All of this could result in a potential loss of investment and jobs that goes way beyond the tobacco manufacturing sector.'

He said tobacco was 'already one of the most highly regulated products in the world', adding: 'The introduction of plain packaging would most certainly amount to a regulation too far and the so-called ‘denormalisation’ of tobacco is not a sufficiently valid policy decision to justify such action.'

But opposition to the plain packaging plan continues to grow with the Association of Convenience Stores, which represents Britain's corner shops, vowing to fight the proposal.

Chief executive James Lowman said: 'The confusion that this would create would create further regulatory burdens on thousands of businesses.

'If every tobacco product looks the same it will be much harder for retailers and their staff to locate products on the shelf. This will slow down service times, affect customer service and make stock management harder. We will provide further details of retail costs to the consultation.'

Pro-smoking group the Freedom Organisation for the Right to Enjoy Smoking Tobacco (Forest), has launched a Hands Off Our Packs campaign.

Director Simon Clark has described plain packaging as 'the persecution of a minority lifestyle choice'.

He said: 'Plain packaging is yet another attack on retailers and adult consumers.

'People are sick of being nannied by government.'

And the International Chamber of Commerce claimed the plan could breach World Trade Organisation rules.

policy director Andrew Wilson said: 'It remains unclear as to whether 
plain packaging is compatible with a number of the UK’s international 
trade commitments, including important WTO intellectual property 
agreements.

'With protectionism on the rise, this is not the time for the UK to be testing the limits of international trade law.

'What might be viewed as a justifiable measure in narrow terms, could set a precedent which would be hugely damaging to global trade.'

Chancellor George Osborne announced in last month’s Budget that the price of a packet of 20 cigarettes would rise by 37p to an average of £7.36 and Mr Lansley’s latest comments came a week after a ban on tobacco promotion in England was introduced.

New laws mean all large shops and supermarkets must cover up cigarettes and hide tobacco products from public view.

First taste: More than 300,000 children under 16 try smoking each year and 5 per cent of children aged 11 to 15 are regular smokers, according to its figures

The Department of Health said the move was in response to evidence that cigarette displays in shops can encourage young people to take up the habit.

More than 300,000 children under 16 try smoking each year and 5 per cent of children aged 11 to 15 are regular smokers, according to its figures.

Meanwhile 39 per cent of smokers say that they were smoking regularly before the age of 16.

Deborah Arnott, chief executive of campaigning charity Action on Smoking and Health (Ash), welcomed the plan, saying:

'Now that cigarette advertising, promotion and sponsorship and tobacco displays have all been banned this is the obvious next step if the Government truly wants to make smoking history.

'Cigarettes are not like sweets or toys and should not be sold in fancy colourful packaging which makes them appealing to children.

The British Heart Foundation’s policy director Betty McBride said: 'Tobacco advertising is rightly banned in the UK, yet current glitzy packaging clearly still advertises tobacco on the cigarette box.

'It’s an absurd loophole the tobacco industry takes full advantage of to lure in new young smokers.'

Last year, Australia approved laws to introduce plain packaging to reduce the attractions of smoking, but three global tobacco giants launched lawsuits saying the rules infringed trademark rights.

Three of the world’s four largest tobacco groups, Philip Morris International, British American Tobacco and Imperial Tobacco are challenging the new law in the High Court.
