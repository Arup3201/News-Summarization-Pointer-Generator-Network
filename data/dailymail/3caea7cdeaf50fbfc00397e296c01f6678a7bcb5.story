A cruel mother is facing up to three years in jail for treating two of her children ‘like dogs’ and locking them in bedrooms so cold they got frostbite.

Linda Clappison, 46, routinely locked her son and daughter in a dark room with no bedding and pushed them close to starvation on a diet of chocolate-spread sandwiches while cooking hot food for herself, a court heard.

She sent them to work with gypsies on market stalls where they were exploited working up to 12 hours a day.

The mum-of-four terrorised her youngest children for five years using strangulation and cold baths for punishment.

She removed her son’s mattress after 
finding him cowering for warmth and humiliated her daughter at school by
 forcefully shaving her head five times then made her say she did it 
herself to look like Britney Spears.

Judge Michael Mettyear said she had 
shown no remorse for her actions and told her: 'There is something 
wrong. Why you cannot see you have lovely children that most people 
would be proud of I do not know. You have put yourself and others in 
front of their needs I do not think you will co-operate with the 
probation service. You will tell the same lies that you have told the 
jury.

‘You seem devoid of any compassion for these children or remorse for what you have done.'

He adjourned for a probation report before sentence and added 'a custodial sentence is inevitable. So it is best to start it.'

A jury found Clappison of Keyingham, 
East Yorkshire, guilty of two charges of cruelty to her daughter, now 
13, from ages six to ten and her son over five years until 2010.

The case came to light after the girl went to school one day and told teachers she did not want to go home to her mum.

Clappison had already fooled a social 
services inspection after the girl turned up at school with a black eye.
 She undid the locks, put the children’s toys downstairs and made it 
look like happy families when a social worker called.

Andrew Clappison, 18, said his mother 
Linda kept him off school more than he went, sending him to working for 
gypsies on market stalls after she became infatuated with a gypsy 
fortune teller.

He told a jury at Hull Crown Court she
 changed from being a loving and caring mother-of-four after his father 
left home at the age of ten when his mother had an affair.

She began spending most of her time 
with palm reader Liz Smith and went 'mental' leaving her children with 
her family. She would remain at the Smiths home while the children 
worked for the gypsies.

Clappison never went to the children’s
 parents’ evenings at school and would leave her daughter up to two 
hours after school finished waiting in the playground. She refused to 
meet with Education Welfare Officers and claimed her children - who fell
 behind at school - were doing well. Relatives were shocked at how thin 
they were.

Andrew Clappison said he began to be 
locked in his room routinely at night straight after school, eating with
 no light bulb and no heating. He said he would have to work for 
travellers during the day often falsely getting the blame for things 
which went wrong with their families.

He said his mother punched, slapped 
and kicked him once taking a leather belt to his bottom and once banging
 his head against the wall. His worst punishment was being given a cold 
bath with his mother holding him under.

He said he struggled to hold on to the taps but his mother dug her nails into his veins to force him to let go.

Andrew Clappison, 18, told a jury at Hull Crown Court that he was 'scared' of his 'evil' mother who he alleges stopped him going from school and forced him to work on a gypsy market stall

He told a jury: 'I was locked up in my bedroom every time I was a home. I was not able to walk the house.'

'I was scared of her. I had to have my
 tea in my room. She would not let me come downstairs. When I wanted to 
go to the toilet, I had to ask by knocking on the door and asking to 
leave. It was the same if I wanted a drink of water. I was treated like a
 dog basically.'

He denied claims being locked up was 
rare, but said it was routine and said he once smashed his way out, only
 for his mother to fit a new lock.

He said in January 2010 his mother 
removed his bed and blankets from his bedroom making him sleep dressed 
only in underpants and he got frost bite. He said his mother removed the
 mattress when she caught him trying to keep warm underneath it.

He said: 'I was sleeping in the cold 
all the time. The boiler was working because it was in my room but I had
 no radiator. I used to wake up with blue feet I was that sick. My feet 
got frost bite.'

He was treated for frost bite in all 
of his toes on his left foot and his big toe on his right foot at 
hospital. He said his mother told him to say he had been playing outside
 in the cold.

Crown barrister Mark McKone said 
Andrew Clappison’s attendance at school fell to 43 per cent. He said 
despite requests for her to attend school Mrs Clappison never answered 
the phone and Andrew Clappison never went on school trips.

Andrew Clappison said at Christmas his only presents were chocolate and his clothes were gypsy hand-me downs.

Clappison faces between three and four years in prison. The judge will sentence in May.
