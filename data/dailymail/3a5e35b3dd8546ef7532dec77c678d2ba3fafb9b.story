A 17-year-old high school student on Spring break and her aunt were found dead, floating in western Lake Erie Thursday morning after they never returned home from a fishing trip.

Searchers found a partially submerged boat on a reef near the Davis-Besse nuclear power plant and later spotted the bodies of 33-year-old Amy Santus and her niece Paige Widmer wearing life jackets, authorities said.

The two went out on the lake Wednesday afternoon for a fishing trip with two men and even sent pictures on the boat back to relatives.

But when the group didn't return home that night as planned, family reported them missing.

The search for the fishing party started around 2am Thursday, and the 21-foot-long boat was found miles from shore around 6:30am. The bodies of the two women were found a few hours later.

Coast Guard continued to search for the two other men reported missing by boat and helicopter for the rest of the day, but called off the search Thursday night due to water conditions.

While the two men have not yet been named by officials, one of the men has been identified as 33-year-old Andrew Rose of Maumee, in the Toledo Blade.

Christopher Titus, a friend of Mr Rose, says he learned about his friend's disappearance late Wednesday and says Mr Rose was a close friend of Amy Santus.

Mr Rose is a bartender at Home Slice Pizza in Toledo, Mr Titus said.

'He lived to be outside. If he wasn't on the water he was hunting,' Mr. Titus said. 'I am sorry to hear what happened to Andrew and the others. My thoughts and prayers are with their families.'

The average water temperature within the search area was about 35 to 40 degrees, the Coast Guard said. How long people can survive in water that cold depends on their weight, gender and what they were wearing.

Authorities narrowed the search to an area about 30 miles east of Toledo after finding the boat. They continued to search for the two men today, even though their survival window in the water is only about 8 hours.

'If these people were still findable our forces would have found them by now,' a search official said Thursday.

The cause of the boat accident has not yet been determined since the focus has been at finding the missing passengers.

Officials don't believe alcohol was a factor.Â 

A cause of death for the two women has not been released either.

The boaters' truck and boat trailer were found at a marina where they headed out on the lake.

Paige Widmer was from Pelion, South Carolina and was visiting family in the area for her Spring break.

She played varsity volleyball for her high school, and classmates gathered Thursday afternoon to hold a vigil in her honor.
