The lights have gone up, the annual battle of the sentimental television adverts has started, and the invitations to parties are flooding in. 

The Christmas season is well and truly underway, and adding fuel to the festive spirit is of course the markets popping up in cities across Europe, and all over the world.

There are few things more merry than sipping mulled wine in a traditional market with twinkling lights and carols playing while browsing for gifts for loved ones.

Season's greetings: The festive season is here, meaning Christmas markets are popping up all over the world

With this in mind, travel comparison website Dealchecker.co.uk has compiled a list of traditional - and some not so traditional - Christmas markets.

Called 'The 12 Markets of Christmas, this infographic rounds up the best of the European festivals, from the big classic in Cologne to Liseberg's charming family-friendly one with real reindeer.

But there are some events around the world that put a twist on the traditional market - whether it's a medieval fayre in Wales or a market and parade sponsored by fast-food giant McDonald's in Chicago.

12 of the best... and weirdest: The infographic rounds up six traditional markets such as Liseberg (pictured)

... and six not so traditional, such as Hamburg's erotica market, Santa Pauli

Perhaps the most eyebrow-raising offering is in Hamburg, a city known for its traditional Christmas markets.

Nicknamed 'Germany's most frivolous Christmas market', the erotica-themed Santa Pauli market features sex shows, porn karaoke, and stands selling sensual gifts.
