Border Force officials are investigating former staff at a scandal-hit care home, it was revealed yesterday.

They were called in to Merok Park in Surrey after it was closed without notice following an inspection and the elderly residents moved.

One 85-year-old man died within hours. But his death has been shrouded in secrecy with officials refusing to release his name.

Members of the Home Office’s immigration law enforcement command are investigating whether staff at Merok Park, in Banstead, were working in Britain illegally. A spokesman for the Home Office said: ‘We take all allegations of illegal working seriously and will take action where we find it.’

The scandal surrounding Merok Park broke on December 11 when it was shut by inspectors who found 26 elderly and vulnerable residents living in appalling conditions. They were moved by ambulance, still in their pyjamas, on a bitterly cold night. The 85-year-old man was taken to a nearby nursing home but died within 48 hours.

As the Daily Mail reported yesterday, his death has been cloaked in official secrecy, with the Surrey coroner, the registration officer, police, the county council and the local NHS trust all refusing even to release the man’s name.

Guildford register office said it could not name the pensioner because of data protection rules – even though these do not apply to the dead. Yesterday Government sources signalled that ministers are unhappy with this failure to comply with the principle that deaths must be publicly recorded.

One said: ‘There is never any issue about releasing the names of people who die in tragic circumstances. So this case looks like using data protection for purposes that were never intended. Common sense should be applied. The sense of secrecy will just make a sad and distressing situation worse.’

While the secrecy row continued yesterday, the involvement of Border Force officials at Merok Park was disclosed by one of the three councils who used the care home and whose social workers have been dealing with the aftermath of the sudden shutdown.

Sutton council, which was paying £500 a week for each of its six residents, said it was co-operating with the Border Force, police and the Care Quality Commission in an inquiry which features ‘significant interest’ in the way Merok Park was run. A council spokesman added: ‘We don’t believe this is the end of the matter.’

The closure of Merok Park came after CQC inspectors found an ‘overpowering’ smell of urine, patients forced to wash in cold water and a broken lift which effectively imprisoned some on the top floor of the building.

They were also concerned that the home was employing untrained staff. Some had neither passed police checks nor received relevant training and were working up to 60 hours a week.

Sutton council said it had raised concerns about two other homes in the borough operated by the owners of Merok Park: Grantley Court and Faygate House. Grantley Court has also since been closed while Faygate House – a residential home rather than a nursing home – remains open under the supervision of the CQC and social workers.

All three homes were run by Mauritian businessman Soondressen Cooppen, 51, and his wife Maleenee, 42.

The couple, who live in a £2million house in Cheam, are thought to have been earning £650,000 a year from each.

Surrey Police said officers are working with a CQC board which is considering the Merok Park affair but there is no separate police investigation.
