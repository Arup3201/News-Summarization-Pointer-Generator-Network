It appears Mamadou Sakho is a man of many talents following his latest hint at another career move after he hangs up his football boots.

After last week's attempts at making the France RBS 6 Nations squad, against Tottenham and then in training, the defender then tried his hand at painting and decorating for two charities.

However, the 25-year-old has literally tried his hands at becoming a physio after giving Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard an apparent rub down at the club's training ground on Tuesday afternoon.

Gerrard uploaded the picture of Sakho in action working on his injured hamstring via his Instagram account.

Accompanied with the caption 'Getting some help with my rehab @mamadousakho3 #onedaycloser' Sakho can be seen 'aiding' his team-mates recovery on the treatment.

Gerrard, who suffered the injury in last week's 3-2 at Tottenham, missed the Reds FA Cup fifth round victory at Crystal Palace on Saturday.

The 34-year-old will also be unavailable for their Europa League Round of 32 first leg clash at home to Besiktas on Thursday.
