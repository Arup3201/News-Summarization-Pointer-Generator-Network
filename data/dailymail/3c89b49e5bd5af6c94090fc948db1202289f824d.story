If you have trouble coping with a spider in your bath, be glad you don't live in the Xishuangbanna tropical rainforest in China.

Scientists have recently identified 30 new species of arachnid in less than a square mile of the mysterious forest in the southern part of Yunnan.

And they believe many more are yet to be discovered in the biodiversity hotspot - called Mengbanaxi in ancient times, meaning a 'miraculous utopia' and also known as 'the Kingdom of Tropical Fauna and Flora'.

Many more spider species are yet to be discovered in the biodiversity hotspot of Xishuangbanna, according to the team from the Institute of Zoology with the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Above, Capsulia laciniosa

The spiders (including Cirrosus atrocaudatus, pictured) were found in an area called Huludao. Although it covers only about 200 hectares of Xishuangbanna, Huludao has yielded a collection of approximately 700 spider species

The team, from the Institute of Zoology with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, have warned that the find highlights how many undiscovered creatures are being lost to the world for ever, due to the destruction of the rainforests for logging and farming. 

Professor Shuqiang Li, of the academy, based in Beijing, said: 'The amazing biological diversity we have witnessed during our work on spiders in the area is perhaps only a part of what Xishuangbanna tropical rainforests hold.'

It is one of the few places in China that still maintains large tracts of tropical rainforest, and Prof Li and colleagues have been using multiple collecting methods there since 2006.

The spiders were found in an area called Huludao which, although covering only about 200 hectares of Xishuangbanna, has yielded a collection of approximately 700 spider species. 

The site of the spider find (above) was called Mengbanaxi in ancient times, meaning a 'miraculous utopia' and is now known as 'the Kingdom of Tropical Fauna and Flora'

Prof Li said there are another 100 new ones to be published soon.

The team has published findings on about 250 new spider species, with the 30 currently described in ZooKeys being a part of their ongoing work.

Prof Li added: 'Studying the flora and fauna in biodiversity hotspots like these attests to the importance of their preservations, and gives a sad insight of what was lost with the destruction of forests elsewhere.'

In the 1940s and 1950s, China's Xishuangbanna region was a remote tropical rainforest, China's only one.

Since then the government and people of Xishuangbanna have begun a completely devastating assault on the environment. 

Slash and burn agriculture, and wholesale destruction of the tropical rainforest, has lifted much of the region out of abject poverty, but at a serious cost.

Today Xishuangbanna is a shadow of its former self. 

New highways, tea plantations, rubber tree plantations and sugar cane dominate the landscape. 

Rainforests once covered 14 per cent of the earth's land surface. 

Now they cover a mere 6 per cent and experts estimate the last remaining could be consumed in less than 40 years.

Nearly half of the world's species of plants, animals and micro-organisms will be destroyed or severely threatened over the next quarter century due to the deforestation.

It is estimated we are losing 137 plant, animal and insect species every single day, which amounts to 50,000 a year. 

As the rainforest species disappear, so do many possible cures for life-threatening diseases.

Currently, 121 prescription drugs sold worldwide come from plant-derived sources. 

While 25 per cent of Western pharmaceuticals are derived from rainforest ingredients, less that 1 per cent of these tropical trees and plants have been tested by scientists.
