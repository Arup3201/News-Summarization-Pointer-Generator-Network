In a bid to steal Apple’s thunder this week, Samsung has created a series of adverts mocking the new iPhone features.

The collection, titled ‘It Doesn’t Take a Genius’ – which makes reference to Apple’s in-store Genius bars - features two employees moaning about the new devices, while promoting the features of the Galaxy Note 4.

One video also mocks the fact Apple’s live stream crashed on Tuesday.

In a bid to steal Apple’s thunder this week, Samsung has created a series of adverts mocking the new iPhone features, while promoting some of its own. The collection, titled ‘It Doesn’t Take a Genius’ – which makes reference to Apple’s in-store Genius bars – features two employees moaning about the new devices (pictured)

Each of the adverts have been designed to promote Samsung’s Galaxy Note 4 device, which was unveiled at last week’s IFA event in Berlin.

The first video in the collection shows one of the employees stuttering and freezing, to make reference to the fact Apple’s live stream failed repeatedly during the launch event on Tuesday.

In the advert, his colleague exclaims: ‘You can’t handle a live stream? You work in technology. Unbelievable.’

A second advert mocks the larger screen. 

The employees are shown watching the live stream. 

One says: ‘We’ve been waiting two years for us to do something groundbreaking. Here it is. A bigger screen,’ to which the other responds: ‘Wait. A bigger screen? Every other phone has a bigger screen.’

The battery life of the iPhone is also ridiculed, (screengrab pictured) compared to the faster charging capacity of the Note 4, as is the iPhone’s fragility. Another advert sees the employees struggling to draw on the devices without a stylus pen, while a third mocks the lack of multiple windows – both features of the Galaxy Note 4

And in the final advert, the employees discuss the Apple Watch and make reference to the fact Samsung already has a range of smart wearables, with its Galaxy Note 4 and Gear S.  

Following Apple’s announcement on Tuesday, Google+ user Ron Amadeo similarly created a graphic designed to highlight the iPhone 6’s new features that have been on Android devices for years.

Samsung’s Galaxy Note 4 (pictured) was unveiled at last week’s IFA event in Berlin It is available to pre-order later this month. It has a 5.7-inch screen, 16MP camera, S pen stylus and multi window functionality

Entitled ‘Dear iPhone 6 users: Welcome to 2012’, these features included a larger screen, NFC, and third-party keyboards.

Despite the criticisms of the products, however, demand for pre-orders of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus was so high it caused Apple’s site to crash.

It also crashed the sites of network operators EE and O2, which are also offering the devices to pre-order.
