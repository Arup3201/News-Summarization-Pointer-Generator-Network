Poland's government has come under fire for letting 5,000 Russian football fans celebrate their national day marking the end of the 
Soviet Union with a patriotic march through Warsaw.

The nation's police has also been slammed for being too slow to react to the violence that erupted during the parade, which came ahead of Russia and Poland's 1-1 Euro 2012 draw.

Ugly rioting saw 184 arrested, including 156 Poles and 24 Russians, and at least another 24 injured.

Aggravation: Polish and Russia fans kick off against each other after the match in Warsaw last night

Battering: Punches, bottles and missiles were thrown despite the attention of 6,000 officers

Angry: Despite the clashes, Poland's government has said it was happy with the number of police who were on patrol

Tension: Russia and Poland have a problematic history, which manifested in last night's violence

But Interior Minister Jacek Cichocki insisted that the 6,400 police, including 2,000 riot officers, sent to deal with 
the march to the stadium was sufficient.

He told a news conference today: 'In my opinion, the number of policemen was appropriate. I think the police performed well.'

And he said he hoped the courts would severely punish all those caught fighting in the streets of the Polish capital.

He added: 'When it comes to our 
hooligans, I hope the prosecutors and especially the courts will be 
strict and these people will fully feel the consequences of their 
antics.'

Cichocki also said the detained Russians 
would face accelerated court procedure and would likely be expelled from
 Poland and banned from returning to Europe's border free Schengen area 
for five years.   

Many have questioned why the march 
was allowed in the first place, likening it to England fans marching 
through a German city to celebrate D-Day.

Authorities had been braced for a confrontation at the Group A game between the neighbouring countries.

Relations have been poisoned by 
centuries of conflict and the Soviet domination of Poland for more than 
four decades after World War Two.   

It has tarnished what has so far been a relatively tarnished tournament, with UEFA also being criticised for staging the game on such an emotive day.

Police fired rubber bullets and used 
water cannons on the hooligans who fought running battles in the streets 
of the Polish capital.

Despite it marking Russia's breakaway
 from the USSR, the Russia Day marchers were waving Soviet flags – a 
provocative symbol to many Poles, who were controlled from Moscow for 
decades.

Fans inside the ground unfurled a 
huge banner proclaiming 'This Is Russia' - another antagonistic reference 
to the former Soviet control.

Punches, bottles and missiles were 
thrown. The Poles are said to 
have used a bridge to ambush their rivals.

'It was just a free for all and a 
disgrace,’ said one eyewitness. 'Innocent people were running and 
screaming just to get away from these men who behaved like animals.

'They were kicking out at each other, in the face and the body as they lay on the ground.’

In a separate incident, around 50 Polish fans wearing masks attacked Russian rivals in a Warsaw cafe.

Russia Day, the national holiday of the Russian Federation, has been celebrated on June 12 every year since 1992.

The First Congress of People's Deputies of the Russian Federation adopted the Declaration of State Sovereignty of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic on June 12, 1990.

The creation of the Presidency, the adoption of the new Russian Constitution, flag, anthem and emblem were major landmarks in the consolidation of Russian statehood.

The day when the declaration was adopted- June 12 - was proclaimed as national holiday by Supreme Soviet of Russia in 1992.

Russia's first President, Boris Yeltsin, was also elected on the same day in 1991.

Edyta Galazkowska, spokesman for Warsaw ambulance service, said 14 Russians, one German, one U.S. citizen and one Pakistani were among the injured.

The nationality of seven others was being established. None was in life-threatening condition.

A Warsaw police spokesman added: 'We are still monitoring the situation and trying to identify the supporters involved.

'The operation is not over from our side as we continue in our attempts to catch those who are causing trouble.'

Tensions were already running high with home fans having mocked the Russians over a Polish army victory in 1920.

The two countries are uneasy 
neighbours with Russia having occupied Poland for more than a century 
and dominating the country after the Second World War.

Football governing body UEFA has 
already begun disciplinary proceedings against Russian fans caught on 
film kicking and punching stewards near a walkway at the Wroclaw stadium
 after their side beat the Czech Republic 4-1.

There were a number of other incidents as well, which came as Russia fans waving their country's flag marched to the stadium in a show of patriotism seen as provocative to many Poles.

It was considered a huge security challenge for police. Russia fans clashed with police on a bridge near the National Stadium and police were later seen making arrests.

In another incident, a group of clearly drunken Polish men began fighting among themselves, hitting and kicking each other.

Two were on the ground bleeding and police intervened, throwing two more to the ground.

The men were holding cans of beer and mumbling and one appeared to be unconscious. An AP reporter witnessed the incident and saw police detain three people.

One Russian who didn't have tickets to the game, but made the two-day car trip from Moscow simply to be in be the city, said it was wrong for the Russians to march in Warsaw given the countries' troubled history.

'The march, it wasn't right. It was a
 provocation. It shouldn't happen like this. But there are also 
aggressive Poles and we are scared here,' said the man, who gave only 
his first name, Petya.

He 
and a friend had hoped to cross a bridge leading from the city center to
 the stadium to soak up the atmosphere in the area.

But they gave up 
that notion and were sitting outside, sipping on beers from a distance, 
and planning to watch the match on TV in an apartment with friends.

In
 recent days, Polish media have tried to stir up nationalistic 
sentiments over the match, suggesting the encounter would be more than a
 simple soccer game.

Newspapers
 on Monday were full of dramatic references to Poland's victorious 1920 
battle against the Bolshevik Army, known as the Miracle on the Vistula.

The
 Super Express tabloid carried a front page mocked-up picture of Poland 
coach Franciszek Smuda charging on horseback, saber in hand, in a 1920 
Polish army uniform under the headline "Faith, Hope, Smuda" - a play on 
an old army motto: "Faith, Hope, Motherland."
