Anis Ben-Hatira used his super powers for good after the Hertha Berlin striker celebrated scoring against Schalke by donning a Spiderman mask in support of an eight-year-old fan battling cancer.

The Tunisia international netted the opener in his side's 2-2 draw in the Bundesliga on Saturday before racing to the bench to retrieve the mask and pointing out young Jannik in the crowd.

Ben-Hatira has been visiting the stricken youngster at a Berlin hospital since October when the pair made a pact shared on his Instagram account, which also includes pictures of the two wearing super hero masks.

He said: 'We decided to fight against his illness together. In such moments I realise: a healthy person has 1,000 desires. A sick person just one. 

'Cute guy: you promised me to recover and I promised to stay on your side during the chemotherapy. I will visit you regularly.

'In less than six months we will stand in front of the fans at the Olympic stadium and celebrate your recovery.'

While Ben-Hatira was cautioned for his celebration, Jannik received a rapturous response from the crowd before being allowed on the pitch to meet some of his own heroes.
