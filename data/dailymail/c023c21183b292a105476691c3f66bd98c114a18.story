Tottenham were prepared to use top goalscorer Nacer Chadli as a makeweight in their attempts to land Morgan Schneiderlin in the summer.

Chadli has been a huge plus point during a largely mediocre season so far for Spurs, scoring six goals.

But the Belgium international could easily have departed White Hart Lane earlier this year had things panned out differently.

Nacer Chadli could have been offered to Southampton in exchange for Morgan Scneiderlin

Tottenham were desperate to sign the French midfielder, but he remained with the Saints and has impressed

Mauricio Pochettino was desperate to land Schneiderlin from former club Southampton during the summer transfer window.

And the Spurs boss tried to use Chadli as bait to convince the Saints to part with their France international.

At the time Chadli was unsure of what his role would be under Pochettino.

Speaking last month, he said: 'There were some interesting offers this summer, but I wanted to stay at Spurs. I wanted to fight for my place because I know I have a lot of beautiful things to show.

Maurico Pochettino has been boosted by the fact Chadli has been on form this season, top scoring for Spurs

'I'm a warrior. Someone who wants to fight for his chance. In the beginning it wasn't easy for me. I was one of the players Pochettino hadn't invited for an individual meeting. So I didn't really know what to expect.

'But I've reacted by working hard during the week. I grabbed my chance during a [UEFA] Europa League game in Cyprus, where I came in 20 minutes before the end of the game.

'The next game, against QPR, I scored twice and since then I'd always play.'
