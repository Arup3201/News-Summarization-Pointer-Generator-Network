One of Britain’s most high-profile fashion bosses has quit her job at the age of 56 – prompting an ageism row.

Kate Bostock walked out of fashion giant Asos earlier this week after just seven months as director of product.

Explaining her departure founder Nick Robertson said: ‘Strategy wasn’t the issue. It was more about cultural fit and time of life.’

And in what some are calling an 
admission of discrimination, the 44-year-old added: ‘Our average age is 
27 or 28. People get to a stage in their career where they’re either up 
for a very big challenge or they’re not.’

One headhunter who specialises in recruiting retail executives said she was appalled by Mr Robertson’s comment.

‘It’s an absolute ageist comment that 
was directed at Kate because she was a woman,’ said Moira Benigson, 
managing partner of executive search group MBS.

‘If the job had gone to a
man of the same calibre would people have said that?

‘They are suggesting she is past her 
sell-by date, so when’s the cut off? Is it when menopause starts? Asos 
will have to behave like a mature business someday, but it is still 
young and entrepreneurial.’

Brief stint: Nick Robertson, chief executive of Asos, said he was 'disappointed that things haven't worked out' as Ms Bostock's departure was announced

Kate Bostock's career trajectory has seen her work her way up from a design role at a now defunct knitwear manufacturer in the East Midlands to become a key player at some of the biggest names in British retail.

Fresh out of fashion college in Derby, Bostock secured a position at the now dissolved clothing manufacturer Klynton Davies, before moving on to Bent & Son, party plan firm Pippa Dee and Charnwood Designs.

She joined high street staple Next in 1995, where she would remain as director of kidswear until 2001 when she moved to Asda as product director for the supermarket giant's George clothing brand.

She spent three years at Asda before being hired by Marks & Spencer in 2004, where she rose to become executive director of general merchandise on a package worth almost £1m.

Last July Marks & Spencer reported dismal quarterly figures and announced that Ms Bostock would be leaving as head of clothing as part of a management shake-up. She stepped down from the board in October 2012.

Online retailer Asos set about courting Ms Bostock and she took up a position as director of product and trading in January 2013 in what was widely hailed as a major coup for the firm.

The 56-year-old's latest post came with an undisclosed salary that reportedly represented a cut on what she was earning at rival retailer Marks & Spencer.

On Tuesday, after just seven months at Asos, it was announced that Ms Bostock had quit after agreeing with chief executive Nick Robertson the firm was 'not the right platform for her talent'.

Miss Bostock said simply: ‘Sadly I’ve 
concluded that Asos is not the right place for me.’

Announcing Miss 
Bostock’s departure on Monday, multimillionaire retail tycoon Mr 
Robertson said: ‘Kate and I have agreed that Asos is not the right 
platform for her talent.

'Of course we are disappointed that things 
haven’t worked out and Kate leaves with our very best wishes.’

He was reported as saying: ‘I’d love 
to say it was more sinister and complicated, but she gave it six months 
and decided it wasn’t for her’.

Insiders said that while it was Miss 
Bostock’s decision to leave, it was potentially driven by something of a
culture clash.

She joined Asos after last year 
leaving Marks & Spencer, where she was considered the queen of 
fashion, having risen to run its clothing business.

Marks & Spencer is traditional in 
its approach to retailing and its products are aimed at a broader church
of shoppers whereas Asos is aimed at 20-somethings, with an internet 
focus.

Previously she had worked at Next, which she joined in 1995, 
working her way up to director of childrenswear before moving to Asda in
2001, where she worked as product director for its George clothing 
brand.

Her experience meant she was regarded as one of the key voices in the fashion retail world.

She was brought in as Asos retail 
director on an undisclosed salary after Mr Robertson said he had wanted 
to appoint a ‘big retail hitter to take the business on to the next 
level’.

One retail executive said: ‘It was 
never going to be a marriage made in heaven – she’s hardcore and he’s 
king of flying by the seat of his pants.’

Asos, which stands for As Seen On 
Screen, started life in 2000 marketing copies of clothes worn by famous 
people.

It now sells a wide range of clothing, from high street names to
high-end fashion.

It is also running a trial selling items for Primark, which has no other online presence.

Mr Robertson has grown Asos into a £3.6bn business, in which he has a 9.4 per cent stake, currently worth £345million.

Back in 2000, a website called As Seen On Screen launched to little fanfare. Marketing copies of clothes worn by famous women to celebrity-obsessed girls, the site was manned by a staff of just three.

Thirteen years and an abbreviated title later, Asos is now a global retail phenomenon that employs staff in Australia, the U.S., France and Germany and attracts in excess of 20million internet shoppers every month.

The website offers fashion-conscious 20 and 30-somethings instant access to thousands of items from a vast array of major brands - along with its own creations following the launch of the Asos Own label for women in 2004.

In 2010 came the launch of Asos 
Marketplace, a treasure trove of vintage fashion where users can browse 
the wares of small boutique brands or sell their own creations.

Having well and truly shed its early reputation as a purveyor of rip-off versions of celebrity outfits, Asos is now a one-stop destination for everything from the high street to high end, with River Island or Zara dresses, vintage gems, and premium brands like Current Elliott or Equipment separated by just a few clicks of a mouse.

Having this year opened new international offices in Lille and Munich, the retailer's spectacular growth shows no sign of slowing down. Asos reported a remarkable 45 per cent rise in sales to £194million in the three months to May 31, compared with the same period in 2012.

And while its offering has expanded over the years to include designer diffusion lines and edgier, more expensive brands alongside its high street lines, the retailer's commitment to fast, affordable fashion was evident in its decision to feature items from Primark for a trial period last month.

The decision to team up with the discount clothing store appears to have been welcomed by Asos' ever-expanding customer base, as chief executive Nick Robertson described the response to the Primark trial as 'phenomenal'.
