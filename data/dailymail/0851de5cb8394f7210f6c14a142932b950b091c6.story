Israeli police clashed with hundreds of Palestinian protesters in Jerusalem as an Arab teenager, who Palestinians say was killed by Israeli extremists, was buried in the neighbourhood where he lived.

Mohammed Abu Khder, 16, who was kidnapped and found dead on Wednesday, was buried in east Jerusalem after the midday prayers, with tensions running high after two straight days of violence.

Thousands of people chanting and waving Palestinian flags greeted the body partially wrapped in a traditional headscarf as it arrived by ambulance at a mosque before burial. Mourners carried the body on a stretcher through the thick crowd.

It comes as CCTV footage allegedly 
showing the teen being approached by a group of men as he sat outside a 
shop near his home before being bundled into a car was released by his family.

Outpouring: The boy's body was transferred to an open casket as it was paraded through the streets

Police had earlier beefed up security 
in and around Jerusalem. Extra precautions were taken as the funeral 
coincides with the first Friday prayer services of the Muslim fasting 
month of Ramadan.

Police
 clashed with hundreds of Palestinians in Ras al-Amud and Wadi Joz in 
the eastern sector of the city. The day had been calm before Friday 
prayers, police said, following two days of protests since the boy's 
death.

The burned body of 16-year-old 
Mohammed Abu Khdeir was found on Wednesday in a forest after he was 
seized near his home in east Jerusalem.

News
 of his death prompted outrage in his east Jerusalem neighbourhood of 
Shuafat. Protesters clashed with police for two days, throwing rocks and
 firebombs while security forces responded with tear gas and stun 
grenades.

Abu Khdeir's 
family set up a large tent outside the home for those seeking to pay 
condolences and distributed posters mourning his death.

The
 boy's father, Hussein, said doctors had completed an autopsy, and the 
family was expecting to receive the body after prayers.

Palestinians
 have accused Israeli extremists for the killing, saying it was a 
revenge attack for three Israeli teens that were recently abducted and 
killed in the West Bank.

Israeli police said an investigation was ongoing and the motives remained unclear.

It comes amid media reports of a 
possible truce in the making after Hamas allegedly offered to halt its 
rocket attacks if Israel stops its air raids on the Gaza Strip, a 
cat-and-mouse game that has rumbled on for two weeks.

The official Twitter feed of the Israeli Defense Force issued a warning of a 
possible nuclear leak yesterday - before it claimed it had been hacked by Syrian activists.

The Tweet, which warned of a leak at the country's research reactor near Dimona, Southern Israel, was soon deleted while officials reported a security breach and apologised.

The tweet read: 'Possible nuclear leak in the region after 2 rockets hit Dimona nuclear facility.'

The Syrian Electronic Army (SEA) has apparently claimed responsibility for the hack, tweeting 'Long live Palestine!' via the same account.

On their own account, the SEA said it had hacked 'the whole "Israeli army" propaganda'.

The IDF issued an apology today after deleting the tweets.

'We apologize for the incorrect tweets Our twitter account was compromised,' it said. 'We will combat terror on all fronts including the cyber dimension.'

A source with the Palestinian militant group told the BBC that Egyptian intelligence officials had made 'intensive contacts' with its leaders and 'succeeded in reaching a new truce between 
Hamas and Israel, and that the ceasefire agreement was to be announced 
within hours'.

Israel did not comment on the claims, but the killing has been widely condemned by its leaders.

Israeli
 prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu tried to calm the situation, 
condemning Abu Khdeir's killing and vowing to find the attackers.

'We
 don't know yet the motives or the identities of the perpetrators, but 
we will. We will bring to justice the criminals responsible for this 
despicable crime whoever they may be,' Netanyahu said in a speech 
celebrating US Independence Day at the American Embassy in Tel Aviv. 
'Murder, riots, incitement, vigilantism, they have no place in our 
democracy.'

Meanwhile, CCTV footage allegedly showing Mohammed Abu Khder's kidnap in broad daylight from outside a cafe has emerged.

The
 grainy black-and-white video - filmed from a shop's camera across the 
street - appears to show the 16-year-old sitting outside a shop when a 
light-coloured car drives past.

It
 then reverses up the street and out of frame before two men approach 
the boy. They appear to have a conversation before a struggle ensues, 
the car returns and the boy is bundled inside. It then drives off.

Protests
 broke out in a few areas after Muslim prayers, police said. Hundreds of
 Palestinians threw rocks at police who responded with stun grenades, 
police said.

There were also
 disturbances at the most sensitive holy site in Jerusalem when some 
Palestinians threw rocks there after prayers. There were no immediate 
reports of injuries.

The 
hilltop compound is revered by Jews as the Temple Mount, where the two 
biblical Jewish Temples stood. It is sacred to Muslims as the Haram 
as-Sharif, or Noble Sanctuary, marking the place where they believe the 
Prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven.

On the main road in Shuafat, streets and light rail tracks remained covered in charred debris, rocks and large garbage cans.

Already
 tense Israeli-Palestinian relations increased after three Israeli 
teenagers, one of which had American citizenship, were abducted in the 
West Bank on June 12, sparking a massive manhunt that ended with the 
discovery of their bodies early this week.

Conflict:

the early hours of this morning. The raids are in response to rockets 
fired from the area - one of which struck a house in southern Israel

Many believe he was killed in revenge for the abduction and murder in the occupied West Bank last month of three Israeli teenagers, Naftali Frenkel (left), 16,Â Gilad Shaar (centre), 16, and Eyal Yifrah (right) , 19, whose bodies were found on Monday

Israel
 blamed Hamas for the abductions. Hamas, which has abducted Israelis 
before, praised the kidnapping of the teens but did not take 
responsibility for it.

Israel launched a massive crackdown on the Islamic militant group in the West Bank after the disappearance.

Rocket attacks from the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip on Israel intensified and drew Israeli airstrikes.

The
 military says Palestinian militants have fired some 140 rockets at 
southern Israel in recent weeks. The air force responded with airstrikes
 on about 70 targets in Gaza, the military said.

The
 border area was calmer on Friday morning but attacks from Gaza 
continued. Palestinian militants fired at least 6 rockets and mortars at
 Israel, two of which exploded prematurely inside Gaza, the military 
said.
