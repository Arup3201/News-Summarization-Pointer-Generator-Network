Neil Warnock made an unexpected return to Crystal Palace on Wednesday - and wants to bring Wilfried Zaha with him.

The 65-year-old has been confirmed as Tony Pulis' successor on a two-year deal, pipping Steve Clarke to the post.

And Warnock will launch an immediate swoop to bring Manchester United misfit Zaha back to Selhurst Park on season-long loan.

Boss: Warnock is the new manager of Crystal Palace, beating Steve Clarke to the job

Warnock, who managed Palace for three years from 2007, has just four days to strengthen his squad ahead of the transfer deadline.

However, Palace have been left sweating on their move for Southampton midfielder Jack Cork.

The former Chelsea man has been a long-term target for Palace and the club were close to completing his capture ahead of Warnock's appointment.

But the 25-year-old is set to make a decision on his future over the next 48 hours.

Manager: Neil Warnock previously managed Crystal Palace between 2007-10, but left to join QPR

Palace were down to a shortlist of two, the other contender ex-West Brom boss Clarke.

And following early morning talks, chairman Steve Parish and his fellow co-owners opted for Warnock.

Sportsmail understands Palace are also keen on drafting Notts County manager Shaun Derry into their new-look coaching set-up.

Palace believe Derry, who played for the club, has the traits of a future manager and would benefit from working alongside Warnock.

Warnock's appointment ends Palace's 13 day search for a new boss.

Malky Mackay was within hours of being handed the reins but Sportsmail's extraordinary revelations regarding his controversial texts saw the move collapse.

Tim Sherwood, the other leading contender, then pulled out of the running leaving Warnock and Clarke as the front runners.

Parish has twice toyed with the idea of bringing Warnock back to south London in recent years.

Palace considered handing him the manager's job during their successful promotion winning campaign in 2013 after Ian Holloway side's worrying loss of form towards the end of the season.

He was also a leading contender to replace Holloway after he was sacked last season.
