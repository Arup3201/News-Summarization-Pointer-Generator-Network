$100million man: Neal Mohan, 38, was offered a huge stock option payout not to leave Google for Twitter

Neal Mohan is Google's $100million man.

The company reportedly offered him that astounding sum just so we wouldn't take a job at Silicon Valley rival Twitter.

The deal, reportedly paid in stock options that would fully vest in three years, made the Google vice president higher paid than most American sports star. It's also a figure that exceeds the compensation of most tech CEOs and founders.Â 

It shows that Google is willing to go the distance when it comes to retaining top talent - even mid-level executives, Business Insider has revealed.

By comparison, Google Chairman Eric Schmidt received $101million in 2011 alone.

Mr Mohan, 39, is the man in charge of display ads for Google. He launched and developed the company's approach and execution for that side of Google's business.

It will bring in an estimated $7billion for Google this year, according to Business Insider.

'He is the quiet assassin. He's not a big show-boater,' one client told the news site.

Now, he lives in the upscale San Fransico suburb of Atherton, California.

He
and his wife Heema Sareem Mohan own a $5.2million home. He also rents a
modest apartment near the Google complex in Mountain View.

Mr Mahon is seen with his young son in Shanghai. Google offered him the money to ensure he stayed at least three years

Activist: Mr Mohan's wife, Heema Sareem Mohan, is a regional director for a Democratic state senator in California

His wife, a New York native, is a district director and spokesperson for Democratic State Senator Joe Simitian.

In 2012, he donated $750 to President Barack Obama's reelection campaign.

The news-making pay raise came when 
Twitter began looking in April 2011 for a Chief Production Officer to 
revamp the site's ad sales strategy.

TechCrunch
reported that Google responded by preempting Twitter by offering Mohan 
$100million and Sundar Pichai, another key product employee, $50million 
to keep them from leaving.

Mohan,
an Indian-American who grew up in Florida and Michigan, has an 
electrical engineering degree and an MBA from Stanford University.

Home sweet home: Mr Mohan owns a $5.2million house in the upscale San Francisco suburb of Atherton, California. He also rents a modest apartment outside the Google complex

Neal Mohan's reported $100million offer, spread over three years, makes him one of the highest paid employees at Google.

Only billionaire CEO Eric Schmidt makes more money than Mohan is slated to receive under the deal.

Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, both worth more than $20billion, now receive just $1 a year from the company.

Here is a list of top executives and their 2011 pay:

Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of the board and former CEO - $100.1million

Larry Page, CEO - $1

Patrick Pichette, senior vice president and Chief Financial Officer - $18.3million

Nikesh Arora, senior vice president and Chief Business Officer - $23.1million

David Drummond, senior vice president for corporate development, Chief Legal Officer and Secretary - $18.3million

Sergey Brin, co-founder - $1

Friends and colleagues say Mr Mohan is the best in the business.

He began his career as a glorified technical support worker at a tech company making $60,000 a year.

DoubleClick was a tech pioneer that aimed to sell targeted advertising space to businesses across the world. However, it ran into financial trouble after the dotcom bubble burst.

A private equity firm bought the company for $1.1billion and the CEO hired Mr Mohan to help rehabilitation.

About 18 months later, after Mr Mohan implemented an aggressive plan to streamline and focus the business, Google bought it for $3.1billion.

Since then, he has overseen Google's acquisition of start-up companies to help bolster Google's ad market.

According to Business Insider, Mr Mohan has free rein to develop the display ad business as he needs.

And the company income is growing rapidly as a result. Business Insider estimates that revenue from display ads, which Mr Mohan controls, grew from $5billion to $7billion between 2011 and 2012.
