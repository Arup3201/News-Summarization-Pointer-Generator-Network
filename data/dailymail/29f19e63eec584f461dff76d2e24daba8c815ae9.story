A man dressed as The Joker entered a Florida movie theater on
Wednesday, sending a chill down the spine of moviegoers in the wake of the deadly
Aurora, Colorado shootings.

The 21-year-old, Christoper Sides, showed up at the Premiere
Movie Theater in Melbourne, Florida, with his hair dyed bright
pink and black and white make-up painted on his face - after James Holmes evoked
the Batman villain when he allegedly shot dead 12 people in a Colorado movie theater
on July 20.

Fearing Sides' bizarre appearance, the theater management called police but he was found with no weapons and did not make any
threats.

Joker: Christopher Sides smiled at cameras and seemed amused by the attention as he was arrested

He was arrested though on a warrant for failing to show in
court for a drugs charge.

Sides smiled at cameras and seemed amused by the attention
as he was arrested. He is being held Brevard County Jail and is said to be
cooperating with officers.

According to investigators, he provided no explanation for why
he had done up his hair and face to look like the character played by the late
Heath Ledger in the 2008 film, The Dark Knight.  

Off to jail: The 21-year-old was found with no weapons and did not make any threats. He was arrested on a warrant for a prior charge

He had
purchased a ticket to see The Expendables 2 but later was seen pacing outside the theater,
causing alarm. 

Christopher Sides, 21, gave no explanation for his bizarre appearance

Local news reported that Sides had been involuntarily
committed for mental health issues three times in the last three years.

Former neighbors described Sides as odd but seemingly
harmless, though he did create trouble in the trailer park community where he
lived before he was evicted.

‘I didn't think he was that type [to be violent] but I knew
he was weird,’ a former neighbor Trina Kitchen told WFTV.

‘He dressed like a female. He walked around like a girl,’ she added.

Another resident claimed Sides left behind a kinky assortment of items after he was evicted.

‘I cleaned this unit out and there were sex toys in here and
everything, so he was weird,’ his former neighbor David Springer said.

Another resident described him as having violent tendencies.

‘He was very unstable, swinging samurai
swords. He's had a lot of confrontations with a lot of the neighbors,’ said
former neighbor Joe Astrologo.

But yet another neighbor called Sides misunderstood.

‘He was never a violent person, just an exhibitionist is the best way to put it
liked the attention,’ the neighbor said.
