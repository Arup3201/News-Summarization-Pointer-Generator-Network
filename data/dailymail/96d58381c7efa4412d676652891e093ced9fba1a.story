David Norris and Gary Dobson are expected to be given extra protection in prison amid fears of revenge attacks.

The killers of Stephen Lawrence are thought to be likely targets for reprisals from ethnic minority inmates angered by the vile racist attitudes that emerged during the trial.

It is likely they will serve their sentences in segregated wings alongside other 'vulnerable' prisoners such as paedophiles who are also thought to be at risk of attack.

A legal expert told Mail Online: 
'There is a general duty of care to ensure their safety; how it is 
fulfilled is a matter for the prison governor.

'But Rule 45 is likely to come into play, under which they could be put in solitary confinement for their own protection.

'Precautions could include making them exercise on their own, and housing them in the hospital wing or another solitary wing.

'There is a duty of care to take reasonable steps to keep them safe.'

Rule 45 (formerly Rule 43), is the 
rule that allows the isolation of vulnerable prisoners in the interests of their own personal safety.

The pair are likely to be kept in a segregated to wing to protect against revenge attacks

The
extra precautions - which will come at increased cost to the taxpayer -
follow an attack on Norris in Belmarsh prison, south London, while he 
was on remand awaiting trial.

He was attacked by three black inmates just weeks after he was arrested for Stephen’s murder in September 2010.

Prison
sources said the three men, thought to be Muslims, beat Norris after he
tried to ‘throw his weight around’ by using his family's underworld 
reputation.

The assault left him with problems to 
his hearing and throughout the trial he had to wear a special headset to
follow the proceedings.

It also saw extra protection placed on him at the prison and heightened fears that he and Dobson will be 'marked men'.

The need for extra protection is also 
triggered by the fact that the killers could seek compensation if an 
assault does take place.

Norris could potentially bring legal action against prison authorities for failing in their 'duty of care' towards him.

Following their convictions 
yesterday, the pair were taken to Belmarsh. They are likely to be 
transferred to Category A prisons elsewhere in the country.

Guards are also likely to be told to keep a special watch on the pair to further minimise the danger that they face.

Soham murderer Ian Huntley, who was 
slashed in the throat in 2010 in jail, attempted to sue authorities for 
£100,000 for failing to protect him.

The Ministry of Justice pays significant sums each year to injured prisoners.

A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said inmates at risk were kept apart from other prisoners when necessary.

It is not yet known if the two men convicted of the Lawrence murder will be seen as suicide risks.

But Dobson could yet see his sentence cut short.

Detectives
believe he might seek a deal with prosecutors and finally come clean 
about who else was responsible for Stephen’s death.

Police
believe they have exhausted all opportunities to gather new forensic 
evidence in the Lawrence case, meaning their best chance of nailing the 
other gang members is if a new witness were to come forward, or Dobson – long regarded as one of the ‘weak links’ in the mob –were to become a supergrass.

It is understood the possibility of Dobson co-operating has already been discussed informally by investigators.
