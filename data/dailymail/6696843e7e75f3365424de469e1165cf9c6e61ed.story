Perverted pilot: Michael Pascal was found guilty of groping a young teen girl

An airline pilot found guilty this week of groping a 14-year-old girl while he was a passenger on a flight from Detroit to Salt Lake City last year faces five years behind bars.

Michael Pascal, who has homes in Park City, Utah, and Texas, was found guilty Thursday by a jury after a three-day trial in Salt Lake City, He was convicted of grabbing the teen's buttocks and dashing off to the bathroom.

The girl told investigators that she woke up from a nap on an Oct. 26 Delta Airlines flight and found Pascal's hand under her, gripping her buttocks.

She was sitting next to a window, and Pascal, 45, was in the middle seat.

The perverted pilot, who worked at the time for a regional airline carrier that contracts with Delta, told investigators he fell asleep with his hands in his lap and doesn't know how one ended up underneath the girl.

Pascal's attorney 
said his client was shocked over charges, and that he has a teenage 
daughter of his own. The lawyer insisted any touching that occurred was 
inadvertent.

The startled young girl told authorities she elbowed
 Pascal after waking up with his hand underneath her and asked, 'What the
 hell are you doing?'

She says he pulled his hand out from under her and said, 'I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I was asleep, I have to use the bathroom.'

The armrest that she had pushed down was in the upright position, she recalled.

Pascal said he pulled up the armrest between him and the girl because 
the man on the other side of him was taking up a lot of room, according 
to documents.

Neither police nor the jury bought it. They took only a few hours to find him guilty.

The girl, who was flying alone, told flight attendants what happened and was so shaken she changed seats. She maintained Pascal was 'clearly awake' and put some of his body on her.

He's scheduled to be sentenced July 29 and could face up to five years in prison.
