An undercover newspaper investigation found doctors had apparently agreed to terminate pregnancies based only on the baby's sex, with 'no questions asked'

A decision not to prosecute two doctors who agreed to fix illegal abortions for women based on the gender of their baby has been criticised by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt.

The Crown Prosecution Service said there was enough evidence to bring the cases to court ‘with a realistic prospect of conviction’, but that doing so was not in the public interest.

Mr Hunt criticised the decision last night and asked the Attorney General ‘for urgent clarification’.

Last year an undercover newspaper investigation found doctors had apparently agreed to terminate pregnancies based only on the baby’s sex, with ‘no questions asked’.

Some were recorded admitting they were prepared to falsify paperwork to arrange the abortions and one likened the practice to ‘female infanticide’, it is claimed.

Andrew Lansley, who was health secretary at the time, said he was ‘extremely concerned’ about the allegations and referred the cases to police to investigate whether an offence had been committed.

It is illegal for a pregnancy to be terminated on the basis of the baby’s gender, and the CPS concluded there was sufficient evidence to warrant a prosecution.

But it said that the cases should be dealt with by the General Medical Council – which has no criminal powers – because it ‘would not be in the public interest’ to prosecute the doctors.

It noted that no abortion actually took place.

Mr Hunt voiced alarm about the decision. He said last night: ‘We are clear that gender selection abortion is against the law and completely unacceptable.

‘This is a concerning development and I have written to the Attorney General to ask for urgent clarification on the grounds for this decision.’

As part of the Daily Telegraph investigation last February, reporters accompanied pregnant women to nine clinics across the country, two of which said they were prepared to abort the baby because of its gender.

But after a 19-month inquiry the prosecution service decided that the doctors will not face criminal charges, even though there is enough evidence to prosecute for an attempted breach of the 1967 Abortion Act.

Jenny Hopkins, Deputy Chief Crown Prosecutor for London, said: ‘Taking into account the need for professional judgment which deals firmly with wrongdoing, while not deterring other doctors from carrying out legitimate and medically justified abortions, we have concluded that the cases would be better dealt with by the GMC rather than by prosecution.

‘In coming to this conclusion, we have also taken into account that in these cases no abortion took place or would have taken place.’
