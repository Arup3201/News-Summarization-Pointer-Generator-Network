When Mike Tindall bid £12,000 for a racehorse with an unproven track record at an auction his wife called him 'an idiot'.

But Zara Phillips was forced to eat her words when the horse, bought after a boozy dinner without knowing anything of its history, won the Welsh Grand National in January this year and saw its value rocket to £200,000.

And today, when the horse took to the starting line for the 3.20pm Gold Cup Steeple Chase, Tindall may have allowed himself to believe victory could be his once more.

But sadly, disappointment reigned as Monbeg Dude failed to finish. The 11-4 favourite Bobs Worth was placed first, with Dir De Champs in second and Long Run in third. Monbeg Dude pulled up before the end.

Disappontment: Mike Tindall admitted losing almost bet he placed this week - and would certainly have lost one more when Monbeg Dude failed to finish in the Gold Cup Steeplechase this afternoon. RIGHT: Zara looked stylish in grey at the event today

Also ran: Despite showing early promise when it won the Welsh Grand 
National today, Mike's horse failed to impress at Cheltenham today

Zara, dressed in fur-collared taupe coat and a feather-trimmed hat, joined her husband, smart in a three-piece suit, to watch the race.

The Dude, who at noon today had odds on Betfred of 50-1, is co-owned by Tindall, fellow rugby players James Simpson-Daniel and Nicky Robinson and Michael Scudamore – son of champion jockey Peter. 

Following the surprise win at the Welsh Grand National along with a win at The Henrietta Knight Handicap Steeple Chase in November last year, the Dude's value soared.

Optimistic: Zara Phillips and Mike Tindall at the Gloucestershire race course yesterday

The former England rugby star explained of his spontaneous buy: ‘I like to bid at auctions without meaning to actually win things. I only went for a bite to eat and a night out. No horse had gone for less than £28,000 so I thought my first bid of £10,000 was pretty safe, likewise when I upped it to £12,000.

‘I knew nothing about the horse, hadn't checked the brochure and couldn’t even see the Dude, as I was sitting with my back to the sale ring.'

Fortunately Scudamore, Simpson-Daniel and Robinson agreed to share the burden of the cost - and even with today's loss to contend with, they will no doubt still be pleased that they did, as pundits say we haven't yet seen the best that The Dude has to offer.

Surprise success: Monbeg Dude clearing the last to win The Henrietta Knight Handicap Steeple Chase at Cheltenham race course in November last year

Place your bets: The odds for the Gold Cup Steeple Chase, showing Monbeg Dude at 50-1 as of noon today

ELSEWHERE AT CHELTENHAM...

...Kate keeps an eye on the race and a tight grip on her betting slip - and lets her composure slip for moment

Picked a winner? From Kate's expression it looks like today could have been her lucky day

Thoughts of many at the Festival were 
with leading amateur jockey JT McNamara, who remains in hospital in a 
coma after suffering a serious neck injury when his horse fell.

The Irishman, 37, fell at the first 
fence while riding Galaxy Rock for trainer Jonjo O'Neill in the Fulke 
Walwyn Kim Muir Challenge Cup yesterday afternoon.

JT McNamara could undergo surgery 
today. Medical staff were quickly on hand to treat him after the fall, 
and he was airlifted to Frenchay Hospital in Bristol by air ambulance 
from the Gloucestershire course.

McNamara's uncle, the trainer Andrew McNamara, said: "I've been told that JT is in an induced coma at the moment."

Dr Adrian McGoldrick, chief medical 
officer for the Irish Turf Club, reports there to be no change in 
McNamara's condition but confirmed the rider has damaged two vertebrae.

"There has been no change overnight. He's still in the induced coma," said Dr McGoldrick.

"It is a fracture of the C3 and C4 
vertebrae. He will probably be going for surgery this morning but we 
will know more later in the day."

More than 200,000 people are expected 
to attend the four-day race meeting, which is one of the highlights of 
the national hunt season.

Gate receipts are estimated to reach 
£7 million and bookmakers are anticipating a record-breaking year with 
industry turnover tipped to surpass the £600 million barrier.

Racing fan: Princess Anne attends for the second time this week - and this time will be cheering on her son-in-law's horse
