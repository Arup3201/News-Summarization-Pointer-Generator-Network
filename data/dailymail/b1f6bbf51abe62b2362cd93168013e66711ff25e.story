A new study describes the pitfalls of texting in relationships -- including the fact it can prevent understanding your partner's feelings face-to-face.

Lori Schade and Jonathan Sandberg at Brigham Young University (BYU) followed the texting habits of 276 young adults. 38 percent were in a serious relationship, 46 percent were engaged, and 16 percent were married.

Schade, a therapist, told U.S. News & World Report that her patients tell her how strongly they receive messages. She said they show her texts and 'can feel the emotion.'

Better to give than to receive: the study found sending loving texts was better linked to relationship satisfaction than receiving them

For both men and women, sending 
loving text messages was linked to relationship satisfaction -- even more so than receiving them, a press release from BYU says. Texting may also be useful for couples' 'relationship maintenance.'

However, the authors warn that 'texting is devoid of important face-to-face cues' and can facilitate miscommunication, AllthingsD notes.

'There is a narrowness with texting and you donâ€™t get to see the breadth of a person that you need to see,' Sandberg said in the release.

The release also describes several sources for lovers' digital dissatisfaction -- which may translate to in-person problems.

Women's texts that attempt to solve relationship issues and handle differences, they say, are linked to lower relationship quality.

Men, they noted, may feel less satisfied when they send the majority of messages. Receiving 'frequent' texts was also linked to lower relationship quality.

'We're wondering if this means men disconnect and replace in-person conversations with more texting,' Schade said in the release.

'Maybe as they exit the relationship, they text more frequently because that's a safer form of communication. We don't know why, that is just a conjecture.'

For women, using texts to solver relationship issues is associated with lower relationship quality, researchers say
