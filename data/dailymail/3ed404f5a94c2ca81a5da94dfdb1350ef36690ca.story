More than one in ten of the world's overweight people live in America, a larger amount than any other country, and almost the same as China and India combined

The U.S. is home to more than one in ten of the world's overweight and obese people, a study has shown.

Around 13 per cent of the world's fat population live in America, more than any other country.

The figures is almost the same as China and India combined, which totals 15 per cent of overweight people.

The study also showed that 2billion people - a third of the world's population - are now too heavy.

Data also revealed that every country has seen waistlines expand in the last 30 years.

The highest rates were in the Middle East and North Africa, where nearly 60 percent of men and 65 percent of women are heavy.

'It's pretty grim,' said Christopher Murray of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, who led the study.

He and colleagues reviewed more than 1,700 studies covering 188 countries from 1980 to 2013.

'When we realized that not a single country has had a significant decline in obesity, that tells you how hard a challenge this is.'

Murray said there was a strong link between income and obesity; as people get richer, their waistlines also tend to start bulging.

He said scientists have noticed accompanying spikes in diabetes and that rates of cancers linked to weight, like pancreatic cancer, are also rising.

The new report was paid for by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and published online Thursday in the journal, Lancet.

Last week, the World Health Organization established a high-level commission tasked with ending childhood obesity.

'Our children are getting fatter,' Dr. Margaret Chan, WHO's director-general, said bluntly during a speech at the agency's annual meeting in Geneva.

'Parts of the world are quite literally eating themselves to death.' Earlier this year, WHO said that no more than 5 per cent of your daily calories should come from sugar.

'Modernization has not been good for health,' said Syed Shah, an obesity expert at United Arab Emirates University, who found obesity rates have jumped five times in the last 20 years even in a handful of remote Himalayan villages in Pakistan.

His research was presented this week at a conference in Bulgaria. 'Years ago, people had to walk for hours if they wanted to make a phone call,' he said. 'Now everyone has a cellphone.'

Globally there are around 2billion overweight people, a third of the world's population, with every country seeing waistlines expand over the last 30 years

Shah also said the villagers no longer have to rely on their own farms for food.

'There
 are roads for (companies) to bring in their processed foods and the 
people don't have to slaughter their own animals for meat and oil,' he 
said. 'No one knew about Coke and Pepsi 20 years ago. Now it's 
everywhere.'

The report
 from the US-based Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, 
published in The Lancet, says there has been an increase in obese  
children in developed countries.

But the rise in adult obesity has slowed down.

‘In developed countries, peak prevalence of obesity is moving to younger ages,’ says the report.

‘Evidence
 of a slowdown in the rate of increase of overweight and obesity in the 
developed world provides some hope that the epidemic might have peaked 
in developed countries.’

But
 obesity remains a ‘major global health challenge,’ the report adds, 
with no national success  stories reported over the past  three decades.

The UK and Australia have seen large 
rises in obesity during this period. However, the US tops the global 
league table, containing 13 per cent of the world’s obese people.

John Newton, chief knowledge officer at the government agency Public Health England, said that the ‘worrying’ prevalence of obesity among British girls was partly due to peer pressure to eat fast food.

He told The Times: ‘We have to look at the environment in which people are living, and the constant pressure to eat unhealthy food means things are particularly a problem for girls more than boys.’
