NFL dreams would be out of the question if President Obama had a son.

As part of a profile for The New Yorker, Obama is asked if he might feel ambivalent watching professional football, given recent headlines about concussions and health problems affecting players.

The president's response was clear.

'I would not let my son play pro football,' he said. 'But, I mean, you wrote a lot about boxing, right? We’re sort of in the same realm.'

Though  President Barack Obama poses for photos with members of the 1972 Miami Dolphins including head coach Don Shula (R), quarterback Bob Griese (L) in this August photo, he recently said 'I would not let my son play pro football'

President Barack Obama (L), seen here holding up a jersey given to him by head coach John Harbaugh (R) after welcoming members of the National Football League Super Bowl champion Baltimore Ravens, said NFL players ' know what they're doing' when it comes to the risks of the sport

Obama also said that professional football players are aware of the game's much-publicized risks.

'At this point, there’s a little bit of caveat emptor,' he went on. 'These guys, they know what they’re doing. They know what they’re buying into. It is no longer a secret. It’s sort of the feeling I have about smokers, you know?'

The sentiments expressed in the profile are similar to ones Obama gave to The New Republic in January 2013

'I'm a big football fan, but I have to tell you if I had a son, I'd have to think long and hard before I let him play football,' he said. 'And I think that those of us who love the sport are going to have to wrestle with the fact that it will probably change gradually to try to reduce some of the violence. In some cases, that may make it a little bit less exciting, but it will be a whole lot better for the players, and those of us who are fans maybe won't have to examine our consciences quite as much.'

Seen here with members of the University of Alabama football team in 2013, Obama said last year 'I tend to be more worried about college players than NFL players in the sense that the NFL players have a union, they're grown men, they can make some of these decisions on their own' regarding football's risks

Obama also said at the time he was more concerned about college players as opposed to those in the NFL.

'I tend to be more worried about college players than NFL players in the sense that the NFL players have a union, they're grown men, they can make some of these decisions on their own, and most of them are well-compensated for the violence they do to their bodies,' he said.

'You read some of these stories about college players who undergo some of these same problems with concussions and so forth and then have nothing to fall back on. That's something that I'd like to see the NCAA think about.'

Unlike Obama, San Franscisco 49ers coach Jim Harbaugh last year said his son Jack will be allowed to play the sport when he is old enough, CBS Sports reports.

'I have a 4-month old, almost 5-month old son, Jack Harbaugh, and if President Obama feels that way, then there will be a little bit less competition for Jack Harbaugh when he gets old,' he said.

Last year Obama (here with the University of Alabama team in 2013) said he thought football 'will probably change gradually to try to reduce some of the violence'

Similar to statements given in 2013, when Obama said 'NFL players can make some of these decisions on their own' and most are 'well-compensated for the violence they do to their bodies
