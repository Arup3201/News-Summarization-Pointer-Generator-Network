From the moment her acting career took off as Megan Jones on Saved by the Bell in 1993, Hollywood actress Bianca Lawson has retained a youthful presence on television screens.

For more than 17 years, Lawson has been regularly cast to play a teenage role, despite being twice as old as some of the more recent characters she has played.

The 34-year-old from Los Angeles has appeared in several TV series set in American high schools, from Dawson's Creek and Pretty Little Liars, to the Secret Life of Teenagers.

In all of them she was cast as a 17-year-old, or teenager of a similar age, according to Gawker.

Her first school role was on Saved by the Bell: The New Class, where she played the brainy Megan Jones from September 1993, when she was 14, to December 1994.

After graduating from TV's Bayside High School, Lawson moved on to Sister Sister, another school series, in 1996.

In 1997 she stayed in school, but added the first of several supernatural twists, as she joined the cast of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. She took over the role of being a slayer for three episodes after Buffy, played by Sarah Michelle Gellar, briefly died, according to Buzzfeed.

After leaving the demons of Sunnydale school behind, Lawson attended the set of Smart Guy, where she played another teenager from 1997 to 1999, before leaving to join the cast of Dawson's Creek.

In the popular series, which starred Katie Holmes and James Van Der Beek, Lawson played student film director Nikki Green, from 1999  to 2000.

But, by 2001, Lawson had swapped the Massachusetts setting of Dawson's Creek for Chicago to play Nikki in Save the Last Dance.

Perhaps bored of being typecast as a 17-year-old, Lawson's next role involved her playing a 23-year-old who was dating a high school student in the Secret Life of Teenagers. Her character eventually ditched the boyfriend because he was too young.

However, Lawson soon reverted to playing a younger character, after being cast as the ghost of Emily Bennett on the Vampire Diaries in 2009, and then Maya St Germain in Pretty Little Liars.

She was 31 when she joined the cast of Pretty Little Liars in 2010, but her character remained a teenager until she left the show in 2012.

Finally, at the age of 34, Lawson has managed to act her age, but the school setting remains.

She is currently playing Ms Morell, a French teacher and guidance counselor in MTV's Teen Wolf.
