Families throw away enough food to make six meals a week, claims a damning report into waste.The average household could save up to £400 a year if everything bought was eaten

Families throw away enough food to make six meals a week, claims a damning report into waste.

The average household could save up to £400 a year if everything bought was eaten rather than sent to the tip.

In a stark indictment of the UK’s throwaway culture, MPs reveal in a report today that the nation as a whole dumps food worth £12.5billion a year.

But a booming global population will put food supplies under severe pressure in the near future, experts claim, and there is an urgent need to tackle waste if Britain is to be kept fed.

The report, compiled by the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee, estimates that of the 15million tons of food wasted nationally, nine million tons is completely edible. Anne McIntosh, Tory chairman of the committee, said: ‘Nine million tons of food goes into bins each year, yet a considerable proportion is fit for consumption.

‘This level of waste is unacceptable economically, socially and environmentally.’

With the global population set to hit nine billion by the end of the century, ensuring everyone has affordable, healthy food is a ‘growing challenge’, MPs on the committee warned. They said more people must be encouraged to buy British food, in order to reduce imports from abroad which can often be unreliable.

But food is wasted at every stage of the food chain, the MPs’ report said. Misshapen fruit and veg is left rotting in farmers’ fields, meat quickly passes its sell-by date on supermarket shelves, and ton after ton of uneaten food is taken out of household fridges and put in the bin.

The report said: ‘Half the UK’s food waste (around seven million tons) occurs in the home, with the average household throwing away the equivalent of six meals every week at a cost of £250–£400 a year.’

Farmers and other food manufacturers waste four million tons – 27 per cent of the nation’s waste. And retailers and food distributors throw away 0.4million tons – just under 3 per cent.

Joanna Blythman, a food writer and expert on the British food chain, said a major part of our wasteful habit is caused by the weekly shop.

She told the Daily Mail: ‘For decades, supermarkets have been encouraging us to get all of our food for a whole week in the one store. It means we stock up, but it means we throw more away.

The report said: ‘Half the UK’s food waste (around seven million tons) occurs in the home, with the average household throwing away the equivalent of six meals every week at a cost of £250–£400 a year'

‘People who shop more frequently and regularly are less likely to buy food that they don’t need.’

MPs said despite the amount being thrown away, others are going hungry. The report said: ‘Food donations were used to meet the food needs of an increasing number of people.

‘The Trussell Trust estimated that some 913,000 people had received foodbank support in 2013–14. Oxfam estimates that one in six parents have gone without food themselves in order to feed their family.’

A Government spokesman said: ‘It is wrong that anyone should go hungry at the same time as food is going to waste.

‘We support industry’s action on this, and want to help them build on progress to date. This follows on from publication last year of guiding principles and research to encourage the redistribution of surplus food fit for human consumption.’

Food minister George Eustice told the committee that the Government has tried to reduce waste by changing advice on best-before dates.
