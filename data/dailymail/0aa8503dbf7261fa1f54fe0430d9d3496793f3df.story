While an estimated 400 illegal immigrant children stream across America's southwest border every day in August, President Barack Obama will take a 15-day vacation in a $12 million home nearly as far away as it's possible to travel in the continental United States.

The pricey real estate belongs to a wealthy Connecticut widow whose late husband, then a General Electric executive, made $6,900 in donations to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign in 2007 and 2008 – then the maximum allowed by law.

'On Saturday, August 9th, the president and the first lady will travel to Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts,' a White House official said Wednesday. 'They will remain there until Sunday, August 24th, when they will return to Washington, D.C.'

'There are no public events scheduled at this time.'

Private events, however, will take place in a $12 million, 8,161-square-foot house with seven bedrooms and a whopping nine bathrooms.

The property in Chilmark, Masschusetts sits on 10 acres of forested meadow and features an infinity pool and hot tub, along with a tennis court that doubles as a basketball court.

The weekly Martha's Vineyard Times was first to report on the White House's officially secret choice.

The First Family's has visited the tony Massachusetts island five times since Obama became president.

Last summer they stayed in a 5,000-square-foot, four-bedroom house owned by presidential donor David Schulte.

This year's vacation spot is owned by wealthy widow Joanne Hubschman, whose husband Henry died of cancer in 2011. Four years earlier, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, he made two $2,300 contributions to Hillary Clinton's doomed presidential campaign.

He donated another $2,300 in August 2008, after Obama had sewn up the nomination, to help retire Clinton's campaign debts.

Two months later, just two weeks before the general election, Mr. Hubschman contributed $2,300 to Obama's campaign.

Mrs. Hubschman herself contributed $1,000 to the Democratic National Committee in 1998. She could not be reached for comment.

The late Mr. Hubschman also donated $2,100 to support Democratic Sen. Chris Dodd in 2006, a few years before he pulled out of what would have been his fifth re-election bid.

He made frequent contributions to General Electric's political action committee in 2008, in a year when four of the PAC's five Connecticut donees were Democratic candidates.

Mr. Hubschman was president and CEO of GE Capital Aviation Services, the company's commercial aircraft financing and leasing division, according to his Washington Post obituary.

White House Dossier reported that Obama's August vacation comes after a 16-day stop in Hawaii over Christmas, 'adding up to a total of more than 31 days of vacation in less than a year, not counting weekend getaways.'
