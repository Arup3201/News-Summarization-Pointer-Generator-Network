He split from his long-term girlfriend Cressida Bonas just two months ago.

But now, Prince Harry seems to have bounced back after reportedly kissing a former Miss Edinburgh.

The 29-year-old royal was spotted 'in a clinch' with Camilla Thurlow, 25, at the exclusive Tonteria nightclub in Sloane Square, central London.

The pair apparently had 'a few drinks' and kissed in front of friends at the Mexican bar, club and restaurant, which is owned by Harry's best friend Guy Pelly and frequented by the royals.

A source told The Sun: 'They looked very cosy and kissed more than once. But they are not serious in any way. They're just two young people having a good time.'

They added: 'It's probably unlikely they will see each other again - they are both very busy.'

Miss Thurlow - who shares her first name with Harry's stepmother, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall - works for The Halo Trust, a mine clearance charity with which Diana, Princess of Wales was heavily involved.

The charity, which conducts humanitarian landmine clearance and ordnance disposal operations, was made famous by Diana in 1997 when she visited a minefield in Angola.

The prince himself later become a patron of the charity, but left in March this year.

Miss Thurlow, from Dumfries, studied at the £7,300-a-term Fettes College in Edinburgh, where she gained 9 A*s at GCSE and 3 As at A-level.

She later earned a First Class honours degree in Sport and Exercise Science at Loughborough University, before becoming an assistant manager at fashion chain Abercrombie & Fitch.

Her current work with The Halo Trust involves acting as a project officer in Siem Reap, Cambodia.

Her alleged 'clinch' with Harry was reportedly spotted during a World Cup-themed party, in which bare-chested men waved sparklers and tequila shots were delivered on a train.

It comes just a day after the Prince's ex-girlfriend Cressida was seen sporting a huge smile on her face as she headed home from the Rosemary Branch Theatre following her latest performance.

The 25-year-old dressed down for the occasion in a blue outfit and covered her top half with a bright blue T-shirt, while carrying her possessions in a black handbag.

She also opted for comfort in her choice of shoes - donning a pair of white trainers.

It was Cressida's first play since she split from Harry in April following a two-year relationship.

Friends of the pair confirmed their separation to the Daily Mail, just a month after she attended an official engagement with him for the first time.

At the time, a friend insisted that the break-up was ‘very much an amicable one’ and that they had parted as friends.
