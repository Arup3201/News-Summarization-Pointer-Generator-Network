Many of us embark on quick-fix diets to get beach ready at the 11th hour.

But juice cleanses and trendy diets such as the raw food plan can wreak havoc with your teeth, an expert has warned.

As well as tooth decay, other non-desirable side effects such as bad breath and extra bacteria in the mouth can be the result of extreme dieting efforts, says  Dr Sameer Patel, Clinical Director at London-based dental practice elleven.

Here, he reveals the worst dental offenders when it comes to dieting...

Fad diets such as juicing, low carb and meal replacement plans might be good for the waistline - but may wreak havoc with your teeth, a dental expert has warned

Low calorie diets such as the juice cleanse, popular 
with celebrities including Salma Hayek (left) and Kate Hudson (right) can damage teeth and gums, says Dr Sameer Patel, Clinical Director at dental practice elleven

THE JUICE CLEANSE

 said that low calorie diets like the juice cleanse, which is popular 
with celebrities including Salma Hayek and Kate Hudson, can damage your 
teeth and gums.

The diet, which sees people swap meals for smoothies and juices, causes insulin levels to peak and then plummet which, over time, alters the structure of collagen in the body and affects the gums because collagen fibres hold teeth in place, he explained.

The juice from fruit and vegetables tend to have a high acid content, which severely damages the enamel of your teeth in a similar way to fizzy drinks.

Dr Patel explained that while fruit and vegetables are considered healthy acids, this is only the case when they are consumed as a whole, rather than as a concentrated juice.

‘Fruit’s natural sugar, fructose, is a common cause of cavities as the bacteria in the mouth feed on it, so be careful when you do consume juice as part of a balanced diet.’

He advises drinking juice through a straw and waiting half an hour before brushing your teeth afterwards.

Celebrities including Miranda Kerr (left) and 
Benedict Cumberbatch are said to follow the 5: 2 diet. This is an eating
 plan when people eat a low-carb-high-protein diet (such as a chicken salad, right) and on ‘fast days’ 
their bodies breaks down fat

Trendy diets are leaving millions of Britons with stomach aches and other digestive problems, according to new research.

Just under half of all adults suffer some pain when they try and lose weight and 55 per cent of people aged 25-34 – who are most likely to try ‘faddy’ diets - are in discomfort.

A report by Potter's Cleansing Herbs Tea said that the age group was most likely to try regimes such as Atkins and Cabbage Soup.

In a survey of 2,000 adults, it found that half are on a diet. Those suffering stomach ache are likely to give up their quest to lose weight and pile on the pounds.

Health expert Dr Chris Etheridge said: "It is so important to be aware our digestive health can affect our weight, with so many of us apparently unable to maintain our weight at a healthy level.’

‘Keeping our digestive health in tip-top condition is vital for weight management as well as our overall health.’

THE 5:2 DIET /  LOW-CARB, HIGH-PROTEIN DIET

Celebrities
 including Miranda Kerr and Benedict Cumberbatch are said to follow the 
5: 2 diet.

This is an eating plan when people eat a 
low-carb-high-protein diet and on ‘fast days’ their bodies breaks down 
fat.

‘This
 process results in your body going into a state called ketosis which 
produces the chemicals that cause bad breath,’ Dr Patel said.

‘Ketosis
 is brought on entirely by your diet and unfortunately no amount of 
flossing and brushing will combat the smell so think twice before 
cutting out carbs completely and stick to healthy ones such wholemeal 
pasta and wholemeal bread – these will keep bad breath away whilst 
staying trim.’

MILKSHAKE DIETS

A number of ‘milkshake plans’ encourage people to swap two meals a day for a calorie-controlled milkshake, but the drinks can contain up to 18g of sugar per serving.

The drinks, consumed by celebrities including Shane Warne, can cause tooth decay and promote plaque build-up which leads to cavities which cannot be washed or brushed away, Dr Patel warned.

He advises dieters to read the label of such shakes carefully to choose the least sugary options as well as rinsing their mouths with water or chewing gum afterwards to reduce the effect on the milkshakes might have on their teeth.

'HEALTHY MEAL REPLACEMENTS'

‘Diet
 plans that offer people ready-made calorie controlled meal 
replacements, tend to take out the fat and replace it with extra sugar 
and salt to keep the flavour. This can be extremely damaging to your 
teeth,’ Dr Patel said.

Some
 replacement snacks are higher in sugar than regular snacks and people 
who snack are at higher risk of tooth decay because eating between meals
 increases the contact between sugar and teeth throughout the day.

As
 well as cooking low calorie meals at home, where the salt and sugar 
content can be monitored, the dentist recommends that people switch 
coffee for green tea, which reduces teeth staining and helps to fight 
bacterial infection and inflammation.

RAW FOOD DIET

While
 sticking to raw foods such as fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds, like 
celebrities such as Demi Moore and Scarlett Johansson, sounds like a 
healthy plan, they can damage your teeth.

‘Despite
 the sugars in fruit being natural, when they make their way into your 
mouth, there is no difference between the sugars from fruit and the 
sugars from chocolate or sweets,’ he said.

‘All
 this sugar is constantly eroding your teeth and acts like a time bomb. 
Small problems mount up on each tooth, leading to cavities and larger 
dental issues which can be painful and very expensive to resolve.’

Dr
 Patel also warned that nuts and seeds are easily lodged between teeth 
so it is easier for bacteria to attach to teeth and multiply. He advises
 that people floss or chew gum after a snack of nuts.
