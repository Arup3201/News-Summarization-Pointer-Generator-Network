After having three children, a mother from Plymouth hoped to get her confidence and svelte figure back by having a tummy tuck.

But the operation went disastrously wrong, leaving Gemma, 30, looking like she had 'been bitten by shark.'

The mother-of-three shares her story in the latest episode of Last Chance Salon, where she hopes cosmetic surgeon Mr Vik Vijh can repair her misshapen stomach.

'I feel like a freak': Gemma's stomach was left swollen, scarred and lumpy after her botched tummy tuck

Gemma explains how she saved up £3,200 with her husband Chris' support to have a tummy tuck in the hope she could have a flat stomach again after having three children.

'My husband was working out of the 
country at the time and my plan was my body would be all fixed and how I
 wanted it by the time he came back,' she said.

Gemma went to Poland to have the operation but her nightmare began when she woke up during the surgery.

'Everything is wrong': Surgeon Mr Vik Vijh at the Last Chance Salon said it was one of the worst cases of surgery gone wrong he had ever seen

Op regrets: The mother-of-three said she looked like she'd been bitten by a shark thanks to the scarring, misaligned belly button and lumpy skin folds she was left with

'I woke up during anesthetic and couldn't move 
which was horrible, I was trying to open eyes,' she recalled. 'They must have noticed I 
wasn't completely under as I was gagging on the tube in my throat.'

But Gemma's ordeal did not end there. After flying back to her home in Devon two days after the operation, she developed gangrene and then had to be hooked up to a machine to 'suck all the infection out.'

She was left with a scared and misshapen body she was ashamed of.

She said: 'It looks like I've been bitten by a 
shark. The scar is all crinkly, my belly button is too high and off to 
the side. One area looks swollen, it's just a big mess. It looks 
horrible.'

Fix: Gemma has a flatter stomach, realigned belly button and less skin folds after reconstructive surgery, right

She added: 'It does affect my relationship with my husband because I don't want to be naked with him because I feel a bit like a freak.'

After visiting  Mr Vijh at The Last Chance Salon, he commented that her botched tummy tuck was 'one of worst cases I've seen'. 'Everything is wrong,' he added.

But the surgeon, who specialises in cosmetic and reconstructive surgery, was confident Gemma's problem could be solved - if she could dare to go under the knife again after her previous experience. 

Gemma plucked by the courage to have the reconstructive surgery at Nuffield Health Hospital in Hereford and was delighted with the results.

Confidence restored: The mother said she's delighted with the results of the second operation

They fixed her underlying abdominal muscles, lumpy lipo and realigned her belly button. She was left with some scarring but Mr Viji said this should fade in six months.

'It's amazing, I can't believe it,' Gemma said of her new body. 'My belly button is in the right place and the swelling gone.'

She added that the surgery has given her a new lease of life and her confidence back.

'We've booked a holiday in August and I can't wait to get my bikini on which I would never have done before,' she said.
