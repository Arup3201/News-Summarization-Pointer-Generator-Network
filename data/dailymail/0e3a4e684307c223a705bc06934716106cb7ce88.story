The mystery of how a U.S. World War 2 fighter pilot met his grisly end after crashing in a South Pacific island jungle has been revealed - after 31 years of painstaking work.

Lt Moszek Murray Zanger was initially believed to have been shot and killed immediately after being captured by the Japanese following his 4,000ft parachuting out of his Corsair.

He had collided midair with his wingman while out on patrol over Rabaul, Papua New Guinea.

Helping hand: Villagers from Vudal who helped uncover the plane flown by Zanger, whose nieces stood behind the USMC flag (left to right) are Andrea Talbutt, Marcy Hanigan and Susan Nishihira. Henry Sakaida is pictured at the rear.

But a dogged forensic investigation has discovered he was in fact beaten, tried to flee in an inflatable dinghy and was captured by a Japanese Navy patrol boat.

He was then kept chained inside a hut for six months, before being killed and buried near an airstrip.

Retired Temple City nursery owner Henry Sakaida, researching the air combat incident, became fascinated with the case and persevered for 31 years to find 'the truth'.

And the 60-year-old's discoveries enabled him to take Zanger's three nieces - Marcy Hanigan, Andrea Talbutt and Susan Nishihira - to the site of their downed uncle's aircraft.

It was back in 1981 when Sakaida, who studies World War 2 air combat incidents to then track down dogfighters to try and reunite them, first learned from Australian military records that Japanese Prisoners of War had seen an American pilot in captivity in March 1945.

They said his name was 'Zanga', and records detailed he was killed shortly after being captured - and following his attempt to escape by grabbing a sword and trying to attack two guards.

But Sakaida discovered that forensic investigations revealed Zanger's remains, when recovered by the U.S., showed he had been beaten, not shot.

The intrepid historian then found that the pilot was later buried somewhere in Los Angeles. After further research, he was told Zanger's grave was in the Home of Peace Cemetery.

But his mother and father had died, and Sakaida could not find any trace of any other relatives.

It was when their mother died in 2009 that the sisters decided to try and piece together what had happened to their uncle.

Googling his name, they were 'flabbergasted' to see Sakaida's research on him. They contacted him and they made plans to visit Rabaul.

Sakaida told the Los Angeles Times: 'Instead of me tracking them down, they tracked me down.

'I turned over a thick folder I'd collected about him and told them that we all should someday go to Rabaul.'

The trip was put together and, through help from Pacificwrecks' Justin Taylan, they found the co-ordinates of the crash site and then discovered the wreck.
