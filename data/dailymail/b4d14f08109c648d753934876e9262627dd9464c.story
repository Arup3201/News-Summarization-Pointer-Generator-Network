Winning an Academy Award is the pinnacle of success for those in the film industry and so it's perhaps no surprise that many have been overcome with emotion in their moment of triumph.

While most over the decades have been able to accept their Oscars with dignity, grace and a stiff upper lip, others have not been able to hold back the tears.

Gwyneth Paltrow is arguably the most famous Oscar cry baby as she sobbed through her acceptance speech when she won Best Actress for Shakespeare In Love in 1999.

She was already struggling to hold back the tears as stepped on to the stage to collect her trophy from Jack Nicholson but managed to hold it together as she thanked the cast and crew she'd worked with.

But when she started to thank her family, she couldn't stop crying with her voice becoming squeaky and at times inaudible. 

It was thanking her family that reduced Angelina Jolie to tears too when she accepted her Oscar for best supporting actress in Girl Interrupted in 2000. 

Her voice broke as she sang the praises of her brother, James, mother Marcheline Bertrand, who died in 2007, and her father, actor Jon Voight - with whom she has since had a turbulent relationship.

Halle Berry gave Gwyneth a run for her money as the biggest blubber when she received her best actress award in 2002 for Monster's Ball - making her the first black woman to be given the honour. 

'Oh my god,' she sobbed with tears streaming down her face, 'this moment is so much bigger than me.' 

Jennifer Hudson could barely start her speech in 2007 when she won the best supporting actress award for Dreamgirls as she was so overcome with emotion.

'Oh my god, I just have to take this moment in, I just cannot believe this, look what god can do, if my grandmother was here to see me now...' she gushed.

Natalie Portman can be forgiven for her tears as she won best actress in Black Swan in 2011 as she was pregnant at the time and at the mercy of her hormones.

Octavia Spencer was given a standing ovation as she accepted her gong in 2012 for The Help and the reaction meant she struggled to speak though most of her speech. 

'I'm sorry, I'm freaking out!' she wept. 

Anne Hathaway maintained her composure when she made her acceptance speech in 2013 when she won for her role in Les Miserables but it all caught up with her backstage when she burst into tears at the photocall clutching her gold statue.

Nicole Kidman, Charlize Theron and Hilary Swank are other notable A-listers who wept as they won their Oscars.

Actress Meryl Streep should be used to the emotional rollorcoaster of the Oscars with 19 nominations and three victories under her belt, but here she sheds a tear as she hugs Peter O'Toole on stage in 2003

But it's not just the women who have struggled to hold back the tears.

Ben Affleck struggled to contain his emotions as Argo - which he directed, produced and starred in -won the Best Picture Oscar in 2013.

He became emotional as he thanked his wife - actress Jennifer Garner - for working hard to make their marriage last and his voice broke as he dedicated the award to their children Violet, Samuel and Seraphina.

So as the 87th Academy Awards takes place this Sunday evening, let's hope the nominees have all packed their hankies and practiced their speeches.
