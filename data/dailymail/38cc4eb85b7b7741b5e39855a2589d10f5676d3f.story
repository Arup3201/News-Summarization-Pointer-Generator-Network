She normally shies away from even having the merest sip of wine in public.

But there was something about being north of the border yesterday that put the Duchess of Cambridge – using her Scottish title the Countess of Strathearn – in the mood for a wee dram. Or four.

Kate and her husband, also given the title Earl of Strathearn by the Queen on his marriage, were on a visit to the country’s oldest distillery, Glenturret, home to The Famous Grouse Experience, when they decided to enter into the, er, spirit of things with a little whisky tasting.

Challenged with a glass of 68.9 per 
cent proof alcohol, straight from the still, William threw caution to 
the wind and declared: ‘I’ll give anything a go [but] I will probably 
regret it later!’

Shaking his head he squeaked: ‘That’s 
pretty busy!’ and offered the glass to his wife. Kate wisely declined, 
but had another sip of her glass of The Naked Grouse. ‘I’ll stick with 
that girlie one,’ she laughed, but also tried two of the other blends.

It was the couple’s first public 
engagement together since their successful tour of New Zealand and 
Australia. Kate was wearing a long red coat by Jonathan Saunders – no 
risk of a bottom-bearing incident – a dress by Goat and a Celtic brooch 
given to her as a wedding present.

After the tasting at Crieff-based 
Glenturret, the couple enjoyed a civic reception and lunch, but there 
was still more drinking to do.

At their last engagement of the day, the Forteviot Fete, Kate was asked to try a sip of gin from the Strathearn Distillery.

She gamely downed it, saying: ‘It’s 
delicious,’ but added: ‘I had better not drink too much because of all 
the whisky I drank at Glenturret.’

The pair were then shown around the bunting-festooned stalls at the
 village fete by John Dewar, Lord Forteviot, who is the scion of the 
Dewar whiskey dynasty, and Luisa Ramazzotti, the founder of Perthshire 
Open Studios and an artist in her own right.

Ever
 the horseman, the Duke of Cambridge stopped off to inspect
 the steeds ridden by members of the local pony club, although one 
cheeky palomino couldn't resist giving his fingers a quick lick.

Also
 at the fete was the glamorous Lady Georgina Bullough, the daughter of 
the Earl of Mansfield and who was once dubbed 'the most beautiful girl 
in Britain' by society magazine, Tatler.

But this time around, all eyes were on the Duchess who looked chic in a crimson coat by Jonathan Saunders, which she teamed with a matching dress by Goat.

A-list
 favourite Goat, which counts Gwyneth Paltrow, Sienna Miller and 
Victoria Beckham among fans, has made a name for itself as a go-to label
 for understated luxury with a sophisticated aesthetic - all of which 
made it perfect for the Duchess, who is still reeling after a German 
tabloid printed a photograph of her bottom earlier this week.

Clearly 
intent on putting the controversy behind her, the Duchess played it safe
 with the rest of her ensemble which included a pair of her favourite 
L.K Bennett 'Sledge' court shoes and a delicate silver brooch in the 
shape of a Celtic knot.

Earlier,
 the Duchess,  with husband Prince William by her side, had beamed as 
she accepted a dram after being shown how Scotch is made during a tour 
of the Famous Grouse Distillery in Glenturret.

Giggling
 madly, the royal couple were asked to pour themselves a shot of whisky 
from one of the huge barrels before going on to a reception where they 
met local worthies.

Cheers!

The Famous Grouse distillery is the 
oldest in Scotland, and was founded in 1775 - a year before the US 
gained independence from the UK. Along with producing world-class 
whisky, it is also a popular tourist attraction, hosting more than 
100,000 guests a year.

The Duke 
and Duchess, who are known as the Earl and Countess Strathearn north of 
the border, were making their first public appearance as a couple since 
returning from the hugely successful tour of Australia and New Zealand.

Their
 day began with a visit to the Strathearn Community Campus in Crieff, 
where they met local children and were given a tour of a Scottish 
Ambulance Service helicopter - much to the delight of pilot William.

The
 royal couple were then whisked off to unveil a plaque at MacRosty Park 
where they were greeted by huge cheering crowds, before being taken off 
to visit the Famous Grouse distillery and finally, Fonteviot village fete.
