The 21-year-old grandson of wealthy oil and gas titan T. Boone Pickens died Tuesday from a suspected drug overdose.

Thomas Boone Pickens IV was taken to a hospital in Fort Worth, Texas from an off-campus apartment in a private vehicle around 9:30 a.m. A student who found Pickens said that the victim wouldn't wake up and that he had probably been dead for several hours.

Sources told NBC5 that an overdose was thought to be the cause of death after witnesses told police that Pickens injected heroin and took the prescription pill Xanax on Monday.

Happy go lucky: Pickens liked to be called Ty and was studying strategic communications at Texas Christian University

Pickens was a junior at Texas Christian University where he was majoring in strategic communications.

An unnamed young man answered the door at the condo where Pickens was taken to the hospital from and confirmed that he and his cousin - both TCU students - were with Pickens Monday night.

The student said they had left Pickens alone to go to the store on Monday and when they returned, he appeared to be sleeping. When Pickens didn't wake up on Tuesday morning, the roommate's cousin drove him to the hospital.

An autopsy was performed today but authorities said an official cause of death may take between two and four weeks to determine.

Police searched the condo for drugs later on Tuesday morning, they have yet to decide if they will arrest anyone who may have been involved in the drug use.

'Ty’s loss at such a young age is an unspeakable family tragedy for the entire Pickens family and his many friends,' the family said in a statement.

'We mourn his passing and respectfully request that the family be allowed to grieve in private in this time of sorrow.'

His grandfather is worth more than $1.2 billion and spent a lifetime in the oil industry.

Ty's father, Thomas Boon Pickens III, is the industrialist's youngest son.

TCU released a statement saying, 'We are deeply saddened by the loss of 
this member of our community and our hearts and thoughts are with Ty's 
family at this time,' Dr. Cavins Tull, TCU vice chancellor for student 
affairs, said, according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.

A police spokeswoman confirmed 'there is no evidence of foul play, so we are not investigating this as a homicide or suicide or anything at this point.'

'We are just awaiting the results of the autopsy, and then we will proceed from there,' said Fort Worth police spokeswoman Sharron Neal, according to the Dallas Morning News.

Ty's friends took to Facebook to express their grief over his untimely passing.

'Love and miss you Cheese! Never will forget you,' wrote one pal.

'One hell of an angel if you ask me,' the friend also wrote beneath a picture of Ty.

Scene: Pickens was found unconscious at this off-campus in Fort Worth, Texas

T. Boone Pickens, 84, got his career started in 1956 when he founded Mesa Petroleum.

He later gained a reputation in the 1980s as a corporate raider with planned takeovers of numerous other companies.

Pickens has also been actively involved in national politics.

He
 was one of the leading opponents against Democrat Sen. John Kerry's bid
 to unseat President George W. Bush from the White House in 2004.

And now, after a career in the oil industry, he has championed a plan to 
get America to use fewer fossil fuels by promoting alternative energy 
such as wind, solar and natural gas.

He plans to build the world's largest wind farm in Texas to champion his idea.

Pickens has also donated at least $265 million to his alma mater, Oklahoma State University.

He recently separated from his fourth wife, Madeleine, after seven years of marriage.

exclusive suburb of Preston Hollow, Dallas where neighbors include 
former president George W. Bush, many of the Dallas Cowboys and George 
Michael. Homes can cost as much as $40million.

The
 wealthy industrialist also owns the Mesa Vista, a property worth around
 $35million set in 68,000 acres in Roberts County, Texas.

The billionaire has his own 
gulfstream jet which he parks at his private airport in Pampa, Texas and
 fuels up to take him to Oklahoma State football games. 

Pickens started his career at Phillips Petroleum before founding Mesa Petroleum in 1956.
