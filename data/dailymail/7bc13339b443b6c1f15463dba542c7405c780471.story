Angel of Woolwich: Gemini Donnelly who rushed to the scene along with her mother as Lee Rigby lay dying

A brave mother dubbed the Angel of Woolwich because she risked her own life by comforting Drummer Lee Rigby as he lay dying said she did it because of a 'mother's instinct'.

Amanda Donnelly, 44, and her daughter Gemini, 20, comforted the young soldier after he was targeted near Woolwich Barracks.

The pair protected the 25-year-old father-of-one from further attacks and gently stroked his body.

The mother and daughter, who were driving past on their way to Tesco when they stumbled across the bloodbath, said they acted instinctively.

Their brave actions won praise from Downing Street, but despite calls for the mother and daughter to be given medals Amanda said they don't deserve them.

The mother-of-three said she stopped her car as she drove past the scene where Lee Rigby had been attacked and instinctively rushed to be at his side.

'I sat on the floor next to Lee's chest. I wasn't really aware of the danger, his body was still warm,' she told the Sunday People.

'I started thinking about his mum. I 
thought "This poor boy, his mother doesn't need to see this". So I just 
stayed there to protect him and rubbed his back. It was a mother's 
instinct really.'

As Amanda got out of the car, Gemini, who is currently looking for work, also rushed over despite fearing she could be attacked.

The
pair realised instantly that Rigby, who has a two-year-old son, could 
not be saved. They said the kerb was covered in blood following the 
attack.

Drummer Rigby was walking back to his barracks in a Help For Heroes top when he was suddenly targeted.

The young soldier from the Second Battalion the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers had served in Afghanistan as a machine gunner.

Amanda
added: 'I knew there was nothing I could do for the poor guy - but 
kneeling over him and stroking him seemed like the right thing to do at 
the time. I wish there was more I could have done.'

Another woman, Ingrid Loyau-Kennett, 48, also won praise for bravely stepping forward while other passers by simply watched on.

Amanda said it was only afterwards that they realised the enormity of the situation when they saw news reports on television.

It took her several hours to notice that she was covered in blood.

Amanda and Gemini were later interviewed by police about what they saw for seven hours and were ordered to hand over the clothing they were wearing at the time because it had the dead soldier's blood on it.

Michael Adebolajo, 28, of Romford, and Michael Adebowale, 22, of Greenwich, have both been charged with murder following the killing on May 22.

They have been remanded in custody.

Honour: There have been calls for the Angels of Woolwich to be given the George Cross

Thousands of people have demanded that Angels of Woolwich Amanda Donnelly and her daughter Gemini should be given medals - but they insist they don't deserve them.

More than 82,000 people have signed a petition calling for the pair to be given the George Cross for their bravery.

The pair rushed to be at Drummer Lee Rigby's side as he lay dying in Woolwich last month.

Their actions won widespread praise - but Amanda modestly said medals are for 'real heroes like Lee Rigby' and not for them.

The father-of-one has a two-year-old son, called Jack, and she said she would give any medal she received to him.

She told the Sunday People: 'He is going to grow up without a dad now, which is so sad, so it may give him something to hold on to.

'But we don't really want medals. We don't feel we deserve them.'
