Jailed: Foulser was sentenced to eight months in prison yesterday

A newly qualified driver mowed down a great-grandmother on a pedestrian crossing while revving her car in frustration at a couple dawdling across the road.

After killing 75-year-old Averil Monks, who was crossing just behind the couple, Natalie Foulser, 21, broke down and screamed: ‘I want my dad.’

A court heard that Mrs Monks’s husband George, 76, died 14 months later a broken man after being left inconsolable and refusing to sleep in their bedroom.

Foulser was in the outside lane of a dual carriageway in June last year when she saw Coral Bawden and Anthony Ainsworth on a pedestrian crossing up ahead.

Believing they were walking ‘deliberately slowly’, she engaged the clutch and revved the engine of her Honda Civic to scare them off the road while her car was still moving at around the 30mph speed limit.

She then drove over the crossing at around 35mph while staring angrily at the couple, who had to jump out of the way.

But Foulser did not see Mrs Monks, who was hidden from view by the couple, and smashed into her. The retired hospital nursing sister, was fatally injured and died at the crossing in Marton, near Blackpool, Lancashire.

Afterwards, Foulser cried for her father and wailed: ‘I can’t believe I’ve just killed someone.’

Paul Cummings, prosecuting, said that because she was staring at the pedestrians, she only saw Mrs Monks at the very last moment and was unable to avoid hitting her.

Foulser was jailed for eight months after a judge at Burnley Crown Court said her attention should have been on the road instead of rebuking pedestrians.

Mr Ainsworth said: ‘When we got to the central reservation we could see cars in the distance but they were far enough away for us to make the call to cross.

‘As we got close to the pavement I heard a loud noise – like a car was revving its engine, so I grabbed Coral and we ran to the pavement. The car’s exhaust made two really loud noises, increasing in volume. 

‘What I saw next made me feel physically sick.’ Miss Bawden said: ‘Just after the crash I did see the driver get out of the car in a distressed state and I heard her say, “I can’t believe I’ve just killed someone”.’

Foulser told police: ‘They continued to stare at me and I stared back. They were a hazard in my way and when I stared back, there was another hazard in the way.’

Witnesses described the accident and its aftermath to the court.

Gail Miller said: ‘I went to her and tried to assist her and calm her down. She said, “Two kids were messing about around the junction. I revved my engine to scare them because they were messing about”.’

David Marsden, a driving instructor, said: ‘The female driver was in hysterics on the central reservation and was screaming, “I want my dad”. She then said either “It revved” or “I revved it”.’

Wayne Jackson, defending, said: ‘This is a momentary lapse of judgment by somebody who is new to driving. The two pedestrians had hidden Mrs Monks from view beyond the crossing.

'She has been significantly traumatised by what took place. She has apologised every day in her head. She was a talented artist, described in testimonials as gifted, but humble.’

Judge Robert Altham told her: ‘Inexperience must have played some part in this accident. There was at least an element of you rebuking these people by continuing to stare at them and that meant you didn’t see Mrs Monks until it was far too late.

‘It is clear you are a bright young woman, cherished by your family.

‘But Averil Monks was also somebody cherished by her family.

‘Her husband, in particular, was devastated. He couldn’t go home for many months and when he did, he couldn’t bring himself to sleep upstairs.

'He changed from being a happy, confident man into being an absolutely inconsolable, unhappy man in the last months of his life.’

Foulser, of Fleetwood, admitted causing death by careless driving.

She sobbed as she was jailed, banned from driving for two years and ordered to take an extended driving test.
