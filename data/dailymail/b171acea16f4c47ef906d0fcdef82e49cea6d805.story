An outbreak of a rare form of meningitis has left two people dead and a dozen fighting for their lives  in Tennessee - after they all received steroid injections for back pain.

All but one of the victims - in their late 40s to their early 80s -  are known to have visited the same health clinic in Nashville to get the lumbar epidural jabs.

But more than 700 patients who had similar procedures at Saint Thomas Outpatient Neurosurgery Center, in Nashville, could be at risk on top of up to 200 at another clinic where the same batch of drugs was administered, government experts warned.

There are also fears that the deadly 
brain bug may be spreading into other states after a 14th fell ill in 
North Carolina having undergone similar treatment.

Now government health chiefs are probing an 
unidentified drug-manufacturing firm as they desperately try to recall 
hundreds of samples from hospitals across the state amid fears more may be 
infected.

'This is a serious 
disease,' said Marion Kainer, an infectious disease expert with the 
state health department. 'There is not a lot of experience in treating 
this, but we are getting the best experts together.'

The outbreak is a rare type caused by a fungus and is not spread from person to person.

Doctors think the infections were caused by contamination of the steroid with the fungus, known as aspergillus.

Saint Thomas Outpatient Neurosurgery Center has voluntarily shut down in a bid to contain the outbreak.

Fears: Dr. David Reagan, chief medical officer for the Tennessee Department of Health, said two more confirmed cases in the past 24 hours brought the total to 14

The clinic contacted 737 
patients who had lumbar epidural steroid injections between July 30 and 
September 20, officials said.

But between 100 and 200 patients at Specialty Surgery Center in Crossville, 
Tennessee, may have been exposed or at risk because of injections at the same time.

Dr. David Reagan, chief medical 
officer for the Tennessee Department of Health, said two more confirmed 
cases in the past 24 hours brought the total to 14.

Fungal meningitis is rare but can be deadly.

Although anyone can get fungal meningitis, people at higher risk include those who have AIDS, leukemia, or other forms of immunodeficiency.

It is not contagious between people but can be caught by inhaling fungal spores from the environment, often found in bat or bird droppings.

In the case in Tennessee, it is believed steroid injections may have been contaminated by the aspergillus fungus.

The infection causes inflammation of the membranes surrounding the spinal cord and brain.

Symptoms include a severe headache, vomiting, a rash, sensitivity to light and a stiff neck.

If untreated, it can result in death.

While 13 of those who contracted the infection had received steroid injections for back pain at the Nashville clinic, the other case was reported in North Carolina in a patient who had received the same type of injection.

Marion
 Kainer, an infectious diseases physician and epidemiologist with the 
Tennessee Health Department, said it's still too early to pinpoint the 
source.

But Kainer 
said three lots of injectable steroid used at a Nashville clinic between
 July 30 and Sept. 20 have been recalled by the manufacturer.

The clinic, the Saint Thomas Outpatient Neurosurgery Center, voluntarily shut its doors Sept. 20.

Officials haven't identified the drug manufacturer or the city in North Carolina where one of the cases was reported. Reagan said that publicizing too much information at this time could negatively affect the investigation.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesman Curtis Allen said the agency is working with health departments in other states to determine whether other patients might be affected.

He could not say how many people or clinics could potentially be affected nationally.

In Tennessee there are about 900 people who received the injections at two clinics during the timeframe under investigation.

No one from the second clinic has at this time been found to have contracted the disease, officials said.

Allen cautioned that while the injectable steroids were one thing the sickened patients had in common, there could also be other things in common, such as the anesthetic or the antiseptic, and the search for a cause is ongoing.

Of the 11 surviving patients in Tennessee, some are in critical condition while others are improving, Reagan said.

Health Department spokesman Woody McMillin said so far it has taken patients between seven days and 28 days to develop symptoms. Officials say new cases could yet be identified in coming days.
