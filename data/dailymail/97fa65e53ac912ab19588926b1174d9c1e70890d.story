Gerald Yilmaz was sent home twice from A&E after doctors before he died of complications caused by a brain abscess

A man with a deadly brain abscess died after he was sent home twice by A&E doctors who mistook his symptoms for his learning disability, an inquest heard.

Staff at Whittington Hospital in Archway, north London, failed to diagnose Gerald Yilmaz’s  condition.

They wrongly attributed his confusion and a drooping eyelid to his learning disability, the hearing was told.

Mr Yilmaz, 37, of Finsbury Park, visited A&E three times in as many days last July.

But he was twice discharged by doctors who thought he only had an ear infection and a migraine, St Pancras coroner’s court heard.

Mr Yilmaz’s sister, Sevim Yilmaz, 35, said after the inquest: ‘We knew that something was not right.

‘His eye was drooping, but they thought he was just like that.

‘It’s devastating, we just think what would have happened if they diagnosed him earlier?’

The inquest has highlighted that symptoms can be wrongly overlooked in patients with learning difficulties because it is assumed they are part of their disability.

Mr Yilmaz’s family is determined his death will have an impact on hospital procedures by forcing improvements at the Whittington and raising awareness of the problem.

His younger brother, Muhammed Yilmaz, 22, said: ‘We hope that this will be the spark for change and we expect to see big changes from The Whittington.

‘This is not about individual blame, it’s about a system that’s broken.’

Beverley Dawkins, policy manager at learning disability charity Mencap, accompanied the family to the inquest.

She said: ‘This is the biggest thing 
that kills people with learning disabilities. The delay in diagnosis is 
something that too many people experience.’

Mr Yilmaz, who worked as a gardener at The Harington Scheme in Cholmeley Park, Highgate, was diagnosed with an ear infection on July 2 and prescribed antibiotics by a GP.

He
was taken to A&E on July 15 after his condition suddenly worsened 
but was released with another prescription of antibiotics.

Mr Yilmaz, who had the IQ of a seven or eight-year-old, returned to hospital still ill the next day, the inquest heard.

But Dr Edwina Lawson sent him home again after diagnosing an ear infection, this time combined with a migraine.

Dr Lawson told the inquest that ‘diagnostic overshadowing’, whereby she attributed his symptoms to his learning disability, was a factor in her blunder.

A report by the hospital also cited this as one of the main reasons that serious signs of Mr Yilmaz’s critical illness were not acted on.

Whittington Hospital has pledged to host training sessions, improve and overhaul procedures and appoint a learning disabilities champion in the emergency department

Acting coroner Dr Shirley Radcliffe said the symptoms, including drowsiness, confusion and a drooping eyelid, should have rang alarm bells.

She said Dr Lawson should have got a second opinion at the very least.

Mr Yilmaz was finally sent for surgery at Queen’s Hospital, Romford, Essex, after returning to Whittington Hospital on July 17.

But he died on July 23 of complications caused by the abscess after having three operations in a last-ditch bid to save his life.

Recording a narrative verdict, Dr Radcliffe said: ‘It’s more likely than not that earlier detection and treatment to the cerebral infection [which caused the abscess] would have prevented a fatal outcome.’

A spokesman for Whittington Hospital said: 'We deeply regret the delay that occurred in making the correct diagnosis for this patient, and have offered our profound apologies and condolences to his family.

'The patient had a learning disability and our investigation highlighted the need for us to take additional steps to reduce the chance of patients with learning disabilities receiving a delayed diagnosis.  'We have since made substantial changes to strengthen the care we give to people with learning disabilities, and to minimise the chance of a similar delay in diagnosis happening again.

'These include ensuring that a specially trained nurse is called to act as an advocate when a patient with a learning disability comes to the hospital.

'We are also training all staff in the Emergency Department in the best care for patients with learning disabilities.'
