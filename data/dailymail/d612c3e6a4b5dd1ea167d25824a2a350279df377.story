Leeds owner Massimo Cellino says an offer has been made to re-purchase Elland Road.

Leeds sold the stadium in 2004 for £8million. The ground is owned by the businessman Jacob Adler but the club have the option to buy back Elland Road for a set fee by 2029, when their 25-year lease ends.

Cellino intends to use some of the money from Ross McCormack's £11m sale to Fulham. He said: 'The money from McCormack cannot be wasted. We sent a letter yesterday (Saturday).'

'My accountant sent a letter because we want our stadium back. I hope it will be done soon. Before November 100 per cent, because in November the rent will be raised.

'We have to pay. I have to buy the stadium, then I have to fix a lot of other things. It’s our house and our home, we don’t want to be guests in our home. I knew that to buy the stadium back we needed £16m.

'I want the stadium, we need to concentrate our energy on the club. It’s not agreed, we have the option to buy it and, if we try after November, it will cost more.'

Business: The deeds to Elland Road are owned by Teak Commercial Limited

The deeds to Elland Road are owned by Teak Commercial Limited, a firm based in the British Virgin Islands. Leeds are paying £1.4m in annual rent at the stadium but that sum rises by a percentage every year.

Benito Carbone has recently left his position of development coach at the club because of 'family reasons'.
