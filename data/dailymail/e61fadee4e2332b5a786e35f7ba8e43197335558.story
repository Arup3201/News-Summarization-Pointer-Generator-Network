Almost a fifth of us are so demanding we expect hourly contact from our other halves, a new study has revealed.

And nearly a third of Brits (30 per cent) say they become 'very angry' if they get ignored by a friend or partner.

But research released today indicates that more than half of people (53 per cent) are more upset and angry when ignored by a business.

The new study, carried out be Energy supplier E.ON, shows how we now value similar attributes in both business and personal relationships - with trust topping the list of qualities we look for.

It found the most important attributes for maintaining strong relationships with friends and partners are are trust (71 per cent), loyalty (55 per cent) and humour (47 per cent).

Meanwhile the attributes people see as most important when it comes to companies are trust (60 per cent), honesty (53 per cent) and loyalty (42 per cent). 

The study indicated how communication is a huge factor with both personal and business relationships.

Almost a quarter (22 per cent) feel poor communication is the cause of previous relationship breakdowns.

One in six Brits (16 per cent) even expect hourly contact from their other halves.

And despite almost a third (29 per cent) frequently changing their romantic relationships, almost half (40 per cent) have stayed with their energy supplier for five years or more.

The study also showed the companies and businesses people feel strong ties to.

When it comes to business relationships, water companies (2 per cent) are the organisations we are least likely to feel strong ties to.

This is closely followed by councils (3 per cent) and energy providers (4 per cent).

Supermarkets (18 per cent), banks (16 per cent) and sports teams (15 per cent) are the organisations we have the strongest relationships with.

Dr Lynda Shaw, Psychologist and Relationship Expert, said: 'When forming any type of relationship, trust is crucial - whether it's with a romantic interest, hairdresser or an energy company.

'Trust stimulates the hormone oxytocin in the brain and this enhances trust.

This wonderful feedback loop aids bonding and loyalty.

'It is however, also known to strengthen social memories which means that when we're let down by those in whom we've placed our trust, the effect is amplified.

'That's why it's so important to gain trust and keep it.'

Fiona Stark, Corporate Affairs Director at E.ON, said: 'Our research shows that trust is the most important trait in both personal and business relationships.

'Distrust is the most frequent cause of relationships breaking down.'
