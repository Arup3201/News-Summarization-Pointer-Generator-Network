Nothing has stopped Nathan Charles from fulfilling his lifelong dream of starting with the Wallabies tonight– not even taking 28 tablets each day to manage his Cystic Fibrosis.

The Western Force hooker’s parents were told when Charles was just three months-old that he would be lucky to live until he was 10.

But the 25-year-old’s positive attitude and sheer determination has seen him prove the medical professionals wrong as he gears up for the biggest day of his life when he faces the New Zealand All Blacks in the Bledisloe Cup clash on Saturday night.

Charles’ blatant refusal to allow his condition to impact on his life, including taking large amounts medication daily, has paid off immeasurably.

‘I just manage it on the side and not let it affect my on field performance,’ he said.

He credits his parents for instilling in him that there was no reason why he couldn’t live a normal life when growing up in Glenhaven in northwest Sydney.

‘You’re always influenced by the way you are grown up - my parents brought me up like that’ he said.

‘They always said I could do whatever I want and not let anything get in the way so that’s the attitude I’ve adopted.’

Not one to shy away from the occasional beer or takeaway meal, Charles insists that his diet is no different to any other professional rugby player.

‘I have everything in moderation with food and with drinking as well - I’m not extremely anal about what I have and I still enjoy myself,’ he said.

‘I’m a very healthy active person – I don’t smoke and don’t drink a hell of a lot and I’m just always making sure I'm quite hygenic so I don’t pick up any other bug or infections.’

Learning to listen to his body and understand his condition has been paramount for Charles maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

If Charles gets run-down he has to act quickly to prevent an infection setting in by taking further medication.

‘It’s about being proactive so if you get the first little sniffle or something you jump on it straight away – it’s about knowing your body and what works best with it – knowledge is power I guess,’ he said.

‘If I get a simple cold it always leads into something else – it’s a snowball effect so that’s why I’m always very hygenic and a bit of a clean freak in that regard.’

‘When I was younger my parents did most things for me but now I’ve grown up I have to understand what’s going on with my body and what’s happening so it’s been a bit of learning curve for me as well.’

The Cystic Fibrosis ambassador said being a professional athlete helps his condition which mostly affects the lungs and gives sufferers huge difficulty breathing.

‘I like to make sure my lungs get a good workout regularly activity-wise which is one of the keys to keeping healthy this whole time so I’m always making sure I’m very active.’

Charles has acquired strict mental discipline over the past four years as a professional player.

‘I keep my mind pretty clear and just focus on the things I need to like getting all of the patterns and players and knowledge down pat and get myself physically ready for the game and then come tomorrow I’m sure I’ll be buzzing a bit more,’ he said.

‘You pick things up along the way over the years and learn how to manage yourself,  so I have to keep myself calm and collected and not let myself get over-awed by the occasion and not play the game before it’s actually been played.’

Starting to play rugby as a six-year-old, Charles never doubted that one day he would be representing his country in rugby.

‘You have to believe it’s going to happen if you want to get there. It’s been in my blood since birth,’ he said.

‘I love being with the boys and I just love playing the game.’
