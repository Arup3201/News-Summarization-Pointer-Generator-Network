The shrubs and bushes around Adrian Woodyatt’s home got so out of control they were in danger of enveloping his semi.

Creepers had already begun to climb over the car on his drive when neighbours – angry that he was dragging down the tone of the street – decided enough was enough.

And yesterday the homeowner was counting the cost of failing to get out his shears when a court fined him £600.

Adrian Woodyatt, 44, was handed several 
warning notices by his local council after neighbours complained that his front and back gardens were overgrown. He failed to reply to the notices and let his garden grow more

Neighbours of Woodyatt in Gloucester 
first complained to the city council about the state of his front and 
rear gardens last October as the shrubs reached 15ft tall.

Prosecutor Elaine Bell told Gloucester
magistrates’ court that Woodyatt, 44, failed to respond to two council 
letters asking him to cut back the front and  rear gardens.

She added: ‘Due to the detrimental 
impact upon the neighbouring properties a section 215 notice under the 
Town and Country Planning Act 1990 was served on January 20. The notice 
requires specific works to be carried out. By June 6  these works had 
not been carried out.’

Now the garden has become so overgrown that the owner has been fined in court

Miss Bell said that further visits had been carried out by the council and the bushes were seen to be  getting worse.

Woodyatt, who lives at another 
property on the same road, was not present in court yesterday as 
District Judge Joti Boparai found the case proven in his absence.

He was fined £600 and ordered to pay 
£2,055 costs and a £15 victim surcharge.

Court handed Woodyatt a £600 fine and ordered him to pay £2,055 in costs

Council officers visited for a final time in June
this year when it was found that conditions had still not improved

Woodyatt was ordered to hand over more than £2600 - most of which is to repay the cost of investigating him

The bushes are so overgrown that they almost block out the light in the first floor windows

City council planning official 
Andy Birchley said: ‘We hope that publicity of such cases will be a 
deterrent to others and give some peace of mind to neighbours.’

Woodyatt yesterday claimed he didn’t 
know he was meant to be in court and described the ruling as ‘totally 
unfair’. He said: ‘I am angry and disappointed. A lot of my time has 
been taken up working and looking after my elderly mother who is not 
well at the moment. I will be appealing.’

Sentencing Woodyatt, Judge Joti Boparai 
said she was satisfied the council 
had given him enough chances

The bushes were so overgrown that this recycling bin nearly disappeared from view
