When Manchester United’s traumatic campaign under David Moyes shuddered to its lowest depths last season, there was a theory circulating that the on-field turmoil may have very serious ramifications for the club’s off-field credentials.

There was certainly some substance to this suggestion. The sliding share prices - from just under 19p before Sir Alex Ferguson’s retirement to hovering around 14p during the darkest moments of Moyes’ reign in February this year - demonstrated concrete proof of that.

Without Ferguson holding the reins of power at Old Trafford, questions were asked. He was the club’s most reliable asset, a guarantee of glory. Investors lost confidence. Some season ticket holders will have privately pondered whether the yearly investment was still worth the trouble.

The football was dire and the results were unacceptable. In six games against Manchester City, Liverpool and Everton, United’s aggregate score was 1-14. There would be no Champions League football for at least one year.

So how can it be, just two months after the curtain came down on United’s worst league finish in 24 years that the club were able to announce an extraordinary, record-breaking £750million decade-long kit deal with adidas?

The figures are truly remarkable. This agreement more than doubles the £31m that Real Madrid, the previous biggest recipient, are thought to receive a year from the German firm.

The £75m per year that United will receive from adidas alone is only narrowly less than the £76m turnover that Sunderland posted in 2012-13 season. In the same year, Aston Villa recorded £83.7m turnover. It offers some idea of the now obscene financial might of Manchester United.

This, of course, only takes into account United’s deal with adidas. United will also receive £51m annually from shirt sponsors Chevrolet for the next seven years as well as a £17m windfall per year from AON, who have purchased the rights to plaster their name across the club’s training kit, while they also sponsor the Carrington training ground. Only on Wednesday did United announce yet another sponsorship, this time with international food brand Nissin.

How much? AON pay £17m-a-year to sponsor the Carrington complex and the club's training kit

These three principal sponsorship deals will combine to provide United with an annual income in excess of £140m, dwarfing the turnover of 14 Premier League clubs.

Perversely, it would seem that United’s dismal dalliance with Moyes has, if anything, only amplified the intrigue and lure that surrounds this famous football club.

Last week, United launched ‘REUNITED’, essentially a glorified corporate event for the friendly match against Valencia in August that will mark Louis van Gaal’s first match at Old Trafford. This is emblematic of the brand that United are now trying to promote. A club clawing its way back to the peak of the mountain, ambitious and determined to return to the pinnacle of the sport in a brave, new era under Van Gaal.

It only underlines just how important the decision to part with Moyes had become. It was not taken lightly but it was incredibly necessary. A wave of optimism, boosted by the performance of Van Gaal at the World Cup and arrivals of Luke Shaw and Ander Herrera, is now sweeping through Old Trafford.

Looking bleak: The financials behind the club were on the slide with David Moyes in charge last season

United wore their poker faces and played a high-stakes game of negotiating to secure this landmark deal, holding lengthy discussions with Nike, Puma and Uniqlo - a Japanese firm - before eventually agreeing the contract with adidas. United may still come to an arrangement with Uniqlo in the coming year, further maximising their revenue potential and expanding the brand in the Far East.

Even despite concerns surrounding the team’s performances, Ed Woodward had the gumption to allow the Nike deal to run down and the increasing variety of brands on show at the club’s Carrington training ground was seen by the company as a hostile act. Now, of course, he can reflect with pride. But what if? What if Moyes had been kept on?

Would adidas have risked so much if Moyes had remained in charge? We may never know but nobody can deny the spectre of doom that had engulfed Old Trafford in those final, tortuous months of last season. Perception is everything in the modern world of business and companies want to be associated with clubs that evoke confidence and self-belief.

Manchester United under Van Gaal has the look of a force to be reckoned with, before a ball has even be kicked.  

Decent move: Chief executive Ed Woodward let Nike's deal to run down in favour of a more lucrative contract

Woodward is the brains behind the commercial operation at Old Trafford, the man who, along with Richard Arnold, has worked hard to service the club’s debt by extending United’s reach to Thai beer, Indian tyres, American watches and Japanese paint, to mention four of the 28 sponsors listed on the club’s website. The majority of these are worth around £2m to United but it all adds up a remarkable annual income.

Woodward, an Essex boy, is tremendously close to the Glazer family, speaking almost daily with Joel Glazer and he was one of those investment bankers - working for JP Morgan at the time - that pushed through the takeover in 2005.

The Glazers will feel that their prodigy is now proving his worth in the big job at United, despite the teething issues that he suffered last summer after taking over from David Gill.

Football should never be judged by the spreadsheet but if the on-field showings can mirror the rosy picture now adorning Woodward’s financial charts, then Manchester United supporters may be in for a very exciting season indeed.
