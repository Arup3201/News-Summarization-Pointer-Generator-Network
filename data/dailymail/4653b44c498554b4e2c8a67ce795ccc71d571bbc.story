Looking at TV footage of the Lindo Wing at London’s St Mary’s Hospital, chosen by the Duchess of Cambridge for the birth of her first child, I couldn’t help but smile.

Seeing it brings memories flooding back of the six days I spent there when I became a first-time mother 13 years ago. Terrified and totally unprepared for childbirth on my arrival, I experienced warmth, kindness and love there.

When I left with my new baby, I was set up for life. Quite simply, the Lindo taught me everything I needed to be a mother. It’s the best baby boot camp in the world.

The secrets of the Lindo are not high-tech. Indeed, they’re unorthodox: from red wine for dinner and a surprising use for grated carrots to grandmotherly care and a constant supply of cabbage leaves. 

I never expected to give birth at the private hospital favoured by royals. I was fortunate my father-in-law insisted on paying the cost.

The Lindo is the specialist private maternity and obstetrician unit at St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington, West London. Princess Diana gave birth to William and Harry there.

A normal delivery sets you back at least £6,000, but costs can spiral to an eye-watering £10,000 if you need a Caesarean section, as I did.

What do you get for that? Well, there’s a TV, jewellery safe and fridge in every room, and the food and wine list is restaurant standard. But what makes the Lindo unique is the exclusive attention of the most skilled obstetricians in the country.

Kate has been attended by Alan Farthing, the Queen’s gynaecologist. From the moment she arrived at the Lindo, she will have been lavished with care by a team of dedicated nurses and midwives.

The practical, old-fashioned tenets I was taught there — such as introducing a strict routine with my baby from day one — haven’t just helped me raise confident, happy children, they’ve also helped make us a happy, united family.

A designated midwife tended me throughout my stay. She helped turn me and my husband from a frightened couple into confident parents.

Max, a photographer, and I met at the newspaper where I was an executive: our son Zac was conceived on our wedding night.

Three months into my pregnancy, I put myself under the care of obstetrician Guy Thorpe-Beeston, who shares consulting rooms in Harley Street with Alan Farthing. He recommended I book the Lindo.

I saw Mr Thorpe-Beeston every two weeks and my pregnancy went smoothly. I didn’t read a single baby book or attend an antenatal class, having decided to leave all that until my maternity leave.

Zac was due on May 17, 2000, and in early April I stopped working, preparing to put my feet up and start reading baby books. I’d not even finished the first chapter when, six days later, on April 27, my waters broke.

Trying to control my rising panic, I rang Mr Thorpe-Beeston, who urged me to go straight to the Lindo. It took 12 minutes to get there — the longest 12 minutes of my life.

The huge wooden doors opened and a nurse in a navy uniform and sensible shoes greeted me with a warm smile. She took my arm and guided me gently inside. ‘It’s Claire, isn’t it?’ she said. ‘I’m looking after you and I promise you’ll be absolutely fine. You need some rest before the baby comes.’

In that second, my fear floated away and this lovely middle-aged woman became my guardian angel.

By the time Mr Thorpe-Beeston arrived at 11pm, I was tucked up in soft white sheets, with fresh flowers on my bedside table.

My room was just how I imagine NHS maternity units used to be, with everything spotless.

Hooked up to monitors and checked constantly, the hours passed in a blur as I drifted in and out of sleep, desperately hoping the contractions would start. But they didn’t.

I’d been there for more than 24 hours when I was told I’d need a Caesarean. The baby was vulnerable to infection without his sac of amniotic fluid to protect him.

Squeezing my hand, the midwife reassured me: ‘It will all work out well. You’ll soon have the loveliest baby in your arms.’

Our son was born at 4.16am on April 29. Though he was three weeks premature, he weighed a healthy 6lb 1oz. But he was so fragile I was allowed to hold him for only a few minutes before he was taken to the intensive care unit.

The nurses comforted me until, 12 hours later, he was back in my arms. And then it hit me that I was responsible for the tiny creature I was cradling. I felt a mixture of unbelievable joy and terror.

But that’s when the Lindo comes into its own. I was put in the care of Mary — a Mary Poppins in her mid-60s who had more experience than an army of grannies. I was guided through everything, from what I should eat to produce the best breast milk to bedtime rituals.

In order to speed up the production of milk and reduce swelling of the breasts, Mary had shown me how to place cabbage leaves inside my bra. It worked a treat and I was able to feed him within hours.

As Zac was premature, Mary advised me to feed him for 15 minutes from each breast every three hours. As he gained weight, I was to increase this to every four hours. This old-fashioned routine worked like a charm. He fed easily and slept beautifully.

She also showed me a great trick to prevent my breasts getting sore — sleeping with grated carrot inside my bra. The carrot toughened up the nipples, meaning that when Zac was placed on my breast in the morning it didn’t hurt.

Mary instructed me and Max how to wind our baby by putting him across our knees, then gently rubbing his back. Her lessons were invaluable: Zac never had colic.

She also advised me to sleep when Zac took his nap. ‘Your body needs to rest in order to produce good milk,’ she said. I carried on this ritual until I went back to work when he was ten months old.

Perhaps the best thing about the Lindo is the way it forges a bond between father and baby.

Every day, Max and I had lessons together in the creche. Mary insisted we took turns changing nappies and cleaning Zac’s bottom, using dampened cotton wool pads rather than baby wipes, which can be too harsh.

Best of all, Mary suggested Max make a habit of bathing Zac while I rested. ‘It will be your special time with him,’ she said.

I can’t thank her enough. Max never felt pushed out and would rush home to be with Zac. Hearing our son gurgle with glee as his father bathed him was magical.

I expect Lindo staff will be sending out Prince William to buy a case of expensive red wine — not for him, but for Kate.

‘Mummy needs to drink half a glass of good red wine every evening with her supper,’ Mary told Max.

‘It will relax her, so she produces lots of lovely milk for Zac’s last feed of the day. That will help him sleep through the night.’

When I walked down the steps of the Lindo with five-day-old Zac in my arms, it was a wrench to leave, but I knew I’d been given something precious — instruction in how to be a good mother.
