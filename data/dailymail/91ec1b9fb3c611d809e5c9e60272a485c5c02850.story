Doctors and nurses should apologise to patients when mistakes are made to win back trust in the NHS, the Health Secretary has said.

Jeremy Hunt said NHS staff had become ‘defensive’ and were inclined not to say sorry to patients and relatives for fear of being sued.

New guidance sent to the hospitals in England and Wales tells staff that saying sorry is not admitting legal liability but is ‘the right thing to do’.

Mr Hunt said he would like to see ‘an open NHS culture’ that ‘learns when things go wrong’.

He told The Telegraph: ‘Saying sorry and supporting patients and their families when they have experienced harm is a really important part of this. It’s great to see staff being supported to do the right thing.

‘Sadly, under the last Government a closed and defensive culture developed in parts of the NHS. We are transforming this culture through a new transparency drive in our hospitals.’

To address these concerns – including the Mid Staffordshire scandal where 1,200 patients died – the NHS Litigation Authority (NHS LA) has produced a four-page leaflet for staff entitled ‘saying sorry’.

It says a face-to-face apology must be given as soon as an incident has occurred.

‘A written apology, which clearly states the healthcare organisation is sorry for the suffering and distress resulting from the incident, must also be given,’ it says.

The leaflet explains that saying sorry is not an admission of liability, adding: ‘The NHS LA is not an insurer and we will never withhold cover for a claim because an apology or explanation has been given. ‘

Officials want to prevent a repeat of the poor care and culture at Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust where 1,200 patients died

Catherine Dixon, chief executive of the NHS LA, said: ‘Saying sorry is the human and moral thing to do, we won’t say we’re not going to cover you because you’ve said sorry.

‘In cases where people perhaps bring a claim out of frustration, because they don’t feel that they’ve been given an explanation or that their complaints have been heard, an apology may make them less likely to pursue an action.

‘We actively support organisations being open, transparent and candid with their patients. We have seen some cases where that hasn’t happened in the NHS. It’s important that we create and support the right culture. It can win back people’s trust.’

The amount set aside by the NHS to compensate patients for medical blunders has soared by nearly a quarter between 2012 and 2013.

A total of £22.7billion has been reserved to deal with thousands of clinical negligence claims. The number of claims rose by 11 per cent in 2012 to 10,129 in 2013 with some payouts of around £5million.

The figures, published in the annual report of the NHS Litigation Authority, are an estimate based on the number of claims the NHS believes it will be unable to defend, how severe errors are, and how much victims should receive.

The report shows that by 2012/13, the estimate had risen to £22.7billion, up 22 per cent from £18.6billion.

Official figures show that 104 negligence claims have succeeded against the Mid Staffordshire NHS trust over the past four years.
