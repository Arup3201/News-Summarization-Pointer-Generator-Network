Distinctive looinkg: Johnathan Schmidt, 29, cut another man with a knife

A man who is known to be the founder of a racist, neo-Nazi, skinhead gang has been arrested by police for cutting a man with a knife.

Police in California had no identifying 29-year-old Jonathan Schmidt.

After a fight occurred at a bar on Sunday night in Riverside County when before they finally tracked down the distinctive-looking Schmidt.

According to the Riverside County Sheriff's office,Schmidt, 29, cut another man with a knife.

It happened after the victim was attempting to stop a fight involving others.

After Schmidt fled the area in a dark green Ford Explorer, officers had no trouble tracking him down and pulling him over.

Police officers determined that Schmidt had attacked the victim and several others at the establishment.

Schmidt was arrested for assault with a deadly weapon and battery.

This is not the first time Schmidt has been in trouble with the law.

In January he was accused of stomping on a man's face in which the victim suffered a broken skull and lost several teeth but a jury found him not guilty.

It is known that Schmidt is part of Die Auserwählten, a little-known racist skinhead gang making a name for itself in mayhem and murder.

Schmidt is the founder of Die Auserwählten, which is also known as Crew 41.

Its German name translates, more or less, as 'the chosen' or 'the favored few.'

Schmidt, whose face is a mask of tattoos displaying his hate and his sorrow, lives in south-central Nebraska.

Schmidt has an exceedingly distinctive facial appearance. His face is covered in tattoos, including '5150,' police code for someone involuntarily committed to a mental institution, 'FYL' for “f*** your life,' “RIP Donny Boi,' a tribute to a skinhead tattoo artist killed by California police during a shootout earlier in July, and runes, or medieval Germanic letters, on his left eyebrow that spell out 'Hate.'
