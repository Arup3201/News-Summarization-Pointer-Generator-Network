Apple Inc has approved another $30 billion in share buybacks till the end of 2015 and authorized a rarely seen seven-for-one stock split, addressing calls to share more of its cash hoard while broadening the stock's appeal to individual investors.

Apple's stock price over the last five years: The firm has faced fears the death of co-founder Steve Jobs would stall innovation. However, Apple's stock soared by nearly 8 percent in extended trading after the latest results came out.

 Analysts projected iPad sales would reach 19.7 million, an only marginal increase from the 19.5 million iPads sold during the same time period in 2013.

In fact, Apple sold 16.35 million iPads, a drop of roughly 16.4 percent since last year.

The moves are meant to appease investors as the firm reports slowing revenue growth.Revenue was $45.6bn, a 4.6% increase from the same period a year ago.

'We're very proud of our quarterly results, especially our strong iPhone sales and record revenue from services,' said chief executive Tim Cook in a statement.

He also hinted the firm still had major product announcement to come this year.

'We’re eagerly looking forward to introducing more new products and services that only Apple could bring to market.'

The firm is rumoured to be introducing its iWatch and possible a new version of its Apple TV in June.

Tim Cook revealed the firm's current TV box is selling well,' he said.

'We've now sold about 20m Apple TVs.

'We've got a pretty large install base there.

'I'm feeling quite good about that business and where it can go.

Apple also plans to buy back an additional $30 billion of its stock, raise its quarterly dividend by 8 percent and split its stock for the first time in nine years.

The commitment announced Wednesday as part of Apple's fiscal second-quarter earnings report expands on the company's previous pledge to spend $60 billion on stock buybacks by the end of next year.

The company is now earmarking $90 billion for buybacks during that time frame.

Apple Inc. also is raising its quarterly dividend to $3.29 per share as part its effort to funnel more money to stockholders.

The company also will execute an unusual seven-for-one stock split in early June.

The move will dramatically decrease the nominal value of Apple's stock, which closed Wednesday at $524.75, though the total value of the company shouldn't change from the split.

Apple's stock soared by nearly 8 percent in extended trading after the news came out.

The firm's latest results reveal iPad sales slipped 16 percent from last year to about 16.4 million tablets.

The slowdown in revenue growth has prompted investors to wonder whether the company has lost its innovative power since the death of Steve Jobs.

The results for the first three months of the year illustrated how Apple Inc. can afford to spend so much money on its own stock.

Apple's earnings rose 7 percent to $10.2 billion, or $11.62 per share, an amount that exceeds what most technology companies make in an entire year.

Revenue climbed by 5 percent to $45.6 billion.

The Cupertino, Calif., company's quarterly revenue growth has been stuck between 1 percent and 6 percent for the past year.

Investors have been worried about the future of Apple since Jobs, its co-founder and chief visionary, died in October 2011.

The firm has turned some of its stores green to mark yesterday's Earth Day

Those worries have been compounded by the fierce competition that Apple faces in the mobile device market, particularly from Samsung Electronics Co.

The company's stock price has been about 25 percent below its peak of $705.07 reached 19 months ago.

The shares rose to $564.83 in Wednesday's extending trading, after closing earlier at $524.75.
