Raymond Betson, 52, was sentenced to 13 years in prison for attempted robbery at Maidstone Crown Court after a botched raid in Swanley, Kent

A notorious burglar who smashed into the wrong wall of a cash depot and ended up in an empty room has been jailed for 13 years.  

Raymond Betson, 52, tried to smash through the cash depot wall in an attempted multi-million pound raid with a stolen heavy-duty digger.

But he rammed through the wrong part of the building and led his gang of up to six men into an empty office.

Betson, who was the ringleader of a gang who tried to rob £350m of diamonds from the Millennium Dome in 2000, was found guilty of attempted robbery and jailed at Maidstone Crown Court.

He claimed in court he was a reformed character, but the jury disagreed. 

He said: 'You have heard evidence as to my character once I got out of jail. Yes, I was involved in the Dome caper but I have reformed since then. My family is more important to me.'

The raid took place at the Loomis cash depot in Swanley, Kent in the early hours of March 23, 2012. 

Betson and the gang used a stolen heavy-duty digger to smash down the wall, but broke down the wrong wall

Once the digger had broken through the wall, the gang, who were armed with baseball bats and white sacks, climbed over the rubble only to find an empty room.

They then entered a nearby warehouse - only to find that was empty too - and fled less than a minute later. They then botched their getaway when they had to abandon their car in a field when it got stuck in the mud.

After launching an investigation, Kent Police  found an abandoned Mitsubishi 4x4 in a field near a farm.

The vehicle had become grounded on a dip but inside officers found a two-way radio, a baseball bat and large white bags.

In a nearby bush, a balaclava, a snood and a running stopwatch were also found which allowed officers to calculate the time on the stopwatch and link it to the attempted robbery.

Betson, of Clifton Crescent, Folkestone, was arrested on December 5 when police found his DNA on a discarded balaclava at the scene.

On July 18, Betson was found guilty of attempted robbery at Maidstone Crown Court and today he was sentenced to 13 years in prison.

Betson tried to break into the Swanley cash depot only months after being released from jail for being the notorious ring leader of the Dome Raiders. 

He led a team of villains, who made headline news around the world, in an audacious smash-and-grab at the Dome, now known as the 02 arena.

The gang, which included Raymond Betson, 52, smashed through the wrong wall in a bungled raid 

The Dome Raiders smashed through the entrance to the Millennium Dome on a converted JCB digger dressed as terrorists with sledgehammers and smoke grenades and smashed open a glass cabinet. 

They boasted they would never be caught and prided themselves on their meticulous planning to keep one step ahead of the law, using state of the art technology and anti-surveillance devices. 

But just like the Dome itself, the raid ended in ignominious failure.

Betson was jailed in 2002 for a maximum of 18 years in prison for his part in the raid. His sentence was later reduced to 15 years.

Betson, 52, was part of the Dome Raiders that tried to steal £350m worth of diamonds in 2000

The Dome Raiders, led by Betson, were caught as they made a getaway by speedboat on the River Thames

Detective Inspector Rob Haines, of the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate, said: 'Betson wanted to make a lot of money quickly and was significantly involved in this botched robbery.

'The attempt displayed a level of violence, planning and organisation with the use of a digger, weapons such as baseball bats and a getaway vehicle.

'But what went from an armed robbery quickly turned into a farce because they knocked down the wrong wall, then searched an empty warehouse and managed to render the getaway vehicle useless as they fled the scene, discarding equipment nearby.

'I'm pleased the courts have recognised the seriousness of Betson's crime.' 

None of the other gang members have been caught but detectives say they will continue their search. In particular, Kent Police are seeking the whereabouts of 37-year old Karl Patrick Delaney.
