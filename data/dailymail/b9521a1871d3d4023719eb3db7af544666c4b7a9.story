Media magnate Rupert Murdoch is joined by sons James and Lachlan as well as daughter-in-law Sarah for a stroll around the swanky Sun Valley mountain resort on the fourth day of the Allen & Co conference.

The News Corp boss, 83, is just one of a bevy of billionaires at the media, finance and technology conference which has gained an almost mythical reputation for being an event where massive deals and mergers are struck.

Other guests include Microsoft founder Bill Gates, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, Twitter's Dick Costolo, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and former New York mayor Micheal Bloomberg.

Mr Murdoch appeared to be enjoying the sunshine as walked around the upscale Idaho mountain resort before hitching a ride on a golf cart.

Murdoch, the CEO of News Corporation and 21st Century Fox, the world’s second biggest media company, is rumoured to be considering a buyout of Time Warner.

Time Warner’s chief Jeffrey Bewkes was on hand to talk to Mr Murdoch at the conference which is known as the ‘summer camp for billionaires'.

The week long event, which is now in its 32nd year, is attended by many of the worlds wealthiest and most powerful executives from media, finance, and technology.

Media and technology CEOs and investors get together every year at the Allen & Co conference in Sun Valley for a week of mingling and deal-making.

This year, one of the more-debated 
topics was retired General Stanley McChrystal's push for a national 
service program for American teens, according to one prominent Sun 
Valley regular who sat in on a panel discussion.

McChrystal, former Commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, runs a pro-public service organization called the Franklin Project that counts Condoleezza Rice and Barbara Bush among its supporters, according to its website.

Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg is among the many billionaires at the conference

He made headlines in 2010, stepping down after Rolling Stone ran an article entitled 'The Runaway General,' quoting members of McChrystal's staff disparaging top White House officials and allies.

At the conference this week, he told his high-flying audience about the concept of a 'service year,' where youths sign up for a year of service in a variety of fields like education and conservation, and receive a modest stipend.

McChrystal has previously laid out plans for the initiative at conferences. He described national service as the 'big idea for our time' in a recent opinion piece for Politico.

NBC News' Tom Brokaw also interviewed McChrystal at the conference, two attendees said. Brokaw has previously talked about public service academies modeled on U.S. military academies.

Another hot issue at the conference? Many of the morning's panels featured education as their theme.

Sun Valley regular Jeff Weiner, chief executive of LinkedIn, has tweeted in favor of Code.org. Fellow guests, including Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Dropbox's Drew Houston, have spoken out publicly in favor of Code.org's mission to bring computer science education to schools across America.

The sources asked not to be named because the sessions are kept secret.
