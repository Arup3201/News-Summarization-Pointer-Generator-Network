Fernando Torres savoured his second debut for Atletico Madrid - claiming beating city rivals Real Madrid made it even more special.

Torres returned to the reigning La Liga champions,  where he enjoyed six goal laden years from 2001-2007, on loan from AC Milan for the remainder of the season.

Diego Simeone's side defeated Los Blancos 2-0 at the Vicente Calderon on Wednesday evening as Torres showed plenty of endeavour during his hour-long stint back at his boyhood club but failed to find the back of the net.

The 30-year-old clearly relished the return to his homeland as Atleti built a crucial first-leg advantage in the last 16 of the Copa del Rey. 

'We're very happy about the result and the atmosphere at the Vicente Calderon. Beating one of the world's best teams tastes good, it tastes better', the former Chelsea striker told Marca.

Atletico were by far the better side on Wednesday as they defeated rivals Real Madrid for the third successive time but Torres warned caution.

'We've done a great job. We'll have to perform just as well in the second leg,' added Torres. 'The job is far from done, we have to go to the Bernabeu knowing that a long 90 minutes lie ahead of us'.

When asked about his nerves on returning for his second debut at his boyhood club, Torres reponded: 'I had butterflies in my stomach during my unveiling and the match. I'm sure I'll have them for a long time'.
