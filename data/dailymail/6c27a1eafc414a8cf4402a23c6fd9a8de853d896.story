Scientists have revealed the eight biggest unanswered questions surrounding our universe.

They range from the mystery of dark matter, which makes up 73% of everything but has never been identified, to questions over why our Sun is so hot.

Formulated by the prestigious journal Science, have all been raised by the leading scientists in their field, each of whom also wrote an essay on the topic.

Most scientists agree that around three-quarters of the universe is missing - in the form of dark matter and dark energy, neither of which we have ever directly detected. This 3D 'map' of dark matter is basically a guess

However, is some cases even the scientists admit some mysteries are unlikely to ever be solved.

‘Each mystery is sure to be solved largely through astronomical 
observations—if it is solved: In at least one case, experts aren't sure 
that a seemingly simple question will ever be answered,’ Robert Coontz 
of the journal explained.

The biggest mystery is that of dark matter, which scientists admit may never be solved.

‘Part of the mystery is that we have no clue whether we will be able to 
ﬁnd an answer,’ says Simon White, an astrophysicist at the Max Planck 
Institute for Astrophysics in Garching, Germany

Huge parts of the history of the universe remain a complete mystery to us: For a few hundred thousand years after the Big Bang, electrons were stripped from atoms - we have no idea why

Dark Energy, which appears to make up 73% of everything that exists, and still it can’t be seen, or even measured. The energy is 'needed' to balance out the mathematics of the universe, but may not ever be able to be detected. 

Dark Matter, which is closely linked to Dark Energy, is the term used to
describe the ‘glue’ which holds everything in the universe together.

However, Adrian Cho, who wrote Science’s essay on the subject, believes 
that unlike dark energy, scientists stand a reasonably good chance of 
one day actually detecting a particle of the stuff.

Where are the missing baryons? Baryons are particles that make unormal  matter, but for some reason when adding up dark energy, dark 
matter and then leaving the rest to baryons, researchers can’t come up 
with a number that equals 100% - hence the mystery

Why do stars explode? Many of the processes of star formation and solar system formation are known - but researchers admit they still don’t really 
understand what goes on in a star when it explodes, forming what is 
known as a supernova.

What re-ionized the universe? For a few hundred thousand years after the 
Big Bang, electrons were stripped from atoms - we have no idea why. 

What is the source of the most energetic cosmic rays? We’re bombarded 
with them every day, yet researchers can’t agree on where they come 
from. Our atmosphere shields us from most of the rays. 

Why is our solar system so odd? Did our solar system form the way it
did by following logical steps, or was it all just chaos and chance? 
Nobody really knows.

Why is the sun's corona so hot? Those that study the sun still really don’t know. The corona is the furthest layer from the sun's core, but it's still incredibly hot - and the reasons for this strange 'layering' of our nearest star are still a mystery.
