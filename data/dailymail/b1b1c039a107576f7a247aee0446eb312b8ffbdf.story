London Mayor Boris Johnson cut a puzzled expression as he poked nervously at a dissected cow as he stopped off in Malaysia as part of his whistle-stop Far East Tour.

Mr Johnson nervously dug his hands in to the dissected animal to celebrate the opening of Epsom College in Kuala Lumpur, sister school of the prestigious independent Surrey school. 

The school hopes to cater for just under 1,000 pupils aged 11 to 18 and will follow a British curriculum.

Prior to his fumble with the cow, the Mayor of London had travelled cattle class with Kuala Lumpur mayor Ahmad Phesal Talib where he mingled enthusiastically with bemused commuters. 

He had kicked off the day with a meeting at city hall with the mayor and enjoyed a hearty local breakfast, before touring the sites of Kuala Lumpur. 

The cow dissection is the latest in the serious of peculiar photographs that have emerged of Mr Johnson on his six-day tour. 

He has also been snapped in a tight-fitting 'London is Great' T-shirt that showed off his portly frame, as well as chasing a lizard during a visit to Singapore Botanic Gardens.

Mr Johnson has visited the Far East as part of a UK Trade and Industry mission to boost trade and investment between the UK and Far East.

The senior Conservative has already met politicians, including Indonesian president Joko Widodo, and a raft of business leaders in four days spent in Singapore and Jakarta, Indonesia. 

He was the first British politician to have a substantial meeting with President Widodo since his inauguration.  

Mr Johnson, running for a return to Parliament in May, has been repeatedly mobbed by members of the public on his six-day trip, which will conclude tomorrow.

Today, the Mayor of London also met Malaysian Prime Minister Dato' Sri Mohammad Najib Abdul Razak.

The Southeast Asian country now has an economy worth $241bn (£153bn) and is predicted to reach developed economy status within the next six years.

Following newly introduced legislations which liberate Malaysia's architecture and engineering sectors, Mr Johnson said British businesses should take advantage of what is on offer.

'This fast developing nation is awash with new and exciting trade and investment opportunities crying out for London's great minds and expertise," he said.

'From great new feats of transport engineering to cutting edge design and architectural projects, I urge more British companies to get involved.'

Mr Johnson also defended the levels of affordable housing in the Malaysian-backed Battersea Power Station redevelopment. 

He said the 'affordable' element of the project, 15 per cent of the 3,000-plus properties, represented a gain of 600 discounted homes for Londoners.

Mr Johnson said: 'It's with that spearhead of Malaysian money coming in and redeveloping Battersea Power Station that we are able to get on and build 25,000 homes, the majority of which will be for people in the UK and loads of which will be affordable.

'Plus we are able to get the extension of the northern line...don't forget that out of this development we have got to fund the first extension of the tube we have seen in 25 years, it's not a cheap thing to do.

'We have to build two new stations and it will produce as I say overall in the area 25,000 new homes.

'I think 600 affordable homes is better than no affordable homes.' 

Mr Johnson said British businesses should take advantage of what is on offer in Malaysia 

Mr Johnson's defence of the project came as he met prime minister Razak in Kualar Lumpur to unveil Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG) as the architects designing Malaysia Square, the £8bn main public space at the power station project.

Mr Johnson said: 'We are now celebrating the arrival in London of Malaysia Square.

'If you think back 30 years ago or so, it was the Royal Bank of Ontario enabled the creation of Canada Square that led to what was then the greatest regeneration project anywhere in Europe - Canary Wharf.

'Nobody thought that could be done and now 30 years later it is another great Commonwealth country, Malaysia, that is allowing us to go ahead with an even more spectacular regeneration project.

'One no one ever thought could conceivably be done. Virtually all my life that site has been a shell, a ruin, a mockery of urban regeneration projects.

'You have pulled this off.' 

British firms have already made their mark in Malaysia with goods and services exports from UK companies worth about £3bn every year.

More than £40m worth of infrastructure contracts have already been won by British firms in Malaysia.
