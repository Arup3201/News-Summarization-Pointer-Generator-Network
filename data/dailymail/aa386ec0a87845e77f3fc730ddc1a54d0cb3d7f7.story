A pair of red-velvet thrones - poorly concealed beneath transparent plastic sheeting - are the giveaway to this magnificent floating palace.

It will carry the Queen along the length of the river Thames ahead of 1,000-strong flotilla of especially selected ships and boats to celebrate Diamond Jubilee.

She will be joined on the gilt-edged perches by  The Duke of Edinburgh and other members of the Royal Family in an event that will draw millions of people to London's river bank on Sunday.

And today hundreds of flowers from the Queen's gardens were painstakingly laid as the finishing touches to the waterborne extravaganza were being laid.

The flotilla will include vessels in all
 shapes and sizes, from narrow boats to steam boats and rowing boats to 
around 40 Dunkirk 'little ships' that evacuated Allied troops from 
French beaches in 1940.

Decked with flowers from the Queen's gardens, the Spirit of Chartwell will echo the richly-decorated royal barges of the 17th and 18th centuries and will be the centrepiece of the water-borne extravaganza which celebrates
 her 60-year reign and the nation's maritime heritage.

Dubbed a floating 'Savoy Hotel' The Spirit of Chartwell has 20 cabins and a deck fit for a Queen.

Up
 to a million people are expected to line the banks of the River Thames 
and nearby open spaces to watch a majestic 1,000-strong flotilla sail 
through London on Sunday.

And stars like Stevie Wonder, Sir

Victoria.

Almost six million Britons plan to throw a Jubilee party this weekend, according to a study.

A
 special visual tribute will see Diamond Jubilee Beacons light up the 
night sky across the UK on Monday, with more than 4,000 expected to be 
lit here and in the Commonwealth.

A St Paul’s Cathedral service of 
thanksgiving will be the highlight of Tuesday, ending with the Queen 
appearing on Buckingham Palace’s balcony to acknowledge the tens of 
thousands expected to fill The Mall.

Prime
 Minister David Cameron, the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince of Wales and 
other senior royals will join prominent individuals from the UK and 
abroad at many of the events.

Interviewed by Parliament’s The House
 magazine ahead of the celebrations, Mr Cameron said: 'I owe the Queen a
 huge debt for the wisdom she has shown me over the past couple of 
years. Six decades of service have given her an acute sense of what 
matters, what is permanent, and what is in Britain’s best interests.

'As her previous prime ministers have
 found, those insights are extremely useful. She is quite simply a 
remarkable person and a towering figure in our history. Long may she 
reign.'

However, the 
showpiece Thames boat pageant and thousands of Diamond Jubilee street 
parties could be washouts as forecasters predicted up to two inches of 
rain as British royalty’s jubilee and coronation weather 'curse' 
returns.

Revellers were 
told to pack umbrellas and coats as the Met Office forecast 
'disappointing' near-nationwide maximum temperatures of 10-12C - up to 
18C colder than last weekend - as other forecasters warned of freak 
summer frost and even snow.

Government weathermen said the Queen 
and 150,000 horse-racing fans’ trip to the Derby at Epsom, Surrey, 
tomorrow will see 18C sunny spells but also showers in the South. The 
North will be colder at 13C, but drier.

The
 Queen’s coronation on June 2, 1953, was an 11C washout. Buckingham 
Palace revellers built makeshift tents to shelter from downpours and 
strong northerly winds.

The
 Silver Jubilee on June 7, 1977, saw showers and 14C. Freak summer snow 
settled in the North and 20 people were rescued from Channel storms.

George
 VI suffered a cold, grey May 1937 coronation, while Queen Victoria’s 
June 1897 Diamond Jubilee was hit by hailstorms, thunder and lightning, 
leading meteorologist Philip Eden said.

'British kings and queens’ coronations and jubilees have a dreadful weather reputation,' Mr Eden said.

It will not be the first time the river Thames sees a flotilla of thousands of boats take to its waters in the wake of a royal barge.

In 1822 King George IV made the first state visit to Scotland by a reigning monarch since Charles II's coronation in January 1651.

The King left Greenwich, in London, followed by thousands of tributary vessels, in scenes immortalised by Robert Havell in his famous 1922 watercolour, The Embarkation of George IV for Scotland.

The Embarkation of George IV for Scotland in 1822: The watercolour, by Robert Havell, shows the royal yacht attended by city barges, steamers and a host of smaller vessels and huge crowds at Greenwich cheering the flotilla

In 1849 Prince Albert took two of his sons to the opening of the Royal Coal Exchange followed by thousands of Londoners eager to sail as close to the Royal Family as possible.

That barge was called Prince Frederick's Barge and, unlike the Spirit of Chartwell, courtiers had to row all the way from Parliament to the new exchange.

Prince Frederick's Barge was 
then sawn into three sections and stored in the Royal Barge House at 
Windsor Great Park for over 100 years before being brought to the 
Museum.
