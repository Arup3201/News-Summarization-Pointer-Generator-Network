A Royal Marine accused of executing a seriously-wounded Taliban prisoner wrote in his diary that he pleaded with his commander to shoot the stricken man, a court martial heard.

The 25-year-old serviceman, identified only as Marine C, described how he desired to kill the injured Afghan insurgent – and was ‘waiting to pop him’.

He recorded in his diary that his sergeant, known as Marine A, refused – then blasted the enemy captive in the chest at close range with his 9mm pistol.

Marine C wrote how he felt ‘mugged off’ that he had not been allowed to pull the trigger.

His barrister, Marcus Tregilgas-Davey QC, yesterday told the court martial that the diary should be treated ‘with caution’ as it was 'simply unreliable'.

He said Marine C and his comrades had been encouraged to write diaries by the Royal Navy as a ‘coping mechanism’ to deal with the stress of fighting on the frontline in Afghanistan.

Some entries had been ‘embellished, exaggerated and distorted,’ Mr Tregilgas-Davey told the seven-strong court martial board.

Marine C is on trial for murder along with two comrades, Marine A and B. C and B allegedly helped and encouraged Marine A to kill the detainee during a patrol in Helmand on September 15, 2011. All three deny the charges.

Film footage of the shooting, captured on a camera mounted on the helmet of Marine B, has been played to the hearing in Bulford, Wiltshire.

The victim was found with an AK47 assault rifle and grenade after an Apache helicopter blitzed him with cannon fire following an attack on a British base.

On the video, Marine C can be heard asking if he could shoot the wounded prisoner in the head and heart – but he dismissed this as ‘banter’ to defuse stressful situations.

Marine C has told the court martial how up to 20 comrades had already been killed or maimed by Taliban bombs and bullets by the day of the incident. Some victims’ blown off limbs had been hung in trees by insurgents as ‘trophies’.

In his closing statement, Mr Tregilgas-Davey said Marine C was the point man operating the Vallon bomb detector, sweeping the ground for IEDs.

It meant the married marine was most at risk of stepping on a booby-trap bomb.

He said: 'It is difficult to think of a more stressful, demanding job. He was physically exhausted, his nerves were frayed, he was jumping at every bang and loud noise.'

Referring to the diary, Mr Tregilgas-Davey said: ‘It is not supposed to be a near accurate account of events; in part it was a therapeutic aid, a way of releasing the stress that Marine C was under by putting his thoughts down on paper.

'Some things are factually accurate, some things have been embellished, exaggerated and distorted.

'It is venting the tensions and stresses of an operational tour, combining events and facts with emotions and feelings. That is a heady mix.'

He said it was just 'bravado' because Marine C was 'scared and angry'.

Mr Tregilgas-Davey said writing down feelings was a recognised psychological technique, outlined in a pamphlet called Royal Navy: Trauma And Resilience which was handed to all troops.

He said: ‘It seems a little harsh to encourage an individual to write down their feelings on combat stress and then to use these jottings against that individual.

'Don't condemn Marine C for a couple of pages of a diary written with hindsight, demonstrably false in some places, written as a way of coping with tensions and stresses, not an accurate chronicle of events.'

Mr Tregilgas-Davey said Marine C had been ordered away from the victim when he was shot so was ‘not present’.

He said: 'It was sudden spur-of-the-moment decision made by Marine A alone, without encouragement or assistance from Marine C.'

The court martial continues.
