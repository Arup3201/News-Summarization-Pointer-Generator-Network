Whether it's the bound lotus or the half frog, yoga poses can get you into a tangled mess.

Now a new mat aims to change that by offering users spoken and visual cues on how to best position their body – without the need for an instructor.

Described as the world's first smart yoga mat, the gadget also provides feedback by sending pressure data to an app on an Android or iOS device.

High-tech Yoga: Described as the world's first smart yoga mat, the gadget provides feedback on poses by sending pressure data to an app on an Android or iOS device

On the outside, the 'SmartMat' looks like an ordinary yoga mat and can be rolled up into a gym bag.

But beneath its outer foam is a grid of conductive fabric placed over what is known as piezo-resistive material. This material changes its electrical resistance when pressure is applied.

With the help of software, this allows the mat to know where a user is standing and how much weight is being exerted on each of its zones.

It also provide audio advice on breathing technique and hand position. 

'We built SmartMat because we wanted a way to receive personalised yoga instruction without having to go to an outside class or hire a private teacher,' said SmartMat Founder, Neyma Jahan.

'SmartMat synchs with and analyses each user via a unique calibration process, providing the kind of custom biofeedback once exclusive to private lessons.'

The Smartmat is the same size, consistency and rolls up like a 'regular yoga mat'.

It connects to a smartphone or tablet using bluetooth. 

The device calibrates to a users body and yoga abilities to determine the correct adjustments for that individual.

It's In-Class-Assist mode follows along to a users movements, recording those and offering real time adjustments either visually, via audio or both.

In Home Private mode, the user follows along to the program receiving adjustments on first alignment and then balance.

According to its Los-Angeles-based makers, if set-up correctly, the SmartMat can distinguish between 62 different yoga poses.  

A user begins by plugging in data on their weight, height and other body measurements into the mat.

The gadget will then take the user through a series of poses and suggest adjustments to determine their 'perfect pose'.

After this initial calibration, SmartMat will use the information to provide yoga recommendations during future sessions.

Users can also teach themselves new moves through downloadable lessons, and a 'Zen mode' can be switched on to get feedback later.

As well as sending data to phone or table, the SmartMat also has a device stand built in so that information on posture can be viewed while exercising.

SmartMat's creators are now using crowdfunding site Indiegogo to raise the $110,000 (£67,800) needed for production.

Users can currently pre-order one for a pledge of around $250-300 (£155-195) and shipment is expected for August next year.
