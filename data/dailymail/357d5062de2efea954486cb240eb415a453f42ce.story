Jonathan Agnew has quit Twitter after the fallout from the Kevin Pietersen row and an argument with the cricket star's wife. 

The 54-year-old got into a heated debate with  Jessica Taylor on the social media site, leading to him receiving a torrent of abuse. The Test Match Special pundit then deleted his account.

Aggers wrote in his last tweet: 'Almost did this last night. This is not what Twitter was when I joined. I will now leave it to the bullies and trolls. Shame.'

Jonathan Agnew has quit Twitter in the wake of a row with Kevin Pietersen's wife, Jessica Taylor

Pietersen's wife said she had 'every right' to stand up for her family on the social media site

The former Leicestershire bowler spoke on Tuesday on Test Match Special about Pietersen's recent behaviour and the fallout from his controversial new book, while the South African born batsmen listened in from a BBC studio.

Aggers suggested that while the 34-year-old pretended to be a strong, confident individual he was in fact 'an anxious, nervous character.' 

He then spoke about the infamous parody Twitter account @KPGenius, which a number of England players were said to be involved in.  

Following the incident, Agnew and Taylor argued on Twitter about whether the account was in fact run by Pietersen's team-mates with the former eventually telling the Liberty X singer to 'lose the attitude'.

Taylor said: 'I'm not fighting anyone's battles. As a wife and mother I have every right to defend my family when I see fit. I make no apologies for that.'

The argument between Pietersen's wife and Agnew centred around the parody Twitter account @KPGenius

Alec Stewart said he was told that three senior England players had access to the @KPGenius account
