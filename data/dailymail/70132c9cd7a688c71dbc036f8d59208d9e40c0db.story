Packets of an unidentified
yellow powder were sent to five western consulates in Istanbul, Turkey on Friday, officials said, prompting security alerts following
two militant attacks in Canada this week.

Consulates of the United States, Canada, France, Germany and
Belgium received suspicious packages, the officials said. It was
not immediately clear what the powder was and Turkish officials
said results of tests on them were due on Monday.

Sixteen people were hospitalized as a precaution from three
different embassies, including 10 from the Canadian consulate,
the Turkish Ministry of Health said in a statement.

A hospital
treating the Canadians said the Consul General was among them.

Getting ready: Chemical experts prepare enter the German Consulate in Istanbul. Suspicious envelopes containing a yellow powder were sent to the Belgian, Canadian, American, French and German consulates

Lockdown: A Turkish policeman stands guard outside the German Consulate after the alert on Friday

One Canadian consulate employee came into direct contact
with the package and six others had indirect exposure, Turkey's
disaster management agency AFAD said in a statement.

German and Belgian consular staff were also being monitored
in hospital, the Ministry of Health added.

A U.S. embassy spokesman confirmed the Consulate General had
 received a 'suspicious' envelope containing a powder, but said
it was dealt with according to security protocols and the
consulate remained open.

Istanbul's governor later confirmed the French consulate had
also received a similar package.

Fears: Members of the Turkey's disaster management agency (AFAD) carry bags from the Canadian Consulate in Istanbul on Friday after an unidentified yellow powder was sent to the consulate and four others

Concerns: An ambulance pulls up outside the Canadian consulate in Istanbul. One Canadian consulate employee came into direct contact with the package while six others had indirect exposure

Targeted: Experts gather outside the French consulate. There was no immediate claim of responsibility

Still open: The U.S. consulate also received a 'suspicious' envelope containing a powder, but a spokesperson said it it was dealt with according to security protocols and the consulate, above, remained open

Teams decontaminated the Canadian and Belgium consulates and
were working on cleaning the German mission, AFAD spokesman
Dogan Eskinat said.

Other consulates and embassies were
reviewing their security arrangements.

'There was a package with some yellow powder, suspicious,
that was sent to the Canadian mission in Istanbul, it was sent
to a number of other foreign missions,' Canada's foreign affairs
minister John Baird said in Ottawa

'Out of an abundance of caution we've closed the mission
until we can ensure the safety of all our employees.'

Precautions: A member of the Disaster and Emergency Management Authority of Turkey disinfects the area in the front garden of the German Consulate. German staff are being monitored in hospital

In action: A Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Weapons Unit vehicle from Turkey's Prime Ministry Disaster and Emergency Management department is stationed outside the Belgian consulate

Checks: Chemical experts arrive at the German Consulate in Istanbul after the powder was found

Canadian consulates and embassies overseas have been on
heightened alert this week after two attacks in Canada.

Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, 32, a Canadian citizen and convert to
Islam, shot and killed a soldier stationed at the National War
Memorial in Ottawa on Wednesday before running into the nearby
parliament buildings. He was killed by guards in a flurry of
gunfire.

Two days earlier, Martin Rouleau, a 25-year-old convert to
Islam, drove over two Canadian soldiers in Quebec, killing one,
police said. He also was shot dead by security officers.
