Oldham Athletic were occupying a space that proved uncomfortable even for a company that manufactures gutters.

The club’s pursuit of Ched Evans, an option board members maintained they were continuing to discuss on Monday night, was too lowly a place for Verlin Rainwater Solutions. As it was for Mecca Bingo. Sign the convicted rapist, they both warned, and their sponsorship of the struggling League One outfit would be terminated.

This, it seems, was not Oldham’s greatest concern given the nominal sums of money involved. Far more worrying was the possible loss of Sports Direct’s £1million backing, and the fact that the company’s owner — Newcastle United’s Mike Ashley no less — was being urged by a police commissioner to pull the plug on the Oldham deal should Evans be given a route back into football at Boundary Park.

As Oldham discovered on Monday, this is what happens when you even entertain the idea of signing a footballer only recently released from prison for raping a young woman in a hotel room.

There is the public outcry that manifests itself in the form of a petition. Never mind that Oldham currently attract gates of around 4,000. More than 28,000 people had put their names to stopping Evans resume his football career by Monday night.

Then, of course, there are the politicians. Sheffield United and Hartlepool have already endured such a response, and it was now Oldham’s turn. There was a protest not just from local MP Debbie Abrahams but Labour leader Ed Miliband and shadow sports minister Clive Efford.

Efford called for the FA to intervene and reject Evans’s registration as a player. ‘There are many professions that people cannot return to after committing this sort of crime and football must be one of them,’ he said.

Like much of the country, Evans thought he was going back to work. After talks over the weekend he believed a club that could seriously use a striker of his ability — not least after a disastrous December that included a 7-0 thrashing by MK Dons — was prepared to take him on.

Board members, owner and chairman Simon Corney among them, appeared prepared for the inevitable backlash in the belief that the pros — a striker who scored 48 goals in 113 games for Sheffield United — outweighed the cons.

So for the first time in nearly three years, Evans thought he was going to be training with a squad of professional footballers again.

It would not have been the most glamorous of returns for a player who made 16 league appearances for Manchester City and has represented Wales 13 times. Not when a lack of facilities means the squad and staff change and shower at Boundary Park and make the three-mile journey to and from the training ground in a convoy that includes a kit van.

But professional football it remains, and on Sunday Evans was led to believe he was finally emerging from the wilderness. Albeit on a relatively modest £400 a week that some were suggesting was being covered by his fiancee’s millionaire father, who is also funding the legal fight to clear his name.

For Lee Johnson, at 33 the youngest manager in the Football League, it seemed a most unwelcome distraction. He handled himself well, facing the media when his employers and the club’s own media officer hid inside Boundary Park.

At one stage Johnson even emerged in the icy cold with some biscuits and then organised teas and coffees, apologising for the delay in issuing an official club statement.

Thanks to Johnson, Monday was not a complete PR disaster for a club that also once found a place for Lee Hughes, who served half of a six-year prison sentence for causing death by dangerous driving. 

Johnson, it is believed, was against bringing in Evans in the first place even if he did tell the media that he would ultimately support the board’s decision. Whatever the outcome of this sorry saga, his stock has certainly risen.

When Neil Joy, Oldham’s chief executive, finally emerged from his Boundary Park office at 4.30 afternoon, it was to deliver a holding statement. ‘We continue to have conversations,’ it read, before asking that the privacy of ‘stakeholders and partners’ be respected.

Clearly, they still want 26-year-old Evans and clearly they didn’t appreciate being pushed around. It seems they also didn’t appreciate Gordon Taylor’s apparent reluctance to attend a press conference as the chief executive of the PFA.

The PFA only represent their members but Oldham rather hoped Taylor would share the burden of responsibility at any possible unveiling. By Monday night, however, the far bigger issue concerned the intervention of Northumbria Police and Crime Commissioner Vera Baird.

Responding to reports that Ashley would not object to Oldham’s recruitment of Evans, Baird wrote to the billionaire owner of Newcastle United in the strongest possible terms by urging him to ‘withdraw Sports Direct sponsorship at the club’.

If Ashley bows to the pressure, Evans will once again find himself searching for an employer.
