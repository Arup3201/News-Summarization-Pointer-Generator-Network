A former Harrods dressmaker has told how her husband died after NHS 111 call centre workers failed to recognise the urgency of his condition.

Barbara Foster called the controversial helpline last Wednesday evening after Reg, her husband of 33 years, developed severe abdominal pains.

But staff who took the call wrongly categorised his case as 'not life-threatening' and the ambulance took more than three hours to arrive.

Mr Foster, 64, was eventually taken to the London Chest hospital where he later died from a cardiac arrest.

He had been suffering from a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, a tear to one of the major blood vessels which causes internal bleeding.

Although the condition has a high mortality rate, survival chances are far better the sooner a patient is given surgery to repair the tear.

If Mrs Foster, 73, had spoken  to a doctor or nurse rather than a call centre worker, they may have realised the urgency of his illness, especially given his medical history.

He suffered from high blood pressure – which would have put him at higher risk from an aneurism – and had undergone bypass surgery following a major heart attack in 2002.

With hindsight, Mrs Foster, from Hornchurch, Essex, regrets not calling 999 straight away. She says she called 111 shortly before 8pm but an ambulance did not arrive until after 11pm.

She said: 'I kept walking down the drive to see if anything was coming. Reg said, “don't bother them Babs, there's probably people more urgent than me”.'

After waiting almost an hour she dialled 999. 'They said, “You're on the list and an ambulance will get to you as soon as we've got one free”,' Mrs Foster said. This is because the case had been classed as 'non-life-threatening' by 111 staff.

'They told me they had got a lot of urgent cases. That's when I said I said I think he is an emergency. He was rolling backwards and forwards in severe pain.

'I just knew he was going to die.'

Mrs Foster's ordeal will prompt concerns that members of the public have been left confused as to whether to dial 999 or NHS 111.

At one point, Mrs Foster, a grandmother of two, said she was told off by the woman NHS 111 call centre worker for 'not listening'.

She said: 'I needed her to speak up a bit as she was so quiet. She said, “You're not listening to me.” I thought she was quite rude.'

Neither the area's NHS organisation Havering Clinical Commissioning group, nor the firm running 111 there were available for comment.

There are concerns 111, which  has replaced NHS Direct and  local out-of-hours GP numbers,  is putting lives at risk. A survey of 748 GPs and hospital doctors by Doctors.net found 70 per cent  want it scrapped completely,  while another 16 per cent say it should be withdrawn until problems are fixed.

Jane Cummings, chief nursing officer from NHS England, said: 'The vast majority of patients who use NHS 111 are getting a good service, although it is clear that some are not and this is unacceptable.'
