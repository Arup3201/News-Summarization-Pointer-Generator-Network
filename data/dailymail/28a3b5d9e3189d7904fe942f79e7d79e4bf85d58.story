A powerful solar flare blasting its way towards Earth could wreak havoc with communications  and power systems in the coming days.

Scientists have warned that the 'extreme' solar storm could affect power grids, satellites and radio transmissions when the flare arrives at the Earth's surface.

But they said they are not 'scared of this one', as the worst of its power looks like it will barely skim above the planet and not cause many problems.

Scientists have warned that the 'extreme' solar storm could affect power grids, satellites and radio transmissions when the flare arrives at the Earth's surface

The storm is moving medium-fast - about 2.5 million miles per hour - meaning the soonest it could arrive is early Friday.

Tom Berger, director of the Space Weather Prediction Center in Boulder, Colorado, said it has been several years since Earth has had a solar storm of this size coming from sunspots smack in the middle of the sun

The flare on the sun barely hits the 'extreme' on forecasters' scales, and with its worst effects missing Earth it is only looking 'potentially strong' at most when it arrives at Earth as a solar storm.

'There's been a giant magnetic explosion on the sun,' Berger explained. 'Because it's pointed right at us, we'll at least catch some of the cloud.'

Solar flares are violent explosions on the sun with an energy equivalent to tens of millions of hydrogen bombs

Sun flares expand the photogenic Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights, across Canada and the northern U.S.

Most flares occur around sunspots, where intense magnetic fields emerge from the Sun's surface

The cloud contains highly energized and magnetized plasma that can disrupt the Earth's magnetic sphere, and has been known to cause temporary power grid problems.

New calculations from satellite data show that the worst of the energetic particles streaming from the sun are likely go north or above Earth this time, Berger said yesterday.

A solar flare is a violent explosion on the sun with an energy equivalent to tens of millions of hydrogen bombs.

It occurs when energy stored in 'twisted' magnetic fields is suddenly released.

This produces a burst of radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum.

Most flares occur around sunspots, where intense magnetic fields emerge from the sun's surface into the corona.

They can be dangerous to humans, but the Earth's atmosphere absorbs most of the high-energy rays.

So while the power grid may see fluctuations because the storm will cause changes in Earth's magnetic field, it won't knock power systems off line.

It may cause slight disturbances in satellites and radio transmissions but nothing major.

'We're not scared of this one,' Berger added.

Solar storms occur often, especially during peaks in the solar cycle, and don't directly harm people.

Forecasters with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Space Weather Prediction Center yesterday said the flare already 'caused impacts to high-frequency radio communications on Earth today'.

'A coronal mass ejection (CME) associated with this event is likely, but further analysis is necessary to determine whether it will produce geomagnetic storming on Earth,' it added.

A CME contains billions of tons of energetic hydrogen and helium ions as well as protons and electrons ejected from the sun's surface.

On the plus side, sun flares expand the photogenic Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights, so more people in Canada and the northern U.S. will be able to enjoy nature's light show over the coming days.

The Northern Lights usually appear in the night sky in polar latitudes as shimmering green waves of light. The spectacle occurs when atoms in the Earth's high-altitude atmosphere collide with energetic charged particles from the sun.
