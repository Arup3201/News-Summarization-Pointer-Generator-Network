Security chiefs have thwarted an audacious attempt by Russian spies to steal information from the heart of Downing Street.

Mobile phone chargers and USB drives given to David Cameron’s staff as well as other foreign delegates at the G20 summit in Russia were ‘Trojan horses’ capable of sending data back to the Kremlin.

The devices contained bugs that could apparently capture valuable data from phones and computers.

Vladimir Putin welcomes David Cameron for the G20 summit - but were phone charger gifts at the event actually spying devices?

Downing Street confirmed last night that intelligence advisers warned No 10 staff not to use the gadgets because they suspected a plot by Russian security services

Downing
 Street confirmed last night that intelligence advisers warned No 10 
staff not to use the gadgets because they suspected a plot by Russian 
security services.

The Prime
 Minister’s official spokesman denied that Mr Cameron was given one of 
the items, but senior sources confirmed that they were handed to his 
aides.

According to reports 
in the Italian press, the German secret services discovered that the 
gadgets, given to delegates at the meeting of world leaders in St 
Petersburg last month, were able to retrieve data for use by the Russian
 secret services.

The G20 
conference took place in a climate of great diplomatic tension between 
Russia and the West. Only weeks before, the Kremlin had granted asylum 
to fugitive Edward Snowden, wanted for leaking security information 
about US surveillance to the Guardian.

At the same time, the US and France were at loggerheads with Russia over intervention in Syria.

The
 alarm was apparently first raised by EU President Herman Van Rompuy, 
who was suspicious of the Russians’ gifts. All participating governments
 were urged to ‘take every possible precaution’.

Mr Cameron’s spokesman said: ‘My understanding is that the Prime Minister didn’t receive a USB drive.’

But
 a senior Whitehall source said: ‘No one is naïve about gifts that are 
handed out like this. We’re not going to go around publicly accusing the
 Russians of spying but no one who was given one of these devices will 
have used it.

‘No 10 staff 
get routine security briefings before summits like this and are warned 
to be alive to attempts to access their phones.’

Who knows what: Senator Dianne Feinstein, who is the chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has called for a review of all spying programs after world leaders found out they were subject to NSA protocols

Downing
 Street staff are ordered not to take their personal mobile phones and 
iPhones on foreign trips. Instead, they are issued with specially 
encrypted BlackBerrys.

The 
plot was the most brazen by a foreign power since Chinese intelligence 
targeted Michael Jacobs, a climate change adviser to Gordon Brown, with a
 ‘honey trap’ during a trip to China in 2008.

After receiving the 
attentions of a glamorous female intelligence operative in a nightclub, 
Mr Jacobs realised he had lost his BlackBerry.

The new allegations were made by the Italian newspapers La Stampa and Corriere della Sera, quoting EU diplomatic sources.

‘Early
 analysis showed the USB drive and mobile phone charging cables gifted 
by the Russians to be Trojan horses – instruments capable of capturing 
data from computers and mobile phones,’ sources told Corriere della 
Sera.

Russia’s spymasters have already benefited from global secrets pouring in from Western whistleblowers.

Over
 the past five years, material such as the WikiLeaks cache including 
250,000 leaked embassy cables and nearly 500,000 Pentagon documents, and
 now the Snowden leaks, have exposed techniques used to keep the UK safe
 and put the lives of security services operatives and their families at
 risk.
