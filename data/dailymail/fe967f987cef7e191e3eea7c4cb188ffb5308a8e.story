A kitchen with a lavatory at one end – it would be hard to imagine a more unsanitary place to live.

This unappealing arrangement is what planning officers found when they investigated outbuildings that they suspected fell foul of planning laws.

These are the grotty living quarters in Cambridge of Jarek Sluka, a chef from the Czech republic who has been living in the UK for eight years

The Council's action in Cambridge comes at a time of growing controversy over the use of garden sheds to house low-paid immigrants in areas where property commands high prices.

The city has a large student population but East Anglia’s agriculture and food processing sectors have proved a strong magnet for thousands of Eastern European immigrants.

The influx has led property developers to rent out renovated garages and sheds.

Yesterday a chef from the Czech Republic said he has lived in another concrete outbuilding since May and said he was ‘very happy’ there.

Jarek Sluka, 32, who moved to Britain eight years ago, said: ‘When I come back from work it’s nice to be able to rest here. I don’t want to move and it is just nice to enjoy our quiet life here. It doesn’t bother me.’

The toilet-come-kitchen was found in this brick out building behind a semi-detached house

In a separate bungalow were bedrooms for two people which feature a Czech flag

Landlord Tony Waite clashed with his local authority when he built a back garden chalet bungalow with three bedrooms, a lounge, a kitchen and a bathroom on the site of an old garage.

The two ramshackle homes were built behind this property in Cambridge where there is a shortage of housing

But when council bosses told him they intended to take enforcement action, he removed the kitchen and placed it in a nearby outbuilding, which was already equipped with a toilet.

He claimed this showed that the new building’s residents used facilities in the main house and it was therefore not separate accommodation.

However, the plan failed and he has now been ordered to tear down the bungalow. He intends to appeal against the ruling.

Mr Waite, who has two tenants in the outhouse and two in the bungalow, claimed the toilet was installed for people working on the site and the kitchen was not properly fitted.

‘The kitchen was temporary and was moved into the shed holding the toilet so the tenants didn’t have to all use the kitchen in the main house,’ he said. ‘I intend to appeal and I will not let my tenants become homeless.’

Lib Dem councillor Sarah Brown said: ‘I have never seen anything like that in three-and-a-half years of evaluating planning applications and I hope it is a one-off.’

Labour councillor Lewis Herbert added: ‘There has to be controls to make sure these places are safe and reasonable, especially in a city where there’s such a shortage of accommodation that people will live wherever they can find.’

Earlier this year the Daily Mail published a map created with heat-imaging cameras that showed garden outbuildings in a London street where officials believe as many as 1,000 migrants could have been living secretly.

The discovery, in Hounslow, west London, led borough leaders to believe there may be 20,000 sheds rented out to 50,000 immigrants.
