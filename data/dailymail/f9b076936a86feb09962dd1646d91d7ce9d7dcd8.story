The government has spent nearly half a million dollars studying gay hook-up apps such as Grindr.

Columbia University was gifted $432,000 from The National Institutes of Health (NIH) to interview gay men about their use of GPS apps which tell the exact distance the user is from potential romantic partner.

'The overall study goal is to understand how sexual risk behaviors among men seeking men (MSM) may be facilitated by the nature of GPS-enabled smartphone applications, the way they are used, and the process by which sexual partnering occurs via smartphone applications,' reads the project description.

Grindr: Columbia University was gifted $432,000 from The National Institutes of Health (NIH) to interview gay men about their use of GPS apps like Grindr which tell the exact distance away of a potential romantic partner

The study includes 60 males, 25 percent of whom are HIV positive and all of whom come from different backgrounds.

'We will conduct in-depth qualitative interviews with 60 MSM (20 African American, 20 Latino, 20 White; 25% of whom are HIV-positive) who have utilized smartphone applications to meet sexual partners in the past 3 months,' explains the write-up on the NIH website.

Free Beacon reports that Karolynn Siegel, a professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia, is the leader of the study.

The app both studied the sexual arousal of men on GPS Apps such as Grindr and 'how and why smartphone applications are used for sexual partnering.'

The study aims to determine how men communicate and present themselves on the site and also measures their 'emotional states and impulsivity.'

The project also looked at 'smartphone-based sexual risk intervention.'

Since the Grindr app was created in 2009 it is the 'most popular all-male location-based social network out there,' according to the website.

Intervention: The project  looked at 'smartphone-based sexual risk intervention' as a final portion of the study

'With more than 5 million guys in 192 countries around the world—and approximately 10,000 more new users downloading the app every day—you’ll always find a new date, buddy, or friend on Grindr,' says the site. 

Apps for straight people exist as well with Tinder being the most popular. The NIH has not yet funded a study on the arousal of straight dating app users and possible sexual risks.

The Journal Sexually Transmitted Infections revealed study data this past summer about how both Grindr and Tinder increase the likelihood for STI's.

The study found the risk is higher for those who meet people through apps than for those who meet sexual partners online or in bars and clubs.

Overall, smartphone users were 23 per cent more likely to be infected with gonorrhoea and 35 per cent more likely to be infected with chlamydia. 

The study authors wrote: ‘Technological advances which improve the efficiency of meeting anonymous sexual partners may have the unintended effect of creating networks of individuals where users may be more likely to have sexually transmissible infections than other, relatively less efficient social networking methods.’

They added: ‘Technology is redefining sex on demand. Prevention programmes must learn how to effectively exploit the same technology, and keep pace with changing contemporary risk factors for [sexually transmitted infections] and HIV transmission.’
