An Italian Alpine village is being sold on Ebay for less than the price of a London flat.

Calsazio is nestled in the dramatic hills of northern Italy, near the Gran Paradiso National Park - but many of its 14 houses are abandoned and in urgent need of repair.

Now the village's remaining residents are banding together to sell their entire community for just £195,000 in the hope it will be turned into a tourist spot.

Yours for £195,000: The picturesque but dilapidated Alpine village of Calsazio has been listed on Ebay

Fancy a bid? The 'used' item must be picked up locally and unfortunately, refunds are not accepted

The cost - a 'Buy It Now' tag of 245,000 Euros - is less than half the average price of a flat in London, which stands at £475,000 according to the sales website Zoopla.

And it is around the same as the average cost of a home in Britain, which has risen 11.8 per cent in the last year according to Nationwide.

Despite seeming like a bargain, however, the village has not yet attracted a buyer with seven days left to bid.

It probably does not help that its condition is listed as 'used', the seller can only offer collection in person and refunds are not accepted.

Breathtaking: The village borders northern Italy's Gran Paradiso National Park (pictured)

But its optimistic item description - just a few sentences long - reads: 'At the foot of the Gran Paradiso National Park, it is located just 50 miles from the centre of Turin.

'A strategic location to live, start a business or a tourist restaurant. Fourteen homes combine more than 50 rooms.

'The village lends itself to a functional recovery, aimed at the renovation of buildings meeting architectural and historical criteria.'

The settlement has been described as one of the most beautiful in Italy, surrounded entirely by a lush green valley.

The national park which it borders was the first to be declared in Italy, and was used as a personal hunting ground by King Vittorio Emanuele II in the mid-1800s.

Its dramatic landscape with peaks more than 4,000m high is teeming with glaciers, vultures and mountain goats.

Aiding the sale is Italy's National Union of Mountain Communities (Uncem), which said any buyer would have to respect the traditional appearance of the beauty spot.

Italy's stagnant economy, however, means the sale could fall distinctly flat.

Last week the government admitted defeat over a public auction in which officials had tried to cut the nation's staggering debt by selling off national monuments.

Almost all the lots had to be withdrawn from sale after they did not attract enough interest, despite including a castle and a 'haunted' island in the Venetian lagoon.

Traditional: The 14 homes are made of stone and wood, and the buyer would have to respect their history

Well-placed: The item's short description on Ebay boasts that it is just 50 miles from Turin

In Britain, on the other hand, house prices are soaring after years of stagnation triggered by the 2008 crash.

Calsazio may be one of the most beautiful Italian villages ever put up for sale on Ebay, but it is not the first.

Two years ago the medieval Tuscan village of Pratariccia was offered for just 2.5million Euros after standing empty for 50 years.

The village was reportedly abandoned after its young population moved to the cities, including nearby Florence, and the dominance of a farming life vanished with the older generation.
