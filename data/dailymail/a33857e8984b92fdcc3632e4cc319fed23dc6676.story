With the festive season in full swing many of us will be fretting about our overindulgences and counting calories as we watch out waistlines expand.

After all, once the New Year arrives we'll all be signing up to the gym to get back into shape.

Coming to the rescue, one London cocktail bar has come up with a few concoctions perfect for seasonal damage control - so-called Salad Cocktails.

Many of us will be fretting about our overindulgences and counting calories

The boozy beverages from The Shrub & Shutter in Brixton encompass plenty of gin to keep you merry - with added vegetables.

Hangover-killing Vitamin C, fibre and minerals are all unlikely components to help you stay bright and bushy-tailed... At least, that's what we'll be hoping happens.

Savoury cocktails were the trend in London and The Shrub & Shutter say salad cocktails are the next trend.

Top bartender Dave Treganza used The Shrub & Shutter's house gin Whitley Neill to design the innovative drinks and they are available to order from January 1.

The  recipes are listed below so you can recreate them at home - happy mixing.
