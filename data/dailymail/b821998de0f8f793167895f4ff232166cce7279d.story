There's no question about it: 'Got Milk?' is out and 'Milk Life' is in.

Saying goodbye to one of the most recognizable and successful ad campaigns in history, the dairy industry have decided to wipe off the milk mustache after 20 years.

The campaign, which debuted in 1993 and has been all-but ever-present since, was designed to make milk look cool, but now marketeers want it to look crucial.

'The reason why we used celebrities at the time was to help improve milk’s image,' Sal Taibi, president of the agency involved in the 'Got Milk?' ads, told Fox 4 News.

'The idea was to convey the message that everybody drinks milk, even successful cool people.'

The new ads, which roll out Tuesday, have the tagline 'Milk Life' and feature regular people touting the protein richness of milk.

'We want to show how milk can help you power through everyday moments and everyday achievements,' said Taibi, whose agency also conceptualized the Milk Life ads.

The ads are commissioned by the Milk Processor Education Program (MilkPEP), which is spending $50 million on the marketing effort.

The new campaign comes on the back of figures that milk sales have dropped about 1 per cent for the past two years.

Research also shows consumers aren't aware of its nutritional benefits.

'Milk is a rich source of protein,' Julia Kadison, interim CEO for MilkPEP, said.

'All the ads will use special effects to show the energy you get from milk.

'It could be through wings, a parachute or even propellers.'

The 'Got Milk?' slogan was created by advertising agency Goodby Silverstein & Partners.

The first Got Milk? advert ran on October 29, 1993 and was directed by now-bigshot Hollywood heavy Michael Bay.

It featured a hapless history buff receiving a call to answer a radio station's $10,000 trivia question about who killed Alexander Hamilton.

The man, played by Sean Whalen, has turned his apartment into an obvious museum of the duel between Hamilton and Aaron Burr.

But because his mouth of full with a peanut butter sandwich and he has no milk to wash it down, his answer in unintelligible and he misses out.

As a result of the commercial, milk sales from 1994 to 1005 totalled 23.3 billion pounds.

The ad is still considered to be one of the all-time greatest commercials.

Over time celebrities became involved, with Naomi Campbell the first to be photographed with the milk mustache.

Elton John, Katie Couric, Bill Clinton and David Beckham and a roll call of other starts have also been featured.
