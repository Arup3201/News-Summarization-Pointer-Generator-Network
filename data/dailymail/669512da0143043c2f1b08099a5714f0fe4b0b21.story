Roy Hodgson has hit back at critics of Raheem Sterling and blamed the media for trying to create divisions between him and club managers.

Sterling was rested for England’s 1-0 win over Estonia last month after telling Hodgson that he was tired in a training session.

But Hodgson says that the Liverpool forward has been unfairly treated, and that there have never been any club vs country disputes while he has been England manager.

‘With young Raheem Sterling this week, it guts me to see that sort of treatment,' Hodgson told students at Cambridge University on Wednesday night. 'It’s totally unfair and totally wrong.

‘It’s suiting people’s agendas. But, you know, he’ll be stronger for it.

‘Is that right? Of course it’s not right! But I can’t turn the clock back, I’m living in 2014, I can’t go back to Downton Abbey!’

Hodgson was also adamant that he had not been involved in any arguments with Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers, and blamed the press for ‘trying to drive wedges’ between the managers.

‘There is no tension with Brendan,’ Hodgson told members of the Cambridge Union at the end of a talk about his philosophy of leadership. 'We get on very well.

‘I’ve been very fortunate that, in two-and-a-half years I’ve not had a single situation where a manager has tried to drag a player out of the team, or told me that they don’t want their players to take part.

'I think a lot of the players, if their manager said, “I don’t want you to play for England”, the player would say, “I’m sorry, I love playing for England and I want to go.”

‘Brendan and I have always got on very very well since he took the job at Liverpool, so there’s no problem at all.

‘And Jose Mourinho has come out and said that on my behalf as well.

“I’ve been lucky. I think there have been club vs country conflicts in the past, but I’ve been pretty shielded from it luckily.

‘Journalists would like more conflict, because they work in a slightly Machiavellian situation.

'So when there is just the simple situation – the simple situation of a player asking to be excused from a training session the day before a game because he was feeling tired.

‘I said, “No problem with that, in which case I won’t start you, but thanks for telling me”

‘They don’t want that, that’s too simple. It must be Brendan Rodgers.

‘Unfortunately, that’s how simple it is. He didn’t say he didn’t want to play the game – he played the game, 25 minutes.

‘Journalists are always going to try and drive wedges between managers.’

Hodgson also said he is ‘daring to dream’ of Euro 2016 success, but that realistically the tournament could be too soon for the current generation of England stars.

‘I’m hoping that what we’re doing today, and have been doing for the last couple of years really, will provide the cornerstones for this future generation.

‘I’m obviously hoping that in two years time, we’ll have got the experience, we’ll be in superb form and we’ll race through to become European champions.

‘But realistically it might take longer than that.

‘We’ve got plenty of players who can win games off their own back. I was at Liverpool against QPR, Raheem Sterling won the game off his own back in the last 10 minutes, because players couldn’t deal with him.

‘In the past we’ve been well organised, solid, hard to beat. But if you can be solid and hard to beat, and add the Sterlings, the Sturridges, the Welbecks, the Wilsheres, the Barkleys, you’ve got a chance. So we’re daring to dream.'

Hodgson later apologised for not including his captain Wayne Rooney in that list of game-changers, but said the Manchester United striker, who will be 30 by the time the tournament begins, was a crucial player for England, who Hodgson knows he can trust.

‘The one thing I’ll tell you about Rooney, he’s a very passionate person about playing for England,’ said Hodgson.

‘He’s a super professional, and the one thing I know I’ll get from Wayne, is that I can trust him.

‘If I say to him, “Wayne, this is your job today, I’d like you to fulfill this role”, he’ll do it. And that’s a great a quality for a player to give a coach.’
