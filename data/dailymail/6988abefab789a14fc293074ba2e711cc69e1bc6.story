Death row inmates in Oklahoma could be executed by having a bag put on their head which is then filled with poisonous gas.

Lethal injections will soon be phased out in the US state of Oklahoma after the necessary drugs have become difficult to obtain.

Senators have now approved plans for inmates facing the death penalty, which is legal in the state, to instead be executed using nitrogen hypoxia gas.

But Mike Christian, a Republican representative in the Oklahoma legislature, said the state could avoid paying for a gas chamber, which would cost around £200,000, by using a mask or a bag over an inmate’s head.

Whichever technique is used, the senate agreed that gassing prisoners with nitrogen hypoxia was less cruel.

Mr Christian said inmates would experience an effect like that felt by pilots whose oxygen supplies fail at high altitude, adding: ‘The people who have experienced it to the point of unconsciousness said it was a euphoric feeling. I’d say it’s more humane.’

Drugs such as sodium thiopental, used to sedate prisoners, have been difficult and expensive to get hold of since the EU introduced a ban on exporting substances intended for lethal injections in 2011. 

Until now the method of execution in Oklahoma has involved anaesthetising the inmate with sodium thiopental, before injecting them with muscle relaxant pancuronium bromide then potassium chloride, which stops the heart beating.

Attempts to substitute scarce drugs with other substances have seen botched executions take place in Oklahoma and other parts of the US. Last year Clayton Lockett, who was convicted of murder, rape, and kidnapping in 2000, was given an untested cocktail of drugs via injection including the sedative midazolam. He was left writhing in pain for 45 minutes and died of a heart attack.

Last month the execution of Charles Frederick Warner in Oklahoma lasted 18 minutes, during which he said: ‘My body is on fire.’

Warner, 47, was put to death for killing an infant in 1997. He was originally scheduled to be executed in April on the same night as Clayton Lockett, but state officials suspended executions in Oklahoma until an investigation was completed into what went wrong.

Warner was injected with rocuronium bromide and potassium chloride, which is said to cause suffocation and burning sensations, as well as a paralytic which prevented him from moving.
