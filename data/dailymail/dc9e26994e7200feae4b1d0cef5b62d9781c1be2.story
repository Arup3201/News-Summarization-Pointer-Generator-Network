Some pupils are naturally brighter than others, a study of twins suggests.

The research shows inherited intelligence accounts for almost two thirds of marks in GCSEs, while the amount of work done in class accounts for the rest.

This suggests raising the standard of teaching in schools may have a  limited impact on children’s academic achievement when compared with the genes they are born with. Or, put more simply, nature trumps nurture.

Kings College London research found inherited intelligence could account for nearly 60 per cent of a teenager's GCSE results, while quality of teaching only influences results by a third. The study was based upon long-term analysis of twins who sat the standard school exams at the age of 16

Professor Robert Plomin, who based the
 study on the exam results of thousands of children, said genetics had 
been overlooked because of concerns about ‘labelling’ children.

But he said his findings could spell 
the end of the generalised approach to schooling in favour of a system 
tailored to individual ability.

Genetic scanning could flag up 
children’s strengths and weaknesses early on in their school career, 
enabling teachers to identify how best to help them. ‘Kids label each 
other already. They know who’s sporty, who’s bright,’ he told The 
Spectator.

‘If we can read a kid’s genome we can 
predict and prevent disease. If we can read their DNA, we can tailor the
 teaching to help a kid with learning difficulties. Surely it’s worse to
 just sit in a classroom and sink, unable to read because no one has 
identified that you might have trouble.’

Professor Plomin, of the Institute of 
Psychiatry at King’s College London, runs the Twins Early Development 
Study, which follows all twins  born in England and Wales from 1994 to 
1996.

Analysis of the GCSE results of more 
than 11,100 of them suggested genetic background had a ‘substantial’ 
impact on their results. In science it accounted for 58 per cent of 
scores, in maths for 55 per cent and English 52 per cent.

IQ scores have been linked with genes 
before and Professor Plomin said the advantage increased with age. 
‘Little genetic differences become bigger and bigger as you go through 
life,’ he said. ‘Bright kids read more, they hang out with kids who read
 more.’

Professor Plomin thinks genetic scanning could eventually be used to identity particularly gifted children or those with academic weaknesses. By reading a child's genome (pictured), adults can predict and therefore influence a child's academic progression, as well as prevent disease

Prof Plomin believes education professionals have been too fast to dismiss the influence of genetics and intelligence on children's academic potential. But he thinks his research can be used in a positive way to develop education tailored to a child's unique needs, that will translate into better exam results

Professor Plomin, an American 
geneticist, has been asked to present his findings to ministers and 
officials at the Department for Education.

A DfE insider said: ‘As we learn more 
from science, a decentralised school system with great teachers 
providing personalised learning will be even more important.’

‘Twin tests’ usually involve 
comparisons between identical and non-identical twins – or those brought
 up apart in different environments.

n GIRLS who walk to school do better in class, according to research.

A study found that children who go by 
foot outperform peers who travel by bus or car. The difference is put 
down to exercise, with girls gaining more from the effort of walking.

Exercise has been shown to help the brain grow and boost memory.

The study of 1,700 Spanish teenagers was published in Archives of Paediatrics & Adolescent Medicine.
