In the next few weeks, almost half of the Barclays Premier League’s clubs will make the journey across the Atlantic, planting their flag into American soil and reaping the financial rewards of their money-spinning adventures.

It is, of course, consummate timing. The World Cup proved to be a moment in time for American soccer, an inflection point, when Jurgen Klinsmann’s endearing side received the blessing of the White House and attracted hundreds of thousands to stage public screenings.

As Manchester United, Manchester City, Liverpool, Arsenal, Tottenham, Aston Villa, Stoke City, Swansea City and Crystal Palace feel the buzz in the coming weeks, the marketing gurus will claim a moment of masterly foresight but surely few could have predicted World Cup would have such a transformative impact on the standing of soccer in the States this summer.

The signposts of potential have, however, been emerging in recent times. Viewing figures on NBC, the American channel broadcasting Premier League football last year, have struck a cord with club executives, with a record 31.5m Americans tuning in to watch the coverage last season, more than doubling the audience from the previous campaign. Research has illustrated that soccer is now the second most popular sport to watch among the kids of the USA.

Swansea, for example, were taken aback to discover that their 3-0 victory over Cardiff was the most watched game on American TV last season. Crystal Palace featured in two of the top ten matches, including their 3-1 victory over Sunderland, indicating that it is not only the big-hitters who are drawing attention.

The idea that a group of excitable American youngsters are ditching their baseball and basketball for a peek at Tony Pulis and Gary Monk is peculiar, to say the least, but on this evidence, it is little wonder that both Swansea and Palace have dipped their toes into American waters this summer.

For the leading clubs, the attraction is more straightforward.

The US market is evolving and they refuse to miss out. The US ownership of Manchester United, with the Glazer family and Liverpool, with the Fenway group, clearly has an influence but there is now no disguising the potential across the pond.

Even Arsene Wenger, for so long averse to these long-haul trips, has had to relent, with Arsenal making their first visit to the USA for 25 years. When they last visited, less than 10,000 turned out for a match in Miami. It will be a very different story when they line up against Thierry Henry and the New York Red Bulls on Saturday evening.

Manchester United’s executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward has long believed that the US market has been neglected and they, as a club, have begun to prioritise it as the number one region for growth.

Clearly, limitations remain. Manchester United’s evisceration of LA Galaxy, a team that won the MLS only a few years ago, suggests that the accelerated development of the US game may have left the football itself trailing in its wake.

Louis van Gaal has already revealed his anxieties, suggesting that such travelling is not conducive to preparation for a gruelling campaign in English football. This much is common sense and it is the way that many Premier League managers have always felt.

One, Jose Mourinho, has placed his foot on the brakes this year, convincing the hierarchy that a trip to Austria and matches in Holland, Slovenia and Hungary will suffice as his players recover from the strain and intensity of a World Cup in the energy-sapping heat of Brazil.

If Chelsea are leading the chasing pack by a canter come the turn of the year, we may see a number of Premier League managers knocking on the doors of their employers and asking to follow Mourinho’s example. Money, however, is the most powerful voice in football, as Van Gaal and co may discover.

For others, it is a game of catch-up. Manchester City are still emerging as a global force but the outlook is overwhelmingly positive.

It will be a sad day when football is judged by the spreadsheet but in the corridors of power, they are were encouraged by the latest financial report that showed the club’s YouTube channel received more than double the hits than Barcelona and Real Madrid last year and that almost half of the club’s website views came from abroad.

Now, they are spreading their wings. The New York City venture, with Frank Lampard and David Villa in tow, will attract capacity attendances and similar projects are underway in Australia and Japan.

The Asian market remains vital and we should remember that United, Arsenal, City and Liverpool all jetted to the Far East or South East Asia last summer. 

City, in particular, were left reeling by the state of the pitch and facilities when they played in a tournament with Sunderland and Tottenham.

On that day, Matija Nastasic picked up a serious-looking injury and in truth, the bog-bath resembled a flashback to Match of the Day in the 1970’s, with players were slipping and sliding through pools of standing water.

One of the attractions of the USA is the abundance of flawless recreational complexes, with leading universities, such as Harvard, offering accommodation and pristine training pitches.

This, for the sceptical managers, should offer some comfort but it will only be when management and boardrooms come together in January to organise next year’s tours when we fully discover where priorities lie.
