Belligerent: Vladimir Putin said the U.S. must back off from threatened air strikes before Russia would help make Syria hand 
over chemical weapons stockpiles

Vladimir Putin said last night Barack Obama must withdraw the threat of US air strikes against Syria before Russia would back plans to make Bashar Assad hand over Syria’s vast chemical weapons arsenal.

The Russian president delivered his ultimatum as the US, Britain and France prepared to table a UN Security Council resolution to force Syria to surrender an estimated 1,000 tonnes of poison gas.

The Western allies are also expected to insist that Assad faces trial for war crimes in the International Criminal Court.

President Putin’s intervention stepped up diplomatic pressure on Washington as a vote in Congress on missile strikes against Assad’s regime was postponed as a result of impromptu remarks by US Secretary of State John Kerry.

Mr Kerry suggested air strikes could be avoided if Syria agreed to put its weapon stocks under ‘international control’. Diplomatic sources said Mr Kerry had blundered in making the suggestion on a visit to London.

Although there had been some discussion of how to make safe Syria’s chemical weapons – the biggest stockpile in the world – Western leaders had envisaged such steps being taken after US-led military strikes.

But as Russia – belligerent ally of Assad – seized on Mr Kerry’s remarks, the Syrian government quickly said it accepted its proposal on surrendering chemical weapons.

Foreign minister Walid al-Moualem said Syria would declare its chemical weapons arsenal and sign the international chemical weapons convention.

And the Russian president insisted the US renounce the option of taking military action in Syria to allow checks on Damascus’s chemical arsenal to go ahead. ‘It all makes sense and can work if the US side and all those who  support it renounce the use of force,’ Mr Putin said.

Iran also said it was backing the plan. ‘We are offering President Obama a way out,’ its government said.

support for his administration's plans to launch punitive military 
attacks on Syria

The US, UK and other allies say there is conclusive evidence that Syrian government forces carried out a sarin attack in Damascus on August 21, killing 1,429 people.

But the West’s response has been thrown into turmoil by the British Parliament’s refusal to back military action, followed by President Obama’s decision to delay and hold a vote in Congress.

After speaking by phone with the US President yesterday, David Cameron warned that the plan must not be a ‘distraction’ from ensuring that action is taking in response to the use of nerve gas against civilians.

The Prime Minister told MPs the Russian plan was ‘an interesting proposal’, adding: ‘If it is a serious one, then it is one we should take very seriously, because it could achieve a major goal we have as a Government – to get rid of chemical weapons.

‘It is important to make sure that this isn’t some delaying tactic, that this isn’t some ruse. In the resolution, I think it’s quite important that we have some clarity about thresholds.

'We need to know that there’s a proper timetable for doing this, we need to know that there would be a proper process for doing it, and crucially there would have to be consequences if it wasn’t done.’

Mr Cameron said Syria’s chemical arsenal was the biggest in the world and the plan should mean that it is not only handed over to an international agency, but also destroyed. Mr Cameron added: ‘If this is a serious proposal, we should treat it accordingly. Of course we should be sceptical, of course we should not forget a war crime has been committed.

‘This could be a major step forward, but we need to test it out properly. I think we should also be clear that none of this would be happening if there wasn’t serious international pressure, led by the United States, on Syria over the issue of chemical weapons.’

Mr Cameron said the UN resolution would contain thresholds for Syrian action and a clear timetable.

He added: ‘Standing back from this and looking at the overall picture, if we can achieve the removal and the destruction of the biggest chemical weapons arsenal in the world, that would be a significant step forward.’

President Obama said the proposal was ‘potentially a significant breakthrough’, but he remained sceptical that Syria would carry it out.

The Syrian foreign minister said the move would ‘remove grounds for US aggression’.
