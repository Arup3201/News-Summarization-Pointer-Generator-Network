She has described her comeback single as a satirical swipe at sexism in pop music.

But Lily Allen yesterday found herself accused of being a racist after using scantily clad black women in the music video for the track.

The single, Hard Out Here, will be released on Sunday but the video was put out this week and within hours led hundreds of fans to question the singer’s decision to use the troupe of dancers.

Controversial: Lily Allen in the video for new single Hard Out Here which has seen her accused of being a racist

Satirical? The video sees Miss Allen, 28, fully clothed, singing about how she does not need to exploit herself in order to be a successful musician

The video sees Miss Allen, 28, fully clothed, singing about how she does not need to exploit herself in order to be a successful musician.

She has said that this is her response to recent music videos, such as those by Miley Cyrus, which can be seen to portray women as sexual objects.

As Miss Allen sings, the troupe of dancers perform. The majority are black and they are seen twerking, a lewd and particularly provocative hip thrusting dance.

Controversially, the black women are barely covered but the two white women in the video are wearing gold jackets over their skimpy outfits to protect their modesty.

One fan wrote on Twitter: ‘Lily Allen is actually disgusting. White female pop stars can’t make a point about sexism without putting down black people, can they?’

Another said: ‘Oh, god, Lilly Allen, gross. That is racist and disgusting. You don’t get to “satirize” from place of privilege!’

Debate: Yesterday a discussion on Woman¿s Hour on Radio 4 appeared to echo the distress of fans, as race and feminist campaigners voiced their concern about the video¿s content

Yesterday a discussion on Woman’s Hour
 on Radio 4 appeared to echo the distress of fans, as race and feminist 
campaigners voiced their concern about the video’s content.

They argued that Miss Allen presents her black backing dancers as ‘nothing more than jiggling’ material.

Reni
 Eddo-Lodge, a blogger and black feminist, told programme host Dame 
Jenni Murray she felt ‘troubled’ by the racial message of the video and 
criticised the ‘denigrating images of black people’ that contribute 
towards ‘structural racism’.

She added: ‘I first cut my teeth when I was getting involved in feminism with this issue.

'I
 was a teenager who absolutely loved this music but felt conflicted that
 my favourite artists deemed me as a person with a black bum, a woman 
with a black bum, as nothing more than jiggling material.

‘[Twerking] was a black thing. That was an issue of black patriarchy, don’t get me wrong.

One fan wrote on Twitter: ¿Lily Allen is actually disgusting. White female pop stars can¿t make a point about sexism without putting down black people, can they?¿

'But now that it’s become 
mainstreamed it’s about black women’s bodies served up for a very white 
male gaze and it’s about mockery. And I just can’t see how these two 
things can marry harmoniously.’

In
 an online defence of her video, Miss Allen said she was attempting to 
parody such singers, and added that she would be ‘deeply saddened if 
anyone came away from that video feeling taken advantage of or 
compromised in any way’.

Commenting
 on sexism in pop in an interview earlier this week, she said: ‘I think 
objectification of women is fine if I feel there is a sense of ownership
 from the woman.

'If it comes from somewhere else and it feels like the woman is being coerced or forced into something, then it’s gross.’

Last
 night, however, a media campaigner said that while Miss Allen meant 
well, she had perhaps given the wrong message with her video.

Vivienne
 Pattison, of pressure group Mediawatch-UK, said: ‘I’m sure she didn’t 
mean to be racist and she probably intended the women dancing behind her
 to act as a message that she doesn’t need to behave like that. And I 
applaud her efforts.

'But unfortunately singers really can’t afford to be complacent and they must recognise what a serious issue this is.’

It
 is not the first time an artist has got into trouble for using 
‘twerking’ dancers in their music videos. Robin Thicke faced a backlash 
over the scantily clad hip-trusting women that feature in his Blurred 
Lines video earlier this year.

And
 former Disney child star Miss Cyrus, 20, prompted outrage when she 
performed with Thicke at an awards ceremony in August, doing similar 
moves while dressed in a nude-coloured leotard and making lewd gestures 
with an oversized foam finger.
