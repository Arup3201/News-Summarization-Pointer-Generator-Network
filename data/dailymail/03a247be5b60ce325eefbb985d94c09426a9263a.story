Manchester City are watching Sampdoria's Italy international midfielder Roberto Soriano.

The 24-year-old was born in Germany to Italian parents and initially came through the ranks at Bayern Munich.

City are looking for versatile attacking midfielders and are keen on Wolfsburg star Kevin de Bruyne. The Bundesliga side want a staggering £40million for the Belgian who they bought from Chelsea for £16.7m and Bayern Munich and Paris St Germain are also in the hunt.

Soriano was called up to the national squad last year and can play centrally or on the left hand side. Inter Milan and Schalke have also posted scouts to watch him lately.

City had scouts watching Manchester United target Holland international winger Memphis Depay of PSV Eindhoven last week and his highly-rated teammate Jetro Willems, a 20-year-old left-back.
