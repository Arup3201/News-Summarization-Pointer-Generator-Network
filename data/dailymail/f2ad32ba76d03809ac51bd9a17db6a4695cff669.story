Skoda has clinched a ‘superb’ double victory with two of its cars topping the league-table of the most satisfying to drive in Britain.

The top-of the range Skoda Superb from the Czech manufacturer - once the butt of cruel jokes - took top honours with the Skoda Yeti sports utility vehicle in second place.

They were ahead of the British-built Jaguar XF saloon in the respected What Car? 2013 UK Vehicle Ownership Satisfaction Study.

The Skoda Superb came first in the poll with an 83 per cent satisfaction rating

The more adventurous Skoda Yeti came a close second, cementing the manufacturers success

But Jaguar as a whole leapt ahead of the opposition by clinching the top ranking when it came to car manufacturers, beating Japan’s Lexus and Honda - with Skoda in fourth place ahead of Germany’s Mercedes-Benz.

The Skoda Superb Saloon had a satisfaction rating of 83 per cent, while their Yeti sports utility vehicle had 82.2 per cent.

the Jaguar XF saloon came a close third with 82.8 per cent.

The company laughed off decades of jokes as it celebrated its double win.

The
car firm said jokes about them had long been consigned ‘to the dustbin 
of history’ leaving its satisfied customers smiling, and their downcast 
rivals laughing on the other side of their faces.

The company even managed to beat luxury manufacturer jaguar who came a close third with their XF

And Jaguar’s off-road sibling Land 
Rover won the accolade of the most improved car-maker, bounding into the
top ten for the first time in the What Car? poll carried out with car 
quality experts J.D. Power and Associates.

By contrast, bottom of the satisfaction ratings were Chevrolet, part of US giant General Motors, Alfa Romeo and Mitsubishi.

The Chevrolet managed a satisfaction rating of 70.2 per cent, while the Alfa Romeo Mito reached 70.7 per cent.

The findings are based on a wide-range of detailed satisfaction ratings - from comfort and performance to quality and running costs - from more than 16,000 UK motorists covering 16 cars and 27 manufacturers.

The What Car?/JD Power satisfaction 
study is based on the evaluations of more than 16,000 motorists 
interviewed online after an average of up to three years of ownership. 
The study was fielded in December 2012 and January 2013.

It measures customer satisfaction 
with the vehicle and dealer service and is based on evaluation of 66 
separate items grouped and scored against four key measures : vehicle 
appeal including performance, design, comfort and features (31%); 
vehicle quality and reliability (22%); ownership costs including fuel 
consumption, insurance and costs of service/repair (25%); and dealer 
service satisfaction (22%).

What Car? editor-in-chief Chas Hallett said: ‘Skoda’s knock-out performance comes on the back of a 20% sales increase in 2012. Not only does the Superb score a stonking victory after a three-place climb up the chart, the Yeti takes second place.

The Chevrolet Spark failed to deliver as voters left it last in the poll with only a 70.2 per cent satisfaction rating

'Winning attributes included practicality that didn’t compromise driving appeal and prices made more affordable by Skoda’s no VAT and 0% finance offers.’

On Jaguar’s success Mr Hallett said: ‘This is another great achievement for everyone at Jaguar. For the second year in a row, Jaguar has claimed the top spot. This study shows that customers are really satisfied with their Jaguars.

Q: Why do Skodas have a heated rear windscreen? A: To keep your hands warm when you’re pushing them.

Q. What do you call a Skoda with twin exhausts? A. A wheelbarrow.

Q: What do you call a Skoda with a sun roof? A: A skip.

Q: How do you make a Skoda go at 60mph? A: Drive it off Beachy Head.

Q: How do you make a Skoda disappear? A: Apply rust remover.

A man goes into a shop and says: ‘Can I have a new petrol cap for my Skoda?’ The salesman replies: ‘That sounds a fair swop.’

'Owners said they didn’t regret spending a single penny on [the Jaguar XF], rating it excellent across all categories.

'Jaguar dealers were reported to be ‘as slick as the cars with helpful staff taking the time to explain things, and going out of their way to accommodate owners’ schedules’.

Mr Hallett added:’Land Rover is the star performer in the 2013 survey, moving up six places to take sixth place, the first time it has appeared in the top 10.’

On bottom of the pile Chevrolet and its new Spark, the What Car? report notes: ‘It’s a miserable first survey showing for the Spark, entering the running at rock bottom.

'Owners rated it below par in every area; body panel gaps, unyielding fuel caps, tyre wear and even some horn problems led them to question the car’s quality, and they struggled to find anything positive to say about it at all.

'Engine stalling, noisy brakes, seat rattles and wind noise were also reported. At least Chevrolet dealers were friendly, even if they did charge too much.’

Founded in 1895
to make push-bikes, with the Skoda name used for the first time from 
1925, the firm had its proud pre-war heyday in the 1930s. It only became
a joke after the end of the second world war when the firm and the 
country fell under the rule of the Communist Soviet Union.

Skoda 
has been owned and revamped since 1991 as a smart value choice for 
motorists by German car-giant Volkswagen following the end of the Cold 
War and the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe from 1989
