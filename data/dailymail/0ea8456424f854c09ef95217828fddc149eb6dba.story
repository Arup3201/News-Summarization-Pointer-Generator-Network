Dimitar Berbatov insisted Monaco 'wanted to win more' than Arsenal after the Ligue 1 side recorded a famous victory at the Emirates in the Champions League last-16 first leg on Wednesday night.

The former Tottenham striker netted Monaco's second on his return to north London in a 3-1 victory to take a precious and surprise lead into the second leg in three weeks time.

Geoffrey Kondogbia opened the scoring for the visitors in the first half before Berbatov doubled their advantage 10 minutes after the interval.

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain halved the deficit in the first minute of injury time to give Arsene Wenger's side hope in the tie but Yannick Ferreira Carrasco rounded off a superb counter attack in the closing seconds.

Asked why Monaco beat their opponents Berbatov replied: ‘Because we are a good team and we wanted to win more than them - fighting all over the pitch, winning all over our challenges, and we got more goals.

‘It’s a result nobody expected but we are confident in our abilities. It was a deserved win, a great win, but it’s not over as we have another game and Arsenal have the players to turn it around.

‘Arsenal have great players and are very dangerous so it’s not over yet. We have one more game in Monaco and anything can happen but we go into it with a comfortable lead.’

Afterwards, Prince Albert of Monaco, having celebrated the win on the pitch at full-time, said: 'I found them very slow at moving the ball around and was expecting more of them.'
