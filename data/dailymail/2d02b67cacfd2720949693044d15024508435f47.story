Six months after the disappearance of Timmothy Pitzen, police are hoping that a detailed analysis of his mother’s SUV will help lead them to the boy.

Police released some results on Friday of a forensic analysis of the grass, dirt and debris that had accumulated on Amy Fry-Pitzen’s 2004 Ford Expedition.

They are also hoping that surveillance videos and details about where Amy may have travelled that were released Friday will help jog a memory.

Enduring mystery: Illinois schoolboy Timmothy Pitzen disappeared when his mother killed herself in a roadside motel room

On May 11, Amy took her only son out 
of school and, without telling any family members, she and Timmothy went
on a three-day, 500-mile road trip, stopping at zoos and water parks in
northern Illinois and Wisconsin.

On the third day, Amy finally called 
family to report she was fine. The next morning, police found her body 
in a Rockford motel.

Police announced on Friday that the 
lab has determined that plant material on the SUV indicate it was 
stopped for a time on a wide gravel shoulder or a gravel road.

Near the gravel area where the vehicle stopped, the SUV was backed into a grassy field, the beaconnews.suntimes.com reports.

The lab results have given police a clearer indication of where Timmothy may have been dropped off.

A few weeks ago, six months after the Illinois schoolboy disappeared when his mother killed herself in a roadside motel room, his grandmother Alana Anderson and father Jim Pitzen marked what would have been his seventh birthday by planting a 7-year-old blue spruce tree in the back garden.

Anderson told the Chicago Tribune: 'I bought him a birthday card and cut out pictures of the things I would have bought for him,' 'A lighted skateboard. A remote-control helicopter.'

The lively schoolboy vanished on May 11, when Fry-Pitzen, picked him up from his Aurora elementary school.

In what were to be her final days mother 
and son went to the zoo and a water park, one in the far north east Illinois,
the other in Wisconsin, before travelling west back into Illinois.

Fry Pitzen eventually checked into a motel near Rockford, northern Illinois alone and slit her wrists, leaving a suicide note and several letters in the post.

In the notes to her husband, her mother and a close friend, she said her son was safe, and with people who loved him, but she did not say who she had left him with.

According to Anderson, one of the notes warns, 'You will never find Timmothy'.

And despite a massive search operation investigators have not been able to track down the missing child.

Clue? One of the new surveillance clips show Timmothy and his mother walking to an elevator at the Key Lime Cove resort in Gurnee around 3:15 pm May 11, shortly after they checked in

Three
months ago police revealed that they found ‘a concerning amount’  of 
the child’s blood in the backseat of his mother’s 2004 Ford Expedition 
SUV.

The clothes Fry-Pitzen was wearing when captured on surveillance video have never been found.

This
includes the clothing she was wearing when she and her son checked out 
of the Wisconsin Dells resorts, hours before she checked in alone to the
hotel room where her body was found.

But the family continues to believe that Timmothy is alive.

The blood may have come from a nose bleed Timmothy had about a year ago, they say.

New lead? Fry Pitzen is shown here entering and leaving Sullivan Foods in Winnebago, Illinois around 8 pm May 13, not long before she killed herself.

And testing of the knife Fry Pitzen used to kill herself revealed no traces of her son's DNA.

'I just try to do one day at a time,' Jim Pitzen told the Chicago Tribune. 'I hope whoever has Tim understands that he's not theirs and he needs to come home to his family.'

The family’s steadfast belief that Timothy is alive is based on two things. Fry-Pitzen cared for her son deeply and showed her affection often.

The 43-year-old had periodically 
battled depression, but, her mother insisted, 'was not a crazy 
person. She absolutely never acted bizarrely.'

And she methodically planned her 
suicide, leading Anderson and Pitzen to conclude that she'd made 
similarly comprehensive plans for her son's upbringing.

The
mother-of-one had helped Anderson, a retired emergency room nurse, 
paint her house and clear up her backyard in recent months, asking, 'Is 
there anything else I need to do for you?'

She had also given her mother some antique furniture of hers that Anderson had long coveted.

Toll
records reveal she made unexplained trips, in February and March, to 
the area where the pair were last known to have been travelling, and to 
which she had no prior connection.

With
the holidays approaching, Anderson, who lives on her own, says she 
misses her grandson, who would sleep at her home every other weekend.

For now she is just 'trying to put the pieces of my life together. They're just not that many of them left anymore.'

'It's
been rough,' Anderson told the Tribune. 'I think the first couple of months you're 
in such shock, you're almost numb and it doesn't quite sink in. But now …
I don't expect it to be a whole lot better anytime soon.'

She started a journal about a week after Timmothy vanished, in which she writes 'cute, little stories about him so he'll know what he 
was like, how I felt about him; how hard we looked for him; the places 
we went and things we did together.'

Jim Pitzen has lost his job in 
manufacturing since his son’s disappearance, but tries to keep occupied 
to distract himself from his loss, and his questions.

Suicide: The boy's mother, Amy Fry-Pitzen, 43, killed herself

He is still angry with his wife, the Tribune reported.

He said: 'I think about her all the time.'

'I just wonder what she did with our son and why she wanted 
him to be with someone else.'

Police are expected to release new video of Timmothy today, hoping that new leads may emerge.

Forensic investigators have been working to try to identify tall grass or weeds found on the underside of the SUV to link the materials to a more specific area.

After Timothy's disappearance 
officers searched a remote area about 100 miles west of Chicago, where 
cellphone records indicated Fry-Pitzen and Timmothy were last together.

Meanwhile, mindful of time passing, the
loving grandmother has started to throw away some of her grandson's 
things, disposing of clothes that no longer would fit, and toys that he had 
outgrown.

To remind her of Timmothy, she is holding on to his favorites: some cars and truck, a much-loved book, 
'Diary of a Worm,' and even a plastic spoon he used the 
last time they visited Dairy Queen.

She said: 'He's out there. And I think when he's old enough, he'll find us.'
