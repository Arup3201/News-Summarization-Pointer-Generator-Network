Lewis Hamilton has welcomed the idea of London hosting a Grand Prix in the future.

The recently-crowned world champion said it would be 'insane' for himself and compatriot Jenson Button to compete at a Grand Prix in England's capital city.

Formula One's British Grand Prix is currently held at Silverstone in Northamptonshire - but Hamilton is keen to race in London.

Hamilton, who won his second World Championship at the weekend, visited MediaCityUK on Tuesday 

Speaking to ITV News London, Hamilton said: 'I’m proud to be British and I’m proud to represent the country. There’s only really me and Jenson doing it.

'When you win the Championship and you have the chance to get the flag, it’s one of the proudest moments. Having the British Grand Prix is really important because sport is huge here.

'A London Grand Prix would be insane. We have the Singapore Grand Prix in the streets of Singapore and it's unbelievable at night time there.

'It would be even better here. It would bring more tourists in, not that we need any more because it's always such a popular place.'

Hamilton arrived in London on Monday after landing at Heathrow Airport alongside girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger.

The 29-year-old flew over from Abu Dhabi a day after winning the prestigious World Championship.
