Tottenham have been fined 15,000 euros (£11,870) by UEFA over the three pitch invasions during the Europa League match against Partizan Belgrade.

The match at White Hart Lane on November 27 was suspended four minutes before half-time following three separate pitch invasions, which appeared to be orchestrated.

UEFA's control, ethics and disciplinary body (CEDB) dealt with the case and on Thursday announced the fine against Spurs, who won the match 1-0.

The three pitch invaders wore T-shirts bearing the name of a headphone manufacturer associated with Spurs and six other Premier League teams.

Three men were charged by police over the pitch invasions, the last of which caused the match to be delayed for around 10 minutes just before half-time.

Nathaniel Thompson, 23, Helder Gomes, 22, and Daniel Jarvis, 26, were arrested after encroaching onto the pitch in what appeared at the time to be an orchestrated PR stunt by a headphone manufacturer which produces licensed Spurs merchandise.

Two of them appeared to attempt to take 'selfie' photographs on handheld devices.

Spurs striker Roberto Soldado looked to strip one of the invaders of his T-shirt, which like those worn by the other two intruders bore the name of headphone manufacturer BassBuds.

The company issued a statement via Facebook condemning the actions, saying it was 'appalled' that the match was interrupted in such a manner and claimed an online hidden camera prank show they were working with had gone rogue.

Neither Soldado or Moussa Dembele faced action from UEFA for their attempts to stop the pitch invaders.
