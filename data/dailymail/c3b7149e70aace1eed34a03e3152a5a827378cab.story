He is already the longest serving heir apparent in British history. 

So if Prince Charles ever gets too bored of waiting to accede to the throne, then he might just be tempted to have himself crowned King Carol 111 instead.

Central European newspapers yesterday were alight with speculation that the Prince of Wales could be anointed the next King of Romania if the country’s monarchy is restored.

The last royal ruler, King Michael – who
 reigned from 1927 to 1930, and again from 1940 to 1947 - was forced to 
abdicate by the country’s new Communist leaders, who threatened to carry
 out mass executions if he refused to step down.

Romania
 went on to endure decades of communist government, most notably under 
dictatorial party leader Nicolae Ceausescu who ruled the country with an
 iron fist from 1965 until he was deposed and executed in 1989.

Admittedly, it is unlikely that he 
will ever be a serious contender for the throne as the deposed King, 
Prince Michael, is still alive – albeit rather elderly at 90 – and has 
family of his own.

Despite the reintroduction of democracy, in recent years there have been increasing calls for the monarchy to be restored.

And after he revealed in an interview just a few weeks ago that he is related to historical Romanian ruler Vlad the Impaler – the bloodthirsty nobleman who inspired Dracula – Charles’s name has now, bizarrely, been thrown into the ring.

But 
local newspapers have taken great pains to point out that as well as his
 ‘stake’ in the throne through his ancestor Vlad, Prince Charles’s 
mother, Queen Elizabeth II, is also third cousin to the deposed King 
whose great-great-grandmother was Queen Victoria.

The
 rumour mill went into further overdrive when the country’s powerful 
tourism and development minister, Elena Udrea, flew to London last week 
to meet with Charles at Clarence House.

The meeting was not publicised in 
advance, although pictures were subsequently released, and the glamorous
 Udrea subsequently spoke of her host in glowing terms and said 
Romanians should be more like Charles and ‘appreciate the country they 
live in’.

Newspapers have 
even gone so far as to speculate that Charles could give up the British 
throne in favour of his popular eldest son and heir, Prince William, to 
become the next King of Romania instead.

They
 say the suggestion has such currency it is the reason its rattled 
president, Traian Băsescu, has launched a series of attacks on the 
former King Michael and the monarchy in general.

Iron fist: Romania endured decades of communist government, most notably under Nicolae Ceausescu who ruled from 1965 until he was deposed and executed in 1989

Intriguingly Charles is incredibly passionate about Romania. Indeed, he loves
 the area around the Carpathian Mountains in Transylvania so much that 
he has bought a holiday home in the region and recently said in an 
interview: ‘The genealogy shows I am descended from Vlad the Impaler, so
 I do have a bit of a stake in the country.’

Charles secretly bought the simple, 
white-washed property in the heritage site of Viscri in 2005 with the 
help of the Mihai Eminescu Trust, a British-based charity which works to
 preserve Romania's historic Saxon villages from destruction, of which 
he is patron.

He paid £18,000 for the three-bedroomed, 18th Century farmhouse.

Viscri lies in a picturesque valley in the heart of Transylvania, north-west of Brasov, and is comprised of men and women of mainly of Romanian and gypsy origin. 

It has already won many of  Europe's highest awards for cultural restoration and economic regeneration.

Charles has visited the village 
several times and is so taken with the simplicity of local life that he 
holidays there each summer.

He
 and his security team sleep in the traditional white-washed village 
house - complete with wooden truckle beds and outside toilets - and 
drink locally-pressed organic apple juice.

The house is rented out to overseas tourists when the prince is not in residence.

Clarence House last night confirmed the 
prince had a meeting with the Romanian minister but declined to be drawn
 on the nature of their conversations.

A spokesman did, however, say the 
prince was very fond of the country and pointed out that he already 
owned properties in the region.

But senior royal sources have dismissed the speculation as ‘ridiculous’.
