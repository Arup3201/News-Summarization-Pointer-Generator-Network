Poker player Phil Ivery say he has been left with 'no alternative' but to take legal action against Mayfair gambling club Crockfords

An American professional gambler known as 'the Tiger Woods of Poker' is suing one of Britain's oldest gambling clubs claiming it is withholding almost £8million in 'winnings'.

Phil Ivey, 36, has filed in a writ in London's High Court claiming he is owed £7.8million by Crockfords casino in Mayfair.

In a statement issued through his lawyers, he said he had 'no alternative' but to pursue legal action after winning the money playing Punto Banco, a card game similar to baccarat, in August last year.

He said: 'I am deeply saddened that 
Crockfords has left me no alternative but to proceed with legal action, 
following its decision to withhold my winnings.

'I have much respect for 
Gentings, which has made this a very difficult decision for me.

'Over the years I have won and lost 
substantial sums at Crockfords and I have always honoured my 
commitments.

'At the time, I was given a receipt for my winnings but 
Crockfords subsequently withheld payment. I, therefore, feel I have no 
alternative but to take legal action.'

Mr Ivey’s lawyer, Matthew Dowd of 
Archerfield Partners, added: 'It is with great regret that Phil has been 
forced to issue court proceedings against Crockfords to secure payment 
of his winnings. The matter is now in the hands of the Court.'

Crockfords, part of the Genting Group, has not yet answered the claim in court.

A spokesman for Genting said the company did not comment on matters involving individual members but added: 'In this rare instance we are able to confirm that our position, which is supported by strong legal advice, has been made very clear to Mr Ivey’s solicitors from the start. We shall be filing our defence shortly and defending this claim vigorously.'

Crockfords casino traces its origins to the private members gaming club established in 1828 by William Crockford.

'It was his original vision to create a club of splendour and elegance fit for royalty, diplomats and the aristocratic elite,' a statement on the club's website reads.

Mr Ivey is one of the world’s most successful poker players and has won numerous World Series of Poker Championship bracelets.
