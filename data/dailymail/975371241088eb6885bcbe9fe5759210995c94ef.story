Anyone born after the year 2000 should be banned from ever buying cigarettes, leading doctors Ssid today.

The idea is to stop young people from ever starting to smoke - and the move could create the first 'smoke free generation', medics said.

Those at the British Medical Association's annual representative meeting voted 'overwhelmingly' in favour for a campaign to 'enforce the move.

The proposed move would 'ban forever the sale of cigarettes to any individual born after the year 2000'. Eighty per cent of smokers start as teenagers as a result of intense peer pressure

This would 'ban forever the sale of 
cigarettes to any individual born after the year 2000', they said. 

Presenting the motion Dr Tim Crocker-Buque said: 'The level of harm caused by smoking is unconscionable.

'Smoking is a choice made by adolescents that results in an adulthood of addiction and an early death.

'By banning the sale of cigarettes to people born after 2000, we begin to create the first tobacco free generation.'

He added: 'Smoking is not a rational, informed choice of adulthood, Eighty per cent of smokers start as teenagers as a result of intense peer pressure.

'This proposal would gradually phase out the sale of cigarettes to the next generation, with no impact on current smokers.

'As this generation reach 18 in 2018 they would be prevented from buying cigarettes for their lifetime in a move that would progressively phase out cigarette sales.

'It is not expected that this policy 
will instantly prevent people from smoking. Instead it aims to 
progressively de-normalise cigarette smoking.'

Speaking against the motion, Dr Yohanna Takwoingi said the idea was 'idiotic' adding: 'There is nothing as attractive to a young person as the command "don't".'

Dr Iain Kennedy, from the BMA's junior doctors conference, added: 'Figures show that 19 per cent of smokers are managerial or professional versus 33 per cent in manual classes.

'I am not convinced that we as a trade union should be supporting policy which demonises and criminalises the activity of working people.' He added the prospect would be 'unworkable'.Pro-smoking group Forest also spoke out against the motion.

'Prohibition doesn't work,' said the group's director Simon Clark. 'It will create a huge black market in cigarettes and drive generations of adult smokers into the hands of illicit traders.

'Criminalising adults for buying tobacco is illiberal and impractical.'

Another motion was tabled calling on the BMA to to promote the legalisation of cannabis - but this was voted against.

Geoffrey Lewis, a retired consultant from Leicester, said: 'Cannabis use should be treated primarily as a health issue, not a criminal justice issue.

'Too often the focus on drug use and addiction is from a 
criminal justice rather than a public health point of view.

'Doctors 
see first hand the damaging effects of a system which seeks to 
criminalise drug users rather than a treat their addiction.'

He added that existing
 drug policy is 'contradictory and ineffective'. T

The number of drug users 
has soared in then lat 30 years, despite the introduction of 
tougher drug laws.

Dr Lewis added: 'Our policy makers aren't prepared to have
 a sensible, rational, evidence-based debate on drugs.

'That's not to
 say that cannabis use isn't dangerous. It is. But the current law isn't
 working and only by adopting a different approach can we regulate, 
educate and exert a level of quality control.'
