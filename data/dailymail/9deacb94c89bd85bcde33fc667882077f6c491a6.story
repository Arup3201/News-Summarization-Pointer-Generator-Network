Four new possible suspects in the brutal killings of three boy scouts in Arkansas in 1993 have been named by attorneys in the case - and the stepfather of one of the boys is among them.

Terry Hobbs, the stepfather of eight-year-old victim Stevie Branch, has been named in documents released in Marian, Arkansas by the attorneys for Pam Hobbs, Stevie's mother.

The new documents claim that Hobbs and three other men killed Stevie and two of his friends after they caught the boys spying on them while they were taking drugs.

The bodies of Stevie, Michael Moore and Christopher Byers, all eight years old, were found naked, tied with their shoelaces and mutilated in a ditch in West Memphis, Arkansas in May 1993.

Three local teenagers who became known as the 'West Memphis Three', Damien Echols, Jessie Misskelley Jr. and 
Jason Baldwin, were convicted of the murders and sentenced to death but staunchly maintained their innocence.

After the case garnered national and celebrity attention, the three were freed in 2011 after agreeing 
to an Alford plea, allowing them to maintain their innocence while 
pleading guilty.

Pam Hobbs has said she does not believe the three men who were originally convicted for the crimes were guilty of murdering her son and his friends.

On Wednesday, a hearing was held to allow her and the other parents of the victims to see the evidence of the case; during this hearing, attorneys filed a motion to name four further suspects.

On the list were Terry Hobbs and his friend David Jacoby as well as two men who would have been teenagers at the time: LG Hollingsworth and Buddy Lucas, WREG reported.

Their names have emerged after a witness stepped forward to claim that Buddy Lucas told him he had been part of the murders, years after they had taken place.

The witness said he learned that Hobbs and Jacoby invited the two teenagers to meet with them to buy drugs. When the men were smoking pot, they saw the three boys spying on them, he said.

Jacoby grabbed one of the boys and 
beat him while Hobbs ordered Lucas and Hollingsworth to grab 
and hold the other two boys, according to the affidavit.

Hobbs then killed the boys with a pocket knife and mutilated their bodies, according to the papers.

The witness said he contacted the West Memphis police to tell them what he had learned but no one ever returned his call. Lucas has been described as mentally 'slow', WREG reported.

A new documentary about the murders, West of Memphis, also homed in on Terry Hobbs, claiming that his DNA was found on rope used to tie the boys' feet.

His ex-wife's family also said that 
Hobbs had a fraught, almost jealous relationship with Stevie, who was 
fearful of his stepfather.

Wrongfully convicted: Jason Baldwin was one of the three accused members of the West Memphis Three, who were released from prison last year

Redemption: Jessie Misskelley was one of the three who went to prison for a grisly crime that they swore they didn't commit

Quest for justice: Damien Echols and his two co-defendants, insisted for years that they were not involved in the murder of the three boys

Freed: The three, who have always maintained their innocence, were freed last year after an Alford plea

Attorneys also said Hobbs' nephew, Michael 
Hobbs Jr, told friends his uncle murdered the three boys, but the elder Hobbs has denied any involvement with the murders.

'I am content in my heart that Damien 
Echols, Jason Baldwin and Jessie Misskelley did not murder my son,' 
Stevie’s mother Pam Hobbs said as she pleaded for investigators to look 
at new evidence.

The three became the subjects of a series of documentaries called Paradise Lost which captured the attention of celebrities including Johnny Depp, who paid legal fees to free them, and Pearl Jam frontman Eddie Vedder.
