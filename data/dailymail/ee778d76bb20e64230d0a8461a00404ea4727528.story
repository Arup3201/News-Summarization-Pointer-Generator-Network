An American couple have disappeared in Peru in an area where a criminal gang were believed to have been plotting to kidnap tourists, authorities said today.

Jamie Neal, 27, and her boyfriend 25-year-old Garrett Hand, have been missing since January during a biking vacation in Peru.

The U.S. State Department today issued a poster of the couple from San Francisco - who were last seen getting on a bus in the town of Cusco, headed for Lima on January 26 before getting in a cab.

In love: The couple posted many pictures of their trip on Facebook to being with but haven't since January, sparking fears among their families that they were missing

They have not posted any pictures of their trip on Facebook in more than four weeks and Mr Hand's cellphone has gone unanswered.

Up until then, the couple had been regularly updating friends and family with news of their adventurous travels.

The couple are biking enthusiasts who both work in cycle stores in the Bay Area of San Francisco.

They had customized their bikes especially for the trip which began in December. They had also traveled to Chile and Argentina before deciding to go to the Amazon instead of Machu Picchu in Peru.

Friends told KTVU that they had hoped the couple simply had mechanical issues with their bikes but after they were spotted in the Peruvian capital, it seemed unlikely.

The U.S. Embassy in Peru along with local police are now looking clues as to what happened to the couple.

The U.S. Embassy's website 
posted a warning for travelers about a kidnapping threat in the region on February 
13.

Authorities said that American 
citizens should be aware of the threat from a criminal 
gang in the Cusco and Machu Picchu regions through the month of February.

The U.S. Embassy has severely limited travel for officials at this time and has warned travelers to be on high alert.

The families of both Mr Hand and Miss Neal have created a Facebook page which they want to be widely shared among travelers in Peru in the hope of finding out their loved ones.

Garrett Hand is 25 years old, has blonde hair, green eyes and is 6ft tall. Miss Neal, 27, has brown, curly hair, blue eyes and is 5'5.
