More than one million motorists from around the world have exchanged their foreign licences for a British one in the last 15 years, it emerged today.

According the figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, the number of licences exchanged per year
peaked at 96,935 in 2007, before falling to 79,187 in 2009. Over the 
past three years, the number has risen steadily once again, reaching 
83,553 in 2011.

Currently, the UK recognises the driving licences awarded to drivers by 50 
other countries, meaning they
can be exchanged after 12 months of residency for a UK licence without 
the holder needing to pass any UK test.

Drivers from 50 countries can exchange their licence for a British one after 12 months without taking a test

Almost half of the licences swapped 
since 1997 have been gained in a country where the driving test doesn't 
include driving on the left.

Robin Reames, chief claims officer at 
swiftcover.com which uncovered the figures, said: 'These figures reflect Britain's 
multi-cultural society demonstrating that we are welcoming an increasing
number of motorists to our shores who are choosing to live and drive 
here.

'However, UK roads are very different to those overseas so it's 
vital that new motorists learn as much as they can, which could include 
taking a few lessons from an instructor if necessary.'

Since 1997, drivers from South Africa and Australia accounted for the highest number of licences exchanged with 149,897 and 
103,053 respectively.

However, as more countries entered the EU in 2004,
allowing licences to be exchanged from eastern European countries, 
Polish (135,079 – average of 8,442 per year), Bulgarian (18,719) and 
Hungarian (21,714) motorists are actively exchanging their licences.

About 88,000 Polish drivers exchanged their licence for a UK version in the 
five years between 2004 and 2008.

The data goes on to show that on 
average each year since 1997, 2,334 drivers exchanged Japanese licences for UK one.

Figures also show
2,895 drivers exchanged Hong Kong licences and 836 drivers exchanged 
South Korean licences for full British permits.

Research carried out by the BBC earlier this year highlighted a scam where drivers obtained a UK driving 
licence by exploiting the arrangement that the UK has with Hong Kong – 
which saw more than 6,000 exchanged every year for the past five years, 
even though the average is much lower.

Agreements also exist with some African 
countries. Around 950 Zimbabwean licences were exchanged in 2011, down from 
1,282 in 2010 and a peak of 6,168 in 2002.

Nearly half of the licences exchanged since 1997 are from countries where the test does not require driving on the left hand lane

The UK's agreement with Kenya
was suspended in 2002 then later reinstated, resulting in 242 Kenyan 
licences being exchanged in the early part of 2012.

Robin Reames added: 'While the fact 
that the UK recognises licences issued in certain countries shows that 
driving tests in those countries are likely to be of a high standard, 
it's important to recognise that driving in the UK is unique in many 
ways.

'As such, it's important for everyone planning to drive in the UK 
to take the time to become familiar with UK road signs and speed limits,
as well as driver etiquette – exactly as British motorists should when 
driving abroad.'

Nick Perry, driving instructor at 
Bristol-based Oasis Driving School, commented: 'People who learned to 
drive abroad will often face difficulties driving in the UK.

'The obvious
differences include driving on a different side of the road and new 
signs and speed limits, but there are also more subtle differences such 
as etiquette on the road that seem obvious to us, but are extremely 
important.

'I've taught a range of drivers who have originally learned 
to drive outside the UK, some of whom have settled in with no problems 
and others who've needed a little help.

'It's a good idea for anyone new 
to UK roads to take a short lesson or two with an approved driving 
instructor in order to be on the safe side.'
