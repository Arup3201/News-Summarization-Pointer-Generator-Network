A martial arts expert known as the Norwich Ninja has displayed his superhuman abilities by sitting in the snow wearing only a pair of shorts in a state of deep meditation for 30 minutes.

Martin Faulks, 34, endures temperatures of -4C while sat completely still outside - with only a video camera recording his feat for company.

The married father-of-one, from Norwich, recorded the short film yesterday as Norfolk was blanketed in three inches of snow.

Martin uses the powers of his mind to survive the freezing temperatures after dedicating his life to following the ancient art of Ninjutsu.

The 34-year-old, who claims to be as 'silent as a jaguar', can pick locks and walk through fire after years of training. 

He claims his stalking skills are so honed that he can creep up quietly and touch a deer - although he admits he used to do the same with foxes until one bit him.

Martin, a publisher by day, has dedicated his life to following the ancient art of Ninjutsu and the stunning act of endurance is just part of his continuing training.

Martin needs total tranquility in order 
to focus his mind and hides out in the woods of Norfolk at 6am to 
perfect his meditative feat.

He said: 'I wouldn't recommend anyone try this if they have not had the appropriate training.

'I have spent the last 17 years studying the meditative arts morning and evening and under guidance I have built up my body bit by bit.

'I've been practicing meditating outdoors for years and as the months get colder I enjoy finding out how much I can stand.'

Martin says that while he is sat in freezing temperatures he is able to control his internal thermostat so that he feels like he is sitting on a beach in scorching sunshine.

The practice is called Tummo in Tibet - a form of yoga which means Inner Fire.

A fall in core temperature of only 1C can lead to hypothermia but practitioners of Tummo claim to be able to generate their own body heat.

Dutchman Wim Hof currently holds 18 world records for enduring extreme cold and claims to use the tantric practice to control his body temperature.

Martin said: 'It's not actually that 
bad once you get the hang of it. When you have a fever your inner 
thermostat can generate large amounts of heat so through meditation I am
 able to tell my body to heat up.

'In this case, I'm completely warm and comfortable like you would be when you are sat in the sun on holiday.

'I'm
 not imagining myself anywhere in particular, I'm just completely in 
touch with my body and telling it to increase its temperature.

'Just like you might turn up the heat in your house, I can do it with my body as long I can retain focus.'

The
 technique, which Martin has perfected by training with Taoist martial 
artists in China and the bodyguard to the Dalai Lama, is extremely 
advanced and must only be practiced by those who have received proper 
training.

He said: 'I have to find somewhere where I won't be disturbed so I normally do it just before sunrise.

'It was very windy on Saturday which obviously makes it a bit more difficult.

'In cold running water I can withstand about 10 to 15 minutes and in snow like that I do about half an hour.'

In the past, Martin has filmed himself
 standing under a freezing cold waterfall in order to toughen up his 
body for the rigours of ninja life.

He has also travelled the world to train with ninja masters, test his stealth and endurance and learn the necessary skills.

However,
 his work often takes him to dangerous places and he once hurt his 
shoulder falling out of a tree and dislocated a finger as he practised 
acrobatics.

In 2009, Martin 
put his ninja skills into practice when he single-handedly fended off a 
gang of would-be muggers in London and came to a woman's rescue in 
Norwich when she was attacked by a man.

Ninjas, also known as shinobi, have been feared and revered throughout history for their talents as assassins, scouts and spies. They are mainly noted for their use of stealth and deception but also for their amazing powers of endurance.

Ninjutsu can be translated as ‘Art of Stealth' but also means ‘Art of Enduring' and the ninjas themselves were noted for being able to walk long distances without stopping, jump over seven feet and dislocate their joints to escape from small spaces.

Martin filmed his latest physical feat to show how the mind can hold the answer to the body's external problems. His abilities are due to be studied by the Applied Physiology department at Portsmouth University who have been conducting studies into people cold responses for many years.

He said: 'I believe that we have far more potential as human beings than we are led to believe.

'The mind can bring healing and help us to recover from illness. I believe it can also help to promote well-being and provide us with the solutions to many of our problems.

'At a time when the use of anti-depressants is at an all-time high and people are turning more and more to medicine for solutions to their external problems, I hope to inspire people and teach them that the solutions can be found within themselves.

'People are a lot stronger than they think they are.'
