The brothers of the Cleveland kidnapping suspect Ariel Castro appear distraught and angry in a newly released police video from the day that they were booked into jail along with their brother.

The video, obtained by WKYC.com, shows Onil Castro, 50, waving his hands and appearing to shout at his brother as they were booked. At one point, he smacks his head into a glass window several times.

Onil and brother Pedro Castro were later released from jail. The video was taken several hours after Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight were found alive in Ariel Castro's home on Seymour Avenue in Cleveland.

They had been held captive for a decade in Ariel Castro's home on Seymour Avenue in Cleveland.

Ariel stands stoically between his two brothers during the booking.

The video emerged 
as the brothers gave their first interview since the girls were 
discovered. The brothers spoke of how they had no idea why they were 
being arrested. They also revealed that prior to the arrests, they had 
seen the daughter that Ariel fathered with Amanda Berry during her 
captivity.

On two different 
occasions they saw Ariel bring the young girl to fast food restaurants- 
one time at McDonald's and another at Burger King. Each time, he said 
that the girl was his girlfriend's daughter.

Onil Castro was in
the car with his brother Ariel when police pulled them over in a 
McDonalds parking lot and his first thought was that Ariel had run a red
light. Pedro Castro was woken up at his home by police, and he thought 
that they were arresting him for an outstanding open container warrant.

They
were both far off base, as they only learned when they arrived at the 
police station and were questioned separately about the three young 
women that Ariel had secretly kept in his house.

Pedro said that once at the station, he asked what he was being charged with and a police officer wrote the word 'kidnapping' down on a piece of paper and handed it to him.

'I didn't have my reading glasses, I looked and I said, "Oh, open containers." She said 2No, read it again." And I said "Oh!  Kidnapping!  What's this?  Kidnapping? I'm thinking kidnapping. Who did I kidnap?"' he told CNN.

Pedro was similarly confused, and the only one to have a clue of what was going on was Ariel, who remains behind bars after his bail was set at $8million.

'He goes "Onil, I'm sorry. You didn't know nothing about this, Onil. I'm sorry, Onil." And that was it. And then that's when I broke down on my way over there. I said, "What did my brother do? What did he do?"' Onil told CNN.

Set up: Onil Castro (seen at his arrest at left and during the interview at right) was with his brother Ariel when police pulled them over in a McDonalds parking lot, and he said that maybe Ariel wanted to be caught

'When he walked past me, he goes, "Onil, you're never going to see me again. I love you bro." And that was it. And he put his fist up for a bump.'

They consider their brother to be a 'monster' and said that one of the worst moments for them came when they realized that Gina DeJesus was one of the kidnapping victims since they are friends with her father, Felix.

'I knew him for a long time and when I found out that Arial had Gina, I  just broke down its just shocking. Ariel, we know this guy for a long time and you got his daughter and you go round like nothing, you even went to the vigils, you had posters, you give his mama  a hug and you got his daughters captive?' Pedro said in disbelief in the interview that aired Monday morning.

Pedro told of how one time he saw Ariel bring a young girl to the local McDonalds- the girl that is now known to be Jocelyn who the 52-year-old fathered with his kidnapping victim Amanda Berry.

'I seen Ariel with a little girl at McDonald's and I asked him who's that and he said "This is a girlfriend's of mine,"' Pedro Castro told CNN.

In the dark: Pedro Castro described how on the few occasions they went to their brother Ariel's house, he would keep them in the kitchen or outside on the steps

When he saw the 
same young girl at Burger King with Ariel on a different occasion, he 
asked where the mother was but Ariel just said she was busy.

The brothers said 
that they had no inkling about the years of abuse that went on at their 
brother's house because they never had a thorough tour of his home on 
Seymour Avenue.

On
the rare occasions that they did visit his home, they stayed in the 
kitchen and could not see into the other areas because Ariel had put up 
curtains blocking the other rooms. He explained that it was a energy 
saving technique.

'The
reason why we would go in the kitchen, because he had alcohol. And he 
would take me in the kitchen, give me a shot,' Pedro said.

Other ways that he would keep his guests from suspecting any criminal activity was to constantly have a radio or TV on so that it would drown out any background noise, and they would never spend much time actually indoors, opting to eat out on the steps instead.

The brothers, who were arrested along with Ariel Castro but later released due to a lack of evidence, say that since their release from prison, they have been faced with online death threats, a break-in at one of their homes, and vandalism.

Busted: Ariel Castro is facing kidnapping and rape charges, and his brothers say they would have turned him in sooner had they known

When asked by CNN reporter Martin Savidge if the public would always suspect they had a role in the kidnappings, they answered 'yes' in unison.

Onil Castro said: 'The people out there who know me, they know that Onil Castro is not that person, has nothing to do with that - would never even think of something like that. I was a very liked person [before the arrest], never had any enemies.

'[There is] no 
reason for anybody to think that I would ever do something like that. It
was a shock to all my friends. They couldn’t believe it.'

Pedro Castro 
added: 'I couldn’t never think of doing anything like that. If I knew 
that my brother was doing this, in a minute I would have called the 
cops; cause that ain’t right. But yeah, it’s going to haunt me down. 
Cause people are going to think Pedro had something to do with this and 
pedro don’t have anything to  do this.

They said that even though Castro is their brother, they would have had no choice but to turn him in - had they known.

'If I knew, I would have reported it, brother or no brother.'

The brothers spoke amid new revelations of odd behavior at the Castro house in the days prior to the women's escape.

Mark Sanchez, who lives in the neighborhood and shares Castro's affinity for the bass guitar, told The Daily Telegraph that he was at Castro's home on May 2 when he heard weird thudding sounds coming from the floor above.

Mr Sanchez also saw a little girl at one point whom he claimed he had never seen before.

Castro explained that the child was his granddaughter.

Free: A neighbor got a picture of Amanda Berry as she escaped the home last Monday with her six-year-old daughter, who the kidnapper's brothers previously saw with Ariel on trips to McDonalds

Freed: Amanda Berry (center), Gina DeJesus 
(left) and Michelle Knight (right) were held captive for ten years after
being abducting from the street between 2002 and 2004

Escape route: The women escaped through the front door of Castro's home after a neighbor helped them

Days later, he was horrified to learn about what had been going on in the house for more than a decade.

Mr Sanchez told the paper that he would always have to arrange plans to hang out with Castro in advance - because he never answered the door if he showed up without letting Castro know first.

He told the Telegraph: 'I have to say the guy was a demon but he played it real cool. It was the first time that I heard any noise.'

Ariel Castro is suspected of holding the women captive in his home for a decade.

Authorities say he kidnapped all three women - Michelle Knight, Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus, raped them and fathered a child with one.

The women were found May 6 after one escaped and called 911.

The brothers were initially taken into custody but released Thursday after investigators said there was no evidence against them.
