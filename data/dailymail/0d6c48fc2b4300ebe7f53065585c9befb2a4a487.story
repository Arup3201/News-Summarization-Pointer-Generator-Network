Frank Lampard was at England’s team hotel in  Manchester with Chelsea  team-mates John Terry, Joe Cole and Wayne Bridge when he first met Jose Mourinho.

That was in 2004, when England were preparing for the European Championship in Portugal and Mourinho was a Champions League winner with Porto. It was the start of a special relationship.

Mourinho convinced Lampard and the rest of that team he would turn them into winners after years of near misses under Claudio Ranieri. Sure enough the midfielder, who confirmed yesterday he is leaving  Chelsea after 13 years, went on to pretty much sweep the board.

2008 Won UEFA club midfielder of the year award.

3 Times named Chelsea player of the year: 2005, 2006, 2010.

He won three Premier League titles, the Champions League, Europa League, four FA Cups and two League Cups with Chelsea, since joining from West Ham for £11million in 2001. His biggest regret is that he has not had a chance to say goodbye to the 40,000 fans who worship him at Stamford Bridge.

He broke the great Bobby Tambling’s club goalscoring record when he hit the 202nd and 203rd goals of his Chelsea career against Aston Villa in May 2013. He leaves with a tally of 211, having finished top scorer four times, winning the club’s player of the year award on three occasions.

Lampard’s appetite for the game remains undiminished. The legs may be tiring after 15 years at the top, but he wants to carry on beyond the World Cup.

The 
forthcoming tournament will be his last hurrah in an England shirt - he 
is likely to retire from international football upon their exit - but 
his club career will continue. The England vice-captain turns 36 on June
 20. It is time for something new.

Lampard
 read the signs last season, when there were  ruthless changes under 
Mourinho and regular appearances on the substitutes’ bench. Life on the 
sidelines is not for one of  English football’s modern greats, who 
commands respect and recognition wherever football takes him.

Think
 of Alessandro Del Piero’s love affair with Juventus, the Old Lady of 
Turin, or Paolo Maldini’s emotional attachment to AC Milan. Lampard has 
earned his place in Chelsea folklore.

He
 has won admirers for his devotion to the sport and his ability to score
 so many goals, sometimes under almost intolerable pressure. In 2008, 
days after his mum Pat passed away, he scored from the penalty spot in a
 Champions League semi-final against Rafa Benitez’s Liverpool.

A
 few weeks later, when Avram Grant led the team out in Moscow’s 
Luzhniki  Stadium for the final, he scored Chelsea’s equaliser against 
Manchester United. That time, he ended up with a loser’s medal after 
Chelsea lost in a shootout.

The
 following year, infamously, he phoned James O’Brien’s radio show on LBC
 after the presenter claimed he had ‘let down his kids’ following a 
split with model Elen Rives.

Not
 only did O’Brien fail to realise it was the anniversary of Lampard’s 
mum’s death, but the player’s children, Luna and Isla, spend three 
nights a week with their father at his Knightsbridge home. They are a 
major consideration for him now that he is on the verge of moving to New
 York City.

Mourinho wanted Lampard to stay and had encouraged the midfielder to start taking his coaching badges.

In
 the coach’s first season at Chelsea, he approached Lampard after 
training to tell him he had become the best midfielder in the world. 
Lampard revealed in his autobiography that it propelled him to even 
greater heights. By then he stood shoulder to shoulder with Andrea 
Pirlo, Steven Gerrard, Xavi and Andres Iniesta.

He
 remained loyal to Chelsea when Mourinho tried to lure him to Inter 
Milan in 2009. It was a close call but Lampard opted to stay at Stamford
 Bridge, fulfilling all his  ambitions with the club on a mind-boggling 
contract worth £150,000 a week.

He
 only fell out with one manager — Andre Villas-Boas — during a 
disastrous seven-month spell at Chelsea in 2011-12. Lampard finished 
that season by lifting the Champions League trophy in the Allianz Arena 
after the final against Bayern Munich.

The following year, under interim coach Benitez, Chelsea won the Europa League with victory over Benfica in the Amsterdam Arena.

That was the last trophy Lampard won with Chelsea, but his legacy will live on. At 35, he is a true giant of the game.
