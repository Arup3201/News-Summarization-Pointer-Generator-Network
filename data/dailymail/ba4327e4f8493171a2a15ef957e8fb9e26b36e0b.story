A pair of ramblers spent nearly an hour trapped on top of a flimsy wooden stile after being cornered by two angry bulls.

Jennifer O’Malley and her partner Dave Alden were walking in Altarnun, Cornwall, when the aggressive animals blocked their path.

The couple sat on top of the stile for almost an hour before having to drag themselves through a hedge to safety.

Jenny O'Malley and her partner, Dave Alden, were walking in Altarnun in Cornwall when they were cornered by two angry bulls

The couple climbed onto a flimsy wooden stile to stay out of the animals' reach where they were trapped for almost an hour

Mr Alden tried to run to safety in a nearby field but was butted back into the fence, suffering a painful cut to his wrist.

The pair then decided to wait in the hope the menacing bulls would grow tired and wander off.

But neither showed any sign of backing down, leaving the couple stuck for 45 minutes. 

They eventually escaped by crawling sideways through a thick hedge between the fields, scratching themselves in the process.

Mr Alden filmed their ordeal on his mobile phone to warn others about the aggressive animals.

The video shows the two bulls snorting and scraping the earth with their hooves, as if poised to charge. 

He says: 'So here we are on a public footpath. This is the stile in the middle. We’ve got this bull on this side and this bull on this side.' 

Mr Alden's wrist was injured when the bull butted him into a fence after he tried to run away

Terrified: Jennifer O'Malley said she'd never encountered anything like it and has now been put off walking

'We’ve got this bull on this side and this bull on this side': The animals surrounded the couple on a public footpath

He then points the camera at his wrist to reveal a bloody gash, adding: 'I tried going on this side - this is what the bull gave me when he pushed me into the fence.'

Ms O'Malley said afterwards that the couple had no choice but to claw their way through thick brambles to escape.

She said: 'It was nearly impenetrable and we got scratched to bits but it was the only option we had.

'I’ve never encountered anything like it. 

'We think the bulls were trying to get to each other, but they were snorting, bellowing and pawing the ground and we were stuck in the middle with nowhere to go.

'It really was quite awful and so terrifying it’s put me off walking.'

The couple have complained to the police and local council about the animals.

Experts said the bulls were likely squaring up to fight one another - and the two ramblers were simply caught in the middle.

The National Farmers’ Union said the incident was 'mercifully very, very, rare'.

Spokesman Ian Johnson said while most farmers take their responsibilities and obligations very seriously, things can very occasionally go wrong.

He said: 'We don’t know the exact circumstances about how the bulls ended up in the fields, but what happened sounds pretty traumatic.

'I’ve seen and heard bulls bellowing at each other and I wouldn’t want to be anywhere near that.'
