UEFA chief Michel Platini is determined to ban clubs from European competitions in 12 months if they continue to stick two fingers up at financial fair play regulations – causing further problems for the toxic Qatar brand.

Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City and Qatari-owned Paris St Germain have already been punished with a heavy fine and squad reduction after running up excessive losses.

Platini is now prepared to push through the ultimate sanction – exclusion from the Champions League – for repeat offenders.

Significantly, he has the backing of many of Europe’s leading clubs including Arsenal, Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Chelsea and Manchester United who argue spending should fall in line with revenue.

Ironically, Europe’s governing body are not expecting further problems with City, whose owner Sheikh Mansour is working hard on cutting losses.

City reported losses of £51.6m in their latest set of financial figures in January which broke Uefa’s £37million threshold, but it was greatly reduced from the previous year’s deficit of £97.9m.

But Paris St Germain, Qatar Sport Investment, a venture of the Qatari government, have incensed Platini and other Uefa bigwigs by completing the £48milion signing of David Luiz from Chelsea while they were being warned about their over-spending.

It is seen within the game’s governing body as deliberately provocative and is leading to a resolve that they will punish Paris more severely unless they take heed of Uefa’s wishes.

Qatar is already under huge international scrutiny following allegations that they used bribery as a tool to be awarded the 2022 World Cup.

Too far: PSG have incensed Platini by signing Chelsea's David Luiz for £48million during over-spending row

City and Paris were each fined £49million by Uefa last month, £32million of which was suspended, after failing financial fair play rules.

In addition, they can only name a 21-man Champions League squad next season instead of he usual 25, and can spend only £49million net in transfers in this window, and not increase the club’s overall wage bill.

A senior source said: ‘There is a perception that Platini doesn’t want to take Paris St Germain on because they are a French club.  

‘But the reality is he and others are fuming at the way they seem to be carry on spending despite already being fined. There is a real resolution within Uefa and among the other clubs to impose a Champions League ban on any club that carries on playing outside the rules.’

Qatar have spent millions trying to gain respectability through football, sponsoring Barcelona among other clubs as well as buying Paris and winning a vote to host the World Cup.

But the game's rulers are now aware of a public backlash against a perception of Qatar "buying" football and are determined not to allow Paris to outspend other clubs.
