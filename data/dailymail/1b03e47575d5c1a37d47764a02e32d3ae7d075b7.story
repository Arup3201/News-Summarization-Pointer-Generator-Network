Martin Keown believes his old side Arsenal have always been liable to a suckerpunch during big games, but the former England international was hugely encouraged by the recent victory against Manchester City.

Arsenal produced an impressive away performance at the Etihad earlier this month as goals from Santi Cazorla and Olivier Giroud earned a rare victory on the road against one of the Premier League's big teams.

Arsene Wenger's side delivered an effective defensive display against the champions, the likes of which Arsenal fans haven't seen in recent years.

And Keown, who likened his former team to a boxer that was susceptible to a knockout, was full of praise for the way the Gunners midfield protected a defence that has looked vulnerable all to often.

'Sometimes Arsenal can be like a boxer. Yes they throw punches but it might not be long before they’re dropped to the canvas. 

'That’s what had happened with Arsenal in recent times – losing the big games early on.

'But against City they were much more controlled and protected their defence far better with their midfield players before breaking with purpose and energy. 

'It was such a controlled, professional performance. You can’t always win games by strangling the opposition through possession. 

'But that message will have 100 per cent come from Arsene Wenger, not the players.'
