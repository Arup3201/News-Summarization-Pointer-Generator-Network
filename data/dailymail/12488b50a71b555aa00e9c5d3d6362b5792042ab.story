Head teachers reacted with anger yesterday after a ski company offered to pay the truancy fines of parents who take their children on term-time holidays.

The firm, which is selling trips to Morzine in the French Alps, will cover penalties imposed on parents who break rules by taking their children out of school.

MountainBase advertised the offer with the slogan: ‘Are schools in the UK taking the Piste? We think so.’

But heads branded the gimmick ‘irresponsible’ and ‘extremely unhelpful’.

Offer: Travel company MountainBase is offering parents the chance to take their children skiing without having to fork out fines imposed under new Government rules, which makes taking children out of school without permission for a holiday a criminal offence

The advert, posted on Facebook and on the Bedford-based operator’s website, reads: ‘We have a special offer which is as follows – Book a week with children at MountainBase/Inferno.

‘We will, if you receive a fine from your school/local authority, pay the fine on copy of a receipt from yourselves. This is based on any booking in March/April except the free ski pass option.’

New rules introduced last year severely curtail the discretion of head teachers to allow parents to take their children on term-time holidays.

They used to be able to grant up to ten days in certain ‘special circumstances’.

But now they must follow tougher  criteria, ruling out holidays for all but ‘exceptional’ reasons such as attending funerals.

Parents who take their children out of school without consent risk a fine of £60, rising to £120 if it is unpaid within seven days. Refusal to pay can mean a maximum fine of £2,500 and up to three years in jail.

Rising numbers of parents are being hit with charges after the Government hardened its stance.

MountainBase owner Lee Quince said 
the rule change unfairly targeted parents who simply wish to give their 
children different experiences.

‘The
 whole change regarding term-time holidays, which was aimed at tackling 
the problem of truancy, has directly affected families who want to take 
their children on holiday but cannot afford to go.

'That is because prices are so high during school holidays,’ he said.

‘The Government was targeting compulsive truants but has hit innocent families who just want to teach their kids how to ski.’

Asked
 if he was being ‘irresponsible’, he said: ‘Yes, in one way but also the
 law has changed to specifically address truancy, especially in the wake
 of the riots.

‘In some sense that’s affecting people who are not in that set, it’s a law change not destined for themselves.’

Advertising: The company posted this message on its Facebook page, offering to pay fines incurred by parents who take their children skiing in term-time

He told Radio 5 Live: ‘Parents know the situation at the time and whether or not their children are doing well in school.

‘We are offering something that is only available at certain times of the year. Also, it is a sporting holiday and not just sitting on the beach.’

Brian Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ‘This is extremely unhelpful.

‘Travel companies should be supporting the education system by offering competitive prices and offering incentives for parents to take children away during the school holidays.

‘These rules about attendance have been introduced because children need to be in school.’

A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘Parents should never discount a possible penalty from the cost of a cheaper holiday.

‘Taking children out of school without permission for a holiday is a criminal offence. By doing so  parents are risking prosecution.’
