She's a 69-year-old grandmother who stands at just four foot nine inches tall, but she's also a world-record breaking weightlifter.

Meet Pat Reeves from Kingswinford, West Midlands, who has been competing in powerlifting for the last 26 years and currently holds both the World Champion and British Champion titles in her category. 

Pat specialises in deadlifts, where a loaded barbel is lifted off the ground and up to the hips, then put back down on the ground. 

Although she weighs just 7st 9lbs (50 kilos), she regularly lifts around 90 to 100 kilos - twice her body weight.

Now preparing for her 70th birthday, the pensioner is hoping to break further world records by being the oldest woman in the world to compete in her category next year.

She said: 'I suppose you could say I'm not a conventional grandma, I'm not about to start knitting - I have dumbbells. 

'There is no age limit and that's wonderful, that's one of the wonderful things about powerlifting, you can keep going for as long as you're alive basically. 

'Keeping in shape is more important to me than getting old. Age is just a number. 

'I have no intention of feeling 70 while I don't have to. 

Pat Reeves works out regularly in her home gym, where she has been lifting weights for the last 26 years 

'I now compete in the 50.5 weight category and have done for the last four or five years.'

Powerlifting consists of three disciplines - squat lifts, bench press and dead lifts. 

First breaking the world 'deadlift' record back in March, 2010, when she was 64-years-old, Pat has remained determined to hang on to her title – competing every year and upping her record by 0.5 kilos every time. 

Today, she carries the deadlifting World Champion title and British Champion title for her weight and age category, as well as being the oldest female competitor in Europe.

Pat first took up weightlifting 26 years ago, when she was 38 

She said: 'I don't think I ever come across anyone who thinks I'm mad. 

'People are bemused by it and some of them will come around and watch me compete. 

'And I've never met anyone who said you're too old for this - except a doctor many years ago. 

He said "You're too old to lift, give it up." 

'That was probably 18 years ago - it's great proving people wrong.' 

Pat even claims that her hobby has helped her to battle cancer twice. 

Pat claims a healthy diet of raw foods has helped her to battle cancer 

She first took up weightlifting after becoming diagnosed with brain cancer in 1983 and says that doctors advised the disease was terminal but that she could prolong her life with drugs.

Pat turned her back on traditional hospital treatment in favour of healthy-eating and exercise, which she claims was responsible for her beating the disease.  

She said: 'When I was first diagnosed with cancer doctors told me I would under chemotherapy, radiotherapy, drugs and the prognosis was still the same, I was going to die.

'I didn't want to believe it, I wanted a second opinion and that came back with the same grave results.'

I was totally unsatisfied with the NHS that I took matters into my own hands and improved my health.

Pat has been competing in weightlifting competitions since taking up the sport in the 80's 

'I dramatically improved my diet which was poor before, initially I just started with a healthier diet, lots of fruit and veg and I did a lot of research about the health benefits of different foods.

'The main thing was exercise, I took up running and then realised it was only really working me from the waist down. 

'I then began body building and a coach suggested I got into powerlifting.'

After being cleared of brain cancer, Pat was then diagnosed with osteosarcoma – in the shape of 14 bone cancer tumours – in 1994.

She claims that her exercise regime combined with a diet of raw foods was responsible for once again curing her of the disease. 

She said: 'The powerlifting kept me strong, it worked my whole body and it kept me focused.

'I think we get out of our bodies what we put into them, I healed my body by being good to it with exercise and diet.'

But experts warn that this is not a sensible method of curing cancer and should only be used as a complimentary therapy alongside traditional hospital treatment.  

Oncologist Professor Karol Sikora said: ‘The problem with alternative medicines is they are difficult to disprove and difficult to prove any benefits.

‘This really is an extreme course of treatment and certainly not to be recommended at all.

‘Many doctors are now fans of complementary alternative therapies alongside other treatments but not to replace it.

‘Anyone considering alternative therapies for cancer should discuss it with their consultant first.’
