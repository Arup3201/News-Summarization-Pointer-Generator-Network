Great-grandfather George Bates, 76, was beaten unconscious outside his home after asking a woman who was swearing on the street to be quiet

A great-grandfather was beaten unconscious outside his home after stepping outside to ask a swearing woman to keep it down.

Retired mechanic George Bates, 76, went outside to ask a woman who was talking loudly on her phone to lower her voice.

Moments later a man launched a vicious attack on him, hitting the pensioner over the head and causing him fall to the ground outside his home in Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire.

Mr Bates was lying in his bed at 6pm on January 3 when the commotion began outside.

After half an hour, the great-grandfather went out to ask the woman to be quiet.

He said: 'There was a young woman ranting and raving on her phone. She was using foul language. I thought it was outside my house - but when I went to the door, it was across the street.

'I went over and said "Do you mind?" and that I had had enough. I told her I was going to ring the police.

'Just as I started to walk away, a man came round the corner and the next thing I know was I heard a whack.' 

'I was in quite a lot of pain and I am a bit nervous to go out now. It is not what you expect when you are in your 70s.' 

Mr Bates, who suffered severe bruising and swelling around his eyes and face, managed to make his way back home after the assault.

The pensioner did not report the incident to the police straight away - and it was not until his daughter, a nurse, visited him the next day and saw his injuries that officers were called.

The 76-year-old was unable to describe what his attacker looked like because the incident happened so quickly. 

Police have now launched an investigation to try to track down the man and the woman.

Police are now appealing for any information on the attack on Thwaites Road (pictured) in Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire

PC Stuart King, of Lancashire Police, said: 'This was an unprovoked attack on an elderly man who has suffered a nasty injury to his face as a result.

'I appeal to anyone who may have seen the incident to contact us.

'I urge anybody who may have any information about the woman, who was on her phone for around 15 to 30 minutes in the area, to get in touch.'

Councillor Peter Britcliffe, who represents Oswaldtwistle on Hyndburn Council, said he was appalled to hear about the attack.

He said: 'My thoughts go out to Mr Bates. It is a dreadful incident. If anybody knows anything, I hope they contact the police.

'Let us hope this person is brought to justice quickly because they are not the sort of person we want in Oswaldtwistle.'
