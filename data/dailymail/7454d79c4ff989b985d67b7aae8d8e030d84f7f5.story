Two adventurous French friends show that every cloud has a silver lining as they embrace the most challenging of weather conditions.

A biblical downpour of rain, which leads to excessive flooding, fails to quell the exuberance of the two outdoor enthusiasts who paddle down a Montpellier street in a canoe.

A local resident filmed the footage of the significant floods and the spontaneous canoe ride which followed using a GoPro camera. 

The footage shows two the two men canoeing down the side of a busy road near passing cars during flooding which occurred from Sunday into early on Monday morning.

The friends can be heard laughing sporadically as they take turns using the canoe and braving the challenging weather conditions. 

Al Jazeera reported that, in the space of just three hours, a massive 252mm of rain fell in the city of Montpellier. 

The widespread flooding has adversely affected multiple areas and regions in France.

In 60 southern towns France has declared a state of natural disaster.
