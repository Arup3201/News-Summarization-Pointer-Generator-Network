They have survived hundreds of years and provide a fascinating insight into ancient civilisations, but papyrus scrolls are now being sold in online auctions, potentially putting the manuscripts at risk.

The scrolls, some dating back as far as the 3rd century, are being sold on eBay for large sums of money, but experts fear that private collectors are damaging the precious papyrus.

Ancient papyrus scrolls are being sold in online auctions, with experts fearing the manuscripts could be damaged. This section of Paul's Epistle to the Romans was bought at Sotheby's for £301,000

In another sale, a third century parchment sheet containing a section of Paul's Epistle to the Romans was bought at Sotheby's for £301,000, astonishing experts.

While neither of these sales were unlawful, scholars fear some buyers are carving up larger scrolls to sell online for profit.

Brice Jones, a papyrologist and lecturer in New Testament and Early Christianity at Concordia University in Montreal, told the Sunday Telegraph that private collectors were also damaging the ancient manuscripts.

He said: 'The study of ancient papyri is a fascinating field of historical inquiry, because these artifacts are the fingerprints of real people from a bygone era.

'Each time I study a new papyrus, it is as if I am peeking over the shoulders of the scribe who wrote it, eavesdropping on a conversation that in many cases was meant to be private: an argument between a husband and wife, a divorce contract, an invitation to dinner, a letter between a father and son.

'But when private collectors acquire papyri for personal enjoyment and restrict scholarly access to them, the immediate consequence is that we lose valuable historical information that would otherwise advance our knowledge about ancient people.'

One example Mr Jones used was that of the papyrus codex of the Gospel of Judas, which was stored in safety deposit box by its owner and then placed in a freezer as the collector believed that was the best way to preserve it.

'The results of these decisions were horrifying: the codex crumbled into many hundreds of tiny pieces and what was once a virtually complete codex was now badly deteriorated and difficult to restore,' Mr Jones said.

The papyrus expert added that he spends hours trawling through auction websites, such as eBay, looking for scrolls being sold, as well as forgeries.

An eBay spokesman said sellers on the website 'must ensure listings comply with our clear policy on artifacts. We work with regulators, law enforcement and other parties including the Egyptian Embassy to apply this policy, and if a listing of concern is identified we will require proof that it was legally exported and remove any listing where this proof is not provided.'
