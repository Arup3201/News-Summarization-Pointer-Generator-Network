Lionsgate is launching a touring exhibition of The Hunger Games as the first step toward opening a theme park dedicated to the wildly-popular book and film series.

The movie studio revealed that it's 'deep into conversation' with potential theme park partners.

The post-apocalyptic franchise has proved a substantial money-maker for Lionsgate, grossing nearly £1billion at the box office, and the company is looking for new ways to cash in on its success.

Movie magic: Lionsgate revealed that it's 'deep into conversation' about opening a Hunger Games theme park

The four-part series has yet to release its final two installments, with the third - The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1 - set to arrive in cinemas in November. 

But can the studio turn a successful film franchise into a profitable theme park?

Lionsgate will begin testing the waters with the launch of a touring exhibit, The Hunger Games: The Exhibition, in the summer of 2015.

The studio has joined forces with theme park creator Thinkwell Group to develop its plans.

'Thinkwell... is spearheading an initiative for line extensions of "The Hunger Games" and all of our other brands,' Lionsgate CEO Jon Feltheimer said during a conference call, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

He said: 'As a first step, we've already designed a state-of-the-art travelling museum involving costumes, props, and other elements of the Hunger Games world that will begin touring the U.S. next summer.'

Now it seems that the studio is eyeing an even grander presence.

During Friday's conference call, Feltheimer revealed that studio execs are 'excited about these [theme park] opportunities and are pursuing them,' reports Businessweek.

He also mentioned that The Hunger Games: The Exhibition would be the first test of several 'extensions' of Lionsgate franchises, which include Twilight and Divergent.

Twilight phenomenon: The vampire-meets-girl love story was a worldwide success

The next big thing: Lionsgate's Divergent is also being eyed as an opportunity for brand 'extension'

Twilight has proved particularly successful for the studio, with the vampire love story's five-film franchise grossing almost £2billion worldwide.

Apocalyptic teen romance 'Divergent' has likewise made a substantial box office impact, netting £164million with its first of four films.

This comes on the heels of Universal Orlando's launch of the Harry Potter-themed extension to 2010's The Wizarding World of Harry Potter.

This summer, Universal Orlando added Diagon Alley, which includes a thrill ride, wand shop, and restaurant

The new area in the studio's Florida park is called The Wizarding World of Harry Potter: Diagon Alley, and cost an estimated £239million.

This is in addition to the initial site's £158million development costs.

At this point, there's no word on whether Lionsgate is looking at developing a stand-alone theme park or simply adding themed attractions into already-existing parks.
