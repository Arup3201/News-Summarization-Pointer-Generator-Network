Mauricio Pochettino is hoping to bring in new signings before Spurs open their Premier League campaign at West Ham next weekend with the club closing in on a £2.75 million deal for Seattle Sounders right back DeAndre Yedlin.

Pochettino denied a deal had been completed for Yedlin but asked about potential signings next week said: ‘In football it’s possible and we will wait to see.’

Yedlin, 21, came on as a substitute in three appearances in the World Cup for the USA, and looks likely to make the move to London but Pochettino will have to wait a little longer to see if Spurs can also bring holding midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin, with Southampton insisting that the Frenchman won’t be sold.

Impressive: £30m man Erik Lamela looks to be in much better form under Mauricio Pochettino than last year

Pochettino at least had some encouragement on Saturday evening as Spurs recorded a comfortable victory over Champions League qualifiers Schalke – though he will have been alarmed by the manner in which Spurs almost let the Bundesliga side back into the game late on.

Tottenham looked to be convincing winners until a shaky last 15 minutes – but at least saw left back Ben Davies get his first run out at White Hart Lane and a good debut from Eric Dier, as well encouraging displays from Emanuel Adebayor, Andros Townsend, Roberto Soldado and Erik Lamela.

Dier, born in Essex, raised in Portugal and signed from Sporting last week, looked comfortable at centre half while Adebayor, who missed the pre-season US tour due to malaria, looked back to near full fitness.

‘It was a good performance and not just Eric but the whole team, said Pochettino. ‘Emmanuel is getting stronger every day after it was impossible for him to come on the US tour, but he’s getting better now.’

With Jan Vertonghen, Michael Dawson, Paulinho and possibly Etienne Capoue to come back into this team and with Kyle Walker recovering from injury, Pochettino hasn’t quite shown his full hand as yet.

And though Spurs moved the ball well enough, Pochettino was a constant presence on the touchline, cajoling his team and urging them to calm down in possession. ‘It’s hard work to translate your philosophy and put it into practice in 25 days but I’m very pleased with the players,’ he said.

Soldado and Adebayor both established credentials for starting at West Ham next week by getting on the score-sheet – but Erik Lamela’s first-half display was the most intriguing.

Pochettino does seem to be coaxing better performances from his compatriot, who barely registered last season after his £30m move from Roma. The Argentine looked sharp, bright and ready to impress in the first half, before being one of a number of half-time substitutions.

Lamela was involved in the opening goal’s build up, sweeping the ball to Aaron Lennon, who in turn moved it on to Lewis Holtby. The former Schalke player drove in a cross and Emmanuel Adebayor controlled and finished well on 29 minutes.

Then Townsend, a second-half substitute, unleashed an excellent strike on 68 minutes which Schalke keeper Ralf Fahrmann did well to push away. First to react though was Soldado, diving forward to send a looping header back over goalkeeper for 2-0.

However, Tottenham’s complacency almost allowed a victory to slip away when Dennis Aogo found room down the left to cross for former Spurs man Kevin-Prince Boateng, who stroked the ball home on 80 minutes. Hugo Lloris then got a rare touch on 83 minutes, being forced to dive to his right to touch away Donis Avdijaj’s strike.
