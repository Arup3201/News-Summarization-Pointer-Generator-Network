England’s Young Lions booked their place in May’s Under 17 European Championship with an impressive 3-1 win over Slovenia at Chesterfield.

John Peacock’s team, the defending European champions, surged into a three-goal lead by half-time courtesy of goals from Reece Oxford and Nathan Holland followed by an own goal by Matija Rom.

Although Slovenia pulled a goal back through Jan Mlakar in the 65th minute, England were worthy winners and advanced to May’s finals in Bulgaria with a match to spare.

Boosted by Saturday’s 3-1 win over Norway at Burton-upon-Trent, England made the short trip north to Chesterfield full of confidence ahead of the second of three Elite Round qualifiers held this week.

And they were soon on the offensive, with visiting goalkeeper Rok Vodisek pushing away a fierce shot from the Leicester striker Layton Ndukwu, who was chasing his fifth goal in Euro qualifying, inside two minutes.

Slovenia, who had easily beaten Romania 3-0 in their first game of the qualifying mini-group on Saturday night, threatened when Timi Max Semic cut inside and forced England goalkeeper Paul Woolston into a low fingertip save.

But England took the lead on 20 minutes and it was all the work of young Everton winger Holland. He helped win a corner with a purposeful run and then swung in a delivery that Oxford, the captain, headed into the top corner.

Back came Slovenia and Newcastle stopper Woolston excelled with a one-handed save to keep out Jacob Novak’s thunderbolt.

While the away side failed to take their chances, England were clinical and were in total command by half-time.

Holland gained a goal that was just reward for his efforts on 36 minutes, playing a one-two with Arsenal man Chris Willock inside the box before drilling the ball into the bottom corner from 10 yards.

And Holland was involved in the third too, which arrived two minutes later. Having advanced into space down the right, his cut-back was sliced by full-back Rom into his own net.

Peacock was allowed the luxury to make changes in the second period and Manchester City duo Will Patching and Lukas Nmecha were given a run-out, as was Tottenham’s Marcus Edwards.

England's victory meant they qualified with five wins from five and still have a group game remaining 

And the latter came close to scoring the fourth following some nifty footwork but his shot from a tight angle was blocked at the near post.

Slovenia deserved something on the balance of play and pulled one back 15 minutes from time when Fiorentina man Mlakar, the skipper, looped home a back post header.

But a comeback never looked likely and England complete their qualifying campaign against Romania at Burton on Thursday knowing their place in the finals is already rubber-stamped.
