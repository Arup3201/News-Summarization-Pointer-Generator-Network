Artist's impression: Anthony McCall had designed Column, a spiral of steam that should have risen up

The Arts Council was last night blasted for wasting £535,000 on a giant steam artwork - which ended up being nothing but hot air.

Artist Anthony McCall had designed Column, a spiral of steam that should have risen more than six miles into the sky from a floating platform on the River Mersey in Wirral, Merseyside.

Now, following huge amounts of National Lottery money being spent on the steam spiral project, the Arts Council has finally admitted defeat after 15 months of repeatedly failing to make it work.

Wirral Metropolitan Borough councillor Jim Crabtree insisted yesterday that the project was ‘a complete and utter waste of public money’.

He said: ‘They should have done their homework before committing £500,000, especially given what we've got going on today - people starving, we've got food banks all over the place. How many people could you feed with £500,000?’

The budget for Mr McCall's project was originally £500,000, including a £40,000 fee for the artist, but it subsequently rose by £35,410. None of the money will be recouped.

The project was set to have run throughout last year as part of the Cultural Olympiad tie-in with London 2012. Column was originally due to launch in December 2011 and run for 12 months.

The steam spiral was intended to have risen from East Float dock in Birkenhead and been visible for at least 62 miles on a clear day, becoming a ‘nationally and internationally recognised landmark’.

But it was repeatedly delayed. The Civil Aviation Authority was worried that it would interfere with aircraft and the Port Health Authority had concerns that it could cause Legionella.

Vision: Mr McCall's working maquette of Column. The Arts Council has finally admitted defeat after repeatedly failing to make the full version work

However even after those fears were 
allayed, the steam-generating mechanism did not work properly and the 
column still did not appear.

Such vertical steam spirals occur 
occasionally in nature, when they are known as waterspouts, but nobody 
has managed to recreate one on this scale by man-made means.

The Arts Council yesterday rejected accusations that it was a waste of money.

Arts Council England executive director 
Laura Dyer said she was ‘disappointed’ that the artwork was scrapped but
there was always a risk in commissioning ground-breaking artworks.

She added: ‘What became clear was that it just couldn't be done within the budget or the timescale. I think there comes a point where you have to say we really tried, we worked hard to realise it, but it can't be done.

‘It is a project that was visionary and testing new technical equipment. In the end it wasn't able to deliver the vision of the artist.’

The project was originally announced in 2009, when Arts Councils across the UK commissioned 12 works to coincide with the London 2012 Olympics.

The other 11 Artists Taking the Lead commissions - ranging from a set of three crocheted lions in the East Midlands to a new football pitch created in a forest in the Scottish Borders - were all a success.

Ms Dyer stressed that most of the money spent on Column had gone into the local economy.

Anthony McCall, born in 1946, studied graphic design in Bromley, Kent, in the late 1960s before moving to America. There he began experimenting with light and cinema techniques but withdrew from creating art for 20 years until he restarted his 'solid light' series - using digital projections rather than 16mm film.

She added: ‘The investment has been into the region. The final project, in all its magnificence, hasn't been realised, but it absolutely is not a waste of money.’

British-born and New York-based Mr McCall is known for using mist, light and projection to create ethereal ‘sculptures’ in mid-air.

He said: ‘It is with profound disappointment that we have decided to draw our project to a close.

‘My team has worked long and hard but, due to the many regulatory and technical challenges, we have not been able to bring Column to completion.’
