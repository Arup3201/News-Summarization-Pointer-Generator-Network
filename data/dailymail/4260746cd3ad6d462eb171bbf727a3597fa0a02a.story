Firefighters face trauma every day, but for Mike Heim this was particularly heartbreaking.

The volunteer officer of 15 years responded to a call at the end of his shift on Friday - only to discover it was his own house in Lusby, Maryland.

He was part of the team battling the blaze which burned his home to the ground.

All he has left is a Bible, a friend's photo album, an antique fire nozzle, and a torched tin of coffee.

Fighting with them: Heim stayed with the crew battling the blaze as his home gradually burned to the ground

In shock: Heim said he broke down at the scene as he realized the flames could not be stopped

The fire is believed to have started due to an electrical fault in the master bedroom.

It was reported by a neighbor at 5.36am on Friday. 

Despite trying to hold it together, Heim describes how he broke down at the scene. 

'I was trying to get my wits about me to understand what was going on as I walked there,' he told Fox 5 News. 

'When I got to the house I noticed that it was fully engulfed.

'I tried to back up my firefighters friends and I just... I couldn't take it any more.' 

On Sunday, a team helped him sift through the rubble in a desperate bid to salvage any other possessions.

'There is nothing': Heim has searched through the rubble with a team of fellow officers but has found nothing

All he has left: Heim is left with a Bible, a singed carton of coffee, a fire nozzle, and a friend's photo album

'I had the department helping me out trying to scrounge through nothing to find something. There is nothing.

'So now I'm trying to put my life back together which is hard because there is nothing, I can't live off the little that I have.'

Heim has been given a place to stay in the fire station and a fund has been set up to help him rebuild his life.

Still reporting to duty: The next day, Heim reported to work and responded to a call as per usual 

Meanwhile, he is reporting to duty as normal.

Head of the station Norm Rea, who has worked with Heim for eight years, told Fox: 'It's very hard for us to say anything because you can't imagine what he's going through.

'During the fire one of our firefighters looked at me and said "Norm, it's Mike's house, I don't know what to say."

'All I can say is be there for him, he needs family support right now.'
