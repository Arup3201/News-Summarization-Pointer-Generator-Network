Up to a foot of snow will fall over the weekend as a blast of Arctic air creates treacherous conditions across the country.

Forecasters expect up to four inches of snow to fall in parts of Britain from today until Monday as temperatures in the countryside drop to a finger-numbing minus 8C (18F).

And the Met Office has issued several ‘yellow’ warnings nationwide for ice and snow over the weekend.

Cold snap: High pressure over Scandinavia and the UK has blocked off the milder weather and town hall chiefs are bracing themselves for a fortnight of ice and snow

Monday has been marked out as a ‘snow day’ by forecasters, with most of the country carpeted in at least an inch.

Higher ground across the Midlands, 
eastern England and Scotland could by then have received its third 
successive coating of four inches of snow.

In London, forecasters predict minor 
‘flurries’ of snow across the weekend, but ‘at least’ an inch of snow is
expected to fall on the capital late on Monday night, when freezing 
temperatures mean it is expected to settle.

This morning a blanket of thick fog settled over the City, looking like a harbinger of the unforgiving weather to come.

The only area likely to escape snow is the South West, although it is expected to be icy there.

Councils across the country have warned that many residential roads will not be gritted or cleared.

The Local Government Association said 
councils were ‘as prepared as ever’ and insisted there would not be a 
repeat of the big freeze of 2010, when large parts of the transport 
network ground to a halt.

But it admitted council gritters and snowploughs could not clear every street.

A spokesman said: ‘In the side roads 
which aren’t gritted by councils, drivers will need to be extra 
careful.’ The AA warned three-quarters of motorists were not ready for 
the weather this weekend – with those in London the least prepared.

It advised drivers to carry warm 
clothing and snacks in the car and to keep speeds down, especially on 
rural roads. The RAC said it is expecting up to 56,000 breakdowns and 
widespread disruption.

Councils are preparing themselves for the Big Freeze by loading grit onto lorries across the country

Train services could also face disruption, according to Network Rail.

It plans to run trains through the 
night to stop tracks from freezing over and treat electric rails with 
anti-freeze.

Meanwhile, Manchester Airport said it was ‘on alert for 
snow’ and Gatwick Airport said there was ‘a possibility’ of disruption 
on Monday, depending on the levels of snowfall.

Heathrow said it did not expect to have to cancel any flights over the weekend.

In December, less than an inch of snow caused five airports, including Stansted and Luton, to close.

And three inches of snow led Heathrow Airport to cancel half its flights last February.

Met Office forecaster Charles Powell 
said: ‘There could be some disruption to travel, especially on Monday 
when more widespread snow is forecast.’

Looking ahead, John Lee, a Meteogroup 
forecaster, said: ‘It will stay cold into next week, with temperatures 
quite widely not getting above 4C (39F) during the day.’
