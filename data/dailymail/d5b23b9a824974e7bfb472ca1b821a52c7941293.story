When Bob Priddle took early retirement from his job in publishing, he and wife Sara planned to buy a guesthouse in Cornwall to provide them with some income.

Instead they ended up purchasing a 16th Century cottage, mill and a museum crammed with 5,000 artefacts – from Bronze Age farm implements to an early Morphy Richards iron.

‘When we saw that it was for sale we weren’t that interested but we thought that a trip to see it would make a nice day out,’ recalls Bob, 62. ‘After walking around the house and museum, we looked at each other and said, “Wow”. We told the owner we’d buy it.’

Flour power: Bob and Sara Priddle are selling The Wayside Museum and the Trewey Mill in Zennor in West Cornwall as a working, live-in, museum

The couple paid £375,000 for Wayside Museum, Fewey Mill and Bridge House in 2002 and although they then had little knowledge of ancient history, the flour business or the tourist trade, they soon became accomplished curators who can describe in detail every artefact from a 5,000-year-old grinding stone to a Fifties washing machine. Bob has even restored the mill to produce organic flour.

The business is in the pretty coastal village of Zennor, near St Ives. Currently, it brings in about £60,000 a year but the couple, who are now retiring and selling up, believe it could produce far more.

They point out that the museum, for which they charge a £3.75 entrance fee, could be kept open for more months of the year, the mill could be run harder and their four-bedroom cottage could be converted into a holiday let. ‘It’s a lovely business,’ says Bob. ‘We’ve deliberately kept sales below the VAT threshold of £73,000 but there’s huge potential.’

The museum, which has sections dedicated to farming, mining and shoemaking, is closed in winter and rarely opens on Saturdays during summer months.

‘At the moment we mill about half a ton of flour a month in the summer and sell it to six shops but we could easily sell to 60,’ says Sara, 55, a former magazine  editor. ‘If we were staying I’d also like to convert the gift shop into a bakery.’

Artifacts: The Wayside Museum which celebrates farming, mining and homemaking, was opened in 1937 and has 5,000 items on display

Back in 2002, the house needed extensive repairs, which cost £60,000. ‘The previous owner had poured concrete down the chimney to block it and it took three weeks to dig it out. There was a lot of other structural work – we had new doors made, laid a stone floor in the kitchen and put in new central heating and a sewage treatment plant,’ says Bob. He seems most proud of the watermill, which was restored in 2009. The couple started milling the following year.

The museum was started in 1937 by a former colonel in the Indian Army with a special interest in primitive farming methods, and it has a great reputation, drawing in people from around the globe. ‘Our oldest pieces are grinding querns from about 3,000BC – there are three in the British Museum, but we’ve got 12,’ says Sara. ‘However, the most talked-about piece is a Fifties Hotpoint Princess washing machine.’

The site attracts 10,000 visitors a year, including ironing enthusiasts, drawn not just to early charcoal models but also to a modern Morphy Richards. Yet one of the couple’s biggest tasks is turning pieces away. ‘People bring artefacts to us all the time but we just don’t have the space,’ says Bob.

Since the business went up for sale for £895,000, it has attracted interest from the National Trust. A spokesman says: ‘Wayside Museum and its regionally and nationally important collection must rank as one of the most outstanding potential archaeological acquisitions that we have considered for a long time.’

Unfortunately, the Trust does not have funds to buy it. Two other offers have since come in from people wanting to split and sell the collection, which the Priddles rejected. ‘We don’t have a legal obligation to run the museum but we do have a personal one. And if we did decide to put everything on eBay, the villagers would lynch us,’ jokes Sara.

The property sits in a delightful village. Zennor, famed for a legend about a mermaid who is said to have swum up a local river and appeared in the village church, is a ten-minute walk from the sea.

When the Priddles do find a buyer, they won’t be going far. ‘When we came here from Exeter, our eldest two children were finishing university and only our youngest, Katie, who was about to start a degree  at University College London, came with us,’ says Bob.

‘She later met and married the son of the farmer next door and she’s due to give birth to their third child in August, so we want to be near our grandchildren.’
