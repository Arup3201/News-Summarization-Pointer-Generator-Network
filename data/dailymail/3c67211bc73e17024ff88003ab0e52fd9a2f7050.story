An emaciated puppy that was dumped in the snow and tied to a gate has finally recovered after her cruel ordeal.

Twinkle was discovered tied to the gates of Battersea Dogs & Cats Home in the snow in February, after a man left her there.

Heart breaking CCTV footage of the six to 12-month-old Lurcher being tied to the gates of Battersea’s Brands Hatch centre on a freezing cold February night and left all alone in the snow.

She has now made a full recovery after being found tied to the gate in the snow on a February night

Twinkle was so weak that she had collapsed and was carried into a kennel where she was given warm bedding, food and water.

Because Twinkle was so severely emaciated, she required urgent medical attention and was moved to Battersea’s London clinic where she was given around the clock care. 

Shaun Opperman, the Head Veterinary Surgeon at Battersea who has treated animals at the Home for more than 20 years, was aghast at Twinkle's condition.

He said: 'We see lots of underweight dogs coming into our care, but Twinkle is one of the most severe cases of neglect we have seen here.

'She was very weak when she came to us but she made a remarkable recovery.'

The dog's abandonment was captured on CCTV footage before a security guard found her

Presenter Paul O’Grady, who met Twinkle while he was filming for ITV series 'Paul O'Grady: For The Love Of Dogs' was particularly moved by her story.

He said: 'I’ve never seen anything like it. She was in a dreadful state and as thin as a credit card. She was left tied to an electric gate, on the coldest night possible.

'The security guard had the good sense to turn the gates off and open them manually because if he’d opened them with the button they’d have crushed her to death.

'She's lovely, such a sweetheart. What you find with these abused dogs is they are so friendly, after what humans have done to them you’d think they’d shy away but they don’t. It breaks your heart.'

During her stay, Twinkle was fostered by one of Battersea¿s vet nurses who helped her on the road to recovery until she was ready to find a new home

During the two months Twinkle was at Battersea she went from strength to strength, and was fostered by one of Battersea’s vet nurses who helped her on the road to recovery until she was ready to find a new home.

Richard King, Centre Manager at Battersea Brands Hatch adds: 'It saddens me to see dogs like Twinkle and I struggle to comprehend what this dog could have possibly done that caused someone to inflict such cruelty and neglect.

'I will never forget the first time I met her – her eyes were so full of life and even though she was weak and tired, she still managed to wag her tail when I knelt down beside her.

'Thankfully she’s made a remarkable recovery.'
