Viral sensation: Beejoli Shah's email, which included an attached image showing photo booth snaps of her and Quentin Tarantino, has gone viral

But MailOnline can reveal that the 23-year-old is a University of California Berkeley politics graduate working for a television production company in Santa Monica.

The former Berkeley student was an anchor on her college television station and appeared as a contestant on game show Wheel of Fortune.

Miss Shah also worked for former Democratic Party senate candidate Joe Alioto Veronese in his 2008 campaign.

In the email, which has gone viral, Miss Shah told how she met Mr Tarantino, 48, at a party in 'The Hills' before they went back to his house where she claims he sucked her toes.

'I'm making a drink and realize the pasty tall fellow pouring orange juice into my glass is the man himself, QT,' she wrote.

'Realizing I kind of have to go for at it this point, in all my nerd glory blurt out: "I'm sure everyone tells you this but I f**king loved Reservoir Dogs.'

Director: The email claims that Quentin Tarantino, 48, sucked the 23-year-old's toes while he performed a sex act

She claims that the pair kissed in a kitchen at the party after she told him that she did not like his Kill Bill films.

According to the email, Mr Tarantino said: 'Wow...I don't think anyone has said that to my face about my seminal films.'

She replied: 'Perhaps it's because you call them your seminal films. Shouldn't you wait for someone else to say that?'

Before he said, 'You know, you've got a mouth on you. I like that,' and the Oscar-winning film director put his arm around her and kissed her.

'At some point in our public makeout, Jamie Foxx comes over and without acknowledging me goes, "Yo QT, ready to roll?" Quentin looks at me and says "Want to come to my house?",' Miss Shah wrote in the email.

The couple went back to the director's house where they took pictures of themselves in a photo booth, which Miss Shah attached to the email as 'proof that this story even happened'.

Miss Shah said that she 'started panicking' when Mr Tarantino suggested they head to bed because 'the makeouts were really losing their appeal because you can only be sweated on so much'.

She then included a graphic description of his private parts and claims that Mr Tarantino asked if he could suck her toes while he masturbated.

'And thus began the weirdest ten 
minutes of my life - having my feet made out with by an Oscar winning 
filmmaker while he pleasured himself,' she wrote.

'In the morning, I snooped through Quentin's belongings while he was in the bathroom and now know his e-mail address,' she added.

'He fooled around with my feet one more time (this time without asking, which I found rude), and then drove me back.

'Most insane experience of my life, and without a doubt, probably the best story I will ever get to tell.'

She added: 'I've
 attached our photo booth photos for those of you who think I still just
 have a vivid imagination...and yes, he does look like Frankenstein.'

According
 to Miss Shah's resume, she has worked at television production company 
and talent agency Generate in Santa Monica since January.

She previously worked as an assistant at APA Talent and Literary Agency since graduating from University of California Berkeley in 2008 with a degree in political science.
