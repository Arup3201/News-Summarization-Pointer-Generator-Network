A fire that ripped through one of Russia's largest public libraries has been likened to a cultural 'Chernobyl'. 

The blaze began late on Friday at the Institute of Scientific Information on Social Sciences in Moscow, which was created in 1918 and holds more than 14 million items. 

It also contains documents from the League of Nations, UNESCO, and early parliamentary reports dating back as far as 1789.

A fire ripped through the Institute of Scientific Information on Social Sciences in Moscow late on Friday 

The library in Moscow contains one of the world's richest collections of Slavic language works in Russia

The fire continued to burn throughout Saturday despite 200 firefighters' efforts to douse the blaze

Vladimir Fortov, president of the Russian Academy of Sciences, said: 'It's a major loss for science. This is the largest collection of its kind in the world, probably equivalent to the [US] Library of Congress. 

'One can find documents there that are impossible to find elsewhere, all the social sciences use this library. What has happened here is reminiscent of Chernobyl,' he said, referring to the 1986 nuclear catastrophe. 

He said about 15 per cent of the collection had been damaged at the library, which includes one of the world's richest collections of Slavic language works, as well as documents from Britain, Italy and the US. 

He added that much of the damage was caused by water from the firefighting operations.  

The institute's director Yuri Pivovarov said firefighters had done 'everything possible' to save the texts.

No one was injured in the fire, which broke out on Friday evening on the library's second floor and continued burning throughout Saturday despite 200 firefighters' efforts to douse the blaze. 

The cause of the blaze is unclear, but according to Russia media investigations suspect an electrical short-circuit was to blame.
