As well as being home to 25,000 displaced Syrians and dozens of aid workers, the squalid Atmeh refugee camp - where Briton David Haines was captured by militants in March last year - is located just one mile from an ISIS stronghold full of swaggering UK jihadists who lived in a hilltop villa.

Temporary canvas tents line the so-called Olive Tree camp's tracks, but the residents  dared not dream of going back to their home towns - and certainly wouldn't risk visiting nearby Atmeh village.

Their lives and those of the aid workers such as Haines were in stark contrast to the self-described 'goodly' existence of ISIS militants are living in Atmeh - who posed for boastful photographs with expensive vehicles, swimming in luxury pools and relaxing in a huge mansion overlooking the camp.

While the swaggering militants enjoy 'five star jihad' living like medieval lords in their hilltop fort, the terrified refugees below were forced to suffer regular raids on their rundown camp.

It appears to have been on one of these missions that Haines was kidnapped along with three other men while working for an aid company MailOnline can now reveal to be the French Charity ACTED.

ISIS militants are known to have started massing in Atmeh late last year - around the time Al Qaeda condemned the group's barbarism, and a few months after Haines was kidnapped from the camp.

Before this other Islamist militant groups were active in the area - among them the feared Nusra Front, who are believed to have originally kidnapped slain U.S. journalist James Foley before militants defecting to ISIS eventually took him with them.

As if so-often the case with tech-savvy, Western-raised militants, many of the young ISIS fighters opted to document every aspect of life in their new stronghold is a series of social media posts.

In stark contradiction to the hardships of the refugee camp below, a group of militants appear to have lived in a large hilltop mansion in Atmeh - posting images of themselves posing with expensive cars, swimming in luxury pools and keeping fit at an outdoor gym.

The hub of their operations in Atmeh, however, seems to have been the village's internet cafe, where the men photographed themselves browsing on the internet while wielding guns in a room decorated with black and white jihadist flags.

When two of the British militants, Choukri Ellekhlifi, 22, and Mohammed el-Araj, 23, were killed in clashes, a third fighter paid tribute to them Facebook, saying: 'This brother [el-Araj] need no introduction. Those who knew him knew he was always working for his deen [religious path].'

Revealing the training the group had, the militant added: 'He had the best manners, he came with a brother and left this world with the brother! They where tight and where both at the top of their classes and within a month where graduated as commandos and started teaching others.'

As Haines 
was kidnapped by Islamist militants in Atmeh refugee camp early in 2013,
 there is nothing to suggest this particular band of ISIS loyalists 
active in Atmeh later in the year had anything to do with his 
disappearance, and exact details of who carried out the kidnapping 
remain sketchy.

It is also unclear whether the group are still active in Atmeh, which falls outside official estimates of territory under ISIS control - although these maps tend to ignore isolated pockets the group operates within, particularly in western Syria where villages are regularly taken and lost.

Despite the dangers posed by jihadists
 of all persuasion on its doorstep in 2013, the Olive Tree camp 
attracted a number Westerners eager to raise 
awareness of the refugees' desperate situation.

Among
 them was Steven Sotloff - the American journalist brutally beheaded by 
an ISIS militant earlier this week in a sickening video that made public
 the fact the group also held Haines.

In
 January 2013 - just two months' before Haines' capture - Sotloff wrote a
 harrowing dispatch from Atmeh, in which he detailed the despair of 
families with so little to eat that they willingly sold blankets 
protecting them from the harsh Syrian winter in order to buy bread for 
their malnourished children.

The extremist group now presides over a mass of land equivalent to the size of the UK, from Aleppo to central Iraq, and controls at least four million people. Atmeh is close to the border with Turkey

Known
 as the Olive Tree Camp, Atmeh was set up in 2011 by Texas-based Maram 
Foundation after a group of its employees stumbled across dozens of 
locals sitting among the olive tress that hug Syria's barbed-wire border
 fence with Turkey.

The 
refugees had fled their homes as the Syrian conflict intensified, but 
their hope of being allowed to seek refuge in Turkey was in vain and so 
they were left with nowhere to go and very little to eat.

Over
 the next two years, the number of people living in the camp grew 
steadily as Maram Foundation were joined by groups such as Aid For All 
and Caravan of Mercy in providing food and medical aid.

The growth of ISIS in the area isolated the locals still further - and among the images uploaded to social media by the militants were photographs of them practicing shooting in the very olive groves that gave the camp its name.

Vast numbers of British jihadists have
 arrived in Syria via Turkey's popular Antalya airport, where they pose 
as tourists before slipping off along countryside roads leading to the 
war-torn country.

In one 
unverified image uploaded by an Atmeh-based militant last year, the 
border between Turkey and the camp in Syria is shown as little more than
 a seemingly unguarded barbed-wired fence.

He captioned the image: 'Now how easy does that look?'

God

For
 many would-be militants the first stop along the way is the village of 
Atmeh, which is believed to have become an ISIS stronghold due to the sheer number of Western fighters arriving via Turkey.

The town's police station was painted in the distinctive black and white of ISIS' flag - a symbolic reminder that for them, law and order is a religious concept, not a man-made one. 

The ISIS militants and the various faction that came before them also carry out regular raids in the Atmeh camp.

Officially at least it is protected by rebels from the Free Syrian Army, but as the population swelled the defence force has often proved incapable of stopping unwanted elements getting in - including jihadists, forces loyal to Syrian president Bashar Assad, and opportunist militia factions sent by local tribal leaders.

When Sotloff wrote his dispatch for Foreign Policy during the bitter Levantine winter last January, the full terrifying force of ISIS had yet to properly arrive in Atmeh.

Within just a few months, even the trees inside the camp were not safe from militants. 

Last November a 150-year-old tree was cut down by a masked militant wielding a chainsaw after it was deemed the residents of Atmeh spent more time venerating it than they did praising God.
