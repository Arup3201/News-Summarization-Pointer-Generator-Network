Police today continued to scour the banks of a canal for signs of missing schoolgirl Alice Gross, who vanished in west London 11 days ago.

Officers were seen patrolling the banks of a waterway in Hanwell, west London, near where 14-year-old Alice lived.

Yesterday a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder - the second arrest in connection with her disappearance.

It came as it emerged officers are also looking into the girl's social media profiles, including a website at the centre of bullying claims.

Divers: Police specialists searched under the water of the Grand Union Canal, near where Alice Gross went missing

Appeal: Police and Alice's parents have begged for information on the missing girl's location

Investigation: It emerged last night that officers are looking at the online profiles of the trouble teenager

Another man, 25, arrested on suspicion of murder on Saturday, also remained in custody. Both were being held at a west London police station. 

The Metropolitan Police said the two arrests were 'independent' of each other. The force tweeted: ‘Despite two arrests following Alice Gross disappearance, all lines of enquiry still open & this remains a missing person investigation.' 

As divers yesterday continued to search the waterway, officers looked at the online profile of the troubled teenager, who had dropped to about six stone as she battled anorexia. 

Of particular interest is the Latvia-based chat room Ask.fm, where Alice responded to hundreds of questions from other anonymous users.

The website has been heavily criticised for its lack of regulation and cyberbullying and linked to the suicides of at least 12 young people – including Izzy Dix, 14, who hanged herself after suffering months of abuse.

Many of the questions faced by Alice were deeply personal, including potential boyfriends, sex, weight and her appearance.

Asked what she would 'change about herself', she replies in a video filmed in her bedroom: 'Everything'.

'Maybe I would keep my eyes because I like the colour of my eyes but that is it,' she said. 'I hate everything else, really hate everything else about me. I would change everything, I'm so ugly.'

Police have seized the talented singer's computer from her home to examine her prolific use of sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Skype and the messaging application Kik. 

There are numerous 'selfie' photos showing how painfully thin Alice has become. One picture of her almost concave stomach in February prompted a series of questions on Ask.fm, which has more than 70 million users.

Last sighting: Alice was last seen walking along a canal towpath near her west London home 11 days ago. Above, a CCTV camera captured images of the teenager walking along the towpath near Brentford Lock

Missing: Asked on Ask.fm what she would 'change about herself', Alice (pictured above) replied: 'Everything'

To the query 'How long did it take you to a get a flat stomach?' Alice replied: 'I still don't have one yet.' 

Last year the mother of Izzy Dix called for Ask.fm to be closed down after the teenager suffered vile taunts, insults and cruel remarks. 

Hannah Smith, 14, also took her own life after enduring months of bullying on the website. 

Following an outcry Ask.fm announced measures including a higher-profile button for reporting bullying and a pledge to respond within 24 hours.

It also vowed to set up a separate website for parents to find out more about Ask.fm and hire more site moderators. No-one from the firm was available to comment last night. 

Divers are today due to resume their search of a half-mile stretch of the Grand Union Canal in Ealing, west London.

Two police dinghies could yesterday be seen on the waters as dog handlers searched undergrowth and were seen at her £850,000 home in Hanwell, less than a mile away. 

Family: The teenager's mother, teacher Rosalind Hodgkiss, 50, said Alice may have been going on long walks by herself. Above, Ms Hodgkiss is pictured with Alice's father Jose Gross (left) and sister Nina Gross (right)

Alice was last seen on August 28. A CCTV camera captured images of the teenager near Brentford Lock and police are now appealing for five cyclists who pass her in the footage to get in touch.

Her mother, teacher Rosalind Hodgkiss, 50, said Alice may have been going on long walks by herself.

'What I would want to say is whatever she feels, or might have happened, we are not angry with her,' she said.
