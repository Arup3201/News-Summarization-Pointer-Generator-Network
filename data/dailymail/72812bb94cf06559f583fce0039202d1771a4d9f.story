Rising populations are driving Earth towards a 'tipping point' where species we depend on die out, says a committee of 22 scientists - hitting industries such as fishing, agriculture, forestry and water.

Some areas of the planet may already be so overpopulated as to be beyond hope - and once the planet is more than 50% under tarmac and agriculture, the results could be global disaster.

When smaller areas hit levels above 50%, the results are disastrous. If the entire planet hits this 'tipping point', the effects would be impossible for scientists to predict.

Rising populations are driving Earth towards a 'tipping point' where species we depend on die out, says a committee of 22 scientists - hitting industries such as fishing, agriculture, forestry and water

The committee calls for 'global leadership' to prevent such a disaster - but warns ome areas of the planet may already be so overpopulated as to be beyond hope.

If the entire planet hits a 'tipping point', the results will be impossible for scientists to predict - and the committee calls for 'global leadership' to prevent such a disaster.

Professor Anthony Barnosky, the lead 
author from the University of California, Berkeley, warns: ‘It really 
will be a new world, biologically, at that point.

‘The data suggests that there will be a 
reduction in biodiversity and severe impacts on much of what we depend 
on to sustain our quality of life, including, for example, fisheries, 
agriculture, forest products and clean water. This could happen within 
just a few generations.’

Studies of small-scale ecosystems have 
shown that once 50-90 percent of an area has been altered, the entire 
ecosystem tips irreversibly into a state far different from the 
original, in terms of the mix of plant and animal species and their 
interactions and usually resulting in species extinctions and a loss of 
biodiversity.

Currently with 7 billion people about 43
percent of Earth's land surface has been converted to agricultural or 
urban use and with a predicted rise to 9 billion by 2045 it is estimated
that half will be disturbed by 2025.

‘Can it really happen? Looking into the 
past tells us unequivocally that, yes, it can really happen. It has 
happened. The last glacial/interglacial transition 11,700 years ago was 
an example of that,’ Professor Barnosky said.

‘I think that if we want to avoid the most unpleasant surprises, we want to stay away from that 50 percent mark.’

Population density is rising, as seen from this night view of Earth: If the entire planet hits this 'tipping point', the results will be impossible for scientists to predict - and the committee calls for 'global leadership' to prevent such a disaster.

The paper, by 22 internationally 
renowned scientists, calls for better predictive models based on a 
detailed understanding of how the biosphere reacted in the distant past 
to rapidly changing conditions - including climate and human population 
growth.

UC have begun a £2.6 million research 
project to develop reliable, detailed biological forecasts, to 
understand how plants and animals responded to major shifts.

The authors of the review - biologists, 
ecologists, complex-systems theoreticians, geologists and 
paleontologists from the United States, Canada, South America and Europe
- argue that, although warning signs are emerging, no one knows how 
close Earth is to a global tipping point.

Professor Barnosky said: ‘We really do 
have to be thinking about these global scale tipping points, because 
even the parts of Earth we are not messing with directly could be prone 
to some very major changes.

‘And the root cause, ultimately, is human population growth and how many resources each one of us uses.’

Co-author Elizabeth Hadly from Stanford 
University said: ‘We may already be past these tipping points in 
particular regions of the world. I just returned from a trip to the high
Himalayas in Nepal, where I witnessed families fighting each other with
machetes for wood - wood that they would burn to cook their food in one
evening.

‘In places where governments are lacking
basic infrastructure, people fend for themselves, and biodiversity 
suffers. We desperately need global leadership for planet Earth.’

They urge global cooperation to reduce 
population growth and per-capita resource use, to replace fossil fuels 
with sustainable sources, develop more efficient food production and 
distribution, and management of land and oceans not already dominated by
humans as reservoirs of biodiversity and ecosystem services.

‘Ideally, we want to be able to predict 
what could be detrimental biological change in time to steer the boat to
where we don't get to those points,’ Professor Barnosky said.

‘My underlying philosophy is that we 
want to keep Earth, our life support system, at least as healthy as it 
is today, in terms of supporting humanity, and forecast when we are 
going in directions that would reduce our quality of life so that we can
avoid that.’

‘My view is that humanity is at a crossroads now, where we have to make an active choice.

‘One choice is to acknowledge these 
issues and potential consequences and try to guide the future (in a way 
we want to). The other choice is just to throw up our hands and say, 
'Let's just go on as usual and see what happens.' My guess is, if we 
take that latter choice, yes, humanity is going to survive, but we are 
going to see some effects that will seriously degrade the quality of 
life for our children and grandchildren.’
Climate change, population pressure and widespread destruction of natural ecosystems may be driving toward an irreversible change in biosphere with devastating consequences, the prestigious group of researchers say.

In just a few generations our food and water supplies could be gravely effected with some plant and animal species being wiped out completely. But we can prepare ourselves by learning lessons from what happened in the past, it is said.

The review paper, which will be published tomorrow in the journal Nature, compares the biological impact of past incidences of global change with processes under way today and assess evidence for what the future holds.

The results could cause some plant and animal species to disappear, new mixes of remaining species, and major disruptions to crops - leading to global political instability, it is claimed.
