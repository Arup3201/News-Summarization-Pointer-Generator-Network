Actress Joanna Lumley yesterday urged Nepal to ban a ‘festival of slaughter’ in which up to 250,000 terrified animals are killed.

They are held in a giant open-air pen where their heads are hacked off in full view of each other. The victims include buffalo, goats, chickens and pigs. Some have their legs severed before they are decapitated.

The festival is held every five years to honour Hindu goddess Gadhimai and takes place at the end of November. 

Appalled: Actress Joanna Lumley yesterday urged Nepal to ban a ‘festival of slaughter’ in which up to 250,000 terrified animals are killed

Millions cross the border from India to circumvent laws against animal sacrifice in their own country.

The Nepalese government donated more than £36,000 towards the last Gadhimai festival in 2009, but now campaigners from Compassion in World Farming say the mass killing is opposed by the global Hindu community and that there is no religious justification for it.

At a rally outside the Nepalese Embassy in London yesterday, Ms Lumley said: ‘This inhumane event is not part of the mainstream Hindu faith. 

'It is little more than a bloodlust which allows people to revel in the gory deaths of thousands of terrified creatures.’

The slaughtered animals are taken to nearby villages and eaten in feasts. Devotees, pictured here during the last festival in 2009, believe eating them wards away evil

The star, who campaigned successfully for Nepalese Gurkha soldiers to be allowed to settle in Britain, said: ‘I love Nepal – both the land and its people. 

'The Gadhimai festival entails horrendous suffering and is a complete anomaly in this wonderful country.’

Surya Upadhya, chairman of the Nepalese Hindu Forum in the UK, said: ‘There should not be any place for this barbaric sacrifice of innocent animals in the name of any religion.’
