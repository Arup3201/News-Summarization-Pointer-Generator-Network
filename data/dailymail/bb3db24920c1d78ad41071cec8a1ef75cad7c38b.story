We can only assume at the end of this ferocious East Midlands derby that were Brian Clough looking down a decade after his death, a wicked smile might have spread across his lips.

The two clubs to which he brought unequalled glory clattered into one another for 98 minutes — such was the length of added time — and produced a match that made up in drama what it lacked in quality.

Old Big ’Ead might also have been able to smack some sense into the pitch invader who managed to delay the match for an inordinate period and stoke even further an atmosphere Stuart Pearce called the ‘best ever in this stadium’.

In the second half a Forest fan left his seat to stroll around the City Ground, goad the Derby fans and swing his shirt round his head, only being caught as he returned to the stands. Expert policing, this was not. Shortly after the interruption, Forest took the lead in the 71st minute. Michail Antonio, a menace down the left, fed Britt Assombalonga, who turned adroitly to fire a crisp left-foot shot past Lee Grant and send the City Ground into raptures.

It was the striker’s fifth goal since his move from Peterborough and his £5.5million fee is looking a bargain.

Steve McClaren reorganised his Derby side and in the 80th minute they equalised after a goalmouth scramble that should see Ryan Shotton, on his league debut for the club, credited with the goal ahead of Leon Best.

Richard Keogh headed Craig Forsyth’s free-kick against the bar, Shotton met the rebound and the ball crossed the line before Best rammed it into the back of the net, even if referee Paul Tierney failed to blow initially.

In the closing minutes Jake Buxton was given a second yellow card for a foolish challenge on Chris Burke. This match never looked like ending 11 v 11 and it was the sixth red card in the last eight meetings between these rivals. Forest stay unbeaten at the top of the Championship, with Derby yet to find the form that took them to the play-off final last May. ‘It was probably a fair result,’ reflected Pearce. ‘I’m a little bit disappointed in the quality of some of the football. I don’t think we had enough devilment in our play.’

Pearce lost only one derby match during his 12 years as a Forest player and knows the edge this game carries. But he praised both sets of supporters for celebrating the memory of Clough with a minute’s applause in the 10th minute.

‘It’s great to see,’ he said. ‘There is one person who unites this part of the world and it is that man.’

More choice words were sent the way of the rogue Forest fan, who was allowed to walk on the pitch untroubled for at least three minutes. ‘It was pathetic,’ said Pearce. ‘I have no idea why stewards didn’t intervene.’

Pearce will today find out about the gravity of captain Chris Cohen’s injury. The midfielder left the field after twisting his right knee. He wore the pained expression of a player who has missed two substantial spells with cruciate ligament injuries in the past three seasons.

‘We just hope luck is on his side because I know the hard work he puts in behind the scenes,’ said Pearce.
