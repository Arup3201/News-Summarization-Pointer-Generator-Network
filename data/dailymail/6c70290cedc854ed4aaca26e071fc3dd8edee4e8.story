Ronny Deila revealed it was his ‘dream’ to march Celtic into the group stage of the Champions League as he became the club’s 18th manager on Friday.

The 38-year-old’s position was confirmed following talks with major shareholder Dermot Desmond and chief executive Peter Lawwell earlier this week.

Lawwell decribed Deila as a ‘good fit’ for the club’s transfer model after the Norwegian last season led unfashionable Stromsgodset to their first title in 43 years.  

But his first test comes within a matter of weeks as he attempts to lead the Scottish champions through the minefield of Champions League qualifying.

An upbeat Delia appeared ready for the
 challenge and said: ‘You can draw very good teams and you can be 
unfortunate — because it’s a cup and that’s hard.

‘But
 we need to have a good pre-season and take it from there. We know the 
quality and the hunger in the squad to get to the Champions League.  

‘When you get something, you want it even more next time. If we go out, then we go out and we have to work harder but I have a good feeling that we are going to succeed.

‘I am very proud today. It is a fantastic day for me. When I heard the name Celtic, I was interested right away. I felt in my stomach it was the right move.  

‘It is a fantastic step and I think it is the right step. I feel comfortable. I feel like this is like a family. It is my dream to take Celtic into Europe and be in the Champions League. I really enjoy European football.’

The
 pictures of Deila stripping to his underwear after leading Stromsgodset
 from the relegation mire have left the new man embarrassed. Indeed, he 
said Celtic will have to win the Champions League before he repeats the 
feat.  

‘I am not so happy about that,’ he grinned. ‘I hope I am more fit now than I was then.  

‘What
 can I say? It was a bet between the fans and me in 2009. We lost the 
old players because we didn’t have any money, so we had to play a young 
team.  

‘It was critical 
point in the season and I said on television that if we stay up, I will 
strip. We stayed up and the clothes went off but the pictures were not 
so good. I wish they had got a better angle.’  

Asked if there could be a repeat at Celtic, the new manager laughed: ‘We agreed that if we win the Champions League.’ 

Success: Deila coached Stromsgodset to their first Norwegian title in 43 years in 2013

Big job: Deila (left) will replace Neil Lennon at Celtic after the Northern Irishman quit

Deila,
 who has signed a 12-month rolling contract, confirmed former Celtic and
 Scotland midfielder John Collins is one of three candidates he is 
considering as his assistant.  

He
 is keen to employ a Scot with a knowledge of the local game and will 
also make the final call on Craig Gordon after the former Hearts and 
Sunderland keeper had a Parkhead medical on Tuesday.  

As
 Sportsmail first revealed, Deila had been considered by the Parkhead 
club as a potential replacement for Johan Mjallby as Neil Lennon’s No 2.
 However, the Northern Irishman’s departure created a bigger vacancy 
with Henrik Larsson, Roy Keane and Steve Clarke all interviewed for the 
post before Deila prevailed.  

Lennon confirmed yesterday that Deila had been earmarked to be his assistant before he quit a fortnight ago.

Backing: Predecessor Neil Lennon has backed Deila's credentials after he came highly recommended

The
 former Parkhead manager has expressed disappointment Roy Keane pulled 
out of the race, describing the Irishman as an ‘identikit’ Celtic 
manager.

But, offering his 
reaction to Deila’s appointment, Lennon said: ‘He was going to be 
brought in as No 2 when Johan Mjallby left. He came highly recommended -
 he’s highly thought of.

‘I 
know from contacts in the game that he is well respected as a coach. We 
recruited Stefan Johansen from Stromsgodset, so we were aware of his 
work.’

Addressing Lennon’s 
claim that Deila had shot from a possible assistant manager to the main 
man, Lawwell said at yesterday’s news conference: ‘Neil mentioned in an 
interview today that when Johan (Mjallby) left we had a chat about Ronny
 in terms of if he could play a role here.

‘When Neil decided to go and the process started two weeks ago, Ronny was at the top of the list to go and have a chat to.

‘There
 were no job offers (to other candidates). We spoke to a lot of people 
at different stages and got to different levels but no offer was made to
 anyone else.’
