A devoted couple have become Britain's oldest newlyweds, with a combined age of 180.

Lovestruck Charlie Winter, 91, and Daisy Pike, 89, met at a bus station in their hometown of South Molton in Devon nine years ago.

They were so smitten they missed their buses, deciding instead on an impromptu date at a fish and chip shop.

Charlie Winter, 91 and Daisy Pike, 89, are Britain's eldest couple to get married, with a combined age of 180.

Lovestruck Charlie Winter, 91, and Daisy Pike, 89, met at a bus station in their hometown of South Molton in Devon nine years ago.

War veteran Charlie has been nagging 
former nurse Daisy to be his wife ever since, though sheâ€™s refused to 
rush into marriage too early.

Until last December.

A
 fall left her in hospital, where doting Charlie sat by her bedside and 
popped the question once again. This time, she said yes.

The pair wed on Sunday at St Mary Magdalene Church in South Molton.

Daisy, still recovering from her fractured leg, used a walking stick to shuffle down the aisle before they exchanged vows sitting down.

Charlie Winter, 91, proposed to Daisy Pike, 89, last December and the couple married on Sunday 16 March

Charlie and Daisy have each been married twice before but have never had children.

They celebrated their nuptials with a reception for 60 guests at their local pub.

Daisy said: 'He'd asked me lots of times but there in the ward with all our friends around us I couldn't help but say yes.

'He said the words but was unable to get down on one knee because of his old age.

'He's always giving me flowers and paying me compliments - he's an old romantic.

'We're just in love and that's it. Madly in love to tell the truth. We love to go on walks and to the beach together.'

Daisy worked as a nurse at the North Devon Infirmary from 1960 until she retired in 1972.

Charlie was stationed in Burma during 
World War II and took part in the key battle of Kohima before returning 
to civilian life as a lorry driver.

He
 retired at 59 but says he didn't meet the love of his life until he 
arrived at Barnstaple bus station almost a decade ago and spotted Daisy.

And they say romance is dead! Britain's oldest newlyweds Daisy Pike, 89, and Charlie Winter, 91, say getting married is, 'about one word - love'

Charlie said: 'Daisy was wearing a lovely red coat, we were both having a cuppa when our eyes met across the canteen.

'We both missed our buses, went for fish and chips and got to know each other.

'I still call her my little red coat.'

The couple enjoy travelling and, over their nine years together, have holidayed in Portugal, the Netherlands, Weston-super-Mare, Blackpool, Snowdonia.

They are now planning a honeymoon in Bournemouth in June.

Romantic Charlie added: 'As far as I'm concerned getting married is about just one word - love.'
