The grieving mother of one of the 19 wildland 'hotshots' killed in north-central Arizona has filed a $36 million claim against authorities, saying their negligence led to the death of her firefighter son.

Marcia McKee, from Costa Mesa in California, filed a notice of claim on Friday accusing the state, Yavapai County and the city of Prescott of failing to follow proper firefighting procedures.

McKee's 21-year-old son, Grant McKee, died in the Yarnell Hill Fire on June 30.

McKee is seeking $12 million apiece from the state, Yavapai County and Prescott. But she said she'll settle for $12 million within the next 60 days.

In the claim, a precursor to a lawsuit, the single mom said she suffered tremendously when her 'best friend' and only son was taken away.

It is the first claim from a family member of the 19 fallen members of the Prescott-run crew.

'It's
not supposed to be like this,' the 49-year-old wrote. 'No more Mother's Day cards 
or phone calls. Nor will I ever get to see him walk down the aisle or be
called grandma. My life was also taken that day because he was my 
life.'

McKee, who works as a caretaker for an elderly person, recalled in her claim the last phone call she shared with her son in which she told him to be careful.

According to the claim, Grant told her: 'What are the odds of me dying in a fire? Think about it, Mom.'

Her attorney, Craig Knapp, wrote: 'The loss of his companionship, affection and love fully support the damages that she has requested in this notice of claim.'

An investigative report by a team of national experts released in September found proper procedure was followed in the worst firefighting tragedy since September 11, 2001.

The report, however, found communications lapses, including a 33-minute gap in radio traffic from the Hotshot crew in the hour before the men died. It did not determine if the tragedy was avoidable.

Knapp called the report a whitewash with a goal of avoiding blame.

He said any 'trusting, uninformed person reading the Yarnell Hill Fire report uncritically would think that the death of 19 men was just bad luck and no one's fault, which is false.'

Spokesmen for Prescott and Gov. Jan Brewer declined comment Friday.

Prescott Fire Chief Dan Fraijo claimed the 122-page report was a thorough analysis of the operations, training, equipment and firefighting protocols used that day.

He told The Arizona Republic he didn't know what McKee was trying to achieve with the claim.

'I don’t know what she’s trying to accomplish by it. Just on the surface - and, of course, this is just an opinion on my part - I can’t see this thing going anywhere,' he said.

McKee told The Arizona Republic she filed the claim to learn the truth about what happened in the fire.

'There
is no good answer right now,' McKee said. 'Nobody should have to go 
through this. No family should have to go through this. But it’s the 
only way to get answers.'

Devastating: Grant McKee was among 19 'hotshot' firefighters killed in the June 30 blaze at Yarnell, Arizona

Jack Fields, chief civil deputy Yavapai County attorney, said the county is reviewing the claim and would make appropriate decisions once that's done. He declined to comment further.

The claim names 13 entities or individuals, including Gov. Jan Brewer; Arizona State Forester Scott Hunt; Prescott Wildland Division Chief Darrell Willis, who oversaw the crew; Prescott Mayor Marlin Kuykendall; the Yavapai County Board of Supervisors; the state Department of Public Safety; and the Arizona Incident Management Team.

The governments could settle or allow the case to be resolved in court.

Grant McKee was training to be an emergency medical technician and had intended to work with the Granite Mountain Hotshots only for the summer. He was engaged to be married.
