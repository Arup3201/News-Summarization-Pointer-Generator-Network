Pepe has warned Real Madrid could come unstuck if they underestimate Cruz Azul in Tuesday's Club World Cup semi-final.

The European champions take on their CONCACAF counter-parts in Marrakech after the tie was moved from Rabat due to the poor state of the pitch.

Madrid are massive favourites for the competition, but defender Pepe insists Carlo Ancelotti's side can't afford to take anything for granted.

He told Marca: 'They're a talented and hard-working side. Some of their players have experience in La Liga and we'll have to prepare properly if we want to win the match. 

'Whoever wins the Club World Cup is the best club in the world and I'm hoping to capture the title to make the fans happy and end the year in style.

'I think that because of our history, Real are probably favourites and we have to recognise that, but we have to carry on showing the same humility as always if we want to be able to say that it's been a really positive year at the end of the tournament.

'We have to be completely professional. I think we're having a spectacular year and we have the ambition and attitude to reach the final and be worthy winners.'

Madrid trained in Rabat on Monday but heavy rain has left the pitch at the Prince Moulay Abdellah unplayable.

However, Pepe insists the Spanish side won't let the upheaval disrupt their preparations for the game. 

He added: 'We know that the venue has been changed. Ideally the pitch will be in the best possible condition to play good football.'
