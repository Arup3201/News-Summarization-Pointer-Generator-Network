Arsenal could be without a recognised left-back for Wednesday's clash against Southampton after Kieran Gibbs and Nacho Monreal sustained injuries on Saturday.

Gibbs (hip) and Monreal (knee) are doubts for the visit of Ronald Koeman's side and will be assessed at the club's London Colney HQ on Monday.

Wenger will be desperate for at least one of the left-backs to be fit as he looks to avoid yet another defensive selection headache.

Gunners left back Nacho Monreal is also struggling with a knee injury ahead of the Saints clash 

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain will be available to face Ronald Koeman's side after shaking off an ankle knock 

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has been passed fit for the clash against the Saints after taking a heavy kick on his ankle in the win over West Brom on Saturday, so too has Yaya Sanogo, who picked up a hamstring problem against Borussia Dortmund last week.

Arsene Wenger hopes first choice Wojciech Szczesny will be fit for Wednesday's clash after missing the last two games with a hip injury.

Wojciech Szczesny has not featured since sustaining a hip injury against Manchester Untied on November 22
