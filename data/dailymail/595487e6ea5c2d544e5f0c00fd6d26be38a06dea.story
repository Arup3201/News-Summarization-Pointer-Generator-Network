Controversial: Green Party member Mark Haworth-Booth, has boasted about his prowess with a gun alongside images of squirrels, rabbits and birds on his blog

A Green Party member who supports the RSPB has been branded a hypocrite after he went on a killing spree which included a bird, rabbits and squirrels.

Mark Haworth-Booth, who stood to be a councillor in North Devon, has been displaying the bodies of animals he shot in his garden on his personal blog.

Proudly, on the same page, he also says he supports the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Birds, despite admitting shooting dead a Jackdaw.

His blog entries shows on the same day in May 2011 he also shot a squirrel, and a month later killed two more.

He also killed, skinned and ate several rabbits.

And wildlife lovers say it’s not something they expect from a green campaigner.

Former North Devon Councillor Joanne Bell condemned Mr Haworth-Booth.

She said: 'Not only does Mark clearly enjoy taking his gun into his garden to shoot squirrels and birds but he actually takes pictures and posts them on his blog.

'He goes on to describe the dead animals in very poetic and flowery terms. He’s clearly proud of his prowess with the gun.'

Mr Haworth-Booth a former curator at 
the Victoria and Albert Museum from 1970 to 2004 and now an Honorary 
Research Fellow there, has defended his position.

He said: 'In deference to the sensitivities of some lovers of wildlife, I have removed my blog from the Internet,' he said.

'I think I’m right in saying Jackdaws considered a pest and grey squirrels are widely considered a menace to forestry.

'The Exmoor Society, of which I’m a member, sees the grey squirrel as public enemy number one.'

Mr Haworth-Booth didn’t think his actions were at odds with his image as an environmentalist.

'I think anyone who’s seriously interested in the countryside would share my view of the grey squirrel,' he said.

Questionable: A rabbit is left hanging by the legs in his garage after it was shot and killed

However, Mr Haworth-Booth did confess to feeling ashamed after shooting a jackdaw.

He said: 'I looked at it and it was a beautiful creature, but I had checked with the RSPB to see if it’s classified as a pest.'

Mr Haworth-Booth also dismissed Mrs Bell’s claims that he was proud of his marksmanship.

'That’s complete nonsense,' he said. 'If you’re going to kill a rabbit you want to be as good a shot as you can be.

'You don’t want the rabbit to crawl away wounded and in pain.'

He went on: 'As regards rabbits, I shot a small number for the table and one because it was dying a horrible death from myxomatosis. Although our household is mostly vegetarian, we do eat meat occasionally.

'A number of people feel that if you are prepared to eat meat you should be prepared to face up to the consequences.

'Thus I skinned and butchered the rabbits myself.  After shooting and eating six or eight rabbits over a two year period, myxomatosis returned and decimated the rabbit population. Now their numbers are building up again I’m glad to say, because I like seeing them in the garden. I have not shot any since the disease returned.'

The Green Party has today distanced itself from the case saying it 'does not support or condone the actions taken by Mark.

'There are non-lethal ways of removing so called pests and Mark fully intends to use these measures in future.  We understand that the rabbits were for the table bar one which was put out of its misery from myxomatosis,' a spokesman said.

Diana Lewis, founder of the North Devon Animal Ambulance, said as far as her organisation was concerned all creatures should be entitled to freedom and treated with compassion.

She said: 'Unfortunately if he’s doing it with the correct calibre rifle and no suffering is caused then he’s not doing anything illegal but personally I find it very sad.'

An RSPCA spokesman added: 'Wherever possible the RSPCA would always prefer alternative solutions and only if there is a serious problem and alternative means are ineffective or impractical should killing be contemplated.

'In this case control should be carried out legally, precisely targeted and carried out by the most humane method available in the circumstances.'
