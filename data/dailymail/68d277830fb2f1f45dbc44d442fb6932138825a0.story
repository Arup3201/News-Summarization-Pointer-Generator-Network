U.S. Army Sergeant John Russell is accused of shooting five fellow servicemen in Iraq

A U.S. Army sergeant accused of killing five fellow servicemen at a military counselling centre in Iraq has been ordered to undergo forensic hypnosis in a bid to unlock buried memories.

Sergeant John Russell, 48, has been deemed to have been suffering from post-traumatic distress disorder and was allegedly psychotic at the time of the shootings in 2009.

An Army judge has now ordered the hypnosis to see if it is possible to learn more about Russell's mental state during the shooting frenzy.

The military has claimed the incident may have been triggered by combat stress.

Russell, a member of the Army's 54th 
Engineer Battalion based in Bamberg, Germany, faces five charges of 
premeditated murder, one charge of aggravated assault and one charge of 
attempted murder in connection with the May 2009 shootings.

Two
of the dead were medical staff officers at a combat stress counselling 
clinic called Camp Liberty, part of the U.S. military's Victory Base 
Complex near the Baghdad airport. The other three were soldiers who 
happened to be at the centre at the time.

A
forensic psychiatrist who has since examined Russell suggested the 
sergeant was 'provoked to violence by the ineptitude and lack of 
compassion' he experienced from clinic staff when he sought treatment 
for depression several days before the shooting.

The
judge in the case, Army Colonel David Conn, cited the psychiatric 
opinion verbatim in his defence motions ruling, made public on Tuesday.

In
addition to assigning a Stanford University specialist to interview 
Russell under hypnosis, Conn ordered a sophisticated brain scan and 
battery of psychological tests for the sergeant.

Six months ago, Russell was ordered to stand trial in a military court at Joint Base Lewis-McChord near Tacoma, Washington. The court-martial could begin as early as March.

But his defence team is seeking to show that Russell was not in control of his actions and thus not criminally responsible.

During proceedings last month on his 
mental condition, a University of Pennsylvania forensic psychiatrist 
said he concluded that Russell was suffering from post-traumatic stress 
disorder and psychosis at the time of the shooting spree.

The
psychiatrist, Dr. Robert Sadoff, also said Russell suffered from 
'dissociative disorder,' or a lack of memory about the shootings.

Moreover,
Saddoff harshly criticized a psychologist and a psychiatrist on the 
staff at Camp Victory for what he called 'inexcusable treatment' of 
Russell days before the shooting.

'I have never seen a case such as this one where the defendant was provoked to violence by the ineptitude and lack of compassion of two of my colleagues, who were assigned to evaluate and treat Sergeant Russell while he was in an acute state of depression, with suicidal intent, while on active duty in Iraq,' Sadoff wrote in a submission quoted in Conn's ruling.

Russell's lawyer, James Culp, said his client had been 'abused' and belittled by the two officers, and that one had chased Russell out of the clinic while screaming at him. They were not the officers killed in the shooting rampage.

Culp told Reuters he hoped to prove that his client was legally insane at the time of the shootings.

'The defence and prosecution agree 
that Sergeant Russell was psychotic,' Culp said. 'The question is, "How 
psychotic was he?"' He added: 'Not one person in the military has ever 
been found not guilty by reason of insanity.'

The
case comes at a sensitive time for the Army, which is in the process of
deciding how to prosecute Staff Sergeant Robert Bales, a soldier 
accused of killing 16 Afghan villagers in cold blood earlier this year.

Culp
has said Russell was at a breaking point from the stress of multiple 
deployments, and suffered 'at least one traumatic experience involving 
civilian casualties' and 'mass grave sites' while serving in Bosnia and 
Kosovo.
