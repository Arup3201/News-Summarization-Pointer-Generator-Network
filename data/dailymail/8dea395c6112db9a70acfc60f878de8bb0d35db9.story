WBA and IBF super-middleweight champion Carl Froch has revealed he is close to agreeing a dream fight with Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr in Las Vegas.

Froch has sought a meeting with Chavez since stopping George Groves for the first time in November 2013 and is now confident promoter Eddie Hearn will deliver the fight.

It had been rumoured Froch would look to get his revenge on Andre Ward after his points defeat when the duo met in 2011, but the Nottingham fighter, 37, is only interested in a Box Office frenzy.

‘Professional boxing is a business first and foremost, let’s not forget that,’ said Froch. ‘People talk about Andre Ward, but I don’t want to fight him, he’ll probably beat me on points.

‘I’m a fighter and if I didn’t knock him out he’d beat me on points.

‘He’s not a big fight. American TV don’t want to show him on Box Office. So what’s the point?’

Froch hopes the Chavez fight will take place in March and insists plans beyond that will be dictated by his performance against the Mexican. ‘Dare I say it, but we’re nearly there with the Chavez fight in Las Vegas which we’ve long talked about,’ Froch added.

‘After knocking out Groves I was talking about the Chavez fight happening. It’s nearly there and I’m very optimistic that Eddie Hearn will make an announcement very soon.

‘This fight will take me to Las Vegas. Between beating Mikkel Kessler and speaking about Chavez, I’ve had the two epic fights with George Groves.

‘Last year was a great year for me. But definitely my next fight is in Vegas.’

'I've talked about retiring since I fought Lucian Bute when everybody though I was going to get beaten.

'I would have retired had I lost that fight, but since winning it I've gone from strength to strength.

'Here I am in 2015 talking about a dream fight in Vegas. Hopefully I'm getting that fight with March being talked about.

'If I beat Chavez on style and I feel great doing it, why would I retire at 37 years old? I'm not 47, I'm 37 and still feeling fresh and fit. As long as I can still do what I need to do physically, then I'll continue to box.

'It's one fight at a time, which is the way I've approached it for the last couple of years. Chavez next and then who knows?

'James DeGale is looking really good. I'm impressed with what he's doing. He's improved so much. That's a massive fight in Britain.'

Since losing to Andre Ward in December 2011, Froch has posted impressive wins against Bute, Yusaf Mack, Kessler and George Groves - his bitter domestic rival who failed to go beyond nine rounds in their two contests.

Ward is the division's undisputed number one but his career has stalled due to promotional issues and injuries that have rendered him inactive for the past 14 months, while the American's spoiling style also makes him a less attractive opponent.

Chavez, the 28-year-old former WBC middleweight champion and son of all-time great Julio Cesar Chavez, is a more aggressive fighter who has a record of 48 victories from 51 outings, although he has experienced weight and disciplinary problems in the past.

'It's an intriguing fight, because you can't say either myself of Chavez will win,' Froch said.

'I've improved since the Ward fight, had a great win over Kessler and almost found the second Groves fight easy - it wasn't hard work. When I'm producing that, why would people doubt me against Chavez?

'Chavez is a great fighter and in this weight division he'll be more comfortable. The fight carries its question marks - will he be good enough at super-middle? Have I still got what it takes to go 12 rounds because Chavez is very tough?'
