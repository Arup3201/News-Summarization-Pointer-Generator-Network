Unbeatable, unbreakable, perhaps even unstoppable. Whatever mix of mojo and moxie Hearts have working for them this season, it’s clearly effective. And maybe just a little bit supernatural.

Alim Ozturk’s stupendous strike to secure a dramatic late draw from Sunday's Edinburgh derby at Easter Road certainly looked to have a touch of the magical about it.

His 35-yard belt — into a two-club headwind, mind — dipped drastically to crash in off the underside of the bar at the last moment.

One of the best goals ever scored in this fixture, the unexpected injury-time intervention earned 10-man Hearts a reprieve from a game that Hibs should have won.

If that sounds like a familiar scenario to anyone with even a passing interest in this rivalry, the home side are absolved of any great blame for the loss of two points here.

Sure, they might have killed this game off when 1-0 up against a side reduced in numbers by Callum Paterson’s deserved red card. Ahead through a Dominique Malonga goal just before half-time, they created chances to bury Hearts.

But one of the great strengths of the visitors, who extended their unbeaten start to this season to 11 games, has been in finding a way — however unlikely — to take something when nothing appears likely.

On this occasion, a Dutch-born Turkish centre-half’s unstoppable thunderbolt from the stratosphere saw them move one point further clear at the top of the table. A side-effect of a moment that created absolute bedlam in the away end, as Hearts supporters — who had filled their allocation — revelled in the glory of another enjoyable derby day.

‘Time for Action. If Not Now, When?’ demanded the bill posters stuck to lamp posts the length of Easter Road by Hands On Hibs activists for this match day.

Although their cri de coeur is aimed at rallying supporters in protest against the club’s board, the words might easily have been applied to the position of the team.

Starting the day outside of the top four, a daunting 14 points adrift of the visiting leaders, Alan Stubbs’ men surely had to eke out more than just a draw from this second derby of the season. The comeback had to start here.

They certainly looked like the more adept footballing side from the outset, with midfielders Scott Allan and Scott Robertson excelling in a diamond formation.

They appeared to have enough guile to create openings, even if Malonga and Jason Cummings seemed determined to pass up chances to score.

Perhaps predictably on a day of gusting gales, the two best early chances came as a result of mistakes, Malonga flicking the ball wide after Danny Wilson had dawdled, then been robbed by Cummings, while Soufian El Hassnaoui shot straight at keeper Mark Oxley after Hibs defender Paul Hanlon had allowed the ball to bounce over his head.

Proceedings were predictably error-strewn, although Mogaro Gomis for Hearts and home midfielder Robertson looked capable of bringing a touch of composure to play, while Hibs also boasted one of the more clever players in Allan.

The opener came from an Allan corner one minute before half-time, French-born Congolese striker Malonga eventually firing the ball into the roof of the net after Liam Fontaine and Cummings had both seen efforts blocked.

Remarkably, this was the first time Hearts had trailed in a league game all season. Now we would find out something about the men who had begun to make this Championship lark look so easy.

They did not quite assert themselves with aplomb after the break, the tempo and direct running of Hibs continuing to unsettle the visitors.

Indeed, Malonga came close to making it 2-0 early in the second half, flashing his header from an Allan cross just wide. Allan himself did wonderfully to shrug aside Prince Buaben and tear towards the box moments later, the Hearts man clipping his opponent’s heels inches outside the box to concede a free-kick that, half a breath later, would have been a penalty.

Even as Hibs were flying in the final third, though, their own penalty area resembled a panic-stricken war zone. Cross after cross seemed capable of undoing all their good work, the ball being allowed to bounce far too often.

The introduction of Jamie Walker added something to Hearts, the winger taking just seconds to get into the fray, drilling a low cross through the legs of Lewis Stevenson and forcing Oxley to do well to deny Paterson.

The loss of skipper Wilson to injury soon after didn’t seem to disrupt Hearts too greatly, Buaben coming close to an equaliser as he stormed into the box and clipped a right-footed effort just past the far post.

When Paterson was then rightly red-carded for a wild, desperate, high, cynical and undoubtedly dangerous challenge on the fast-breaking Malonga after 78 minutes, though, even the most optimistic of Hearts fans must have feared the worst; they ended the game with a back three of Buaben, Gomis and Ozturk.

Cummings missed another good chance, this time with a header, to seal a Hibs victory. The suspicion lingered that, somehow, something would happen to punish the home team. 

Ozturk's brilliant effort in the last moments, which went in off the underside of the bar, brought Hearts level

Step forward Ozturk, a player whose longest of long-rangers would have been accompanied by cut-off cries of indignant protest from Hearts fans, management and team-mates — possibly even members of his own family — wondering what on earth he was doing, chancing his luck from that distance... oh, right. Jings!

It is telling that, while the boiling mass of maroon in the away end, prompted by the goal, was still in full eruption long after the final whistle, Hibs were actually applauded off the park, the home crowd recognising their contribution to a day of high drama.

The Hibees are vastly improved from the team who surrendered their Premiership place so meekly and, all things being equal, they should certainly feature in the promotion race.

Hearts? Still leading. Still setting a blistering pace. Still carrying with them an air of invincibility that is beginning to get almost spooky.
