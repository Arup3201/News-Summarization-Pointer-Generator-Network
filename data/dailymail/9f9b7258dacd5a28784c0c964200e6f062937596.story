It's a dangerous trip which most holidaymakers would do their best to avoid.

However, one intrepid traveller has taken trekking to new heights - building a campfire on the edge of an active volcano.

Matthew Karsten, from Florida, spent two days on the 12,400ft Santiaguito, in Guatemala, after giving up his day job and setting off to travel the world.

The 33-year-old travel blogger has spent the past four years visiting an amazing list of locations after he quit his job as a nightclub photographer in Miami.

Matthew said: 'I wasn't happy with my life as a nightclub and event photographer, so I decided to save money and travel the world.

'My trip began in Guatemala - it had a little bit of everything, interesting culture, beautiful landscapes, and tons of adventure activities.

'I travelled to the city of Quetzaltenango to see the Santiaguito volcano erupt from a distance, and met a guide who said he would take us camping on it.

'Hiking up to the edge of an erupting volcano is not something that you can do in the US.

'It was thrilling and exactly the type of experience I was hoping to have on my journey.

'The volcanic landscape felt alien, like we were exploring a new planet. There were strange rock formations, steam vents in the ground, and weird plants with giant leaves.

'And the eruptions themselves were incredible to witness up close. It felt like a true adventure with a hint of risk.

'People can't believe their eyes when they see the images, and I don't blame them. It looks like something out of a movie.

The volcano became active after months of calm, with three explosions recorded a day, with plumes of smoking reaching hundreds of feet into the sky.
