The suspect in a Mother's Day parade shooting that left 19 people wounded in New Orleans has been taken into custody, police have confirmed.

Suspect: Akein Scott has been arrested for allegedly shooting 19 people, including two children, during Mother's Day Parade in New Orleans

Previous: Police said Scott has an arrest record involving drug and weapon charges

Police previously said Scott had an arrest record involving drug and weapon charges.

Court records show some had been dropped but he was facing a felony charge of illegally carrying a weapon while in possession of a controlled dangerous substance.

Scott was scheduled for a court hearing on motions related to that case Thursday.

It was not immediately known whether he would be present for that hearing or whether it would be rescheduled.

Horror: Police released footage of a man opening fire on a neighborhood parade on Sunday

Do you know him? The footage is grainy but police are asking for any information on who he could be

Video released on Monday showed a 
crowd gathered for the Sunday parade suddenly scattering in all 
directions, with some falling to the ground.

They appear to be running from a man in a white T-shirt and dark pants who turns and runs out of the picture.

Police said they identified the suspect from the surveillance camera images.

As many as 400 people had come out for the event. Officers were interspersed with the marchers, which is routine for such events. The crime scene was about 1.5 miles from the heart of the French Quarter.

Two children were among those wounded.

Gun violence has flared at two other 
city celebrations this year. Five people were wounded in a drive-by 
shooting in January after a Martin Luther King Jr.

Day parade, and four were wounded in a
shooting after an argument in the French Quarter in the days leading up
to Mardi Gras. Two teens were arrested in connection with the MLK Day 
shootings; three men were arrested and charged in the Mardi Gras 
shootings.

Drama: This image from a mobile phone shows the immediate aftermath of the shooting as chaos unfolded
