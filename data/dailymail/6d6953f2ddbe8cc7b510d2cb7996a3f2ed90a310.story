Bygone beauty tutorial teaches you how to get 1920s make-up look

With viewing figures of almost 
10 million every week, the popularity of ITV's 
charming period drama Downton Abbey is in no doubt.

But it appears a weekly television fix is not enough for some Downton fans who are so taken with the upstairs/downstairs lives of
the 1920s characters that they want to look like them too...even when the series isn't on air.

Fashion brands have already reported increased interest in retro flapper style dresses and demure ruffled blouses and now it seems women want to go one step further in stealing the style of ladies of the 
manor Sybil, Mary and Edith Crawley by copying their beauty regime too.

Get the Downton look: Women are desperate to emulate the Crawley's beauty look so John Lewis have launched tutorials

Unlike current celebrity styles the retro beauty looks inspired by period drama aren't actually very easy to achieve.

To help wannabe ladies of the manor John Lewis on Oxford Street, London is introducing one-to-one beauty master classes teaching customers how to achieve a vintage style – from the Downton pout to the pretty Dickensian blush.

Get the look: From feline flicks to rosebud lips, you will be taught the tricks of the trade

Customers can achieve the Lady Grantham with a little help from the in store Lancôme team who will deliver lessons in how to create feline flicks and rosebud lips.

Michael Butt, Department Manager Beauty at John Lewis Oxford Street, said: 'Women often come to our partners in the Beauty Hall here at John Lewis’ flagship store looking for advice on how to create looks they have seen on screen.

Bygone Beauty Tutorials will enable our customers to give their Christmas party look a vintage twist.'
