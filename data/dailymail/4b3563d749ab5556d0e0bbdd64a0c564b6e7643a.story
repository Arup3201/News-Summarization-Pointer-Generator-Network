The New York bakery known made world-famous for introducing the Cronut remained closed Monday after a failed health department inspection last week.

Dominique Ansel Bakery on Spring Street has been host to hour-long waits in the morning with tourists and locals alike dying to try the Cronut -  a croissant/doughnut hybrid.

But the sidewalk was empty Monday after inspectors found several hundred mouse droppings on the premises.

Still closed: Dominique Ansel Bakery remained shut Monday after failing a health inspection on Friday. The health department sent inspectors to the Spring Street shop after a customer posted a video online showing a mouse on the bakery floor

Appetite ruined? The bakery became world-famous last year after introducing the Cronut, a croissant/doughnut hybrid. Department of Health officials say they found several mouse droppings on the floor at the bakery

The health department responded after a customer posted a video online Thursday showing a mouse scampering around the bakery floor.

YouTube user Cody Pickrodt shot the video at Dominique Ansel, telling Gothamist: 'I
 pointed it out to a couple waiting in line behind me. They didn't 
believe it until I showed them the video. Then they had to leave.

'I didn't mention it to employees. It appeared they were all aware of it.

'This
 was the tail end of the little guy's adventure. He ran all over the 
place in plain view for a good 20 seconds before I got my phone out,' Mr Pickrodt said.

After
 the video was posted online, workers at the bakery spent seven hours in
 a deep clean and a spokesman told MailOnline that not a single mouse was found.

But
 a health department spokesman had a very different story tell after 
shutting the establishment down for a 'severe' pest infestation.

'What
 made the infestation severe was that the health inspector found several
 hundred mouse droppings,' a DOH spokesman told Gothamist.

Bakery
 spokesman Amy Ma maintained that the DOH 'did not find a single mouse 
or any rodent' and that 'evidence of infestation' was really just cracks
 and holes in the walls.

She says they are now waiting for a re-inspection which they expected for Monday.

The
 health department spokesman said a re-inspection wouldn't happen until 
the bakery submitted a pest control plan which hadn't been turned in 
yet.

The restaurant previously had an A health rating despite being cited for 'evidence of live mice present' in October.

The shuttered door at the bakery came as a disappointment for many who showed up unaware of the recent health inspection.

'This
 bakery was our first stop in New York,' a tourist from Atlanta, Georgia
 told the New York Daily News. 'I would think they'd keep their food in 
good condition, I would have waited.'

Local Carmine Soprano, 28, was just as angry when he showed up to get a few doughnuts for co-workers and saw no line.

'This is horrible!' Mr Soprano said.

'I
 worked in a lot of restaurants and bakeries, it's just a part of most 
restaurants in New York, You can't really prevent it,' he added.

Bold mouse: The YouTube use who took the video says he saw the mouse scamper around for a good 20 seconds before taking out his camera phone

The video came just a few days days after 
another YouTube user posted two videos of rats infesting a Garment 
District Dunkin' Donuts location. 

After
 hearing about the reports, the New York City Health Department 
investigated and shut down the store at West 37th Street and 8th Avenue,
 citing a 'severe' pest infestation.

While the location manager initially denied the store had a vermin problem when contacted by Gothamist on Wednesday, today a man who answered the phone said: 'We have some issues'.
