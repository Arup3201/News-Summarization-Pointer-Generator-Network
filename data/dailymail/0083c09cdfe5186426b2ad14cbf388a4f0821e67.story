Andy Murray produced a classic display of hard-nosed and controlled tennis to set up a version of Friends Reunited in the semi-finals of the Australian Open.

The 27-year-old Scot defused the power of Australian tyro Nick Kyrgios to come through 6-3, 7-6 (7-5), 6-3 to clear the path to a fascinating contest against Tomas Berdych, now coached by Murray's long-time friend and chief lieutenant Dani Vallverdu.

Murray was like an expert football team playing away from home – soaking up the pressure and coming with a solid, skilfull, tactical game to defy the home crowd and get the right result.

He will need to show the same kind of composure against world No 7 Berdych, who is already blossoming under the tutelage of Venezuelan Vallverdu, who learned so much from his time with Ivan Lendl helping Murray win grand slams.

Berdych earlier defeated Rafael Nadal 6-2, 6-0, 7-6, and will be full of confidence after not dropping a set in his five matches here.

But then so should Murray, after coming through a much-hyped contest against the 19-year-old Australian whose time looks sure to come. This was an awkward assignment for him against someone with partisan backing from the 15,000 crowd, although the Scot will have felt at home in temperatures somewhat reminiscent of Dunblane.

He gave a masterclass in difficult conditions on how to pick apart an opponent, who should have learned plenty from it. Murray has come into a rich vein of form this early in the season at a tournament where he has reached the semi-final or better five times now.

'It was a tricky match and very windy, I tried to start as quickly as possible because I know how dangerous Nick can be and what he is capable of,' said Murray. 'He is a huge hitter and so I tried to keep it out of his strike zone.

'It's understandable that he had great support, to play in front of a packed crowd like this was a privilege.'

Murray will come up against his long time friend Dani Vallverdu, who now coaches Tomas Berdych, in the semi-finals 

Murray, who now has a 11-0 record against Australians, knows that a colossal task awaits him now against Berdych.

He said: 'It's going to be a tough match, he is a big hitter and so far he has played extremely well this tournament.'

The world No 6 had been phlegmatic under pressure, with his serve the bedrock of an excellent performance, winning two thirds of the points on his second delivery.

He also teased Kyrgios with a tantalising mixture of angles, slices and pace, so often giving him the kind of ball he did not want to hit. Such was his consistency that the teenager never really got momentum going.

Murray took the opener in 32 minutes and might have ended the second sooner than he did, although Kyrgios's booming serve was coming into its own. In the tiebreak Murray hit two exquisite lobs to turn it his way, the second of them clnching the set.

Kyrgios again came back at him from 2-4 down in the third, gaining his one break of serve, but Murray's response was exemplary and he skilfully conunter attacked at the end.

Now he has a massive test against Berdych, and with Vallverdu suddenly in the opposite corner he will know there is nobody better equipped on how to give inside information on how to beat him.

Murray was afterwards reluctant to get into the subject of facing his former colleague Vallverdu, with whom he split in late November, but it clearly a live issue: 'I don't really want to talk about what Dani's strengths and weaknesses are. I'm happy to talk about Berdych and what his strengths and weaknesses are but I don't want to discuss what Dani does well and doesn't do well,' he said.

'I'm not playing against him. I don't think in loads of sports people talk about other players' coaches and managers and whatnot.

'We'll see how the match plays out and what the tactics are. But I also know what Dani thinks of Berdych's game because he's told me, so it works both ways. I don't know what it will be like, maybe I'll find it weird on the day. My goal isn't to beat Dani, it's to beat Berdych.'

The Australian, who played a five setter against Andreas Seppi in the previous round, looked drained towards the end of the match

By contrast, Murray looked fitter than ever after an intense winter training regime
