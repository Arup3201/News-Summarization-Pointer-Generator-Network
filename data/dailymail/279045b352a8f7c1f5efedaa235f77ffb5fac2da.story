England have booked a place in the Commonwealth Games women's hockey semi finals with a 2-1 win over Scotland.

In a winner-takes-all clash at Glasgow's National Hockey Centre, England could have also progressed with a draw but made things sure through goals from Alex Danson and Susannah Townsend.

Nikki Kidd scored a consolation for Scotland and they pushed for an equaliser in a tough second half but England held to reach a semi final against New Zealand on Friday.

Nicolas White laid on an excellent pass into the D to allow Danson to give England the lead with a great finish over Amy Gibson after 17 minutes.

Later in the first period Townsend doubled the lead from a penalty corner before Kidd's own penalty corner consolation for the Scots.

A frentic first half gave way to a more nervy second period but England, ranked sixth in the world, hung on to progress.

Admiration: Rio Ferdinand was impressed with the quality of England's performance

And former England football international Rio Ferdinand was impressed as he watched at home, taking a particular shine to Danson's skill that led to her first half opener.

Speaking about Ferdinand's praise, Danson told the BBC: 'It's fantastic to generate support. That is our game - fast, athletic, skilful and brilliant to watch. To have the chance to showcase that at a venue like this is wonderful.'
