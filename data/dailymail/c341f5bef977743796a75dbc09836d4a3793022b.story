At least 13 people died in Ukraine today after shelling hit a tram in the war-torn city of Donetsk hours after peace talks called for a ceasefire.

The shell struck the vehicle, instantly killing numerous passengers and blowing out the windows of a nearby building.

Twelve people were killed in the tram while another died in a car that was passing nearby, an emergency services official said.

It came as Ukrainian forces all but abandoned the city's airport after months of bitter fighting which has left 10 government soldiers dead in the last day alone. 

The shelling took place in a part of the city under the control of Pro-Russian separatists who are fighting Ukrainian government forces. 

It was not immediately clear which side was responsible for the attack, but angry residents punched and kicked a captured soldier who was dragged to the scene by the rebels. 

Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk blamed pro-Russian rebels for the attack.

'Today Russian terrorists again committed a terrible act against humanity. Russia bears responsibility for this,' he said at a ceremony to mark Unity Day in Kiev.

Meanwhile, Kiev said its soldiers pulled out of the main part of the airport, although military officials continue to insist they hold part of the complex.

'Yesterday evening, we made the decision to leave the new terminal,' military spokesman Vladyslav Seleznyov said in reference to the main airport building that had been held by Kiev forces since May.

'We continue to control the southern part of the airport... we left the new terminal because it looks like a sieve and there's simply nowhere to hide there.'

He said that 'on the whole, 10 soldiers were killed and 16 wounded in the past day of fighting' across the pro-Russian separatist east.

Russian television reporters yesterday toured the airport building and showed the bodies of dead Ukrainian soldiers. 

Fighting for the airport peaked over the weekend, shattering the relative tranquility in place since a new truce was reached in early December. 

Hours before the tram shelling, Russia and Ukraine agreed on a dividing line from where both sides should pull back their heavy weapons in the city. 

Germany's foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who hosted a meeting of his counterparts from Russia, Ukraine and France, said the four parties had agreed the demarcation line defined in the Minsk agreement of last year should form the basis for the withdrawal.

Under the plan, Ukraine and the pro-Russian separatists would pull back their heavy arms nine miles on either side of the line, though there was no agreement on a withdrawal of all troops.

'Today we have finally agreed that the demarcation line mentioned in the Minsk agreement is the line from where the withdrawal of heavy weapons needs to take place now,' Mr Steinmeier told reporters after the meeting in Berlin.

He said the agreement had been 'difficult work' and the talks, which follow a fruitless round of negotiations last week, were 'testing the patience of all involved'.

The parties also agreed that the contact group of Ukraine, Russia, and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) should meet as soon as possible to lay further groundwork for a high-level meeting in Kazakhstan's capital Astana aimed at reaching a long-lasting settlement.

Separately, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said the 'strong support' for the pull-back was the meeting's most important result.

He said the foreign ministers did not discuss the sanctions that the West has imposed on Russia over the Ukraine crisis: 'The sanctions are not our problem, it is the problem of those who introduced them and now do not know how to extricate themselves.'

Earlier yesterday, Mr Lavrov had urged measures to contain the unfolding unrest, but said nothing about the rebels surrendering territory they acquired in violation of a peace deal concluded in September in Belarus.

Ukraine says separatist forces that are backed by Russia have overstepped agreed-upon frontline boundaries between the warring sides by 190 square miles.

A fresh separatist advance is under way in an area north-west of Luhansk, the second-largest rebel-held city. The fighting is centred on two checkpoints along a strategic highway.

Ukraine's defence ministry said one of those positions, Checkpoint 31, had been abandoned but that operations were under way to retake it.

Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of providing material support to the separatists, which Moscow denies.

The sheer amount of sophisticated heavy weaponry in the hands of the insurgents, however, is widely seen as overwhelming evidence of direct involvement by Russia.

Addressing the World Economic Forum in Davos, Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko held up a piece of a bullet-riddled bus as evidence of shelling last week by Russian heavy artillery in his country. 

He said the metal came from a bus in the town of Volnovakha, where 13 people were killed by what he described as Russian shelling.

'For me this is a symbol, a symbol of the terroristic attack against my country,' he said, comparing it to the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over rebel-held eastern Ukraine last summer.

He called it a 'global problem,' extending far beyond just Ukraine's borders, cutting short his visit to Davos to deal with the crisis in his country.

He says 9,000 Russian troops are occupying 7 per cent of Ukrainian territory.

The fighting in the Luhansk region follows intense clashes over the weekend for control of the airport on the fringes of the main rebel city, Donetsk.

The terminal - once the pride of the city but now reduced to a burned-out shell - is of limited strategic value.

Now, however, it has acquired symbolic value because of the Ukrainian forces' stand against waves of separatist attacks.

The fierce airport battle shattered the relative tranquility that had been in place since a new truce was reached in early December.
