Middle-income Americans are spending about $245,000 raising a child until adulthood, with families living in the Northeast taking on a greater burden, a new study has found.

Those costs — food, housing, childcare and education — rose 1.8 percent over the previous year, according to the latest Agriculture Department's Expenditures on Children and Families report.

As in the past, families in the urban Northeast will spend more than families in the urban South and rural parts of the US, or roughly $282,480.

When adjusting for projected inflation, the report found that a child born last year could cost a middle-income family an average of about $304,480.

Difference: This USAD chart shows it cost more than $245,000 to raise a child in 2013 compared with $198,000 in 1960 (in 2013 dollars)

Outlays: This USAD chart shows how much middle-income American families spend raising their child, with housing comprising the biggest outlay

The USDA's annual report, based on the government's Consumer Expenditure Survey, found families were consistent in how they spent their money across all categories from 2012 to 2013.

The costs associated with pregnancy or expenses accumulated after a child becomes an adult, such as college tuition, were not included.

In 1960, the first year the report was issued, a middle-income family could spend about $25,230, equivalent to $198,560 in 2013 dollars, to raise a child until the age of 18.

Housing costs remain the greatest child-rearing expense, as they did in the 1960s, although current-day costs like childcare were negligible back then.

For middle-income families, the USDA found, housing expenses made up roughly 30 percent of the total cost of raising a child.

Child care and education were the second-largest expenses, at 18 percent, followed by food at 16 percent.

Expenses per child decrease as a family has more children, the report found, as families with three or more children spend 22 percent less per child than families with two children.

That's because more children share bedrooms, clothing and toys, and food can be purchased in larger, bulk quantities.
