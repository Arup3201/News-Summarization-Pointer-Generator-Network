With wide smiles plastered across their faces as they held hands Tony Blair and his wife Cherie arrived at LAX airport in Los Angeles this week.

At one point Mrs Blair -  even though it looked slightly awkward - rested her face on the former Prime Minister's shoulder as they walked through the California airport to catch their departing flight.

The former British Prime Minister and his wife had both given separate talks in Beverly Hills at the Milken Institute Global Conference, a four day event looking at solutions to global social and economic challenges.

Mrs Blair was beaming as she arrived wearing a blue mac, polka dot shirt and white trousers while carrying a Louis Vuitton bag. Mr Blair opted for a dark grey suit with red tie

Last month Mrs Blair, 59, was 
photographed looking glum on a break in Spain's Marbella, but yesterday 
she beamed as she arrived wearing a blue mac, a polka dot
 shirt and white trousers carrying a Louis Vuitton bag.

Mr
 Blair, 60, his hair thinner and more grey than when he was in power, 
wore a dark grey suit with a red tie and also looked more jovial.

Their
 determined effort to put on a united front is not all that surprising 
given the recent spotlight on their marriage following allegations 
of a close relationship between Mr Blair, 60, and Wendi Deng, the former
 wife of Rupert Murdoch.

The media mogul has said he divorced his wife because of claims she was close to the former Prime Minister.

Last month Murdoch, 83, confirmed he was prompted to file for divorce 
by claims of Miss Deng's closeness to the former Labour party leader.

Murdoch
 said friends had kept him in the dark over alleged meetings between the
 pair at Murdoch's Californian ranch while he was away.

He told Fortune magazine: 'Well, you know, everybody was talking about these things and never telling me anything.

'But then I
 was told two pretty circumstantial things about the ranch. I was in 
Australia. When I got back, I naturally asked staff and it opened up,' Mr Murdoch added.

'That's the story. And then, you know, a week later I filed. As soon as I could find a lawyer.'

Although
 he did not name Mr Blair, his comments tally with claims in Vanity Fair
 magazine linking Mr Blair to at least two suspicious trysts at the 
ranch with Miss Deng.

It
 was alleged in February that Miss Deng, 45, had written notes to 
herself in which she praised Mr Blair's 'good body', his 'really, really
 good legs' and his 'butt'.

Tony Blair and his wife Cherie were pictured walking down a street in Marbella, southern Spain last month

In a list 
of reasons why 'I'm so missing Tony', Chinese-born Miss Deng later 
gushed about his 'blue eyes which I love', it is claimed.

Mr
 Blair, who is godfather to one of Murdoch's daughters, has always 
denied any affair but has not spoken publicly about the claims.

He and Cherie have been married since 1980 and have four children; Euan, 30, Nicky, 28, Kathryn, 26, and Leo, 13.

Murdoch said he went straight to a divorce lawyer after hearing claims Blair and Miss Deng had met up while he was away

They
 were together at Euan's marriage to Suzanne Ashman at All Saints parish
 church in Wotton Underwood, Buckingshire, last September.

Mr Blair's travels 
the world in his new roles as business consultant and public speaker.

In
 the last year he has been seen disembarking from a Â£30million private 
jet at in Bangkok, Sardinia and New York state, and the top-of-the-range
 Bombardier Global Express private jet has also been seen in 
Switzerland, Ukraine and Israel on dates which matched Mr Blairâ€™s 
visits.

The Blairs were pictured laughing at their son Euan's wedding last September
