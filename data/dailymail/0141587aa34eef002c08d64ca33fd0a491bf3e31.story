To her family, Amira Karroum was a carefree girl from the Gold Coast who went dancing in night clubs and hung out with her friends.

But after moving to Sydney's west in 2011, she and her sister, Rose, became devout Muslims and donned hijabs.

Her father - a restaurant owner on Queensland's Gold Coast - described his daughter, who went to an Anglican private school and came from a wealthy family, as 'beautiful'.

Her father, Mohammed Karroum, said his daughter was 'beautiful', and liked barbecues and clubbing

Mohammed Karroum said she and her friends would enjoy barbecues at their waterfront home where she would swim and dance.

'She goes to the nightclub with her sister, just having a good time like any ordinary girl,' he told ABC's 7.30.

In 2013, she married Islamic extremist Tyler Perry who was a seasoned jihadist from Brisbane, Queensland and had converted to the religion during his time in the U.S. as a teenager.

His mother took him to Colorado after the then-13-year-old's behaviour started getting out of control.

It was there he discovered Islam under the teachings of senior al-Qaeda figure Anwar al Awlaki.

Perry's half-brother Josiah Turnbull told the 7.30 Report his rebellious brother came back a changed man after his stint in the U.S. and kept out of trouble.

In the following years, Mr Turnbull said his half-brother travelled overseas a lot under the pretense he was carrying out missionary work.

Perry's half-brother Josiah Turnbull said the jihadist came back a changed man after his visit to the U.S.

Mr Turnbull said he was not sure what Perry was doing but he could have been taking part in military training camps for al-Qaeda.

It was in Sydney the paths of Ms Karroum and Perry crossed.

At the time, he was part of Street Dawah - a group looking to convert Australians to the Islamic faith and was led by Mohammad Ali Baryalei.

It was through the group that he met Ms Karroum's cousins Bilal Sayadi and Fadl Sayadi.

Fadl was one of the men arrested as part of Australian terror plot Operation Pendennis along with Australian jihadist Khaled Sharrouf.

In April 2013, the couple were married but their union came as a shock to both their families, particularly to Ms Karroum's father Mohammed who initially refused to sanction the marriage.

'Then my cousin came to me and he started talking to me: "He's [Perry] alright, he's beautiful person",' Mr Karroum said.

'And they got married there and then - that day.'

But this union would be short lived as Perry and his new bride had plans to join Ali Baryalei in Syria, with authorities believing the Kings Cross security guard has now risen to a senior position of terror group and al-Qaeda off-shoot Islamic State.

Perry made the move to the Middle East first before his bride followed earlier this year after a failed attempt to flee the country in December last year.

Mohammad Ali Baryalei was the leader of Street Dawah - a group dedicated to converting Australians to Islam - and Perry and Ms Karroum were planning to join him in Syria

Before she left, Ms Karroum made one last visit to her father - who owned a Gold Coast restaurant - in Queensland.

Mr Karroum said he had sensed something was wrong.

'She came and saw me before she left, I didn't know she was leaving, and she hugged me and she started to cry,' he said.

'I said to her, "What's wrong?", she said to me, "Nothing, I just love you Dad".

'And I accepted it - I didn't know she was saying goodbye.'

When Ms Karroum arrived in Syria to join her husband, a bloody conflict was playing out in the city of Aleppo between ISIS - which is now known as Islamic State - and another extremist group, Jabhat Al Nusra.

It was here she and Perry would spend their final days before they were executed in a home they shared with another couple during a Jabhat Al Nusra ambush.

'She sent me a message: "Please Dad, pray to Allah and ask him to forgive you for the days, for the years you have not prayed for him, death is around the corner Dad. I love you",' an emotional Mohammed Karroum recalled.

Two days after his daughter arrived in the Middle East, she was killed by a spray of bullets and her body dismembered.

'I love her so much...I missed everything about her. Sheâ€™s gone forever,' Mr Karroum said.
