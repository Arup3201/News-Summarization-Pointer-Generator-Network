The capital has seen several days of crazy clothing both on and off the catwalks as some of the world's best designers showcase their wares during London Fashion Week.

But fittingly, one of the most bizarre shows of the week came right at the end of the style event - with a show by Marko Mitanovski.

The Serbian designer hosted one of the most jaw-dropping collections at the Freemasons' Hall earlier today.

Marko Mitanovski showcased a bizarre collection at London Fashion Week earlier today, sending the models down the catwalk painted from head-to-toe in black paint 

Models painted from head to toe in black paint were sent down the catwalk in leather and latex designs that were inspired by nature and architecture. 

The ghoulish-looking models had most of their features completely hidden by the shiny oils, which were then accessorised with black facial jewels. 

In contrast, the final model sent down the catwalk was painted in a bright white.

Marko told Modaterra.com that his inspiration for the theme of the show came from the outside world, saying: 'I was inspired by nature, birds, skeletons and architecture.

'I worked with sculptures for this collection and jewelry design. It was how I created the pieces with latex and leather.'

The designs were inspired by birds and architecture 

While his collection was based on many different influences, Marko's choice to paint the models in black came simply down to his tastes in colour. 

He said: 'I chose to do the whole collection in black because it's my favourite colour. [This collection] is about celebrating life in a weird way,  I do not believe it's dark - It's about something mystical, not about something that is negative.'

Marko also revealed that the reason behind finishing the show with a model painted in white was simply because it contrasted with the other models. 

He said: 'The last collection closed the show with someone using only white, so I decided to do the same this season.' 

Marko hoped to create a mystical allure using the black body paint

Only a few of the models were free to walk down the catwalk without any body paint

The Serbian designer is known for creating sculptural and theatrical creations 

The London-based fashion maven, whose designs have been worn by the likes of   Paloma Faith, Skunk Anansie, Katie Melua and Immodesty Blaize, is known for his sculptural and theatrical creations.

His biggest celebrity fan though, is Lady Gaga, who even wore the designer's creations on her Monster Ball world tour. 

Gaga's ex-stylist Nicola Formichetti saw his collection at London Fashion Week in 2009 and got in contact to ask if he would help with costumes for a photoshoot they were doing for W magazine, the partnership then grew from there. 

Marko told lanciatrendvisions.com: 'Nicola Formichetti saw my collection and asked me to make costumes for Lady Gaga’s shoot for Q Magazine. 

'Then we did some more costumes for interludes of her Monster Ball Tour, as well as for her Android Telephones campaign and many other projects.

'Lady Gaga’s influence in fashion definitely helped me in getting bigger international exposure, but it's also thanks to her team.' 

The single white model was designed to create a contrast among the women painted in black

A huge team of stylists and make-up artists were on hand to create the bizarre catwalk looks 

Adding the jewels and make-up took hours for each model 

Many of the models had their features obscured by the dark paint
