For the second time in a week, the University of Technology Sydney's library has been evacuated due to a bomb threat.

At 3pm this afternoon the Haymarket campus was cleared of students and staff, including the adjacent UTS campus building,  Building Five.

Evacuation sirens sounded 'continuously' after NSW Police were alerted that the library had received a bomb threat.

It's exactly one week since emergency services closed the campus after a bomb scare.

Details about the bomb threat or any possible suspects are unknown.

Students are evacuated from the Haymarket campus at the University of Technology Sydney, after the second bomb threat in a week. The bomb threat was to the library and adjacent Building Five

Mounted police arrived to evacuate the crowds from the university and nearby shopping centre Market City, telling people to leave the vicinity as quickly as they could in response to a bomb threat.

The busy inner city streets quickly looked like 'a ghosttown' as hundreds of people were evacuated, with NSW Police reacting to the second bomb threat to the UTS library in a week

NSW Police were on site and allowed people to re-enter the Library and Building Five at around 5.45pm, almost three hours after the emergency evacuation.

Police have called it a 'precautionary operation' and tell Daily Mail Australia 'the police operation has been finished and nothing was found.'

The exclusion zone cordoned off the surrounding areas near the busy innercity campus, leaving the area 'like a ghost town' according to witness, UTS student David Barden.

NSW Police suspended the light rail service at Haymarket, closed nearby Ultimo Road and pushed the exclusion zone past the Entertainment Centre.

Students and staff were updated about the bomb scare through the University of Technology Sydney's various social media accounts

The Haymarket light rail was suspended as police cordoned off the area. A bystander writes on Twitter: 'this area was full ten minutes ago.'

19-year-old UTS Journalism Law student David Barden was evacuated from Building Five during both police operations.

Mr Barden says this afternoon during the second bomb scare, people were more panicked and the police seemed more concerned than they were during last Monday's evacuation.

'Police seemed really worried this time. The exclusion zone they set last Monday was only 10-15 metres, but this time they told us to leave the vicinity straight away and get as far as we could from the general area. The exclusion zone pushed everybody in the area out towards the Capitol Theatre.'

Mr Barden says that the 'atmosphere was so different this time', with everyone leaving the site almost immediately.

'People are definitely concerned. At first, students were thinking maybe it was just a hoax. But when the sirens didn't stop and more and more police arrived, including mounted police, people got quite panicked and weren't willing to wait around,' said Mr Barden.

The university could not be reached for comment but stayed in contact with students through their Twitter accounts and the university email.

Emergency services shut the area off for almost three hours as they investigated the university's second bomb threat in a week.
