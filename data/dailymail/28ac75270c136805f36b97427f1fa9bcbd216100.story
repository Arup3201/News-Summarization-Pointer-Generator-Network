As a teenager, Emma Burton was taunted by bullies for  weighing 27 stone and having to wear a custom-made size 32 school uniform.

Those same tormentors were stunned this year to see that she is now a size 10, having lost 16st 7lb – more than half her body weight – in just over 12 months.

Miss Burton, now 22 and a striking 6ft mother of two, said it was ‘such an amazing feeling’ to shock the girls who made fun of her.

Transformed: Emma Burton, 22, has lost 17 stone on the Cambridge weightloss plan

‘I was verbally and physically bullied
 for years, all the way through secondary school,’ she added. ‘The whole
 school had a nickname for me. I was known as “The Burtonator” – because
 everyone said I was built like the Terminator.

‘I was enormous. I had a specially 
made man’s blazer, as my mum couldn’t buy one big enough for me. It was a
 50-inch chest, the same size as a bodybuilder. But since I’ve lost 
weight, I’ve seen some of the girls who made my life hell and they 
didn’t even recognise me.

‘It was the best feeling in the world to go over and introduce myself. Their jaws hit the floor when they realised who I was.’

Miss Burton, from Chatham in Kent, 
said that although she enjoyed showing off her new size, her main 
motivation for losing the weight was her children, Liam, three, and 
Jennifer, 15 months.

Then: Emma has struggled with her weight from a young age and was bullied at school because of her size

Now: The school bullies didn't recognise her now she's a slim size 10

She was horrified when she saw pictures of herself cradling Liam after his birth, saying she wanted to ‘rip them up’.

Any weight loss was put on hold when 
she got pregnant again, but after having Jennifer she began the strict 
Cambridge weight loss plan, which she read about and had cleared by her 
doctor. The diet restricts slimmers to soups and shakes for a period, 
before slowly reintroducing ‘real’ food in a measured way.

Miss Burton, who is studying music at 
the University of Kent, then transformed her diet, swapping dinners of 
takeaway pizzas and crisps for chicken salads and grilled meat.

No longer fits: As a size 32 school girl, she had to have a specially-made uniform

Whereas she used to drink ten cans of the soft drink Vimto a day, she now has eight glasses of water.

By her daughter’s first birthday, she 
weighed 10st 9lb and could fit into a size 10 party dress. Miss Burton, 
who has separated from her children’s father, said: ‘I’ve been hugely 
overweight my whole life and never in a million years did I think I’d be
 able to go clothes shopping in a normal shop, let alone buy a size 10.

'Amazing feeling': The mother-of-two said she's delighted she can now be more active with her children

‘I lost weight so quickly, and once it
 started coming off it was easy to keep going. I used to be so 
embarrassed to be seen by other people, I’d avoid going out.

‘I did all my shopping online. Now, I 
love going shopping – especially for new clothes. I love being able to 
take my baby out for long strolls in her pram and not be out of breath.

‘My family and friends even struggle to recognise me in a crowd sometimes.’

Miss Burton said she has now forgiven the bullies.

‘They couldn’t apologise enough for 
how they treated me,’ she said. ‘But I lost the weight for me and my 
children, not for them.’
