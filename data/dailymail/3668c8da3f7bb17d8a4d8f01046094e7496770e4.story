Doctors witnessed the bravery of marine Kyle Carpenter with his stunning recovery from his injuries for diving on a grenade to save a comrade in Afghanistan in November 2010.

President Barack Obama will award Marine Corporal Kyle Carpenter, 24, the Medal of Honor today for selflessly jumping on a grenade to save Lance Corporal Nicholas Eufrazio while they stood guard on a rooftop in Helmand province, Afghanistan, in November 2010.

But it was his stoic recovery from injuries which saw his lungs and heart stop several times, bones broken from head to toe, the loss of an eye and most of his teeth which moved doctors from the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.

In a moving video tribute posted before he received the highest U.S military honor, Debra L. Malone said he never once complained as he battled for his life and always giving 110 per cent during recovery.

After the blast, he needed more than 30 operations, and was fitted with a glass eye.

'I honestly believe Kyle made an effort to protect his family and his fellow marines. I don't think he wanted to see his fellow marines see him suffer,’ Dr Malone said.

'He knew that his fellow marines would be at some point going off to war and they might be faced with the same type of challenge.

'You would never know what he's been through. All his injuries have become a part of him, and he's proud of his injuries.’

Doctor Lauren T. Greer said: ‘No one survives a grenade blast, especially when you jump on top of it. But he always looked happy to be alive.

‘It’s extraordinary that he’s able to walk and use his legs as well as he can.’  

Vincent Auth said he was 'very polite, very grateful, and very appreciative' of everything that was being done by the doctors. he was just a great kid to work on.

'His mother had mentioned he had the most beautiful smile, and I asked her to bring pictures in of him,  and every time he came back he seemed to look more like those photos, even though he went a long time without any lower teeth,' Dr Auth said.

Corporal Carpenter held his hand over his heart before the Washington Nationals played the Houston Astros at the Nationals Park in Washington.

Speaking to the Marine Corps Times earlier this year, Corporal Carpenter said he had been in Afghanistan for five months before the blast.

'We knew the area we were moving into was one of the rougher areas,' he said.

Even though he has since left the Marines, Corporal Carpenter has maintained close ties - and has been guest of honor at several command events.

On the anniversary of the blast last year, he wrote on Facebook to thank his supporters.

He said: 'It's hard to comprehend that three years ago today my life and body was torn apart by an enemy hand grenade on a hot dusty rooftop in Afghanistan.'

'At times it has felt so long ago and yet, when I close my eyes, I can still feel the warm blood pouring out of me onto my skin and fading out of consciousness with my the final thought of "I'm going to die" in my head... And here I am.'

Corporal Carpenter will be the third Marine to receive the Medal of Honor since the start of the Afghanistan and war in 2001.

Dakota Meyer became the first Marine Medal of Honor recipient from the war in Afghanistan in 2011 and Cpl. Jason Dunham was recognized posthumously for smothering a grenade in Iraq in 2004.
