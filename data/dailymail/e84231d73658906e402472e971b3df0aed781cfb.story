Women who take paracetamol during pregnancy may increase the risk of their child developing ADHD

Women who take paracetamol during pregnancy may increase the risk of their child developing ADHD, new research has found.

While it is the most common drug taken to relieve pain, a New Zealand researcher said the new findings were 'alarming'.

The Auckland University backs a Danish study from earlier this year which linked the popular painkiller to behavioural disorders.

The study analysed data from a study of 871 European infants.

The researchers analysed the drug use of paracetamol, aspirin, antacids, and antibiotics during pregnancy.

They then measured behavioural difficulties and ADHD symptoms in children at age seven and age 11.

Almost half of the study mothers took paracetamol during pregnancy and their children were more at risk of behavioural difficulties and ADHD.

The other drugs caused no significant differences in behaviour, the study found.

‘The finding that even low doses of paracetamol (indicated by the number of weeks of drug exposure) can affect behaviour seven years later is alarming because it is the most commonly used antenatal drug,’study leader Dr John Thompson said.

But the study did not have data on whether the ADHD symptoms continued in puberty, if the parents had ADHD, or what kind of dosage and in which trimester the mothers had used paracetamol.

‘More research is needed to provide a more precise assessment of the risk and consequences of taking this pain killer during pregnancy,’ Dr Thompson said.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or ADHD affects five to 10 per cent of school-age children in New Zealand, making it the most common neurodevelopmental disorder for the age group.
