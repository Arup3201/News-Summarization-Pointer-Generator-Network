Two teenagers accused of stealing three motorbikes in Bolivia were tied to a tree covered in fire ants

Two men nearly died in Bolivia after they were accused of stealing motorbikes by angry Amazonian villagers who tied them to a tree swarming with fire ants.

The men, aged 18 and 19, were accused of swiping three bikes worth $3,700 (Â£2,200) from a village near Cochabambain, central Bolivia.

Furious locals kept them captive for three days, demanding money to replace the vehicles, and eventually threw the men on to the ant nest to force their families to pay up.

After the ordeal the two men were taken to hospital where one needed dialysis for kidney failure, and the other is still in intensive care.

A sister of one of the men told a local radio station that the two men were only freed on Saturday after their families agreed to pay the ransom.

She added that, if the money had not been paid, then the two teenagers would be dead.

The ants used, known as plant-inhabiting ants, live inside trees, helping them grow by clearing other plants away that might compete with them for food or light.

They are not generally aggressive and will only sting when attacked, usually when somebody accidentally steps on their nest or into their territory.

The ants use mandibles to lock on to their prey, before injecting venom which can be fatal in large doses

They will use their strong front mandibles to bite the target, locking them in, before using their tail barb to sing repeatedly.

Their venom is an anti-inflammatory, and in small doses can be used as a traditional cure for arthritis, but in large doses can be extremely poisonous, causing kidney and liver failure.
