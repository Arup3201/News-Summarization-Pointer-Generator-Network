A Malaysian man has been left in critical condition after he was attacked by a machete-wielding gang at a local cinema for 'looking at them funny'.

Slightly cross-eyed Osman bin Musa, 20, was leaving a cinema in George Town, the capital of the state of Penang, when a group of young men accused him of wanting trouble

CCTV footage shows the gang attacking Mr bin Musa using a machete following a late-night screening of sci-fi thriller Jupiter Ascending.

'Osama is slightly cross eyed and it does occasionally get people making comments, and usually wears sunglasses,' a friend told local media.  

'But we had just come out of the cinema and he did not have them on, and as he walked into the foyer, a man asked him: "what are you looking at?"'

According to witnesses, Mr bin Musa's reluctance to respond as not to antagonise the man, only angered the thug.

After first throwing an object at Mr bin Musa, the entire gang attacked him in the foyer.  

Seconds later, Mr bin Musa can be seen on CCTV being pursued by a man wielding a machete, chopping at him as he runs through the cinema.

The footage from the cinema confirms that the incident had been unprovoked and police say they are now looking for the culprits, and appealing for witnesses to come forward.

'We have identified the other suspects as well and will be rounding them up soon.'

Mr bin Musa is currently in hospital where his condition is described as critical.
