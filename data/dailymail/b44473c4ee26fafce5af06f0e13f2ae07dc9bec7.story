Six of the most difficult United States counties to live in are in Kentucky, according to a new analysis.

The New York Times' Upshot section examined six factors, including college education, household income, joblessness, disability rates, life expectancy and obesity.

Kentucky's Clay County came in last place in a ranking of 3,135 counties.

In descending order, the most difficult 
counties to live in are Clay County, Kentucky; Jackson County, Kentucky; Leslie 
County, Kentucky; Lee County, Kentucky; Humphreys County, Mississippi; 
East Carroll Parish, Louisiana; Breathitt County, Kentucky; Magoffin 
County, Kentucky; Jefferson County, Georgia; and Lee County, Arkansas.

Life expectancy: Clay County's average life expectancy is just 71.4 years

'Clay County, in dead last, might as well be in a different country,' Annie Lowrie writes for the New York Times' magazine.

Clay County's median household income is $22,296, and its jobless rate is 12.7 percent, she notes. The county also has a 45 percent obesity rate, 11.7 percent disability rate, and life expectancy of 71.4 years.
