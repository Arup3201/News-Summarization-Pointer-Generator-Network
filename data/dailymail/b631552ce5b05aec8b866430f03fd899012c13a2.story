Similarities: A number of parents are concerned because their 'beautiful' girls look just like Suri Cruise and they fear that their daughters will be mistaken for the young star

With the first day of school for Suri Cruise only a week away, the famous youngster has surely planned out what shoes match her new uniform.

But it isn't the dress code that has parents at the elite Avenues school concerned, as they fear that their own children are going to be overwrought with media attention once the school year begins.

'I had two different parents call to tell me their children are beautiful young girls that look like Suri,' education consultant Dana Haddad said.

'The girls will all be in uniforms, and they're worried their daughters will be mistaken for Suri by the paparazzi outside the school,' she told the New York Post's Page Six magazine.

The concern comes from parents who are paying $39,750-per-year to send their children to the brand-new Avenues school which will open next week in the Chelsea highline, just blocks from the apartment where Suri and her mother Katie holmes share since Holmes filed for divorce from ex-husband Tom Cruise.

Aimed at the children of the jetsetting elite 'The World School' enables pupils to follow their parents around the globe without being tied to school vacation schedules.

A source told Life & Style magazine: 'Katie has eagerly been telling Suri all about the lunchrooms, basketball courts and different activities Avenues offers. Suri's really excited about it.'

The imposing school building will have a rooftop playground,  along with a main gym that includes full-size basketball and volleyball courts.

Start of school: Suri will attend Avenues, a brand-new school on Chelsea's high line, which will be one of many that will span five continents allowing children to travel according to their parents schedules

Suri had been expected to attend an exclusive Catholic school but her mother's choice has certain advantages.

The website boasts that it is a step better than 'national' schools such as Britain's Eton.

'If "local" schools are the first step in the evolution of schooling and "national" schools are the second step, the decades ahead are likely to bring the third step: global schools.

'Thirty years from now there will likely be a number of such organizations. Avenues plans to be the best of this new breed of educational institution - hence its subtitle: The World School.'

And with campuses planned for China, India, Africa, Europe, the Americas and Australia Suri will certainly be able to study around the globe.

Along with high academic standards the school claims it will also teach pupils life skills, an advantage to children as sheltered as Suri.

'Avenues will embrace practical matters so often ignored by academic institutions,' it says.

'Students will become comfortable with a variety of life skills, including practical matters such as time management and technological competency.'

The youngster is no stranger to travel, with her father Tom Cruise shuttling her around in his private jet and helicopter.

He is also looking to find a new 'secluded' property in New York, so that he can spend plenty of time with Suri following his divorce from Katie.

A source previously said: 'He wants something extremely secluded where Suri can play without paparazzi watching. There are lots of them in these towns.'

Although the Hollywood superstar is keeping the couple's  former home in Beverly Hills - which he shares with his 17-year-old son Connor - he is determined to have a permanent base in New York for his time with Suri.
