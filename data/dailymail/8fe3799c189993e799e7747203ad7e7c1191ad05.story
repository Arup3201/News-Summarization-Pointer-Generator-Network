The Football Association have opened a full-scale investigation in an attempt to find the culprit who launched a coin at Fabricio Coloccini in Newcastle’s draw with Crystal Palace - and want a lengthy ban for anyone found guilty.

They are working with Crystal Palace and analysing CCTV footage of the Holmesdale End when a member of the crowd, which holds Crystal Palace fans, threw an object which struck Coloccini as he celebrated Newcastle’s goal.

Crystal Palace stewards and staff at the club will also be questioned to provide eye-witness accounts of what happened.

Fortunately for the Argentine the coin did not hit him in the eye and he played the full 90 minutes

The Metropolitan Police are also investigating, but did not make any arrests on the night of the game.

The FA want anyone found guilty of the offence to face a lengthy ban from the game.

A similar incident happened last season when Wayne Rooney was pelted by objects from the same stand at Selhurst Park.

Provided clubs provide adequate stewarding for their matches and have CCTV to monitor any disturbances, the FA feel it is impossible to stop fans from turning up and throwing objects from the stands.

Newcastle manager John Carver claimed afterwards that the coin could have left his player blinded.

‘I have seen it and it misses Colo’s eye by an inch – another inch and it could blind him, Carver said. ‘You can’t have that in this game. I hope the authorities deal with it and I’m sure they will because it will be on TV every other minute and rightly so. Let’s find out who it was and sort it out.

‘It just can’t happen, can it? It has got to be taken out of the game. What is disappointing from Palace’s point of view is that they have an unbelievable crowd here, an unbelievable atmosphere – it is a fanatical group of supporters in that corner. But it takes one idiot to throw a coin.’
