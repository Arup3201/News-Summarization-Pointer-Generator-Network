Walmart
 heiress Paige Laurie Dubbert's ex-husband has claimed she's a cheater who 
is trying to distract attention from her affair by accusing him of stealing thousands of dollars from her.

Patrick Bode Dubbert accused his wife of six years and high school sweetheart of cheating last year, he claimed.

The Walmart heiress, 32, filed for divorce on March 7 citing irreconcilable differences. The unhappy heiress also filed a civil lawsuit where she accuses her husband of stealing thousands of dollars from their Malibu retail center business.

Paige and Bo, (pictured right with Walmart executive Richard Thomas) dated during their senior year of high school and married at a top-secret wedding in Columbia, Missouri, in June 2008. The couple are now in the midst of an embittered divorce

The lawsuit alleged that Bo convinced his wife to let him hire a friend as co-manager, then the two men made 
themselves general contractors and upped their salaries to $70,000 a 
month.

She also alleged that her husband also paid himself $250,000 a year to manage the project on top of the other fees.

According to legal documents seen by TMZ, Mr Dubbert says that his estranged wife is simply trying to deflect from her alleged wrongdoing to 'spin an image of Paige to the media as a victim'.

A source close to Paige told MailOnline today: 'This is a pathetic and desperate attempt to use a completely baseless claim to try to smear Paige.

'This totally unsubstantiated false fabrication of an alleged affair is simply a desperate attempt by Bo to divert attention away from the actual substance and reality of the case to try to grab as much money as possible.'

The couple married at a top-secret wedding in Columbia, Missouri at the family home in June 2008.

According to blog Shabina Says So, the nuptials took place in two mammoth tents - one which resembled a cathedral for the ceremony and the second with velvet walls for the reception.

The bride wore two couture wedding gowns, one by Carolina Herrera and the second evening dress by Jenny Packham. It was attended by 600 guests and the partying went on until 6am.

The young couple had signed a prenup which not only protected her fortune, but also 
provided her husband with the right to spousal support if they ever 
divorced.

Paige isn't contesting that amount that she agreed to pay, reports TMZ and plans to change her name back to Elizabeth Paige Laurie.

She is the daughter of Nancy Walton Lawrie, the youngest daughter of Bud Walton, the brother and business partner of Walmart founder Sam Walton.

Nancy and her sister Ann Walton Kroenke between them own a stake in the retail behemoth worth more than $6 billion.

Mother and daughter caused controversy in 2004 when they made a $25 million naming rights gift towards the building of a new $75 million basketball arena at the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri.

Nancy and her husband Bill Lawrie decided to name the facility Paige Sports Arena after their daughter.

Neither 
parents nor daughter had ever attended the university, instead Paige 
graduated that year from the University of Southern California.

A former roommate told ABC’s 20/20 that she had been paid $20,000 over four years to do Paige's homework for her.

Once the allegations emerged, Paige’s parents agreed to let the school rename the arena which is now known as Mizzou Arena. In 2005 Paige voluntarily surrendered her USC communication degree.

Paige and Bo first met back in high school during an ACT prep course and dated briefly during their senior year of high school. 

Four years later they bumped into each other at an LA nightclub and rekindled their romance. Bo proposed to Paige in December 2006.
