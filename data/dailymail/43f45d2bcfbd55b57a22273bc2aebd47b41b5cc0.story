Louis van Gaal clearly favours the 3-5-2 system and has implemented the formation since taking over at Manchester United earlier this summer.

Defenders Chris Smalling, Phil Jones and Jonny Evans started as the back three during the penalty shoot-out victory over Inter Milan on Tuesday during Van Gaal's third game in charge.

Are these the three who could be the foundation for the Red Devils' title challenge next term? Many Man United supporters would suggest not.

VIDEO Van Gaal looking for defensive reinforcements 

Van Gaal, who guided the likes of Ron Vlaar, Daley Blind and Bruno Martins Indi through the World Cup as Holland went unbeaten in normal time, is keen to use three centre-backs at Old Trafford this season.

With the new desired system taking shape during United's friendlies over in America, the Dutchman is likely to look for defensive reinforcements before the transfer window closes next month in a bid to improve the club's backline.

Having lost the seasoned defensive duo of Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic this summer, the Red Devils lack an experienced head at the back.

Should the United boss decide to dip his toe into the transfer market, here are six defenders for him to consider.

Thomas Vermaelen

Club: Arsenal

Value: £12m

The 28-year-old Belgian offers cover in the left-back position as well as at centre-back. Ideal for Van Gaal's plans.

Versatile: Arsenal's Belgium defender Thomas Vermaelen can play as a centre-back as well as at left-back

Mats Hummels

Club: Borussia Dortmund

Value: £30m

His father Hermann has ruled out Manchester United but they may still give it a try. Lacks pace but puts his body on the line.

Daley Blind

Club: Ajax

Value: £17m

Versatile defender can play left-back, wing-back or in midfield. Not the quickest but is clever and possesses good distribution skills.

Joel Veltman

Club: Ajax

Value: £18m

Up and coming centre-back who all of Europe's top scouts are monitoring. Was in Van Gaal's World Cup squad.

Young talent: Ajax centre-back Joel Veltman was in Van Gaal's Holland squad and would cost £18million

Joao Miranda

Club: Atletico Madrid

Value: £25m

Chelsea are very keen as are Barcelona and they have made offers. Not great value at 29 but a wily defender.

Competition: Atletico Madrid defender Joao Miaranda is wanted by Chelsea and Barcelona

Raphael Varane

Club: Real Madrid

Value: £35m

The one everyone wants but will Real sell? Tall, athletic and young. Tipped to be the best defender in Europe.

Big future: France centre-back Raphael Varane has been tipped to be the best defender in Europe
