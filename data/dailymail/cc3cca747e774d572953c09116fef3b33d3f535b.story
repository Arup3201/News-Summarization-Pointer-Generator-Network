With a country to run, an economy to fix and a coalition to keep together, David Cameron has his work cut out.

Now the Prime Minister is about to get his very own iPad app to help him keep on top of it all – with a price tag of around £20,000 for the taxpayer.

At a glance, Mr Cameron will be able to keep up to date with all the latest information from across Government on his ‘management dashboard’.

The application – tailor made for the PM
– will produce data on polling, unemployment figures, NHS waiting lists
and movements in the markets with just the touch of an iPad screen.

It will also give ‘real time’ news feeds from Google, Twitter and other 
outlets so the Prime Minister can keep up to date with events in the UK 
and around the world. Computer programmers inside the Cabinet Office 
have been working for the past few months on developing the personalised
application.

According to reports, the cost of producing the software 
is estimated to have hit £20,000.

Mr Cameron, an avid iPad user, already employs the tablet device to read
newspapers and political news websites, and listens to radio programmes
from the BBC and other channels on it over wi-fi.

The Prime Minister also uses his iPad to relax and takes it on flights 
where he catches up with episodes of U.S. series Desperate Housewives 
and Danish drama The Killing.

Mr Cameron and George Osborne have also both admitted to being fans of 
Angry Birds – a highly addictive app which involves using a catapult to 
fire birds at pigs and other objects.

The Prime Minister recently boasted that he had completed every level of the game.

At the time, Andy Payne of the Association for UK Interactive 
Entertainment, who met Mr Cameron to discuss gaming, said: ‘He 
absolutely loves it. He wants to know what other top games he should get
for his iPad.’

The idea for a personalised application came from his advisers after a trip to the U.S.

Unlike his predecessor Gordon Brown, who
had a secure e-mail address linked with the government network, Mr 
Cameron prefers to receive papers on which he can write notes which can 
then be reviewed by staff

Although the software has been developed specifically for the Prime 
Minister, sources say it will be made available more widely within 
Government. But one quipped: ‘It certainly won’t have the country’s 
nuclear codes on it.’

However, Matthew Sinclair, director of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: 
‘There are already a number of official and independent initiatives 
under way to make Government data easier to access from a range of 
different devices.

‘For the Cabinet Office to set out to make a special app for the Prime 
Minister, even if it might eventually find its way out so that the wider
public can use it, seems like both a distraction and a waste of money.’

MPs and peers are now allowed to use iPads in the House of Commons and 
House of Lords and at least a dozen MPs have already bought them on 
expenses, spending around £15 a month each on data charges.
