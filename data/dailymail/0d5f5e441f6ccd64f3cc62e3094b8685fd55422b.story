A brutal head wound during a botched robbery left a brilliant, young Washington D.C. policy analyst with such debilitating brain damage that he now struggles to read his 2-year-old son children's books.

Thomas 'TC' Maslin, 30, still retains much of his cognitive function, but the injury last year left him all but unable speak, blind in one eye and with limited motor function in one arm and one leg.

Before the head trauma, he was an aggressive, career-driven Washington operative, who had risen to associate director for environmental policy at IHS, a major consulting firm, the Washington Post reports.

Happy family: TC Maslin and wife Abby are seen here with their son Jack before the attack. TC had a high-flying career as a policy analyst

After: Mr Maslin lost the sight in one eye, the much of the use of his right arm and right leg and significant amounts of his cognitive function

Now, he struggles to read books meant for a second-grader. 

Mr Maslin's heartbreaking transformation has taken a toll on his 
faithful wife Abby - who has stuck by his side throughout the trying 
ordeal.

'Five little ducks went out one day. Over the hills and far away. The woman duck said quack, quack, quack,' he read aloud at a recent rehabilitation appointment.

His instructor stops him and tells him to read it again.

'The mother duck said quack, quack, quack,' he corrects himself.

On another occasion, he boasted that he had made a load from bread 'from trash.' The term he was looking for was, of course, 'from scratch.'

Mrs Maslin, an English teacher, writes on her blog that the brain trauma 'catapulted us to the grayest of places: that space between life and death. If life is freedom and death is finality, we find ourselves stuck in that torturous place somewhere in the middle.'

Mr Maslin's recovery has been painfully slow. He still struggles to read even children's books to his young son Jack

Mr Maslin was attacked and hit in the back of the head with an aluminum baseball bat during a botched robbery last August

The couple, facing $1million in medical bills, now travels to Halifax, Nova Scotia, regularly so Mr Maslin can undergo special therapy. 

He refuses to talk about the attack that left him disabled.

Three days after the Maslin couple's third wedding anniversary, Mr Maslin was walking home near from a bar after a few drinks with friends following a Washington Nationals game.

Three men approached and demanded his money. He was handing over his iPhone and debit card when one of the men smashed him in the back of the head with an aluminum baseball bat, according to police.

Tommy Branch, 23, who was later arrested for assault, called the bat his 'Barry Bonds.' Police say he wound up and hit Mr Maslin in the head with a two-fisted grip on the bat.

Mr and Mrs Maslin are struggling to cope with the recovery, but they remain optimistic that Mr Maslin - and life - will improve

Branch was sentenced to 24 years in prison earlier this year.

The brutal blow shattered Mr Maslin's skull and severed his optic nerve. He lay unconscious on the street for eight hours while he bled internally.

After a coma that lasted for days, he was left blind in one eye and with limited use of his right arm and right leg. Half his skull remains noticeably collapsed. 

But, he and his wife remain optimistic of his chances of recovery.

'I’m alive. For God’s sake. That’s good,' Mr Maslin told the Post.
