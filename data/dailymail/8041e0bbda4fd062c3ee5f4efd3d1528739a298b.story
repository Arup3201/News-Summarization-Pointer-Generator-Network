The Chilcot report into the Iraq War has been held up by Tony Blair and must be published soon, Nick Clegg said yesterday.

The Deputy Prime Minister said that senior figures likely to be criticised by the inquiry should push for the report to be released – nearly five years after the probe was launched and three years after the final witness gave evidence.

He spoke out amid reports that the process of declassifying documents to be published by Sir John Chilcot, including Mr Blair’s correspondence with President George W Bush before the war, has stalled.

Cabinet Office officials yesterday insisted that the declassifications will be completed ‘soon’.

But only after that will inquiry chairman Sir John begin the so-called ‘Maxwellisation’ process of warning figures like Mr Blair, Gordon Brown and former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw that they face criticism over the decision to go to war.

Mr Clegg yesterday expressed his frustration at the lengthy delays and suggested Mr Blair is to blame – a claim denied by the former prime minister’s office.

At a press conference in Westminster, he said: ‘Clearly I think everybody would like for the Chilcot inquiry to be published.

‘I really hope now that everybody involved, including those who know they will be subject to renewed scrutiny, will now accept that it is time.

‘This was one of the most momentous decisions in British foreign policy... It is quite right that as a country we understand the truth.’

A report yesterday suggested that Sir John’s review may not be produced until next year, potentially making Iraq an issue in the 2015 general election campaign – something that concerns Labour leader Ed Miliband, who has sought to distance his party from the Blair years.

But last week Mr Blair denied knowledge of the reason for the delays, telling a journalist: ‘I don’t know anything more than you do.’ 

His spokesman acknowledged Mr Clegg’s reference, adding that he is ‘completely wrong’ if he believes Mr Blair is responsible for the delay.
