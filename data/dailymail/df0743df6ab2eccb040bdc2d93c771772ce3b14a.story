Magma levels are slowly rebuilding inside Mount St. Helens, a volcano in Washington state around 100 miles south of Seattle, that erupted in 1980 and killed 57 people

The roughly 8,300-foot volcano erupted in an explosion of hot ash and gas on May 18, 1980, spewing debris over some 230 square miles and causing more than a billion dollars in property damage.

U.S. scientists say there is no sign of an impending eruption and the volcano has been quiet in recent years.

Entire forests were crushed and river systems altered in the blast, which began with a 5.2 magnitude earthquake.

Within minutes, the north face of the symmetrical peak collapsed, spewing volcanic ash and unleashing rivers of hot  mud and scorching pumice that obliterated everything in their path.

The violent eruption lasted nine hours, causing catastrophic damage to the surrounding area and claiming 57 lives.

'The magma reservoir beneath Mount St. Helens has been slowly re-pressurizing since 2008,' the U.S. Geological Survey said in a statement on Wednesday.

Monitoring: Since the end of the 2004-2008 eruptions at Mount St. Helens, scientists at the Cascades Volcano Observatory and the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network have been monitoring the subtle inflation of the ground surface and minor earthquakes

'It is likely that re-pressurization is caused by (the) arrival of a small amount of additional magma 4 to 8 km (2.5 to 5 miles) beneath the surface.'

The USGS said this is to be expected with an active volcano and does not indicate 'the volcano is likely to erupt anytime soon.'

Helicopter pilot Major Jeffrey R. Linscott recalls flying into the volcano before it erupted in 2004. He says the volcano is monitored by GPS telemetry and seismic systems as well as other sensors that tracks carbon dioxide and thermal temperatures. 

'I flew into the crater and noticed the same area we had landed the previous day was fractured. It was a startling and troubling observation,' Linscott told CBS News.

'The monitoring stations measured a deformation in the flanks of the volcano as the magma was raising to the surface. Not long after that, the volcano erupted.'

'This is giving long-term (data) that it's getting ready to erupt again, but it could be decades before it does something again," Moran said. "It's getting ready, but it's not there. The reassuring thing is: when it's really ready to erupt, it gives lots and lots of signs.'

The USGS, and the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network at University of Washington, closely monitor ground deformation and seismicity at the volcano.

This summer, they will also measure its released gases and gravity field, measurements that can be used to monitor subsurface magma and forecast eruptions.
