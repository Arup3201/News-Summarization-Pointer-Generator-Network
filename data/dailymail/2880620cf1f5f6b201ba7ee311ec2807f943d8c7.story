While some may say never work with children or animals, photographer Brad Wilson decided to ignore this pearl of wisdom.

The snapper wanted to work with something 'a little less predictable' and certainly achieved that, by bringing in hungry wild animals and taking their portrait.

Mr Wilson brought in hungry mountain lions, cheetahs and orangutans, who were trained not to attack humans, and using their favourite types of food managed to take their photograph in a studio by rewarding them with snacks.

He began by calling wildlife sanctuaries and handlers that provide animals for Hollywood movies, he told Petapixel.

The photographer based in Santa Fe, New Mexico, said the most difficult part was 'pre-production' of his ambitious idea.

He said: 'Trying to find the animals I could bring into the studio, find the right trainers to come with these animals, and even just to find a space that could contain an elephant, contain a giraffe - and that was a big part of it.'

Once he had the animals he needed, he signed large insurance policies and liability contracts so, if an animal died during a shoot, Mr Wilson owed $500,000, the website reported.

He says, technically, the animals are considered trained, although 'not trained in the sense that a dog is trained... They are basically trained to not come out on to the set and try to attack you; beyond that, they are really going to do what they want to do.'

He would allow them to sit on the set - sometimes while held by their trainer - and then inch up until he managed to take the perfect picture of them.

He said despite the chaos around the situation, he aimed to find the perfect moment where he captured the animal.

The photographer wanted to achieve a sense of isolation with his wild subjects, he told the website.

The images - entitled Affinity - were the stunning results of his work, giving a close up view more normally gleaned from zoom lenses in the wild - all from a 90Ã—120-foot sound stage in a Los Angeles studio lot.
