A fire chief who swapped explicit pornographic pictures of
children was promoted and given a pay rise while he was awaiting trial.

William Wyllie, 49, was suspended from his £46,900 job as a
manager by Cumbria Fire Service after his arrest in October 2011.

The married father had been leading a bizarre double life,
swapping indecent images of children and cruising gay dating websites.

Disgraced: Fire chief William Wyllie, 49, collected a promotion and £70,000 in pay from Cumbria Fire Service as he awaited trial on charges of distributing sexually explicit pictures of children

He protested his innocence, which meant he could legally
claim his full pay throughout his suspension, and even received a pay increase
when he was promoted.

However, he dramatically changed his plea to guilty a
day-and-a-half into his trial last month.

Altogether Wyllie is understood to have pocketed around
£70,000 from the public purse during his suspension.

He is still being paid until today, the day his resignation
takes effect, even though he pleaded guilty more than a month ago.

Last night Matthew Sinclair of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said:
‘Taxpayers will be astounded that someone could be given a promotion and pay
rise while suspended from his job.

‘The fact that Wyllie ended up admitting his guilt, but not
before trousering tens of thousands of pounds while awaiting trial, will only
add to people’s anger.

‘Whoever was responsible for approving the pay rise and
promotion must be held to account for what amounts to a disgusting waste of
taxpayers’ money.’

Lancaster Crown Court heard that Wyllie, of Barrow, sent
indecent images of children to London-based prolific HIV-positive paedophile
Steven King, who was jailed in 2011 for four years for arranging to have sex
with children as young as five.

As a result of the King investigation, Wyllie’s
home and car were searched and laptops, mobile phones and sim cards were
seized.

He initially denied nine charges relating to distributing
and encouraging the making of indecent images of children.

The jury were told Wyllie claimed the material had been sent
by a malicious hacker attempting to ‘get him in trouble’.

But on the second day of his trial he admitted three charges
of sending indecent images of children, two offences of sending indecent moving
images of children and one charge of publishing an obscene article.

He was sentenced to a three-year community order, which will
involve three years’ supervision and a sex offender treatment programme.

He will be on the sex offenders’ register for five years and
subject to a sexual offences prevention order for the same period.

Wyllie started working for Cumbria Fire and Rescue Service
in 2005 after moving from Greenock in Strathclyde where he was working as a
fireman.

Cumbria County Council said 
he was given his promotion as part 
of a force-wide restructuring programme.

Wyllie was working as a temporary group manager when he was
suspended and was given an incremental pay increase when his title was made
permanent.

Adrian Buckle, Cumbria’s assistant chief fire officer, said
Wyllie was promoted as part of a cost-saving process.

He said: ‘As a result of this process, William Wyllie was
substantively appointed into the temporary role that he was undertaking when
originally suspended.’

When contacted Wyllie declined to apologise for claiming his
salary,  saying: ‘I do not have any
comment  to make.’
