Dublin has been voted one of the friendliest cities on the planet.

The Irish capital was ranked fifth in the top 10 of the world's most welcoming urban destinations, by readers of Conde Nast Traveller. 

Rising eight places from the 13th most friendly city last year, it shares the position in the popularity stakes with Sydney, Australia.

The luck of the Irish: Dubliners are considered one of the most friendliest in the world 

The top spots included Auckland, New Zealand; Melbourne, Australia; Victoria, Canada; and Charleston in South Carolina, US.

Only two European cities made it into the top 10 - the other being Seville in Spain - compiled from the findings of the magazine's readers choice survey.

Dublin is described as a 'vibrant city' and, in a nod to its literary fame, as a 'bibliophile's dream'.

Dublin is 'the kind of place you stop in for a drink in a local pub, only to end up chatting with the locals for the next five hours' 

1. Auckland, New Zealand

2. Melbourne, Australia

3. Victoria, BC, Canada

4. Charleston, South Carolina, US

5. Dublin, Ireland

5. Sydney, Australia

7. Siem Reap, Cambodia

8. Cape Town, South Africa

9. Savannah, Georgia, US

10. Seville, Spain

It was also noted for being 'green, lush and very walkable' and 'the kind of place you stop in for a drink in a local pub, only to end up chatting with the locals for the next five hours'.

The magazine also references US first lady Michelle Obama's trip to Dublin with her daughters last year when she was photographed with Bono at his local pub.

Niall Gibbons, chief executive of Tourism Ireland, said the city's high ranking came as no surprise.

'Again and again, our research shows us that the friendliness of our people is one of our unique selling points,' he said.

'It is the warm welcome and the 'craic' here that resonates with our overseas visitors and makes Dublin and Ireland such a great choice for a short break or holiday.'

'The people are friendly, and their humour and view on life is something to aspire to attain': Auckland, New Zealand, shares first place with Melbourne as the friendliest city in the world

Johannesburg in South Africa was named as the least friendliest city in the Conde Nast Traveller survey

Other cities making up the most friendly list are Siem Reap, Cambodia; Cape Town, South Africa; Savannah, Georgia; and finally Seville.

The poll also named the most unfriendly cities in the world as Johannesburg, South Africa; Cannes, France; Moscow, Russia; as well as Paris and Marseille, also in France.

The worst 10 also included Beijing, China; Frankfurt, Germany; Milan, Italy; Monte Carlo, Monaco; and Nassau, Bahamas.
