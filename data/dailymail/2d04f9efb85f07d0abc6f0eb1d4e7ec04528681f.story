George Boyd is not expecting Brendan Rodgers to follow suit any time soon but admits that he quit as Liverpool boss on the Football Manager video game after seeing his team slump to fifth place.

In reality, Rodgers’s side are languishing in 10th position off the back of last season’s narrow title miss and play Burnley at Turf Moor on Boxing Day with the Northern Irishman’s future at Anfield still in question.

However, Boyd is convinced Rodgers will eventually get it right despite Liverpool’s current malaise.

‘There are about 15 of the boys who play (the video game),’ said the Burnley midfielder. ‘A few of us chose Liverpool to see who could do the best with them. I’m struggling. I think I’m fifth now. I got bored so I’ve started a new game and gone down to Stevenage.

‘I’m not saying I’m better than him though! He’s a top manager. He proved that last year with how close Liverpool were.

‘They spent a lot of money in the summer and it will take time, but you see what a top quality coach he is.

Boyd and Burnley have enjoyed an upturn in fortunes over the past month

‘They’ve just been on a bit of a blip but the class is always there and it will come through in the end. I won’t be knocking on his door any time soon.’

Boyd played in Hull’s shock 3-1 win over Liverpool last December and has bought into Burnley’s work ethic since arriving in a £3million move in the summer. 

Last month it was revealed that he ran further than any other Premier League player in a single game this season, covering more than eight miles in Burnley’s win at Stoke.

‘It’s something I’ve prided myself on throughout my career but I think it’s more evident in this team because everyone works so hard,’ said Boyd.

Boyd has been going the extra mile - literally - to help Burnley's survival scrap

‘If you’ve been down in the lower leagues you don’t want to go back there so you work even harder to stay at this level. Everyone in the squad is enjoying it and doesn’t want it to stop.

‘Our game is about pressing and getting in people’s faces. We’ll try to disrupt Liverpool and play our own game.

‘They have spent so much money and we need to close the gap. If work-rate is the way to do that then so be it. We haven’t got £30m to go and buy strikers so we work hard to make it an even playing field.’
