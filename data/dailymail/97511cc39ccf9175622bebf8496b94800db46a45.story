Pay cut? Alan Hansen is going to broker a deal to saty on Match Of The Day

Match of The Day’s team of highly paid pundits are facing drastic reductions in their salaries as part of the BBC’s economy drive.

Alan Hansen has agreed to take a £500,000-a-year pay cut when he signs his new contract in the next few days.

And it is understood that Alan Shearer, Mark Lawrenson and Lee Dixon – along with presenter Gary Lineker – will also face salary reductions when they discuss new deals.

Hansen’s pay has been the subject of controversy after it was revealed he was earning £1.5million a year for his comments. £500,000 would represent a 33 per cent pay cut.

Sources have suggested that the former Scotland international ‘voluntarily’ agreed to the reduction, saying that he was no different from Sir Bruce Forsyth  or Graham Norton in having to ‘stomach’ big salary drops.

They said he ‘didn’t complain’ and was keen to stay on, adding that compared with most people in the industry he was still ‘on a very good deal’.

It is understood that Lineker, who is thought to be on about £2million, does not come up for contract renewal until August next year. Again it is expected he will follow suit with a significant reduction to his deal.

The other pundits are expected to face cuts of about 20 per cent because they are paid less – Shearer is believed to be on £500,000 a year.

The revelation that Hansen was receiving about £40,000 per show angered viewers and politicians. BBC director general Mark Thompson has tried to defend the deal by comparing Hansen to top TV entertainers of the past, such as Morecambe and Wise.

But it would appear there is a growing realisation that defending such high pay is hard to sustain when the BBC is facing 20 per cent cuts and getting rid of about 2,000 jobs.

A source said: ‘On-screen talent is not immune to economic pressures facing the BBC.’

Life for Hansen, Lawrenson and Shearer has been made easier with Match Of The Day’s recent move  to Salford.

Both Hansen and Lawrenson live in the North West, while Shearer’s home is in the North East, although it is less convenient for Lineker, who is based in the South East.

Not alone: Jeremy Paxman and Graham Norton have also been asked to take pay cuts in cost cutting measures
