One of the daredevils arrested for BASE-jumping off the One World Trade Center worked on construction of the tower.

James Brady, 32, was pictured installing a steel beam with president Obama’s signature on the One WTC’s 104th floor in January last year.

Today, Mr Brady was accused of smuggling in the gear the group used to carry out the death-defying stunt in the early hours of September 30 last year.

Captured: Police allegedly seized the GoPro video of the BASE jump during a search of the four men's home last month, and it was not posted online until yesterday

Spreading fast: The five-minute video was uploaded to YouTube on Monday and has had more than 185,000 views in less than 24 hours

‘This is an inside person who 
apparently went rogue for his own self-glorification,’ a law enforcement
 source told the New York Post.

The
 ironworker and his three companions were arrested yesterday after 
handing themselves in following a police investigation into their stunt 
in September last year.

Mr 
Brady and two friends, Andrew Rossig and Marko Markovich, BASE-jumped 
off the One World Trade Center’s Freedom Tower while another man, named 
as Kyle Hartwell, allegedly served as a lookout.

Mr Rossig said the jumpers got in simply by walking through a gap in a fence, however a law enforcement source disputed that account.

He said Mr Brady used his work access to secret his parachuting pals into the site, a statement Mr Brady's attorney denied.

The jump was filmed with a GoPro camera and was posted on YouTube yesterday as the men handed themselves over to the NYPD.

The
 video, which shows the three jumping off the Freedom Tower and landing 
in front of the nearby Goldman Sachs building, has had more than 185,000
 views in less than 24 hours.

The
 NYPD said last fall that investigators were looking for two 
parachutists in dark jumpsuits seen floating near the building around 
3am on September 30, but did not signal that arrests were imminent until
 a New Jersey teenager was arrested for trespassing at the WTC last 
week.

The group, Mr Brady, 
from Kings Park, New York,  Mr Rossig, 33, from Slate Hill, New York,  
Mr Markovich, 27, from Lake Ronkonkoma, New York and Mr Hartwell, 29, 
from East Patchogue, New York, handed themselves in yesterday.

They
 face charges of burglary and trespassing as well as misdemeanor 
reckless endangerment and misdemeanor jumping from a structure.

Mr Rossig said the jump was ‘very exhilarating,’ as he and co-defendant Mr Brady headed to a police precinct 
to surrender on Monday.

‘It's a fair 
amount of free-fall time,’ he said. ‘You really get to enjoy the view of
 the city and see it from a different perspective.’

Mr Rossig,
 an avid BASE jumper said the skydivers took care to keep from endangering anyone, 
choosing a time when streets would be largely deserted.

NYPD
 searched the four men’s homes last month and seized the GoPro video of 
the jump, Mr Rossig's attorney Timothy Parlatore said. However authorities did not signal that arrests were imminent until 16-year-old Justin
 Casquejo's arrest last week, which is when they surrendered.

Mr Markovich's attorney, Joseph Corozzo, said his client 
was a ‘very responsible individual’ and highly trained parachuting 
instructor.

Good cause: All proceeds made from the video will be donated to charity, the group has said

‘He has an 
impeccable background, and I just hope that he's not turned into some 
form of a scapegoat for the Port Authority's shortcomings’ in security', Mr 
Corozzo said.

Police Commissioner William Bratton said the investigation was a joint endeavor by the NYPD and the Port Authority police.

‘These
 men violated the law and placed themselves, as well as others, in 
danger,’ PC Bratton said.

‘These arrests should send a message to anyone 
thinking about misusing a landmark this way. They will be tracked down 
and they will face serious charges. Being a thrill-seeker does not give 
immunity from the law.’

The
 NYPD devotes more than 200 officers, surveillance cameras and other 
technology to protect the perimeter of the site, while Port Authority 
police and private security agents guard the inside. Ultimately, plans 
call for a $40 million system of barriers and checkpoints around the 
16-acre trade center site.

This is the second criminal case in two weeks arising from surreptitious stunts at the nation's tallest skyscraper.

Justin
 Casquejo, 16, from New Jersey was arrested on a misdemeanour 
trespassing charge after slipping through a gap in a fence, using a lift
 and sneaking past a sleeping security guard to spend about two hours 
atop the 1,776-foot-tall tower earlier this month.

The
 incidents have raised questions about security at the lower Manhattan 
site, which is supposed to be one of the most tightly protected in the 
country. The site is owned by the Port Authority of New York and New 
Jersey.
