By common consensus, Calum Chambers was rinsed by Swansea winger Jefferson Montero during Arsenal’s 2-1 defeat at the Liberty Stadium last Sunday.

A day later he joined up with the England squad, preparing for a Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia on Saturday and the friendly at Celtic Park against Scotland on Tuesday. There is no respite.

The idea was to protect this kid, to nurture one of the genuine talents in the game. Instead we are hell bent on burning him out.

A weary Calum Chambers was given a roasting by Jefferson Montero at Swansea on Sunday

Chambers' recovery time (in days) between matches at Southampton last season:

7, 7, 15, 9, 12, 31, 7, 8, 4, 3, 3, 17, 10, 4, 7, 3, 11, 7, 22, 6, 7, 7, 30.

His recovery time between matches for Arsenal and England this season: 

6, 3, 4, 4, 4, 3, 10, 7, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 10, 3, 6, 3, 5. 

For a 19-year-old, making his way in the game after a £16m move from Southampton in the summer, he is playing an awful lot of football. Way too much football, as it happens.

Last year, when he was in and out of the Saints team, interchanging at right back with Nathaniel Clyne, he played 1,821 minutes of first-team football in the entire season.

Four months into his career at Arsenal, playing for one of the top clubs in England and the national team’s new right back, he has already played 1,535 minutes for club and country. It is too much.

Last season, his first full season since he graduated from the academy at St Mary’s, Chambers averaged a game every 12.5 days for Southampton.

This is his recovery time, in days, between games at Southampton last season: 7, 7, 15, 9, 12, 31, 7, 8, 4, 3, 3, 17, 10, 4, 7, 3, 11, 7, 22, 6, 7, 7, 30.

Those spells out of the team gave Chambers time to recover, allowing his body to develop and to acclimatise to life as a top class professional athlete.

This year, playing for a team that had ambitions to win either the Barclays Premier League or Champions League at the start of the season, he gets a game every 4.6 days on average. That’s ridiculous.

Here is Chambers’ recovery time, in days, as an Arsenal and England player between matches: 6, 3, 4, 4, 4, 3, 10, 7, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 10, 3, 6, 3, 5.

He is being played round the clock for club and country.

Chambers on his England debut against Norway in September - he has now won three caps

Since he played in the 3-0 victory over Manchester City in the Community Shield at Wembley on August 10, Chambers has appeared in 16 Arsenal games. Five of them have been in the Champions League.

Throw in his England debut, a nine-minute appearance against Norway on September 3, and the figure rises to 17.

Then add on his first start against San Marino at Wembley, plus the trip to Estonia a few days later and we’re up to 19. Too many.

Before Chambers arrived at Arsenal in the summer, he had made 25 appearances in his entire professional career: 24 last season, trading places with Clyne when Mauricio Pochettino saw fit, and one the year before.

He was at St George’s Park on Tuesday, playfully patting his England team-mate Luke Shaw’s stomach and teasing him about his summer excesses.

2013-14 - Southampton

Matches: 24

Minutes played: 1,821

2014-15 - Arsenal and England

Matches: 20

Minutes played: 1,535

Shaw, also 19, has played a lot of football, too. After breaking into Southampton’s first team he made 28 appearances in his first season.

Last year, before his £31m move to Manchester United, he played 41 times for Southampton.

At the time he looked like he could go on for ever. This season, after travelling to the World Cup with England, he has struggled to recover from injury. It will take time to rediscover his best form.

Chambers has to be given time too, particularly after his punishing schedule for Arsenal and England.

Think back to a time when Rio Ferdinand was coming through at West Ham in the mid-Nineties and it is a world away from the demands being placed in front of Chambers.

Ferdinand was used sparingly at first, called into the England squad with Frank Lampard before Euro 96 to train with the team and give the pair experience of the elite level.

Chambers leaps above Danny Rose for Southampton last season, when he had much more recovery time

The idea, a brainchild of Terry Venables, was to show two promising players what is in front of them if they continued to develop.

Both went on to have long and enduring careers for club and country, but too much is being asked of Chambers at such an early stage of his career.

Naturally he wants to play, but there is no time to learn when he is being asked to play at the very highest level of the game, on average, every 4-and-a-half days.

Think back to August, when he was voted Arsenal’s player of the month and looked assured and accomplished in the heart of that defence.

With the right guidance, he can play like that every week.
