Karen Kay, from Hull, East Yorkshire, has said her son Jason is now too afraid to have a shower after the lesson at Eastfield Primary School

Primary school children as young as nine have been left terrified of the bathroom after their teacher played them an audio clip from the shower scene of Alfred Hitchcock's 1960s film Psycho.

Pupils at Eastfield Primary School, in Hull, were played the clip from the dramatic scene as part of a lesson on how to 'establish mood created by music'.

But Karen Kay, from Hull, East Yorkshire, has said her son Jason is now too afraid to have a shower and will not go to the toilet without taking a plastic sword with him.

She said: 'I am absolutely disgusted and shocked any teacher would feel this is appropriate.

'Jason has become scared stiff and will not go to sleep on his own.

'He now feels he has to take his plastic sword and knife with him every time he takes a shower or goes to the toilet.

'He is always asking an adult to guard the door while he does whatever he has to do in the bathroom.

'The music to the murder scene is scary and Jason has said the children heard the woman screaming and the body falling in the shower. It’s horrific.

'This has had a massive impact on the way he thinks and I am furious with the school.'

The school, in west Hull, said the purpose of the lesson was to 'establish mood created by music'.

It has since apologised and says it is reviewing the type of music it plays to children in the future.

But Ms Kay said: 'I’ve spoken to other parents about it outside school and they just can’t believe it.

Alfred Hitchcock's classic 1960 suspense thrilled Psycho is ranked among the greatest films of all time.

Based on the 1959 novel of the same name by Robert Bloch and reportedly loosely inspired by the crimes of Wisconsin murderer and grave robber Ed Gein, the story centres on the encounter between secretary Marion Crane and motel owner-manager Norman Bates.

Crane, played by Janet Leigh, has ended up at the motel after stealing $40,000 from her employer's client before going on the run.

The murder scene in the shower, featuring screeching violins to dramatic effect, has become one of the best known scenes in cinematic history.

'I have to literally drag Jason in the shower now and it’s all because of this.

'My message to the school would be for it to look hard at the material it is using and see whether the content matches the age group of the children.

'I don’t mind admitting that I get a bit scared when I hear or see any type of murder scene, so it is no wonder Jason is so frightened - he’s only nine.'

Katie Beal, headteacher at Eastfield Primary School, said: 'We have apologised to Jason’s mum and have looked to review the type of music played within lessons in the future.

'The purpose of the lesson was to establish mood created by music and short sound-only clips of film music were played to children to do this.

'References to the films including descriptions and any dialogue were not disclosed, although some of the children did try to guess the film.'
