Mexican authorities say they have detained six police officers over the death of a U.S. man, who died in their custody after being arrested for disorderly conduct in the resort city of Playa del Carmen.

Quintana Roo state Assistant Attorney General Carlos Alvarez said Friday that Yeudi Estrada Carrero died Wednesday inside a patrol truck while three police officers restrained him.

Alvarez says the 28-year-old fitness instructor died of asphyxiation after at least one of the officers pressed his foot against Estrada's neck.

Alvarez says Estrada's body was turned over to his father, who also lives in Cancun.

An investigation is underway.
