A family fear they could be torn apart after the Panamanian wife of a British man was denied a permanent visa.

John Dennis moved back to the UK last year after marrying his wife Ana Maria in Panama and the couple's four-year-old daughter, Victoria, has now started school near their new home in South Shields, Tyne and Wear.

But their hopes of settling down in Britain have been left hanging in the balance after the self-employed business consultant says he was told he did not earn enough for his wife to get a permanent visa.

John Dennis fears his wife Ana Maria, the mother of his daughter Victoria, could be sent back to Panama

Mr Dennis, 50, insists he earns £36,000-a-year from his company, Lean Six Sigma Training, which advises small firms.

But the Home Office say the couple did not provide enough 'evidence' to support their application.

Mr Dennis met his wife while he was working in Panama as a consultant in 2009. Their daughter Victoria was born in Panama in 2010 and they married in 2012.

The family decided England would provide a better life for them and also meant John could be closer to his widowed 80-year-old mother, Audrey.

After moving in April last year, Victoria, who also has a British passport, settled at school, and Ana began the process of applying for a permanent visa.

But they have been left shocked after their application was refused, meaning Ms Ramos de Dennis faces having to return to her home country.

Mr Dennis said: 'Our family is going to be broken up for an indefinite period of time because of faceless bureaucrats.

'Victoria is the one who is going to suffer the most. She will either have to leave the school she loves and leave her dad to go back to Panama or stay here with me and be without her mother.'

Since July 2012, the Immigration Rules have contained a financial requirement to be met by a person applying for entry clearance to remain in the UK.

The minimum income threshold for a couple is £18,600 - which rises to £22,400 where the application includes sponsorship of a non-EU child.

However, the financial requirement does not apply to a child who is a British citizen.

Acceptable 'evidence' includes bank statements  on official bank stationery, electronic bank statements,  building society statements or a letter from a financial institution regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority for money in overseas accounts.

'I can't sleep. I lie awake every night thinking about it and worrying.'

He added: 'The relationship requirements and everything like that were met, but they refused the visa, saying that I don't meet the financial requirements.

'You have to earn £18,600 a year as a minimum. I'm self-employed and earn about £3,000 a month and I gave them bank statements and everything I could think of to prove it.

'But they refused the visa, saying that I don't meet the financial requirements. They said I didnt give the necessary evidence, but didn't say what that was supposed to be.

'She had 28 days to appeal but you have to be in your home country to do that, so she would have had to go back to Panama so we could appeal it.

'If we cant get this decision turned around, we will all have to go back to Panama and start the process of applying again.

'When we went to Panama to hand in the forms and evidence, I was there to answer any questions they wanted to ask, but they didn't ask me anything.

'It's not the refusal that I think is unfair, but it does indicate incompetence and a broken system.'

The Home Office has claimed they have not supplied enough evidence to support their visa application

The family are now pinning their hopes of staying in Britain on an appeal they plan to make against the decision.

A Home Office spokesman said: 'We welcome those who wish to make a life in the UK with their family, work hard and make a contribution.

'Our family rules are designed to make sure that those coming to the UK to join their spouse or partner will not become a burden on the taxpayer and will be well enough supported to integrate effectively.

'Ms Ramos' application was refused because she did not submit the necessary evidence to support her application.'
