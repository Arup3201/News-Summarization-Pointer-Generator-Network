Impatient customers lodged complaints against Mandy Gorey who closed the local branch of the post office for 48 hours after being held up at gun point

A village postmistress who closed the local post office for two days after being held up in an armed raid was investigated by bosses after customers complained they couldn't pick up parcels.

Mandy Gorey, 49, had a gun pointed at her during the raid which took place in Greenfield in Oldham, Greater Manchester.

The mother-of-two who has run the office for 13 years was left so traumatised by the incident she closed its doors for 48 hours.

But impatient local customers lodged formal complaints with the Post Office because they weren't able to collect parcels during the two days.

The claims were investigated but have since been dismissed.

Mrs Gorey was shocked to discover villagers had reported the office's closure as most local residents  sent her flowers and messages of support following the incident November 5. 

After reopening, she placed a notice in the office's window which read: 'Thanks you to all friends and customers for your patience and kind wishes during our terrible ordeal.

'If the two people who made a complaint to customer services about not being able to collect their parcels whilst we were closed would like to make yourselves known we will explain the severity of the ordeal personally.'

The 49-year-old claims the people who lodged complaints would have known why the branch was closed as in such a small village, 'everyone knows what has happened'.

'After the initial anger I just felt sorry for them because they obviously have nothing better to do. But there is no chance they will apologise now out of embarrassment,' she said.

Robbers carrying an axe and a gun attempted to rob the Post Office earlier this month while Ms Gorey was working

'If my customers find out who it is I’m sure they’ll let them know about it.

'If there were stocks in the village they would put them on that.

'But I think the people that have complained have probably suffered enough because everyone has been talking about it. It’s like Chinese whispers in a village like this.'

Mrs Gorey had a gun pointed in her face when the robbers arrived at the post office by motorbike at around four o'clock.

'It was quiet in the office at the time, then two men barged through the door demanding cash.'

'One was holding a hand gun and one an axe.

'One held out the gun at my colleague and I. The other man, with the axe, was blocking the door to prevent entry. In effect we felt like hostages.'

'The ordeal was terrifying - it lasted about three minutes but, in truth, it it felt like ten minutes. It was if it was happening in slow motion.'

A 'guardian angel' customer who tried to enter the branch at the time of the attempted robbery notified police who rushed to the scene in Greenfield, Oldham

Mrs Gorey recalls how the men fled when a customer realised what was happening and phoned police.

The 'guardian angel' tried to enter the post office but was blocked entry. After spotting the motorbike, she looked through the window to see the men yielding an axe and phoned for help.

Speaking of the two people who lodged complains, one local resident said: 'I think maybe they didn’t realise what had happened.

'If they did then it’s really sad. It’s an awful thing to do to Mandy because she’s brilliant.

After learning that two customers lodged complaints against her for closing the branch, the postmistress invited them to get in touch

“She litterpicks around here and does lots for the community. She even paints phone boxes and that’s in her spare time because this post office is used constantly.

'These ridiculous complaints are all we need because after all that’s happened because the robbery was really worrying for the people who live around here.'

Parish councillor Neil Allsopp said: 'The post office is the centre of the community and we are more interested in the real victims, Mandy and her team, not someone who has not been able to collect a parcel.

'Mandy is an integral part of the village and a marvellous asset. We are all pleased she is operating her business again, something for which we should be grateful.

'One of the finest traits of the Saddleworth people is the depth of their compassion and their selfless support for each other through difficult times.

'I know Mandy will have seen this herself over recent weeks. I want her to know and remember, the people of Greenfield support her 100 per cent.'

A Post Office spokesman said: 'Any robbery is traumatic for victims and we will be supporting police in their efforts to apprehend those responsible.

The Post Office would urge anyone with information to contact police.
