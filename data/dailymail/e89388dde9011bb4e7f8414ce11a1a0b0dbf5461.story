A hotel in Queensland has had their Gumtree job advertisement removed because it asked for full length photographs of applicants.

Ravenswood Imperial Hotel in northern Queensland posted an advert on the classifieds website three weeks ago, prompting moderators to remove the ad.

Pub owner John Schluter stands by the employing process, saying that the need for well-presented employees is the same in every industry.

‘We need to know they’re compatible for the pub. If the girls are 4’2 and they can’t see over the bar that obviously isn’t going to work’ he said.

The ad sparked outcry on social media, where some have claimed it encourages discrimination 

‘It’s offbeat to the customers who have just worked 12 hour shifts if the employees are daggy or poorly dressed. We get people here from all over the world.’

While The Fair Work Act does not deny employees the right to ask for a photo, it is considered unlawful to discriminate against employees over their race, colour, sex, age, physical or mental disability or marital status.

But Mr Schluter said this has been the hotels employment policy for some time.

‘We’ve been doing this for eight years, and I’m not sure why it’s an issue. We run a careful establishment here and I can’t have anyone looking unkempt,’ he said.

‘This is the real world,’ he said. ‘It’s not about discrimination; we have had plenty of ethnic employees, some of which speak limited English. It just comes down to staying well-groomed.’

Ravenswood Imperial Hotel in Queensland want attractive and well-dressed bartenders to please customers

The ad sparked outcry on social media, where some have claimed it encourages discrimination.

Miranda Hamilton wrote on Facebook: 'A photo before an interview provides an opportunity for discrimination on appearance not presentation.'

Sinead Hagan wrote: ‘I think its rude to ask for a photo. It just give the employer the opportunity to make judgement without meeting you.’ 

However some Social Media users have supported the business owner, arguing that it is his right as an owner and being attractive is important in hospitality. 

'Its his business, who wants an unpresentable and ugly person serving customers, they should be in call centres where noone can see them. Appearance says a lot about a person,' wrote Lynne Key.

'When your clientele is 99% brought in my miners , you do what ever needs to be done to keep them happy and coming back,' wrote Barry Crowdey.

However, Mr Schluter insists his method of recruitment works and is thrilled that his ad received a good responses.

If you were wondering, sorry, the position is already filled.
