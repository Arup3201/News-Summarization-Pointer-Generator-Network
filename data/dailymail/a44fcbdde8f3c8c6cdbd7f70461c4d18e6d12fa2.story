The biggest ship to sail up the Thames has left the London Gateway port in Essex and is sailing for its next destination Singapore via the Suez Canal at a steady speed of 23 knots.

The huge cargo ship docked at London Gateway before sunrise yesterday morning, guided in by three Port of London Authority tugs.

Edith Maersk was serviced in number two berth by five of the port's cranes - the largest in the country.

Edith Maersk, the second largest container ship in the world, leaves the Thames Estuary near Canvey Island, Essex. The ship, the largest ever to enter the River Thames, had previously docked at London Gateway after arriving from the Far East

Edith Maersk dwarfs London's biggest buildings, at almost 200ft longer than the Shard is tall. It is more than 400ft longer than the Titanic, and more than four times the length of the Cutty Sark

Thanks to London Gateway, gargantuan E-class ships can  be accommodated at three ports in England - Felixstowe and Southampton being the others.

Edith Mærsk is 430yds (397m) long and can carry 13,500 20ft and 40ft containers. It is believed that it was carrying a cargo of clothes and electronic goods when it arrived in England.

The vessel, the second largest container ship in the world, was launched in 2007 and can navigate the Thames following the opening of London Gateway port in the Thames Estuary.

The Gateway cost £1.5bn to build and was opened last year.  It is located on the former 1,500-acre Shell Haven site, which closed in 1999. 

Edith Mærsk is more than 50 per cent longer than Titanic and four times the length of a football pitch.

Spending just a day at Thames Gateway, Edith Maersk is bound for the Suez Canal en route to Singapore, a journey expected to take about a month

Bon voyage: Edith Maersk sets sail tonight from London Gateway. It was the biggest ship to have navigated the waters of the Thames 

The graphic demonstrates the sheer length of the Edith Maersk - it is even longer than the Shard, the highest building in the EU
