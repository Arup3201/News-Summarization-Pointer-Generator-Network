An abnormal load caused traffic chaos today as a dismantled Airbus body made its way across western England.

The aircraft, measuring 155ft long and 19ft wide, left Cotswold Airport in Gloucestershire at around 6am this morning.

The transporter and its 60-tonne load then made its way down the A419 towards the M4 and the Royal Portbury docks near Bristol.

The Airbus Aircraft Fuselage, measuring 155ft long and 19ft wide, travelled along the A419 this morning

It was escorted by a police convoy from Wiltshire Police, who warned members of the public that the scheduled journey would take place.

Drivers planning on catching a flight or making an appointment were advised to allow plenty of time for their travel.

Due to the size of the transporter the Airbus aircraft fuselage was slow-moving and caused congestion for several motorists during its four-hour trip.

Police escort resources were provided by volunteer officers on rest days, paid for by the haulier at no cost to the public

Its final destination, the Royal Portbury docks, has the largest entrance lock into any UK port and is the regular import for thousands of motor vehicles and aviation tanker vehicles.
