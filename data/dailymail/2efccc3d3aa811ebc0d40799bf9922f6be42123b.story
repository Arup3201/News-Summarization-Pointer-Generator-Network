An old Benghazi flame flared back up this week after an email 
surfaced linking the White House to the formation of faulty talking 
points it previously denied any involvement in, exasperating current and
 former Obama administration officials who had hoped the pandemonium 
over Benghazi was in the rear view mirror.

'Dude, this was like two years ago,' Former National Security Council
 spokesman Tommy Vietor told Fox News' Bret Baier on Thursday night 
after proclaiming that he doesn't 'really remember' what changes he did 
or didn't make to the talking points.

'Dude, this was like two years ago,' Former National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor said when asked about Benghazi on Fox News on Thursday night

The White House has long said it did not knowingly send U.S. 
Ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice on national television to say the 
attack was in retaliation for an anti-Muslim film when it knew it was an 
independent act of terrorism. 

Rice's original talking points, created by the CIA, named al-Qaeda as
 perpetrators of the attack. At some point in the editing process, that 
context was taken out, and inaccurate information about the video was inserted in.

The White House and State Department have maintained that they made only
 minor changes to the talking points such as changing  the word 
'consulate' to 'diplomatic facility.'

But a recently declassified email from Deputy National Security 
Adviser Ben Rhodes proves that White House communications staff was told
 that Rice would 'underscore that these protests are rooted in an Internet video, and not a broader failure or policy.'

That email was 'was explicitly not about Benghazi. It 
was about the overall situation in the region, the Muslim world,' White 
House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters on Wednesday.

Carney again claimed that Rice's talking points originated with the 
CIA, not the White House.

That the White House originally classified the
 email has raised eyebrows and caused concern that the White House 
changed the talking points for political gain and subsequently tried to 
bury its tracks.

With a presidential election just around the corner, a 
spontaneous response to a disrespectful YouTube video was favorable to a 
terrorist attack in response to the administration's foreign policy 
strategy, Republicans like South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham argue.

'They understood it was a terrorist attack, that they 
had a political problem, and were going to handle it politically,' 
Sen. Graham said in light of the new information.

'Did you also change ¿attacks¿ to ¿demonstrations¿ in the talking points?' Baier asked Vietor. 'Maybe. I don¿t really remember,' the former Obama flack said

On Thursday  Brett Baier tried to press Vietor on what the National Security Council changed in the talking points as well as when and why. 

'According to the e-mails and the time line, the CIA 
circulates new talking points after they’ve removed the mention of al-Qaeda, and then at 6.21 the White House - you - add a line about the 
administration warning of September 10th of social media reports calling
 for demonstrations,' Baier told Vietor.

'True?'

'Uh, I believe so,' Vietor said.

'Did you also change “attacks” to “demonstrations” in the talking points?' Baier asked.

'Maybe. I don’t really remember,' the former Obama flack said.

'You don’t remember?' Baier asked, prompting Vietor, who is 33, to say, 'Dude, this was like two years ago. We’re still talking about the most mundane process.'

Baier was not amused. 'Dude, it is the thing that everybody is talking about,' he shot back at Vietor. The newscaster again asked Vietor if he changed the talking points, at which point Vietor told him he did not make those changes.

Prior to joining Baier for the evening's show, Vietor, who now runs a
 communications shop with fellow Obama administration alum Jon Favreau, 
flippantly tweeted, 'Guessing @BrettBaier invited me to come on @SpecialReport to talk #Benghazi a #TBT thing since it happened in 2012 but tune in!'

Baier responded five minutes later to Vietor's tweet 
explaining that he was invited on the show because 'I figured since you 
are out of government maybe you can fill in some blanks.'

After the interview, Vietor's twitter was flooded with tweets 
criticizing his attitude toward the terrorist attack that took four 
lives. 

Vietor  then clarified that, 'If you watch the intv with @BrettBaier I'm clearly saying I don't remember who edited a document two years ago. Not dismissing the attacks.'
