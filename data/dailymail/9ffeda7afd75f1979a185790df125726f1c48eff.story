Britain was today accused of being the most 'in your face' sexist country in the world by a UN expert from South Africa.  

Rashida Manjoo, who is compiling a report on violence against women in the UK, said that the country has a 'boys' club sexist culture'.  

Her evidence for that 'culture included women being wolf-whistled in the street and the popularity of social media, while she blamed the Government's cuts for increasing society's entrenched sexism.

Critics ridiculed Ms Manjoo's comments, pointing out that gender inequality in Britain pales in comparison to countries such as Saudi Arabia where women face systematic repression.  

Sexism: Rashida Manjoo, the UN's special rapporteur on violence against women, today said the culture of gender inequality in Britain was 'more prevalent' than anywhere else

The UN special rapporteur on violence against women originally comes from South Africa, known as the 'rape capital of the world', where has been estimated that  40 per cent of women will be raped at some point in their lifetime.

The other countries she has visited as part of her duties include Somalia, where women are routinely subjected to female genital mutilation, and Papua New Guinea, where polygamy is common.  

Ms Manjoo has been in Britain for two weeks investigating the prevalence of violence against women, and today announced her preliminary findings.

She said: 'Have I seen this level of sexist culture in other countries? It hasn't been so in-your-face in other countries. I haven't seen that so pervasively in other countries. I'm sure it exists but it wasn't so much and so pervasive.  

'I'm not sure what gives rise to a more visible presence of sexist portrayals of women and girls in this country in particular. What is clear from these indications of portrayals of women and girls is that there is a boys' club sexist culture. That exists and it does lead to perceptions about women and girls in this country.'  

The special rapporteur added: 'If I was walking down the street and there were whistles - which won't happen at this stage in my life - but that's sexist culture.'  

Ms Manjoo, a lawyer and academic, pointed to 'the easy availability of porn, the use of social media including influencing young children around images', as well as 'harassment on the Tube'.  

In the 2013 Global Gender Gap Report issued by the World Economic Forum, the UK was ranked the 18th most equal out of 136 countries surveyed.  

Former minister Edwina Currie dismissed the idea that Britain was uniquely plagued by sexism.

She told the Telegraph: 'Why can't she go to a country where women can't drive cars, or have maternity leave? There are plenty of countries where women face serious problems.

'You can't say they have a big problem in the UK. Most of the women I know like living here and enjoy being in a diverse and interesting society.'

Ms Manjoo - who visited London, Leicester, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Belfast, Cookstown, Cardiff and Bristol - also suggested that cuts in public spending were increasing gender inequality.  

'Access to trauma services, financial support and housing are crucial, yet current reforms to the funding and benefits system continue to adversely impact women's ability to address safety and other relevant issues,' she said.

The special rapporteur claimed that she had been denied access to the controversial Yarl's Wood women's detention centre despite repeated requests to the Government.

She said: 'Due to receiving information from the third sector, I was keen to speak to detainees in this facility to objectively seek information on violations being experienced.'

Some of the countries Rashida Manjoo has visited as part of her UN duties include:

BANGLADESH: Miss Manjoo noted ‘the strong persistence of patriarchal attitudes towards women’.

She said she had been prevented from visiting a refugee camp where she had received reports of ‘sexual and gender-based violence’.

PAPUA NEW GUINEA: She said violence against women was pervasive, blaming a belief in sorcery.

In 2012 she said she was shocked by the brutality of assaults against suspected sorcerers, including, rape, mutilations and murder. Polygamy also led to violence.

KYRGYZSTAN: Miss Manjoo had concerns about bride kidnappings, sexual harassment and violence against lesbians. In 2009, she reported: ‘Unregistered religious marriages, early marriage and polygamy are increasingly undermining women’s rights.’

EL SALVADOR: Following her 2010 visit, Miss Manjoo said that ‘of particular concern is the alarming rise in the number of murders of women and girls and the brutality inflicted on their bodies, which is often accompanied by kidnapping and sexual assault’.

JORDAN: Miss Manjoo expressed concern in 2011 over ‘laws that are discriminatory to women’. She said ‘women still do not enjoy equal rights and responsibilities with regard to marriage, divorce, custody issues and personal status’.

SOMALIA: She was concerned by problems of female genital mutilation during her visit in 2011 and said ‘impunity for violence against women is the norm’.

Danger? The UN expert warned that British women face harrassment on the Tube (file photo) 

A spokesman for the Home Office said: 'Violence against women and girls in any form is unacceptable and the Government has shown its commitment to ending it.

'A comprehensive programme was drawn up for the Special Rapporteur's visit, including meetings with the Home Secretary, the Minister for Crime Prevention, and the Chief Inspector of Prisons.

'Several other options, including a trip to a women's refuge, were turned down by the Special Rapporteur.'

Ms Manjoo is only the latest in a string of UN special rapporteurs to lecture Britain over alleged social problems.  

Last year, Raquel Rolnik was denounced by MPs as a 'loopy Brazilian leftie' after she called for the abolition of the so-called bedroom tax.  

And in 2011, Yves Cabanne accused an Essex council of breaking human rights law by evicting a group of travellers from the illegal Dale Farm site.
