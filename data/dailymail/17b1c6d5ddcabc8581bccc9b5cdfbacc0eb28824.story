Britain's biggest DIY chain has been heavily criticised by conservationists for increasing the amount of peat in its new topsoil.

B&Q's Verve topsoil contains two-fifths of peat matter - which is an unsustainable natural resource.

Environmentalists have expressed their concern with the new product and accused the store of setting a bad example.

Peat bogs play a major role in protecting threatened wetland habitats around the world.

They take millions of years to develop and are home to rare species of plants and animals.

B&Q is the largest retailer in the UK of topsoil and sells about Â£5million worth of it every year.

Rob Shore, head of wetland conservation at the Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust, said: 'This is a disappointing move by B&Q.

'It is not the actions you would expect from a market leader. They do drive the industry forward and should be taking a lead on issues like this.

'They are not being as aspirational as they could be.'

When peat bogs are drained for human use, the vast amounts of carbon which is stored by them is released into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, the harmful greenhouse gas.

Although some peat bogs are protected, others continue to be drained which releases up to a million tons of carbon dioxide every year.

Plans are underway by the government to phase out the use of peat in gardens by 2020.

Speaking to The Independent, the DIY chain said: 'Our topsoil does contain a percentage of peat and we are completely transparent about that on the packaging.'

Its new topsoil is lighter than alternatives which are peat-free and is easier to transport.
