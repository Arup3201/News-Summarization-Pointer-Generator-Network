It is common to wear gold jewellery to add a little extra glamour to your look, but have you ever considered some bling for your eyes?

One doctor has done just that by creating contact lenses infused with nano gold particles.

Mumbai's Dr Chandrashekhar Chawan fused the gold with regular contact lenses to create a 'glitter' effect for wearers.

But if you want to enjoy the ultimate sparkling eyes, you'll have to shell out between $15,000 (£9,745) and $18,000 (£11,690).

The 24-carat particles were added to the normal eyewear at Shekhar Eye Research India in a specialised paste form. 

In order to avoid contact between the eyes and the gold, an extra layer is applied. 

Several customers showed off their glittering and spell-binding eyes in Dr Chawan's office.

Each contact weighs 5g and it is not known whether the tiny gold flecks affect vision.

And it that wasn't luxurious enough, the same doctor has also created contact lenses infused with diamonds.

Describing his diamond contact lenses to USA Today, Dr Chawan said: ' I got mixed responses - some said it looks scary, but most of the people loved it.'

Some experts in the US have expressed safety fears over the lenses, which Dr Chawan hopes to sell outside of India.

Some say the bulky lenses used in orders to protect the eye from the gold are not ideal and they are yet to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.
