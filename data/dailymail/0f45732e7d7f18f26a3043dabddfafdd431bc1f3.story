Sarah Harding has admitted she hasn't always got it right in the fashion stakes.

'I think it's safe to say the early days of Girls Aloud hold a few shockers!' said the stylish singer when grilled about her worst fashion disasters.

The blonde beauty, 32, has since realised what suits her best and matured into a fashion forward star who always gets it right on the red carpet, says her stylist Ozzy Shah.

'I think back in the day popstars in 
general were still trying to break out of the 90s trend with big bold 
colours and the whole band dressing alike,' says Ozzy.

'During
 the early Girls Aloud days their fashion was a bit hit and miss, but 
now Sarah has grown to understand what suits her best, now that she’s an
 independent woman.

'She 
knows how to look glamorous and sexy and I think having been in the 
industry for 10 years, her experience has taught her what looks best.

'I think Sarah’s style has really 
evolved with age and confidence. Sarah knows what she wants and she 
completely trusts my judgement as her stylist and listens to my advice 
also.

'Sarah is a strong woman and has that bit of rock 'n' roll edge to her. She loves a good J Brand leather trouser and happily mixes in High Street. But when I style her for red carpet events I love seeing Sarah in a more feminine and soft approach.'

Sarah describes her look as simple but elegant and has said she likes designer labels but prefers to shop on the High Street.

While she's a fan of Alexander McQueen and Gianmarco Lorenzi, Sarah says the British High Street can't be beaten.

'I love Topshop and Zara,' she tells the Express.

The notorious party girl reveals to MailOnline that she's on a health kick.

Sarah has been 
spending a lot of time in LA and seems to have picked up the 
healthy California lifestyle.

'I’ve caught the juicing bug. I love being in the kitchen and cooking and creating juices and smoothies,' she says.

'I
 love anything green and I make my own juices packed with kale, parsley,
 cucumber, courgettes, apples, plus spirulina and chlorella.’

She explained that she keeps in shape by hitting the cross-trainer every day and avoiding carbs, especially before bedtime.

The Berkshire-born beauty, who was once a mainstay at clubs such as Mahiki, is hooked on supplements.

'I love supplements, I take multi-vitamins and omega-3,' she told MailOnline.

Fabe B4 ambassador Sarah says travelling doesn't agree 
with her skin - so she uses their products

Her former partying ways have, however, taken their toll on her skin and she is on a mission to undo the years of late nights.

'Travelling a lot doesn’t agree with my skin so I am obsessed with cleansing morning and night at the moment.

'I
 am hooked on a product called Faceb4, which I use before photo shoots 
because it removes the bacteria before applying cosmetics and keeps my 
skin healthy.'

Sarah fronts a new campaign by FaceB4 called HealthB4Beauty, which hopes to encourage people to get back to the basics of skincare.
