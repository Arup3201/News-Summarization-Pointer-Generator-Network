'I just wanted to teach those guys a lesson for daring to come into my house uninvited like that,' said Mr Nabi, right, with his wife Shamim and their seven-year-old daughter Sumaiya

A brave father saw off four masked raiders armed with knives who burst into his home and threatened his wife and daughter.

Zahir Nabi raced down the stairs, punched the thug holding a blade to his wife’s neck and then launched a ferocious attack on the remaining three raiders.

They fled the family home empty-handed with Mr Nabi in pursuit. He followed then down the road until he was sure his family was safe.

Last night he was praised by police who said he showed both incredible bravery and strength in fighting off the gang.

Mr Nabi, 41 was getting changed in the bathroom after coming home from work when the raiders struck. His wife Shamim, 33, opened the front door and was confronted by four masked men who forced their way into the house in Salford.

One knifeman grabbed her around the face and pointed his blade at her neck. Mr Nabi – who is known as Zac –  said: ‘I heard the front door open fast and loud like it hit against the radiator. Next thing I know my wife is screaming. I thought at first it might have been a dog running in the house or something.

‘Her screaming was getting louder so I popped my head round the door and saw a masked man grappling her with a knife at her chest pointing to her neck.

‘I literally launched myself from upstairs on to the bannister and all the way down to the bottom and hit straight into the man. I got him out the way by punching him, elbowing him and kicking him.

‘There was another one in the doorway and so I punched him too. Then I realised there were two more in the lounge where my daughter was. She was screaming in fear because she would have seen all the commotion. I came into the lounge and they came at me with a knife.

He added: ‘They were right next to my 
daughter Sumaiya – I didn’t know what they were going to do with the 
knife. For all I know they were going to use it on her.

Zahir Nabi dashed out of his bathroom to find one of the thugs pushing a knife to wife Shamim's neck and demanding cash as their seven-year-old daughter looked on in terror

‘I kicked and punched them both before
kicking them all out of the house one by one. I must have been fuelled 
by adrenaline because I am not normally like that.’

The father-of-one said: ‘If I wasn’t 
in the house at the time, God only knows what could have happened. When I
saw them I didn’t care about anything other than saving my wife and 
girl – they are worth more to me than anything.’ Mr Nabi said: ‘People 
should have the right to defend their property if anyone breaks in and 
its only right that a homeowner should do what they can to safeguard 
their family.’

David Cameron has already pledged the Government will legislate to protect homeowners who fight back against intruders.

The Prime Minister said burglary was a
‘violent crime’ and pledged that victims will be able to use necessary 
force to protect themselves without being prosecuted.

Greater Manchester Police said all of 
the raiders were about 5ft 9in tall, of skinny build and were wearing 
dark clothing and balaclavas. PC Mark Rigby said: ‘This man showed both 
incredible bravery and strength to fight off four men who had invaded 
the sanctity of his home.

Mr Nabi chased the four men out of his house and kicked one of them to the floor before they all escaped

‘However, in applauding this man for 
his heroic actions, it is also fortunate he himself was not injured 
because the raiders had armed themselves with knives.

‘Greater Manchester Police would 
always advise people confronted by such violence not to put themselves 
in harm’s way as possessions can be replaced, people cannot.

‘However, this man deserves special praise for the courage he showed in protecting his wife and daughter.’

Three masked men who tried to steal a 
cash box from a slimming class fled in disarray when the class’s female 
leader knocked one of them over with her chair.

The raiders burst into a Slimming 
World meeting in a church hall in  Harpurhey, Manchester. One of them 
ran across the room to grab the evening’s takings.

But the class leader picked up her 
chair and used it to knock him to the floor. Police said the thief 
dropped the box and all three offenders ran out of the building.
