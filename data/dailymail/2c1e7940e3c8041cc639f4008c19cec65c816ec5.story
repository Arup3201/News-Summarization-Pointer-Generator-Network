It is a sign of how far Glasgow Warriors have come that leaving Toulouse with an eight-point defeat is disappointing. But I can’t help feeling this was a missed opportunity for them to get, at least, a losing bonus point.

There were a few things outwith their own control but, ultimately, it came down to their own ill discipline which cost them a chance of winning.

It is tough enough playing at Toulouse with a full complement of players on the pitch but to play them for a full 20 minutes when down to 14 men is near impossible.

There are good penalties and there are bad penalties in rugby. The good ones are when you are under severe pressure on your own line and giving away three points is much better than the seven that would occur if you let them recycle possession.

Both the penalties that resulted in yellow cards were nothing like this.

The first was a stupid tip tackle from Finn Russell when he took his opposite number above the horizontal and drove him into the ground. The fact that it was his back that he landed on and not his neck meant it was a yellow rather than a red card but Glasgow conceded 13 points during the period of being down a man.

The other sin-binning was even dumber as Leone Nakarawa knocked the ball out of the scrum-half’s hand when he was lying on the ground and the Warriors defence was looking very strong.

They only conceded three points during this period but it took a lot of energy for that to happen, which meant they had too much to do at the end of the match.

Discipline is key and even more important when you go down to 14 men but Glasgow coughed up easy ball on two occasions to give Toulouse possession, one which resulted in the only try of the game for the French just at the start of the second half.

Glasgow showed real guts to emerge with a try of their own at the end from sub Niko Matawalu.

I am sure I was not alone in screaming at the TV for him to sprint as fast as he could to make the kick as easy as possible. But he jogged over the line, which meant that Duncan Weir had a tougher kick to earn the Warriors a losing bonus point — and he subsequently missed.

It was a moment that could come back to haunt the Scots as all points in this group are going to be vital.

There was a contentious decision at the end of the first half that ultimately cost Glasgow, as well. Referee John Lacey allowed Toulouse to take a quick line-out when Josh Strauss was lying close by on the ground with a head injury.

This play ended up with the French converting a penalty, which was the main cause at the end of Glasgow missing out on a losing bonus point.

There were many good performances from the likes of Alex Dunbar, Jonny Gray and Rob Harley but Glasgow were not able to convert pressure into points in the first 20 minutes when they dominated possession and territory.

All is not lost because the return match comes only in six days’ time and Glasgow have another chance to turn the tables on Toulouse.

What is key is to win the game without Toulouse gaining the bonus point that eluded Glasgow yesterday.

Qualification to the quarter-finals is still in their own hands but only if they win at Scotstoun next Saturday.

There is nothing to fear from Toulouse. They showed glimpses of potential yesterday but Glasgow can cope with them.

Keeping all of their players on the pitch for the full 80 minutes is a must, though.
