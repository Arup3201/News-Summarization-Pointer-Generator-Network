Patients who smoke or are very obese are being denied routine operations by cost-cutting NHS managers.

Bosses in Northern, Eastern and Western Devon Clinical Commissioning Group said the measures are ‘urgent and necessary’ to help recover a £14.5 million debt.

Under a policy to be introduced this month, morbidly obese patients will have to lose a certain amount of weight before they will be put forward for any non-urgent operations.

The restrictions will apply to patients requiring non-urgent operations and are ‘urgent and necessary’ to help recover a £14.5 million debt, say hospital bosses in Devon 

These patients have a body mass index of 40 or higher which is equivalent to a 6ft man weighing just over 20 stone.

The CCG – which covers a population of 900,000 – has yet to decide how much weight they must lose but it could be several stone to bring them down into the ‘obese’ or ‘overweight’ range.

Similarly, it is demanding that smokers give up for at least six weeks before being put on the waiting list for all non-urgent surgery.

But experts accused managers of ‘prescriptively’ rationing vital treatment from patients just because of their lifestyle choices.

Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, pointed out that operations such as hip and knee replacements would be hugely beneficial for the obese in helping them exercise.

‘This is a prescriptive and cost-cutting measure.’

‘Such operations would be hugely cost effective in the long term and highly beneficial for patients.

‘It’s just rationing.’

The organisation said it had no choice and needed to ensure there was enough money to care for patients during the busy winter months.

But it is not the first time managers have resorted to such arbitrary measures to cut costs.

Smokers will have to give up for at least six weeks before being put on the waiting list

In 2012 it emerged that a quarter of trusts were restricting at least one procedures from the obese or smokers – although in most cases it was IVF.

At the time, managers pointed out that surgery can be riskier and less effective for patients who are very overweight or who smoke.

They are more likely to develop potentially fatal complications as a result of the general anaesthetic including pneumonia, blood clots, heart attacks or kidney failure.

Hip and knee replacements tend to be less successful in the obese and there is also evidence they benefit less from IVF.

As part of its cost-cutting measures, the CCG is also making it harder for all patients to have cataract surgery or hernias removed.

They will have to meet certain criteria before being eligible which might include a certain amount of sight loss or having restricted movement.

Patients who have a body mass index of 40 or higher - which is equivalent to a 6ft man weighing just over 20 stone - will be targeted 

Rebecca Harriott, the CCG’s chief officer, said: ‘We must act to protect essential services through our busiest winter months and ensure that care is there for our patients when they really need it,” she said.

‘The CCG has already begun to implement a series of measures designed to improve efficiency in the system and encourage patients to contribute to improving their own health outcomes.

‘These measures bring the CCG into line with similar organisations in the NHS. However, they are not enough.

‘The CCG is working up a series of measures to prioritise those patients most in need, while at the same time, increasing efficiency in the wider system – and the CCG itself.’
