An obsessed Game of Thrones fan has put on 10lbs of pure muscle to transform himself into a hulking star of the show.

Rene Koiter, 29, spent ten months training to perfectly resemble the imposing character Khal Drogo, leader of the Dothraki.

Mr Koiter even employed a team of eight staff to
 help him with his professional transformation, so that he could look 
just like Khal - married to character Daenerys Targaryen.

Obsessed Game of Thrones fan Rene Koiter has put on 10lbs of pure muscle to transform himself into a hulking star of the show

He decided to transform himself into his favourite character, leader of the Dothraki, Khal Drogo, and spent ten months training to perfectly resemble the imposing character

In order to beef up for his transformation, Mr Koiter attended a boot camp class three times a week, and worked out at a gym during his lunch breaks and took long walks on his days off

When he first debuted his muscly new look at a staff party, the subsequent video went viral amassing over a quarter million hits on YouTube. 

Since his makeover to the character - played by Jason Momoa -  the graphic designer has gained a legion of female fans and has been bombarded with marriage proposals from women online.

Mr Koiter, from Lake Forest, California said: 'Honestly, I had no idea what the reaction would be towards my transformation.

'Many marriage proposals have been flung at me.

'My joking response to these women is usually "Can you eat a horse heart like Daenerys famously does in the TV series?"

Khal Drogo is played by Jason Momoa. He even employed a team of eight staff to help him with his professional transformation, so that he could look just like Khal - married to character Daenerys Targaryen

Mr Koiter said: 'Many marriage proposals have been flung at me. My joking response to these women is usually "Can you eat a horse heart like Daenerys famously does in the TV series?"'

Mr Koiter, 29, also completely changed his diet to achieve the look - cutting out all sugars and simple carbohydrates

'Imagine my surprise when they come back to me, saying they would eat two hearts for me.

M'athchomaroon!  Hello!

Hash yer dothrae chek? How are you?

Asshekhqoyi vezhvena! Happy birthday!

Es havazhaan! Get lost!

And upon meeting an enemy: Anha vazhak yeraan thirat - I will let you live

'It's flattering of course but I worry that people are mixing up the fantasy from the reality.

'Nevertheless, I do enjoy that the public are entertained because of this.'

Mr Koiter - who is already fluent in five languages - also learnt Dothraki, Khal Drogo's fictional dialect in the series for a complete makeover.

In order to beef up for his transformation, Mr Koiter attended a boot camp class three times a week, and worked out at a gym during his lunch breaks and took long walks on his days off.

He also took afternoon bike rides in the Californian sunshine to perfect his Khal Drogo tan.

His rigorous training regime means he is now able to flip an 850lbs tyre, equivalent in weight to the average horse.

Mr Koiter also completely changed his diet.

He said: 'I used to be a big cereal junkie - I would eat that for breakfast, lunch and dessert. But no more.

'I had to quit all sugars and simple carbs to achieve this look. Now I eat things like veggies, fruits, eggs, oatmeal, chicken, lean beef, fish and protein shakes.'

He said: 'I spent months growing out my hair for extensions, pumping iron like a mad man and then mimicking his Dothraki speech and mannerisms'

He said: 'Drogo was indeed a juggernaut of a character to bring to life. The whole process took almost ten months and what I'll say is that you really need a team of people to build him properly.

'I spent months growing out my hair for extensions, pumping iron like a mad man and then mimicking his Dothraki speech and mannerisms.'

For his next project, Rene is considering transforming into another Game of Thrones' character, Jon Snow played by Kit Harington in the series.

The new series of Game of Thrones airs on 6 April 2014 and a 15-minute trailer for series 4 came out last night.
