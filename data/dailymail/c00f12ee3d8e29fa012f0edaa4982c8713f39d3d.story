Shon Handrahan, 31, was sentenced to 60 days in jail after he pleaded guilty to sending nude photographs of his estranged wife 

A Utah man who pleaded guilty to sending nude photographs of his estranged wife to her acquaintances has been sentenced to 60 days in jail. 

Shon Handrahan, 31, said he wasn't in his right mind when he sent the graphic images, which were accompanied with the words 'what do you think of your little angel now?', in 2012. 

Handrahan texted the images after his estranged wife ignored at least 100 text messages from him, some of which were threatening, according to authorities.

'I'm really sorry for what I've done,' Handrahan said in court on Tuesday. 'If I had been in the right mind, I wouldn't have done it.' 

Handrahan has already served 90 days in jail for the offense. 

Handrahan's case spurred Utah lawmakers to pass a new revenge porn bill that forbids the sharing of intimate images without the consent of the person pictured.

A first offense is considered a misdemeanor, and repeat offenses are felonies. Handrahan was charged under old statutes - before the new law took effect.

Handrahan texted numerous images with the tag line 'what do you think of your little angel now?' after his estranged wife ignored at least 100 text messages from him, according to authorities

Prosecutor Nathan Lyon wanted more jail time, saying he didn't see Handrahan 'accepting' much responsibility. 

'This wasn't something he did all of a sudden,' Lyon said. 'This was something that had been building up all day long.' 

Defense attorney Edward Brass argued Handrahan accepted responsibility when he agreed to a plea deal with prosecutors last month. 

Handrahan pleaded guilty to distributing pornographic material and electronic communication harassment. 

The couple have since divorced. Handrahan's now ex-wife supported the deal and wanted to revolve the case quickly due to public attention her case was receiving, according to Lyon.  

Salt Lake City Democratic Representative Marie Poulson  pushed for the revenge porn law, saying the practice most often targets women and can cause some to lose their jobs.

‘These things are used to harm the other individual, to ruin their life or destroy them personally with their jobs or their families,' she told the Salt Lake Tribune. 

Thirteen states, including Utah, have passed laws to punish revenge porn in the past two years, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
