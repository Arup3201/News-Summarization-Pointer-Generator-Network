His legacy lives on: The remainder of Paul Walker's Fast & Furious 7 scenes will be filmed by brothers Cody and Caleb, it has been confirmed

Paul Walker's younger, lookalike brother has been asked to step in for him to film the final scenes for Fast & The Furious 7, it emerged today.

The 40-year-old star was on a break from filming at the time of his death in a shocking car crash two weeks ago.

And in a poignant tribute to the star, MailOnline can reveal Cody Walker, 25, who has worked as a movie stuntman, is set to take his place in the latest installment of the hit franchise.

Following Paul's death, Universal Pictures announced it was their 'duty' to shut down production - adding they were 'dedicated to providing support to Paul's immediate family and our extended Fast & Furious family of cast, crew, and filmmakers.'

A source close to production said today: 'Producers had a string of meetings right after Paul's death.

'They soon realized they needed someone who looked like Paul to finish the movie and that's when they approached his nearly identical brother, Cody.'

Cody, who lives in Oregon, has been staying with his mother Cheryl in Los Angeles and helping to comfort her since his brother's death, and the source added: 'They can shoot Cody from behind and at distance and if it's a shot they need Paul's face in close up they can CGI it later on.

'If Cody agrees it's because he wants to honor his brother's memory. There are many details that still need to be worked out, but right now the family and cast and crew are all still grieving.'

In addition to this, Universal have also made it clear they will work with the Walker family and take their guidance on a fitting exit for Paul's Fast & Furious character, Brian O'Connor, according to the source.

Today, a spokesman for Universal told MailOnline: 'Right now, all of us at Universal are dedicated to providing support to Paul's immediate family and our extended Fast & Furious family of cast, crew and filmmakers.  

'At this time we feel it is our responsibility to shut down production on Fast & Furious 7 for a period of time so we can assess all options available to move forward with the franchise.  We are committed to keeping Fast & Furious fans informed, and we will provide further information to them when we have it.  Until then, we know they join us in mourning the passing of our dear friend Paul Walker.'

This week, The Hollywood Reporter 
reported that screenwriter Chris Morgan is hard at work on script 
revisions to director James Wan’s Fast & The Furious 7 with hopes of
 'retiring' the character using footage that was shot before Paul passed
 away in a car accident in Los Angeles on November 30.

The magazine reported that the cast could be back to work as early as January on the sequel, but added: 'that’s a big if.'

Sources told THR that Universal has 'already has poured about $150 
million into the film, a bill that its insurance firm, Fireman's Fund, 
might have to pay in full if Universal concludes the picture must be 
started anew.'

Meanwhile, the Walker family gathered yesterday as the actor's remains were created ahead of a small funeral service tomorrow.

According to RadarOnline, Paul's body was transferred from the mortuary at 
Los Angeles cemetery Forest Lawn Memorial Park to a crematory in 
Glendale, California

The
 funeral will be held on the weekend and will be a family affair, although
 it has been reported some of Paul's Fast & Furious co-stars such as Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez and Tyrese Gibson will attend.

This week it was reported that the Walker family had watched a screening of Paul's last movie, The Hours at a theater in  La Canada Flintridge, California, according to US Weekly.

'His family was very stoic. But they enjoyed the film and had a really lovely evening,' said a spokesman.

Paul's 15-year-old daughter Meadow, however, did not attend the screening as she and her grandfather, Paul Walker III, had already viewed the film at this year's Southwest Film Festival.

Earlier 
this week, the family claimed plastic road markers may have been 
responsible for the crash that killed the star after stunt experts 
claimed the 2005 Porsche Carrera GT driven by Paul's friend hit the 
markers, called Bott's Dots, and careered out of control.

Total devastation: There was little left of the wreckage after impact, with investigators ruling that speed and not a mechanical fault was to blame for the tragedy

An integral part of the action: Paul, seen here in a 2001 shot with his The Fast & The Furious castmates, starred in five of the six films in the franchise, while he was halfway through shooting the seventh instalment when he tragically died in a car crash right out of the films' script

According to TMZ,
 sources close to his family said that having visited the site, the 
experts claimed the bumps may have caused the car to hydroplane, 
resulting in the driver losing control.

Paul and driver Roger Rodas died on November 30 when their car hit a pole and tree and caught fire in the Los Angeles suburb.

The
 experts told the family that the car could have lost traction after 
hitting the bumps, which are used to separate lanes of traffic, and 
skidded off the road.

The claims come after question marks were raised over the safety of the car itself following the crash.

The Porsche was being driven by the Hollywood star's friend and business partner Rodas.

It has since emerged that car experts have long expressed concern about the souped-up model's suitability for the road, due to its ultra light carbon-fiber frame and 5.7 liter race-derived V10 engine.

It has a flat out speed of 205 miles per hour and its design is derived from earlier Porsche Le Mans models.

Porsche knew of the car's sensitivity 
when they launched the model in 2004.

According to TMZ, a memo 
circulated to sales staff said of the GT Carrera: 'This vehicle cannot 
drive over a Foster Beer can that is lying on its side.'

'You need to be aware of what type of road surface you are on (dips; pot holes, seam heights, etc.)

'The Carrera GT is as close to a racecar as we will ever get, this car has all the disadvantages of a racecar.

Police have revealed that a second man
 has been charged with stealing a piece of the wreckage of the Porsche 
that Walker was a passenger in when he was killed.

Anthony Janow, 25, was released on $60,000 bail following the charges.

Prosecutors say that Janow and 18-year-old Jameson Witty stole a roof panel from the wreck as it was being towed away from the site.

The pair could face up to four-and-a-half years in prison for the offense.

Witty, who is also free on bail, was caught on video stealing the T-top roof of the Porsche right off the tow truck and afterwards he even bragged about the heist by posting pics of the stolen wreckage on Instagram.

The wrecked Porsche Carrera GT was being hauled by a flat-bed tow truck hours after the wreck that claimed the movie star and friend Roger Rodas, who was driving the vehicle when it crashed.

The tow truck stopped at a red light and a male jumped out of a car following it to grab a piece of the car – he then hopped back into his car and sped away, according to police.

The tow truck driver immediately reported the theft.

A search warrant was executed on Thursday, and police found the stolen car panel - a part from the sports car's roof.

Witty has since taken to Instagram to apologize for his actions. 'I wanted to say my intentions for the piece I took off the two truck were to make a memorial out of it. Paul was a childhood idol to me and many.

The investigation into the crash that killed both Walker and Rodas is still ongoing.
