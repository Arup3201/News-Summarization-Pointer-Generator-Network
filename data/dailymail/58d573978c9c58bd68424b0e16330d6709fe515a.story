French-trained Karakontie prevented a first blank for Europe at the Breeders’ Cup since 2007 when landing the $2million Mile at Santa Anita in California.

But there was agony for Jamie Osborne’s Toast Of New York, who was just touched by Bayern when second in the $5million Classic.

The consolation for Jamie Spencer’s mount, who himself was just in front of Kentucky Derby winner California Chrome in third, was prize money of over £500,000.

For a few tense minutes after the race, it still seemed as if Toast Of New York might still get the win as Bob Baffert-trained Bayern and his jockey Martin Garcia had to survive a stewards’ enquiry after jinking left at the stalls and hampering fourth-placed Shared Belief.

But the result ultimately stood.

Meanwhile, the Jonathan Pease-trained Karakontie, ridden by Stephane Pasquier, held off Freddie Head-trained Anodin with David Simcock’s Trade Storm third to win his race.

Dermot Weld’s Mustajeeb was sixth but there was disappointment for Richard Hannon-trained favourite Toronado.

On his final run, the Queen Anne Stakes winner drifted and faded into eighth of the 14 starters after racing prominently under a tactically aggressive ride from champion jockey Richard Hughes.

Karakontie, a 16-1 shot on account of his tough wide draw, had been beaten in two runs since his French Guineas success, having had a poor draw in the French Derby and a hampered run in the Prix de la Foret.

Pease said: ‘It’s a great result. He was a brilliant two-year-old and was very good this spring. We gave him a break and he showed a great turn of foot today.’

Pasquier added: ‘This is the biggest win of my career, to win a Breeders’ Cup race here in America. The trainer didn’t give me any instructions. I just rode him like the quality horse he is.

‘I had a bad draw on the outside but got a good position. It is easier when you are on the best horse in the race and he gave me everything and quickened very well.’
