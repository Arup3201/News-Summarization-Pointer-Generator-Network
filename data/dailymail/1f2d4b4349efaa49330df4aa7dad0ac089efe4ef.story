A drunk female passenger repeatedly bit a flight attendant on the hand and then kicked another in the testicles on a flight to Bali, a court has heard.

Tara Anne MacKay, 28, became intoxicated after boarding the Air New Zealand service with her partner on August 17 last year.

She began yelling and swearing loudly and spilled her drink. One passenger felt so threatened by her behaviour she fled from her seat and reported her to cabin crew, according to the Otago Daily Times.

Attendants asked her to calm down and accompany them to back of the plane. But MacKay refused and hurled her drink at a female staff member and then tried to push past the crew to return to her seat.

A struggle ensued which ended when the drunken passenger locked herself in the toilet and refused to come out.

The captain authorised the crew to unlock the door, and they tried to physically wrestle MacKay from the bathroom.

Cabin attendants managed to restrain MacKay and secure her in handcuffs and a leg restraint.

However, the enraged passenger managed to bite Susan Lawson-Hurst hard on the hand three times, then kicked an unidentified male member of staff in the testicles.

As a result of the attack, Ms Lawson-Hurst suffered a swollen and bruised hand with a suspected hairline fracture.

MacKay admitted assault with intent to injure when she appeared at Dunedin District Court yesterday.

She had little recollection of some of the events that ensued on the flight but said she would have behaved reasonably if the cabin crew had left her alone.

However she admitted she should not have drunk as much as she did.

Judge Dominic Flatley told MacKay her actions would have been 'extremely frightening' to other passengers. He added that her behaviour would also have had an impact on flight crew.

She was sentenced to 300 hours community service, 12 months supervision and told she had to complete drug and alcohol counselling.
