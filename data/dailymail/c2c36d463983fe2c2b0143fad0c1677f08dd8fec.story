It is furniture befitting the most prestigious seat of learning. But a university’s plans to pay £150,000 for a set of seven hand-crafted chairs have left staff in a fury.

Plymouth University has commissioned luxury furniture maker John Makepeace to create the three-legged seats for use in graduation ceremonies.

They are meant to be seen as symbols of success, although as yet it is unclear exactly who would be sitting on them.

A senior university source said the total price tag stands at £150,000 – a quarter of the total £600,000 budget for this year’s graduation programme.

Nick Varney of the UCU teaching union said the decision was a mistake at a time when staff were being laid off. 

‘Splashing out £150,000 on seven chairs really is quite extraordinary,’ he said.

‘It is even more incredible when you consider that financial problems have been given as a reason for job cuts.

‘If the university needs to save money it should look at its travel and expenses bills and cut down on chairs.

‘Anyone who thinks chairs are a symbol of success is more out of touch than we feared and should probably not be running a university. A successful university is one where students receive a quality education from well-supported staff – chairs simply don’t come into it.’

Students condemned the decision, one tweeting: ‘Plymouth University spend £150,000 on seven chairs ... Not professorial “chairs”. Real chairs. To sit on. Mad.’

Deputy vice-chancellor David Coslett said the commissioning process was ongoing and the university planned to pay for the chairs through private donations and charitable foundations.

Professor Coslett was warned in a series of emails between senior staff members that it would be damaging to the university’s reputation if the price was made public. But he said in the emails that he was keen to push ahead, saying the chairs would be ‘a symbol of success’.

He added: ‘If there is any disquiet, I am more than confident time will judge this to have been a great decision.’

He said the chairs followed the commissioning of ceremonial robes and a mace and the granting of a coat of arms.
