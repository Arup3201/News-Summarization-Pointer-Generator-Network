The parents of three children were arrested in Daytona Beach, Florida yesterday after police discovered the family living in a dead woman's house - all while the woman's body was decomposing in a bedroom.

Police conducted a well-being check at the home in Holly Hill after being contacted by the Department of Children and Families who hadn't been able to contact the home's owner since early September.

When officers forced their way into the home, they discovered the body of a woman - believed to be 33-year-old Tiffany Kain - in the late states of decomposition lying in a bedroom. Kain had spina bfida and was wheelchair-bound.Â

'It was like a house of horrors for Halloween,' said Holly Hill Police Chief Mark Barker. 'It was awful. You could smell the body from 150 feet away.'

But it was the presence of living bodies in the home that unsettled police the most.

Across the hall in another bedroom, they found Todd Christopher La Duke, 38, and Nicole Louise Scalise, 32, with their 4-year-old child. La Duke and Scalise had been living with Kain on and off for years.

Apparently they had been living in the house with the decomposing body. Two of their other children, ages 6 and 11, lived there as well but were at school at the time.

Making themselves at home: La Duke, Scalise and their three children were discovered living at this house in Holly Hill. The woman's body is believed to be that of 33-year-old Tiffany Krain who the family lived with on and off

Gruesome: In addition to the decomposing body, police found the house littered with dog feces and urine and evidence of drug abuse

In addition to the awful odors from the decomposing bodies, police also found dog feces and urine in the home and evidence of drug abuse in the form of bath salts.

'This is one of the worst cases of child neglect and child endangerment that I've seen in my 31 years here,' Barker said.

Both La Duke and Scalise admitted that they had been cashing in the dead woman's food stamps and Social Security benefits. However, they say they didn't know that Kain had died and assumed she left the home.

Both were arrested on charges of child neglect and failure to report a death to the medical examiner. La Duke is also being charged with theft of utility services since he illegally connected electrical and water service on the residence when it had been cut off.

Their three children are now in protective custody. Kain's death has been deemed suspicious by the police and an autopsy and toxicology report were ordered today.
