Drivers living in remote rural areas could receive a 5p a litre discount on the price they pay for petrol.

The mid-term review suggested ministers want to extend a scheme to cut fuel duty in areas which have been worst hit by prices hitting £1.40 a litre or more.

Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander has already introduced a 5p fuel duty discount in the Inner and Outer Hebrides, the Northern Isles, and the Isles of Scilly.

But the mid-term review revealed the Government is to consider extending it to remote mainland areas, too, such as Cornwall, the Scottish Highlands and North Wales.

‘We will consider the case for extending the rural fuel discount scheme to remote mainland communities,’ the document said.

A fuel duty discount can be introduced only if the Government can persuade the European Commission that it would not breach competition laws.

Precedents have been set by the French island of Corsica and Portuguese and Greek islands, which already enjoy fuel tax discounts approved by Brussels.

A Government source said: ‘The precedents are there in Greece and elsewhere. For the areas affected by these very high prices, it will be a significant cut.’

Another flagship transport policy signalled in the review, however, is causing significant splits within the Government.

The Coalition document mentioned only forthcoming plans for ‘long-term investment in Britain’s transport infrastructure’.

David Cameron is keen on plans to encourage private sector investment in the roads network by allowing them to charge tolls in return for building and running new motorways, trunk roads and lanes.

Drivers who use motorways and trunk roads could also pay a higher level of road duty, while those who stick to B-roads and single-lane A-roads would get a cut.

However, the Liberal Democrats – and Tory ministers in the Department for Transport – are understood to be cool on the proposal, arguing motorists are unlikely to welcome the idea of new tolls and charges.

A senior Government source admitted it was unlikely that significant progress would be made before the next election in 2015.

‘Have you seen how long it takes to build a new road in this country?’ the source said.
