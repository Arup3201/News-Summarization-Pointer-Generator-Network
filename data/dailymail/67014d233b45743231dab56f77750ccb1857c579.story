Tragic: Steve Herbert, 34, was found on the roadside in Hull at 6am on Wednesday and died hours later

Police have launched a manhunt to trace the killers of a young chef who was beaten to death when he tried to break up a fight on New Year's Day.

Father-of-two Steve Herbert, 34, was captured on CCTV acting as a peacemaker between his friends and a gang on a street before a fight broke out.

He was found at 6am on the roadside in Hull, East Yorkshire, by police and died hours later in hospital.

Today, two men, aged 21 and 22, and a 23-year-old woman have been arrested on suspicion of murder.

Four other men and a woman arrested yesterday have been released on bail.

Detectives claim the suspects were traced after the public responded to CCTV images released of suspects minutes before the attack.

The footage of a group walking towards the scene shows a man with spiky hair, a woman with long blonde hair 
and a distinctive handbag, and a couple - a man wearing a woolly hat, a 
hoody and a gilet accompanied by a woman wearing a short sleeved black 
dress with long dark hair.

A £5,000 reward remains on offer for any information that will lead to prosecution.

Detective Superintendent Christine Wilson, of Humberside Police’s major incident team, 
said: 'There was an altercation between the two groups and it looks like
 he was trying to be the peacemaker and calm things down and has been 
assaulted for his troubles.

'We have had a swift and
 positive response which has assisted us in identifying and arresting 
three people.

'The information coming in has been consistent in that
 people have been calling in giving the same names and we have followed 
up on that detail and continue to do so.'

She said they didn’t believe the two groups knew each other and that the attack seemed to be motiveless.

Suspects include a man in a woolly hat, a hoody and a gilet with a dark haired woman in a black dress

Tributes to Mr Herbert, father to two young daughters, have flooded in from friends and the local community.

Dawn Nagra, owner of Nu Bar in Hull, 
where Steve worked, said staff had been left devastated by his death and
 said he was 'the life and soul of the kitchen'.

He had recently enjoyed his first Christmas Day off in years and spent it with his long-term girlfriend and children.

The bar was closed on New Year’s Day after staff were told of his murder. 

Steve
 had been working there the night before when he told colleagues he 
planned to go to a party that night with family and friends.

His close friend Mark Holmes said he believed his friend was acting as a peacemaker.

'Over the years, we have been out drinking together many times and he has never been in any trouble,' he said.

'He
 was a happy person. He got on with everyone. I spoke to him a couple of
 days ago and he was the same as he always was, really happy.'

Det Supt Wilson said: 'His family have been left devastated by this awful attack.

'We
 have specialist officers supporting them, but they have lots and lots 
of questions about why this has happened. We are urging people to help 
us answer those questions by identifying the people seen on CCTV.

The release of the CCTV images has already led to eight arrests but police insist they require more information

A £5,000 reward remains on offer for information about the attack. Nu Bar, the workplace of Mr Herbert, father of two young girls, closed on Wednesday and paid tribute to the kindly chef

'As a result of studying CCTV we are now specifically looking to identify key witnesses and potential suspects.

'We
 have sourced both moving CCTV footage and stills which capture several 
individuals in the area, some of whom we have managed to speak to and 
others who we urge to come forward.'

The 
detective said: 'There is also moving footage which shows Mr Herbert 
with a group of friends which may help to jog people’s memories.

'Please 
contact us if you are able to identify anyone in the images, it is 
vitally important that we gather as much information as possible and we 
appeal to the public to help us to progress this investigation 
positively.

'We thank the public who have so far been very supportive and assisted 
greatly but we still need them to remain interested and consider whether
 they know anything of value to us.'
