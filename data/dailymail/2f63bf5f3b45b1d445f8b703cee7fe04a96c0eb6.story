Terrifying 911 tapes from a home invasion have been released, revealing chilling screams as young students in the house are bound at knife point by their attacker.

Eight women, aged 19 to 21, were in the house at the time of the attack in Seattle. One of them hid in her bedroom on the house's main floor and called 911, summoning police who arrested the man before any of the girls were injured.

Excerpts from the 911 calls give an insight into the frightening home invasion:

Dispatcher: '911, what are you reporting?

Caller: 'Hi, there is somebody in my house.'

She told the dispatcher that she heard a scream and then fighting.

Dispatcher: 'What`s going on?'

Caller: 'He`s taping her.'

Another student hiding in the corner bedroom of the same house also called 911. She too, told, the operator that a man was in her house and that he was threatening her roommates with a knife.

Caller: 'He`s threatening though.'

Dispatcher: 'What threats?'

Caller: 'I'll stab you.'

Caller: 'He`s taping her somewhere, I`m afraid he`s going to come find me.'

Dispatcher: 'We`ve got several officers. We got about four cars outside the house, OK? What do you think he`s doing to her?'

Caller: 'He`s taping her.'

Crime scene: Rapist Robert Douglas Hitt broke into a student home in Seattle but police managed to arrest him before anyone was hurt

Dispatcher: 'She`s hearing someone screaming from what part of the house?'

Caller: 'No, she only heard yelp. It sounds like he`s going around to all the different rooms and, like, yelling at people.'

Within minutes of the first 911 call, police were outside. The frantic caller then told the dispatcher she heard someone at the door.

Caller: 'My door`s open.'

Dispatcher: 'Did someone open the door or did you open it?'

Sound of women screaming...

Caller: 'They`re screaming, should I go?'

The screaming on the tape came as Seattle police officers stormed into the house. There they arrested Robert Douglas Hitt, 34.

Attacker: Robert Douglas Hitt was released from prison in January, allowing him to break into the student home and threaten the girls at knife-point

For Hitt’s previous first-degree rape conviction in 2002, he received an 'indeterminate sentence' with a minimum of 9.75 years in prison and a maximum of life.

Before the minimum sentences expire, certain sex offenders are required to be evaluated by the Indeterminate Sentence Review Board. An offender must be released unless the board determines the offender is more likely than not to commit another sex offence.

In February 2011, the board determined that Hitt was more likely than not to commit another sex offence if released from prison and another year was added to his minimum sentence.

However, six months later, the same board ruled that Hitt was releasable because he had completed a sex-offender treatment and 'worked hard to transform himself, his attitude and thoughts so that he won’t create another victim in the future,' according to the board’s decision.

Hitt was released Jan. 10 and was under lifelong supervision by the state Department of Corrections.

Now he is being held on robbery, burglary, kidnapping charges and unlawful imprisonment and for violating conditions of his release on his prior rape conviction. 

It is believed he entered the house after breaking a window, said Austen Beard, one of the women who lives there.

Beard, a 19-year-old student, was awakened around 3:30 a.m. Monday, when the man burst into her second-floor bedroom, and Beard, figuring he was a friend of her roommates, yelled at him to get out. He did, and she locked her door, then heard him yell, 'Get everyone in the house! I'm going to kill everyone!'

Moments later, one of her roommates knocked on her door and asked Beard to open it. She did and saw the man holding a knife to the roommate's throat, she said.

He rounded up six of the eight young women who live in the house, forcing them into an upstairs bedroom and ordering them to lie facedown in a row. He bound the wrists of the first three girls with electrical tape, but ran out, Beard said.

He then grabbed a table lamp and yanked out the cord, causing sparks to fly, in an apparent attempt to use the cord to tie up the remaining girls.

In the dark, Beard — whose hands hadn't yet been tied — grabbed the serrated kitchen knife the man had left within reach and hid it under her body. As he searched for more tape, Beard was able to pass the knife to the last woman in the line.

'He was very amateur. He was messed up,' Beard said of the suspect, who she thinks may have been under the influence of drugs.

'Every single girl that was involved, I'm so proud of,' Beard said, explaining that everyone kept their cool and worked together to get the knife away from the suspect.

One of the women was even able to wriggle out of the electrical tape while the others were cut free by officers.

'There will be some trauma for the next week, and people don't want to sleep in their own beds,' Beard said. 'But there's eight of us — we'll get through it.'
