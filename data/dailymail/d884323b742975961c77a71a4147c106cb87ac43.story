Harry Kane scored after just 79 seconds on his England debut as Roy Hodgson's side maintained their 100 per cent record in qualifying for Euro 2016.

Wayne Rooney hit the woodwork either side of a seventh-minute goal which edged him closer to Sir Bobby Charlton's all-time record of 49.

A deflected Danny Welbeck effort and Raheem Sterling's first Three Lions goal added extra gloss on a night which Kane will take the headlines.

The Spurs striker beat the Lithuania goalkeeper with a header as England claimed their fifth victory in as many Group E games.

England striker Harry Kane celebrates scoring the fourth goal with Danny Welbeck

England (4-3-3)  

Joe Hart 7

Had slightly more to do than expected but never looked anything but entirely in control.

Nathaniel Clyne 5.5

Started well, was really good at joining attacks – but Lithuania attacks, such as they were, came down the left side.

Gary Cahill 6

Did everything asked of him. Dealt with the very occasional dangers well. Tuesday night against Italy will tell us more

Welbeck (floor centre) claimed the second goal with a deflected header

Phil Jones 6

Hard to assess on a night of limited action – strong and resolute as expected, distribution satisfactory. Now first choice – if he seizes opportunity could be so for a decade.

Leighton Baines 5.5

Not sorely tested but not his best night; occasional lapses and poor cross/shot when he had a goal-scoring opportunity

Michael Carrick 7.5

A steadying influence and creative fulcrum at the base of the midfield – stay fit and he might turn into England’s key midfielder over the next 15 months.

England forward Welbeck was a constant worry for the Lithunian back four in Euro 2016 qualifier

Jordan Henderson 7

Seemed to enjoyed the more advanced role; his busyness paid off with his excellent drilled cross to create England’s second 

Rooney 8

Clearly intent on making this his night. Might have equalled Sir Bobby’s record within 18 minutes but had to settle for a sharp reflex header.

Welbeck 8.5

Justified selection in front of Kane: sharp, incisive, quick, a constant worry for the Lithuanian back four. Set up Rooney for opener and scored stooping header for second.

Aston Villa midfielder Fabian Delph impressed with an energetic and robust performance

Sterling 7.5

Never stopped showing for the ball, had his moments of guile and fine run and finish for his goal

Fabian Delph 7

Developing into a really good midfield option for England: energetic, robust. Occasional lapses in distribution but great lofted ball for Rooney’s early shot against post

Subs

Harry Kane 8

What an extraordinary season. The fairy tale line is becoming distinctly over-used but it’s difficult to find the superlatives to do his year justice

Ross Barkley 7

Played a lovely ball through to Baines shortly after coming on – looked bright in that attacking midfield role

Theo Walcott 6

Didn’t have long enough to make an impact but will be pleased to be back on the pitch with England

Manager

Roy Hodgson 7

Not starting with Kane was fully justified. System gave England width and pace and Welbeck was on fire. A good night for the England manager

Referee

Pavel Kralovec (Czech Rep) 6

Generally solid but the missed Welbeck penalty was his one blind spot on a quiet night.
