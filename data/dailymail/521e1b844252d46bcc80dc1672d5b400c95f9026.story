David Hayes, 58, was told he had cerebral palsy when he was five but as now found out he had a congenital deformity and has finally been treated

A man who has lived his whole life believing he has cerebral palsy after being diagnosed as a child has discovered more than 50 years later that he never had the condition.

David Hayes, 58, from Acomb, North Yorkshire, was told he had cerebral palsy when he was just five years old and has spent his life struggling to walk and using wheelchairs.

It was only when his son, Philip, 31, started feeling pain in his hip during cold weather five years ago that doctors quickly realised the condition may be a congenital deformity.

Now, almost half a century after he was first diagnosed, Mr Hayes has undergone knee and hip replacements , as well as an operation on his shoulder ball and socket, which has left him completely pain free.

Mr Hayes, the former national vice chairman of charity Scope, said: 'I couldn't walk until I was six and it was always very painful. I was sent to a special school as they thought I would never really be able to do anything.

'When I was eight they transferred me to mainstream school because they realised my intelligence appeared to be normal.

'I never let the condition I thought I had hold me back but I accepted that I would always be in pain and there was no cure.

'To find out that the condition I actually had could be treated was a dream come true.'

The father of two, who also has a daughter called Anne-Marie, said he owed a lot to the orthopaedic teams from York District Hospital who have operated on him over the last 12 weeks.

He said: 'I have two children and my son started having a pain in his left hip every winter. 

'After that it was obvious to doctors that it might be a congenital condition that I had passed down to him. They then realised it was operable.'

He said he now feels like the Six Million Dollar Man - the fictional television character who was given bionic implants - after the operations allowed him to walk without pain for the first time in his life.

He said: 'When I was a child I used to watch the programme, the Six Million Dollar Man, and I thought why they couldn't do that for me so I could walk? That's come true.

'The NHS has done that for me. There's a lot of knocking of the NHS but these were risky operations and for them all to be successful is remarkable.'

The father of two only found out he had a congenital deformity as opposed to cerebral palsy when his son Philip, 31, started suffering similar problems five years ago and doctors realised it could be a genetic issue

David Hayes, 58, was told he had cerebral palsy - a neurological condition which affects movement and co-ordination – when he was aged five.

He couldn’t walk until he was aged six and as he grew older he struggled to walk unaided and relied heavily on wheelchairs.

He was in a lot of pain and didn’t doubt his diagnosis as symptoms of cerebral palsy include muscle stiffness and weakness, balance and co-ordination problems and uncontrolled body movements - all issues he was suffering with.

There is no cure for the condition so Mr Hayes was forced to live with the diagnosis. 

However, when his son Philip, 31, started suffering from pain in his hip during cold weather five years ago, doctors realised the pair could be suffering from the same condition.

After ruling out that Philip was suffering from cerebral palsy, medics started to investigate his symptoms and realised he was suffering from a congenital deformity passed down from his father.

Congenital anomalies, which can result in long-term disabilities, are wide-ranging and in some cases – like the Hayes - can cause weak muscle tone and developmental delay.

During adulthood, individuals with a congenital deformity experience reduced sensation and weakness in their arms and legs, an abnormal curvature of the spine, impaired muscle co-ordination, and joint deformities.

David experienced these symptoms as a child but it wasn't until his son was genetically-tested that doctors realised they both shared the gene and that his symptom was hereditary instead of cerebral palsy. 

Having spent 15 years on the board of directors for Scope and four as national vice chair, Mr Hayes retired in 2007 due to his medical situation.

He also previously chaired North Yorkshire Police Independent Advice Group and now hopes to return to work to help 'pay the NHS back'.

His desire to return to work has seen him write to every police force in the country to inquire about employment opportunities.

He said: 'I want to work to pay the NHS back. What's the point in having all this done and sitting at home?'
