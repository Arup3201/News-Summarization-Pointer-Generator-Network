The 16-year-old boy who fell from a cliff in Sydney's northern beaches on Monday afternoon, will be in an induced coma when he turns 17 on Wednesday.

Blake Hayes was climbing a rope on the side of a cliff face in Turimetta Head near Warriewood Beach when he slipped on a loose rock and fell from a 10 metre height.

His mother, Prue Bowman, told Seven News that despite her son miraculously surviving the fall, he has 'a lot of life-threatening injuries'.

'He's got such a long path ahead until he's anywhere near recovered,' she said.

The teenager, who had been climbing up and down the rope with only his best friend Robin Keuning to access the notoriously dangerous Warriewood blowhole, was left immobile at the bottom of the cliff, waiting for paramedics to arrive.

Robin, who described the heart-stopping moment he watched his friend fall to the Sydney Morning Herald, said he'd called out to Blake to ask if he was OK and received only a 'no' in response.

'He [Blake] was going down a really steep hill, and it looked dangerous,' Robin told the Sydney Morning Herald.

'I had turned my back, and then I saw him slipping down, landing on his butt, and the next thing I see he's down.'

Five onlookers soon came to Blake's assistance shortly before the arrival of lifeguards from Warriewood Beach, who arrived via jet ski, and then finally paramedics.
