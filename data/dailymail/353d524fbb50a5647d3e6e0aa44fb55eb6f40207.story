A bout between Amir Khan and Floyd Mayweather would be one of the most hotly anticipated events in the sporting calendar.

But when it comes to which of the flashy boxers has the most valuable collection of watches, there is no contest.

Khan posted a picture to his Instagram on Thursday of six expensive-looking watches that he would be receiving from jewellers Frost of London after his next fight in December.

'My new jewelry pieces that are waiting for me for after the fight in December. Thanks to @josephfrostoflondon,' he wrote on Instagram. 

The six watches in the picture have a combined total cost of more than £250K, including an Audermars watch that is worth £117K on its own.

Not to be outdone, Mayweather previously shared a snap of his collection of 24 watches that includes eight of the Audermars brand and eight Rolexes.

Floyd Mayweather shared a picture of his watch collection that is worth more than £5m

And Sportsmail can reveal the total cost of these watches is more than £5million with a Jacob & Co Rainbow Tourbullion watch that would set you back an eyewatering £2.1m.

And these prices do not take into account the personal customisation of added diamonds that 'Moneyman' Mayweather insists upon.

So, while many people in the world of boxing would predict a close fight in the ring, when it comes to watches Mayweather blows Khan out of the water.
