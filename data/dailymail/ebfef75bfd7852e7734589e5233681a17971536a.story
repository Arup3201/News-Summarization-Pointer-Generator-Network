Bilel Mohsni was hit with a two-match ban for his bizarre diving headbutt on Scotland striker Chris Martin in the pre-season friendly at Derby.

The French-Tunisian centre-back will sit out Monday's Petrofac Training Cup tie with Hibs at Ibrox and Sunday’s Championship opener against Hearts for his moment of madness in Saturday’s 2-0 defeat by the English Championship side.

Rangers had been all but resigned to referee Mark Heywood including the astonishing red card in a formal report. That was promptly filed with the English FA, who immediately forwarded it to their disciplinary counterparts in Scotland. Mohsni’s dismissal in Derby was his third during 2014 and raised questions about his future at Rangers.

Off you go: Bilel Mohsni was hit with a two-match ban for his bizarre diving headbutt on Derby's Chris Martin

However, Ally McCoist has no plans to offload him and will instead try to help the 27-year-old calm his destructive temper.

The Rangers boss held talks with Mohsni on Sunday and insisted he wasn’t tempted to cash in after Abu Dhabi-based outfit Baniyas Sports Club saw an offer rejected earlier this summer.

Speaking before the ban was confirmed, McCoist said: ‘I don’t think we are in a position to get rid of players who will definitely be big parts of our season unless there is an automatic replacement who is better.

‘We speak about Bilel’s downside but he and Lee McCulloch scored in the region of 30 goals for us last season. That is from centre-back, so it’s a reasonable return.

‘But there is a problem and it’s one we are working to resolve. It is something that Bilel has had throughout his career. He knows he would be a far better player if he can get rid of it.

‘Whether it is count to 10 or walk away, it is something he is going to have to do.

‘This is the third time he has been sent off (at Rangers). I thought he was unlucky with the first one against Airdrie last season, but the other two were just flashes where he lost it.

I'm staying put! It is understood that Rangers boss Ally McCoist still wants to keep hold of his defender

‘The upsetting thing is that he is a really nice boy, great with the kids and supporters. But there is that flaw within him.’

Asked if a psychologist could be enlisted, McCoist added: ‘I’m not sure. I’m not qualified enough in that department to know if that would work or if he’d want it. What I do know is that he accepts totally he was wrong and let the boys down. We want to work to eradicate that problem.’

Honduran midfielder Arnold Peralta will also be absent tonight after McCoist revealed he is currently stranded in Paris dealing with visa issues.

Peralta was given extra time off this summer after he was forced to withdraw from his country’s World Cup squad with a thigh injury.

‘The mystery that is Arnold Peralta is definitely coming back — but when he is coming back, sadly, I can’t give you a definite on,’ added McCoist.

‘He has been in Paris trying to sort a visa and, if you are going to have problems, then I’d suggest Paris is the place to have them.

‘The good news is that Arnold is fit — the health issues are long gone. It’s just location issues now.’
