Japan is on bird-flu alert after two confirmed cases at a farm in the country's south where more than 1,000 chickens have died.

The slaughter of 112,000 chickens was today under way as efforts began to halt the spread of the highly pathogenic H5 virus after it was detected at a farm in Kumamoto prefecture.

Another 56,000 chickens will be killed at another nearby farm under the same ownership, while road blocks have been set up to prevent the spread of the virus any further.

Officials moved quickly to quash concerns of a possible spread to humans, saying there is no risk from cooked chicken or eggs. The H5N1 virus causes many of the same symptoms as most other types of flu, but develops fatal complications in more than half of cases.

The discovery marks the first bird flu case in Japan since 2011 when it was detected in Chiba prefecture, north of Tokyo, leading to the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of birds.

Yesterday Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga held a crisis meeting with ministers to discuss the outbreak.

'The government will take thorough measures to prevent wider infections,' he told the meeting, according to a report by AFP.

Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi added: 'As the initial response is key, we would like to closely coordinate with related ministries and Kumamoto Prefecture and take firm steps.'

Prefectural government employees don their protective suits. The scare comes after two chickens tested positive for avian influenza, the first outbreak of the virus in Japan since 2011

Kumamoto officials have already banned chicken farms within ten miles of the outbreak zone from moving any of their birds or eggs out of the zone.

Public health workers equipped with biohazard suits were meanwhile sanitising the areas around the affected farms while others tested birds at other nearby farms for signs of infection.

Road blocks have been set up to disinfect cars that have travelled through areas affected by the infection, to halt any further spread of the virus.

Bird flu affects many species of domesticated birds, including chickens, ducks, turkeys and geese, as well as wild birds, and is usually not transmitted from human to human.

However, when humans are infected it can quickly become very serious. Around half of people suffering confirmed cases of the H5N1 variant die from the illness, according to figures from the Word Health Organisation.

Like other types of flu, bird flu symptoms include a high temperature, aching muscles, a headache, cough and runny nose. But within days, sufferers may develop complications including diarrhoea, vomiting and chest pain acute which may eventually lead to respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure.

The virus is spread through direct contact with infected birds, an infected bird's droppings, or secretions from their eyes or respiratory tract, according to NHS Choices.

Anyone who has been involved in farming, slaughtering, butchering or preparing infected poultry could be at risk, although the virus is killed by heat and cannot be transmitted through cooked food.
