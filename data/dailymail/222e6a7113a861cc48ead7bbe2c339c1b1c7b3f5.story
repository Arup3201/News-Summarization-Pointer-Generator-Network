A mother-of-three is bidding to become Salford's answer to Fifty Shades of Grey author E.L. James after her latest racy novel climbed the charts.

M.A Stacie's erotic tale, Beneath the Surface, was released by the same publisher as the Fifty Shades author and looks set to be enjoying similar success.

The book has already performed well, rising to number 62 in the Amazon bestseller list.

Move over, E. L. James! M. A Stacie's erotic tale, Beneath the Surface, was released by the same publisher as the Fifty Shades author and Stacie, pictured with 6-year-old son Alfie, wants to see similar success

Stacie, 35, who lives in Swinton and works part-time at the Co-Operative Insurance, first began writing when she was 12 years old and a pupil at Buile Hill High School in Eccles.

She then went on to study English Literature at the former De La Salle Sixth form college and began writing 'fan fiction' on internet sites.

Her fifth book is set in the fictional town of Sea Point and tells the story of millionaire CEO Kyran Reese who is also an underground boxer.

The raunchy scenes between him and his brother's assistant in the book have led many people to dub her as Salford's answer to E. L. James.

Hobby: Stacie, who works part-time at the Co-Operative Insurance, first began writing when she was 12 years old

Though Stacie admitted she would love to emulate James' commercial success, she said their styles were very different.

'I started writing erotic books before Fifty Shades and I remember reading it when it was just a piece of fan fiction on a website.

'I'm delighted to see the genre has become so popular.

'There's huge potential as well because so many people are now reading books on Kindles and e-readers so there's no cover and no one else knows what they are reading.

'I love romantic novels and definitely see myself as more of a romantic novelist than an erotic one.'

Stacie is married to childhood sweetheart Shaun with whom she has three sons Mylo, 12, Alfie, six and Noah, 15 months.

Success: Stacie's book is already number 62 in 
the Amazon book charts. Though Stacie admitted she would love to emulate
James' commercial success, she said their styles were very different
