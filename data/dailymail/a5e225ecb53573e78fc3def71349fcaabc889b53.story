Hillary Rodham Clinton says that she has ‘moved on’ from the Monica Lewinsky scandal and even wishes the woman who had an affair with her husband well.

Former president Bill Clinton admitted that he had an ‘inappropriate relationship’ with Lewinsky when she interned at the White House in 1995 to 1996.

But Mrs Clinton, talking as her memoir Hard Choices hits the shelves, is seemingly putting the past behind her.

Moving on: Hillary Clinton has said that she wishes Monica Lewinsky well

In an interview with ABC, the former Secretary of State, said: ‘I have moved on, and that's how I see, you know, my life and my future.’

And when it was put to her that Lewinsky has complained about living her life ‘as a punchline’, Mrs Clinton said: ‘Well, I would wish her well. I hope that she is able to, you know, think about her future and construct a life that she finds meaning and satisfaction in.’

She added: ‘Forgiveness is a way of opening up the doors again and moving forward, whether it's a personal life or a national life.’

It was said that she’d referred to Lewinsky as a 'narcissistic looney toon' after the affair became public, but she refused to be drawn on this.

Mrs Clinton explained that she believes that over the years she’s become a ‘deeper, more understanding’ person.

Publicity drive: Clinton sat down with ABC to promote her memoir Hard Choices

If she does run for president again, Clinton said she 'would be working as hard as any underdog or any newcomer because I don't want to take anything for granted if I decide to do it.'

That said, the presumptive 2016 frontrunner indicated that she may not reenter politics because she's happy with the work she is doing now at the Clinton Foundation.

'I really like my life, I like what I’m doing,' she said. 'I’m thrilled about becoming a grandmother in the fall. I have lots of hopes – for what that means – to me and my family.'

'We have one life to live. This is -- this is it. It’s not a dress rehearsal,' Clinton said.

The comments come after her former boss - President Barack Obama - said he thinks she would be a 'very effective' president if she decides to run.

The President praised his former Secretary of State during an interview for Live with Kelly and Michael at the White House that aired last Friday.

'Hillary and I, we're buddies,' he said in the interview.
