The United States is preparing to send 200 combat troops to join 1,100 fighters in a large joint military
exercise this month in western Ukraine, as as fighting between the army and Russian-backed rebels rages in the eastern part of that country.

The decision to go ahead with the Sept. 16-26 'Rapid Trident' exercise is seen as a sign of the commitment of NATO states to support Ukraine – which is not a NATO member – while stopping short of
military intervention in the conflict.

The annual exercise, to take place in the Yavoriv training
center near Ukraine's border with Poland, was initially
scheduled for July, but was pushed back because early planning was
disrupted when Russian-backed separatists began a significant military invasion from the east.

'At the moment, we are still planning for (the exercise) to
go ahead,' U.S. Navy Captain Gregory Hicks, spokesman for the United States European Command (EUCOM), told Reuters on Tuesday.

NATO stepped up military activity in its eastern member
states after Russia's annexation of Crimea in March, and is
expected to agree at a summit in Wales this week to create a new
rapid reaction force of several thousand troops.

In addition to staging air force exercises, the U.S. is moving tanks and 600 troops to Poland and the Baltic
states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania for additional joint maneuvers in
October, replacing a more lightly armed force of paratroopers.

But Rapid Trident will entail the first significant 
deployment of U.S. and other personnel to Ukraine since the
crisis erupted.

President Barack Obama was in Estonia on Wednesday to
reassure the former Soviet Baltic states of that American support hasn't wavered; Estonia's prime minister called on Tuesday for a more visible
NATO presence in eastern Europe.

Washington has promised Ukraine $52 million in 'nonlethal' security aid, and has already provided combat rations, body
armor, radios and other equipment.

Pentagon leaders have met
with their Ukrainian counterparts to discuss a range of options for cooperation. But for now, supplying lethal military hardware is off the table.

'It is very important to understand that a military solution
to this problem is not going to be forthcoming,' President Barack Obama told
reporters at the White House last week.

EUCOM says the exercise
this month will involve about 200 U.S. personnel along with 1,100 others from Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Britain, Canada, Georgia,
Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Norway, Poland, Romania and
Spain.

Focused on peacekeeping, it will include command post
drills, patrolling and dealing with improvised explosive
devices.

While it involves many NATO members as well as countries
such as Ukraine, who are part of NATO's broader 'Partnership for
Peace,' the exercise is not formally a NATO drill.

More broadly, under a broad program titled 'Operation
Atlantic Resolve' meant to show U.S. commitment to the European 
allies, NATO is running what officials say is a ramped up
version of its regular summer and autumn training schedule.

Obama has announced a series of ever-increasing U.S-backed economic sanctions designed to financially cripple Russian President Vladimir Putin and his circle of close allies from the country's aristocratic and business class.

A tougher blow came Wednesday, as France decided to postpone delivery of the first of two warships Russia had ordered as part of a $1.6 billion deal. 

French President Francois Hollande's office said in a statement that 'despite the prospect of a ceasefire which still remains to be confirmed and implemented, the conditions for France to deliver the first warship are not, to date, in place.'

Putin has amped up his rhetoric in recent days, telling outgoing European Commission President José Manuel Barroso on Tuesday that Kiev, Ukraine's capital, would be an easy conquest for him if he wanted it.

The Italian newspaper La Repubblica reported that he told Barroso,'If I want, I'll take Kiev in two weeks.'
