Olympic cycling champion Anna Meares suffered a tough day at the Commonwealth Games on Sunday after she was beaten by teammate Stephanie Morton and was then forced to endure an interview with her former arch rival Victoria Pendleton.

Meares came second in the women's sprint track race against 23-year-old Morton, who finally dethroned her in Glasgow.

The 30-year-old appeared tearful on the podium after Morton insisted she joined her on the top step to sing the Australian national anthem arm-in-arm.

Meares was then approached for an interview by British cycling star Pendleton, with whom she shared a long and fierce rivalry that culminated in a legendary showdown at the 2012 London Olympics.

'There were rumours flying that this was your last championship, please tell me they are just rumours?,' Pendleton asked after commenting on Meares' emotional appearance.

The retired Olympian was reporting for for BBC 5 Live Sport at the velodrome in Glasgow.

'I'm a little stunned that you are here actually, I didn't expect to see your face here,' Meares laughed awkwardly.

'It was very emotional. Steph broke me on the podium, I wanted to happily stand in my place on second spot but she insisted I stand with her for the anthem,' she said.

'I don't know if I'll get to another Commonwealth Games, I'm aiming for Rio,' she added.

The pair put any tension aside to pose for a photo in front of the track, which Meares posted on Twitter.

The pair were arch rivals for years, including some high-profile race incidents that contributed to some bad blood between the cyclists

Meares famously beat Pendleton on her home patch when she emerged victorious in the sprint final two years ago in London. Meares on that occasion played the spoiler for the retiring Pendleton who, in an act of sportsmanship, embraced the Australian during her victory lap to bury the hatchet.

Their rivalry stretches back many years and has at times flared up on the world stage.

Meares tried to run Pendleton off the track during a keirin race in France in 2006, but the Briton got her own back two years later when she won the gold Medal in Beijing.

Eyebrows were again raised when Pendleton crashed out during a duel in Melbourne in 2009 but backed up to score a bittersweet victory in the decider.

She then accused Meares and a hostile Melbourne crowd of bad sportsmanship.

'I hate the rivalry, absolutely hate it, mainly because it has turned into something which sounds bitter and nasty, and I don’t like the idea,' she said in 2012, according to The Mirror.

'I didn't like the way her crowd in Melbourne were all quiet when I was up and jeering when I had won. I hate that negative side of it - what happened to good sportsmanship?'

Speaking after Monday morning's race - the first time the old rivals have spoken since London - it was clear the pair had long forgotten the past when Pendleton told Meares: 'I really enjoyed watching you up there'.

'Sometimes I fall short and get a silver medal like I did tonight,' Meares said.

'Mate, there is no shame in a silver medal if anyone knows I know that,' Pendleton replied.

'Couldn't believe seeing this face again on the other side of the fence tonight So good 2 see u @v_pendleton @bbc5live,' she wrote.

Meares previously praised Pendleton when she beat her at the London 2012 Olympic Games.

She told journalists after her win it gave them a 'break from being so tentative towards each other'.

'Last night Victoria showed great sportsmanship. It would have been very difficult to have been beaten in front of a home crowd, especially one as patriotic and as loud as that,' she said.

The pair showed there were no hard feelings between them as they kissed on the podium

Meanwhile, on Sunday night Morton said after her win 'there is really nothing between me and Mearesy, we’re really good friends off the track and I have the utmost respect for her on the track as well, and we’ll probably ride home (to the village) together.'

The pair are sharing a room together at the athletes' village in Glasgow.

Australia is currently at the top of the medal tally at the Commonwealth Games, overtaking England with a tally of 20 golds, 14 silver and 22 bronze.
