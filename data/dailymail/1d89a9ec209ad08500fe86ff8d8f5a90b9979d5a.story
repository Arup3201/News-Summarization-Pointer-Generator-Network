Former Australian Open finalist Marcos Baghdatis leads the cast of Wimbledon wild card entries, with British hopes Dan Evans, James Ward and Dan Cox included.

Promising British teenager Kyle Edmund receives a wild card entry for the second year running, despite not falling inside the world's top 250 ranking berths.

The policy of the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) is to propose British players ranked 250 or higher in the world, leaving Cypriot Baghdatis and 19-year-old Edmund the exceptions.

Brit Dan Smethurst squeezes in by virtue of sitting 243rd in the world, with two further wild card places yet to be confirmed for the men's singles.

Baghdatis saw off Marinko Matosevic to claim his first singles title since 2010 with victory in the Nottingham Aegon Classic last week.

British trio Naomi Broady, Tara Moore and Samantha Murray have been handed entries into the ladies' singles draw, with Czech Kristyna Pliskova also on the list.

There are four further women's singles wild cards yet to be confirmed. British duo Heather Watson and Johanna Konta are direct entries through ranking.

American prospect Taylor Townsend is yet to receive a wild card entry, despite reaching the girls' juniors finals last year.

The 18-year-old reached the third round of the French Open, and is thought to be in the running to be added to the wild card roster in due course. Last year's girls' tournament winner Belinda Bencic has already qualified on raking.
