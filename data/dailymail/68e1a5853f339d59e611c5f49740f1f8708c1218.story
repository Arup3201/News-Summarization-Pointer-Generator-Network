Take a deep breath.

A Japanese robotics expert has built the world's first real-life, working Transformer.

Children of the Eighties will remember the Transformers toy range and cartoon as one of the most iconic of its era.

But, until now, working versions have been unavailable.

Robots in disguise: Kenji Ishida, a hobby robot research from Kashiwa, Japan, has built the world's first working Transformer-type toy - a dream come true for many men who grew up during the Eighties

Strong enough to break the bravest heart: Mr Ishida's robot converts from a 1/12 scale remote controlled car into a walking, rocket launcher wielding robot hero in a matter of seconds

Kenji Ishida, a hobby robot 
researcher from Kashiwa, in Japan's Chiba Prefecture, is the first to build and market a 
remote-control car that is 'more than meets the eye'.

The robot, which appears not to be endorsed in any way by Transformers' maker Hasbro, and is simply called Transform Robot Version 7.2, can convert from a cool looking 1/12 scale RC car into a robot hero in seconds.

And that's not all, it also comes equipped with a rocket launcher in each arm, working lights, and a WiFi camera that allows users to follow its exploits.

Controlled by what appears to be a modified Playstation joypad, it transforms from a car into a robot and back again in seconds.

It is able to both walk on two legs and, just like any other RC car, drive on its four wheels.

The WiFi camera transmits a view of the world as seen by the robot to any internet-connected device like a PC or tablet so that the owner can get a totally immersive experience.

But this is just the start of the research. By 2030, Mr Ishida hopes to build his first full-size, fully working transforming robot that humans can ride.

Plans: The Transform Robot Version 7.2 is the product of a decade of research by Mr Ishida's company Brave Robotics

The toy will be a dream come true for many men who grew up in the Eighties and early Nineties when the Transformers franchises offered what were among the coolest and most imaginative toys available.

Beginning with the Transformers toy line, the franchise centres on factions of transforming alien robots - the Autobots and the Decepticons - in an endless struggle for dominance or eventual peace.

In its decades-long history, the original Japanese idea has expanded to encompass comic books, animation, video games and films. It remains popular to this day.

fully working transforming robot that humans can ride by 2030

The Transform Robot Version 7.2 is the product of a decade of research by Mr Ishida's company Brave Robotics.

He has offered a limited run of just 10 of the robots for sale, but a one-month wait for shipping means even if you order today its unlikely to make its way from Japan in time for Christmas.

But if you ordered today, you might just get lucky.

Mr Ishida is said to be preparing to showcase his remarkable invention next week at Maker Faire Tokyo 2012.

According to reports, the body of the latest robot and various other parts have been 3D printed, holding the promise that one day soon it could enter mass production.
