Manuel Pellegrini hit out at the performance of England’s most senior referee, Mark Clattenburg, claiming that his performance cost Manchester City a win over Arsenal, saying that he had missed two fouls from which Arsenal scored and a clear penalty for City.

The City manager also implied it would be difficult to retain the title given the hurdles that were being put in front of the team and drew attention to the fact that Clattenburg had also missed a City penalty in the 3-2 defeat against Liverpool last April, a game which at the time looked as if it would cost City the title.

The clash between the Premier League’s leading referee and the manager of the title holders is sure to become a theme of the season, with Clattenburg likely to referee many of the showpiece games.

Pellegrini claimed that Clattenburg had missed a foul on Sergio Aguero for Arsenal’s first goal, a push on Vincent Kompany for the second and a handball in the area by Jack Wilshere with the score at 2-1 to Arsenal, though all three decisions appeared marginal calls.

Pellegrini said: ‘I’m very satisfied with the point. It’s a good point when they scored two illegal goals. The first goal was unbelievable. The referee didn’t want to whistle [for the foul on Aguero] and the second goal was a clear push by Welbeck on Kompany when he cleared the ball with the head.

‘We finished with a clear penalty, both hands, twice handled by Wilshere inside the box in front of the linesman. It was as clear as last season against Liverpool, with Skrtel’s fist inside the box. It was with the same referee.’

Pellegrini was referring to a punch Martin Skrtel made at the end of Liverpool’s win last season but insisted he did not have a personal agenda against Clattenburg. ‘I don’t have a problem with him,’ he said. ‘He had a very bad day against Liverpool and today he had a very bad day. Arsenal scored both goals with fouls so he cost us our victory.

‘But I’m very happy with the way my team played. Szczesny had to make two very good saves at the end.’

Pellegrini added he felt forced to substitute Sergio Aguero after 67 minutes because he had already received a yellow card and feared with the referee his striker would get sent off.

Arsene Wenger said: ‘There were situations where there was a real fight for the ball and we made a foul and they made a foul and the referee decided to let it go. I don’t think that explains why we scored after, because there was a lot to do after that!’
