A sheriff has refused to fly the U.S. flag at half-mast today in honor of Nelson Mandela because the late South African leader is 'not an American'.

Rick Clark, the sheriff in Pickens County, South Carolina, posted a message on Friday saying that he would ignore President Obama's executive order intended as a mark of respect to Mandela, a leader regarded globally as an inspiration for leading South Africa out of apartheid. 

Sheriff Clark's Facebook message appears to have since been removed, but it read: 'Nelson Mandela did great things for his country and was a brave man but he was not an AMERICAN!!!'

Rick Clark (pictured left), the sheriff of Pickens County, South Carolina, is refusing to lower the flag to half-staff to honor the life of Nelson Mandela

The American flag flies at half-staff above the White House in honor of South African leader Nelson Mandela on December 6

He said that the flag would be lowered to honor a local officer who had died and also to mark the remembrance of Pearl Habor on Saturday.

There is no penalty for ignoring an executive order to lower a flag to half-mast.  There are also precedents for foreigners being honored by the lowering of the American flag.

In 1965, President Johnson issued an order to lower flags to half-mast following the death of British prime minister Winston Churchill. George W. Bush lowered flags following the death of Pope John Paul II in 2005.

Nelson Mandela died on December 5 at the age of 95 in Johannesburg.

Sheriff Clark wrote that he believes the American flag should be lowered at the U.S. Embassy in South Africa. He told Fox: 'It's just my simple opinion that the flag should only be lowered to half-staff for Americans who sacrificed for their country.

'I have no problem lowering it in South Africa in their country but not for our country. It should be the people who have sacrificed for our country.

He added: 'I think it's great in America we can disagree.'

Sheriff Clark's Facebook post appears to have been taken down after it was posted on Friday

The sheriff then followed up on Saturday with the message: 'Well the news/Facebook cycle has run its course. Time to move onto the next subject because I have work to do for my community and need to devote my time elsewhere.

'Thank you for your support and comments. I urge you to read about President Mandela over the next few days of mourning and be inspired for public service for your community and the nation as he was. It Pearl Harbor Day and thank a veteran today if you can.'

There was support for the sheriff's actions on his Facebook page from local people.

Brian Davis posted: 'I agree and you did the right thing.... Just saying.'

Dana Kelly wrote: 'I appreciate working for you knowing that you're not a ''yes man''. This country was founded with strong backbones and seems a lot of folks have lost sight of this. Thank you Sheriff.'

Deanna Counts added: 'Rick, you do what is right no matter what anyone else says! Make us proud. Our flag is for our citizens and our country!'

President Obama headed for South Africa on Monday to attend a national memorial service for anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela.

Along with First Lady Michelle, the President boarded Air Force One under cold, rainy skies for the long flight. The occasion presented an opportunity for a rare get-together of American presidents. Former President George W. Bush was already on board the plane, along with former first ladies Laura Bush and Hillary Clinton.

Tributes are left at the Nelson Mandela statue in Parliament Square, London. Millions around the world have honored the former South African president who was revered globally as an icon of courage and peace

Former President Bill Clinton was traveling separately from Rio de Janeiro, where he was attending a Clinton Global Initiative event. And former President Jimmy Carter also planned to join the group in Johannesburg.

George H.W. Bush is the only living president who will not attend. His spokesman said the 89-year-old no longer is able to travel long distances.

The American leaders will join dozens of other dignitaries and tens of thousands of mourners at the memorial service at a Johannesburg stadium. Mandela will be buried December 15, following a state funeral in his hometown of Qunu.

Millions around the world have laid tributes outside of South African embassies and joined public remembrance services in honor of Mandela.
