Finnish authorities take a very dim view of speeding, as they showed when they fined one driver a staggering £40,000 for going just 14mph over the limit.

The colossal sum was demanded because in Finland, fines for speeding are scaled up according to the wealth of the law-breaker – and this one, businessman Reima Kuisla, is a multi-millionaire.

After he was caught travelling at 64mph in a 50mph zone, the authorities took a peek at his tax return.

Reima Kuisla posted a picture of his speeding ticket on his Facebook page, complaining that the Finnish authorities were making life for the rich difficult

It showed that he earned 6.5m euros (£4.72m) a year, so they dished out a 54,000 euro fine, the Iltalehti newspaper reported.

The fine has a logic to it, but Mr Kuisla complained bitterly on his Facebook page about the sum he was asked to hand over.

He posted a picture of the ticket and said: ‘Finland is impossible to live in for certain kinds of people who have high incomes and wealth. I’m considering leaving the country.’

However, sympathy levels in Finland for his plight have been fairly low.

One user wrote on the Iltalehti website: ‘He should stop complaining and hang his head in shame instead.’

Earlier this week a British tourist who teaches UK police driving skills was fined for speeding in New Zealand after telling a court his father had been 'caught short' and he was taking him urgently to a toilet.

Peter Lee, 46, from Kent, had been clocked at 110mph in a 60mph zone near Hokitika, south of Greymouth, on the South Island - and when he appeared before a Queenstown Court today Judge Michael Crosbie appeared surprised to learn the driver instructed UK police.

'I'm a driving instructor whose work includes teaching driving skills to serving and retiring police officers,' Lee told the court after being asked to explain his work back in England.
