Jack Cottle, 22, admitted driving a VW Polo onto the Brands Hatch track in Kent

A prankster faces jail after admitting driving a Volkswagen Polo at high-speed on to the Brands Hatch circuit during a race.

Jack Cottle, 22, hit speeds of up to 100mph with two passengers on board after gatecrashing an endurance race at the famous track in Kent on June 14.

Maidstone Crown Court heard he performed the stunt after being dared by friends in a 'foolish prank', putting the lives of racers in danger.

Cottle, from Durgates in Wadhurst, East Sussex, pleaded guilty to 'causing a nuisance to the public by driving on to the race track at Brands Hatch whilst an endurance race was in progress'. 

The 1.2litre car belonged to his friend Saskia Fisk, 18, who was in the car with him at the time. 

His other friend, Zac Copson, 20, videoed the events on his mobile phone from the back seat as Miss Fisk screamed at him to stop. 

Cottle is seen driving into the circuit, bypassing security checks, and is seen going past mechanics in what looks like a pit lane before making his way on to the track itself.

In the clip, Cottle, wearing a black T-shirt, says 'we’re going onto the track'.

Miss Fisk, who is clutching a pair of large pink novelty glasses in the passenger seat, says: 'Jack please, I’m begging you, I’m serious, don’t go, stop it, come on.'

But he ignores her terrified pleas and she is heard screaming and begging him to stop and at one point says ‘I can’t breathe’.

She also tries to grab the steering wheel a couple of times as her voice becomes more hysterical.

At the time of the incident, Cottle told MailOnline: 'People are blowing it out of all proportion. It was something out of the ordinary.

'You only live once and I live every day like it is my last. Now I'm getting slated for being different.'

Speaking shortly after the incident took place, Miss Fisk said that she had set off in her white VW Polo 1.2 to the track near West Kingsdown, Kent, a 20-minute drive from her family’s £625,000 detached home in Sevenoaks, after asking her parents’ permission. 

Her frightening experience began 90 minutes into the four-hour endurance race for VW Beetles on June 14.

She told the Daily Mail at the time: ‘We were sitting in the car watching the race and they got bored and said wouldn’t it be funny if we raced round the track. I was like, “Yeah, it’d be really funny”. But I didn’t think they’d do it. Even when we were in the paddock I was saying stop. I begged him to stop.

‘I’m angry they’re saying I was egging them on. I was panicking and screaming. I was praying he would stop on the pit lane.’ 

Unbeknown to the men, Miss Fisk suffers from postural tachycardia syndrome which affects blood pressure. She said medics at the track had to calm her down. 

Prosecutor Keith Yardy told the court on Friday: 'Shortly before 4pm on June 14 this year, the race had been going for some three hours when the defendant drove a Volkswagen Polo into the pit lane with two passengers.  

The 22-year-old now faces a custodial sentence after committing the prank after being dared by friends

Prosecutor Keith Hardy said Cottle clearly put  'the race drivers at risk and endangering their safety'

At the time, Cottle defended his actions and said 'people are blowing it out of all proportion. It was something out of the ordinary'

'He then entered the race track during the race, clearly putting the race drivers at risk and endangering their safety.

'As a result of his actions, the race was brought to a stop. He was interviewed. He said he was dared to do it and was sorry but would do it again.'

Judge Martin Joy warned Cottle that a 'custodial sentence is on the cards' when he next appears in court on the week beginning November 17.

Defence counsel Ailsa Williamson said Cottle was 'an immature man' but had the support of his family who attended court with him.

She said: 'He was dared by friends. This was a foolish prank that should never have gone this far and he deeply regrets his actions.'

Adjourning the case for a pre-sentence report before freeing Cottle on conditional bail, Judge Joy again warned him that a custodial sentence would be considered.

The judge said: 'Motor racing is an inherently dangerous sport and quite plainly it was a matter that put persons at risk for their lives. You must understand that the court will be considering a custodial sentence.'

Miss Fisk says 'Jack please, I’m begging you, I’m serious, don’t go, stop it, come on' as he laughs
