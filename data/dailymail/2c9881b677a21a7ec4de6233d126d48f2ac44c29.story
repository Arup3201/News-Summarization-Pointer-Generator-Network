A team of exterminators have been called into a school to fumigate classrooms which have been infested by Britain's most venomous spider.

Dean Academy in Lydney, Gloucestershire was forced to close its doors after reports of 'rapidly multiplying' false widow spiders in the school.

All 905 pupils and the entire staff at school were given the day off as the white-suited team entered the building with the job of killing off the dangerous arachnids.

They worked through the night and into this morning in a bid to eradicate the outbreak.

The spiders, which have a nasty bite, had been found in the computer block and other buildings at the school.

Dozens of people have been injured as the spiders spread across the country with symptoms including severe swelling, chest pains and tingling of fingers.

School Vice Principal Craig Burns said no pupils had been bitten by the spiders but health and safety officials had recommended the closure for the day.

With the building empty, extermination teams fumigated areas of the school where sightings of the spiders had been reported.

The decision to close was backed by parents yesterday, although some voice concerns about the chemicals used in the extermination.

Carer Julia Mullan, mother of 15 year-old pupil Connor, said: 'I’m happy that they’ve closed the school for the day as it shows that they are looking out for the kids safety.

'One thing I am worried about though is the chemical residue that will be left behind.'

Another mother, Trudi Shattock, 40, also voiced concern about the chemical residue that could be left behind.

Mrs Shattock, who works at an opticians, said: 'I think it should be closed for the rest of the week because I’m worried about what the left over chemicals might do to the children.

'It’s half term next week so I don’t see why they don’t just call it an early finish and sort the problem out.

'They’ve definitely done the right thing to close the school - I’d be worried about the children’s safety if they left the spiders there.

Mr Burns said the decision had been taken in the best interests of the students’ health and safety - and stressed that there had been no reports of anyone being bitten by spiders.

In a letter, he wrote: 'We identified an issue with ‘false widow’ spiders in the academy in our ICT block yesterday afternoon and therefore took immediate advice from pest control.

'We therefore made the decision to close the ICT block for the whole of today so that pest control could fumigate the area.

'Unfortunately, there have been further ‘false widow’ spiders identified in other areas of the academy.

'We have taken advice from the health and safety unit at Gloucestershire Local Authority and C&D Pest Control, Chepstow, and have taken the decision to close the academy all day on October 23.

'This will enable pest control to fumigate every area in the academy and ensure everyone’s health and safety.

'The health and safety unit and pest control feel that we have dealt with the matter quickly and efficiently and taken appropriate early action. 

'There have been no reports of anyone being bitten by the ‘false widow’ spiders at the academy but if you have any concerns please seek medical advice.

'Any pre-planned meetings, sports fixtures or extra-curricular activities will not take place. The academy will be open as normal on October 24.

'Please accept my sincere apologies for any inconvenience this may cause you but I’m sure you will understand that this is in the best interest of students’ health and safety.'

The false widow is about the size of a 50p coin and is the most dangerous of the 12 species of biting spider known in Britain.

There have been no reported deaths from its bite in the UK.

Symptoms can include severe swelling, chest pains and tingling of fingers, with the severity depending on the amount of venom injected.

of his injury and a jar containing a spider, was bitten on the toe by 
the spider while making a bonfire at his home in Bromley, Kent, last 
year

The species was first spotted in the UK in Torquay, Devon, in 1879.

Also known as steatoda nobilis, it is frequently confused for the black widow, which has deadly venom.

It is understood that it may have made its way to these shores from Madeira or the Canary Islands in a shipment of bananas.

The species has a brown bulbous abdomen with cream markings that look like a skull.

They have long legs and can reach about 15mm in size.

The Natural History Museum says that warmer summers mean the spider is spreading northwards through the UK, having been found mainly in southern England.

This theory is backed by its wildlife surveys where people report sightings to them.

The
 false black widow, which is said to be spreading further north due to 
warmer weather, has the worst bite of any spider in the UK.

There have been a spate of bites reported across the country in the past few weeks.

Amateur Devon footballer Steve Harris, for instance, had to undergo emergency surgery after a bite on his leg last week.

The spider is a cousin of the black widow and is about the size of a 50p piece.

It delivers venom that can kill those who are allergic to it.

It first came to the UK more than 100 years ago in crates of fruit from the Canary Islands.

The
 Natural History Museum’s Insect Information Service hears of about ten 
cases of spider bites each year, although no one in the UK has ever died
 as a result of one.

The
 distribution of the false widow spider is expected to increase 
northwards in the UK due, at least partly, to mild summers in recent 
years.
