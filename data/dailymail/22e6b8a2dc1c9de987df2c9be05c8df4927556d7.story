A charity which received £50,000 in donations to fund specialist brain tumour treatment for a five-year-old boy has refused to hand over the cash because the NHS agreed to pay for the therapy.

Kids n Cancer collected donations of around £50,000 from people supporting the plight of Ashya King, who was diagnosed with a brain tumour. 

His parents sparked an international manhunt and were eventually arrested in Spain after they took him out of hospital and fled the country earlier this year in search of better treatment which was not funded by the NHS.

The charity says the money was donated for the specialist treatment, proton beam therapy at a clinic in Prague, to treat Ashya's tumour. However it said as the NHS had now decided to fund the therapy, the cash will be spent on other children who need treatment.

Ashya's older brother Naveed Kids n Cancer have labelled his family 'greedy' and said the charity had never given them money and was refusing to help.

The family said they believe as the money was donated to Ashya's cause they should now receive it to help cover their extensive legal costs. 

These were incurred when they were arrested and held in Spain for fleeing with their son. 

'We have asked Kids n Cancer to support us with paying for the legal fees involving the custody and the release of my parents from prison as well as living expenses whilst we are in Prague,' Naveed, 20, wrote on Facebook. 

 'Kids n Cancer came back with a reply saying that they were not willing to help us, they said we are greedy asking for help... Kids N Cancer have never given us any money and they are refusing to help us now.'

Brett and Naghemeh King fled Southampton General Hospital with their son Ashya in September because they were concerned about the side effects of treatment he was to receive in the UK. 

They researched alternatives and found proton beam therapy, available in Prague.

The NHS said it would not fund the therapy and the Kings fled to Spain, where they planned to sell a house to raise the money to have Ashya treated in Prague.

When it was noticed they had fled, Hampshire Police issued a European Arrest Warrant and the couple were held by police in Malaga in Spain. Ashya was taken to hospital and the Kings were told none of the family could visit him.

The couple were held in prison for 72 hours before a international outcry- including criticism of the 'heavy handed' treatment from Prime Minister David Cameron - led judges to order they should be released.

Following tests Ashya was deemed suitable for proton beam therapy, and the NHS agreed to fund the treatment on September 26. He has since started treatment at the clinic in Prague.

Proton beam therapy is a type of radiotherapy which causes less damage to surrounding tissue. Instead of firing high energy beams of radiation at tumours, protons (sub-atomic particles) are used and stop when they reach cancer cells. 

The makeup of protons mean they are less likely to disperse widely and affect surrounding tissue. This treatment is not routinely funded by the NHS.

Kids n Cancer said while it had been prepared to meet the £100,000 cost of the treatment in Prague, because the money had been donated specifically for the therapy this would now be used to help other children in similar need.

The charity said it was not able to use the money to cover the legal costs incurred by the family because this was not part of the charity's aims. It said Kids n Cancer exists to fund proton beam therapy to help children and their families, and no where did it state that legal costs would or could be covered by donations.

Mike Hyman, chief executive officer of Kids n Cancer, said: 'There are many, many families who do not get the sort of donations that the Kings have had.

'The Just Giving Page was set up by Sanjay Gunatra, who specified that now the treatment has been paid for that the donations will go towards helping other sick children and their families.'

He added: 'There has obviously been a significant amount of money raised and I reiterate that Kids n Cancer were prepared to underwrite £100,000 to pay for Ashya King’s treatment.' 

Ashya was diagnosed with a brain tumour at the end of July and after several operations was to have chemotherapy and radiotherapy at Southampton General Hospital. But his parents were concerned that this would leave him in a semi-vegetative state.  

Mrs King has previously said her son was left scarred by the experience, and now fears every time his parents leave the room that they will be leaving him again.
