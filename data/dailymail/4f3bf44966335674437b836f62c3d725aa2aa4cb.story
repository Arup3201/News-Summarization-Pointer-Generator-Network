A Watford football fan is fighting for his life after suffering serious injuries in an attack in the street as he made his way home from yesterday's match against Wolves.

The supporter, named locally as 44-year-old Nick Cruwys, was on his way to Wolverhampton train station from the Molineux stadium when he was assaulted by a gang.

The man was walking to the station with a group of friends when they were 'completely outnumbered', police said.

Both Watford and Wolves football clubs, who drew yesterday afternoon's Championship clash 2-2, expressed their shock at the attack.

A statement on Watford's website said: 'The thoughts of everyone associated with Watford FC are with a Hornets' supporter - at yesterday's game - who is now critically ill after an unprovoked post-match attack.' 

Wolves chief executive Jez Moxey said: 'We are deeply saddened to hear of this incident and our thoughts go out to the supporter concerned and his family.

'As a club we deplore any violence in or around football matches and we will work closely with the relevant authorities to help bring the perpetrator, or perpetrators, to justice.

'All right-minded football supporters will share in our disgust at this violent incident and I would implore anyone with any information to contact the police.'

The 'unprovoked attack' came after Wolves (in orange) and Watford (in black) drew 2-2 at the Molineux

A West Midlands Police spokesman said: 'Detectives have launched an investigation after a Hertfordshire man received life-threatening injuries in an unprovoked assault in Wolverhampton yesterday.

'The 44-year-old was with a group of friends making their way to the train station to return home to Hemel Hempstead just after 5pm when they were attacked in Little's Lane.'

Detective Sergeant Adam Keen added: 'The group of friends were completely outnumbered and the victim suffered a severe head injury which has left him in a critical condition in hospital.

'His family have been informed and we are in the process of taking statements from witnesses and locating any CCTV which might have captured those responsible for the attack.

'I would urge anyone with information which will help our investigation to contact me as soon as possible on 101.' 

Police also urged anyone wishing to offer information anonymously to call the Crimestoppers hotline on 0800 555 111.
