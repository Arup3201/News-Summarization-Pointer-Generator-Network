Comedian Tommy Cooper loved a good pun

Heard the one about Cadbury’s introducing an Oriental chocolate bar to its range? Could be a Chinese Wispa. 

That’s not my joke. It belongs to comedian Rob Auton and it has just won the annual award for Funniest Joke at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, as voted for in a public poll. 

But it’s also, like most of the Top Ten gags in the poll, a pun — an old-fashioned, straightforward play on words. 

Indeed, it’s so old-fashioned that I can remember my sister reading out a similar joke from Smash Hits magazine in the Eighties: ‘Why did George Michael have chocolate on his face?’ — ‘He was Careless with his Wispa’. 

Is Rob Auton’s line really the funniest joke of the year?

There’s probably two dozen equally good puns in the average edition of Radio 4’s I’m Sorry I Haven’t A Clue.

But puns always dominate the Edinburgh list, because they require no context.

They’re always quotable (and Tweetable) in a way that other jokes, requiring a long set up or an element of visual humour, may not be.

Last year’s winner was ‘I’ll tell you who gives kids a bad name: Posh and Becks.’

It wasn’t particularly ground-breaking, it was perhaps a little out of date, but it had immediate, widespread appeal.

The runner-up was Tim Vine’s ‘Crime in multi-storey car-parks — that’s wrong on so many different levels’, which, for me, is a better joke.

You only have to look at Twitter, or read the headlines in the tabloids,  or listen to gags being told in pubs and playgrounds up and down the country, to realise that we Brits love puns.

Great writers: Chaucer loved puns while Shakespeare could never resist them

They have been embedded in British life and language for as long as we have spoken English.

In fact, before we spoke English. In the 6th century AD, Pope Gregory I’s reaction to seeing fair-haired English boys for the first time was ‘Non Angli, sed Angeli’ — ‘they are not Angles, but Angels’ — proving that even Popes love a good pun. In Latin.

And any student of English literature quickly realises that even our greatest writers have had a weakness for double-meanings.

Chaucer loved them. Shakespeare could never resist them.

It’s always satisfying to hear the audience groan in a Midsummer Night’s Dream when Bottom, magically given the head of a donkey, responds by saying ‘this is to make an ass of me’.

You’d think, with such a literary heritage, that puns would be a highly regarded art, but quite the opposite is true. Puns are more often than not seen as an embarrassment.

I remember a lecturer at Cambridge talking about Shakespeare’s ‘fatal weakness for puns’, as if it were a major flaw in the Bard’s credentials. Indeed, in the world of comedy, puns are seen as the lowest form of wit.

Oddly John Cleese allowed some truly egregious puns into Fawlty Towers

‘A pun,’ said John Cleese, of Monty Python and Fawlty Towers fame, ‘is a substitute for a joke.’

Cleese would get famously angry at the pun-laden scripts of the Sixties BBC radio hit I’m Sorry I’ll Read That Again.

Oddly, though, he allowed some truly egregious puns into Fawlty Towers.

One hotel guest, discovering that the salt cellar is full of sugar complains that he has just sprinkled it ‘all over the plaice’.

‘All over the place?’ explodes Cleese as Basil Fawlty. ‘What were you doing with it?’ Even those who hate puns sometimes just can’t resist ’em.

Radio comedy in the Forties and Fifties revolved around puns, because radio comedy has to be about words rather than physical comedy. 

The biggest post-war wireless hit, Take It From Here — which launched its writers, Frank Muir and Denis Norden, towards decades of TV stardom — contained some famous ones, including the line ‘Infamy! Infamy! They’ve all got it in for me!’ which was later pinched for Carry On Cleo, and delivered by Kenneth Williams. 

It was an age of much greater censorship, and the BBC were particularly stringent.

In 1948, the BBC’s Guide For Writers And Producers, known as The Green Book, placed an ‘absolute ban’ on ‘suggestive references to: honeymoon couples, chambermaids, fig leaves, prostitution, ladies’ underwear and lodgers’. 

Puns were used to smuggle rudeness into scripts, both in broadcasting and on stage.

Everybody from Max Miller to Kenneth Horne used puns to get round the censors.

Many of Miller’s are still too rude for polite company and would be banned before the 9pm watershed.

Spike Milligan, meanwhile, wrote a character called Hugh Jampton into the Goon Show.

Supposedly, he and Peter Sellers waited for the BBC to cut the line, but the bosses didn’t get the joke, and it stayed in. (The rhyming slang Hampton Wick was a reliable staple of British comedy.)

Then there were the Julian and Sandy sketches of the mid-Sixties. These characters were two highly camp and clearly gay unemployed actors who were forever trying out different jobs.

The writers, Barry Took and Marty Feldman, gave them puns of exquisite cleverness that constantly tested the boundaries. 

As lawyers, they claimed ‘we’ve got a criminal practice that takes up most of our time’ — a line delivered in the very year, 1967 — that homosexuality was decriminalised, and a rare example of a pun being used to make a satirical point.

Later generations, not subject to the same restrictions of subject-matter, didn’t understand the subversive role of the pun, and came to regard puns as just old-fashioned and feeble. 

The punning songs of the Two Ronnies were mercilessly satirised by alternative sketch show Not The Nine O’Clock News, and critics regularly used ‘pun-laden’ as a term of abuse.

Puns were seen as childish. Indeed, they are usually the basis of the first jokes children learn.

Today, the BBC’s guidelines for sitcom writers expressly warn against puns. Which makes it all the more heartening for lovers of the English language, with all its glorious potential for verbal mischief, that in 2013 puns are alive and well and thriving in the stand-up routines of comics like Rob Auton and Tim Vine.

But if you think puns are cheap or easy laughs, you’d be wrong.

Think of the story of the headline writer on a Scottish newspaper confronted by the news that Inverness Caledonian Thistle had comprehensively beaten a poor Celtic side.

This was an unexpected result, and Caley Thistle were delighted.

The editor thought about it for a bit, and then wrote the headline Super Caley Go Ballistic, Celtic Are Atrocious. That’s not an easy laugh. That’s genius.
