She already has a best-selling clothing line with John Lewis, so it comes as no surprise that Alice Temperley is expanding her range with the department store.

After much anticipation, the much-lauded British designer has finally unveiled her Somerset John Lewis lingerie and nightwear collection.

The range is the most recent extension of the brand launched by Alice - whose fans include the Middleton and Geldof sisters - for John Lewis.

Fusing vintage and Oriental influences, the 23-piece collection is inspired by Japanese prints and Yves Saint Laurent's iconic ‘Le Smoking’ tuxedo suit.

The hero piece of the collection is a show-stopping black sleeveless silk jumpsuit with ivory piping on the tuxedo-style lapels (£145).

Knickerbocker glory: Leaf designed Cami knicker set (£55)

Somerset lingerie comprises four balconette bra and classic knicker sets, available in a silk scallop style in claret and ivory, a cream vintage lace, and a Japanese-inspired ‘Night Floral’ print designed by Alice, trimmed with black Austrian eyelash lace.

The collection also includes short and long chemises in vintage-inspired lace, from £75, and a short chemise in the exclusive ‘Night Floral’ print, which costs £85.

Her favourite: Alice loves the masculine tuxedo jumpsuit (£145)

Fusion of styles: The range fuses vintage and oriental influences, Tuxedo pyjama set (£150)

The nightwear has been designed to double up as luxe loungewear, and there's masculine tailored silk pyjama tops and palazzo pant sets in berry and black, which cost £150.

There are also vintage French boudoir-style camisoles with matching shorts, and an Oriental-inspired belted kimono robe.

Jo Hooper, Head of Womenswear at John Lewis, said: 'The début lingerie and nightwear collection marks a new chapter in the evolution of the Somerset brand. The collection epitomises Alice’s vintage, eclectic style, combined with her knowledge of what makes women feel special.'

Camis: There is also vintage French boudoir-style camisoles with matching shorts (£65)

Racy lacy: Somerset lingerie comprises four balconette bra and classic knicker sets, available in a silk scallop style in claret and ivory (bra, £45, briefs, £25)

Alice Temperley added: 'Lingerie is my next love after clothing; I think it is what is worn underneath that really inspires a woman to feel beautiful in her clothes – that inner, secret glamour.

'We know that the Somerset woman values beautiful fabric and detail, so I was really happy with the print and lace we have brought into the designs, all in a luxurious silk for an amazing price.

'It was also fun to play with the sleepwear; the tux is especially nostalgic of the black and white Ginger Rogers movies of my childhood.'

Royal seal of approval: The Duchess of Cambridge wore Alice Temperley for the War Horse premiere last year

Fans in high places: Peaches Geldof, Rosario Dawson and Pippa Middleton sat front row at the Temperley show in 2011

Somerset lingerie arrives in stores nationwide and online on 1st October. Lingerie sizes range from 30-36B-C/30-34D/32-34DD and nightwear pieces are available in S-L, with prices starting from £15 for a ‘Night Floral’ print silk eye mask, to £250 for a cashmere night robe.

Stars such as Rihanna, Keira Knightley, Beyonce and Cameron Diaz have been spotted in gowns from British designer Jenny Packham.

But the most memorable piece was worn by the Duchess of Cambridge - a £3,800 shimmering gown worn to the ARK charity gala in 2011.

And now, the Duchesses' favourite designer has launched a purse-friendly beauty range for Boots in time for Christmas.

Salonniere Soap Selection, £8

Boots have co-created the Salonnière range with the fashion designer.  Priced at £8 for the soap collection and £20 for the bathing range, the line is much more affordable than her A-list dresses and each bottle has been inspired by the intricate lace designs that made her a Royal favourite.

Salonniere Elegant Hands, £14

Salonniere Glamorous Lips, £14
