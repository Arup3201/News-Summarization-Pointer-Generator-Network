Great Dixter made Christopher Lloyd a horticultural household name. But, as a new TV series and book reveal, it owes much to a formidable woman - his mother, Daisy.

The most provocative and influential garden of recent times, Great Dixter has anticipated many of the gardening trends of the past 50 years - wildflower meadows, tropical-style gardens and successional planting, where flowers appear in a continuous wave from spring until autumn.

Associated today with Christopher Lloyd, the enfant terrible of British horticulture, the garden was originally created by his parents, with the help of the great Edwardian architect Edwin Lutyens.

Nathaniel and Daisy Lloyd bought Great Dixter in 1910 and Christo, as he was always known, was born there in 1921.

When Nathaniel died in 1933, Daisy took control of the garden and for the next four decades presided over it with an iron trowel.

Although Christo would later be credited with popularising the meadow style, it was Daisy who first introduced it to Dixter, transforming the rough grass in front  of the house into a tapestry of wild flowers. Dixter's famous Long Border was also Daisy's creation.

Daisy was known to her family as 'the management' and she cultivated her six children with the same obsessive zeal as she cultivated her six-acre garden.

She taught them the Latin names of plants and tested them ruthlessly on plant identification, sending the five boys weekly bundles of fresh flowers when they were at boarding school. Christo was the most biddable of her children, and also painfully shy. Even as a grown man he was happy to spend almost all his time with his mother.

After a spell as a lecturer in horticulture, Christo returned to Dixter, and to Daisy, in 1954. Now with only three gardeners - originally there had been nine - he and Daisy opened a plant nursery to supplement their income.

Daisy died in 1972, aged 91; deprived of his main companion, Christo blossomed socially and Dixter became famous for its jolly weekend parties, full of enthusiastic horticulturists.

Relieved of the constraints of fashion and taste after his mother's death, Christo could experiment in the garden at will. His most famous and  controversial alteration after Daisy's death was to dig up the 80-year-old Rose Garden and transform it into an Exotic Garden.

Here, lush foliage like hardy bananas and the huge elephant's ear, Colocasia esculenta, were mixed with brightly coloured late-summer plants including dahlias, cannas, salvias and begonias. This caused outrage and, like a naughty child, he delighted in the furore, describing the sound of the rose roots being ripped from the earth as 'music to my ears'.

Predictably, despite the controversy, Christo's Exotic Garden began a trend for exotic planting that continues to this day.

Shortly before his death in 2006, Christo set up a charitable trust that has ensured Great Dixter is still open to the public. The garden continues to evolve, but the spirit of Daisy and Christo lives on there. It is still a place full of surprises.
