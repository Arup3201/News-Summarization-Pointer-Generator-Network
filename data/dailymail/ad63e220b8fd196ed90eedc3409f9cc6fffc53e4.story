A lorry shed its load of thousands of tins of baked beans across a busy stretch of motorway leaving motorists facing lengthy delays.

Drivers in Merseyside were being urged to keep clear of the M6 at Haydock this evening with one lane of the motorway in both directions remaining closed.

The crash happened between junctions 22 and 23 as the lorry hit the central reservation.

Clean up: Workers look at the load of Heinz tins that were left scattered across the M6 today when a lorry crashed into the central reservation near Haydock, Merseyside

Ongoing operation: Highways Agency workers from all over the area joined forces to help shift the lorry's load from the carriageway

Messy: Cans were strewn all over the carriageway, left, and were reloaded onto other trucks following the crash

The motorway was closed for a while but reopened once the lorry was moved.

One lane in either direction is still closed while the remainder of the lorry's load of Heinz Baked Beans and soup is removed and a temporary barrier installed between the two carriageways.

The 58-year-old driver of the lorry is said to have suffered minor injuries and was given first aid by firefighters.

Two other vehicles were also damaged in the crash but no one else was hurt.

A spokesman for the Highways Agency said: 'After a brief closure of the motorway to right the vehicle, two lanes of the carriageway in each direction have been running this afternoon.

Traffic chaos: The crash caused severe tailbacks in the Haydock area of Merseyside

Steer clear: The Highways Agency was still warning motorists to keep clear of the area this evening with the clear-up operation continuing

'But both outside lanes will remain closed for the lorry to be removed, the shed load to be recovered and for temporary barrier repairs to be carried out.

'It is likely that permanent barrier repairs will need to be carried out overnight tonight.

'This will involve further lane closures but at a time when traffic is at its lightest and with little impact on motorway usersâ€™ journeys.

'Highways Agency traffic officers from the out-station at Newton-le-Willows have been at the scene helping to manage traffic.

'Colleagues at the North West Regional Control Centre at Newton-le-Willows and the National Traffic Operations Centre at Birmingham have set signs across the local, regional and national motorway network to advise drivers of the incident.'
