The scientist who inspired Jodie Foster's character in the film Contact is retiring after 35 years of studying the universe for signs that we are not alone.

Astronomer Jill Tarter, 68, announced today that she will stand down as head of the non-profit Center for Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI).

Dr Tarter was the inspiration for  Carl Sagan’s novel Contact which led to the 1997 film starring Jodie Foster and Matthew McConaughey. Foster played Dr Eleanor Arroway, a SETI scientist chosen to make contact after she finds evidence of extraterrestrial life.

Dr Tarter plans to spend her time fundraising for the center in Mountain View, California.

She said: 'I want to make the endowment of SETI research a success, so that my colleagues now, and in the future, can focus on the search for extraterrestrial intelligence for all of us.'

Dr Tarter earned a Bachelor of Engineering Physics Degree at Cornell University, going on to complete a Master's degree and PhD in astronomy at the University of California, Berkeley.

She started working with the program in the 1970s when a group of NASA researchers began developing radio equipment to look for other forms of life in the universe. 

SETI was founded in November 1984 and today employs around 150 scientists.

The scientist was at the helm of a ten-year project that used large antennas in Australia, Puerto Rico and West Virginia to examine 1,000 star systems over an unprecedented wide range of radio frequencies.

Life on screen: Jodie Foster played Dr Ellie Arroway, based on Jill Tarter, in the 1997 film Contact about the search for alien life forms

When NASA launched their Kepler telescope in 2009, thousands of new planetary systems were discovered.

Dr Tarter said: 'The best reason to support SETI research is because it is an investment in our own future. 

'If we detect a signal, we could learn about THEIR past (because of the time their signal took to reach us) and the possibility of OUR future. 

'Understanding that it is possible to find solutions to our terrestrial problems and to become a very old civilization, because someone else has managed to do just that, is hugely important! 

'Knowing that there can be a future may motivate us to achieve it.'

Dr Tarter has been lauded throughout her career.

She has received two public service medals from NASA and became a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2002.

She was named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by Time Magazine in 2004.

During the filming of Contact, Jodie Foster met with Dr Tarter as part of her character research.

The astronomer served as a consultant on the production to help capture the struggles of women scientists in the 1970s.
