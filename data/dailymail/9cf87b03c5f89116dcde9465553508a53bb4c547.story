Winter weather isn't waiting for the calendar to say when it's time to hit the northern U.S. this year, with snowfall predicted across as many as seven states by Tuesday.

Montana, Wyoming, the Dakotas, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan should all see some snow in the coming week, if the new GFS model is correct, as expected temperatures dip into the 30s.

For the lucky in Wyoming, that snow will only fall on the mountains.

'I suspect any 'lake effect' in Michigan will be ice pellets embedded in rain showers coming off the lakes, which are probably still too warm for snow,' wrote Roy W. Spencer on his personal site.

'Michigan lake effect snow usually holds off till October, at the earliest,' he added.

According to Accuweather, the coldest air since last spring will move south from Canada and across the northern and central plains, Midwest and the east slopes of the Rockies.

The air will be followed by rain in some areas, before frost arrives on Friday.

Temperatures are forecast to dip into the 30s in rural areas of the Dakotas, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Nebraska, according to the weather website's senior meteorologist, Alex Sosnowski.
