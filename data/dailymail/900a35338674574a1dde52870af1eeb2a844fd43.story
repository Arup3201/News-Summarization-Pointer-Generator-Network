Tottenham are monitoring £2million-rated Nigerian winger Moses Simon.

They watched the 19-year-old in both legs of Trencin’s Europa League qualifier against Hull and are weighing up a bid for the teenager.

Meanwhile, Atletico Madrid have relaunched a bid to sign Roberto Soldado from Tottenham but want an initial loan.

The move is likely to be met with a swift rebuttal by Tottenham who would be reluctant to allow the Spain international to leave just a year on from signing him for £26million from Valencia.

Tottenham have interest from QPR in winger Andros Townsend but will not sell the England international for less than £10million.
