Guilty: Laura Johnson is facing a lengthy jail term after being convicted of burglary and handling stolen goods

A Metropolitan Police detective is under investigation for allegedly sending an 'inappropriate text' to the daughter of a millionaire midway through her trial for looting during the London riots.

Detective Constable James Quigley is said to have sent former grammar school prefect Laura Johnson the message when he completed his evidence for the prosecution.

She was yesterday facing a lengthy jail term after being convicted of acting as a chauffeur for a drug-dealing gangster and his friends as they pillaged electrical goods during a seven-hour crime spree.

The matter was raised in the absence of the jury after Johnson, who was due to give evidence, reported it to her barrister Martin McCarthy.

The communication is not believed to contain anything sexual.

But the officer could be held in contempt of court over the allegations he contacted the 20-year-old, a fellow witness in a trial.

Detective Constable Quigley, an expert on gangs in South London, became involved in the case when the Johnson family complained to police about alleged media intrusion.

He visited them at their home in Orpington, Kent, after the Johnsons reported fearing for their safety.

This was after pictures of their home were broadcast in the news and they were concerned this could tip-off south London gangs about where they lived.

The matter of the inappropriate text has been passed to the Met's internal disciplinary body the Directorate of Professional Standards.

A Met Police spokesman said: 'We can confirm a 38-year-old male officer, from Bromley, has been placed on restricted duties, pending the outcome of an internal investigation, following allegations of inappropriate behaviour.'

Johnson was found guilty of burglary and handling stolen goods after the two-week trial at Inner London Crown Court.

The maximum sentence for handling is 14 years. She was acquitted of stealing cigarettes from a BP garage.

Jurors heard how Johnson became friends with convicted crack dealer and thief Emmanuel Okubote after being introduced to him through a mutual friend.

On the evening of 8 August, as riots erupted across the capital, she drove to Okubote's house initially to drop off a phone charger.

But she ended up chauffeuring him, 18-year-old Alexander Elliott-Joahill and an unnamed 17-year-old on a looting spree.

With Johnson at the steering wheel, the gang of thieves jumped out and either looted stores or robbed passers-by at knifepoint.

The 17-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was also convicted of burglary.

Trial judge Patricia Lees warned the pair that they faced a custodial sentence, adding: 'You have both been convicted of serious offences.'

During her testimony, Johnson claimed that she had felt powerless to stop the gang, who she said had jumped into her car wearing hooded tops and balaclavas before ordering her to drive. She will be sentenced on 3 May.
