A terrifying video has surfaced showing teenagers riding on the outside of a train as it crosses the Williamsburg bridge that links Brooklyn with Manhattan.

A growing numbers of teenagers in search of Internet fame are risking their lives by performing dangerous stunts on the New York City subway in what is becoming an alarming online trend.

YouTube is filled with clips of young men in their teens and early 20s jumping across the tracks, playing chicken with trains and 'surfing' on moving trains.

The growing number of recordings and images posted online showing the underground acts of daring has left New York City officials calling for a crackdown on thrill-seekers.

Scroll down for video...

I believe I can fly: The foolish teenager lifts both his feet off the floor as the J train hurtles across the Williamsburg Bridge

Crazy: Subway surfing is the most x-treme NYC sport, the ultimate x-pression of rebellion in a world run amok

Hold on: The surfer clings on as the train hurtles through the subway tunnels

Difference: The subway surfers are given a unique perspective into the subway system from the outside of the trains

Train traffic ahead: In the video it looks as though this train was on-coming, but the film was played in reverse. Still, it is too close for comfort for the majority

The teenagers subway surf on a J train over the Williamsburg Bridge.

In this latest video, the participants believe they are taking part in some kind of extreme sport - the ultimate expression of rebellion.

No thought is given to the fact that their actions not only cause massive delays for fellow strap-hangers but the risk of serious injury or death does not even occur.

Why don't you take the J train? The J train crosses the Williamsburg bridge on the top level of the bridge from where there are spectacular views - but you don't need to be on the outside of the train to enjoy them!

Mind the gap: The ledge on which the subway surfer stand isn't even wide enough to hold their foot

Precarious perch: Just one false move, and it's all over. Surely?

Walloped: There were 53 subway-related deaths last year - but 151 people were hit by trains

Down time: The subway surfing took place in the middle of the night when there were very few passengers on board the Williamsburg bridge was eerily quiet

Risk: Subway surfing causes massive delays for fellow strap-hangers and of course risk serious injury or death

The video was filmed with the riders hanging on at the rear of the train and then played in reverse once it was posted online. It gives the appearance that the riders are at the front of the train as it hurtles through the subway system.

At one point, the surfer lifts both of his legs in the air and clings on to the rear of the train and it crosses the bridge.

A few minutes later the young mans feet are seen on the precariously thin ledge at the very rear of the subway car holding on with just one hand.

Easy rider: The young man shown in this viral YouTube video 'surfing' a New York City subway is only one of a large community of thrill-seekers who perform risky stunts underground

Leap of faith: One of the most popular feats among teenage daredevils is jumping across the subway tracks

Enough is enough: The MTA has called for a crackdown on people bent on putting their lives at risk and threatening the safety of others

The Metropolitan Transportation Agency that oversees the sprawling New York City subway system has called the stunts 'exceedingly stupid' and 'extremely dangerous,' urging the public: 'Donâ€™t do it.'

There were 53 subway-related deaths in New York City last year.

Even those instances of risky subway feats that do not end in tragedy are stomach-churning to watch.

In a video that went viral when it hit YouTube in October 2011, a grinning young man in a baseball cap worn backwards could be seen 'surfing' on a moving train by holding onto a door from the outside of the car.
