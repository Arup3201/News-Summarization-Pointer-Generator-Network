For commuters it is perhaps the most baffling annual excuse for delays and cancellations on the railways: Leaves on the line.

But there may now be a solution to the problem and it involves zapping autumn litter into oblivion with lasers.

Dutch rail company Nederlandse Spoorwegen has revealed it is working with the Delft University of Technology and a British inventor to fit powerful lasers under two of its trains to burn away leaves from the tracks.

Falling leaves from trees beside railway tracks led to  4.5 million hours of passenger delays last year, so rail operators hope a new laser system will help them clear the dangerous leafy mulch that builds up on rails

The technology will use intense beams of infrared light to vaporise the build up of material on the rails before the wheels of the train passes over them.

Fallen leaves cause delays on the rail network because they can cover and stick to the tracks when wet.

This can make the tracks slippery in itself, but the problem becomes worse when heavy metal train wheels pass over the top, as the leaves get sucked under the wheels and crushed, compacting the material into a hard, shiny substance that has been compared to Teflon.

When this layer becomes wet, the tracks become excessively slippery and braking distances can double. Once stationary, trains can also struggle to get going again as they are unable to get traction on the tracks.

Leaf mulch can also insulate train wheels from the rails, meaning signallers get less information about the location of trains on the network, meaning trains need to run with bigger spaces between them.

Yet despite this, leaves on the line remains the excuse most likely to infuriate train travellers each autumn as they struggle to understand why rail companies cannot be better prepared for this problem.

The perennial excuse of fallen leaves  causing travel chaos has long been seen as a running joke, but according to Network Rail in the UK, leaves caused 4.5 million hours of passenger delays in 2013.

The laser device sits just in front of the wheels while a specially designed suspension system helps to keep the high powered beam focused on the layer of mulch that builds up on rails as leaves get wet and break down

Methods including brushing and grinding the rails, washing with jets of water or ice have all been tried, but with limited success.

Now researchers at Delft University of Technology have been developing a system with the Dutch rail engineering firm Strukton Rail, the national network ProRail and train operator Nederlandse Spoorwegen.

‘We are now investigating whether offers laser solution,’ Jurjen Hendriks, one of the researchers at Delft University of Technology told the website Kennislink.

The Laser Railhead Cleaner (LRC) which has been installed by the researchers on a Nederlandse Spoorwegen DM-90 train, sits under the train just in front of the wheels.

Most current methods for removing mulch from train tracks use high powered jets of water to wash the rails

The device uses a Nd:YAG laser to pulses of laser light with a wavelength of around 1,064 nanometres, which is infrared.

According to experts the wavelength used is specifically absorbed by the leaves and other organic matter that can build up on the tracks, but not by metal.

This means that the energy from the lasers is reflected off the rails without damaging them while the leaf material is vaporised, a process known as ablation.

A spokesman for Strukton Rail said: ‘The LRC briefly heats the organic material on the rails and because the organic material expands more rapidly it separates from the rails.

Lasers can be used to detect when fruits like apples, bananas, pears and tomatoes reach their 'peak' for eating.

Researchers from Saint Joseph University in Lebanon and the Université de Bretagne Occidentale de Brest in France have developed a technique that looks at the speckling of the skin of fruits.

As climacteric fruits like apples and bananas mature and ripen on the tree, it is important to pick them at exactly the right moment.

After this point the fruit becomes vulnerable to fungi or starts to rot.

The researchers found they could analyse the speckle patterns on the skin of Golden apples as they ripened by looking at the way the laser light was scattered and reflected from apple skin.

This changed as the fruit ripened. The researchers hope the technique can be used to help farmers pick their fruit at exactly the right time.

‘What’s more, rust bursts away as well. The rails are cleaned and dried as a result, preventing any other material from adhering to them for some time.

‘Tests have shown that because they are solid, rails and other infrastructural objects are not damaged by the ablation process.’

The Laser Railhead Cleaner technology was first invented by a former Royal Navy Officer called Malcolm Higgins, who has developed the technology under the company name LaserThor.

Tests on his technology between 1999 and 2004 were conducted by RailTrack and its predecessor Network Rail but revealed that it struggled to focus the laser correctly on the track due to vibrations as the trains picked up speed.

However, Mr Higgins proved that dirt and moisture were vaporised from the track at speeds just over 6mph.

He later teamed up with the German Fraunhofer institute in Aachen and the Rofin Sinar laser firm in Hamburg to develop a more powerful laser.

This used a two kilowatts of infrared laser light that produced 25,000 pulses per second. This heated the leafy mulch to temperatures of more than 5,000 degrees, causing it to vanish from the rails.

Further tests with Network Rail showed it was successful at speaks of up to 40mph, but Network Rail said it chose not to take the tests further.

Mr Higgins has now been working with Strukton Rail and Delft University as a consultant on the project.

They have been able to improve the system so that it can clean 20mm of rail head on both sides of the track at speeds of up to 50mph.

Their device also uses a suspension system to help protect the optics of the laser from vibrations while the laser also temporarily switches off if it misses its target.

Instead of lasers, Network rail said it is now concentrating on using high pressure jet washing technology to bash away leaf mulch and laying down a composite of sand and aluminium onto the tracks to aid traction.

The laser is focused onto the rail head so that pulses of intense light vaporise any organic material that has built up on the surface of the tracks

This year Network Rail has also begun using new technology called a tribometer, a handheld device that accurately measures how slippery the rails are, on its network in Merseyside.

Data from this device is then used to assess the effectiveness of treatments and whether more are needed, according to the company.

But lasers also have advantages as sand and water tanks need to be regularly refilled while water jets can damage the rails.

They claim their laser is so precise it can etch a diagram into the head of a match without setting it alight. 

Professor Rolf Dollevoet, who is leading the new trials at Delft University of Technology, said: ‘The question is not so much whether the laser system works, but for how long the rails will remain clean.

‘We’ll measure the remaining friction over time during rain, drizzle, frost and snowfall.

‘From these measurements NS and Prorail can derive at what frequency the 6,000km  of track need to be lasered and how many trains have to be equipped with lasers to achieve that.’
