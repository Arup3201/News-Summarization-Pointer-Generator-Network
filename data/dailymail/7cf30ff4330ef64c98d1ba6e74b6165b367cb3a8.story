Opening the curtains in the bedroom last week, I let out a loud groan. Gone was my manicured grass, an acre of which had stretched down to the woods beyond our house in Somerset.

In its place? A sea of churned-up turf. The ornamental vases and topiary which had highlighted the lawn’s lush green were surrounded by huge heaps of earth.

While horrified by the sight that confronted me, I was far from baffled. For I knew exactly who the culprit was — our midnight gardener, Brock the badger, named after the Beatrix Potter character, digging in search of worms.

With the soil now softening up after a rain-drenched first half to October, the worms have become more easily obtainable, attracting badgers to our gardens

For the past three autumns he and his family (I confess I struggle to tell their little black-and-white faces apart) have made their home in the woods near our house — and also made our lives a misery.

In summer and winter they leave us alone and undisturbed, but every autumn they come scurrying across and tear up our lawn.

And this year it’s not just my area of England that is being ravaged by these hungry lawn-destroyers. The unusually warm September meant that badgers were unable to dig through the dry soil to reach those juicy worms on which they feast.

With the soil now softening up after a rain-drenched first half to October, the worms have become more easily obtainable. That, coupled with an abundance of autumnal insect larvae, means it’s ‘grub up’ time — and lawns such as mine are the dinner table.

With a UK population of well over 800,000 badgers, this seasonal onslaught will be happening nationwide. 

And whereas boasting of a ‘badger problem’ used to be a badge of honour among the middle classes — a sign you had a large garden in the country — now they are digging up gardens of all shapes and sizes.

As urban areas continue to expand and sprawling housing developments encroach on badger territories, which can run to several acres, more people are finding themselves reluctant members of the badger set.

This is no comfort to keen gardeners who take pride in a well-tended sward, though. To them, the badger is a pest.

As for me, despite his night-time mauraudings, I confess I am strangely fond of our badger — or meles meles to give him his scientific name. My wife Maxeen has never quite forgiven me for once missing our wedding anniversary evening because I was so entranced watching a badger sett in the garden.

My fondness for the creatures goes back to my schooldays in Bournemouth in the late Sixties, when I discovered a badger sett only a ten-minute cycle ride from where we lived. Many an evening I’d shoot off down the lane to where the sett was — at the bottom of a bungalow’s garden, on a bank, half-hidden in a thicket of holly.

It was there that I met my first badger. It suddenly filled the sett’s darkening entrance with a blur of black and white, standing motionless, listening. Then he quietly slipped out and sniffed the air, paw raised.

A smaller, slimmer badger appeared behind him. A sow. His mate. They touched noses and purred. Then the sow rolled over and, with both front paws, gave her belly a hearty scratch, lips curled back in a blissful grin.

It was strangely human and utterly enchanting to watch. So much like ourselves, waking, stretching and scratching as we embrace a new day — or night, in the badgers’ case. They are noctural creatures, after all.

The UK has a population of well over 800,000 badgers

Many decades later, I try to remind myself of those fond memories as I set to work each morning with a trowel, on my knees, shuffling back and forth across my dewy lawn, rolling back each uprooted sod and uttering that same word out loud (with a rather different meaning) to vent my displeasure at the culprit.

Many of the holes I fill are round or elliptical. These are snuffle-holes, where the badger had pushed his snout down into the ground so he could suck up a juicy worm without breaking it in two.

Worms make up half of a badger’s diet. He will seek out insect larvae as well — cockchafers and leatherjackets in particular — in the roots of the grass, which is deftly pulled up and rolled back using his razor-sharp claws.

He is also partial to slugs and snails, and will take on small mammals such as rats, mice, rabbits and hedgehogs if available. But worms are his staple.

With each sod thumped back into place I remember a similar thud when I was 18 — the noise of my head hitting the bank after I fell out of a tree during another night-time badger-watching expedition.

That thud left me with a broken neck, which healed only after I had lain immobilised on my back for six weeks, not permitted to move. I still get the occasional twinge.

So it was with mingled pleasure and annoyance that I greeted Brock into my garden three years ago — and every year since. Nostalgia quickly turned to annoyance as he settled in, clearly identifying my lawn as a great snacking spot.

Night after night I leapt out of bed earlier and earlier, dragging back the curtains to be confronted by yet another ravaging of the lawn.

‘Well, do something to deter him,’ growled my wife, retreating under the duvet while I stomped out to don my wellingtons as the sun rose. 

A Google search produced some possibilities — but with a warning. Badgers are protected under the Protection of Badgers Act 1992 and neither the animal or its sett can be interfered with except in special circumstances requiring a licence.

In the case of gardens, this has to be issued by the Government’s agricultural department, which in England is Defra. I toyed with several options but in the end it was something of my own doing that proved to be most successful. It was entirely legal and Brock found it very off-putting.

Knowing how badgers have a highly developed sense of smell and mark their territory with urine and badger musk, I reasoned that if I marked mine in similar fashion, such a strong human scent should put him off.

There is no chemical that can legally be used as a badger deterrent. Using one means you are at risk of committing an offence under pesticide regulations or wildlife protection laws

So one evening I peed into a used disinfectant sprayer and sneaked out last thing to scurry round the lawn, pumping the sprayer furiously — pssss, pssss.

Opening the curtains the next morning, I found that the lawn was untouched.

I smiled when I thought of Brock tutting at my antisocial night-time activities for once.

Will I be able to keep up my anti-badger campaign? I’m not sure how much longer I’ll be able to keep it secret, but I guess at least there is a continual, ready supply of the repellent.

And this, my fellow gardeners, is my gift to you. Happy spraying.

From chopped chillies to strobe lighting, the ways to fight back

CHEMICAL WARFARE

There is no chemical that can legally be used as a badger deterrent. Using one means you are at risk of committing an offence under pesticide regulations or wildlife protection laws.

Some years back I discovered a rusty old tin of a badger deterrent called Renardine — now banned — left by the previous owners of our house. At the time we’d had a few badger incursions, so I gave it a go. It meant painting a vile-smelling liquid on string strung across the lawn.

It drove the badgers away but almost drove us out, too. The smell pervaded every corner of our property and neighbours phoned to ask if we had a leaking septic tank.

Soaking strips of cloth in Citronella or Olbas Oil and draping them across the lawn may make Brock take one sniff and move on, but it needs to be done at dusk and repeated daily.

CHILLIES

Sprinkling finely chopped red chilli peppers around can be effective if your lawn isn’t too large.

I tried it, stripping a supermarket of its stock and raising the eyebrows of the cashier at the checkout. ‘For the badgers,’ I said. I was given a sad look. My look was even sadder later when, having strewn mashed peppers across the lawn, I stood back and, without thinking, rubbed my left eye.

ELECTRONIC GADGETS

A variety of ultrasonic alarms are available online and in some DIY stores which emit a high-pitched sound, not heard by humans, when they are triggered by the movement of an animal.

One, called Pest Reach, from Coopers of Stortford, also incorporates built-in strobe LED lights, so for less than £30 you can have your garden lit up and unheard alarm bells ring as soon as Brock puts a pad on to your lawn. 

These devices do seem to deter cats and may be effective against badgers, especially to start with. However, Brock is likely to get used to them, or put up with them if he’s hungry enough.

CHANGE THINGS AROUND

Badgers are very cautious, so they can be deterred by unusual objects or changes. A security light coming on can be effective. A scarecrow in a rustling mac could also work but might need repositioning daily. 

Reflective strips of plastic, wind chimes and toy windmills could make Brock think twice, too. There is a theory that the vibrations from windmills drive grubs deeper into the lawn, making them less accessible — but I think Brock will just dig deeper to get to them.

INTRODUCE OBSTACLES

Being creatures of habit, badgers like sticking to their traditional pathways. Weld mesh — steel wire grids available from builders’ merchants — can be tried to plug holes in fences, with more of it laid flat to stop Brock digging under them. 

One friend used a large boulder that he and his mate heaved with great difficulty across a badger run. The next day he found it rolled aside. Badgers are strong.

Electric fencing could protect a defined area, but may require a licence and can be costly.
