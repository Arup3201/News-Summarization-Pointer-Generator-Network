Former Rangers star Rino Gattuso put his life on the line against accusations of match fixing by declaring that he would kill himself in the street if found guilty.

Italian prosecutors named the World Cup-winning midfielder as part of a wide-ranging investigation on Tuesday, providing evidence that the ex-AC Milan star had been contacted by a go-between working on behalf of a match-rigging gang.

But the combative Gattuso came out fighting, declaring: ‘I am prepared to go into the town square and kill myself in front of everyone if I should be found guilty of such a crime.

Winner: Gattuso made 73 appearances for Italy and won the German World Cup in 2006

‘After all, my life would be meaningless from that point on. I would not have the courage to look 
anyone in the eye. I say that from the heart.

‘In my life, I have never sat down with anyone to fix games, nor have I ever thought to, as I wouldn’t even know where to start.

‘I
 don’t even play five-a-side football with my friends because I can’t 
stand losing. This matter is absurd and unbelievable. I don’t know what 
they want from me. I don’t know what match-fixing is.

‘I am angry and offended. I do not want to have this stain on my career and my character.’

Battle-hardened: Walter Smith signed a 19-year-old Gattuso for Scottish club Rangers in 1997

The
 two-time Champions League winner, who held talks with Rangers boss Ally
 McCoist and then-chief executive Charles Green about a spectacular 
return to Ibrox in the summer of 2012, was named in a prosecutor’s 
report released to the Italian media yesterday.

His
 home was raided as part of a widespread swoop by Operation Last Bet, 
including the arrest of four men — among them Francesco Bazzani. The 
report issued yesterday shows 13 texts from Bazzani to Gattuso, as well 
as a number to former Lazio player Cristian Brocchi.

Prosecutor
 Roberto di Martino said: ‘Gattuso and Brocchi were connected to the 
case by the use of phone taps. We’ve made four arrests and 16 searches. 
Some of these searches have produced a positive outcome. We found notes 
and notebooks whose contents were based on betting.’

Familiar face: Gattuso made 51 appearances during his time with Rangers, scoring five goals

But
 Gattuso hit back, declaring: ‘The phone records show Bazzani sent me 13
 text messages. They will, therefore, also show I never replied to any 
of them.

This man knows half of Serie A, he came to the Milanello gates 
like many hundreds of others.

He was a  bookmaker in Bologna, but I 
never talked about fixing games.

‘Match-fixing
 is just not part of who I am. I made some bets when it was still 
allowed, but as soon as it was barred for professionals, I stopped. No 
problem.

‘I am accused not of placing bets, but of fixing games, and I can’t understand how they can do that.

‘I
 was in Naples, so only found out about the raid from my wife, after police took me in to sign some papers. I hope the 
magistrate calls me in soon because I want to clarify my position.

‘I
 had also been dragged into this affair two years ago. I am convinced 
and fully aware of my innocence. I spent my entire career working hard. I
 have a foundation that allowed me to give away £1.25million to help 
children and then people suggest I fixed games to earn more? It just 
doesn’t make sense.’

Gattuso’s
 home was raided on Tuesday on the strength of phone calls and text 
messages that, according to the report of the investigating judge, cast 
some suspicion on the Italian international.

Excerpts
 from the report make special mention of calls and  messages — the 
content of which remains unknown — between Gattuso and Bazzani, 
referred to as ‘Mr Y’ in an investigation that has so far seen 
widespread arrests in Italy, Singapore and South America.

The
 report, which focuses heavily on Milan’s title-winning season of 
2010-11, reads: ‘There were  contacts on the occasion of the match 
between Chievo and Milan on February 20, 2011.

‘These
 indicate a further element of particular importance, indicative of 
relations with the professional football world — contacts with the 
player of AC Milan, Gennaro Ivan Gattuso …

‘The
 analysis of telephone contacts of Bazzani, at the mentioned match, 
has revealed the singular coincidence of a contact (SMS outbound) with a
 user name to AC Millan footballer Gattuso.’

Heartbreak: Gattuso was part of the Rangers side that lost the Scottish Cup Final to Hearts in 1998

Cremona-based
 di Martino, who has worked alongside fellow prosecutors from Bari and 
Naples, said the latest arrests show that little has moved on since the ‘Calciopoli’ match-rigging scandal of 2006 which resulted in the demotion of champions Juventus to Serie B.

‘I’m not a commentator and I’m not here to pontificate,’ he said.

‘But
 we are faced with some clear facts that, despite the arrests and 
investigation, most of these people continue to do what they did before 
(Calciopoli).

‘There are 30 
matches in Serie A in which there are contacts between Bazzani and the 
players or managers who are linked to the team playing the next day or 
two days later.

‘There 
clearly hasn’t been much reaction to what happened before, because 
things are carrying on just as usual for these people.’
