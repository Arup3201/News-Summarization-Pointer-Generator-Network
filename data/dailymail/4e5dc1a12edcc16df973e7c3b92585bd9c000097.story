These odd-looking monkeys could be straight out of a cartoon with their bright white googly eyes.

Cutting an uncanny resemblance to the novelty features used in arts and crafts, their playful appearance attracts quite a crowd of tourists.

Native to Africa and Asia, dusky langur monkeys are affectionately branded 'spectacled leaf monkeys'.

Googly: These dusky langur monkeys in Kaeng Krachan National Park have eyes like stick-on googly eyes

Thanks to the striking similarity, they have merited the nickname 'spectacled leafy monkey' in Thailand

These charming images were taken in Kaeng Krachan National Park, Phetchaburi province, Thailand, by amateur photographer Michael Edward.

Mr Edward, 29, captured the cheeky dusky langur monkeys as they played together in the trees during a three-week wildlife photography tour across Thailand.

The Egypt-born IT administrator said: 'I spotted these monkeys while I was enjoying a three-week-long wildlife photography tour in Thailand.

'I stayed a couple of hours with this group of monkeys - I saw the first one and stayed with it for a while before it led me to the mother and young baby.

Their playful appearance make them look like muppets or cartoons, attracting swarms of tourists

Young dusky langurs are born a dazzingly bright orange but turn black or brown within weeks

Once they warmed to photographer Michael Edwards, 29, they swung around gleefully posing

'After a couple of minutes of me being around them, they started to trust me which is how I was able to capture such good photographs of them at such close range.'

Baby dusky langurs are born with bright orange fur which changes to the characteristic black coat once they reach around three months old.

Michael said: 'I love to photograph animals, they are my favourite things to take photos of.

Worryingly, the unusual-looking species are near-threatened, experts warn due to habitat loss

Their population has dropped by more than 30 per cent in 30 years and is set to decrease yet further

'I have always loved animals - when I was growing up in Egypt we lived in a big house with exotic animals, such as Siamese cats, dogs, snakes, turtles and birds.

'I prefer to take photos of animals in their natural habitats, living freely in the wild.

'I love nature and don't like to see animals locked up in cages. You can capture the best moments by watching animals running free in the wild.'

But these little ones in Phetchaburi province, Thailand, are happily roaming freely

This funny-looking species are currently classed as 'near threatened' after the number of these monkeys has dropped by more than 30 percent over the last 30 years.

The main threats include habitat loss caused by farming and human settlements - in Malaysia there are also a significant number of deaths on the roads.

Their diet consists mainly of leaves, as well as seeds, fruit and flowers.
