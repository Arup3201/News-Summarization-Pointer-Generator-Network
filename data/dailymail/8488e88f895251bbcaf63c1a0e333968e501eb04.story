A motorcyclist on a round-the-world trip took his trusty bike more than 16,000 miles through Asia and Europe, only to have it stolen in Swansea.

Martin Williams, 53, left his home in 
Australia six months ago to ride his motorcycle through some of the most
 dangerous and harsh environments on the planet.

His 16,156 mile journey through troubled spots in Asia and Europe went without a hitch - until he arrived in Wales.

Crime victim: Martin Williams, 53, rode his bike half way around the world, through South Korea, Russia and Scandinavia, only to have it stolen in Swansea

His visit to Welsh relatives ended in heartbreak when his 650cc Kawasaki machine, worth around £2,500, was stolen from their driveway.

'In all my travels I haven’t had any bad experiences until now - everyone has been brilliant and so hospitable,' said Mr Williams.

'I couldn’t believe my eyes. I found a cut chain and my luggage thrown on the ground with no sign of the bike.

High-spec: The motorcycle has been modified so it can tackle a range of terrain - including the Gobi desert

'I think it may have been pushed into the back of a van because there are marks. I am feeling really numb and am in shock. It hasn’t sunk in yet.'

Mr Williams set off from Newcastle, north of Sydney, last July to bike thousands of miles.

He rode his bike through South Korea, Russia, Mongolia, The Baltic States, Scandinavia, Germany, France and Spain before reaching Britain for Christmas.

Shock: When Mr Williams woke up ready to begin his ride down the length of Africa he discovered his bike, pictured outside St Petersburg, Russia, had been stolen off the drive

'I grew up in Swansea and spent 20 years here so was really excited about coming back to visit,' he said.

'It is very much my home town and I had a great family Christmas and New Year here.'

But when Mr Williams woke up yesterday morning ready to begin his ride down the length of Africa he discovered his bike had been stolen off the drive.

A 2009 survey revealed that the Welsh city was the most likely place in the UK for drivers to make a claim for a crash or stolen car, with the SA4 postcode area producing more insurance claims per head than any other.

Crime figures released last year showed there had been 1,684 reported thefts from cars and vans and 785 vehicle thefts across Swansea and Neath Port Talbot. Police have said that vehicle crime in the city has fallen over the last decade.

The machine is a white, blue and green coloured 650cc Kawasaki bike with an Australia number plate of NSW 37.

Mr Williams said: 'It is a proper travel bike built for tough roads. I had modified it in order to be able to travel round the world.

'I have had it for about seven to eight years and done a lot of travelling on it. I was supposed to be heading to Morocco and Africa today but now my plans are all up in the air.

'I was planning to travel for six months, return to Australia and then travel some more but now I have no idea what to do. It is awful news and now all I am hoping for is my bike to be returned to me.

'If whoever stole my bike sees this story I just want them to park it up and give me a call or send me an email.'

Anyone with information about the stolen bike can contact South Wales Police or speak to Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
