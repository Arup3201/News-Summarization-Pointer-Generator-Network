Meet The Undateables of the animal world - who have all found happiness thanks to one kind-hearted dog-lover.

These adorable pups were taken in by rescue worker Jennifer Clayton, from Salt Lake City, Utah, after they were abandoned because of their special needs.

The 38-year-old is currently proud 'mum' to four dogs she has adopted as her own, as well as two foster dogs.

She has also fostered many more whom she has helped find permanent homes.

The Facebook page, titled For the Love of Ruby, has more than 37,000 likes and also features Ms Clayton's other dogs

Ms Clayton adopted her first dog 15 years ago, an Australian shepherd mix Chester, followed by blind chihuahua Chino, paralysed chihuahua Gideon and Ruby, who was born with a cleft lip and palate.

She's also taken in foster dogs Zee, a pit bull mix with one eye, chihuahua Jimmy and Cupid, a beagle-terrier cross who suffers from a neurological condition which makes it difficult for her to walk.

The Utah Animal Advocacy Foundation worker said: 'I have always loved animals. When I was 19, I was working as a dog trainer and visited a local shelter for the first time.

'I was shocked to learn that the majority of the animals there would not make it out alive and I was determined to do something about it. I've been working in rescue ever since.

The rescue worker says that 'people aren't sure what will be involved in caring for a special needs pet' and shy away from adopting them

The dog-lover maintains that she is able to see past the canines' disabilities. 

'Every animal has something unique that makes you fall a little in love with them,' Ms Clayton said.

'It's incredibly humbling to have an animal show you love and trust - especially when they have experienced the worst humanity has to offer. 

Ms Clayton says many of the animals were unwanted because potential owners are unsure about the work required.

Ms Clayton set up a Facebook page for Ruby that helped fund the dog's treatment

'I think the main reason disabled animals are sometimes not adopted is simply because people are afraid of the unknown. People aren't sure what will be involved in caring for a special needs pet.'

She regularly takes her dogs to veterinarian appointments and shares photos of their progress after previous lives of neglect. 

'We do occasionally come across someone who feels our efforts are being wasted on these special-needs animals, and that we should focus our efforts on animals who are 'normal' and healthy.

'At an adoption event a man once referred to Chino as a 'freak of nature' - and I decided then and there that he needed to stay with me forever, that was 12 years ago.

'I feel strongly that every animal deserves a chance - and they can do so well if they are given a chance.'

Ms Clayton is an advocate for the rehabilitation of dogs with special needs and set up a Facebook page, which now has more than 37,000 likes, after adopting Ruby when she was just a few days old.

The pit bull pup - now one - was born with a cleft lip and palate and three veterinarians recommended euthanising the animal, who had pneuomonia when she was abandoned and was not expected to survive her first night in shelter.

However, thanks to Ms Clayton's devoted care she has come  leaps and bounds.

She said: 'When I started Ruby's Facebook page, I had absolutely no idea that it would be as popular as it is now.' 

'I have loved sharing her - and the other rescued animals - with people around the world and have been so very appreciate of the support we've received in return.'

Ruby was born with cleft palate and was only able to feed from a tube for the first four months of her life

After four months only able to be tube-fed, the puppy was taken to a University of Pennsylvania surgeon and can now eat regular food.

'Ruby's followers have helped us raise necessary funds for surgery and medical procedures, and helped to find homes for some of the special needs animals in our care,' Ms Clayton said.

She sees a slow change in attitudes towards puppies with disabilities.

'We are often contacted by the parents of children with cleft palates and other physical differences, who say their children have identified with Ruby and enjoy seeing how well she is doing,

'Ruby and the other special-needs dogs featured on her page are famous and loved because of their differences, and I think there's a really important message in that.'

The rescue worker has set up giving pages to help contribute to medical needs for several dogs. 

After an operation from a University of Pennsylvania surgeon, Ruby was able to eat food normally and is now healthy
