'Easy-to-assemble' labels might adorn boxes for flat-pack beds or bookshelves - but for a house?

A Canadian company has designed a sleek 10ft by 10ft 'micro-home' with a bedroom, bathroom and kitchen that can be sent anywhere in the world and assembled within days.

And the company, based in Vancouver, claims that not only is the tiny property space effective, but it's also cost effective - priced between $25,000 and $28,000 - and good for the environment, too.

The house has been designed and built but now the company, NOMAD, is seeking funding through an online campaign to test prototypes and develop infrastructure for larger scale production.

A (small) place to call home: Canadian company NOMAD has designed a $25,000 10ft by 10ft 'micro-home' that can be shipped anywhere in the world and assembled easily by its new owners within days

The two-storey home features a living room, snug kitchen and toilet room on the ground floor, and steps lead to a double bed and closet on the first floor.

The smart interiors make the most of the space, fitting a bed beneath a
 slanted roof and the stairs above the kitchen sink. The bathroom doubles as a shower while storage can be used as seating.

The exterior comes with an optional deck
 that wraps around two sides of the home, adding a few extra feet, and 
it can also be fitted with outdoor storage lockers or sun shades.

NOMAD explains that the micro-home can be shipped anywhere on the planet and can be assembled within days.Â 

Snug: The home is fitted with a living room, kitchen and bathroom on the ground floor of the structure

Home: It is light enough to ship but durable enough to insulate and protect against the elements

Upstairs: It also makes the most of its space - doubling up storage units as seats here in the bedroom

Compact: The designers say the small home gives a green, cost-effective way to live and simplify your life

It means that the property is 
lightweight - reducing assembly time and shipping costs - and yet 
durable, protecting the owners from fire, moisture and termites.

They have used light, specialized 
layered wall panels that minimize the need for heat. The home is also 
fitted with solar panels and a rainwater collection system to lessen the
 owners' energy use.

The
 company says the home can be built in urban or rural landscapes and 
could be used as a home office or studio. It could even be used for 
shelters in disaster zones.

By
 opting for a 'build-your-own' feature, rather than a factory assembling
 the home, the property's costs are drastically reduced, the company 
explains on its website.

In a promotional video, NOMAD's president Ian Kent explains that the micro-home is a solution to the problem of costly, limited housing.

In the mail: The walls, windows and counters are sent flat-pack to the owners along with the faucet

Sleek: Sketches show the storage space in the kitchen beneath stairs that lead to the bedroom

Making the most of the space: The bathroom, on the ground floor, also doubles as a shower room

Neighborhood: The designers said the units could be used for a work space or studio in urban or rural settings, and could even be used for quick housing during natural disasters or developing countries

'The
 world would be a better place if housing was more affordable and 
accessible to everyone,' he said. 'But the reality is that 
supply and demand has made it too expensive for most - at least for the 
sized house we're accustomed to.

'If houses were smaller, more efficient 
and easier to build, this reality could change.'

He
 said that already people are shaking up their living spaces to build 
smaller homes that give them a simpler lifestyle across North America, 
Europe and the United Kingdom.

'They've taken stock of their daily lives, then dismantled and reassembled them to reflect a new personal philosophy,' he said.

NOMAD hopes to raise $120,000 online to develop the project. It has raised $23,000 so far.
