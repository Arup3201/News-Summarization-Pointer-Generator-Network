Schalke boss Jens Keller faces a defensive injury crisis for the Champions League Group G opener at Chelsea with World Cup-winning Germany defender and captain Benedikt Howedes joining a lengthy list of absentees.

Howedes did not travel to London due to a hip problem, giving Keller further cause for concern against a Chelsea side he believes is stronger than the Blues side of last term, which recorded two 3-0 victories over his men.

'Of course it's very difficult if you lose your captain,' said Keller, who said Jan Kirchhoff could return from injury.

'Central defence for us is also a very difficult situation.

'We'll just have to put four players into the back four. We've still got a bit of time to think about what our solutions are and what options we have.

'I don't know how long he'll be missing, but he is a very important player for us. He's very confident now, having won the World Cup.

'We've got lots of games ahead of us, two games a week, so we hope that it won't be too long.'

Defender Dennis Aogo said: 'We've got quite a few players missing.

'It's not easy. We've got to try to compensate and cope with that situation.

'We can't just sit here and be sorry for ourselves. The players on the pitch have to take on more responsibility.

'We're playing against some of the best players in the world here, so we don't really need any extra motivation.'

In the absence of Howedes, Schalke must bid to hold off a free-scoring Chelsea side with a 100 per cent record at the top of the Premier League.

Keller, who believes last season's semi-finalists Chelsea will go far in this season's competition, added: 'We've learnt that mistakes get punished. We learned that home and away last season.

'They're a top team and now with the new acquisitions they're even more of a top team.

'I think that Chelsea will definitely have a say in this competition.

'They're a very, very good team. They showed that last season and this season they'll be way up there.'
