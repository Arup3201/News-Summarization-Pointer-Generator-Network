Aitor Karanka says he wants to emulate the success of Steve McClaren at Middlesbrough as the pair do battle for promotion to the Premier League – but admits he won’t be afforded the funds his predecessor enjoyed.

McClaren, who takes his table-topping Derby County to the Riverside Stadium at lunchtime on Saturday, wrote his name in Boro’s history books when his side won the League Cup in 2004 – the club’s first trophy – before making it to the UEFA Cup final the following season.

He left to manage England in 2006 with the club established in the Premier League. Three years later they were relegated and Karanka is now the fourth manager since McClaren.

But the Spaniard, whose side would go top of the Championship with victory, says his task is tougher than that of the former boss.

‘There was a lot of money then,’ reflected the former Real Madrid defender. ‘Now we have had to build a team without spending too much. The only players we have paid money for are Adam Clayton and Kike. We have sold Lukas Jutkiewicz and Marvin Emnes, so the money is almost the same. So we are doing well without spending big money.

‘Maybe at that time (under McClaren) it was about paying a lot of money to convince players to come here. Now it is about getting players here who believe in the project. That’s the most important thing.’

Karanka, who was fined £2,000 and serves a one-match touchline ban after admitting an FA charge of improper conduct following his sending-off against Blackburn, added: ‘I looked at what Steve did here. If I knew now that in the future I would achieve what he did then I would be a happy man. It will take time. We are just one year in and we are in the Championship, promotion is the first step and that is very tough.’

The two managers live in the same part of North Yorkshire, and Karanka said: ‘Sometimes we have been in the same restaurant and we have a good relationship. I will pay the bill at the restaurant if we win this weekend. He can maybe pay my fine!’
