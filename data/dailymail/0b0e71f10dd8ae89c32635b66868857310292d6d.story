Florence Welch is the latest younger woman to have caught the eye of actor Sean Penn.

The Florence And The Machine star met him at the Gucci Art charity event in Los Angeles two weeks ago and they hit it off instantly.

Now sources say that 52-year-old Penn has asked to meet up with her again. 'Sean was flirting with her all evening and they got along like a house on fire,' said an insider.

Paul Weller's model daughter Leah is engaged.

Leah, who at 21 is just four years younger than the 54-year-old rocker's second wife Hannah, has accepted a proposal from Japanese model Tomo Kurata, 23.

'We may be young, but I want to make Leah my wife,' Tomo told me at the launch of Uniqlo's Heattech collection.

'Leah has met my family in Japan and I'm sure we will have children one day.'

However, Leah, who is a megastar in Japan and the face of DJ Fearne Cotton's clothing range for Very.co.uk, refuses to babysit her father's ten-month-old twins.

'I love those babies, but I'm scared of looking after small children,' she said.

The cast and crew of a production of Chekhov's The Seagull have new Downton Abbey star Lily James to thank for saving the day.

Crowd pleaser: Lily James had audiences flocking to The Seagull

The drama, which opened earlier this month at London's Southwark Playhouse, was almost cancelled because of a lack of funding.

But four days before the opening night, Lily, appeared as flirtatious Lady Rose in the Downton finale â€“ and the 150-seat theatre sold out.

Thanks to the 'Downton effect', the show could now head for the West End and glamorous Lily is also being tipped for Hollywood success.

'There are lots of Downton fans coming to the show and Lily has a brilliant following,' says Emily Dobbs, her co-star in The Seagull.
