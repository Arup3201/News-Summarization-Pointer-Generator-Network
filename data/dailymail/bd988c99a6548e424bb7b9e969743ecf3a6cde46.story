Labour leader Ed Miliband was today accused of wanting to 'forcibly rip-up' the countryside under controversial plans to allow towns and cities to spread.

He used a major speech on housing to vow to take on ‘stick-in-the-mud’ rural and suburban councils that are refusing to build new homes.

He condemned the Government’s hugely controversial reforms of the planning system  to encourage development as ‘tinkering’.

Labour leader Ed Miliband, who today visited Chrysalis Park housing development in Stevenage, argued that cities and towns should be able to expand

Places such as Stevenage, Oxford, York and Luton would be handed a new ‘right to grow’, meaning the objections of surrounding authorities who block the construction of new homes would be overridden.

But the Tories hit back at the idea of allowing metropolitan councils - which are often Labour-run - to force through house building in rural areas which are more often Conservative-controlled.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said: 'Labour’s policy shows this is the same old Labour party.

'They would allow Labour councils to forcibly rip up Green Belt protection in neighbouring councils. While their new tax on planning permission would reduce housebuilding and discourage regeneration schemes. We know there is more to do to help build homes.

'But this must be done by working with hardworking families in communities across Britain, allowing councils to shape where development should and shouldn’t go via Local Plans, and safeguarding important environmental protections.’

It marks an escalation in the increasingly heated debate over 
planning, and pitches Mr Miliband into an angry confrontation with shire councils 
and countryside campaigners.

The Labour leader condemned ‘home-blocking councils’ on the borders of towns and cities and also attack ‘land-hoarding developers’ who sit on plots even after they are granted planning permission.

The Coalition’s attempts to speed up and encourage development has been condemned by organisations such as the National Trust.

But Mr Miliband, speaking in Stevenage, where proposed development beyond its borders has been stalled for years, insisted that the shortage of new homes is a serious threat to Britain’s future prosperity.

Labour is to set up an independent 
commission on housing, to be headed by former council chief executive 
and BBC chairman Sir Michael Lyons.

It
 will draw up detailed plans on how to increase the construction of new 
homes in England to more than 200,000 a year by the end of the next 
parliament if Labour wins power.

Mr
 Miliband said: ‘I want to send a clear message today: We will tackle 
those councils that block homes, those developers that hoard land and 
this government that fails to act on the worst housing shortages for a 
generation.

‘We will stand up for home builders and 
first-time buyers and take on those who stand in the way of working 
people and their children having the decent homes they deserve.’

Mr Miliband said that Labour would side with local authorities such as Stevenage that want to build new homes – and condemn those such as  neighbouring North Hertfordshire Council that systematically block such development.

He announced that four Labour-controlled councils – Stevenage, Oxford, Luton and York – have signed up to become the first ‘right to grow’ local authorities where there is immediate potential to build 40,000 new homes.

Mr Miliband praised Stevenage as ‘an example of how successful new towns  can be’ and attack neighbouring North Herts as a ‘stick-in-the-mud’ council that was home-blocking.

The Labour leader added: ‘Of course it is right that local communities have a say about where housing goes.

‘But councils cannot be allowed to frustrate continually the efforts of others councils to get homes built.’

He also commited Labour to giving communities controversial new ‘use it or lose it’ powers to release land that is being hoarded by developers even though it has planning permission.
