After the frantic year Richie Gray has gone through, it isn’t surprising he is looking forward to a much-needed beach holiday with his model girlfriend Ellie McKeating after Scotland’s match against Canada.

The big second row is desperate to finish a hectic — and sometimes turbulent — 12 months on a high with a win in Toronto on Saturday.

Around this time last year, he was part of the victorious British and Irish Lions side that emerged victorious from Australia. Shortly afterwards, he was on a plane to France for pre-season training with his new club Castres, who he signed for from Sale Sharks.

Last hurrah: Richie Gray (L) and Grant Gilchrist will play their final game of the season against Canada in Toronto

The end is nigh: Richie Gray trains for one last game before he heads of on holiday

Apart from a brief spell when he was inexplicably dropped by interim head coach Scott Johnson at the start of the Six Nations, he has hardly missed a game for club or country since — including starting for Castres as they narrowly lost to Toulon in the TOP14 play-off final two weeks ago.

Following that match, he was straight on to a flight to North America from Paris to prepare for Scotland’s first match against the USA in Houston.

An ankle injury in the first half to fellow lock Jim Hamilton — that has ended his tour — and a lack of other second-row options on the bench meant Gray had no choice but to play the whole 80 minutes in the searing heat.

He will called upon again against the Canadians this weekend, where he will partner Grant Gilchrist, in what will be the final match of his busy rugby schedule.‘It is getting to that stage of the season when the boys, including me, are not feeling their freshest — but it is great to be with them, so I will enjoy it as much as I can when I am here,’ said Gray.

‘I have only one game left and I want to finish my season on a high with a win over Canada and after that I will be switching off from rugby for a while.

No cigar: Richie Gray came close to winning the TOP14 play-off final with new club Castres

‘I am looking forward to lying on a beach for a couple of weeks as it will be good just to shut down completely from rugby because it has been pretty full on for a year.

‘I had the Lions tour last summer, the move to Castres and everything that has gone in between with Scotland.

‘I haven’t really had a chance to reflect on it all but I will after the Canada game that’s for sure. 

‘Being with Scotland has been great because it’s a nice way to end what’s been an incredible year for me. It’s one I won’t forget, that’s for sure.’

Main man: Richie Gray has been earmarked as one of Scotland's most important players by Vern Cotter

The 24-year-old will shoulder more responsibility in the run-up to the 2015 Rugby World Cup. At Scotland training sessions this week, new head coach Vern Cotter has taken him aside to discuss privately what he expects from the man he has already earmarked as one of his important players.

‘Vern has been very involved with us this week and he wants us to play in a certain way and has been going through the drills in fine detail,’ revealed Gray.

‘He wants us constantly on the move, even in training, and although it’s been tough, I am really enjoying it so far. He’s made a big impression in his first few weeks.’
