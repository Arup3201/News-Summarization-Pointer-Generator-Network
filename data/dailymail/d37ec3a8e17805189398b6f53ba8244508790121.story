Millions of women and self-employed people will have a one-off chance to boost their State pensions by buying extra credits

Millions of women and self-employed people will have a one-off chance to boost their State pensions, the Chancellor revealed yesterday.

Anyone who hits State pension age before 2016, or who has already retired, will be able to buy extra credits to push their payout above the basic level of £110.15 a week.

For a limited time they will have the chance to pay a new class of National Insurance contribution.

They will be able to boost their pension by £25 a week, increasing the maximum pension for someone on a basic payout to £135.15 a week.

The cost of the top-up will be announced next week.

The surprise move is to help the estimated 12 million pensioners who will not qualify for the new higher flat-rate State pension of around £155 a week which is being brought in on April 6, 2016.

The biggest winners will be women and the self-employed, who typically have poorer pensions.

It is thought to be the first time people already claiming a pension have been able to add to it.

Tom McPhail, head of pensions at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ‘A lot will depend on how much these top-ups cost – but you would think the Government would want to make it seem a good deal. This will go a long way to solving the annoyance of people who will be retiring under the old State pension.’There are two parts to the current State pension.

A basic element – based on the number of years someone makes National Insurance contributions – and a part that higher earners build up, known as a state second pension (S2P), once called Serps.

This can top-up the pension to £270.15 a week. Historically women have earned less than men and taken time off to have children.

As a result, they have lower State pensions, while the self-employed don’t qualify for the top-ups at all.

Currently, the average weekly State pension of a man is £148; and £131 for a woman. About 2.8 million women get less than £80 a week.

About 4.2 million self-employed only qualify for £110.15 a week.

From April 2016, with the new flat-rate State pension, the State second pension will be abolished.

Everyone with 30 years of National Insurance pay-ins who retires from then on will get about £155 a week. Those who have already earned higher top-ups will keep them.

But those who will have retired before April 2016 won’t see any boost in their pensions.

Those affected say it is unfair that someone who retires the day before the new system starts could get a pension of £110.15, while someone with an identical job history who hits pension age the following morning could get £155 a week.

To level the playing field, the Chancellor is offering these special top-ups from October 2015, giving those with low pensions who retire before April 2016 the chance to increase their payouts by buying extra National Insurance credits.

Dr Ros Altmann, a campaigner for savers, said: ‘This is not a free lunch. But it is a real chance for people to build up a much better pension provided it doesn’t cost too much.’
