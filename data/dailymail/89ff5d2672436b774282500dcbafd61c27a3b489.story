This is the heartbreaking moment the son of the soldier who was shot to death at Ottawa's National War Memorial is believed to have bid farewell to his heroic father.

The youngster, reportedly called Marcus, was pictured being carried into a funeral home in Hamilton, Ontario, by a tearful relative on Friday in the wake of Corporal Nathan Cirillo's remains.

Just minutes earlier, the 24-year-old soldier's body had been transported to the parlor in a motorcade that traveled down the Highway of Heroes in front of thousands of people.

Cpl Cirillo, a ceremonial guard, was shot dead at the memorial on Wednesday by Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, 32, a Muslim convert whose motives for killing the solider are still very much unclear.

During his funeral, his mother, Kathy Cirillo, was seen openly sobbing as she followed pallbearers carrying her son's coffin to a hearse. 

She was accompanied by other grief-stricken relatives, friends, Cpl Cirillo's colleagues and Marcus, who had reportedly just started Kindergarten this fall. 

Thousands lined the Highway to wave the Canadian flag and remember the soldier during his journey home.

As his body was transported, Prime Minister Stephen Harper made a return to the National War Memorial to mark the resumption of the honor-guard deployment, which had been suspended following Wednesday's fatal shooting.

And while Harper made no public remarks, he did take time to speak to mourners, who gave a sustained ovation when the two guards on duty today took their position at the memorial.

Meanwhile, authorities seem to still be no closer to figuring out just why Zehaf-Bibeau killed Cirillo and then opened fire on Parliament, before being shot dead.

They have revealed that there is currently no evidence the young man had terrorist ties, though he does have a long history of drug abuse and drug addiction.
