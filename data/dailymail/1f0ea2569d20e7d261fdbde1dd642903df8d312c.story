A couple were arrested at gunpoint by 18 police officers and held for four hours after a paramedic mistook their TV remote control for a gun.

Michelle Malone, 46, and Keith Abrahams, 44, were in bed when 18 officers stormed their flat and bundled them out into a police van.

The couple’s nightmare began when a paramedic was sent to their home  after Miss Malone suffered a panic attack. As he entered the bedroom to treat  Miss Malone, he spotted the remote control in Mr Abrahams’ hand. Apparently mistaking it for a gun, he immediately called police.

Michelle Malone, 46, with Keith Abrahams were arrested by armed police who stormed her home after the TV remote control was mistaken for a gun

Eighteen officers – ten of whom were 
armed and wearing body armour – then burst into the flat at 1am and the 
couple were arrested at gunpoint.

Mr Abrahams, a forklift truck driver, said: ‘I was shocked. Having guns pointed within an inch of my eyes is not the most fun.

‘I had been sitting in bed and I’d 
dozed off watching something on telly. The next thing I know I’m being 
ordered out of bed at gunpoint. It was absolutely terrifying.

With Miss Malone’s condition 
worsening the pair were taken to a nearby police station while officers 
conducted a forensic fingertip search of their flat.

Keith Abrahams says he was questioned for four hours about the 'firearm' before being released without charge

Detectives confirmed during the 
pair’s interview that the paramedic believed he had spotted Mr Abrahams 
holding a firearm. Miss Malone said: ‘The police told us the medic had 
seen a 10in long black firearm being held by Keith as he lay in bed.

‘I suffered the indignity of being treated like this all for the sake of a television remote control.
‘I can only imagine what my neighbours thought. It was like something out of a film.’

The couple said they were surrounded 
by ten armed officers wearing body armour, eight uniformed police as 
well as a dog handler during the raid at 1am on June 24 in Hereford.

Miss Malone added: ‘I just remember 
running out of bed after hearing a bang like an earthquake and seeing 
police pointing guns at Keith, who was up against the wall. We were held
at the station for four hours but released without charge.

‘I couldn’t believe it when I heard 
they were searching for a gun. I’ve never had a gun in my life – I’ve 
never even seen one before. It was just horrendous.’

Miss Malone, a former prison custody 
officer, is now taking legal action against West Mercia Police after 
suffering concussion during the incident.

She said: ‘We received no apology and
I just feel violated by their intrusive actions. The way I was treated 
in my own home was very traumatic. I already suffer from anxiety and 
then to suffer the indignity of being arrested for absolutely nothing 
has just alleviated this.

‘I suffered bruising and concussion 
because of how forceful they were, and to treat a woman in her 
bedclothes with such a degrading manner was embarrassing and upsetting.’

She added: ‘They also left my house looking like a bomb-site – it was like I had been burgled.’

Michelle is now taking legal action against West Mercia Police and has complained to the IPCC after she suffered concussion, which she says was a result of police's heavy-handed tactics

When the pair were eventually 
released from Hereford Police Station, Mr Abrahams suffered a further 
indignity when he was left to walk home in just his vest and boxer 
shorts. He said: ‘It was pretty humiliating. They took Michelle home but
I had to walk back wearing a vest and boxer shorts.’

The couple are also demanding an 
apology from West Midlands Ambulance Service which has since launched an
internal investigation into the paramedic who called police.

Yesterday a police spokeswoman 
confirmed that no firearms were found in the property and they were 
investigating the complaints raised by the couple.
