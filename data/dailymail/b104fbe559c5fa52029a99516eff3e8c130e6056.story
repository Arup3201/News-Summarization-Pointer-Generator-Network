Mesut Ozil revealed the bizarre pre-match ritual that he believes has helped him become one of the best players in the world.

The German, who has won La Liga, the FA Cup and the World Cup during his time with Real Madrid, Arsenal and the German national team, is extremely careful in his preparation.

Ozil always puts his right boot on first, and ties his laces repeatedly in knots to influence the way he plays.

As well as revealing he always puts his right boot on first, he also said he ties several knots in his boots

'For the game many tie their laces in the normal way. I make only knots,' Ozil told Adidas.

I feel more comfortable with those knots. If you do it differently and you want to stop the ball, mainly with the instep, the ball might slip and you can't take the ball well. 

'That is why I do these knots like that, since I started playing football.

'Because I'm religious I always step on the pitch with my right foot first, and put on my right boot first. 

Ozil insists putting several knots in his boots influences the way he plays during games for Arsenal

The 25-year-old says he has been doing that with his boots since he started playing as a child

The Gunners star revealed how his religious beliefs influence his pre-match ritual and his footwear

'Sometimes I forget about it, then I tie up the left shoe first. Then I take it off again and at first take on the right boot and then the left one.'

Ozil, who recovered from a slow start to the season to score once and give an assist against Aston Villa last weekend, also says he thrives on the big occassion. 

Ozil and his fellow German Arsenal star Lukas Podolski share a joke before the north London derby

'I'm not nervous, I rather look forward to these games, because in such games I can prove myself,' he said, which will encourage Arsenal fans in the week of the North London derby.

But the Gunners star is unlikely to be the life and soul of the dressing room at the Emirates on Saturday evening. 

'I'd say I'm more the quiet one,' he said. 'I concentrate on the game, I'm more into massage and concentration, and that is what runs through my mind, that I don't make mistakes.'
