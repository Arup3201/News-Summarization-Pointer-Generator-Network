A pensioner had a shock when he opened up his wheelie bin and spotted the face of a baby badger staring back at him.

Alan Davis, 67, had been tidying up his garden and was about to put bags of rubbish in the dustbin when he spotted the animal.

He believes the badger fell into the bin and became trapped after climbing along a nearby wall and nosing the lid open.

Surprise: Alan Davis was shocked to find a badger in his wheelie bin when he went to put out some rubbish

After taking some pictures of their unusual visitor, Mr Davis and his wife Joyce carefully tipped up the bin and released the badger into their garden, which borders a field in Sutton Poyntz, Dorset.

He said: 'I was tidying up the garden and went to throw some bags out and saw this head popping up, looking at me.

'It's definitely not what I expected to see. It was a baby one, and I think it must have gone in there to scavenge for food.

'They go down the side of the house, which is a badger run, a sort of road for them.

'They always go the same way, I think it's something they pass on through the generations.

'But there is some building work on the opposite side of the road and a fence was put up the day before we found the badger.

'It's blocking their usual path so I wonder if it got confused and ended up back in our garden. It's very strange but it was quite sweet really.

Freedom: The young badger was gently tipped out of the bin into the couple's garden, which backs onto Dorset fields

'We get a lot of wildlife here, and we always have foxes, badgers and deer running around the garden, which is lovely, it's like a nature reserve.'

The couple have lived at the house for five years and said it is the first time wildlife has ended up in their bin.

Joyce added: 'Alan called me when he found the badger and said he had found something interesting.

'I couldn't believe it when he told me.'

Badger setts are most commonly found in areas near woodland and shelter, and badgers are known to walk the same routes for years.

They mainly feed off earthworms but will eat whatever is available including fruit, insects and cereal.
