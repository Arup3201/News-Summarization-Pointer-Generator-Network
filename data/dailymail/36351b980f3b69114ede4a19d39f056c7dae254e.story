Found: Ella Hysom was missing for three days, but was found yesterday in east London

The parents of a deputy head girl who went missing during treatment for depression told last night of their joy at her being found alive and well.

Ella Hysom, 15, was reunited with her family following a sighting by a member of the public three days after she vanished.

A shopper, who had seen the teenager’s face on the front page of yesterday’s Daily Mail, recognised her as she walked around Ilford in east London yesterday.

The story was also prominently displayed on the MailOnline website.

Ella’s parents had made an emotional appeal for help in finding her after she disappeared on Monday close to the Ilford clinic where she was being treated.

Last night her mother Alison, 43, wrote online: ‘Thank you so, so much to everyone who has helped us search for Ella. She has been found in London and we are on our way to see her.

'We will never forget the support and kindness that we have received.

‘The advertising and awareness campaign worked.’

Speaking from the family home in Colchester, she added: ‘We are so thankful for the coverage and thank the Daily Mail. You have been brilliant.’

Her father, Tim, 43, added: ‘We really appreciate it.’ Ella was spotted ‘wandering aimlessly’ around Ilford during the late morning yesterday and the member of the public called police.

She was quickly picked up by an officer who took her to the police station on the high street before her parents collected her.

A market trader said: ‘She looked sheepish and a bit disorientated while walking with the police. I didn’t know who she was at the time and I thought she had been caught shoplifting because she was very pale.’

One policeman involved in the case said: ‘It’s great news that she’s been found as sometimes you don’t get a happy ending with these type of cases.

'I heard a member of the public saw her in town after looking at the front page of a paper and immediately rang it in. She was a bit fragile but nothing was wrong with her. God knows where she’s been.'

Ella had been receiving treatment at the clinic for six weeks. A keen rower and ballroom dancer, the teenager, who attends Gilberd Secondary School in Colchester, was described as gregarious, lively and confident.

But her parents said she had become depressed, which had made her anxious and nervous. Ella’s Facebook page suggested she had split from a boyfriend who had found a new love.

Around the time she was admitted to the residential care unit at the start of October, Ella left a series of emotional messages on Twitter.

‘The higher I get, the lower I sink. I can’t drown my demons, they know how to swim,’ she wrote. She also said: ‘I long for that feeling to not feel at all.’

Hours before she vanished on Monday she wrote online: ‘I just want to die and hopefully that will happen so I don’t have to wake up tomorrow morning.’

Last night a Metropolitan Police spokesman said: ‘Police were appealing for assistance to trace Ella Hysom, who went missing from an address in Ilford on Monday, 11 November.

'The 15-year-old has since been found safe and well. We would like to thank the media and members of the public for their assistance.’
