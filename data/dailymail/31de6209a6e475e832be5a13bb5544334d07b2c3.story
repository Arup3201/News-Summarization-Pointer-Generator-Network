James Hook will be given the chance to reignite his international career after being drafted into Warren Gatland’s Wales squad.

Some wondered whether the 29-year-old Gloucester playmaker’s days in the red jersey were over when he was omitted from last month’s 34-man squad announcement.

However, an injury to fly-half Dan Biggar has created an opening and the 76-cap utility back will travel across the Severn Bridge this morning to join the squad in Cardiff.

Wales: Leigh Halfpenny; Alex Cuthbert, George North, Jamie Roberts, Liam Williams; Dan Biggar, Rhys Webb; Paul James, Richard Hibbard, Samson Lee, Jake Ball, Alun Wyn Jones, Dan Lydiate, Sam Warburton (captain), Taulupe Faletau.

Substitutes: Scott Baldwin, Gethin Jenkins, Rhodri Jones, Bradley Davies, Justin Tipuric, Mike Phillips, Rhys Priestland, Cory Allen. 

Australia: Israel Folau; Adam Ashley-Cooper, Tevita Kuridrani, Christian Leali'ifano, Joe Tomane; Bernard Foley, Nick Phipps; James Slipper, Saia Fainga'a, Sekope Kepu, Sam Carter, Rob Simmons, Sean McMahon, Michael Hooper (captain), Ben McCalman.

Substitutes: James Hanson, Tetera Faulkner, Ben Alexander, James Horwill, Will Skelton, Matt Hodgson, Will Genia, Rob Horne. 

Contractual obligations to Gloucester mean Hook will not be available for the fourth Test against South Africa, which falls outside of the Test window, but he will be free to play in the next two fixtures, against Fiji and New Zealand.

Gatland was forced to bring in reinforcements after Biggar suffered a groin strain in Saturday’s defeat by Australia, leaving Rhys Priestland as the only fit fly-half in the squad.

Hook’s adaptability means he can also cover at full-back, where Wales will be without Leigh Halfpenny, who is sidelined with concussion.

The alternative scenario was to fast-track New Zealand convert Gareth Anscombe into the squad. The 23-year-old landed in Cardiff last night and is eligible to play for Wales through his mother, but he will instead make his debut for Cardiff Blues this weekend.

‘Gareth needs to play some rugby first,’ said Gatland. ‘It would be unfair to bring him in. He has to spend some time in the Welsh camp, experience some Welsh banter and learn his trade.’

Hook is likely to be named on the bench this weekend, with Scarlet Liam Williams expected to take Halfpenny’s place at full-back for the second round of fixtures.

Williams was one of Wales’ more impressive players on Saturday, despite being deployed in his weaker position on the wing.

He was unable to prevent Wales from suffering a 10th straight defeat by the Wallabies, part of a painfully barren run that has seen Gatland’s side lose 21 consecutive fixtures against the ‘big three’ of the southern hemisphere.

It was yet another case of conceding decisive scores at the death for the home side. Wales were leading with eight minutes to play before Wallabies fly-half Bernard Foley inevitably kicked six points to snatch victory.

Wales had taken an early lead after a third-minute try from Rhys Webb, but the scrum-half was among those at fault as a series of cheap mistakes allowed Australia back into the game.

Missed tackles from Biggar, Alex Cuthbert and Alun-Wyn Jones proved costly for two of Australia’s three first-half tries, while Webb’s 20-yard miss-pass gifted Israel Folau an interception and he cantered over from 80 metres.

‘I was happy with my try but then I gave away a silly interception,’ said Webb. ‘If it had gone to Liam Williams it would have been a different story, but it is one of those things.

‘It was there for us, but we have to take the positives.’

Prop Gethin Jenkins started on the bench but his impact in the scrum — where Wales won a 64th-minute penalty try after scores from Cuthbert and Jones — could earn the 126-cap front row a starting place against Fiji.
