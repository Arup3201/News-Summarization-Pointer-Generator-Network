A video has emerged of Sunderland's players in a nightclub in Portugal at the end of their pre-season tour.

Midfielders Lee Cattermole and Adam Johnson and skipper John O'Shea were in Vida in Albufeira.

The majority of the squad – including Wes Brown, Steven Fletcher and Jordi Gomez – were also in the club, which opens at 2am, on Sunday following their goalless draw with Vitoria Setubal on Saturday.

A spokeswoman for the club said the players were on a planned night out at the end of their week-long stay in the country.

Sunderland's tour of Portugal saw them face Recreativo Huelva, Nacional and Vitoria Setubal.

Gus Poyet's side will face West Brom in their opening game of the season in just under two weeks time.
