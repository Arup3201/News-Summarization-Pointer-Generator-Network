Wedding bells are ringing for a loved-up man who stunned his girlfriend with a heart-melting flash-mob proposal.

The grand gesture was secretly organised by Marc Fury, 34, from Cardiff, who popped the question to long-term girlfriend Naomi Coleman, 36, over dinner.

Marc arranged for choir group Sing & Inspire to turn up for the ultimate proposal, and after being serenaded by a mash-up of Bruno Mars’ ‘Just the Way You Are’ and Whitney Houston’s ‘I Wanna Dance with Somebody’, he plucked up his courage and got down on one knee.

Marc organised whole event in just three weeks, having seen a flashmob and deciding it would be the perfect way for him to pop the question

His startled partner immediately said yes before planting a kiss on his lips as the singing group and fellow-diners burst into rapturous applause.

Father-of-one Marc, who kept his big idea under-wraps for weeks, said: 'I kept the plan as close to my chest as possible so it wouldn’t ruin the surprise.

'I was really nervous, I couldn’t look at anyone in the restaurant when we turned up because I knew all the choir were already there.

'Even when people started pointing us out as the choir sang Naomi still didn’t believe it was just for us.

'It was a wonderful evening and we’ve had such a lovely response from everyone.'

Marc managed to organise the whole thing for his partner of three years in just three weeks after seeing a flashmob perform at a housing conference in Cardiff.

He admits that he doesn’t remember much of the meal before the choir got up to sing, but the proposal was unforgettable. 

Sing & Inspire serenaded the pair with  a mash-up of Bruno Mars' 'Just the Way You Are' and Whitney Houston's 'I Wanna Dance with Somebody'

'The bit 
beforehand was all a blur, don’t ask me what I had to eat,' he laughs. 
'The cue for the choir to start was for Naomi to stop eating, so I was 
just watching her and waiting. I knew that a lot of the people at the 
tables around us were part of the choir and I was trying not to make any
 eye contact with anyone.

'When
 the choir stood up and started singing around us, Naomi kept saying it 
looked like they were singing to us, but I said I didn’t have a clue and
 that it was nothing to do with us.

'She didn’t realise until I got down on one knee. It was an amazing night and we have watched the video over and over again.'

Meanwhile, Naomi, 36, admitted that she is still in shock and has still not completely taken it all in.

'Marc didn’t give a thing away, even when they got up to sing,' she says.

Naomi was so unsuspecting that when the group first started to sing she couldn't believe it was for her

'I didn’t realise until I saw him reaching into the inside pocket of his jacket. It was incredible, absolutely fabulous.'

Stef Evans, from choir group Sing and Inspire, was only too happy to help when nervous Marc asked if they could help out with his flashmob proposal.

She said: 'We had done a flash mob at a conference Marc attended and he approached us to help out with the proposal.

'Then we spoke to Karen, the manager of The Cosy Club restaurant and she was brilliant and very excited about it.'

More than forty people filled the restaurant to sing for the couple, many of them from the choir of homeless charity Llamau, but Naomi was clueless that all the fuss was for her.

Singer Stef added: 'I don’t think she realised why we were doing it even though we were standing in right in front of her.

'I don’t know how Marc managed to eat his food he was so anxious, but whose proposal can beat that?'
