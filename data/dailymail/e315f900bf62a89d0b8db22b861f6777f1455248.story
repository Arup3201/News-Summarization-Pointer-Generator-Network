Jemima the goat has given birth to four tiny kids - much to the surprise of staff who delivered them.

Even though goats usually give birth to twins, the new mother delivered double the trouble at the White Post Farm in Farnsfield, Nottinghamshire.

Staff at the farm say the foursome - named Harry, Ron, Neville and Hermione after the main characters of Harry Potter - are very mischievous, but are attracting scores of visitors.

Up to no good: The quads were named after the Harry Potter characters as they are very mischievous

Five-year-old Jemima began giving birth just before 11am on Sunday.

And when her third kid was born, farm manager Anthony Moore, 32, was surprised.

Mr Moore said: 'I couldn't believe it.

'We've sometimes had triplets and that excites us but Jemima still looked big after the three and it was clear she was still in labour. 

'Brett, the stocksman said, "I'm sure there's a fourth one", and we all had our fingers crossed because it has never happened here before.

'We were shocked when she delivered another. I've never come across quads before, it's really unusual.

'Obviously we're all really excited and they're all doing really well.

Working their charm: Staff at White Post Farm in Nottinghamshire, say the foursome are a star attraction

'They're still only hours old but they're in great nick, jumping around and getting along with each other and really playful.

'We decided to name them after the Harry Potter characters because like them, these kids are small, young and mischievous.'

The white and brown goats - whose father, five-year-old Dave  will stay together at the visitors farm with their parents.

Anthony added: 'Their only job will be to be petted and look cute - and they're doing a great job of that already'

'Dave and Jemima arrived a couple of weeks ago from a nearby farm, along with two other female goats.

Staying put: The family, pictured with staff member Sarah Hebb, will be kept at the farm with their mother and father, Dave, for the foreseeable future

'We said that Jemima looked bigger than the other two females, who are also pregnant, but we never thought she would be carrying quads.

'She's in excellent form. She needed no help at all through the labour, it was very good.

'And she's a great mum already. She's got them all cleaned up and has been feeding them.

'They're all in a nice big barn because I'm sure there will be a lot of visitors wanting to see them.

'They're all very similar in size, and all healthy.

'They'll have a lovely family group. We're all glad they've all arrived safely.'
