Roy Keane described Paris Saint-Germain defender David Luiz as 'lost' following his woeful first-half performance against Barcelona on Tuesday night.

The £50million former Chelsea man was at fault for both goals as Neymar sent the Ligue 1 side bowing out of the Champions League with little more than a whimper.

Keane, known as one of punditry's scariest characters, isn't usually one for holding back when it comes to opinions, but even he had some sympathy for the Brazilian international.

ITV pundit Roy Keane offered his sympathy to Luiz, describing the defender's performance as looking 'lost'

'I actually feel sorry for him,' the 43-year-old told ITV.

'He just looks lost again; we spoke about him before the game.

'He doesn't smell danger and the stuff there is literally schoolboy stuff.

'You've got to give the boy sympathy, a little bit. Because he doesn't look like he knows what he's doing. 

It was fellow Brazilian international Neymar that stole the headlines as his double sealed Barcelona's progression.

Neymar set the tone for the game when he slotted home the opener following some fine work from Andres Iniesta before later heading a second past Salvatore Sirigu.

And Luiz was quick to admit that his side got what they deserved across both legs of the fixture.

'They were a better team than us in both games. They controlled both games and they deserved to qualify,' he told ITV. 

'We didn't take the opportunities to score in the first match. We didn't play well, but we had seven or eight opportunities. In this game, they were better than us.' 

Neymar has been in superb form for Barcelona this season, taking his scoring tally to 30 against PSG
