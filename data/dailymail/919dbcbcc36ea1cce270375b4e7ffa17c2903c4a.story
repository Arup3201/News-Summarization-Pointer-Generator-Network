The Kentucky Higher Education Assistance Authority aims to improve the state's students' access to higher education, but a recent publication indicates that students aren't the only ones in need of some learning.

The book, sent out to every junior in the state, outlines what students need to know to prepare for college - but there's a small problem.

The word Kentucky is misspelled on the spine of the book to read 'Kentucy.'

The error has been pointed out gleefully to the KHEAA on social media.

Erin Klarer of the KHEAA told WDRB that the board is aware of the mistake.

Schools, parents and even state officials have informed staff about the typo, says Klarer.

It's embarrassing, she says, but the cost of reprinting and redistributing the book would be about $70,000.

Egg on their faces: The KHEAA says that to reprint and redistribute the book would cost $70,000, so they're going to let it stand

Consequently, she told WDRB, the KHEAA is going to just 'deal with the egg on our face.'

In an introductory note at the front of the book, Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear praises the KHEAA as 'the stateâ€™s premier college planning and financial aid publication for high school students.'

'We got these a few weeks ago from the Kentucky Higher Education Assistance Authority. Again... HIGHER EDUCATION,' tweeted a student.
