Police are appealing for help in tracing three young brothers who have gone missing from their foster family after going on a bike ride.

The boys - Remus, 15, Janko, 12 and David Matloch, 10 - took their bikes out on Monday evening but failed to return.

Shortly after leaving the foster home in Sunderland, they were spotted buying a Metro ticket to Newcastle. They were last seen at Newcastle Central Station after 6pm yesterday without their bicycles.

Northumberland police have released footage of the three Matloch brothers arriving at Park Lane Metro station in Sunderland after leaving their foster home at 5.20pm yesterday and bought tickets to Newcastle

Police later identified the three boys leaving Newcastle Central station without their bikes

They left the house at The Oaks, 
Sunderland at 5.20pm and were due to return by 8pm. The three brothers 
had said they had been going on a cycle ride to the nearby Mowbray 
Park.

Northumbria Police said they were concerned for their welfare as the boys have not been answering their mobile phones and had never previously gone missing. 

The three boys, who are Polish but speak good English, all had bicycles with them and were wearing helmets when they left.

Dark-haired Remus, who has a distinctive quiff, was last seen wearing jogging bottoms and a t-shirt; fair-haired Janko had mustard-coloured chinos with a blue waterproof.

David has shaggy dark brown hair and a chubby build and is possibly wearing shorts and a top and a silver coloured cycling helmet.

The brothers are thought to have family members in Blyth, Northumberland and South Shields.

Officers are appealing for the boys, or anyone who has any information about their whereabouts, to contact them straight away.

Police said the missing brothers were excited about an upcoming holiday this Friday and had very little money and no passports.

CCTV footage showed them entering the Park Lane Metro station around half a mile from their home without their bikes and helmets.

They were later spotted by cameras at Newcastle Central railway station - a 45 minute train journey away.

Superintendent Alan Veitch urged the youngsters, who are of Polish Romany descent, to get in touch and said police would pick them up from any location.

He told a press conference the boys grew up in Blyth, Northumberland, but had lived with foster parents in Sunderland for 18 months.

Their carers reported them missing when they were an hour late for an 8pm curfew, after going out on a cycle ride.

The boys left this private road, The Oaks, on bicycle at 5.20pm yesterday according to Northumbria Police

Remus, Janko
 and David's mother is believed to be in Poland and their father in 
Romania, and it is not known if they are aware they are missing.

Supt.
 Veitch said the boys were excited about going on a caravan park holiday
 on Friday, and two of them left behind money they had been given for 
the trip in their bedrooms.

They don't have passports and are believed to have just £60 between them.

He
 urged them to get in touch and assured them they were in no trouble and
 officers could pick them up wherever they are to take them home safe.

'We are increasingly concerned for the boys welfare and we are appealing for anyone who may have seen the youngsters travel on the Metro from Sunderland Park Lane arriving at Newcastle Central Station at 6.04pm last night.

'We urgently need to hear from anyone who saw the boys after that. We don't know if they travelled onward by rail, or if they came into Newcastle, or used another form of transport to go elsewhere.

'We are carrying out a number of enquiries to locate these young people.

So far we believe they may have been travelling to the railway station for a purpose to meet with a friend or family member.

'We would ask if anyone knows the boy's whereabouts we would ask them to contact police straight away.

'We need to know where the boys are and that they are safe. Officers are also making enquiries with family members in Blyth and South Shields and also with other forces elsewhere including the Birmingham area.'
