A  woman has been charged with assault after she allegedly threw a cup of boiling hot water in the face of a co-worker at a Sydney university cafe.

Police will allege that a fight broke out between a 53-year-old woman and a 26-year-old staff member at a cafe at the University of Technology at Ultimo, in the CBD, before the older woman threw hot water in the eye of her young colleague.

The 26-year-old was treated for burns at the Sydney Eye Hospital where she was listed as stable on Wednesday night.

A UTS spokesman told Daily Mail Australia that the university was helping police with their investigations.

'UTS was very concerned to learn of the incident, which occurred in a food outlet owned and operated by a third party, and is cooperating with NSW Police,' the spokesman said.

He said none of the staff involved were directly employed by the university as it the 'building 6 cafe' was an independently operated business.

A 53-year-old  was arrested at the scene and taken to Sydney Central Police Station where she was charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm.

She was granted conditional bail to appear at  Downing Centre Local Court on Wednesday 12 November 2014.
