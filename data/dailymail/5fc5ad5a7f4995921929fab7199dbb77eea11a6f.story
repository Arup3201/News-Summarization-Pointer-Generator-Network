A mother was left with a paralysed face and in agonising pain after being bitten by a  tick in her own back garden.

Claire Dean, 43, noticed an insect bite on her hip while gardening in September last year, but thought nothing of it.

A few days later she began suffering mysterious flu-like symptoms, and  soon found herself in crippling pain. 

A few days later she woke up with numb cheeks and noticed her face was paralysed - to the point where she looked unrecognisable  in the mirror.

She was in such agony she had to quit her job as a cleaner and  was hospitalised for two weeks.

Ms Dean remembers being bitten on her hip but thought nothing of it. Days later, she suffered flu-like symptoms which became worse until she was in agony

After carrying out tests, doctors discovered the mother-of-two had developed Lyme disease, a bacterial infection spread to humans by infected ticks.

She was prescribed antibiotics and underwent months of physiotherapy to help strengthen the muscles in her face - and is now telling her story to warn others of the dangers of tick bites.

On the day she was bitten she had been wearing jeans and a baggy jumper, which she believes the tick must have become caught in.

Ms Dean, from Castle Douglas, Scotland, said: 'I was in agony. The bites themselves weren't itchy or painful, so I didn't think they were the cause at first.

'I'm quite an active person and just put the aches and sharp pains down to my body being worn out.'

She began suffering flu like symptoms and went to Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary, when the pain in her hip and back became so severe she could hardly move.

Lyme disease is a bacterial infection spread to humans by infected ticks.

It is is the most common tick-borne infectious disease in the UK, Europe and North America.

Public Health England estimates there are 2,000 to 3,000 cases of Lyme disease in England and Wales each year, and that about 15 per cent of cases occur while people are abroad. 

Ticks are tiny arachnids found in woodland areas that feed on the blood of mammals, including humans. 

Tick bites often go unnoticed and the tick can remain feeding for several days before dropping off. The longer the tick is in place, the higher the risk of it passing on the infection.

Cases of Lyme disease have been reported throughout the UK, but areas known to have a particularly high population of ticks include Exmoor, the New Forest in Hampshire, the South Downs and parts of Wiltshire and Berkshire.

They are also found in parts of Surrey and West Sussex, Thetford Forest in Norfolk, the Lake District, the North York Moors and the Scottish Highlands.

Lyme disease can cause problems with a person's skin, joints, heart and nervous system.

It is treated with antibiotics.

She was treated for pressure sores with codeine and paracetemol, before being sent home with crutches.

The pain became increasingly worse, but she didn't want to burden her family and so tried not to complain.

She said: 'I tried to hide the pain from my kids as I didn't want to worry them, but it was getting harder to put on a brave face'

'I had to quit my job as a cleaner as I just couldn't work, I was in that much pain.

'It got so bad, my daughter called an out-of-hours doctor who visited me and gave me a morphine injection for the pain.'

Just days later, Ms Dean woke to find she'd lost feeling in both of her cheeks.

She could barely open her mouth to speak and found smiling or wrinkling her nose impossible.

Her GP performed a series of reflex test and diagnosed Bell's Palsy – a rare condition that causes temporary weakness of the facial muscles.

There is no known cure for the condition, although most people notice an improvement in their symptoms after a few weeks.

But six months on, Ms Dean's face was showing few signs of improvement.

'I was horrified that my face was paralysed, but even more so when my doctor told me that there's no cure,' Ms Dean said.

'I was told I could be paralysed for weeks, or even months. Only time would tell.'

Ms Dean, who is a single mother to Alexandra, 21, and Carl, 12, was referred to hospital.

She underwent blood tests and a lumbar punctures, which is where a needle is inserted into the lower part of the spine to look for evidence of conditions affecting the brain, spinal cord or other parts of the nervous system.

It was then revealed Ms Dean had been suffering from Lyme Disease - a bacterial infection spread to humans by infected ticks.

When doctors gave the diagnosis, she suddenly remembered she had been bitten while gardening.

She said: 'It was only then that I remembered the bites on my hip. I showed them to the doctors and they confirmed they were tick bites.

'Bell's Palsy can be caused by a viral infection, so suddenly all of the symptoms I'd been suffering made sense.'

Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne infectious disease in the UK, Europe and North America.

The ticks, which flourish in long grass or undergrowth, typically attach to deer but can also be found on foxes, badgers, mice, birds as well as domestic pets - responsible for carrying the ticks into urban areas - and humans.

Indeed, areas of undergrowth (and that includes parks and gardens as well as woodland and open country) are most likely to harbour ticks as they drop off their original hosts then climb to a point where they can latch on to other passing wildlife.

Cases of Lyme disease have been reported throughout the UK, but there are certain areas which are know to be tick hotspots. 

These include Exmoor, the New Forest in Hampshire, the South Downs and parts of Wiltshire and Berkshire.

Six months on, Ms Dean is starting to see some improvements, although she is still in pain

They are also found in parts of Surrey and West Sussex, Thetford Forest in Norfolk, the Lake District, the North York Moors and the Scottish Highlands. 

If left untreated, Lyme disease can spread causing arthritis, heart problems, muscle pain and neurological symptoms such as paralysis.

Fortunately, Ms Dean was treated with antibiotics and spent the next two weeks in hospital recovering.

But even after fighting the disease, her face still remains paralysed.

She said: 'It was awful. I was finally feeling better after getting over the Lyme disease, but my face was still such a mess. I couldn't even bring myself to look in the mirror.

'Whenever I caught my reflection, it was like a stranger looking back at me. I had no facial expression.

'I suffered for months, until I finally started receiving physiotherapy to help speed up my recovery.

'I'm still not 100 per cent, but I'm getting there now. My face muscles are getting stronger and I'm slowly beginning to move them again.

'It's hard to believe that a few little tick bites caused so many problems.

'I hope my story encourages people to take more care in their back gardens. Who knows what's lurking in your flower bed.'
