After six years of trying for a baby and two failed rounds of IVF, Ashley Moore thought she had run out of options.

A further problem was that the 32-year-old has cystic fibrosis, which can make conception difficult.

So she was astonished when, following a conversation after a family wedding, the sister-in-law she barely knew offered to become a surrogate for her and husband Alastair.

Even then there were obstacles – her sister-in-law lived in Tennessee and so Ashley’s frozen embryos had to be sent across the Atlantic to the US.

But all went well and Ashley and Alastair now have a healthy son, Emerson.

Ashley said she was ‘beyond amazed’ when Michelle Moore, who is married to Alastair’s brother Dominic, offered surrogacy as a solution.

‘We had tried all we could and it wasn’t going to work out,’ Ashley said. ‘But for all the doors that closed a window had just opened and it just felt like it was meant to be. It was such a relief after so many years of hitting stumbling blocks.

‘I didn’t know Michelle that well. I wasn’t particularly close with her because we hadn’t spent much time together. We certainly weren’t close enough to expect such an amazing offer to be made.

‘Even then, you can’t help but think, “Can we deal with all the things we need to deal with to make this happen?” There are lots of costs and legal issues with a surrogacy.’

After getting approval from their doctors, they went ahead and Emerson was born in June.

Ashley, who is originally from Texas and is a volunteer fundraiser for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust, met entrepreneur Alastair, 34, while attending a university summer school in London.

The couple married in April 2005 and began trying for a baby late in 2006. After 18 months without success they were referred for fertility treatment, but Ashley struggled to complete courses of medication because of bouts of ill health.

Eventually, in 2012, she received two rounds of NHS-funded IVF treatment, both of which failed because of what doctors suspected was a problem with her womb lining. The couple’s NHS funding had run out and they felt there were no more options open to them.

They had met Michelle, 34, only a few times because she and Dominic, 30, lived in her native Tennessee with daughter Maddy, four.

After doctors agreed to the plan, Ashley and Alastair, right, sent their embryos to the US to be implanted

Michelle and Dominic, right, with daughter Maddy, moved to London when Michelle fell pregnant so Ashley, second left, could attend all the pre-natal scans until Emerson was born in June last year weighing 7lb 13oz

But when Ashley talked of her worries about conceiving to her following a family wedding in France in July 2012, she made a serious offer to be their surrogate.

A year later, two rounds of frozen embryos were shipped to the US. The first, in August 2013, failed but the second, in October, was successful.

Ashley said: ‘They held up the positive test on Skype and told us it was a yes. I took such a deep breath because of the shock I started coughing really badly. When you hear “no, no, no” for so long you don’t know how to handle it when it is finally a “yes”.’

Michelle and Dominic moved to London and Ashley attended all the scans and appointments.

She said: ‘I cannot speak highly enough about Michelle and how she made me feel during the pregnancy. I did worry if I was going to be too jealous that it was her and not me that was pregnant, but she did the very best job that was possible to make it feel ours.’

Emerson was born by planned caesarean section weighing a healthy 7lb 13oz and was given Michelle’s maiden name Okon as a middle name in her honour. Ashley said: ‘There he finally was, after all the effort and the hard work and the waiting and the tears. I got the first cuddle, which was just amazing.

‘There’s nobody higher in my books than Michelle. What can you say about somebody who gives you the ultimate gift?’

Michelle said: ‘I could see how much she wanted her own child. It felt like the right thing to do.

‘[Dominic and I] wanted Maddy to have a playmate but, at the same time, we’d decided not to have any more children. So giving Maddy a cousin was the perfect solution.’

Alastair said: ‘It’s amazing being a dad, I love it, and we can’t thank Michelle enough.’
