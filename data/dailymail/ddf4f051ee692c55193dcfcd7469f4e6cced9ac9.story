Only when one of the most senior church leaders in North East England applied some pressure did the newly-appointed Sunderland boss finally issue a statement denying he was a fascist.

For three days he had steadfastly refused. For three days both Paolo Di Canio and his employers at Sunderland had responded to anyone who dared question the Italian's appointment with a misguided mixture of anger and hostility.

When David Miliband resigned as the football club board's vice-chairman on Sunday night, citing Di Canio's 'past political statements', Sunderland failed to even mention the departure of the ex-foreign secretary in the statement that amounted to their first bungled attempt to bury the controversy.

When journalists asked their 
questions at his official unveiling at the club's training ground on 
Tuesday, Di Canio called time on a heated exchange by rising from his 
seat and walking out.

When the former Swindon manager was 
then asked, in a separate media briefing, if he would meet members of 
the Durham Miners' Association who have been so offended by his 
politics, his response was: 'Why should I?'

Even when the leader of Sunderland 
City Council said a lack of clarification could result in a serious 
fracture in their relationship with the club, there appeared to be a 
distinct lack of action.

But when the Dean of Durham joined 
the chorus of disapproval by writing an emotional open letter to Di 
Canio yesterday, the 44-year-old finally attempted to draw a line under 
the issue with a statement on the Sunderland website.

He said: 'I have clearly stated that I
do not wish to speak about matters other than football; however, I have
been deeply hurt by the attacks on the football club.

'This is a historic, proud and 
ethical club and to read and to hear some of the vicious and personal 
accusations is painful. I am an honest man, my values and principles 
come from my family and my upbringing.

Controversial: Do Canio's appointment has caused uproar among fans and those opposed to fascism

'I feel that I should not have to 
continually justify myself to people who do not understand this, however
I will say one thing only - I am not the man that some people like to 
portray.

'I am not political, I do not 
affiliate myself to any organisation, I am not a racist and I do not 
support the ideology of fascism. I respect everyone.

'I am a football man and this and my family are my focus. Now I will speak only of football.'

'I am not political, I do not affiliate myself to any organisation, I am not a racist and I do not support the ideology of fascism. I respect everyone. I am a football man and this and my family are my focus. Now I will speak only of football'

Paolo Di Canio, Sunderland manager

Despite his protestations, there is 
strong evidence linking Di Canio to fascism, but until yesterday the 
Italian had steadfastly refused to be drawn on his political beliefs.

But the letter from the Very Reverend
Michael Sadgrove proved impossible to dismiss. A Sunderland supporter, 
the Dean wrote of how Di Canio's appointment 'raises very difficult 
questions'.

He said he was 'the child of a Jewish
war refugee who got out of Germany and came to Britain just in time', 
some of whose 'family and friends perished in the Nazi death camps... So
I find your self-confessed fascism deeply troubling.

'Fascism was nearly
the undoing of the world,' he added.

'Mussolini, who you say has been deeply misunderstood, openly colluded with it.'

He pointed out that the North East 
has been 'fertile ground' in which the British National Party has sown 
'the seeds of its pernicious and poisonous doctrine' and warned: 'Unless
you clearly renounce fascism in all its manifestations, you will be 
associated with these toxic far-right tendencies we have seen too much 
of in this region.'

Down to work: Di Canio took charge of his first training session at Sunderland today

Paul Watson, the leader of Sunderland City Council and a Labour member, had spoken on Tuesday.

'Sunderland AFC is a private business and we wouldn't be dictating to them about their morals and ethics,' he said.

Then he added: 'But we would expect to hold them high if they want to continue working with us.

'This is an unprecedented situation. 
We have just given a significant grant to the Wear Anti-Fascist League, 
which puts into context where the city council stands. The people of the city would expect us to take a moral stance on this.'

Last night the Durham Miners' Association showed the first signs of seeking a truce with the club's new coach.

Dave Hopper, the general secretary of
the DMA, said: 'We think this (Di Canio's statement) is the solution to
the problem. It takes a brave man to put forward what he has, given the
past few days. We hope it's sincere.

'If it is then we can put to bed our 
issue and let Paolo Di Canio get on with what he's been brought here to 
do. The club have come around and we hope there's cognisance of people's
feelings in future before making appointments.'

Dear Paolo Di Canio,

We have never met, and I am the first to admit that I don't know very much about football. You do, and I respect that. However, I hope you will allow me to say something about your appointment as manager at Sunderland FC as personally as I can.

My relationship with the Black Cats goes back a long way. I married into a family of fervent lifelong Sunderland supporters.

My wife and I got engaged on Cup Final Day 1973, figuring that if Sunderland won her father would say yes to anything and if they lost, he would be past caring.

All these years we have wanted SAFC to do well. We have been glad when it did, and sad when it didn't. We know how much its football success has meant for the people of Sunderland and the North East who are rightly proud of your new Club.

But today I am wondering what to do. Your appointment raises very difficult questions. You see, I am the child of a Jewish war refugee who got out of Germany and came to Britain just in time.

Some of her family and friends perished in the Nazi death camps. So I find your self-confessed fascism deeply troubling. Fascism was nearly the undoing of the world. It cost millions of innocent lives. Mussolini, who you say has been deeply misunderstood, openly colluded with it.

You are said to wear a tattoo DUX which speaks for itself. This all adds up to what I find baffling.

You say that you are not a racist, but it needs great sophistication to understand how fascism and racism are ultimately different.

I can promise you that this distinction will be lost on the people of the North East where the British National Party is finding fertile ground in which to sow the seeds of its pernicious and poisonous doctrine. You did not necessarily know this before you came.

But I believe that unless you clearly renounce fascism in all its manifestations, you will be associated with these toxic far-right tendencies we have seen too much of in this region.

At your press conference today, you had the chance to do this, to say in so many words that you have been misunderstood (just as you say Mussolini was).

You were asked where you stood on fascism, but declined to give an unambiguous response. One sentence is all that it would have taken. I'm genuinely perplexed as to why you didn't take the opportunity that was handed to you. Maybe your minders told you to stay on-message.

But don't you see that it is no answer to plead that this press call was about football, not politics. Where a Premier League club is concerned, you can't ever separate the two.

Politics and high-profile sport, like religion, are about the whole of life. Football is deeply political. To say otherwise may be convenient, but it's naive.

Premier League players and managers are big role-models for the young. Is fascism what you or Sunderland FC want our children and teenagers to admire and emulate?

And if this doesn't trouble you personally, should it not trouble those who appointed you? The Club now stands to suffer loss of support as well as see its standing and respect damaged not just in this part of the world but internationally. Its reputation has been hard won.

I am just one of thousands who would be sad to see it squandered.

So there it is. Please tell me how to go on supporting the Black Cats with a good conscience, even from the sofa, because believe me, I want to.

Please tell me that I have misunderstood, or missed some fundamental issue here. I am simply telling you with a heavy heart that it feels hard at the moment to stay loyal.

Yours sincerely,

Michael Sadgrove
