A rocky lookout with niches for lanterns and a subterranean cave complete with a secret waterway entrance have shed more light on the life of 17th century pirates.

The two locations in the Republic of Ireland are believed to have been used by a group of 17th century pirates and smugglers, but remain unexcavated, with possible treasure thought to rest nearby.

Historians believe the secret spots could have been used by a powerful alliance that was destroyed in a huge battle in 1614 when it was at the height of its power.

Archaeologists have discovered two sites that they are sure were used by pirates, one of which is located at a place known today as 'Dutchman's Cove', east of Baltimore in county Cork. The location has niches for candles or lanterns (pictured) that would have been used to signal to pirates in the darkness

The area was dominated by English 
pirates in the 17th century because there was a crackdown on pirates in southern England by James I.

Private sailors who made a living 
fighting the Spanish moved to Munster to make a living once peace was 
declared. Munster at the time was a British colonisation experiment.

The
 local economy was buoyed by loot stolen by pirates who largely escaped 
the law because of Munster’s location and cooperation by local 
officials, Ms Kelleher explained.

Pirates typically paid three times 
the price for local goods in return for smuggling their loot ashore 
without any problems, so that local business people grew rich.

The practice even helped to fund exploration and colonisation projects in the Americas, such as Jamestown in Bermuda.

Ms
 Kelleher said: ‘Legitimate businessmen and merchant venturers were 
deeply involved, as it was assured access to venture capital, that was, 
in turn, invested in colonial ventures elsewhere in the New World, which
 was opening up to the maritime empires globally at this point in time.’

The alliance that operated off the southwest coast of Munster at the time was wealthy and elected its own admiral, but was ultimately destroyed by a Dutch fleet, according to historians.

Archaeologists have discovered two sites that they are sure were used by pirates, one of which is located at a place known today as ‘Dutchman’s Cove,’ east of Baltimore in county Cork.

The site has niches for candles or lanterns that would have been used to signal to pirates in the darkness.

While it might not have been used in the 17th century, underwater archaeologist Connie Kelleher, who discovered the site, told Live Science that it would have been ‘used over a very long period by pirates, smugglers and others who wanted to do secret things’.

Another site nearby called Gokane Point led to a subterranean cavern that could be accessed by a boat via a small waterway – ideal for unloading stolen booty.

Both the sites are unexcavated and 
were found by Ms Kelleher, who works for the Ireland National Monuments 
Service's underwater archaeology unit.

An
 expert in 17th century pirates, she said: ‘One pirate haul is said to 
have been worth, in today's money, some $7 million. This was an 
amazingly lucrative commercial venture, and this is why it was so 
successful.’

The pirate 
alliance in Munster was largely made up of Englishmen as well as Irish, 
Flemish and ‘renegade’ Dutchmen, according to records.

Ms Kelleher said they show that Arthur Drake, who was lieutenant to pirate Captain Robert Stephenson, was the only black man to have held a position of command in the motley crew.

She plans to search Crookhaven Harbour, close to Gokane Point, for the remains of the destroyed alliance fleet and there is the prospect of finding treasure there, according to a list describing the loot on-board one of the ships.

‘Certainly part of the lower hulls and its cargoes could be there - things that were in the hold of the ships,’ she said.

‘Similarly, if a ship exploded, then material could be scattered, and we could be dealing with a wider archaeological site.’

While it would be difficult to tell if any ships did indeed belong to pirates, if they were found and identified, the ships would be the first pirate-associated wreck found in Irish waters.

Piracy at the time was a lucrative venture and it is thought some treasure might still be lost at sea nearby
