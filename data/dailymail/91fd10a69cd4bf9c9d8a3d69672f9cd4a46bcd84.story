An excellent strike from Bojan Krkic wasn't enough for Stoke as the Potters continued their search for a first pre-season victory following a 2-1 defeat by Schalke.

The Potters had taken the lead in the 55th minute through Bojan - his first goal since his recent arrival from Barcelona.

Stoke: Begovic (Butland), Wilson (Muniesa), Shawcross, Huth (Teixeira), Pieters, Bojan (Crouch), Whelan (Palacios), Ireland, Nzonzi, Arnautovic, Diouf (Adam).

Subs not used: Shotton, Ness, Shea.Â 

Goal: Bojan 55

Schalke starting XI: Fahrmann, Ayhan, Santana, Matip, Fuchs, Aogo, Neustadter, Meyer, Sam, Barnetta, Chuopo-Moting.

Goals: Matip 58, Barnetta 85.

But Schalke soon hit back as goals from 
Joel Matip three minutes later and a Tranquillo Barnetta strike five 
minutes from time helped turn the game around in the Bundesliga side's 
favour.

The Potters were also left to reflect on missed chances with Marko Arnautovic seeing his first-half penalty, which he won after being brought down, saved.

Marc Wilson was also forced off injured in the first half joining Wilkinson and Bardsley in nursing niggles at the right back position.

Stoke's latest defeat in Germany follows a 2-0 loss by 1860 Munich as well as a 1-1 draw with Borussia Monchengladbach.

Despite failing to win any of their three pre-season games in the country, Potters fans will take positives from Bojan's contribution after a precise strike gave Mark Hughes' side the lead at the Kufstein Arena.

The former Barcelona forward showed neat skill to beat his marker from the edge of the box, before quickly firing a snap shot past the stranded Schalke keeper 10 minutes after the break.

A Matip header saw Schalke quickly hit back and after Bojan departed in favour of Peter Crouch, the Potters soon began to tire.

A build up of Schalke pressure finally became too much for the Potters as Barnetta raced through on goal in the final five minutes to tuck a neat finish under Jack Butland.

Stoke's lack of match fitness will concern Hughes, but the Potters still have four pre-season friendlies to play against Burton, Blackburn, Real Betis and a return to Germany when they take on Freiburg.
