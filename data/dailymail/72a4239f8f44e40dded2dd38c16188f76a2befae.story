The trail of devastation left by Hurricane Sandy has been long and trying for those still overcoming setbacks.

An estimated 300 residents in Hicksville, Long Island, took to the street on Saturday protesting the Long Island Power Authority at its headquarters for ongoing power outages 12 days after the storm hit the area -- the second protest against the energy provider this weekend.

There are still over a quarter million New York customers without power. As of Friday more than 170,000 of those customers were on Long Island, many of them staying in temporary shelters.

More than 500 angry LIPA customers 
in Oceanside staged a similar protest at a LIPA news conference on 
Friday saying the energy provider was giving them the run-around and 
they wanted to know why, CBS reported.

Many of the protestors were chanting 'LIPA sucks.'

 utilities have taken heat for being slow to restore power throughout 
the region. For a large number of those without power, no electricity 
means no heat, hot water or hot meals.

New Yorkers also faced their second day 
of gasoline rationing under a system introduced in New Jersey last week,
 in which cars with odd- and even-numbered license plates can fill up 
only on alternate days.

‘It's been terrible,’ Diane Uhlfelder, a former New York City police officer at the protest in Hicksville, told a Reuters reporter.

‘The kids have been out of school for more than a week,' Uhlfelder said. 'All the food is totally ruined, it's expensive eating out every day, so most of the time it's McDonald's, but the cold is the worst. It's been hell.’

Sandy battered the East Coast on October 29, killing at least 120 people and causing an estimated $50 billion in damage.

The storm destroyed homes around New York City and along the New Jersey Shore, cut off electricity for millions of people and knocked out much of the public transportation system.

Newly re-elected President Barack Obama is set to visit some of the hard-hit areas of New York City on Thursday. Obama put off an earlier visit at the request of Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who feared it could hinder relief efforts and put an additional strain on resources, such as available police officers.

Early on Saturday in Far Rockaway, a coastal area of New York City devastated by the storm surge, more than 500 people lined up with empty fuel cans.

Word had spread Friday night that a tanker truck carrying 8,000 gallons of free gasoline was to arrive around 10am.

The fuel was delivered under the auspices of the Fuel Relief Fund and apparently funded by an anonymous donor.

‘The guy didn't want his name used, but he wanted to get gas to these people,’ said a New York Police Department captain, who declined to give his name because he was not authorized to speak to the media. ‘Pretty decent thing to do,’ he said. ‘These people need it bad.’

Rockaway. Widespread delays were reported on New Jersey commuter trains.

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who toured the Jersey Shore on Friday, said many popular vacation spots will not be fully rebuilt by next summer.

‘This is our Katrina,’ he declared, referring to the hurricane that washed out New Orleans in 2005.

Homeowners were able to return to an 18-mile (30-km) barrier island off New Jersey's Atlantic coast on Saturday, giving some of them their first view of the devastation wrought by Sandy.

Long Beach Island, an enclave of mostly affluent vacation homes, took a direct hit, with some homes washed full of sand and seawater and others destroyed.

The island, with about 10,000 year-round residents and perhaps 10 times that number in the summer, has been closed to residents except for brief visits to retrieve belongings.

There were 289,239 customers without power on Saturday in the states struck by Sandy, a drop of 144,901 from Friday, the U.S. Energy Department said. At the peak 8.5 million were without power.
