Debenhams issued a profit warning today following a nightmare Christmas which forced it to launch early sales and deep discounts.

Britain’s second-biggest department store group said profits are expected to be down by 26 per cent in the first half of its financial year to around £85million.

The chain is slashing prices by 70 per cent in its January sale in a desperate attempt to shift Christmas stock.

Its share price fell more than 10 per cent in early trading today, wiping £140 million off its stock market value.

Birthday blues: Debenhams, which celebrated its 200th birthday this Christmas, has warned of a 26 per cent profits plunge as a hoped-for sales surge failed to materialise

City analyst believe sales in many leading chains were below expectations over the crucial festive trading period.

As a result, shares in the likes of Marks & Spencer, Next, Primark, Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons have all been marked down in recent days.

Debenhams’ bosses described festive trading as ‘extremely difficult’ and competitive with a large number of early sales.

They said: ‘We did not experience the anticipated final surge in sales in the last week of the period and as a result we expect the need for additional markdown to clear stock in January and February.’

The five-year cost of living squeeze, bad weather and a shift to internet shopping appear to have combined to pile pressure on retailers who rely on their bricks and mortar outlets.

Major retailers were effectively forced to bring forward their sales and bargain promotions ahead of Christmas during what one industry insider described at the time as ‘a bit or a blood bath’.

Debenhams and House of Fraser ran a series of one day sales and promotions in a bid to tempt shoppers. John Lewis was dragged into the fray under its price match promise.

As a result, the value of sales through John Lewis department stores is likely to have been hit.

Bosses at Marks & Spencer felt they had no choice but to run a 30per cent off ‘Magic and Sparkle Spectacular’ on the last Saturday before Christmas. It was the first time it had run such a wide-ranging promotion since the financial crisis was at its height in 2008.

Other leading chains like Gap and Laura Ashley also ran deep price cuts ahead of Christmas.

Weather woes: Debenhams blamed bad weather for having an impact on clothing sales, which fell over the 17-week period to December 28.

Debenhams chief executive, Michael Sharp, said: ‘The market was highly promotional in the run-up to Christmas and we responded to these conditions to ensure our offer was competitive.

‘However, this extremely difficult environment has inevitably had an impact on both our sales and profitability.

‘Looking forward, I expect conditions to remain highly competitive as we enter 2014. Everyone in the organisation is focused on improving performance and growing the business.’

He described the scene on high streets ahead of Christmas as a ‘sea of red’ – referring to the garish red sale banners that appeared in windows.

The firm’s website did achieve some successes with sales of beauty, home and gift products up by 17per cent on a year ago.

The chain is currently running what it calls its biggest ever half-price sale across the store in order to shift unsold Christmas stock.

The group told the City that pre-tax profits for the first half of its financial year are now expected to fall to £85 million from £114.7 million the year before.

The gloomy trading update comes days after reports that Debenhams was under pressure to axe finance chief Simon Herrick amid shareholder concern over his performance.

Mr Herrick has been under fire over a so-called ‘Santa tax’ letter hitting suppliers with demands for discounts days before Christmas.

Retail analyst Andrew Wade said: ‘It looks like they’ve obviously had a very challenging Christmas period. While this is obviously a very disappointing update we don’t necessarily expect this to be repeated across the retail space.’

Meanwhile Sterling was up one cent today against the dollar at 1.65 US dollars, approaching a three-year high. It has also strengthened by a cent against the single currency to 1.20 euros.

The FTSE 100 Index ended 2013 on a high, climbing 17.8 points to 6749.1 before closing at lunchtime.

It left the benchmark index less than 200 points below its all-time peak of more than a decade ago and is 14 per cent ahead over the course of the year.

Analysts and investors have predicted London's top flight will crash through the 7,000 level during 2014.
