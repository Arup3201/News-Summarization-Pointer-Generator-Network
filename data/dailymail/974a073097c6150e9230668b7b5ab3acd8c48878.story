Developing countries have called for 
legally-binding rules that force rich countries to provide money when 
they are affected by extreme weather events such as Typhoon Haiyan.

Currently, wealthy nations such as Britain offer donations following a natural disaster.

But last night a group of nations came together to argue extreme events, such as droughts or
 typhoons, are 
becoming more frequent because of man-made global warming.

Uproar: The summit in Warsaw was rocked by proposals for rich nations to pay 'compensation' for natural disasters

Brazil's representative called for countries which industrialised earlier - such as Britain - to bear the brunt of the financial burden because they have had higher greenhouse gas emissions for longer.

The issue has threatened to derail a 
fragile consensus at the two-week UN summit in Warsaw, which was meant to end last 
night, with talks instead expected to continue well into this morning.

In a heated debate last night, the 191 nations addressed the idea of some members paying ‘compensation’ to poor countries for natural disasters.

A group of 130 nations led by China even called for scientists to examine historical emissions dating back to the time of the industrial revolution in 1850.

The principle has dominated the negotiations at Warsaw, with Britain and other developed nations refusing to countenance the idea of an automatic compensation fund, concerned over the repercussions over legal liability.

Debate: The summit's president Marcin Korolec chaired the debate suggesting nations that industrialised earlier should have to donate more money to countries afflicted by natural disasters

Bangladeshi envoy Quamrul Chowdhury said the agreement was vital. ‘We won’t leave Warsaw without it,’ he said. ‘We can’t afford to.’

Energy Secretary Ed Davey last night insisted no compensation would be agreed.

‘We aren’t discussing compensation - that is a red line for us,’ he said.

But the Liberal Democrat hinted that a compromise might be met with funding instead put into ‘adaptation’ projects such as flood defences and drought resistant crops.

Connie Hedegaard, EU commissioner for climate action, said: ‘We cannot have a system where there will be automatic compensation whenever severe weather events happen in one place or another around the planet. You can understand why that is not feasible.’

The World Bank estimates that economic losses caused by extreme weather currently stand at £120billion a year.

Negotiators were becoming increasingly frustrated by the issue, which they said was a ‘distraction’ from the main aim of the talks – to agree rules to bring down international emissions.

They accused green campaign groups of whipping up anger among the world’s poorest countries on the issue and blamed them for risking derailment on the main issues.

A source close to the talks said: ‘This is an enormous distraction from the important issue of agreeing how emissions should be reduced and how we can help poor countries adapt.

‘The loss and damage agenda is being driven by a small number of countries and NGOs who want the Americans in particular to pay compensation for their past emissions. It is a symptom of an anti-American feeling in many parts of the world.’

More than 800 green campaigners staged a mass walk-out at the talks on Thursday in protest at lack of progress over the issue.

The bickering underscores the scale of the difficulty that negotiators face in forging a treaty by 2015 that could replace the Kyoto Protocol, the only international pact limiting fossil fuel emissions.

Mr Davey last night tried to shine a positive light on progress at the summit, arguing that the real aim was to sign an international agreement by 2015.

He said: ‘We didn’t come to Warsaw expecting to sign a treaty, we expected to make modest progress, the nights and bolts on the way to Paris and I think that is what we will achieve.’

Dismay: Delegates at the closing session which looked set to derail the consensus built up over two weeks

But others gave a bleaker analysis.

China’s
 lead negotiator Su Wei said the conference was ‘on the verge of 
delivering virtually nothing’. He added: ‘This week saw a finance 
ministerial with almost no actual finance, and loss and damage talks 
that have stalled because developed countries refused to engage.’

The Polish hosts of the UN talks have been criticised for poor management and contributing towards the chaos of the negotiations.

The man chairing the summit, Polish environment minister Marcin Korolec, was sacked in a government reshuffle midway through the talks.

The country, which gets 90 per cent of its electricity from burning coal, has been one of the most reluctant EU members to reduce carbon emissions.
