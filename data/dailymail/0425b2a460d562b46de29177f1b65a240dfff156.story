Radio 1's mission to attract younger listeners is under threat - because parents and grandparents are refusing to switch off.

The station has been ordered to bring the average age of its listeners down from 32 by the BBC Trust, which says it should be trying to win over 15 to 29-year-olds.

It dropped 39-year-old Chris Moyles from the breakfast show in favour of Nick Grimshaw, 28, who has lost nearly a million listeners since taking over in September.

But the over-55s are still tuning in - the only Radio 1 listeners whose numbers have increased in the past year.

Radio 2's Chris Evans, left, is trouncing Nick Grimshaw, right, by four million listeners on the breakfast show, as Radio 1 finds the over-55s are still listening to the station despite its attempts to attract those aged 15 to 29

The statistics were revealed in the 
latest round of audience ratings from Rajar, which saw the station lose 
nearly 900,000 listeners in the first three months of 2013, a loss of 1.3million listeners since the first quarter of 2012.

Radio 1's market share of over-55s has increased from 1.3 per cent to 1.6 per cent in the last year.

Its share of 25 to 35-year-olds has dropped from 25.7 per cent to 17.4 per cent - losing 300,000 in that age group.

Grimshaw's 5.8million audience is the lowest for the breakfast show since it was hosted by Sara Cox in 2003.

Meanwhile, 47-year-old Chris Evans streaked ahead of his young rival, adding 600,000 listeners to his Radio 2 breakfast show take its audience to a record 9.8million.

The four million difference is thought to be the biggest gap ever seen between the two stations.

'Radio 1 still faces significant trouble with 55+ – they just don’t want to go,' wrote radio consultant Matt Deegan, creative director of Folder Media, in a blog analysing the Rajar figures.

A reshuffle on Radio 1 saw 40-year-old Scott Mills, left, moved from the 4 to 7pm drivetime slot in favour of Greg James 27, while Chris Moyles, 39, made way for Nick Grimshaw on the breakfast show in September

'Those 55+ wedded to Radio 1 cannot be shifted and their average hours are still good – keeping the station's average age up.

'Moyles listeners were older and more passionate – he was the longest serving Radio 1 breakfast presenter after all – that means they’re going to listen longer. You churn them out and it’ll have this sort of effect.'

Radio 1 controller Ben Cooper told The Independent: 'Radio 1 is one of the most famous stations in the world and it’s a hard habit to break.'

'I’m 43 and I will always probably continue to listen to it because I love new music and I want to know what the next big thing is. There’ll always be a section of society, whatever age, who will want to do that.

'There are more older people than younger people in the UK population and that will affect our average age. You can’t tell people to stop listening.'

Greg James, left, and Jameela Jamil, both 27, have been promoted to more prominent slots on the station as Radio 1 tries to lower the average age of its audience from 32 following orders from the BBC Trust

Cooper is carrying out a two-year plan to revitalise the station. Moyles, 39, was axed from the breakfast show in September in favour of 28-year-old Grimshaw, while Greg James, 27, took over the 4-7pm drivetime slot from Scott Mills, 40.

Cooper also made 27-year-old Jameela Jamil the host of the Sunday afternoon chart show, and told the Independent he would like listening figures to include the station's YouTube channels, which attract younger listeners who prefer to get their music online.

Radio 1 stalwarts Annie Nightingale, 73, Tim Westwood, 55, and Pete Tong, 52, still present specialist music evening shows on the station.
