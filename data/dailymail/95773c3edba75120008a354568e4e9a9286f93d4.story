 

Having spent the last few months and even years perfecting and fine-tuning their facial hair, these men finally had the chance to show off their eye-catching efforts.

The eccentric selection - including musketeer moustaches and a Wotsit beard - were on display at the world beard and moustache championships in Portland, Oregon.

The event comprised 17 categories, including full natural beard, freestyle full beard and the 'garibaldi', a broad, full and round beard no longer than 20 centimetres.

Almost 300 contestants sporting bushy, fuzzy or delicately wispy hair took part in the competition from across nine countries. 

They all took to the stage in an Olympic-style procession, waving flags before the cheering throngs of spectators to determine which had the best facial hair.

The bearded entrants were judged by five people, which included Miss Oregon 2014 Rebecca Anderson and the author of 'One Thousand Beards' Allan Peterkin.

The competitors were assessed at the Keller Auditorium yesterday on how their facial hair 'enhanced their overall appearance, style and personality'.
