Maria Sharapova posted a picture of herself travelling on the London Underground on Tuesday after she had spent the day at Queen's Club.

The world No 5 won the French Open last Saturday, beating Simona Halep in the final at Roland Garros.

Sharapova was in west London to watch her boyfriend Grigor Dimitrov beat Britain's James Ward in the second round of the AEGON Championships.

World No 13 Dimitrov won 7-5, 6-3 as he stepped up his preparations for Wimbledon, a tournament he believes he is ready to win.

'I'd say my goal is to become a member at Wimbledon the easiest way possible. That is to win seven matches,' he said.

'I do believe that's possible. But I think I have to take everything step-by-step. All I have is just positive vibes every time I'm out here, and I think in England in general I feel quite comfortable. I think I have to take one day at a time.

'At the end of the day I won the Wimbledon juniors (in 2008), so of course it's a dream for me to win the real thing. Why not?'

The 23-year-old Sharapova is not scheduled to play a warm-up event before the third Grand Slam of the season in SW18 which gets underway on June 23.

The Russian won her one and only Wimbledon title 10 years ago.
