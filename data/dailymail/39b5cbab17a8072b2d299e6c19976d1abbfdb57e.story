The extent to which junk mail and nuisance phone calls had taken over my life became clear during one hellish day when I felt as though I was under siege in my own home.

On this day, my letterbox seemed to open and snap shut every 15 minutes with some leaflet or other offering a service I didn’t need.

When the junk mail wasn’t disturbing the peace, my mobile and landline were ringing with calls claiming I was due a small fortune in PPI and accident compensation or from call centres asking me to take part in endless surveys.

It all added up to an incredibly stressful day when I was unable to get any work done.

Certainly it’s a problem that has become part and parcel of modern life, but what made it all the more frustrating was that I take every step I can to ensure I’m not targeted.

I refuse to join mailing lists, I untick boxes asking if I’d like to be sent special offers, my phone number is ex-directory and I’m registered with the TPS (telephone preference service).

Clearly, though, these weren’t working. So, with a mixture of sheer frustration and morbid curiosity, I decided on that day in November last year to keep a running total of all my junk mail and nuisance calls for 12 months.

My experiment came to an end at the beginning of this month and the outcome is staggering.

Over the past year I have experienced 4,481 unwelcome intrusions into my life in the form of unsolicited post, spam emails, phone calls and texts. Of all these intrusions, it’s the junk mail that I find the most infuriating.

Deluge: 17.5billion pieces of junk mail are distributed in Britain every year

On a bad day, leaflets start dropping through my letterbox as early as 6am and can continue until as late as 10pm. Sometimes, I’ll come home after a day out to find a dozen pieces of paper strewn across my floor.

Every year around 17.5 billion pieces of junk mail, addressed and unaddressed, are distributed across the country. The average householder receives 453 of them.

On Tuesday, the Mail ran the story of Rebecca George, 44, a graphic designer from Hackney, East London, who collected 1,027 pieces of junk mail in a year.

Well,  guess what? I can do better than that. I received nearly treble the national average. This year, 1,147 items of junk were delivered to me.

My house is in a part of South London known for its young families and high-earning professionals.

And even though I don’t slot into either category, it means that if I look out of my window I rarely have to wait more than a few minutes before I see a leaflet distributor.

My tally included 91 cards from taxi firms, 76 freesheets and newspapers and 42 envelopes and bags from charities. There were also 159 takeaway menus - a third from Pizza Hut and Dominos, who rarely went a week without reminding me of their latest offers.

Endless: Spam email traffic is never-ending, and practically impossible to stem

As the value of properties in my area has risen by 25 per cent in the past year, estate agents are keen to make their presence known. There have been 123 communications, including 30 addressed to me by name from agents who, presumably, had identified me on the electoral roll.

I also received 309 flyers from companies offering every kind of service you can imagine from cleaning and gardening to baby-sitting and dog walking.

Religious groups including the Church of Scientology and Jehovah’s Witnesses left their calling cards, as did one gentleman calling himself ‘Mr Mahuba the Witchdoctor’ who, for a small fee, would place lifelong curses on my enemies.

On more than one occasion I wondered how much he’d charge for performing a little voodoo on Pizza Hut or Foxtons estate agents.

My local authority, Lambeth, has failed to see the irony of leafleting me on 24 occasions about my duty to recycle and dispose of my mail responsibly.

Of the half a million tonnes of junk mail generated in Britain every year, around a fifth ends up going to landfill sites at an annual cost to the taxpayer of £50 million. Then there is the damage to the environment. It takes 17 trees to produce each tonne of junk mail.

In the past year, there were only eight blissful days out of 365 when I didn’t receive a single flyer.

At the beginning of this year, I stuck a ‘no junk mail please’ sticker to my letterbox. A fortnight later I removed it when I realised it was making things worse.

Hefty load: Half of a postman's bag will be made up of junk, which is worth £1.1billion a year to the Royal Mail

Some mischievous distributors were taking it as a sign to dump a handful of flyers on me in one go.

When I pointed out the sticker to one young man who was about to deliver literature from a removal company, he just shrugged and said ‘no understand English’.

Increasingly, it isn’t just the door-to-door leaflet-droppers responsible for junk mail. A vast amount is delivered by Royal Mail.

In the past 12 months it delivered 226 letters and promotional mail items from companies trying to sell me everything from wine, holidays to insurance, clothes and furniture.

Ludicrously, the companies who harassed me the most were the ones whose services I already used. So much for their expensive consumer research departments!

Sky Television wrote to me 26 times trying to sell me more expensive packages or get me to switch phone provider. BT also wrote to me 16 times about their broadband or new TV sports channels.

But as any Sky or BT customer knows, when you have a problem with their products and really need to make contact, you’ve got more chance of getting through to the Prime Minister than you have of speaking to someone who can help.

I also received 63 letters from energy companies wanting me to switch my supply to them or simply justifying why they are sticking up their prices yet again. Thirty-three banks and credit companies wrote offering loans and balance transfers.

Not surprisingly, half a postman’s sack will be made up of junk post - with the Royal Mail delivering  3.3 billion items a year.

Though it offers households the chance to opt out of receiving unaddressed junk mail, since it depends on £1.1 billion a year of such business, it doesn’t make it well known. No wonder less than 1 per cent of homes have joined the scheme.

I did, however, think that registering my mobile and home phones with the Telephone Preference Service would stop nuisance calls - and until about two years ago, it did.

The service is free and it means that your number is put on a national register that marketing and telesales companies are meant to check and not contact anyone whose name appears on it.

While reputable companies abide by the rules, a growing number of rogue ones do not.

Unstoppable: Claudia was bombarded with more than triple the average amount of junk mail

It is for that reason, I assume, that over the past year I received 137 nuisance calls and 72 texts.

Some of the phone calls, particularly those from Indian-based call centres, came as early as 5am, while texts pinged up any time of the day or night.

The vast majority were from companies wrongly claiming I was owed PPI compensation or a pay-out after an accident. I also received 40 ‘silent calls’.

These are from companies using ACS (Automated Calling Systems). Targeted phone numbers are randomly chosen and automatically dialled. If you answer and an agent is available you’ll be connected.

But if you answer and no agent is free, the line just goes dead. A rather intimidating thing at 2am.

During September, a company calling itself UK Lifestyle, but using Indian call centre staff, called me 14 times asking me to take part in pointless surveys.

I’d refuse, ask them not to call again and an hour later they’d ring back as if they’d never spoken to me before.

When it comes to text messages, texting ‘STOP’ to one of the PPI companies is the worst thing you can do. It simply informs them your number is in use and leads to a flurry of additional messages.

The problem of nuisance calls and texts has become so huge, with seven out of ten people receiving them, that consumer watchdog Which? has launched a ‘Calling Time’ campaign asking the Government to get tough on organisations that harass people in their homes.

Richard Lloyd of Which? says: ‘Unwanted calls or texts are not just a nuisance, they can be intrusive and distressing.

'Many of us have been bombarded with spurious claims of PPI or injury compensation, and people are fed up with this nuisance and want to see action.

‘We want regulators to work together to police and punish those responsible. If they are unwilling or unable to enforce the rules, the Government should step in.’

But the award for the biggest pest of all goes to the email spammers. In the past year, I have received 3,125 junk emails - that’s despite using the highest possible security filters.

From the Nigerian scammers telling me I’ve inherited millions to Canadian pharmacies wanting to sell me Viagra, the emails arrived at a rate of nine a day.

What I can do to reduce the spam? Apparently, not a lot.

Internet security expert Sam Maccherola says: ‘Once your email address is publicly available online or on an illegal list, the genie cannot be put back in the bottle.’

And as with the junk text messages, opting to unsubscribe will only alert spammers to the fact your email address is active, and you’ll be targeted even more.

With my own Project Junk at an end, I will shortly be taking my ten giant bin bags full of leaflets and letters to the recycling centre - and, sadly, bracing myself for the even bigger deluge that 2014 is bound to bring.

There are ways to opt out of posted and telephone junk, but they are often not well-publicised or do not work
