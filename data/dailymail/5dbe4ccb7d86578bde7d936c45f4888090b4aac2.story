An Arab immigration officer whose colleagues claimed he looked at the Al Jazeera website too much at work was sacked over alleged links to Islamic terrorism, a tribunal heard.

The 44-year-old interpreter, who helped 
Special Branch interview terror suspects at Gatwick airport, had his security clearance 
removed in 2005, a month after returning from a year-long sabbatical in 
his native Yemen.

The tribunal heard how colleagues noticed that he accessed the Al Jazeera news website 'excessively' and became suspicious of him.

He was suspended on full pay for five years then sacked after the Home Office deemed him a risk to national security.

Now the officer, a naturalised British citizen, has attacked the Home Office for not allowing him to defend himself against the unspecified allegations and is suing his former employers for discrimination and unfair dismissal.

The father of three claims it was only 
because of his race and the fact that he is a Muslim that he was 
suspected of associating with terrorists.

His employment tribunal was covered by 
controversial ‘closed material procedures’, which allow cases to be 
heard almost entirely in private to stop sensitive intelligence being 
discussed in public.

Known only as ‘Mr W’, he has not been
told of the evidence against him as the Home Office argued it would 
risk national security.

The Daily Mail has led the criticism 
of the Government’s proposed ‘secret justice’ system, which will let 
judges approve ministers’ requests for closed hearings in all civil 
cases apart from inquests.

Mr W was told his security clearance 
was withdrawn from his estimated £28,000-a-year post because he had been
‘identified as an associate of a network of suspected Islamist 
extremists who were assessed to be supporting the insurgency in Iraq’.

The Home Office added that even an innocent link to such people would put Mr W in a ‘vulnerable position’.

Large parts of the hearing at the 
Central London Employment Tribunal have been held behind closed doors 
without Mr W, his legal team or the press and public allowed in court.

Instead of his chosen lawyer, he is 
represented by a special advocate –appointed by the Attorney-General – 
who has clearance to see the secret material but is forbidden from 
discussing the evidence with Mr W.

Due to the sensitivity of the 
material, the Home Office barristers did not ask Mr W anything under 
cross-examination and the department’s witnesses said four times during 
proceedings they could not answer questions put to them in open court.

Mr W joined the Home Office in 1999 – the same year he was granted British citizenship.

His last role before his suspension 
was as an assistant immigration officer at Gatwick Airport, in which 
capacity he could routinely check classified information and 
occasionally top-secret data.

Mr W, who was sacked in 2010 after an
external appeal found against him, said: ‘I was not told... of the 
identity or identities of the person with whom I am alleged to have 
associated. If I was told of such a person, I would have been able to 
explain such contact and prove my innocence, if indeed there was such 
contact.

‘Whilst in Yemen I met a number of 
people but I do not recall anyone who was fanatical or seemed of that 
type or who I thought was suspicious.

'None of my family in Yemen or the 
UK, immediate or extended, is remotely interested in politics or 
terrorism. I am certain of that.

‘While going about my normal 
business, for example attending a mosque, I suppose I may be 
statistically more likely to come into contact, without knowing it, with
a supporter of the insurgency in Iraq.

‘I consider myself loyal to the UK and to the Home Office.’

Mr W told the tribunal last week that
police had never interviewed him nor had security services asked him to
assist any investigations.

The Home Office denies discriminating against Mr W’s race and religion and is contesting his claim of unfair dismissal.

The tribunal has concluded and reserved judgment until a later date.
