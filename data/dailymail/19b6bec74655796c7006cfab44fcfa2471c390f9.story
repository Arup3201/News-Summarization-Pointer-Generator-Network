Art teacher Ashley Crane is a picture of beauty as a Miss England contestant, but her modelling career only came about after her rugby dream was cut short.

The 22-year-old self-confessed tomboy, who has just been crowned Miss Surrey, was tipped as a future star of the women's game until a serious shoulder injury forced her to quit.

The stunning 6ft blonde had dreamed of sporting fame after being discovered at university and even played in a Dubai 7s tournament.

After turning out for the first team at Loughborough University Ashley, pictured here playing rugby, was tipped to become one of the greats of the game

Following her shoulder injury on the pitch, friends persuaded a reluctant Ashley to compete for Miss Surrey and she was shocked to walk away with the crown

But last week Ashley, who now works as a teacher at St John's School in Leatherhead, Surrey, swapped her rugby boots for stilettos as she entered her first beauty pageant - and walked away with the Miss Surrey crown.

The title puts her in the running for the national Miss England contest next month - and if she wins that, she would be in the running for Miss World.

Ashley, from Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, said: 'It was weird because I was a tomboy and had my head in the game for so long. I thought I had lost my grace.

'I always had the same dress I would chuck on for special events and I'd do my hair. I'd never get glammed up but when you do pageants, you realise how important that is for a girl.

'I loved it from the beginning, you are with all the girls and they were all so chilled out.

'I was over the moon when they called my name at Miss Surrey. I just couldn't believe it. Now I am just buzzing for Miss England, I can't wait.

'There are a few obstacles before the competition - I just have to train well and get the right nutrition.'

Ashley started playing rugby when she was 17 - scoring two tries on her debut for a local team.

She picked up the sport at Loughborough University and was put into the first team, taking part in the Dubai 7s tournament in summer 2012 as part of a social team.

Her side reached the semi-finals where they were beaten by the Kazakhstani national side.

But it was Ashley's last tournament as she injured her right shoulder at trials for the Midlands.

She faced the choice of spending £6,000 on a private operation or two years on an NHS waiting list, so reluctantly gave up the game.

Ashley added: 'When I first started, my mum really didn't want me to play and I didn't realise I had the potential to be good.

'The Dubai 7s massively encouraged me to play professionally. I took so much pride in the fact I was good at what I was doing.

'You get bashed about a lot and you just deal with it. It is an old school mentality of just getting on with it.

'I basically took the tackle and I went down on my shoulder. I thought it was a dead arm at first but it was actually torn tissue.

'It is something that can be repaired with keyhole surgery. I didn't have the money or savings to drop in to and I didn't want to wait around for the surgery.

'The first two months were some of the hardest of my life but then I decided to put it all behind me.'

Friends persuaded a reluctant Ashley to take to the catwalk and she she was stunned when she was picked from more than 100 hopefuls to be named Miss Surrey.

If she wins the Miss England competition she could be set to win £25,000, a trip to Mauritius and a place in Miss World.
