Angel di Maria is well on his way to becoming a cult hero at Manchester United, but the £60million deal to take the Argentine to the Premier League reportedly only happened because Monaco cashed out.

French publication Le 10 Sport claim that the winger had an agreement with  Monaco before signing for Louis van Gaal's side.

The publication states that Di Maria was set on a move to the French big-spenders prior to the World Cup, only for money issues to scupper a deal.

Di Maria has made a flying start to life in England, scoring in his last two appearances as Van Gaal attempts to build a new team at Old Trafford.

His arrival was somewhat of a surprise due to his stellar performances with Real Madrid last season, though president Florentino Perez wanted to move on the 26-year-old to make room for incoming playmaker James Rodriguez.

Perez's preferred destination for Di Maria was reportedly Paris Saint-Germain, but the Ligue 1 champions pulled out because of Financial Fair Play regulations.

That left the midfielder, who is said to have had an 'agreement in principle' with Monaco in spring, with a move to Manchester United on the cards.

The Red Devils are certainly glad they took the gamble now.
