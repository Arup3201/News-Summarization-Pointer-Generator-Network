Will Man City beat West Ham to win the title?

Manuel Pellegrini has claimed he was always certain that Manchester City would go on to beat Aston Villa, despite a nervous first hour against the Villans.

Two goals from Edin Dzeko as well as late strikes from Stevan Jovetic and Yaya Toure helped City record a 4-0 win at the Etihad Stadium.

But City toiled in attack for long periods, and only scored the opening goal in the 64th minute following a stubborn defensive showing from Paul Lambert's outfit.

Pellegrini's team only had one shot on target in the first half, but the City boss claimed he was always confident his side would make the breakthrough by sticking to their guns.

'It was a big test because it was not an easy game, Pellegrini told Sky Sports. 'We now have to win at home if we want to continue what we can do in the future.

'The team played very well for 90 minutes and we were very patient in the first half. We were patient and prepared, it's not easy to play against 10 defenders but I spoke to the players at half-time and I told them to continue what we were doing.

'We were playing well. I was absolutely sure we would find space to score the goal.'

The result means Manchester City only need to beat West Ham on the final day of the season to win their second title in three years.

The scenario will bring back memories of the 2012 title race when Roberto Mancini's City team needed to beat QPR on the final day, eventually stumbling to the title thanks to two dramatic late goals against the Hoops.

However, Pellegrini denies having ever watched the game in an attempt to learn from past mistakes, and has no intention of viewing the match claiming the game contained a totally different City team.

'We are just thinking about the title, we must beat West Ham and win the title. I've not seen the game [QPR 2012], it was another team playing another way. QPR against Man City or Liverpool vs Palace, it doesnt matter. Any team can beat another team. It's all different.'
