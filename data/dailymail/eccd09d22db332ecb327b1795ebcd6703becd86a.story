Room without a view: The windows on this apartment block might look real from a distance, but they have been painted on to look real as a cost cutting measure

Anyone hoping to move into this high rise block of flats in eastern China probably shouldn't expect a room with view.

While the apartments may look like they have plenty of windows, many of them are fake.

Officials in Qingdao, in Shandong province, have claimed that a series of 'windows' have been pianted onto the side of the low cost accommodation for aesthetic reasons rather than to fool potential buyers.

According to reports, the appearance of the block sparked internet rumours that the Government was cutting corners in a bid to save money.

Others asked whether the construction company hired to build the Government-subsided accommodation had cheated officials in order to increase its profits.

But local officials said that the windows are just there for decoration and that the block conforms to building regulations.

They added that the windows are only painted on to a part of the building which houses elevator shafts.

It is not immediately clear, but fortunately for residents there are proper windows on the other side of the building.

According to reports, the Qingdao municipal government claimed on its official Weibo account Wednesday night that they had ordered the construction company to rectify the ornamental windows, which have been 'misunderstood' and caused an 'adverse social effect.'

Until then, perhaps residents of the building can take solace in the fact that they will save money on their window cleaning bill.

It is hardly surprising that Chinese authorities are cutting the odd corner.

According to reports, new home prices across the country rose by 8.3 per cent in August and authorities have been trying to cool down persistently high property prices in recent years.

Perhaps creating homes with fake windows is their latest ploy.
