Authorities say former NFL quarterback Max Hall has been accused of shoplifting and narcotics possession near his Arizona hometown.

Gilbert police say the 28-year-old Hall, who played for the Arizona Cardinals before being dropped after the 2010 season, was arrested Friday for allegedly shoplifting from a Best Buy store in Gilbert.

The ex-Brigham Young University quarterback was wearing his BYU jersey when he was arrested and found to have needles, a metal spoon, a lighter and a pill bottle filled with cocaine on his person as well as several items stolen from the Best Buy and a nearby Walmart.

The Mormon university, which aims to 'assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life,' requires that students abstain from drugs, alcohol and tobacco, among other things.

'I'm really sorry, I'll pay for the stuff. If I get arrested, I'll get fired. I've never done this before,' Hall is quoted as saying in the arrest report.

Officers say they searched Hall's backpack and found several stolen items including cell phone cases and phone chargers along with a 'personal-use quantity of cocaine.'

According to the Deseret News, he told police that he had injected himself with cocaine that morning.

Police say Hall was released shortly after his arrest. It was unclear Tuesday if he has obtained a lawyer. 

Hall, who grew up in Mesa, played college football at Arizona State and BYU before being signed as an undrafted free agent by the Arizona Cardinals.

'Max Hall in many ways epitomized growing up as a young boy, what you want to become,' said broadcaster said Kevin Ray.

He played in six games for the Cardinals in 2010 and then played with the Canadian Football League's Winnipeg Blue Bombers in 2013.

In 2012, he worked as an assistant coach for Brigham Young University. 

He is the married father of two young children. 

News of the arrest stunned BYU fans and the wider football community, which took to social media to express their shock and sadness, although others were less sympathetic.

'No secret I'm not a BYU fan but Max Hall's situation is beyond any rivalry. Always was a good guy to me. Hope he gets out of this dark place,' wrote Chargers' quarterback Ryan Lindley.

'Relax, cougar fans. The coke max hall was busted with was caffeine free [sic],' tweeted one BYU graduate.
