The discovery of two human fingers, a butcher's knife and a bloody chopping board in a children's playground led police to uncover an insurance scam.

The grim find was made by an off-duty policeman in the Catalan city of Girona and he called police thinking he had unearthed evidence of an attack.

But Mossos d'Esquadra police later made the connection between a man who had been admitted to a nearby hospital only the day before for reportedly chopping two of his fingers off in a cooking accident and the gruesome discovery in the playground.

The discovery of two human fingers, a butcher's knife and a bloody chopping board in a children's playground led police to uncover an insurance scam

They discovered that the Pakistani man had taken out six accident policies with different insurance companies, granting him more than €122,000 ($168,000) in total in case he did suffer an injury.

Doctors had attempted to stitch the missing digits back on to the man’s hand but too much time had passed for the procedure to be successful, reports French English language website The Local.

The man had in fact already carried out a very similar scam successfully the year before, after he swindled two insurers out of €24,000 for injuries to his other hand.

The man, who has no prior criminal record, was released on charges on 4 April.
