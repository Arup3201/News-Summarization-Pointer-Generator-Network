A California man who groped two female passengers and a retired airline employee aboard a US Airways flight in May has pleaded guilty to charges of interfering with a flight crew.

Robert Coppack, 41, appeared in federal court in Philadelphia Wednesday, admitting that he was extremely drunk and acted inappropriately at the time of the incident, which caused the London-bound flight to be diverted back to Philadelphia.

A somber Mr Coppack told Judge John Padova in court that he has a history of mental illness and drug addiction. He now takes medications for depression.

Confession: Robert Coppack, 41, pleaded guilty to interfering with a flight crew in connection to a May 13 incident involving groping aboard a Philadelphia-to-London US Airways flight

Offloaded: Robert John Coppack was moved to the rear of the plane, where he was restrained until the aircraft returned to Philadelphia and taken away. He is now in custody

Prosecutor Sarah Grieb said it all 
started when Coppack struck up a conversation with an 18-year-old 
college student sitting next to him aboard US Airways Flight 728 on the 
evening of May 13, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.

The
 California man confided in the young woman that the bottle of Gatorade 
he's been sipping from actually contained alcohol, which she could smell of
 his breath. He then started touching her arms and knees.

Coppack
 continued palming at the teen, who was traveling to the UK as part of a
 college program, even after she told him to stop.

Coppack
 admitted that he poked another woman across the aisle in the arm and 
fondled the breasts of a third passenger after he was asked to move 
seats.

The 41-year-old 
man agreed to pay a fine and restitution to US Airways, which will likely amount to several hundred thousand dollars.  

Coppack is set to be sentenced December 16. He could face up to 20 years in prison.

Troubled: Coppack told a judge he has a history of mental illness, and that he has been taking medication for depression

According
 to an FBI affidavit from May, two women sitting with Coppack complained
 about his behavior on a red-eye US Airways flight May 13, prompting
 the crew to escort him to the back of the plane.

Coppack then groped a retired flight attendant as he walked down the aisle, the affidavit said.

Coppack, who told his seatmates he had been drinking vodka, was also aggressive and verbally abusive, the affidavit said.

He was detained on board by an air marshal on the flight, and later charged with intimidating the crew and interfering with their work.

Uneasy: California resident touched two female passengers 'inappropriately;' the women told flight attendants that they didn't feel comfortable sitting next to him

Flight attendants sent him to the back of the plane, and that’s where federal air marshals met him. 

But the incident was not quite over.  The allegation is that he threatened physical assault on the marshal.

The plane arrived at Heathrow Airport in London about four hours late, airline spokeswoman Michelle Mohr said.

Coppack was traveling on a British passport, and told officials he has dual citizenship, the affidavit said.
