Stone Roses frontman Ian Brown has claimed that TV weatherman and former biology teacher Fred Talbot played his class gay porn when he was 11.

The 51-year-old singer was taught by Talbot at Altrincham Grammar School in Manchester in the late 1970s and also told a court that he gave masturbation practice as homework. 

Talbot, 65, denies 10 offences of indecent assault on five boys while working as a teacher between the late 1960s and the early 1980s and is on trial at Minshull Street Crown Court in Manchester.

Wearing trainers, jeans and an open-necked shirt, Mr Brown said the all-boys grammar school was a violent place - but Talbot was one of the few teachers who did not physically hurt pupils.

He told the court he remembered 'in particular' two or three biology lessons given by Talbot when he was an 11-year-old boy.

'Very early at school, I would not have been there a long time, Mr Talbot asked all the class if any of us had ever masturbated,' he said. 'We were 11 years old at the time.'

Mr Brown continued: 'He went on to explain how to masturbate, how you should masturbate and the following lesson he asked who had masturbated.'

Neil Usher, prosecuting, asked if there was any response from the boys.

'Nervous giggles,' Mr Brown said. 'He wanted to know who was successful in the masturbation. He asked boys to raise the hand.'

Mr Brown said in further biology lessons, Talbot would approach the boys who had raised their hands - the ones with 'bum fluff on their lips' - and have 'private words' and 'murmuring' in their ears.

The witness continued: 'I can remember sitting there wondering, "What is he saying to them?"'

'They were all the same age but they were a foot bigger than us.'

Mr Brown, who attended the school between 1974 and 1979, then told the jury of a second memorable biology lesson with Talbot.

He said the class went to the science block, but instead of the usual classroom went into another with a projector set up to show the class of 11-year-olds a film.

Mr Brown said: 'A three minute film on a Super 8 projector, of a guy walking into a room dressed in denims, sits on bed, takes trousers down and masturbates.

'The film was about three minutes long. It was only a few years later I realised it was probably a gay porn film. It wasn't a sex education film. 

'It was years later I realised it was wrong to show us that film.'

Mr Usher asked how old the witness was at the time and the lead singer of the Manchester band, the Stone Roses, replied: 'Around 11. About the time you would have had sex education in school.'

Mr Brown gave further evidence, much of which cannot be reported for legal reasons. 

Talbot became a TV regular on the floating weather map in Liverpool's Albert Dock for ITV's This Morning show after his teaching career had come to an 'abrupt end' in 1984.

The jury heard he resigned his school job after allegedly propositioning a pupil at his home and the headmaster was informed.

But the court was told Talbot was a 'chancer' who used his 'boundless energy' and 'extrovert personality' to abuse some of the boys he taught, four of them teenage pupils.

Talbot, of Bowdon, Cheshire, denies ten indecent assaults on boys as young as 14, dating back to 1969.

The trial continues.
