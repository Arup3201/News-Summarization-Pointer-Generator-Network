Two black teenagers accused of killing a World War II veteran have been placed in protective custody after neo-Nazis put a $10,000 bounty on them.

Kenan Adams-Kinard and Demetruis Glenn, from Spokane, Washington, allegedly beat Delbert Belton, 88, who fought in the Battle of Okinawa, to death during a robbery.

The white supremacist prison gang the Aryan Brotherhood are believed to have offered a reward to anyone who could kill the 16-year-olds while they await trial.

Court 
documents, seen by the Spokesman-Review, indicate that one of the pair was placed in protective custody
 rather than juvenile detention over fears of reprisal attacks.

Sergeant Tom Hill, of Spokane Police, told Spokane County Superior Court that he had information about the bounty.

District
 Court Judge Debra Hayes said she allowed them to stay out of adult 
prison to avoid possible 'tragic results' if they had been moved through
 an open courtyard, the newspaper said.

Both teens deny murder and their trial is scheduled for March 17.

They are being held in the Spokane County Jail.

The pair are accused of beating Belton to death with flashlights outside an Eagles Lodge on August 22 and they could face life in prison if convicted.

The elderly man was found dead and wedged between the two front seats of his car. 

Adams-Kinard's attorney objected to him being placed in adult prison

Investigators
 allegedly found Glenn's prints on the outside of the car and the inside
 of the passenger door behind the driver's seat, according to Fox News.

Prints
 said to belong to Adams-Kinard were found on the outside of the 
driver's door and inside of the back passenger door, the affidavit said.

The
 teenagers face charges of first-degree murder and two charges of 
first-degree robbery.

A
 letter found at the home where Adams-Kinard was arrested said they 
punched Belton three times before taking his wallet and drugs from his 
pockets, authorities said.

The
 letter indicated Adams-Kinard had called Belton and arranged to buy 
crack cocaine.

However, police have said there was no evidence that 
Belton was a drug dealer.

Glenn,
 who turned himself in, was being held in lieu of $2 million bail.

Adams-Kinard, who is suspected of hiding 
from police after the slaying, is jailed on $3 million bail.

Adams-Kinard
 and Demetrius Glenn both have previous convictions for assault and were
 caught on security cameras at the time of the killing.

Glenn
 gave himself up immediately to the police, but Adams-Kinard went on the
 run for four days and allegedly told friends during his time in hiding 
that the beating occurred because of a drug deal gone wrong.

The letter said that after purchasing a 'zip of crack cocaine from Shorty,' the teens 'proceeded to sock him'.

'I
 took his wallet and another ounce of crack from his pockets,' the 
letter said, according to the court document. 'He was unconscious so I 
made sure he was still breathing, and then I took off.'

Police
 have said that they seriously doubt Adams-Kinard's story and spokesman,
 Monique Cotton said in a statement: 'We have no evidence to support 
that.'

Belton was born in Sunnyside and raised in Spokane. He got his nickname as an adult for being just over 5 feet tall.

When
 he was buried last week hundreds gathered at Greenwood Memorial Terrace
 on August 30 to bid farewell to Mr Belton.

Uniformed
 soldiers joined the mourners and the Rev Homer Todd told how Mr Belton 
had fought bravely and was shot in the leg in the Battle of Okinawa.

After the war, he spent 33 years working for Kaiser Aluminum before retiring in 1982.

According
 to NBC, at the funeral he was described 'as a man who was short of 
stature but full of life and generosity, a tinkerer who loved souping up
 cars in his project-cluttered garage, and an "agile" dancer who needed 
no coaxing to get out on the floor.'

Rev
 Todd said: 'There are a lot of gals that will miss having a partner at 
those events. He was short, but full of vim and vinegar.'
