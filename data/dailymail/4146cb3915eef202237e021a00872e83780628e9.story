David Cameron has launched an extraordinary attack on rebel MP Mark Reckless for defecting to UKIP, accusing him of betraying activists who worked to get his ‘fat arse’ on the Commons benches.

The Prime Minister is furious at the Rochester MP’s decision to leave the Tory party, and has used speeches at the Tory party conference to vow to personally lead the fight to defeat him in the forthcoming by-election.

And he insisted he cared 1,000 times more about Scotland remaining in the UK than he did about whether Britain left the European Union, insisting he only wanted to act in the national interest.

Prime Minister David Cameron has branded UKIP defector Mark Reckless a 'fat arse' who has betrayed the hard work of Tory activists

The Tory party conference has been rocked by the defections of Mr Reckless and Douglas Carswell to UKIP.

The moves have threatened to overshadow the Conservative leadership’s planned focus on the economy.

While Mr Cameron is resigned to the fact that Mr Carswell, a long-standing Eurosceptic MP, will win the by-election in Clacton, he is furious at Mr Reckless’ ‘betrayal’.

Speaking at several parties and receptions held around the conference in Birmingham, Mr Cameron has become increasingly animated about the way Mr Reckless relied on the support of Conservative activists to get elected.

The Prime Minister argues that committed volunteers have ‘knocked on doors, stuffed envelopes, licked stamps to get his fat arse on the Commons benches, and this is how he repays them’.

At another event Mr Cameron is said to have claimed that if Mr Reckless 'got off his fat arse and worked harder he wouldn't have to defect to UKIP to save his skin'.

The Tory party is expected to mount a huge effort to hold the seat, with local activists lining up to criticise Mr Reckless’ decision to change parties.

Mr Cameron has promised to renegotiate a new deal with the EU, clawing back powers from Brussels, before holding an in-out referendum in 2017.

Under pressure from Eurosceptics, Mr Cameron has made clear he will not argue for Britain to remain in the EU if it is not in the national interest.

London Mayor Boris Johnson last night launched an extraordinary attack on Tories who have defected to UKIP, claiming they were the sort of people who injure themselves having sex with vacuum cleaners

In an interview this morning, the Prime Minister made clear he holds no love for the EU institution.

During the campaign on Scottish independence, Mr Cameron said he would be ‘heartbroken’ if the UK had been broken up.

Today he revealed: ‘I feel about a thousand times more strongly about our United Kingdom than I do about the European Union.

‘If I didn’t think it was in Britain’s interest to be in the EU, I wouldn’t argue for it. I think the best answer for Britain is a reformed position in the EU because we’re a trading nation, we don’t just want access to those markets, we want a say over the rules. But let’s be frank, it’s not working properly for us at the moment.

‘The single currency has driven process of change that has alienated in people in Europe.’

In an apparent admission of the scale of the challenge, Mr Reckless yesterday confessed that he could lose his seat and become 'a footnote in history'.

He has faced an onslaught of criticism from his former Conservative party colleagues since his defection, with some openly accusing him of lying about his plans to defect.

Today it emerged a former deputy to London Mayor Boris Johnson has also defected to UKIP.

Richard Barnes told the Standard that the Tories, Labour and Lib Dems did not “speak the language of normal people”.

Douglas Carswell became the first Conservative to defect to UKIP last month, sparking speculation that up to eight MPs were considering leaving the party

Mr Johnson last night launched an extraordinary attack on Tories who have defected to UKIP, claiming they were the sort of people who injure themselves having sex with vacuum cleaners.

Mr Johnson vowed to take on the 'quitters, the splitters, the kippers' who are trying to undermine the Tory party.

And he mocked defectors with an extraordinary sex joke. He told delighted Tory activists:'The EU commission wants to ban vacuum cleaners on the grounds that they are too powerful.

‘If you do not handle your vacuum cleaner correctly, you may end up inhaling the hamster – the budgerigar through the bars of the cage.

‘And I have read that there are some people – probably the type who are thinking of defecting to UKIP – who present themselves at A&E with barely credible injuries sustained through vacuum cleaner abuse.’

He suggested that UKIP leader Nigel Farage should switch to become a Conservative.

Mr Cameron today also urged Tories not to follow the defectors. He told ITV’s Good Morning Britain: ‘The point is there's no need for anyone to defect, because if you want an in-out referendum on Europe, if you want action on immigration, if you want further reform of our welfare system, if you want to keep our economy growing, the only way to get that is to have a Conservative government.

‘If you vote for UKIP, you’re more than likely to end up with Ed Miliband No 10 Downing Street and Ed Balls in the Treasury, repeating all the mistakes they made in the past and not giving you a choice over Europe.

‘So it’s a very straight choice at the next election, and I think the feeling at this conference is of a team coming together rot serve our country and put forward a very clear long-term economic plan f or how we can deliver in that country in the years ahead.’
