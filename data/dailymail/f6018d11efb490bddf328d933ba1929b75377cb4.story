A gay activist carrying a bag of Chick-fil-A items opened fire in the headquarters of a conservative lobbying unit, wounding a security guard, police said.

At approximately 10.45 a.m. the man, identified as 28-year-old Floyd Corkins II, walked into the Family Research Council's (FRC) headquarters in Washington, DC's Chinatown area, made a statement, produced a gun and then shot a security guard who tried to stop him.

Corkins had been volunteering at a community center dedicated to gay, lesbian and transgendered people.

The guard was rushed to hospital while witnesses said that when the man was disarmed, the suspect said, 'Don't shoot me, it was not about you, it was what this place stands for.'

Under arrest: Police say Floyd Corkins II, walked into the Family Research Council's headquarters in Washington, DC's Chinatown area with Chick-fil-A items and shot a guard

Local and federal investigators work to gather evidence after a security guard was shot in the arm at the headquarters of the Family Research Council August 15, 2012 in Washington, DC.

David Mariner, the executive director of The DC Center for the LGBT Community, confirmed Corkins had been volunteering at the center for about the past 6 months.

Mariner described Corkins as 'kind, gentle and unassuming.'

While police have not yet stated what motivated Corkins, a coalition of 25 gay rights groups released a statement through GLAAD condemning the shooting.

'The motivation and circumstances behind today's tragedy are still unknown, but regardless of what emerges as the reason for this shooting, we utterly reject and condemn such violence.

'We wish for a swift and complete recovery for the victim of this terrible incident,' the statement read.'

The Family Research Council is a 
right-wing, conservative lobbying organisation that is against abortion,
 euthanasia and same-sex marriages.

'The
 police are investigating this incident,' said FRC President Tony 
Perkins in a statement. 'Our first concern is with our colleague who was
 shot today. Our concern is for him and his family.'

The council was also recently in the news when Mr. Perkins defended Chick-fil-A chief executive Dan Cathy's public comments that were perceived as critical of gay marriage.

Cathy, the president of the 
multimillion-dollar empire said in an interview with the conservative 
paper Baptist Press last month that his company is ‘very much supportive
 of the family,’ but only when it involves heterosexual couples.

'Well, guilty as charged,' Cathy 
responded when asked about Chick-fil-A’s backing of ‘traditional’ 
families with a husband and wife.

His comments sparked outrage among gay and lesbian groups across the country, with many holding protests and 'kiss-ins' at Chick-fil-A restaurants.

Perkins later spoke out in support of Cathy, saying: 'All 
Chick-fil-A did was refuse to be bullied by the politically correct 
crowd.'

The former president of the Family Research Council and former
 Republican presidential candidate, Gary Bauer also said at the time: 'The values of the Family 
Research Council - pro-life and pro-family - are shared by millions of 
Americans of many backgrounds, and should not make anyone a target of 
violence.'

Sources have 
told NBC 4's Jackie Bensen that the gunman had two 15 round ammunition 
clips with him and was carrying Chick-fil-A sandwiches in his backpack 
too.

'He opened fire on the security guard,' said MPD Police Chief Cathy Lanier.

'The
 security guard was struck, is right now receiving treatment and is in 
stable condition. The security guard and others wrestled the suspect 
down to the ground and he is in custody.'

It is thought that the security guard was shot in the arm and was conscious and breathing when he was taken to hospital.

'The security guard here is a hero, as far as I’m concerned,' said Chief Lanier.

'He did his job. The person never made it past the front.'

According to Fox News, the suspect 'made statements regarding their policies and then opened fire with a gun striking a security guard.'

As they began their investigation, federal authorities began treating the incident as a case of domestic terrorism.

'We don't know enough about him or 
his circumstances to determine what his connection is to this group, 
(The FRC) or his mental state, or what he was doing or thinking of 
doing,' said James McJunkin, the head of the FBI's Washington Field 
Office.

Mitt Romney made a statement after hearing of the gunman entering the building.

'I am appalled by the shooting today at the offices of the Family Research Council in our nation’s capital,' he said.

'There
 is no place for such violence in our society. My prayers go out to the 
wounded security guard and his family, as well as all the people at the 
Family Research Council whose sense of security has been shattered by 
today’s horrific events.'

'So we're going to try to sort this all out, pull the evidence together, do all the interviews we can.'

The shooting took place at the Family Research Council's 801 G Street headquarters and in the aftermath of the shooting the suspect was brought in by the FBI for questioning.

Authorities have not released to the public information about the type of weapon the suspect was using, or if the security guard was armed.
