Stunned motorists slammed on their brakes when a high voltage power cable snapped and landed on a passing motorcyclist - causing him to instantly burst into flames.

The incident happened on a main road running through Wuning county in southern China's Jiangxi province when the biker Shaiming Liang, 33, was hit on the head by the falling cable.

His body instantly burst into flames and then the bike exploded, killing him in the process.

Horrific: The motorcyclist died after a high voltage power cable snapped and landed on a passing motorcyclist - wrapping around his neck and causing him to  burst into flames

Eyewitness Gang Shih, 27, said: 'It was horrible. I heard a bang and someone scream, and when I looked I saw smoke coming from a crash scene. 

'At first I didn't realise that the crash was just one person. But then I saw it was just a bike and no other vehicles, and that a high voltage cable had fallen on the driver.

'The smoke was coming from the man, if was as if pouring out from his body and then he burst into flames. I'll never forget the sight...it's burned into my memory.'

After the main electricity pylon running along the road was eventually switched off, firemen were able remove Mr Shaiming's body from the burned wreck of his vehicle.

Pictures of the scene show the cable had wrapped itself round his neck as he was driving past, and had burned itself into his neck as soon as he had touched it.

Details of the crash came as it emerged two Chinese street cleaners have been killed and three others left with serious injuries after they were mown down by a car in Xining, Qinghai Province.

The tragedy happened when a white Ford driven by a 53-year-old man named Ye Kung suddenly swerved and collided with a car coming in the opposite direction. 

The force of the collision had sent the white car back across the road where it ploughed into the group of five sanitation workers as they were attempting to remove litter from a blocked drain.

Emergency services rushed to the incident that happened on a road leading into the city of Xining in north-western China's Qinghai Province but were too late to help one of the workers who was declared dead at the scene. A second man died on the way to hospital and three others were all hospitalised with serious injuries.
