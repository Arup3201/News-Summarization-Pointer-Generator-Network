A painting by LS Lowry that has not been seen in public for a generation was sold last night for £2.3million.

Station Approach, Manchester was snapped up by a mystery telephone bidder at Sotheby’s in London.

The 1960 oil painting of Manchester Exchange railway station, which closed in 1969, now ranks in the artist’s top ten most expensive works ever sold at auction.

'Lowry at his very best': The 1960 oil painting of Manchester Exchange railway station, which closed in 1969, now ranks in the LS Lowry's top ten most expensive works ever sold at auction

The painting depicts workers heading to the London and North Western Railway Station, which was built in 1884, and crowds swelling around a large sculpture of Oliver Cromwell. 

Lowry produced a smaller version on the painting in 1962 to present to the Royal Academy of Arts on being made a Royal Academician. 

Frances Christie, Sotheby’s head of modern and post-war British art, said the painting was one of the most exciting Lowry works to emerge on the market in recent years.

She added: ‘Lowry was a master at portraying the energy and vitality of everyday life and in Station Approach, Manchester he captures the hustle and bustle of the crowds heading home after a hard day’s work – it is a superb example of Lowry at his very best.’

Lowry, who lived in Greater Manchester, was famous for his paintings of matchstick men and industrial landscapes.
