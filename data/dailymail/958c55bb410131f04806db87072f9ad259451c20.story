A manhunt has been launched after a psychiatric patient assaulted two members of hospital staff before attacking a driver and escaping in his car.

Paul Williams, 48, absconded from a hospital on Stadium Road in Woolwich, southeast London, at 11.45am today and then burgled a home less than a mile away.

He is believed to be a danger to the public and police are warning people not to approach him.

He speaks with an American accent.

The psychiatric patient was last seen near Woolwich Arsenal station at 1.40pm.

The car he used to escape the hospital has since been abandoned. 

A police operation to find Williams continues, led by officers from Greenwich and supported by colleagues from the Specialist Crime & Operations Command.

The burglary took place at Caldwell Close, also in Woolwich. 

Any sightings of Williams should be reported to the police on 999 quoting reference 14mis042920.
