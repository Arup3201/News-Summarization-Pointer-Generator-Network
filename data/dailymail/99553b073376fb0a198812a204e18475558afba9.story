A hitchhiker travelled thousands of miles around America - by catching lifts with women he met on a dating app.

Daniel Beaumont, of Kendal, Cumbria, turned to Tinder in a bid to speed up his epic journey - after despairing of being overlooked for lifts on the side of the road.

In total, he charmed 32 women into giving him a lift on his 7,500 mile adventure from the west coast of Canada back to New York.

Audacious: Daniel Beaumont, of Kendal, Cumbria hitchhiked across America with women he found on Tinder

The 24-year-old had set off on his hitchhiking trip across the US in May this year to attend a wedding in British Columbia.

But he soon became tired of being rejected by drivers as he thumbed for lifts, often in dismal conditions, and the first leg from east to west took him three months.

He then decided to hijack Tinder, which uses GPS to match people locally, in an attempt to find his way back from Vancouver.

Mr Beaumont admitted there was 'some romance' during the journey that followed - but declined to expand further.

On Tinder, he changed his profile to describe himself as a 'Nomadic traveler of 2 years from Britain. Currently hitchhiking 12,000 miles across North America.'

He wrote: 'Trying to get by through the generosity of wonderful people. Need to reach New York City by early November. Can you help me get there?' 

As an opening line, he said, he would make an observation about their Tinder profile, 'but if not usually something blunt and straight to the point – "Can you drive me 60km south?”'

The business graduate also used CouchSurfing, which allows members to 'surf' on couches by staying as a guest at a host's home, and said he also met people willing to help him out on the classified advertisements website Craigslist. 

He told MailOnline: 'Tinder has this reputation as a pick-up site, but I was trying to use it in an alternative way.

'I made my choices of possible match quite broad. I wasn’t necessarily looking for dates so I had opted for quite a broad age range, looking for women aged between 18 and 50 who were located within five miles of me.'

The first woman he met from Tinder, Steph, was able to help him travel from Edmonton in Alberta, Canada to Banff National Park - a four-hour drive to the south.

Speaking after his return to Britain, he said: 'I am still friends with most of the people I met and me and Steph still talk' (Pictured together above)

During the adventure, he used Tinder to arrange a tour around Hollywood in Los Angeles, a trip to the Grand Canyon and a camping trip on the West Coast of USA (Pictured above in San Francisco) 

'That was the realisation that I could use this to get across America,' he said.

He 'matched' with 3,766 people on Tinder in just three months in America but said in a blog that the arrangement 'wasn't just a one-way street.'

'I would cook for girls, adventure with them, make them laugh, and inspire many to change some part of their life, big or small,' he said.
