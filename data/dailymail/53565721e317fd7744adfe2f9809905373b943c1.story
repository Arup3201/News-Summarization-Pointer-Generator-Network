War memorials defaced with Islamic slogans were being cleaned up today with the veterans’ charity footing the bill.

The two monuments were targeted in London as police forces across the country dealt with a spate of ugly attacks fuelled by hatred after soldier Lee Rigby’s murder.

The newly erected tribute to the bomber pilots of World War II was one of two central London war memorials defaced by vandals on Monday. The other was the Animals in War memorial.

The clean-up begins: A contractor removes Islam graffiti which was daubed on a memorials to members of RAF Bomber Command after a spate of ugly attacks in the wake of soldier Lee Rigby's murder

Making good: At the Bomber Command monument, two contractors worked for over an hour removing the metre-high bright red letters spelling 'Islam'

Police are yet to make arrests over 
the vandalism, which was today cleaned by workmen using high pressure 
steam and solvent dispersing chemicals.

At
the Bomber Command monument, two contractors worked for over an hour 
removing the metre high bright red letters spelling 'Islam', which were 
scrawled underneath the Bomber Command’s crest, which reads 'Bomber 
Command Royal Airforce, Strike Hard Strike Sure.'

The graffiti comes in the wake of the murder of soldier Lee Rigby.

Head
of facilities at the RAF Benevolent Fund Gary Ross said the 
organisation was saddened by the vandalism, especially given the charity
now had to pay for its removal.

No respect: The vandals also sprayed paint over a poignant message giving details about the monument

'We are obviously very upset by 
anybody defacing what is a piece of history now. We have had calls 
through from veterans about it, obviously they’re very disturbed by the 
whole situation and now we have to pay for its removal,' Mr Ross said.

'We are the RAFs leading welfare charity, supporting serving and ex-service personal.

'We
provide things like wheelchairs and motor scooters, we help with cost 
of living for service and ex service personal going through hard times, 
respite care, even helping with housing.

'It’s
taking money away from a charity which in this economic climate we 
could do without but it’s our responsibility to keep the memorial in 
good order.'

In London, hundreds of police in riot 
gear fought to calm a volatile clash between the English Defence :League
and anti-fascists yesterday.

Tourists
looked on in horror as hundreds of shaven-headed men carrying St 
George’s Cross flags chanted 'there’s only one Lee Rigby'.

Investigation: Police are yet to make arrests over the vandalism which came in the wake of the murder of soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich

Message: This image shows the word 'Islam' daubed on the Animals In War Memorial, but police are not sure if it was carried out by Muslim protesters or far-right groups trying to stir up trouble

Up to 1,000 EDL supporters chanted ‘no surrender’ and held pictures of a bloody meat cleaver as they marched past Downing Street

Meanwhile, two men have been remanded in custody to appear before a crown court judge after a mosque was petrol-bombed, court officials said today.

Grimsby Islamic Cultural Centre was attacked for the second time in three days on Sunday while a young family was inside.

Stuart Harness, 33, and Gavin Humphries, 37, both of Grimsby, were arrested in connection with the incident and appeared at the town’s magistrates’ court today.

They are charged with arson with intent to endanger life and were denied bail, a magistrates’ court official said.

No pleas were entered and the case will be sent to Grimsby Crown Court where it will be heard on June 7, the court official added.

The petrol-bombing was the second time the centre on Weelsby Road has been targeted since Drummer Lee Rigby was killed in Woolwich last week.

Eleven teenagers, aged 16 and 17, were arrested after a party spiralled out of control on Thursday.

Chief superintendent Tony Forbes, of Humberside Police, said: 'It is important to remember that those people who have committed these offences are a very small minority and they do not reflect the vast majority of people who live in North East Lincolnshire.'

In stark contrast to the violence and vandalism that has dogged the country in recent days, dozens of 
strangers continued to leave floral tributes and poignant messages to Lee Rigby today.

Members of the public braved the rain to add to the growing pile of flowers, teddy bears, poems left at 
the scene where the father-of-one was hacked to death in Woolwich last week.

Many of the tributes came from veterans, fellow servicemen and women and their families.

Meanwhile, a town in County Durham stood still this morning as army veterans held a memorial service for Drummer Rigby.

The service, led by the Sedgefield Veterans, took place outside St Edmunds Church where a flag was lowered to half mast.

The group holds a service for every serving solider who dies on duty. 

Over the Bank Holiday weekend, Drummer Rigby's widow made a tearful pilgrimage to the scene of his death the day after his fiancee made the same heartbreaking trip.

Rebecca Rigby, the mother of the 
soldier’s two-year-old son Jack, laid a wreath amid hundreds of other 
floral tributes to her estranged husband.

She
wrote on the card: ‘My hero, my soldier, my one true love. Until we 
meet again my angel I know you’ll be watching over me and Jack. Love 
always xxx.’

Another card tucked inside the wreath read: ‘For my daddy.’

Mrs Rigby, 30, sobbed and cradled a pink Peppa Pig soft toy as she pinned a balloon with the words ‘Dad in a million’ close to the spot in Woolwich where 25-year-old Drummer Rigby was butchered by two Islamic fanatics on Wednesday.

Drummer Rigby had survived Taliban bombs and bullets during a tour of duty as a machine gunner in Afghanistan, only to be slaughtered on the streets of London.

It is understood that he had separated from his wife, and started a relationship with army colleague Aimee West.

Miss West, 22, was flown back from Helmand where she was serving with the Royal Military Police.

On Saturday, she wept as she set down a bouquet of roses at the scene of his murder.

The name of murdered soldier Lee Rigby will be inscribed on a national memorial honouring Britain’s fallen servicemen and women.

Trustees for the Armed Forces Memorial at the National Memorial Arboretum, Staffordshire, said Drummer Rigby’s name would be included as he had died in a terrorist attack.

Drummer Rigby, 25, who had been serving with the 2nd Battalion the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, was killed in a knife attack carried out in broad daylight in Woolwich, London, last Wednesday.

In a statement, the memorial trustees said: 'Lee Rigby was killed as a result of terrorist action outside Woolwich Barracks in London on May 22 and qualifies for inclusion on the ArmedForces Memorial.

'His name, along with other members of the UK armed forces who are killed on duty or through terrorist action in 2013, will be engraved in time for the annual service of dedication in mid-2014.

'The families of the bereaved are always invited to attend, usually in the presence of a member of the Royal Family, a defence minister and senior armed forces representatives.'

The memorial honours all members of the UK’s armed forces who have died in conflicts or as a result of terrorist attacks since the end of the Second World War.
