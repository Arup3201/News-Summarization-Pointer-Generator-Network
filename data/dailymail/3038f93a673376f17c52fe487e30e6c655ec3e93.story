Amir Khan believes he is well placed to fight Floyd Mayweather Jnr - should a bout between the American and Manny Pacquiao fail to materialise.

A mega-money fight between Mayweather and Pacquiao appears to be edging closer after the pair met at the half-time interval of the Miami Heat vs Milwaukee Bucks NBA game on Tuesday and then later in a hotel.

But Khan is more than happy to step in and fight Mayweather if the pair fail to agree terms - insisting he has earned his shot.

Khan told Sky Sports News HQ: 'If that fight falls through, I think I have to be the next fighter to face Mayweather because I've proven myself in many ways.

'Mayweather wanted me to prove myself at 147lbs which I did by beating Luis Collazo and then by moving up and beating Devon Alexander - two top guys in the welterweight division who were both coming off good wins.

'The fight between me and him would be much easier to make than the Pacquiao fight because we have the same manager and the same promotions team, so why not get it done?' 

The Bolton fighter was speaking in his hometown as an impressive new portrait of him was unveiled at Bolton Art Gallery.

Christian Hook, 43, was recognised as the Sky Arts Portrait Artist of the Year 2014 for producing the painting.
