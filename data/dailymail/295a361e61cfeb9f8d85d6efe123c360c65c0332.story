A £1.5million house caught fire after the sun's rays bounced off a decorative doorknob and onto a dressing gown.

The strong sun was refracted through a crystal doorknob in the house in Clapham, south London, and onto a robe hanging from a wooden door which then caught fire.

Two fire engines raced to the scene in the expensive street near Clapham Common after builders working on the house next door heard the smoke alarm going off and dialled 999.

Fire broke out in a £1.5million house in south London after the sun was refracted through a crystal doorknob

Result: The bedroom was badly damaged after the fire which started in Clapham early on Monday morning

Fire risk: The doorknob on the other side of the burnt door shows what the original one looked like

The house was empty at the time but the bedroom was left badly damaged by the blaze, sparked early on Monday morning before the sun was even at its peak.

Scaffolder Peter Graham, 39, and two other colleagues who were working nearby ran around to the house and attempted to kick the door down after spotting the fire.

He said: 'Three of us ran down there and tried to kick the door down.  We also put a ladder up against the house and shouted in to see if we could hear anyone, and told the next door neighbour to get out in case it spread.

'The fire brigade arrived after a couple of minutes.'

The female house owner declined to comment, but a spokesman for London Fire Brigade said householders should be aware of the fire risk posed by crystal and glass ornaments and mirrors.

Charlie Pugsley from the fire investigation unit said: 'Crystal and glass ornaments and items such as shaving mirrors should be kept out of direct sunlight.

'The homeowners are lucky they had a working smoke alarm which alerted some local builders who quickly called us.

'Part of the bedroom was damaged in the fire, but it could have been much worse.'

Earlier this year firefighters were called to a blaze in Romford after sun refracted through a crystal ball set light to curtains. And last summer firefighters tackled a fire in Enfield caused by a vanity mirror which also set fire to curtains.

The Fire Brigade said mirrors and crystal or glass objects should be kept away from sunny window sills, while working smoke alarms should be on every floor.
