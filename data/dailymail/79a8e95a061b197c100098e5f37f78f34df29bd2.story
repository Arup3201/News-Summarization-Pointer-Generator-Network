A 'zombie cat' who was run over by a car only to inexplicably return from the dead five days later has successfully undergone surgery on his injuries.

Bart, a black and white cat from Tampa, Florida, had an eye removed and jaw repaired by the Tampa Bay Veterinary Emergency Service on Tuesday.

He is expected to complete an amazing recovery and should be able to return home to his owner in the coming weeks.

Bart shocked owner Ellis Hutson when he showed up back at home five days after an apparently fatal accident.

Unable to afford to fees for Bart’s operation, Hutson had then reached out to the Humane Society of Tampa Bay. 

Through the Save-A-Pet Medical Fund they were able help cover costs of surgery on brave Bart who had been through quite an ordeal.

Hutson had found his pet in a pool of blood in the street, not moving, after a collision earlier this month.

'Living dead': The cat boasted gruesome injuries after his return, and has had surgery to remove his eye, but is expected to return home

Whence he rose: Bart was buried in this shallow hole not far from his home, by Hutson's friend David Liss

But despite having him buried in a shallow dirt grave, Hutson saw him again just five days later - albeit with gruesome wounds and a ruined eye, which has now been removed.

Vets were baffled by Bart's mysterious survival - but Hutson believes his revival may be the doing of his brother and playmate.

Speaking to local news station Fox13 about the strange happening, he suggested that Bart's friend may have gone looking for him and clawed him out of his resting place.

He said: 'We have two cats and they play together all the time and they roam around with each other.

'He might have went looking for his brother and dug him up - but I have no idea'.

Life after death: Bart has been given surgery to repair his broken jaw, and is seen above recovering

The mystery deepened when Hutson revealed that he was so upset by his pet's apparent demise that he did not bury Bart himself - but asked his friend David Liss to do the deed.

Liss said he had no idea how Bart could have been alive. He told Fox13: 'I looked at it, and I looked at it, and I didn't see the chest moving up and down or anything and I said, "you know, well look at the blood, it's dead."'

Experts believe Bart rose from the grave not long after being buried there - but was scared so stayed away from home for several days.
