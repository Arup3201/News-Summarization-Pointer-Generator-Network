A 'neighbor from hell' has been arrested after waging a four-year campaign of terror that allegedly included fire-bombing a neighbor's boat.

Mitchell Igelko faces jail after terrified neighbors installed high-tech security cameras with night vision to catch him carrying out acts of vandalism.

The landscaper is alleged to have poisoned neighbors' gardens, thrown nails on the lawns and even set fire to a boat. Many of the cars in the street have had their tires let down.

Hell-raiser: Mitchell Igelko allegedly stalked his neighbors and made their lives a nightmare in Kendall, Florida

Terror: Neighbors in the Florida community have installed high-tech CCTV to try to catch their neighbor in the act

Police in Kendall, Florida, arrested Igelko on stalking and criminal mischief charges after studying the CCTV footage.

Dr Bob DerHagopian said the harassment began after he hired a rival landscaping company to carry out work on his home.

They noticed their property was being vandalised and spoke with other neighbours who said they had experienced similar problems. Suspecting Igelko was behind the attacks, they set up CCTV cameras capable of filming at night.

'He tries to intimidate you to either respect him and if you don't respect him,' said Dr DerHagopian, 'he'll do damage to you'.

Crime wave: The spate of attacks, which have been captured on CCTV, include car windows being smashed, nails thrown in the grass and a boat being blown up

Hounded: Several of the residents have filmed Igelko following them in their cars and screaming abuse

'I don't think any neighborhood should have to live with this type of fear and anxiety.'

The CCTV cameras captured him spraying what is believed to be a toxic chemical on their lawns.

'He is in his work truck, driving with the window cracked two to three inches,'recalled Francisco Torres.

'I see a red nozzle. I see a lot of jet stream of toxic liquid getting into my grass. I double check with my camera and I got the proof right there.'

In an earlier incident he was filmed tossing bags of nails onto lawns, and launching them from his truck onto the grass and driveways.

Neighbours suspect he was behind the vandalism of several cars and a boat being set on fire. Several cars in the quiet cul-de-sac had flammable liquid poured over them.

'His house was the only one untouched,' remembered Kelly DerHagopian. 'It makes us curious.'

Igelko's lawyer said he has not had a chance to see the CCTV film.
