A green meteor was spotted flashing across the sky on Wednesday night.

Witnesses have described watching the green-tinged ‘fireball’ shoot over England and Wales in a northerly direction at around 9.45pm on Wednesday.

Some observers were convinced it was a UFO, and thousands took to twitter to find out what was happening.

Grabs, taken from CCTV footage in Cardiff, show what appears to be a large meteor flashing across the night sky. The meteor is the small dot seen at the top of the image, in the centre. The meteor looks like a blue and green light and was spotted with a tail behind it moving quickly in the sky on Wednesday. There were also reported sightings in Cornwall, Lancashire, Wales and Worcestershire

The technical name for Halley’s Comet's is Comet 1P/Halley.

A comet is an small body of ice that travels through our solar system.

Halley's Comet orbits the Sun once every 75 years or so.

It can travel close to Neptune and Venue on its orbit around the Sun.

As it gets close to the Sun, the ice it is made of turns into gas, which creates a tail.

The comet also drops debris including dust and gravel as it orbits.

When this debris enters the Earth's atmosphere it begins to burn quickly and brightly and this is what  experts think Wednesday night's meteor was caused by.

Experts believe the meteor might have formed from debris from Halley's Comet.

Sightings were recorded in Cornwall, Hampshire, Lancashire, South Wales and Worcestershire.

Louise Darnell also reported the unusual event on the social networking site.

She wrote: ‘Seen the brightest and lowest shooting star ever! It was definitely a UFO..??’

Virtual Astronomer tweeted a picture of the ‘fireball’ taken over Wiltshire. 

The meteor was captured by cameras from the UK Meteor Network. The left picture was shot by a camera in Clanfield. The right picture shows the meteor over Ash Vale South

Many of the UK Meteor Network’s cameras caught footage of the shooting star on their cameras in Clanfield, Ash Vale.

Reports suggested the meteor crossed Britain from the South East towards the North West.

Space scientist Dr Maggie Aderin-Pocock said last night's shooting star, though unusually large, was likely to have been no bigger than a closed fist and would have travelled at speeds of around 150,000mph.

'When something like that hits the atmosphere, it burns up really brightly,' she said.

'What was unusual about the thing last night is that usually shooting stars are quite small.

'This was quite a large lump passing through the atmosphere so it made quite a large shooting star.'

She said the green or blue flame emitted suggested there was copper in the meteor. 

CCTV cameras in Cardiff also caught sight of the meteor as it travelled across the UK. This image shows a green light that some Twitter users thought was a UFO

The fireball would have been one of a number of shooting stars that crossed the sky last night, as the Earth passed through a trail of dust left by Halley's Comet - an event which occurs twice each year.

Stargazers can expect to see further meteors - around 10 an hour - streaking through the sky until May 20, Dr Aderin-Pocock said.

However, they are likely to decrease in intensity and will only be visible at night and when the skies are relatively clear.
