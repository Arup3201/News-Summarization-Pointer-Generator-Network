Leading charities are defying demands to reveal details of their top executives’ six-figure salaries.

Four months after the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO) said the information should be available online within two clicks from a charity’s home page, The Mail on Sunday has found that only one complies with the guidance.

Even then, a British Heart Foundation spokesman had to explain where the information could be found as it was not obvious.

Only compliant charity: Most organisation still appear not to have published the information in an easy-to-access way

It also disclosed only the £165,000 salary paid to chief executive Simon Gillespie, despite calls for all top salaries to be featured.

Save the Children – whose chief executive, Justin Forsyth, earned £140,000 last year – posts the information on its website, but not two clicks away from the home page.

The 161,000 registered charities in England and Wales have a combined income of more than £39billion a year, with 15,000 staff paid £60,000 a year or more.

Last night, NCVO chief executive Sir Stuart Etherington said: ‘We’ve asked for some pretty simple information – the details of what senior staff are paid, and an explanation of how the charity sets its pay levels.

‘It is straightforward to add this to a website.’
