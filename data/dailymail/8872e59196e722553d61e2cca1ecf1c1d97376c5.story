A young woman is taking the taxidermy craze to the next level... by making stuffed animals wearable.

Jo Shears, 31, spends her spare time turning rabbits, mice and birds into hats and handbags.

Now she’s making a living from the wacky accessories and has even had orders from brides hoping to walk down the aisle in one of her creations.

While it might seem strange to some to have stuffed roadkill perched on your shoulder in a tiny top hat, for some it is the new frontier of fashion

The unusual creations like a raven feathered hat (left) and a winged mouse hair clip (right)  are created by Jo in her studio in Ealing, West London

From the tiny studio in her flat in Ealing, West London, Jo cleans between the spines of hedgehogs and prepares birds of all shapes and sizes to make them into exotic headgear.

As part of her attempt to keep her work ethical, the majority of her ‘subjects’ are roadkill - commonly found English animals like foxes and squirrels that have met an untimely death thanks to traffic.

But it’s not a quick and easy job - to make a hat can take over a week. This includes the man hours, the tanning process and the drying out time necessary to complete a fancy hat or stole.

Far from being reserved for bereaved pet lovers and crazy celebrities, Jo now has commissions from the most unlikely of clientele: brides to be.

Each piece requires hours of painstaking work to create, often taking over a week to finish

Jo started collecting taxidermy years before attempting it herself, progressing from mice to large creatures

After floating the idea that a stuffed creature could add that unique twist every couple is looking for, Jo has become a hit at wedding fairs.

She has made headpieces from birds and buttonholes from furs. One bride has asked her to make her a handbag for the day of her wedding from a cat.

Even grooms are getting in on the act - she recently completed a necklace made from a raven skull, alongside a whole stuffed raven, for one male customer.

Despite working in marketing, Jo is hoping to take her taxidermy full-time as soon as she gets the chance.

Jo said: 'As a child I spent lots of my time pressed up against the glass at museums looking at stuffed animals.

A taxidermy hat or head piece can require days of tanning and drying out on top of the hours of craftsmanship

Surprisingly Jo's work has caused her to become a favorite at wedding fairs, as couples search for that 'something different' for their big day

'I’d always been a little macabre but about four years ago I started collecting taxidermy properly.

'I lived in Japan for a couple of years and when I came back I decided to give it a go myself.

'I just bought a frozen mouse from the vet and tried it out.

'I joined the UK guild of taxidermists after that and it’s been growing since then.

'Last year I set up commercially and it’s really taken off.

Jo hopes the success of her business means she will soon be able to do taxidermy full time

Most pieces are made from roadkill - commonly found English animals like foxes and squirrels that have met an untimely death thanks to traffic

'Because of the massive resurgence in interest in taxidermy my work is in demand.

'But it’s much more difficult than it looks. People who do a three-hour mouse stuffing class and think that they’ll be able to go off and do it at home are mistaken. It takes a lot of training.

'The results of my first mouse were pretty terrible but it’s a life-long learning experience.

'If there’s something really tricky I have to keep putting it back in the freezer to give my brain a break.

'Now I specialise in wearable taxidermy. It’s mainly a lot of hats but I do all sorts of things. But I try to keep it ethical by mainly using roadkill.

'The reaction has been pretty mixed: some people think it’s wonderful and are desperate to order.

'Others think it’s disgusting or just can’t see how it will fit into their special day, let alone their own wardrobe.'
