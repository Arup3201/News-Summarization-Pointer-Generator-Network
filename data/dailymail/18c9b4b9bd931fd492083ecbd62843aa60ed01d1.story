A motorist who abandoned this luxury Ferrari after losing control of the supercar during a police chase and ploughing it into a pile of rubble was being hunted by officers today.

Other cars had to swerve to avoid a head on crash with the Ferrari F430 as it lurched across the road into oncoming traffic, before smashing into a construction site.

The driver then allegedly fled the scene of the crash, which took place on a road between Prelouci and Pardubice in the east of the Czech Republic, and caused more than £20,000 worth of damage.

Prior to the crash, the car had been involved in a late-night police chase, and it is thought the driver lost control of the vehicle during heavy rain.

With the black car lodged atop a pile of rubble, and large parts of its front torn away in the impact of the collision, the driver abandoned the vehicle, prompting a police search.

'The driver doesn't appear to be injured as he ran off after crashing,' said spokesman Eva Maturova.

'A tracker dog picked up his trail, but then lost it after a few metres because of the weather conditions.'

Ms Maturova added that a sample of blood picked up by the dog turned out to have belonged to a worker who had cut his hands working on the construction site a short while earlier.

Police have not disclosed if the driver was the owner of the car, or if it had been stolen.

The F430 model was unveiled during the 2004 Paris Motor Show, and was in production until 2009 when the Italian car giants replaced it with the 458 Italia.

When new, the car cost around £119,500 in Britain, and was capable of reaching speeds of 196mph, and accelerating from 0 to 100km per hour in 4.4 seconds thanks to its 4.3litre V8 engine.

In February 2009, Ferrari recalled around 1,950 convertible Spider  F430s made between 2005 and 2007 due to fears that heat from the engine could cause the soft top hydraulic hoses to fracture and leak flammable fluid onto engine.
