An avid Google Maps user has created his own font using satellite images of letter-shaped buildings in New York. 

Yousuke Ozawa, 34, picked out 26 buildings which look like letters of the alphabet and brought them together to make his own original font.

Mr Ozawa got the idea for his satellite font during a slow day at work.

The letter B, which Mr Ozawa discovered when he had nothing to do while working for an advertising agency

He then spent the next week scouring images of New York buildings to try and find the complete alphabet. Pictured is the letter C

Some letters, such as F (pictured), would take hours to find on Google Earth, Mr Ozawa said

Although some of the letters may have been plucked from Manhattan's aptly-titled Alphabet City, he had to search across the entire city in order to find the perfect A to Z.

He said: 'I was a designer for an advertising agency at the time. I didn't have much work to do so I started looking at my old neighbourhood on Google Earth. 

'I noticed a building in the shape of an A and then another in the shape of a B.

'I started looking for more letter shaped buildings, hunting them down in alphabetical order.

'I'd often spend hours looking for a single building in the shape of the correct letter. After a week I had collected the entire alphabet.'

Mr Ozawa, who said the photos captured from Google Maps are unedited, decided to share his font with the world by posting it online.

Mr Ozawa (left) tested his font by creating a mock movie poster (right) for the film Enemy of the State - the 1998 Will Smith film about a man being spied on by the U.S. Government

He said: 'At the moment I haven't made it a usable font but I do intend to make it a typeface people can download in the future.

'It would be a great font for movie posters.'

Mr Ozawa, of New York, even put his font to the test by creating his own movie poster for the 1998 Will Smith film 'Enemy of the State', which involves a character being spied on by government satellites.
