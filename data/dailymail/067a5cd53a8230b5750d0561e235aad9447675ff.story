The notorious white supremacist Craig Cobb was taken to jail in handcuffs on Saturday after 'patrolling' around Leith, North Dakota with rifles and threatening citizens.

Resident Gregory Bruce and Leith City Councilman Lee Cook called 911 and took pictures of Cobb, 62, and his neo-Nazi associate Kynan Dutton, 29, after the men stood at the edge of Cook's property with their fingers on the triggers of their weapons.

Still armed, the men then followed Leith resident, Miller Ferrie, to her house and exchanged words with her husband as she, in hysterics, called the sheriff whose deputies then arrived and took them into custody.

Offensive signs: Cobb has bought up some 13 homes in Leith and aims to take over the town's government, turning the area into a 'white enclave'

Cobb has bought up some 13 homes in 
Leith and aims to take over the town's government, turning the area into
a 'white enclave'.

He has posted new signs with racial slurs and is 
flying swastika flags on his property in town, according to the Bismarck Tribune.

However, Saturday's gun-wielding raises three months of tension to a new high.

Grant
County Sheriff Steve Bay said he's assembling evidence for three 
separate charges of terrorizing against Cobb and Dutton, adding that 
residents should feel at ease at least for now while the two men are 
behind bars.

Arrest: In a text message to the Bismarck Tribune before he was taken into custody, Cobb said he and Dutton had 'commenced armed patrols of Leith'

Dutton is already on bond for a 
charge of disorderly conduct for drunken behavior in Leith and fresh 
charges are likely to violate his bond conditions.

In a text message to the Bismarck 
Tribune before he was taken into custody, Cobb said, 'Because of the 
many violences (sic) and harassments against we (sic) and the children, 
we have commenced armed patrols of Leith.'

In a second text, Cobb said he has new plans to name some of his property the 'Adolph Hitler Pvt. Park of Leith.'

Deborah Dutton accompanied the men around town recording the interactions on a cell phone. As
she wasn't armed, deputies didn't take her into custody. She remains at
Cobb's house with five children, the youngest of which is four.

Bay
told the Tribune he knew the situation in the town would escalate 
'sooner or later' and said he was relieved that no shots were fired.

Cook and Bruce were likely targeted as they have been posting updates about the neo-Nazi activities on the website, Leithnd.com.

Cook
said he moved his family out of the town weeks ago for their safety and
was at his home on Saturday to install security cameras.

He said he wasn't satisfied with how 
authorities were handling Cobb, who he claims was cocky and arrogant 
when he approached his property with the gun Saturday.

'He thought he was something. He thinks he owns this town,' Cook told the newspaper. 'They deserve more than what they get. I know it's not over. Cobb is obviously desperate.'

The latest incident comes after Cobb underwent a DNA test which proved he is of Sub-Saharan African heritage and then refused to fist-bump the black host who delivered him the news.

The white supremacist submitted to the test earlier this month as part of The Trisha Show's ongoing Race in America series and was given the results of the DNA Diagnostics test by the host, Trisha Goddard, to the whoops of her studio audience.

On hearing the results Cobb, who insists he is not a white supremacist but a Creator, a religion which favors 'racial awareness,' immediately dismissed the news that genetically he is 14 per cent Sub Saharan African, 86 per cent European, as 'statistical noise.'
