Broadway theatres will dim their marquee lights tonight in honour of James Gandolfini.

While he is best known for his role as the star of TV drama The Sopranos, the actor, who died last week aged 51, also had a successful career on the stage.

New York's theatres are set to pay him their greatest sign of respect when they turn off their lights for one minute at 8pm.

Success: Gandolfini on stage with Hope Davis and Jeff Daniels in God of Carnage, for which he was nominated for a Tony Award in 2009

'James Gandolfini was a consummate actor who brought individuality to each role and inspired a true connection with the audience,' said Charlotte St Martin of the Broadway League.

'Whether on screen or on the Broadway stage, he made every role believable and seemingly effortless.

'Our thoughts go out to his family and friends, and certainly to all of his fans who felt as if they knew his characters.'

Gandolfini was nominated for a Tony Award for best actor in 2009 for his role in God of Carnage by Yasmina Reza.

He also appeared in productions such as A Streetcar Named Desire in 1992 and 1995's On the Waterfront.

Dimming the marquees is an honour handed out just a few times each year to mark the deaths of prominent actors, directors, crewmembers or other figures from the theatrical world.

Gandolfini died in Rome last Wednesday while on holiday with his family. His 13-year-old son found him having a heart attack in the bathroom of their hotel room.

The star, who was working on an upcoming HBO series and has two films due out next year, had been due to attend the Taormina Film Festival in Sicily.

Funeral: The 51-year-old will be laid to rest tomorrow at the Cathedral Church of Saint John the Divine

His body was flown back to the U.S. on Sunday, and his funeral will take place tomorrow at the Cathedral Church of Saint John the Divine in New York City.

Gandolfini's sisters Leta and Johanna were seen yesterday visiting the offices of HBO, which broadcast the series that made the actor world-famous.

Tomorrow's service for family and friends is set to be a 'beautiful funeral Mass', according to vicar Julia Whitworth.
