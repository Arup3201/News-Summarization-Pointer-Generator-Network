Blunder: Sylvia Dawson was taken 30 miles from her home in Appleby, Cumbria, after medical staff gave a taxi driver her wrong address

The family of a grandmother with severe dementia are furious after she was sent home from hospital alone in a taxi - naked but for a flimsy bed gown.

Medical staff gave the cab driver the wrong address and his passenger Sylvia Dawson, 76, was incapable of telling him where she lived.

So she had to sit, unchaperoned, in the front seat as the driver tried to locate the home she shares with her husband Terry, 80, more than 30 miles away.

When she finally arrived at their front door in the middle of a rainstorm she emerged distressed from the car - still clutching the plastic bag with the clothes hospital staff had not bothered to dress her in.

Health chiefs at the failing NHS trust running the A & E department involved have apologised unreservedly for the retired mother-of-three’s appalling treatment.

Tragically, within two days of her returning home, Mrs Dawson’s condition deteriorated rapidly and she was taken into residential care. It is unlikely she will return home.

Her family believe that although this would have been eventually inevitable, her ordeal in the taxi hastened her decline.

Mr Dawson, a retired IT consultant who has three children and eight grandchildren with his wife, said he was ‘resentful, disillusioned and shattered’ by her treatment.

He said: ‘I can’t put it into words - it is beyond belief.

‘I can’t imagine what staff were thinking when they put her into that taxi, undressed, and when it was very cold, pouring with rain and blowing half a gale.

‘She was clearly distressed, and stark naked save for a hospital gown and light wrap.

‘It was the sheer callousness of the way they sent her home – their shipping her off in the nearest cattle wagon they could find.’

In August, Mrs Dawson was assessed by carers and a psychologist and even then was unable to answer the simplest of cognitive questions.

Terry and Sylvia Dawson. Mr Dawson, 80, said he was horrified to find his distressed wife had been sent home by staff at the A&E Department of the hospital, after treating her for a cut to her head

Mrs Dawson, a former office manager, was diagnosed with vascular dementia four years ago and has been cared for since then at home in Appleby, Cumbria, by her husband, with the support of social services and a private carer.

On Wednesday last week, she was rushed to Cumberland Infirmary, Carlisle, after cutting her head in a fall – but a scan showed it was not serious.

Within a couple of hours, Mr Dawson received a call saying his wife was on her way back to him at home.

He added: ‘It would have been obvious to anyone at A&E that she wouldn’t have had any idea which way was up when they put her into that taxi.

‘She suffers very seriously with dementia and she’s not exactly very articulate. She would have had no idea where her correct address was or what was going on.’

‘The cabbie came to the door and the carer took over from there. I don’t think I was in too much of a state to do much.

‘The next thing I remember is that my wife was sitting in the kitchen with the carer bending over her taking off her hospital gown and fishing into the plastic bag which contained all of her clothes.’

Mr Dawson has formally complained to the trust and to the Care Quality Commission.

The CQC is already investigating the North Cumbria Hospitals Trust, which runs the site, after it was one of 11 which featured in the Keogh Review highlighting unacceptably high death rates and was put into special measures.

Yesterday Chris Platton, acting director of nursing and quality at the North Cumbria NHS Trust, apologised ‘wholeheartedly’ for what happened.

‘The circumstances around Mrs Dawson's discharge from hospital are clearly unacceptable and do not meet the high standards of safe and compassionate care that we aim to provide, especially for our most vulnerable elderly patients,’ he said.

‘As soon as this matter was brought to our attention on Friday we started a full formal investigation.’
