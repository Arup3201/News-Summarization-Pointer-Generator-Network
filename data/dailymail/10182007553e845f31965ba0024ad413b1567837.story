Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer was revered for his strikingly realistic 17th century paintings because they were able to capture light and detail like never before.

Yet in 2006 fellow artist David Hockney stirred up controversy by claiming Vermeer was only able to paint this well because he used a lens and mirror contraption – similar to a camera obscura.

Since then art critics have come out in support of both Vermeer and Hockney, but one inventor now claims to have finally solved the mystery – and he is 95 per cent sure Hockney’s theories are correct.

Inventor Tim Jenison, 58, was given Hockney’s book Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters by his daughter in 2002, according to a report in Vanity Fair. 

Jenison claimed he had a hunch that what Hockney was saying about Vermeer was true and then one day while in the bath, he realised that the images could be created by projecting the subject through a lens onto a mirror that would have been positioned in Vermeer’s line of sight.

The Texas-born production editor then travelled to Amsterdam to look at Vermeer’s work, studied the locations where Vermeer painted in his hometown of Delft, and learned to read Dutch.

'Looking at their Vermeers,' he said 'I had an epiphany.'

'The photographic tone is what jumped out at me. Why was Vermeer so realistic? Because he got the (colour) values right.'

Jenison also tested out various contraptions to discover which was the most likely.

A camera obscura is based on the principle that when some of the rays reflected from a bright subject pass through a small hole in thin material, they reform as an upside down on a surface parallel to the hole. In 2006 artist David Hockney accused Vermeer of using a contraption similar to this

One of the strongest counterarguments against Hockney’s claims was that if Vermeer had used a camera obscura, the image would have been upside down, but Jenison discovered that using a second mirror solved this problem.

His final design, which Jenison claims he is 95 per cent sure would have been how Vermeer would had painted his masterpieces, involves two mirrors and a four-inch lens.

The image is projected through the lens onto a 7-inch concave mirror fixed to the wall opposite. This mirror bounces the image onto a smaller 2 x 4-inch mirror situated next to the canvas.

If Vermeer used this system, he would have been able to paint with little movement of his head and capture the light and detail more accurately.

Early models of the camera obscura were large; comprising either a whole darkened room or a tent. By the 18th century, following developments by Robert Boyle and Robert Hooke, more easily portable models became available

To test his theory, Jenison has spent the past decade – a total of 220 hours - recreating the room Vermeer would have painted in and attempting to recreate his 1662 painting The Music Lesson.

He also made lenses that would have been made using 17th century techniques and only painted with pigments available in the late 1600s. 

American illusionists Penn and Teller installed cameras in Jenison's studio to record everything. They now plan to turn the footage into an 80-minute film.

The film, named 'Tim's Vermeer' will be released in February.

If you go into a dark room on a sunny day and make a tiny hole in a window, you’ll see a strange effect on the opposite wall – the world outside the window will be shown upside down. 

This is because light travels in a straight line. When some of the rays reflected from a bright subject pass through a small hole in thin material, they reform as an upside down on a surface parallel to the hole

Chinese philosopher Mo-Ti is thought to be the first person to mention this phenomenon in the 5th century BC.  In 13th-century England, Roger Bacon described the use of a camera obscure for the safe observation of solar eclipses.  In 1490 Leonardo Da Vinci gave two clear descriptions of the camera obscura in his notebooks.

Early models were large; comprising either a whole darkened room or a tent. By the 18th century, following developments by Robert Boyle and Robert Hooke, more easily portable models became available.

Unlike tradiational models, Vermeer's camera obscura would have used two mirrors and a four-inch lens.

The
 image would have been projected through the lens onto a 7-inch concave mirror fixed 
to the wall opposite. This mirror bounced the image onto a smaller 2 x 
4-inch mirror situated next to the canvas.

If
 Vermeer used this system, he would have been able to paint with little 
movement of his head and capture the light and detail more accurately.
