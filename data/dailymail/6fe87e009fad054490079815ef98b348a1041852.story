It has been an exercise in diplomacy and stealth – a careful negotiation of appearance and reality which can only be revealed now.

Over the past seven days the FBI, the law enforcement services of Dale County and Mobile, Alabama, the State Patrol and Sheriff’s office have combined to mount an operation under intense scrutiny – with intense secrecy.

And for the past seven days the assembled media have abided by the FBI’s requests to maintain that secrecy and to leave unreported the movements of materials and manpower we have witnessed - to ensure that Jimmy Lee Dykes, who had access to TV and internet in his underground bunker, did not learn of their plans or get spooked by the growing force around him.

FBI agents built a mock bunker nearby the scene to work out how best to conduct the raid. Military surveillance equipment - including a camera that was delicately inserted into the bunker - and personnel were used during the standoff.  

Ready to go: These heavily-armed agents with the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team gear up with equipment delivered in a Budget rental truck

Moving out: The federal agents were always at the ready and prepared to storm the bunker where little Ethan was being held

Heavy equipment: The FBI brought in numerous trucks, as well as helicopters, bomb detectors and sophisticated surveillance equipment

CNN correspondent Barbara Starr reports that Defense Secretary Leon Panetta personally approved the FBI using its gear and engineers during the operations.

A citadel of surveillance has been erected – all unreported until now, all as negotiators hoped for a peaceful outcome.

However, it was the FBI's elite Hostage Rescue Team, and not U.S. troops that, that stormed the bunker and recused five-year-old Ethan.

Within hours of survivalist Jimmy Lee Dikes’ shooting of school bus driver Charles ‘Chuck’ Poland and his abduction of the boy, the FBI became involved.

With their arrival came an abrupt shut down of communications.

Safe: Little Ethan, age 5, is safe after he was taken hostage last Tuesday by Jimmy Lee Dykes and held in an underground bunker for several days

Dead: Jimmy Lee Dykes, 65, the hostage-taker, died in the FBI raid on his bunker

On the first call to the scene on Tuesday afternoon the local officers called upon assistance from neighbouring Houston County.

An
 alarm went out to all local emergency services locally and, as one fire
 officer speaking to MailOnline, said ‘It was like everything was lit 
up. Then the FBI got involved and “boom” everything went quiet.’

For the first four hours on that first day a local police lieutenant spoke with Dykes.

He lay on the grass and spoke down the PVC pipe that emerged from the ground as the only sign of the bunker beneath. As the situation dragged on, that pipe became the only means of passing supplies of medicine, toys and treats to the little boy below.

Local officers remained the ones who made the perilous trip through Dykes’s compound to deliver Ethan’s medicine – he suffers from ADHD and mild autism – as, according to one Houston County source, ‘They figured that they’d managed to walk the path there before without getting blown up so they might as well keep doing it.’

In truth, it seems unlikely that the FBI’s reasoning was quite that casual. But they did fear that Dykes’s had rigged the bunker and the land surrounding it with explosives.

As well as knowing that Dykes had a gun, neighbours told officers that they believed he had pipe bombs.

On the second day sniffer dogs were brought in trained in detecting explosives.

The land was x-rayed and a decision made not to lower any sort of wire, or camera into the bunker as a result.

Among the first request made by Dykes was that a reporter be brought in to tell his story.

MailOnline has learned that his repeated and particular request was for ‘four minutes on all the major TV networks’ to tell what Sherriff Wally Olson described as ‘a complex story.’

The side track leading to the small neighbourhood in which Dykes lived and in which he dug out his final resting place, was closed off to all but residents who were checked in and out by guards.

Eyes in the sky: Helicopters circled the sky around the bunker as the FBI closed in on Monday

On Saturday there was a marked increase of agency presence. Two tactical vehicles arrived on the scene and parked in the dust across the road from the assembled press. The silver trailers bore the FBI emblem and initials.

A large black mobile Crime Scene Unit was slowly driven up to the edge of the large barn at the crest of the hill behind which the bunker lay.

Heavily armed Hostage Rescue Teams were seen moving up on either side of that barn – tracking round the back and out of view.

The impression as each day passed was of a man well and truly surrounded and, though Dykes had access to television and Internet in his subterranean bunker, completely in the dark.

As negotiators changed shifts, their 
handovers visible between 3 and 4pm each day, no significant news 
emerged other than the fact of their ongoing negotiations.

Far and wide: Federal agents traveled to Alabama from across the country, and Alabama police came in from across the state

Working together: Law enforcement officials from the FBI, the Dale county Sheriff's Office and the Alabama State Police all collaborated on the standoff

On Friday evening a plane landed on the outskirts of the local airport and was met on the tarmac by a fleet of Budget Rental Vans. Equipment was unloaded. By Saturday morning those vans were parked up the sidetrack next to the barn.

Bit by bit as the net closed – as firepower descended and electronic surveillance watched – the official message, which was delivered with the knowledge that Dykes was watching, was that authorities were grateful to him for caring for Ethan.

But the moment they felt he no longer was, they were ready. For the first time in a long time Dykes, disturbed and paranoid, may have believed he was in charge. But at 3.12 on Monday afternoon that final delusion proved his undoing.

Special Agent Bomb Technicians continue to clear the scene and only after their work is done will Evidence Response Teams move into process the scene.
