She's famous for her colourful hats and now, a fascinating collection of previously unseen letters to her milliner has revealed just how much the Queen adores them.

The letters, written to long-serving hat-maker Philip Somerville over 25 years, the missives also touch on Her Majesty's passion for corgis and her knowledge of running a business.

Others contain thanks for hats made by Mr Somerville and a touching sentence in which the Queen describes herself as 'almost the only person' who wears hats all the time.

Passion for hats: The Queen's love of colourful headgear has been revealed in letters to her milliner

Four of the epistles are now set to go under the hammer alongside a set of invitations and signed cards sent to Mr Somerville, who died last year aged 84.

But it is the letters that are likely to attract the most interest, with auctioneers saying they could fetch as much as £2,000 when they are sold later this month. 

In one of the notes, which was written to Mr Somerville and dated January 5, 2009, the Queen thanks him for a Christmas present of a china corgi.

'Thank you so much for the charming china Corgi you gave me for Christmas,' she wrote. 'I am so pleased to have it and it is a good portrayal of the breed. It will join my assorted collection of them!'

She added: 'Can I once more express my great gratitude for all the help and the fine hats I have had over the years from you.'

Recipient: Philip Somerville, who died last year aged 84, made the Queen's hats for over 25 years

Handwritten: In the missives, the Queen details her love of corgis and thanks Mr Somerville for his work

In another from February 25, 2007, she writes: 'Thank you for your letter telling me of the outcome of your business.

'I am very glad to hear that you will still be able to work for me... I know how difficult business can be nowadays - specially with matching fabrics for someone like me who must be almost the only person who wears hats constantly!'

Another thank you note written on January 19, 2008, reads: 'Thank you so much for my Christmas present. It is sitting here on my desk and is very enjoyable.

'I fear this is very late - I seem to have been so busy even in the holidays. I am glad to hear your pacemaker is working well for you, it must be a great relief.

'I expect there will be a need for a few hats in the coming months!'

Philip Somerville began making hats for the Queen in the early 1980s, a role he held right through to his retirement in 2008.

He also made hats for Princess Diana, the Duchess of Kent, Queen Silvia of Sweden, and members of the Dutch and Greek royal families.

Other clients included well-known figures such as Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, Joan Collins and Lady Thatcher.

His hats were also worn by a string of Bond girls including Famke Janssen in 1995 film Goldeneye, and Sophie Marceau in The World Is Not Enough from 1999.

'The letters are fascinating because they give a very rare glimpse of the Queen’s personal side, revealing her to be very sweet, humble and funny,' says Lydia Wilkinson, co-ordinator of the auction, which takes place at Fraser's Autographs in London on 20th March.

'The majority of people only ever see the Queen in her official role where she is required to be formal and quite serious, but these letters show a completely different side to her.

'The Queen is a big fan of hats and it’s quite clear from the correspondence that she and Mr Somerville, as her milliner, were very close.

'The market for Royal memorabilia is always strong so we are expecting a large amount of interest in these letters, not just from the UK but from the US as well where the Royal family are much loved.'

From colourful cocktail numbers to elaborate feathered headpieces, the Queen is almost as famous for her hats as she is for her constitutional role.

In France, her headgear is looked upon with total fascination, while in the UK, Her Majesty's hats are traditionally the subject of bets during Royal Ascot week.

Since the death of Mr Somerville, most of the Queen's hats are the work of her dressmaker, Angela Kelly, who was also responsible for the ivory number worn to greet the President and First Lady of Mexico earlier this week.

But regardless of who is making them, as these photos reveal, Her Majesty is never anything less than beautifully turned out.
