A teenager who attracted national attention when her racy high school yearbook photo was rejected for being too revealing has been arrested at a house party - along with her mother.

Sydney Spies, 18, allegedly tried to stop police arresting her mother, Denise 'Miki' Spies, who attempted to run away when authorities found teenagers drinking alcohol in her home.

Police arrived to find numerous underage drinkers with a beer keg, liquor bottles and cups of alcohol at the home in Durango, Colorado,  
at 11.20 p.m. on Sunday, authorities said.Â

When partygoers spotted the police, they
hopped over a chain-link fence in the back garden and ran up a steep 
hill behind the house, The Durango Herald reported.

Police approached Miki Spies, 45, and she allegedly refused to give her name or date of birth. She then 'broke into a full sprint for her front door', according to an incident report.

Officers chased her to her bedroom where she tried to slam the door. After a struggle, she was arrested.

Her daughter had allegedly tried to stop police from catching her mother. When the teen was arrested for obstructing a police officer and put in a patrol car, she attempted to escape.

'She nearly kicked me in the groin,' an officer wrote in his report about the teenager's struggle.

Her mother was charged with contributing
to the delinquency of a minor and misdemeanor counts of obstructing a 
police officer and resisting arrest and released on $10,000 bond.

Uproar: Spies had submitted this photograph for the yearbook but the committee deemed it inappropriate

The younger Spies was also released, on $500 bond.

On Facebook page on Monday evening, she posted: 'I just love being targeted. What a bunch of BS.'

But it's not the first arrest for her mother, who was charged with  resisting arrest, obstructing a police officer and trespassing for making noise in a church park early on June 24, records show.

As she was arrested, she began yelling that police were only called because she was a lesbian and shouted obscenities about Christians at the church's pastor, who had asked her to be quiet.

As police carried her to the car, she went limp and appeared as if she had been drinking.

'She
asked how long I had been a police officer,' an officer said in the arrest report. 'I answered that I was 
approaching my seventh year. She then said, "Well, you suck at it".'

Not shy: The exposure following the scandal led to a small movie role in a Syfy movie for Spies

She has pleaded not guilty to all three charges and has a pre-trial conference on Tuesday.

It
is not the sort of attention Spies wished to garner after hitting 
headlines for the provocative photograph that was rejected by the 
yearbook committee at Durango High School in January.

When she submitted a second 
photograph - of her wearing a strapless dress - the group rejected it 
again, claiming she was showing too much skin, and she and her mother 
challenged the decision.

Amid the furor, Sydney and her mother 
protested outside the school and appeared on the Today show to discuss 
the photograph, which shows her wearing just a short yellow skirt and a 
black shawl.

'I honestly think it describes who I 
am,' Sydney told Today host Matt Lauer. 'People can take it however they
want, but I'm an outgoing person, and I really do think it's artistic.'

The exposure landed the aspiring model and actress a role in a movie on the Syfy channel, which will air on Halloween.

Speaking out: Sydney and her mother on the Today show after the story broke in January. Her mother allegedly tried to run away from police when they found underage drinkers in her home

Protest: The Spies challenged the yearbook committee decision by protesting outside the school

She will play a character named 'Missy' in 
the science-fiction station for a movie called
American Horror House, Spies revealed earlier this year.

Sydney Spies told the Westwood newspaper in Denver: 'The head of the Syfy network said he wanted me to be in a movie. So they got hold of me and my mom and flew me out to Louisiana.'

She has now completed her senior year but decided not to attend her graduation ceremony.

Instead, she has been focusing on her prospective career as a model and actress although these latest photographs - mugshots - are perhaps not what she had in mind.
