New allegations: Two more people have lodged complaints against Jimmy Savile, who died last year

Two more alleged victims of Sir Jimmy Savile have come forward, meaning four police forces have now received complaints against the TV presenter.

Northamptonshire Police said it has been contacted by two members of the public with allegations that occurred outside the county that will therefore be referred to other forces.

The news comes as police across the country issued advice to anyone who thinks they might be a victim, and the Association of Chief Police Officers said the national child protection unit CEOP would assess the scale of the allegations.

It follows the screening of a documentary aired last night amid growing allegations against the late Top Of The Pops host.

Historic accounts, which detailed how the presenter allegedly targeted girls in his BBC dressing room and private Rolls-Royce, were shown after Surrey Police confirmed it had referred a historic rape allegation against the Jim’ll Fix It star to Scotland Yard.

Surrey Police has also confirmed it investigated Sir Jimmy over abuse claims in 2007, but dropped the case due to a lack of evidence, while Jersey and Sussex Police said they had both received complaints about the star.

Scotland Yard added last night that it was also assessing a small number of other allegations.

In Exposed: The Other Side Of Jimmy Savile, a total of five women claimed they were indecently assaulted by the TV and radio personality when they were schoolgirls in the late 1960s and 1970s.

Two of the alleged victims said they first had sexual relations with the TV and radio personality when they were 15 - with a number of the indecent acts taking place in his dressing room at BBC television centre.

Another two women who attended Duncroft Approved School For Girls, a now-closed children’s home in Surrey, claimed they were targeted by Sir Jimmy when he regularly visited the school in the 1970s.

The revelations came after former Duncroft pupil Karin Ward, another alleged victim who waived her right to anonymity, claimed the star would ply girls with gifts and have sex with pupils as young as 14.

Coleen Nolan also revealed that Sir Jimmy suggested she join him at a hotel following a TV recording when she was just 14. She had been in the Top Of The Pops studio, along with her chart star sisters who were appearing on the show.

An ex-BBC press officer has also 
claimed that the former head of Radio 1 was aware in the early 1970s of 
sexual abuse allegations involving Sir Jimmy.

Rodney
Collins said the late Douglas Muggeridge, an ex-controller of the BBC 
radio station, asked him to find out if newspapers were looking into 
rumours about the presenter in 1973.

Mr
Collins, who was head of press for Radio 1 when Sir Jimmy worked at the
station, told The Guardian: 'The BBC should now - having first of all 
said they knew nothing about this - there should be a full inquiry, they
should co-operate with the police.

'If anyone working there at the time had some knowledge of this they should put their hands up.'

Following the screening of the documentary, police forces across the country published notices advising any potential victims to contact them, or call children’s charity NSPCC Anyone on 0808 800 5000 for support.

Meanwhile, a circular gold plaque displayed in Scarborough as a memorial to Sir Jimmy, who had a home in the town, was subject to a graffiti attack with the words 'rapist' and 'paedophile'.

Authorities in North Yorkshire say they are now reviewing security at the cemetery where his headstone was placed, following his death at the age of 84 last year. A statue of the star has also been taken down in Glasgow.

The BBC said it will assist police with investigations into the child abuse claims surrounding the presenter.

A spokesman said: 'We have asked the BBC investigations unit to make direct contact with all the police forces in receipt of allegations and offer to help them investigate these matters and provide full support to any lines of inquiry they wish to pursue.'
