An Iranian asylum seeker has been declared brain dead and is likely to have his life support turned off, refugee advocates claim.

Hamid Kehazaei, 24, was airlifted from Papua New Guinea to Brisbane last week for emergency treatment for a life-threatening skin infection.

He was suffering from septicaemia from an infection which spread from a cut on its foot that had been there for a few weeks and which he had spent days trying to seek medical attention for, the ABC reports.

Hamid Kehazaei, an Iranian asylum seeker being held at Manus Island, was declared brain dead on Tuesday

Now, according to Refugee Action Coalition spokesman Ian Rintoul, the man has been declared brain dead.

A legal guardian will discuss turning off life support with his family in Iran on Wednesday.

The family have indicated they wish to have his organs donated.

A spokesman for Immigration Minister Scott Morrison declined to comment on the man's medical condition, saying 'the individual has not died'.

'Out of respect to the family of the individual further details are not able to be provided.' 

The 24-year-old was transferred to a Port Moresby hospital (pictured) after suffering from septicaemia following a cut on his foot. He suffered a heart attack at the hospital and was taken to a Brisbane hospital

Initially he was transferred to a Port Moresby hospital last Wednesday, where he had a heart attack before being sent to Brisbane.

Mr Rintoul claimed asylum seekers on Manus Island sometimes had to walk through raw sewage.

'Nothing else to describe it, but it is just sheer negligence,' Mr Rintoul told the ABC.

'Hamid is a victim of the shocking conditions and medical neglect on Manus Island.' 

Australian Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young is concerned Mr Kehazaei was medivaced too late and has demanded an explanation from Mr Morrison.

He is believed to have spent days seeking treatment for his cut foot  that had been there for a few weeks at the Manus Island detention centre (pictured)

Mr Kehazaei was among the first group of asylum seekers transferred to the Manus Island detention centre following a resettlement deal the Rudd government struck with PNG in 2013.

A spokeswoman from the Mater Hospital declined to comment citing patient privacy.

Campaigning organisation Getup! has announced that they will hold vigils for Mr Kehazaei across the country over the next few days.

Similar vigils under the same name, Light The Dark, were also held after the death of  23-year-old Iranium asylum seeker Reza Berati.
