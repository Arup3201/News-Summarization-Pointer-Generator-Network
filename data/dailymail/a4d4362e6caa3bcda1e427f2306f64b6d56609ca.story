They have tackled the likes of Star Wars, Batman and Harry Potter, but now TT Games have tried their hand at The Lord of the Rings.

And like the others that came before it, the result is a magnificent blend of authenticity with a delicate dusting of LEGO.

The story follows the narratives from all three of The Lord of the Rings films, with TT focusing on the trilogy’s most memorable moments.

One game to rule them all: This is by far the best LEGO game yet

Although fans may notice some omissions, particularly towards the end of the game, the overarching sense of one continuous quest runs true throughout LEGO Lord of the Rings.

This is partly down to the audio and dialogue, which has been lifted directly from the movies. However, given this somewhat limited audio palette, astonishingly, TT still manage to bring a smile to your face – largely down to the cutscenes.

Whether it’s watching Gandalf repeatedly bang his head on the lights in Bilbo Baggins’ house, or Frodo clumsily drop the ring in a mug filled with tea, they add a welcome comic element while respecting the source material.

Gameplay follows the same structure as other LEGO games, although there is much more freedom.

There are still an emphasis on plaforming elements, puzzle-solving and item gathering, but TT Games has created a world that encourages and rewards the player for exploration.

The developers are rightly proud of the world they have created, too – the ample number of side-quests luring the player into every possible nook of the game’s map.

Characters can carry up to eight items, but have a shared ‘Treasure Trove’ which houses an additional 84. Some can be found and others crafted from Mithril bricks amassed through your journey.

Each character has a distinct ability – for example Legolas can use his bow to shoot targets, and Gimli can be thrown at larger foes.

Although AI does a decent job in helping take down waves of enemies, this is a game best enjoyed with friends –  the drop-in co-op catering to those after a quick pick-up-and-play.

Mind your step! Graphics look brilliant on console and PC - capturing the essence of the trilogy by cleverly blending LEGO with largely organic environments

The entire epic adventure is made all the more enjoyable by the wonderful graphics. Particularly impressive is the draw distance and the dynamic surroundings.

Nothing is stuck on, so everywhere from the Misty Mountains to the far reaches of Middle-earth is available to explore.

Instead of converting the environments into LEGO pieces, TT have opted to keep them largely organic – with LEGO making up the majority of the interactive items.

Whether strolling through the leafy Shire, or battling orks in the Battle of Helm’s Deep, there’s a real sense of authenticity and scale.

Sometimes, though, the more linear levels fall victim to the camera – making precise movement and jumping sections harder than they need to be.

But this is a small gripe in what is otherwise a fantastic game – a fun-filled classic built for stardom.
