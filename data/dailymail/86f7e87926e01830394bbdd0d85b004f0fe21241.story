A businessman who used profits from laundering millions of pounds for criminals and conned financial institutions to fund a property portfolio and buy a fleet of luxury sports cars has been jailed for six years.

Aqeel Khan acted as a go-to man for criminals across the north of England and was jailed at Leeds Crown Court today after admitting money laundering, possessing a forged bank document and contempt of court.

The National Crime Agency said the 38-year-old, from Bradford, used cash from money laundering and defrauding financial institutions to fund his property investments, including the Old Bus Depot - a well-known Bradford landmark - which he bought for £2.5 million in 2011.

In total, Khan's network had £10 million of property assets, the agency said. The money used to buy the properties had been laundered through multiple bank accounts to try and conceal its source.

Khan and his employee Mohammed Zulqurnain used insurance brokers as fronts for their criminal enterprise, obtaining finance from legitimate financial institutions for non-existent or vastly inflated insurance policies.

The money was then used to buy property and to fund Khan's in a life of luxury, the NCA said. 

Police seized a fleet of his cars which including a Lamborghini, an Aston Martin and a Range Rover.

Police found almost £100,000 that was contaminated with drugs in a cupboard at the home of Ajib Khan

Zulqurnain, 36, today admitted money laundering and fraud and was sentenced to two-and-a-half years jail. He was sentenced along with two other men who were also from Bradford. 

Khan's brother, Atique Anwar Khan, 34, who controlled and coordinated the distribution of cash into third party bank accounts, was given a six month suspended prison sentence.

Another associate, Ajib Khan, 34, who was previously convicted of supplying class A drugs, also admitted laundering money into property. He was given a two year suspended sentence.

The NCA said almost £100,000 of cash contaminated with drugs was seized from Ajib's home.

NCA branch commander David Norris said Khan had 'presented himself' as a successful and wealthy businessman, when in reality he was the head of a 'large-scale, sophisticated money laundering operation'.

Mr Morris said criminal groups relied on people like Khan. 

He said: 'Organised criminals need people who can launder their cash to make it look legitimate and this group provided that service on an industrial scale.'
