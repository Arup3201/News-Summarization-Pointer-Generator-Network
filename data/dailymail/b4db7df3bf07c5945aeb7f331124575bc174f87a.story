John Daly has been sober since 2010, but that hasn't curtailed his exuberant sense of fun - as he proved on Sunday night when he teed-off a golf ball sitting on a tee placed in between a man’s teeth.

Video posted online of the incredible feat of accuracy and skill shows the former wild-man of golf lining up the shot in the parking lot of Soulshine Pizza Factory in Nashville.

The excited crowd sees a brave man lying down on the tarmac while two-time major winner Daly, 47, dressed in sandals, shorts, a red shirt and white Arkansas hat drives the ball clean off the tee, centimeters from his face.

'I walked up and I thought some dude got knocked out because he was lying on the ground. We got a little closer and saw that he had a golf tee in his mouth,' Pearce Harrison, who shared video of the stunt on Instagram, told the New York Daily News.

'He was kind of fumbling around with it for a good three or four minutes, trying to decide if he wanted to do it or not.'

Harrison said that he was visiting the Soulshine Pizza Factory when the crowd gathered round Daly caused him to check out what was going on.

However, some doubt that the video is real and may in fact just be a clever marketing or viral video ploy and the manager at Soulshine said that none of his staff recalled Daly being inside on Sunday.

'I think the ball hit a building across the street because we heard a crack,' said Harrison, a drummer the the band SkyHi said.

'But we went over there to see if it was in the street but didn't find anything.'

Daly famously has endured a checkered career of ups and downs including alcohol abuse and stunning out-of-nowhere wins, leading to him being known as the 'Wild Thing'.

He hasn't had a drink since 2010 and Harrison wanted to confirm this.

'He didn't seem drunk or anything. But everyone around him definitely was.'

While there is no word yet from the man who let Daly smack the ball off his face, Daly does have previous with this kind of stunt.

On David Feherty's show on The Golf Channel, in 2012, the host let Daly hit a ball out of his own mouth, and that seemed to work out just great.
