Microsoft has admitted a bug in its Internet Explorer web browser could leave millions of users vulnerable to hackers.

The firm today issued a fix and urged customers to upgrade their software.

The German government led calls for people to switch their browser in light of the problem.

Hackers could exploit to bug to gain access to a user's PC, and read all of their personal information.

The security flaw affects hundreds of millions of Internet Explorer browser users.

The bug affects the latest version of Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser.

Microsoft said attackers can exploit the bug to infect the PC of somebody who visits a malicious website and then take control of the victim's computer.

The software maker advised customers on its website late on Monday to install the security software as an interim measure, buying it time to fix the bug and release a new, more secure version of Internet Explorer.

The company did not say how long that will take, but several security researchers said they expect the update within a week.

The free security tool, which is known as the Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit, or EMET, is available through Microsoft's website.

Some security experts said it would be too cumbersome for many PC users to implement the measures suggested by Microsoft.

Instead they advised Windows users to temporarily switch from Internet Explorer to rival browsers such as Google Inc's Chrome, Mozilla's Firefox or Opera Software ASA's Opera .

The German government agency overseeing IT safety is also recommending people use other browsers until the problem is fixed.

The browser's "weak point is already being used for targeted attacks," the Federal Office for Information Security warned, adding that the code behind the attack is freely available online and might therefore spread rapidly.

A spokesman for Microsoft Corp. said Tuesday the company is aware of the issue and is working on soon rolling out a software update, a so-called patch, to fix the browser's security features.

'This is not a massive problem.

'There have been only a small number of targeted attacks,' said spokesman Thomas Baumgaertner.

However, he could not provide a figure of the number of attacks recorded so far.

Attackers lure users to an infected website, for example through an emailed link.

Visiting the website then allows hackers to introduce codes to take control of the user's computer, the BSI agency said.

Baumgaertner noted that people should always be vigilant when clicking on links from unknown sources.

He also added that many antivirus programs might already be updated to protect their users against attacks through the browser loophole.Â
