A new poll says Bill Clinton is the most admired president of the last 25 years by a wide margin.

In a Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Annenberg Survey Clinton was named most admired by 42 per cent of respondents.

Coming in second with 18 per cent was Barack Obama, followed by George W. Bush at 17 per cent and George H.W. Bush at 16 per cent.

Former President Bill Clinton was named most admired president of the last 25 years by 42 per cent of recent poll respondents

Following behind Clinton in the poll were current president Barack Obama at 18 per cent and George W. Bush at 17 per cent

The Wall Street Journal reports that 1,238 adults responded to the poll from June 2-8.

There is a margin of error of plus or minus 2.8 per cent.

The Wall Street Journal noted that the poll results were a reflection of how much Clinton had done to polish his image since leaving the White House in 2000.

The survey is part of a series of polls done as a collaboration between the news organizations and the Annenberg Public Policy Center, based at the University of Pennsylvania.

The poll is the latest evidence that the Clinton's are America's most popular political figures at the moment.

That poll along with one supporting Hillary Clinton in a 2016 presidential bid indicate the Clintons are America's most popular political couple

A poll released in May showed that 55 per cent of responders said they would vote for Hillary Clinton as presidential candidate in 2016, the Washington Post reports.

Her support is even higher than Obama's current approval ratings.

Bill Clinton's potential as First Husband seems to help. The Washington Post reported at the time of the survey that his positive ratings were now the best they'd been since the early days of his presidency in the 90s.
