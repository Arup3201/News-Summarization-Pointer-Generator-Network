Cristiano Ronaldo believes he can still improve physically  despite an electric start to the season at Real Madrid where he admitted his pre-season wasn't the best by his own admission.

The 29-year-old was blighted by injuries towards the end of last season that hampered his World Cup with Portugal and the start of this campaign with Real.

Ronaldo was forced to take a three-week break at the beginning of the term as he struggled with a tendonitis in his left knee and a hamstring problem, but has since returned in devastating goalscoring fashion.

His four goal salvo was the third time the forward has achieved the feat at the Spanish giants and he has warned his rivals that now he is pain-free he can only improve.

'I feel good and without any pain. I am still improving and I have a little way to go so I want to continue like this,' he told www.FIFA.com.

'I can still be better physically. I trained really hard during the break after not having a good pre-season, but now I feel confident and without pain.'
