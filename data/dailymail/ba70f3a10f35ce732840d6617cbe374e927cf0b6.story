This is the hilarious moment a dog sounded a car horn for 15 minutes after its owner spent too long in an art gallery.

Fern, an 18-month-old boxer, was filmed leaning back in the driver seat with her left paw resting on the steering wheel and repeatedly pressing the horn on Saturday afternoon.

The animal had been left inside the car while her owner to finish browsing an art gallery in Broughty Ferry, near Dundee in Scotland.

Since being posted online yesterday, the footage of the impatient but 'attention-loving' boxer has been viewed more than 8,000 times.

New trick: Fern's owner Graham Haddow (rear) says that although she regularly climbs into the front seat when left alone in a car, she has never actually used the horn before

Fern's owners Graham and Fiona Haddow, from nearby Liff, say they had only been wandering around the shops in Broughty Ferry for five minutes when they heard the faint sound of a car horn.

At the time they thought little of the noise, and decided to browse the Eduardo Alessandro Studios art gallery.

But after returning to their vehicle 15 minutes later they were shocked to see a large crowd gathered and grew concerned for Fern's welfare.

Mr Haddow, 58, said: 'I came out of the gallery and looked down the street and saw a crowd of people standing around, pointing at my car.'

'I started running because I was worried something had happened to her,' he added.

'When I got closer I realised people were pointing and laughing and taking pictures. She gave me a sideways glance and just kept on going,' Mr Haddow went on.

Mr Haddow, who worked for children's charity Bernardo's before taking early retirement, said a young man on a scooter told him he had been watching Fern blast the car horn for around 15 minutes while he and his wife were looking at works of art in a nearby shop.

Although Fern regularly climbs into the front seat when left alone in a car, she has never actually used the horn before, Mr Haddow said.

Adorable: Fern's new internet-celebrity status comes just a few months after she was fighting for her life after developing meningitis. Thankfully she is now back to her lovable but bossy former self

Mr Haddow is concerned that his beloved pet boxer may repeat her new trick after all the attention it got her the first time around.

'I think she is a bit of a diva. She just wants a bit of
attention and she seems to have gotten her way this time... I might have to put something on the driver’s
seat to stop her doing it again.'

Fern's new internet-celebrity status comes just a few months after she was left fighting for her life after developing meningitis.

The illness is much the same in dogs as it is in humans, with the central nervous system - known as the meninges - becoming inflamed leading to secondary inflammation of the
 brain and spinal cord.

The illness can lead to neurological 
complications - and even death - in both humans and dogs.

Thankfully Fern recovered from the illness shortly after Christmas, and has continued to be the lovable but bossy dog she was before.

'She’s a typical boxer, she’s a bit stubborn, a bit mischievous and very friendly... She’s the best boxer we’ve had - she’s the eighth one in my lifetime,' Mr Haddow said.

'It’s just so amusing to think that Fern has become a bit of a celebrity and she’s completely unaware of it,' he added.
