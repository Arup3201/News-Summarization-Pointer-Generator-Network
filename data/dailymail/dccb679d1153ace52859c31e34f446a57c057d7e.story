Francesca Grillo was a self-confessed ‘eBay addict’ long before her employers took her to court – and even boasted about her love of flashy labels.

In 2005, the younger Grillo sister admitted she had spent £30,000 in just two years on designer products from the auction website and said her shopping addiction was so serious, she ‘needed help’.

Francesca, then 25, said: ‘I was blown away by what you could buy – absolutely anything, from furniture to Fendi bags, vintage clothes to holiday homes.

‘Within a few months, I was hooked. I fell in love with designers such as Marc Jacobs, Prada, Gucci and Moschino.’

She had been working as a housekeeper for Nigella Lawson and Charles Saatchi since 2001, when she joined her sister  Elisabetta, 41, at their Belgravia  property.

Francesca revealed how she became ‘hooked’ on making bids on eBay,  comparing the thrill of winning a bid to ‘driving a Ferrari’.

She said: ‘Then there was the second rush of excitement when I received my purchases. When they arrived, it felt like Christmas.

‘As the months went by, I bought items I didn’t really want simply because I couldn’t bear the thought of anyone else getting them.’

Francesca described how her taste for designer goods led to out-of- control spending.

‘Soon the temptation to blow my budget became too great and I started buying ridiculously expensive items. My biggest splurge was £700 on a pair of Gucci glasses, Fendi boots and a Marc Jacobs scarf – all in one day.’

Francesca claimed that her spending destroyed her relationship with her then boyfriend, who confronted her after finding bags full of expensive gear.

‘He was furious that I was spending money on clothes when I should have been saving up to buy my own flat, and our rows over my spending soon escalated,’ she told the Daily Mail.

‘I never thought he’d make me choose between him and eBay, but in the end he couldn’t take any more.’

Francesca said her passion for eBay developed into a dangerous ‘addiction’ that led to her boyfriend leaving her.

‘Until he left, I didn’t think I had a problem. I reasoned that I didn’t drink, smoke or do drugs. But now I know my eBay addiction was just as strong as someone who is addicted to alcohol or gambling.’

On the surface at least, the contrast between this fashion-filled London  life and the dilapidated streets of Plati, the sisters’ home village in Calabria, could hardly be greater. In the very ‘toe’ of Italy’s ‘boot’, it is a place of cracked roads, unfinished buildings and wandering farm animals.

But there are luxury cars here, too, and high-end handbags, and £500 shoes on the feet of teenage girls despite the many potholes of the  isolated village.

Because there is tremendous wealth in Plati, and it comes from its intimate connection with the feared Calabrian mafia, the ’Ndrangheta, once famous for its kidnappings, now known for supplying drugs.

So while Francesca may blame eBay for her love affair with designer labels, it’s just as likely that the sisters brought their luxurious tastes with them from their home town.

There are fewer than 4,000 residents in Plati, and some 90 per cent are said to have mafia associations, including, according to one police source, three generations of Grillos.

The sisters’ father Michele served 15 years for his part in the gang that snatched Tullia Kauten, a fashion store owner, from the streets of Milan in 1981.

Today Michele insists that he has served his time, is reformed and earns a legitimate living as a truck driver for the construction industry.  He shares a modest flat with his frail wife and their youngest daughter on the outskirts of Milan.

Speaking through the window of his black Mercedes SUV, in his first comments since Elisabetta and Francesca were acquitted of a £685,000 credit card fraud against their former employers, he railed against the threat to their good name.

‘This story has damaged the reputation of my daughters. Good job it went the way it did. I would have seen to it personally, otherwise.

‘My daughters were trapped between two people fighting. Where were all the accountants, what were they doing?

‘If someone spends your money, you get rid of them. The credit cards were in the company name.

‘Why did Nigella keep them working for her for another four years?  I am an honest man. I have a record and have had problems with justice.

But I have my own respectable business. I drive a truck, now. I did not need the money of the English.  I sent money to my girls.

Their bank accounts were frozen and they needed to pay for the lawyers.

‘They will be flying from London to Plati next week and we will spend Christmas all together.’

Local people say Michele, who spent much of Elisabetta and Francesca’s early years in prison, encouraged them to live independent lives.

‘He never wanted them to become involved in the criminal life that has been the lifeblood of the village,’ one woman said.

‘He was determined they would not follow the traditional route of being married off in some arranged dynastic mafia marriage. He encouraged them to travel abroad.’

Elisabetta, who is known as Lisa, was the first to leave. In 1992, she applied for work as an au pair and spent four years in High Barnet, London, before returning to Italy.

In 1999, both sisters sent CVs to a London au pair agency, and Elisabetta ended up as a nanny with  Nigella, who was married to Sunday Times journalist John Diamond, then dying of throat cancer.

Francesca, meanwhile, worked as an au pair with an American family living in Chiswick, West London, before joining her sister in the Saatchi-Lawson household.

Anna Maria, the eldest of the four Grillo girls, remained in Plati, where she married locally. She is currently living in the family’s four-storey house with her extended family of aunts, uncles, nieces and nephews.

Yesterday she expressed her delight at the outcome of the trial and said she was planning a family party to celebrate her sisters’ homecoming. ‘I’m so happy the people on the jury realised it was unfair and found them not guilty,’ she said.  

‘I can’t believe that after my  sisters both sacrificed so much of their own lives to look after Nigella, she turned against them.

‘My sisters were so devoted and worked such long hours that they have not found time for children of their own.

‘As far as I was concerned, they were let down. They are good girls.’

It is likely that the entire village will turn out to welcome its famous former residents.

This notorious criminal hotspot, a centre of the drug trade, might seem a curious destination for Cosima  and Bruno, Nigella’s children with John Diamond.

Yet in the immediate aftermath  of their father’s death from throat cancer, this is where the Grillo  sisters brought them.

‘They took them here to help with the grieving,’ says the sister’s aunt, also called Francesca Grillo.

‘My niece adored those children and they came here a few times. They were like family.’

But after the extraordinary revelations of recent weeks, it seems unlikely they will be returning.

Michele Grillo was sentenced to 18 years in prison for his part in a kidnapping

When fashion store owner Tullia Kauten
 was snatched from the streets of Milan and bundled into the boot of a 
waiting car the  only witness was a barking sausage dog called Kiki.

It was four months before the 43-year-old was freed by the Calabrian mafia, following payment of  a ransom of almost £400,000 .

The
 1981 kidnapping is testament to the terrible efficiency of the 
’Ndrangheta mob. It also offers a colourful insight into the background 
of Elisabetta and Francesco Grillo, whose father Michele was sentenced 
to 18 years in prison for his part in the crime.

At
 the trial of Grillo and 14 others, Ms Kauten explained the appalling 
conditions in which she was held. ‘I was blindfolded and tied to a camp 
bed, and with earplugs,’ she said. ‘The sensory deprivation led to 
hallucinations and depression.’

At
 the time, kidnapping was the scourge of rich Italians and a major 
source of income for the mafia. The Grillos’ home town, Plati, was 
dubbed Italy’s ‘kidnap capital’.

The most famous victim was Paul Getty Jr, heir to one of the biggest fortunes in the world.

Seized
 in Rome in 1973 when he was 16, his ear was chopped off and sent to his
 family to terrorise them into paying a multi-million-pound ransom.

The ’Ndrangheta mob is known these days for its expertise in drug trafficking.

In
 2003, hundreds of police officers stormed Plati, arresting more than 
100 villagers, including the Grillos’ uncle Pasquale. Police uncovered a
 vast labyrinth of underground tunnels, walkways and bunkers, used for 
hiding during raids, and to store and smuggle drugs.

An
 investigation revealed there was a plan to spend public money on 
restoring the tunnels. The town council was dissolved and replaced by a 
special prefectoral commissioner due  to deep mafia infiltration.
