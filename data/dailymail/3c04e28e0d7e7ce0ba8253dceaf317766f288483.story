An Oxford student threw up during an English Language lecture about the origin of the words 'lash' and 'Jagermeister'.

The unfortunately-timed incident sparked an amused reaction yesterday at the 928-year-old university after disrupting the end of an etymology talk.

Professor Charlotte Brewer, an expert on the Oxford English Dictionary, was discussing colloquialisms including 'lord of lash', 'prince of pulls', 'banter' and 'Jägermeister'.

It seemed it was all too much for a female first-year undergraduate, who vomited on the floor. 

Been on the lash? The incident happened as Prof Charlotte Brewer discussed the origins of drinking 'banter'

Aftermath: The scene after the unfortunately-timed incident, which prompted predictable student mirth 

The unidentifed student has since been nicknamed 'chundergraduate' by Oxford student tabloid The Tab.

One English undergraduate told the newspaper: 'It was hilarious because the whole room one-by-one became aware of it like a domino effect.

'She looked horrified and was frantically asking for tissues. I'm not sure if she was hungover or not, but she certainly looked green around the gills.'

The lecturer who was giving the talk, Professor Charlotte Brewer, is an expert on the history of the Oxford English Dictionary and how each edition reflects the time in which it was written. 

Her lecture yesterday afternoon had turned to the origin of words found in the spoof Agony Lad column of The Oxford Student, an undergraduate-led magazine.

The anonymous author describes himself as the 'lord of lash, baron of banter and prince of pulling', adding: 'There are plenty of ladies out there who know me very… intimately.

'If you want to be one of those lucky customers, head to where the drinking is fiercest, follow the smell of Jägermeister, and I’ll be there.'

Sadly for the student journalists, they were unable to establish conclusively whether their fellow undergraduate was hungover or simply ill.

One student added: 'The Agony Lad column isn't sufficiently vile as to cause vomiting.

'She probably just went a bit hard the night before.'
