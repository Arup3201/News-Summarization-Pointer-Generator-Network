Wayne Rooney is now just six strikes shy of equalling Sir Bobby Charlton's England record of 49 goals... but he could be beaten to that mark by own goals!

Since 1879 - when Scottish international Robert Parlane scored the first own goal for England at The Oval - a total of 47 have been gifted to the Three Lions.

And, if own goals were added to the list of England's record scorers, it would sit third behind only Charlton and Gary Lineker (48).

1) Sir Bobby Charlton - 49 goals (106 caps)

2) Gary Lineker - 48 (80 caps)

(Own goals - 47)

3) Jimmy Greaves - 44 (57 caps)

4) Wayne Rooney - 43 (99 caps)

5) Michael Owen - 40 (89 caps)

6) Naf Lofthouse - 30 (33 caps)

=6) Alan Shearer - 30 (63 caps)

=6) Tom Finney - 30 (76 caps)

9) Vivian Woodward - 29 (23 caps)

=9) Frank Lampard - 29 (106 caps)

Jimmy Greaves is next on the list with 44 - now just one ahead of current captain Rooney (43) following the Manchester United striker's fine free-kick against Estonia on Sunday which gave Roy Hodgson's men victory in Tallinn.  

The own goals column only needs to record two further strikes to equal Charlton's record and just three more to reach the half-century milestone.

And, with the most recent of the own goals having come in England's 5-0 demolition of San Marino on Thursday, it is feasible Rooney may not be the first to reach 50.

That own goal - scored by Alex Della Valle - gave the Sammarinese the unwanted title of becoming the first opposition player to score twice for  Three Lions, having previously netted in March 2013.

Despite Rooney crossing the ball, the referee decided that it was a Della Valle own goal against San Marino

Interestingly, Wales have scored the most own goals against England with seven, with the Republic of Ireland and France both scoring at the wrong end four times, as well as Scotland and Northern Ireland with three apiece.

There is just one nation - Japan - who have scored more than one own goal in a single match against England.

That game came in May 2010, when both Marcus Tulio Tanaka and Yuji Nakazawa put into their own net to gift England a 2-1 win.
