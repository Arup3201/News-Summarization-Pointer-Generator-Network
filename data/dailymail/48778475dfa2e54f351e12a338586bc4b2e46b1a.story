Friendly fire? There is speculation over whether border patrol agent Nicolas Ivie, 30, who was shot dead during the shootout was a victim of friendly fire

Questions have been raised over whether a border control agent shot dead was a victim of friendly fire.

Nicholas Ivie, 30, was killed and another agent wounded on Tuesday in Arizona near the U.S.-Mexico line when they responded to a movement sensor which had alerted them to movement along a section of the border known as ‘cocaine alley’.

Now there is speculation that authorities are investigating the possibility that a friendly fire accidental shooting could be what killed Mr Ivie and wounded the other agent.

A third female agent was unharmed in the shooting.

FBI Phoenix would not confirm the possible details according to ABC News, saying in a statement: ‘Due to the sensitive and on-going nature of this investigation, the FBI is unable to provide any further details at this time.’

Forensic reports are being prepared on ballistics and interviews being conducted to shed light on the possibility.

Mexican officials said that they had detained two men who may be connected with the shooting but FBI officials are yet to confirm those arrests but said on Thursday that they were ‘aware of the reporting’.

The Tuscon Sentinel cites a reporter from Fronteras Desk who claimed that two suspects have been detained in Mexico though their identities have not been released.

Agents at the checkpoint declined to comment and barred reporters from going further. Two helicopters from federal immigration agencies could be seen from a distance circling the area. And a fugitive-chase team could be seen staging on a roadside.

Shot at: The agents were fired upon in a rugged hilly area about five miles north of the border as they responded to an alarm that was triggered on one of the sensors installed to alert possible breaches

Cochise County Deputy Chief Rod Rothrock told ABC News affiliate KNXV on Tuesday: ‘Due to the time of day and the location, we suspect some kind of narcotics trafficking, but at this point that is speculative.

‘Cochise County has been a smuggling corridor for many, many years and that seems to be unabated in modern times.

‘The danger zone can extend pretty far north of the border.’

The trio were responding to a tripped movement sensor along the border when there were fired upon in a rugged hilly area about five miles north of the border at 1.50am on Tuesday.

Tight lipped: As agents search for clues, the FBI would not confirm any details 'due to the sensitive and on-going nature of this investigation'

'Smuggling country': Agents from multiple government agencies worked together on the search in the rugged countryside known as a 'smuggling corridor for many, many years'

The U.S. government has put thousands of sensors along the border that, when triggered, alert dispatchers that they should send agents to a particular location.

Mr Ivie is survived by his wife and two children. His family spoke at a press conference on Thursday, describing him as a ‘friend to everybody’ and a ‘favourite uncle’ according to The Tuscon Sentinel.

His brother Rick Ivie said: ‘There was not a bad bone in his body.’

Reeling: This is the first fatal shooting of a border patrol agent since 2010, as the only other deaths have due to car accidents

The other agent, who was shot in the ankle and the buttocks, was airlifted to hospital but has since been released.

President Barack Obama contacted Mr Ivie’s family to express his condolences according to a White House statement.

The statement read: ‘The President told the family they are in his thoughts and prayers and made clear that his administration was doing everything it could to locate those responsible for this tragic event.’

The last Border Patrol agent fatally shot on duty was Brian Terry, who died in a shootout with bandits near the border in December 2010. The Border Patrol station in Naco, where the two agents shot Tuesday were stationed, was recently named after Terry.

Fatal shooting: The station was only recently named after Brian Terry who died during a shootout with bandits in 2010

Terry's shooting was later linked to the government's Fast and Furious gun-smuggling operation, which allowed people suspected of illegally buying guns for others to walk away from gun shops with weapons, rather than be arrested.

Authorities intended to track the guns into Mexico. Two rifles found at the scene of Terry's shooting were bought by a member of the gun-smuggling ring being investigated.

Critics of the operation say any shooting along the border now will raise the question that those illegal weapons are still being used in border violence.
