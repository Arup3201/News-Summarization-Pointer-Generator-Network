Hounded out: Magistrate Yvonne Davies told defendant Christopher Duncan who she was sentencing for growing cannabis that addiction to the drug had led to the death of her own brother

A campaigner for the legalisation of cannabis has boasted of his role in forcing a magistrate to resign.

Peter Reynolds made one of four official complaints about Yvonne Davies, who had highlighted the dangers of the drug when sentencing a dealer.

Judicial officials upheld the complaints – a decision that eventually cost the 65-year-old great grandmother her job on the bench. Cannabis claimed the life of her brother at just 39.

But Mr Reynolds, who has smoked cannabis since turning 14, claimed the magistrate had been scaremongering and the drug was safer than peanuts.

‘She was spreading scare stories about cannabis which are wholly unacceptable,’ he said. ‘There are only small risks with cannabis – it is nowhere near as bad as alcohol.

‘She made the right decision to resign and she has been brought to her senses because she was in an impossible position – she could not dispense justice fairly with such strong views against cannabis.’

Mrs Davies had issued a heartfelt plea to a cannabis grower to mend his ways, describing the devastating case of her brother.

She said she had told of her family’s ordeal ‘hundreds of times’ during her 14 years on the bench.

However, she was officially reprimanded by the Office for Judicial Complaints and said she felt her position became untenable following a ‘back-to-work’ interview in which she was repeatedly asked to resign by senior colleagues.

Mr Reynolds, a divorced former advertising executive, has even encouraged his own children, now 26 and 24, to use cannabis.

In his letter of complaint, he wrote: ‘It is clear that you [Mrs Davies] have suffered a family tragedy and it is possible your brother was one of the tiny minority of people who react badly to cannabis.

‘However, the scientific evidence is that cannabis is very, very safe – much safer than alcohol, tobacco, all prescription drugs, most over-the-counter medicines and even peanuts.’

In the letter, which went to the OJC, the 55-year-old told Mrs Davies to come to ‘her senses’ and stop being ‘biased’.

He wrote: ‘Your conduct in expressing your opinions which diverge so clearly from the facts and evidence is irresponsible, dangerous and entirely unforgiveable. Please issue a public apology and resign.’

Mr Reynolds, who became leader of the pro-cannabis group Clear in 2011, has repeatedly lobbied for users to be able to buy the drug in licensed premises.

‘The harmful aspects of cannabis are 
vastly exaggerated, especially by people like Mrs Davies, and it is only
right that we should put these people right.'

He says he has ‘always been outraged by the law interfering in his life’ and claims legalisation would cut crime.

He said: ‘The harmful aspects of cannabis are vastly exaggerated, especially by people like Mrs Davies, and it is only right that we should put these people right.

‘Cannabis can have many benefits and advocating regulation of it will get rid of the criminals who run the markets at the moment.’

Mr Reynolds, who lives in Weymouth, Dorset, has also encouraged his elderly father to use the drug. The 80-year-old arthritis sufferer rejected his son’s advice because he ‘didn’t want to break the law’.

Last August Mrs Davies, who is a psychotherapist and mental health counsellor, spoke out about her family tragedy while sentencing Christopher Duncan, 55, to 200 hours of unpaid work for growing cannabis.

She said her family went through a ‘living hell’ after her brother Glen Harding died. He developed epilepsy, schizophrenia and depression following years of smoking cannabis and was found dead in a canal in 1997.

Following the hearing – and Mrs Davies’s interviews in local and national media – the OJC launched an investigation into the way she had expressed her personal views on the case.

This was triggered by four complaints including three from retired magistrates – former bench chairman Roger Hall and his two former deputies Barbara Holmes and Pauline Holt.

The retired magistrates used Mr Reynolds’s pro-cannabis arguments when they stated their case against Mrs Davies.

All the complainants asked for Mrs Davies to be removed from her position immediately.

She was suspended but, following a ten-month investigation, the OJC opted only to reprimand her. The decision was signed off by the Lord Chancellor and the Lord Chief Justice.

She stood down on Friday after being asked to resign by a justice clerk and a liaison judge.

She  said she felt ‘disgusted and let down’ by the system and had been ‘pilloried’ for speaking out.

‘It is also doubly astounding that the views of a pro-cannabis campaigner were used to build a case against me. As far as I am aware, cannabis is still very much illegal in Britain,’ she added.

Mrs Davies, who lives with her husband Ernie, 65, in Partington, Greater Manchester, said she  ensured justice had prevailed in all her cases.

‘But I still do not regret speaking out because I felt I was doing the right thing and helping people to stay away from a harmful substance,’ she said.

‘But I don’t regret any of it and I would speak out again about the dangers of using drugs. My brother lost his life because of it and if I can save others from the devastation it causes I will.
