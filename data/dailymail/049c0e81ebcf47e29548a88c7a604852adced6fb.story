A suspected drone pilot has been arrested after a device was flown over a packed football stadium in Manchester, police have said.

The 41-year-old man was held in the car park of an Asda supermarket near Manchester City's Etihad Stadium after reports of a drone flying over a stand during Saturday's match against Tottenham Hotspur.

The man, from the Nottingham area, was arrested on suspicion of breaching the air navigation order and bailed for two months while police make further inquiries.

Greater Manchester Police released a photograph of the small white drone. It was not clear what it was used for.

Chief Inspector Chris Hill said: 'The drones could pose a threat to crowd safety and potentially cause alarm in crowded areas.

'Even small drones can weigh up to seven or eight kilograms and could cause damage or injury if they fall from height. Thankfully, no one was hurt.

'People may see this as a minor offence but it is a breach of the Air Navigation Order which is prosecuted by the Civil Aviation Authority.' 

A drone carrying the contentious issue of Kosovo was flown during Serbia's Euro 2016 qualifier vs Albania

Serbia player Stefan Mitrovic pulled the drone down which led to nasty scenes in Belgrade last week

More than 45,000 people attended the Premier League match, which Manchester City won 4-1.

It comes just a week after a drone carrying a contentious banner caused Serbia's Euro 2016 qualifier with Albania to be abandoned. 

Operating rules for drones - also known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) - state that they must never be flown beyond the normal, unaided line of sight of their operator.

UAVs fitted with cameras must always be flown at least 50 metres away from a person, vehicle, building or structure.

They must not be flown within 150 metres of a congested area or large group of people, such as a sporting event or concert. 

Mitrovic's actions led to a mass brawl between players and fans as the game had to be abandoned 

The Civil Aviation Authority has concluded two cases involving a breach of rules on drone flights this year.

In April, a man became the first person in the UK to be successfully prosecuted for dangerous and illegal flying of an unmanned aircraft. He was fined £800 after flying a device in restricted airspace over a nuclear submarine facility.

In May, another man was fined £300 after he was accused of flying a quadcopter device over a number of rides at theme park Alton Towers in Staffordshire.

The incidents took place in August and November last year respectively.

Magistrates can fine culprits up to £5,000.
