Anyone familiar with New York City in the middle of a heat wave will know it can get pretty sticky and uncomfortable, but imagine if the entire city was moved to the bottom of the Grand Canyon.

Swiss photographer Gus Petro was so inspired after visiting two of the nation’s most iconic locations for the first time that he has chosen to juxtapose them.

His collection of stunning images show what the bustling metropolis would look like if somehow magically relocated into the wide open spaces at the bottom of the great canyon.

Swiss photographer Gus Petro was so inspired after visiting New York and the Grand Canyon that he decided to juxtapose them using camera trickery

Petro has created a stunning collection of images which show what the bustling metropolis of New York would look like if somehow magically relocated into the wide open spaces at the bottom of the Grand Canyon

The images are part of a series that Gus Petro has called 'Empty, Dense, Merge' which explore two opposite feelings through the photos of places located in the U.S.

Petro who visited the country for the first time in late 2012 said he was inspired by the contrast between New York City, where he said ‘it seems like, everyone wants to live’ and the Grand Canyon/Death Valley which are 'unlivable.'

To create the images, Petro took the photographs he had of the two sites, matched their perspective points and lens angles, then put them through a process he calls ‘Photoshop magic.’

He said the most interesting reaction has come from people who have never visited either locale.

‘Most of the people, who haven't been in any of these places, thought it was real,’ Petro told Atlantic Cities. ‘They began questioning me where it is.’
