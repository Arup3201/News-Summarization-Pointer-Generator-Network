A woman in West Yorkshire has been revealed as the worst driving instructor in the country.

The female instructor has achieved only a 15 per cent pass rate over a three-year period - with one of her students failing the practical car driving test a staggering 27 times.

The unnamed woman has prepared candidates for 169 exams in the region, which was recently revealed to be home to the worst learner drivers in the UK.

A whopping 143 of these tests were ‘fails’ – with only 26 learners scoring ‘passes’.

Three other people in West Yorkshire are also ranked among Britain’s top 12 worst driving instructors, according to figures revealed by a Freedom of Information request to the Driving Standards Agency (DSA).

A male instructor in the region has achieved only a 23 per cent rate – less than half the national average of 47.1 per cent.

The unnamed man has recorded just 33 passes out of 145 practical tests between April 2010 and March 2013 – with one student failing the exam a soul-destroying 17 times under his tuition.

Earlier this year, five women in the small West Yorkshire town of Heckmondwike, pictured - which has a population of about 17,000 people - were revealed to be among the top 20 worst learner drivers in the UK

Meanwhile, two other female instructors have each taught an individual who failed their practical driving test an unimaginably high number of times (19 and 17 times respectively). 

Earlier this year, five women in the small West Yorkshire town of Heckmondwike - which has a population of about 17,000 people - were revealed to be among the top 20 worst learner drivers in the UK.

The unnamed women, aged between 35 and 48, had taken a staggering 158 practical driving tests between them - forking out almost £10,000 trying to pass.

One determined woman in the town took 34 attempts to succeed, while two unnamed learners took 32 tests.

The other two women struggled through 29
 practical driving tests before passing on their 30th attempts – 
contributing to the rural town’s extremely low driving pass rate of 39.8
 per cent.

It is believed the women’s lack of success could have been down to Heckmondwike's narrow, rural roads, bad surfaces and busy junctions.

Driving test routes in the area also feature the notorious Gildersome Roundabout, deemed the most dangerous roundabout in the region.

However, four other people in West Yorkshire were also ranked among the top 20 worst learners in the country.

Two learner drivers from Bradford – a man and a woman, both in their 40s - took 30 attempts to pass the practical driving test, while a 29-year-old woman took a slightly more embarrassing 31 exams.

And a 51-year-old female from Horsforth, Leeds, took a pricey 32 attempts to pass.

The practical driving test, which lasts about 40 minutes, costs £62 to take on a weekday or £75 on an evening, weekend or bank holiday.

The DSA says, on average, it takes about 45 hours of professional training and 22 hours of private practice to pass the exam.

A DSA spokesman said: The pass rate of a driving instructor is no reflection of their teaching standard.

'Instructors may not have trained the candidate but only presented them for the test. Others focus on training candidates who have difficulty in learning to drive.

'All registered Approved Driving Instructors (ADI) must pass extensive tests to meet the high standards set by the Driving and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) before giving professional tuition, and are subject to regular checks throughout their career.'

Other unsuccessful driving instructors in the UK include a Hampshire man who has achieved only a 17 per cent pass rate, and a male instructor from Manchester who has seen a student fail 18 practical driving tests under his tuition.
