Beleaguered New Jersey Governor Chris Christie faces a federal probe into the misuse of Superstorm Sandy relief money after his government supervised the funding of a 'Stronger Than The Storm' ad campaign featuring the governor and his family just weeks before his re-election,  it was revealed on Monday.

U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development officials are probing the use of $4.7 million of hurricane rebuilding funds on the self-congratulatory tourism ads.

Christie is already under fire in his home state following revelations that at least four of his aides and political appointees were involved in a scheme to manipulate traffic patterns leading to the massive George Washington Bridge in order to bring gridlock to a New Jersey town as punishment to its mayor, who refused to back Christie's re-election.

Christie himself apologized on 
Thursday for his administration's role in the scandal and fired two 
long-time confidantes, while insisting that he had no involvement in the
 plot and no knowledge of it ahead of time. Two other officials linked 
to the saga resigned in December.

Nearly $5 million in Superstorm Sandy rebuilding funds paid for the 'Stronger Than The Storm' media campaign, which included brief cameos by Christie and members of his family.

At least another $25 million was spent on buying air time for the campaign. [related

 investigators are trying to determine if laws were broken when a 
politically connected advertising firm won the contract to produce the 
ads, despite proposing a budget more than $2 million more than the next 
highest bidder – whose scripts did not include the Christie family.

HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan, an Obama appointee, presides over the agency investigating the Sandy recovery grant -- but he praised Christie's ads at the time they weer first broadcast

East Rutherford, N.J.-based MWW and a subcontractor billed the state $4.7 million to run this year’s campaign. Another firm offered to do it for $2.5 million.

The governor's administration determined how to parcel out the federal dollars once they reached the state capital.

Christie critics in both major parties have complained, including one Democratic rival who has the ear of the Obama administration.]

New Jersey Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone asked HUD's inspector general in August to examine look into how Christie chose to spend the marketing money the federal agency approved.

Pallone told CNN that the IG's preliminary review found enough evidence to mount a more thorough, months-long investigation into whether federal dollars were misused.

A HUD official confirmed that the preliminary investigation took place, but wouldn't discuss its findings with MailOnline.

HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan, however, defended the ads during a November 2013 hearing on Capitol Hill.

The Daily Caller reported that Donovan called his agency's Community Development Block Grant 'a very flexible program.'

The ads, he said, were 'clearly within the legal boundaries of what Congress has determined the program can be used for.'

Christie also attracted slings and arrows from Sen. Rand Paul in November.

The series of ads cost $4.7 million in labor costs and cost-overruns from a politically connected New Jersey firm and its subcontractors, but another company bid $2.5 million

Federal investigators at the Department of Housing and Urban Development want to know if Christie can be held responsible for wasting hurricane relief dollars that could have been spent elsewhere in his state

U.S. Rep. Frank Pallone, a New Jersey Democrat, asked HUD in Washington to look into the legality of using federal disaster relief funds for a Christie promotion stunt instead of rebuilding homes destroyed by Sandy

Apology accepted: Fort Lee, New Jersey Mayor Mark Sokolich was targeted for political retribution with a plot to slow bridge-bound traffic in his town to a crawl

The Kentucky Republican carped to HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan in a Senate hearing that the campaign funded 'ads that included somebody running for political office. I'm thinking there might be a conflict of interest there. That's a real problem. ... when people are trying to do good and trying to use the taxpayer's money wisely, they're offended to see our money spent on political ads. That's just offensive.'

Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican who hopes to be the GOP presidential nominee two years from now, slammed Christie over the ads last year

At the time, the Center for Public Integrity's top watchdog, Bill Buzenberg, told USA Today that Christie's two-second cameos in the TV ads were no big deal.

'I can't say it's unethical,' Buzenberg said, 'because it's not unusual for a governor to be involved in a tourism campaign. When you drive into a state, you see the welcome signs with the governor's picture. The pictures are usually bigger in an election year.'

The George Washington Bridge scandal, dubbed 'Bridgegate' – although 'Tollgate' might be more apropos – is threatening to derail Christie's future political career at a time when he's considering whether to run for president in 2016.

The Deputy Speaker of the New Jersey General Assembly, Democrat John Wisniewski, predicted on Sunday that 'if it becomes known that the governor was involved and he knew about it and he knew about the cover-up, and he was approving the actions taken by his senior staff, that raises serious questions that the assembly ought to look at.'

'And that ought to be considered in light of what our responsibility is. The Assembly has the ability to do articles of impeachment.'

The latest trouble for Christie comes on top of the George Washington Bridge scandal, which already threatens to derail any hope he has of claiming the presidency in 2016
