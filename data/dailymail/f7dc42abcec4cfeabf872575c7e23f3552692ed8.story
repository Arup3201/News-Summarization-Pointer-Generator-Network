Former Liverpool defender Daniel Agger has revealed his differences with manager Brendan Rogers after the pair fell out last season.

Although Agger was named as Liverpool's vice-captain in August 2013, he did not feature for the Anfield club on a regular basis last season.

As a result, the 29-year-old Dane moved back to Brondby in the summer for a fee of £3million.

Agger chats with Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers in training but relations between the two deteriorated 

Agger told Danish programme Onside: 'Let me put it this way, the manager and me were perhaps not on the same page in all of last season. For most of last season at least.

'There was much between us, and for me it was just enough. I felt that he didn't appreciate the things I could and contributed. When I feel that, then it's time to move on.

'Where me and him maybe went wrong from each other, was that I'm very direct. I say things as they are, and so I also expect that people are the same to me. Maybe it's wrong to expect it sometimes.'

Agger left Liverpool this summer after eight years at Anfield and claims he left after differences with Rodgers

After their start to this season, Liverpool could have done with holding on to a centre half like Agger.

They have conceded eight times in their five matches so far but looked particularly ragged in the defeat by West Ham on Saturday.

The Hammers' first goal came from a set-piece and Liverpool look vulnerable to crosses, as well as quick breaks.
