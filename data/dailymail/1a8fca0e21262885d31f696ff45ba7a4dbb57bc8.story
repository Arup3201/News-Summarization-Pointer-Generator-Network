The independent NHS ombudsman is accused of failing countless families who have complained, such as the parents of Sam Morrish, three, who died due to multiple health service failings

Patients who complain to the NHS watchdog in charge of care are wasting their time, a charity warned today.

The Patients Association, a lobby group that aims to improve patients' experience of health care, has declared it has 'no confidence' in the independent NHS ombudsman.

Its role is to investigate complaints over unfair treatment and  poor service that individuals have received from the NHS in England.

Today, the Patients Association released a report into what it claims were failures by the Parliamentary Health Service Ombudsman (PHSO).

It is accused of failing to handle complaints of poor care by families, who they say have been 'let down'. 

The PHSO, the last resort for those complaining about unfair or poor service from the NHS in England, is undergoing a modernisation scheme.

Last month it revealed it had investigated 2,199 cases in 2013/14 - six times more than the previous year.

But Patients Association deputy chief executive Jacqueline Coles, writing in the report, said it had 'failed to adapt' to modern demands.

As a result, it will no longer be referring callers on the charity's helpline to the watchdog.

She said: 'For many years we have advised people who contact our national helpline to go to the PHSO when they have received an unsatisfactory response from their local health service providers.'

'Sadly we can no longer recommend this course of action to patients, as we have no confidence in the PHSO to carry out an independent, fair, open, honest and robust investigation.

'It leaves the victims and families seeking help regarding health concerns cold, alone and frozen out. The PHSO fails them on a regular basis.'

The report cites the case of Sam Morrish, who died in 2010 from a treatable condition due to multiple health service failings.

The three-year-old died 36 hours after his parents first sought medical help for suspected flu and a chest infection.

In that crucial period, they say they experienced a series of shocking blunders from doctors, NHS Direct, an out-of-hours GP service and a hospital.

The mistakes were compounded when the grieving couple asked the NHS to investigate the events leading to Sam’s death from septic shock to prevent future tragedies.

Two initial investigations failed to identify key problems, and Scott and Susanna Morrish said they were forced to relive ‘the life-shattering death’ of their child to get officials to finally act.

In March 2012 the couple complained to the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman (PHSO), the highest authority on NHS complaints. 

But they said officials failed to understand information about the case.

The couple said they persevered in a bid to improve the health service for other patients, including their other sons, now aged nine and two.

But they later said they felt 'failed' by the complaints process after it took four years for the PHSO to publish its findings. 

The Patients Association said Sam’s death exposed ‘catastrophic and systemic’ failings in care and in how the NHS handles complaints.

Chief executive Katherine Murphy said: Our experience of the PHSO has been painful.

'The family wanted organisations to learn so that this would not happen again, but the ombudsman did not want to interview anyone about what went wrong.

'The PHSO is the body which is supposed to hold the NHS to account and set benchmarks but there seems to be a lack of accountability for its own actions.

'The Patients Association helpline has advised hundreds of people to contact the ombudsman but time and time again people have come back to us saying the PHSO has told them there’s nothing more they can do.

'At this point in time I would not advise anyone who came to our helpline to contact the PHSO, because I have no confidence in it. A senior executive within the PHSO told Mr Morrish and I the methodology used in their investigation into our complaints was not fit for purpose.

'It’s time that this organisation was subjected to greater scrutiny. It costs billions at a time when the NHS is struggling. If that money was invested in frontline staff we would have a very different NHS.'

The Patients Association report recommends an overhaul of the ombudsman to improve investigation timescales, contact with patients and a code of practice.

A PHSO spokesman told the BBC: 'We have embarked on a radical modernisation drive which includes listening to feedback from users.

'We are delighted that the Patients Association has agreed to help us draw up a service charter, which will be a set of promises to users about what they can expect when they use our service.'
