An inquisitive bird hit the headlines when it flew into a busy TV studio and perched itself - next to a newsreader.

Regional BBC presenter Alison Johns was in the middle of a live breakfast bulletin when the feathered visitor landed on a monitor just behind her.

The bird, believed to be a wren, remained in shot for several seconds before Ms Johns handed over to the weather forecast.

This is the moment viewers of a live BBC news bulletin were sent in to a flap when a bird (ringed) flew into the studio and landed on a monitor

The TV anchor had no idea it was right behind her but as soon as she was off air staff captured the creature and carefully released it into the wild.

Ms Johns, a reporter and presenter for West Country-based BBC Spotlight, tweeted a still of the bird afterwards, saying: 'Unexpected guest with me in @BBCSpotlight studio this morning!'

Amused viewers left comments about the episode on the programme's Facebook page.

Stuart Billinghurst asked: 'Did I see a little bird sat on the top of the studio tv on the 7:50 update?

Another viewer, Katie Lyle, added: 'I was sure I saw a bird earlier. I thought I was seeing things.'

Les King added: 'Classic Robin shape that is.' 

The incident on the BBC South West Breakfast bulletin happened just as presenter Alison Johns was handing over to the weather forecast
