Fresh violence in Egypt and Libya does not mean the Arab Spring is over, David Cameron will say today.

In a speech to the United Nations, the Prime Minister will express optimism about the changes in Middle Eastern governments despite warnings that  Islamic fanatics could take over.

Mr Cameron is said to be impressed by the start made by Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi, despite his background in the shadowy Muslim Brotherhood.

Thoughts: Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured yesterday in New York, will say today that fresh violence in Egypt and Libya does not mean the Arab Spring is over

‘Of course everyone has concerns and worries as we see these elections take place and people who have got quite Islamist backgrounds get elected,’ said a source.

‘But the Prime Minister’s view is that we should judge people by what they do and Morsi has made an impressive start. The PM still thinks the Arab Spring is working.’

Following the UN session, Mr Cameron will make a high-risk appearance on David Letterman’s Late Show. The Prime Minister is hoping to use the prime time TV appearance to promote British business in America after the Olympics.

But Letterman is famed for his biting wit – once asking Boris Johnson when he stopped cutting his own hair – and Mr Cameron is braced for questions about his aristocratic connections and his chief whip’s problems with the police. Mr Cameron knows all about the perils of talk shows. In 2006, he was asked by Jonathan Ross whether as a teenager he had sexual fantasies about Margaret Thatcher.

Today, he will tell Mr Morsi that he will send officials to Brussels to help Egypt cut through EU red tape that makes it difficult for frozen assets to be returned to their rightful owners. About £100million in property and assets is thought to be tied up in London.

Cairo has accused the UK of foot-dragging over the issue. Not a penny has been returned to Egypt so far.

Assets include a number of central London properties, including a £10million house near Harrods that is closely linked to former President Mubarak’s son Gamal.

In a further show of friendship, government sources last night said the Chief of the Defence Staff General Sir David Richards would be dispatched to Cairo this autumn to advise on cracking down on a militant uprising in Sinai. Mr Cameron is also expected to issue a strongly worded warning about the damage being caused to the UN by its failure to tackle the bloodshed in Syria.

The Prime Minister will start tweeting next month – even though he has previously been rude about users of the blogging service.

Using his new personal account, Mr Cameron will be able to launch party political attacks. In 2009 he said there was a danger ‘too many tweets might make you a tw*t’.
