Eight out of ten families are being pestered with nuisance phone calls from PPI and claims management firms, according to industry watchdogs.

The shocking figures have prompted demands for a ban on any cold calling by PPI firms or others offering financial services.

Figures published by the telecom watchdog, Ofcom, found 82 per cent of people are getting an average of 2.4 nuisance calls every week.

More than one in five of these - 22 per cent - were related to claims management firms trying to drum up a list of clients who could make a claim for mis-sold Payment Protection Insurance.

Another one in 10 related to companies promoting the idea that cash-strapped Britons may be able to release money early from their pensions.

Ofcom signalled that it, along with the Ministry of Justice and the Information Commissioner’s Office, is investigating a number of the firms involved with a view to handing down six-figure fines.

However, Citizens Advice said the nuisance and distress has now reached the point that the authorities must take action to ban any cold calling of this type.

Its chief executive, Gillian Guy, said: ‘People are being hounded in their homes by unscrupulous financial firms. 

‘Without a ban on cold calling for financial services, people are at risk of losing some of their pension to scams or paying upfront fees for services that don’t deliver.

‘A ban on cold calling will make it clear that if you are still contacted out of the blue then it is a scam or a service not to be trusted.’

Richard Lloyd of Which? said: ‘Ofcom's shocking findings reflect our own research and show just how many of us are being bombarded by the menace of unwanted calls and texts.’

He said the various bodies responsible for policing the phone and financial services system need to ‘get tough’ and hit the people responsible with heavy fines.

Ofcom said the majority of unwanted calls were considered ‘annoying’ by 86 per cent of people it surveyed. Seven per cent of nuisance calls were considered ‘worrying’, while three per cent were ‘distressing’.

Ofcom’s Consumer Group Director, Claudio Pollack, said: ‘Two nuisance calls a week is too many and this detailed research will help us understand the root cause of the problem.

‘We will use the full range of our powers to tackle abandoned and silent calls, but this is a complex area that requires joint action from a number of different agencies and Government.

‘We are therefore working with the Government and other regulators to help drive a co-ordinated and more effective response to nuisance calls.’

In theory, people can have their telephone numbers removed from the lists used by marketing companies as the basis of their cold calls. This involves contacting the Telephone Preference Service (TPS) via its website.

John Mitchison, the head of the service, said: ‘The TPS has seen a significant increase in the number of complaints received over the past six months. Although Ofcom’s latest findings on nuisance calls are not at all unexpected, 82 per cent is slightly higher than previously reported figures.

‘Unsolicited phone calls can be annoying and cause distress to people. Most of these calls are not made by reputable companies, which is why the TPS has been urging the regulators for more enforcement action against companies operating outside of the law for the past 18 months.

‘It’s the responsibility of the regulators to use enforcement action to protect the consumer, as well as the interests of the vast majority of companies that comply with the law.’
