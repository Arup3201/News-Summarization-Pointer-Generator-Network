Hundreds of mourners turned out for an opulent gypsy funeral complete with mirrored coffin, horse-drawn hearse and a cortege of pink limos and hummers.

Friends and family packed the church and spilled out on to the street as more than 600 paid their respects to Kathleen Morrison, who died of cancer at just 33 years old.

The resplendent funeral procession was led by six white horses with pink plumes on their heads, pulling a white wood and glass carriage.

Grand send-off: A hot pink Hummer and two pink stretch limos carried close family to the church

Ms Morrison’s coffin - finished with white gloss, metal and mirrored panels - was carried into the church by six pall bearers dressed in pink shirts and black ties.

Floral tributes filled St Francis of Assisi’s Catholic Church in Beeston, Leeds, during yesterday's service.

The hearse was followed by  two pink limos and a pink stretch Hummer carrying close family, with five flatbed trucks covered in flowers bringing up the rear.

Many of the elaborate wreaths were in the shape of hearts and stars, while the more unusual arrangements depicted cameras, handbags and at least one caravan, picked out in silver and pink.

The pink theme was carried on in the clothing of many of the mourners, some of whom wore pink T-shirts with Ms Morrison’s picture on them along with the legend 'RIP'.

Other travellers at the funeral wore pink shoes, tops or flowers in their hair.

The mother-of-three worked for the Leeds Gypsy and Traveller Exchange and was considered an ambassador for the travelling community.

Growing up among a large group of family and friends, she lived in different areas in and around Leeds, before returning to live in her caravan at her mother’s home at Cottingley Springs caravan site on the south-west edge of the city when she became ill.

She died at home last Tuesday, surrounded by her family, six months after receiving a diagnosis of cancer.

Inspiring: Ms Morrison's colleagues said working with her was like 'a magic carpet ride'

Father Bob Owens, leading the mass, said: 'Kathleen hated unfairness and injustice and a lot of her work was to give young people the power to do different, exciting and interesting things and to have the same chances as children and young people in other communities.'

Ms Morrison’s colleagues from GATE said that working with her 'was often like a magic carpet ride, with them hanging on the fringes, a bit scary but so exciting'.

Speaking from notes given to him by her family, Father Owens said: 'Kathleen was a very loyal person, whenever you were in trouble or needed a friend she was always there.'

She leaves her husband Jonboy, two sons aged 14 and 13, a three-year-old daughter and her mother, an Irish traveller.
