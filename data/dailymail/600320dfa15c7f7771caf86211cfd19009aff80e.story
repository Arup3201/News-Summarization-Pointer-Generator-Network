A couple who yearned to adopt a baby for years have finally realized their dream - with the help of Facebook.

John and Kristen Juth, from Gahanna, Ohio, had many heartbreaking, failed attempts with fertility treatments and a surrogate when an adoption attorney made a surprise suggestion. 

Tommy Taneff, an adoption attorney in Columbus, told them to turn to social media as 'no one has a more vested interest than the couple in finding their baby'.

The lawyer suggested that his clients post regular messages on their Facebook profiles making it clear they wanted to adopt or else set up a page dedicated to their potential adoptions.

Far from just being a tool for sharing vacation photos or organizing a birthday bash, Facebook has taken on a vital role for people desperate to adopt.

There is little data available to measure the rise in the phenomenon but Thomas Taneff, who runs a small firm in Columbus, Ohio, said that he has helped 75 couples or individuals adopt with help from the social network in the past three years alone.

The National Adoption Foundation, which helps families across the U.S. with the adoption process, advocates using Facebook to set up a fundraising page.

Last month, a http://www.tucsonnewsnow.com/story/23141584/adoption-over-facebook-adds-to-ohio-family put a couple's unborn Down Syndrome baby up for adoption on Facebook and received 900 responses from families wanting to raise the child within 24 hours. 

The flood of offers came from all over the U.S. and across the globe including from England, Puerto Rico and the Netherlands.

The parents later interviewed three of those families with an adoption agency.

He tells clients to regularly change their posts about adoption, using key search terms such as 'looking for a baby'; 'help us find a birth mother'; 'pregnant teenager'; and 'help us become a family'.

Mr Taneff told MailOnline today that he encourages potential parents to post pictures regularly, giving an insight into their life - their home, pets, extended family and vacations.

He then advises adding a link to a fuller profile about the couple or individual.

He said: 'No adoption agency or lawyer, who can be looking after hundreds of people, will ever be as vested in finding a baby for a couple as the couple themselves.

'My advice is don't wait for the lawyers or agencies - network with your family, friends, co-workers.

'It is faster and its cheaper when you're proactive.'

The story ended happily for the Juths, who told Tucson News, that on June 30 they adopted a baby girl called Madison Ellen.

The child's birth mother had found the couple via their Facebook page.

Mrs Juth said Madison 'is literally the love of our life'.

Mr Taneff, who has around 100 adoption
cases at his practice, said that the Ruths had several leads within six
months of using Facebook.

He
said that in general, the time taken for couples to adopt 
has drop from two to three years to between six and 12 months with the help of social
media.

The attorney 
said that 75 of his clients have found babies by using Facebook to help with their
adoptions.

However, the lawyer explains, there are always some expected risks.

Mr Taneff said: 'I tell prospective parents that
if someone approaches you and the first thing they say is ''money'', 
then don't walk away - run.

'The same thing if someone claiming to be a birth mother approaches and says ''I 
don't want to talk to your lawyer.'''

Although Mr Taneff has seen a leap in 
the number of initial introductions to adoptions being made on Facebook,
he then completes all the necessary assessments and paperwork to make 
the adoption legal.

MailOnline was awaiting a response from Facebook.
