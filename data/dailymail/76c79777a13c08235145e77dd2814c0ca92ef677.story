An increase in suspected Russian spying activity is raising fears of a return to the Soviet-style espionage seen in the Cold War.

In Poland a high-ranking military officer was recently arrested for spying while in the  Czech Republic, security services warn of a rise in the number of foreign intelligence officers operating out of Prague's embassies.

Their concerns were shared around Europe on Wednesday after 26 Russian bombers, tankers and fighter jets on military exercises were intercepted across the continent in just 24 hours.

And yesterday, RAF Typhoons intercepted a Russian Bear bomber again as it approached UK airspace in a manoeuvre similar to that witnessed earlier in the week.

Espionage incident: Spy agency officers in Poland escort a man suspected of spying in front of the district court in Warsaw last month

An RAF spokesman said the Russian aircraft was picked up by the RAF Control and Reporting Centre at Boulmer in Northumberland,

She added: 'Following a similar incident on Wednesday October 29, the RAF Typhoon pilots visually identified the Russian aircraft and escorted them through the UK flight information region.'

The extraordinary incidents follow months of heightened tensions between Moscow and the West following Russia's annexation of Crimea and military incursion into Ukraine.

In Poland a high-ranking military officer was recently accused of passing information to Russian security forces. 

Officers from Poland's domestic security agency, ABW, descended on the country's defence ministry in Warsaw to arrest the lieutenant-colonel.

A lawyer, with contacts throughout Polish government, was also taken into custody on spying charges, The Financial Times reports.

Sending a message: One Polish MP said the arrests were intended to show Russian security forces that Poland should not be seen as an easy target for obtaining intelligence on EU or Nato strategy

Gromoslaw Czempinski, a former head of Poland's security service, said: 'Activity is higher, for certain. It is to be expected. 

'There is tension between Russia and Europe, and they would obviously like to know much more about sanctions, relations between countries.'

One  Polish MP said the arrests were intended to send a message to Russian security forces - that Poland should not be seen as an easy target for obtaining intelligence on EU or Nato strategy.

Piotr Niemczyk, a former deputy director of the Polish intelligence services, told the Financial Times: 'We do not want this kind of spying activity in Warsaw. We want to show that we will not tolerate it. This is the point of the game.' 

This week it was also claimed that the Russian government was behind a series of cyber attacks on Polish government ministries - an allegation Moscow has denied.

The Czech secret service has also warned that Russia placed an 'extremely high' number of intelligence officers at its Prague embassy in 2013 - in a bif to increase its influence in the country.

On Wednesday, Russia sent 26 bombers, tankers and fighter jets on military exercises around Europe - sparking widespread concern. 

Jets were scrambled by the RAF and allies in Germany, Portugal and Turkey after the 'unusual' spike in activity, which saw two giant Tu-95 Bear H bombers fly close to Britain yesterday.

Nato said Russia had conducted 'significant military manoeuvres in European airspace' - though it then added none of the planes had strayed into any specific country's territory. 

British Typhoon pilots identified Russian Bear bombers visually and 'escorted' them around the edge of British airspace, a Ministry of Defence spokesman said.

The Bears then continued towards the Atlantic to the west of Portugal, where they were intercepted by Portuguese F-16s before turning back. 

In 2010 11 people were arrested by the FBI and accused of spying for Russia. The group was accused of using invisible ink, short-wave radios, steganography and wi-fi in cafés to pass coded messages back to Russia - including information on nuclear weapons.
