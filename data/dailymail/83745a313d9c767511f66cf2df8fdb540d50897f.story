Jailed: Janine Pickett, 46, plundered customer deposits and rental payments from bank accounts

A businesswoman who led the high life after stealing £375,000 from clients was jailed today.

Janine Pickett, 46, plundered customer deposits and rental payments from bank accounts she managed as the franchisee of Dorset Lettings.

She used the money to buy several Welsh ponies - one of which cost £7,000 - bought a new BMW on hire purchase, and took several exotic holidays, including trips to Florida, France and cruises around the Mediterranean.

Today Pickett, of Gillingham, Dorset, was sent to prison for 32 months by a judge at Dorchester Crown Court after earlier pleading guilty to a charge of fraud by abuse of position.

The court heard that between January 2010 and November 2013 Pickett helped herself to the money from the Shaftesbury-based business.

Further investigations revealed that Pickett had altered documents including bank statements and financial audit records in an attempt to cover up the theft.

Detective Constable Declan Cummings, of Dorset Police, said: ‘Janine Pickett’s selfish actions have had a significant impact on a large number of people.

'Not only the innocent customers who handed over their deposits and rent in good faith, but also Barrie George, who is the owner of the Dorset Lettings brand.

‘He runs three of the six businesses himself and the remaining three are franchised. I hope the sentence handed out today sends a very strong message that crimes such as this will not be tolerated in Dorset.’

Mr George said: ‘On behalf of everyone at Dorset Lettings including the staff, landlords, tenants and suppliers, it is gratifying to see that justice has been served.

‘It has been a particularly stressful time for everybody and hopefully the conclusion of the legal case will help bring closure for all those directly affected.

‘Fortunately, Dorset Lettings is an ethical Arla-licensed agent and client money protection insurance is a condition of the licence.

‘We were able to make claims on behalf of all the landlords involved and facilitated the claims for tenants to get their deposits back.

‘We responded quickly to this crisis and I would like to pay tribute to all the staff who worked tirelessly under the most trying circumstances to help our customers. We continue to go from strength to strength.’

Pickett was well known in the show horse world, having regularly competed at the Gillingham & Shaftesbury, Bath & West and the Dorset and Devon county shows.
