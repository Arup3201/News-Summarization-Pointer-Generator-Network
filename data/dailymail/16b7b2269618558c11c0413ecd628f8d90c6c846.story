A stork launches a dirty bomb at a flying sparrow - scoring a direct hit with its own faeces.

The startled little bird is seen flying beneath the stork's nest, only to get lashings of poo on its head.

The sparrow was sent spiralling off course by the blast but soon recovered and escaped.

A stork defecates on a sparrow from its nest in Lubbecke, Germany and hits it right on target

Photographer Martin Nobbe, from Lubbecke, Germany, managed to capture the hilarious moment.

Mr Nobbe said a family of sparrows had been sharing the stork's nest as 'subtenants' until things turned ugly.

One of the three storks chose the exact moment the unsuspecting swallow passed under its nest to do a number two - and the poor swallow got it right on the head.

If the sparrow had flown by just a few seconds later the kamikaze toilet attack would have been avoided

A long white stream of bird poo can be seen headed directly for the tiny sparrow - and if it had flown by just a few seconds later the kamikaze toilet attack would have been avoided.

Mr Nobbe said: 'The little sparrow who was hit could fly unharmed afterwards - but he must certainly have learned a lesson.'
