Tony Abbott's prime ministership is once again on shaky ground, with his potential rivals forced to insist they are not moving against his leadership.  

Both Malcolm Turnbull and Julie Bishop weighed in on leadership rumblings on Friday morning after reports indicated Mr Turnbull now has the votes to seize the Liberal leadership.

Mr Turnbull has won over many of his detractors on the front bench in a series of private dinners in recent weeks, according to political commentator David Speers. 

The Communications Minister told reporters this morning that he would not 'fuel' leadership speculation, adding that he had not been calling his colleagues overnight.

'Has the numbers': Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull has not moved to challenge the Prime Minister for his leadership

Mr Abbott has dismissed the leadership speculation as 'Canberra nonsense', while Ms Bishop (right) said she wasn't making calls

Ms Bishop was more direct. 'I'm not doing the numbers,' she said in an interview with Fairfax Media. 

'The media are obviously ringing backbenchers, I am not and if I were I think people would know that in a heart beat. I'm not doing the numbers.' 

At a press conference this morning, Mr Abbott dismissed the frenzy as 'Canberra insider nonsense'.

But Speers wrote that Mr Turnbull has rapidly improved his reputation among frontbenchers since the leadership vote earlier this month. 

'Over private dinners he's reached out to those nervous about putting him back into the top job, particularly those on the frontbench who until now have been loyal to Tony Abbott,' Speers wrote.

'No portfolios have been offered and no support has been directly canvassed. But Turnbull has discussed frankly the challenges confronting the Government with senior and junior ministers.'

Mr Abbott defeated a backbencher-led spill motion by 61 votes to 39 earlier this month. No other Liberal contested the leadership.  

'Backbenchers are reluctant to bring on another grassroots motion to spill the leadership,' Speers said. 'They want a delegation of ministers to do the deed this time.'

Mr Turnbull was widely touted as a potential candidate if a leadership spill motion went ahead earlier this month

Mr Turnbull has remained publicly loyal to Mr Abbott's government but has distanced himself from some of his decisions in recent weeks. 

He heaped praise on the 'distinguished' head of the Human Rights Commission, Gillian Triggs, earlier this week after Mr Abbott and senior ministers publicly blasted her leadership. 

Mr Turnbull has also described a number of Prime Minister Tony Abbott's unpopular decisions - such as the knighting of Prince Philip and dumping of chief government whip Phillip Ruddock - as 'captain's calls'.
