Loveable: Old English sheepdog, Gair, on the set of a Dulux advert

The loveable sheepdog breed used to advertise Dulux and the corgis famously favoured by the Queen are at risk of extinction.

Only 316 old English sheepdog puppies have been registered with the Kennel Club this year, while less than 450 offspring of the historic Pembroke Welsh corgi breed have been confirmed.

The Kennel Club has placed them on its list of endangered breeds, along with 30 others including the wheaten terrier and Welsh terrier.

Sharon Tolliday, an old English sheepdog breeder from Suffolk, told The Sunday Times a 'misapprehension' that the breed is 'high maintenance' and the public's preference for smaller dogs has led to its decline.

She added: 'When Dulux adverts originally came out we were inundated. They were very popular but their popularity had dwindled.'

The shaggy-haired breed was first used by the paint company in Australia in the Sixties before being introduced to advertising campaigns in the UK.

The first dog to hold the role was Shepton Dash, who starred in the ads for eight years.

Pembroke Welsh corgis have been a Royal Family favourite for more than 70 years, with the Queen owning 16 of the famous herding dog.

The Kennel Club will be releasing its watchlist this week, ahead of its Discover Dogs exhibition in London next month to encourage people to choose the vulnerable breeds.

Kennel Club secretary Caroline Kisko said: 'People often go for the most obvious or fashionable dog choice, which isn't necessarily the right one for them.'

Breeds already listed by the Kennel Club of being at risk of extinction including the Irish red and white setter, English setter, Manchester terrier, Lancashire heeler and the Otterhound.
