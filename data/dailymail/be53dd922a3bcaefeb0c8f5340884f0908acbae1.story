Agents from Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) have caught the woman suspected of producing child pornography and appearing to abuse a young child in a sex video she posted on the internet - less than 24 hours after the Feds appealed to the American public for help.

Corrine Danielle Motley of Okaloosa County, Florida was arrested late Wednesday and faces federal charges for the production and distribution of child pornography.

The 25-year-old was apprehended by Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force members and Homeland Security Investigations special agents.

Tip: Agents said that after they asked the public for help, they were able to catch the woman in less than 24 hours

Suspect: According to her Facebook page the woman is married to Brandon (right)

A Facebook page for the suspect shows that the woman is married to Brandon and in photos she poses with various young children.

U.S. Immigration and Customs were alerted after a video appeared on the internet showing the woman engaging in explicit sex with a four to five-year-old victim.

They issued an appeal on Wednesday morning for help in finding the woman in the footage, believed to have been uploaded on or around November 27.

'The quick identification of the victim and suspect in this case demonstrates the power of the press, social media and the general public in helping solve these cases,' John Morton, director of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE), told ABC News.

'Literally hours after we asked the public for their assistance in identifying Jane Doe, a tip came in that led to her identification and arrest. There is nothing more satisfying than knowing that, due to these efforts, a child is now safe and her tormentor now in custody.'

She is being held without bond.Â 

Help: HSI agents released this image from the explicit video (left) and members of the public helped them identify the woman as 25-year-old Corrine Danielle Motley (right)

The woman was described as being of medium build with hazel or green eyes and brown hair with blond highlights. She has a mole on her left thigh and a tongue piercing with a white round stud with a pink dot.

It is believed the video was made in the U.S. and that both victim and abuser are in the country.

Investigators from Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) Homeland Security Investigation team received a tip-off about the film from Danish Police.

A criminal complaint and arrest warrant has been issued in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.

Footage in which they appeared was submitted to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, the national clearinghouse for child sexual exploitation material.

Anyone with information about the latest abuser or her victim should contact the agency immediately by calling the ICE Tip Line on 866-347-2423, which is staffed 24-hours a day, or filling out an on-line tip form at www.ice.gov.

The HSI are hoping to build on the success of a similar appeal earlier this year which led to two arrests and the rescue of two children.

Michael Serapis Freeman, 39, and Michelle Lee Freeman, 40, surrendered to police at their home in Salem, Oregon after learning an acquaintance had identified Michelle from a photo circulated the HSI.

Warped: The 'Jane Doe' abuser is believed to be between 23 and 29. She was filmed engaging in explicit sex with a four-to-five year-old victim

Appeal: The woman is of medium build with hazel or green eyes and brown hair with blond highlights. She has a mole on her left thigh and a tongue piercing with a white round stud with a pink dot

Previously
 only identified as 'Jane Doe,' Michelle Freeman's picture was extracted
 from video and photos allegedly showing her victimizing the two girls, 
Homeland Security Investigators said.

The
 ICE Homeland Security Investigations is responsible for investigating 
crime connected to the illegal movement of goods and people into and out
 of the United States.

Agents target criminal networks smuggling people and drugs across America's borders.

It has 6,700 agents spread throughout 200 American cities and 47 overseas outposts.

Michael Freeman admitted to taking 
nude photos of his 9-year-old daughter while performing sexual acts on 
her to the witness of his 6-year-old daughter.

He described himself having been in a 'bad place' when manufacturing the content and trading it on a photo sharing website.

A
 scan of that website by the MailOnline shows lists of users providing 
photos of young boys and girls, many described being under the age of 
18, in provocative poses coupled with similarly fueled comments.

Michael Freeman said he engaged in this file swapping of his daughter with another user for approximately one month.

Caught:  Michael Freeman, 39, and Michelle Lee 
Freeman, 40, surrendered to police after learning an acquaintance had 
identified Michelle in photos released by the U.S. Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement (ICE) in August
