The International Cricket Council has admitted it 'does not have the power to intervene' in the high-stakes dispute between the West Indies Cricket Board and the Board of Control for Cricket in India.

The very future of the West Indies national side is up in the air following the squad's premature abandonment of their three-format tour of India - a momentous decision that led to the BCCI initiating legal action against the WICB and suspending all future tour agreements between the teams.

With the financial fragility of the WICB - particularly compared to the commercial behemoth that is Indian cricket - either a multi-million dollar claim for damages or the loss in revenue associated with Indian visits could effectively bury the West Indies as a going concern.

But as a result of a controversial governance restructure earlier this year - when the boards of India, England and Australia effectively seized executive control - the ICC has no jurisdiction over the future tours programme.

As a result, the ICC confirmed on Wednesday that despite concerns over the row - which is rooted in an internal payment dispute between the Windies squad, their players' association WIPA and the WICB - they have no formal powers of mediation.

A statement released to Press Association Sport read: 'The International Cricket Council (ICC) said on Wednesday it was concerned with the dispute between the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB), and was closely monitoring the developments arising from the recently cancelled tour of India.

'The ICC hopes that the matter will be resolved amicably, but clarified that, unless the matter is otherwise referred to it, it does not have the power to intervene in disputes resulting from a bilateral FTP tour.

'The ICC added that the matter will be discussed at the ICC Board meeting, which is scheduled for 10 November in Dubai. Until then, the ICC will make no further comment on this matter.'
