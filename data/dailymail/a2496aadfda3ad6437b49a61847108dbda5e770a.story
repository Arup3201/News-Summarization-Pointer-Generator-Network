This could cause a rumble between two of TV's best friends - a survey has revealed women fancy Dec more than Ant.

Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly, both 37, have become familiar faces on television screens since they found fame on BBC children's show Byker Grove and have hosted some of the country's biggest shows including Britain's Got Talent.

The pair, who also had a music career as rapping duo PJ and Duncan, recently made it to number one after fans rushed to buy their 1994 hit Let's Get Ready To Rhumble after they performed the track on their Saturday Night Takeaway show.

The majority of woman fancy Ant more than Dec with more than three quarters believing Ant would make the best friend

The survey revealed 72 per cent of the nation's women believe Dec would perform best in the bedroom, with one woman saying she thought he would be a 'tiger between the sheets'.

The research, which saw 4,000 women questioned, found more than three quarters thought Ant would make the best friend with 81 per cent saying they would rather share a cup of tea and a chat with him.

When asked to choose their overall favourite between the TV duo, Dec was the ultimate winner, just pipping his pal to the post with 54% of the vote.

Phil Dorrell, brand manager at Sweet'N Low which commissioned the poll, said: 'Ant and Dec are well on their way to becoming national treasures, so it was interesting to see which of the two was the UK's favourite.

'Though Ant was a popular choice, it seems that British housewives ultimately wanted to see Dec on top.'

Ant and Lisa Armstrong have been married since 2005 while Dec is rumoured to be dating Pussycat Doll Ashley Roberts
