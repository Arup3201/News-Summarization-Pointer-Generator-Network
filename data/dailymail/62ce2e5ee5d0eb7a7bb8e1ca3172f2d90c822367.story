An Ohio woman who has admitted voting for President Obama twice in last year's election is now being investigated for casting a total of six ballots.

Melowese Richardson, who lives in Cincinnati, told a local television station that she voted as an 'absentee' as well as at the polling station because she ‘certainly wanted my vote to count.’

But authorities are now concerned the grandmother may have voted six times using the names of other people in Hamilton County.

Early and often? Melowese Richardson told a local Cincinnati news station that she voted twice for Obama during the November elections

Richardson, a veteran poll worker of 25 years, told Cincinnati station WCPO-TV, that she voted twice for President Obama at the polls in November.

‘I, after registering thousands of people, certainly wanted my vote to count, so I voted,’ she said.

The Hamilton County Board of Election’s director, Amy Searcy, told MailOnline that a certain amount of ‘anomalies’ pop up during every election. This year, she said, there were more than 80.

‘As we nailed down the anomalies, some required further information,’ she explained, adding that some refused to return phone calls or answer subpoenas. 

Ms Searcy said that she was not allowed to publically comment on the board’s on-going investigation, but said that they could make a ruling by Friday, their next board meeting.

‘The law requires us to report the facts the prosecutor’s office for further investigation and to Jon Husted, the Ohio secretary of state,’ she said.

But Fox News reported that three other absentee ballots in the names of different people were submitted to the Board of Elections from Richardson's address on Nov. 1.

It is claimed that the handwriting on those ballots is similar and that they were all received together - and on the same day that Richardson's absentee ballot arrived at the office.

Richardson, who says the other voters live at her house, told the local station that the votes were 'absolutely legal votes'.

The longtime poll worker said: ‘There was absolutely no intent on my part to commit any voter fraud,’ according to Fox News.

Richardson said that she thought she 
sent an absentee ballot but was afraid it would not be counted, so she 
went to a polling site in-person to cast her vote.

Jon Husted, Ohio’s secretary of state, told the conservative news channel that Richardson ‘appears to have used her position as a poll worker to cover her tracks.’

Mr Hustead told Fox News that he was especially troubled ‘because it is my responsibility to make sure the system runs effectively, that it has integrity.’

The secretary of state had controversially attempted to restrict early voting on the last three days before the November 6 election.

He was rebuffed by a Supreme Court ruling, though his attempted restriction caused plenty of confusion at the polls.

Mr Obama won the popular vote in the Buckeye State with 2,827,621 votes to former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney’s 2,661,407, winning 50.7 percent of the popular vote, and 332 Electoral College votes to Mr Romney’s 206.

It is a well-known fact that no Republican presidential candidate has won the election without first winning the state of Ohio.
