A college freshman died after he fell from a 20-foot cooling tower he was climbing on a dormitory roof.

Michael Anderson, 19, was a student at the University of Arizona. Campus police say the fall appears to be an accident.

Anderson and another student scaled an exterior wall of three-story Colonia de la Paz Residence Hall before 4 a.m. Friday to get to the roof, The Daily Wildcat reports.

Anderson was reportedly a freshman pre-business major and had rushed Phi Delta Gamma fraternity

The two then reportedly climbed the metal frame of a 20-foot cooling unit on top of the building. Anderson fell from the cooling unit onto the roof.

The unidentified student told police that Anderson fell to the roof.

Sgt. Filbert Barrera, a campus police spokesman, says Anderson already was dead when officers and Tucson fire personnel arrived.

He also said the climb seem planned.

'Somebody definitely gave a lot of thought to how they were going to get up there,' Barrera told The Arizona Daily Star.

The residence hall is located near the university's football stadium.

Barrera says an autopsy will determine if drugs or alcohol were factors in the fall.

The University's Residence Life office sent out a letter to students, telling them counseling is available if they need it, the Daily Star adds.

Anderson was a pre-business major and in the fall rushed Phil Delta Gamma fraternity, where his brother was already a member, KGUN9-TV reports.

Anderson's death occurred less than a week after an Arizona State University student fell to her death from a 10-story balcony at an off-campus apartment building, AZ Family reports.

Police said Naomi McClendon, 18, seemed intoxicated when she arrived at the building.
