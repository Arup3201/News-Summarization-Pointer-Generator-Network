Orphaned teenager Davion Only gave a tour of his foster home bedroom on Thursday as he continues his search to find the family he has always yearned for.

The 15-year-old revealed the cramped, shared room in St Petersburg where he keeps his only possessions under lock and key. He was so worried about his belongings being stolen that he hid the padlock under his hand as he opened the locker in front of TV cameras.

Davion's story has garnered nationwide attention and become a viral topic online after he stood up in a Florida church last month and asked if someone would please adopt him. Around 1,000 people have now contacted Davion's foster home to ask about him.

He told ABC on Thursday: 'People just don't know sometimes how hard it is and how much we try to do good.'

Davion shares a small room with bunk beds at the foster home, where he longs to have his own pillow for the first time in his life.

The
 15-year-old, who will age out of the foster care system in under three 
years, dreams of a family that can be his for life.

He added: 'I just want people to love me for who I am and to grab me and keep me in their house and love me no matter what.'

The boy's moving plea has sparked an 
incredible reaction online with close to 400,000 people reading his 
story on MailOnline. It has also been shared by 1,700 people on MailOnline's Facebook page and received nearly 6,000 likes.  

His
 foster home, the Carlton Manor residential center, is being inundated 
with more than 1,000 calls from potential adoptive parents across 
America.  

The company which runs the foster care facility posted on their Facebook page on Friday: 'We have received a tremendous response from Davion’s story!

'#Eckerd and our community partners have mobilized to create a call center to respond to each and every call coming in about #Davion.

'We ask that folks be patient, we are incredibly grateful for the outcry of interest in Davion and we will get back to everyone as soon as we can. We are nearing 1,000 inquiries already! #secondchances'

The heartbreaking insight into a 
child's life in foster care emerged after Davion, who recently 
discovered his mother had died, spoke to worshippers at St Mark's Missionary Baptist Church in September.

Davion started to look for his mother, whom he had never met, using his birth certificate at a local library in June. He found her obituary and discovered that La-Dwina Ilene 'Big Dust' McCloud (left) had died aged 55 in Clearwater just weeks before

He said: 'My name is Davion and I've been
 in foster care since I was born... I know God hasn't given up on me. 
So I'm not giving up either.

'I'll take anyone. Old or
 young, dad or mom, black, white, purple. I don't care. And I would be 
really appreciative. The best I could be.'

Terri
 Durdaller, spokesman for Florida Department of Children and Families 
Suncoast region, told MailOnline on Thursday that Davion's foster home had 
received hundreds of calls about him.

She added: 'We're hopeful that we can connect Davion with his forever family.'

Photographer Tim Boyles, took Davion's picture for adoption charity the Heart Gallery in 2005 and again earlier this year.

He told MailOnline: 'It broke my heart to photograph Davion a second
time. It had been eight years since I first photographed him for the
Heart Gallery. 

'He had grown up into such a fine, young man from the cute,
little boy he was in 2005, but one thing hadn't changed.  Davion was still
living in group homes and foster care.'

Davion's portrait is one of many in the Heart Gallery - an organization which helps children in foster care find moms and dads.

Each child has a short profile on the site telling prospective parents something about who they are.

Each article begins with an ID number from the foster care system and the words 'I am available'.

Davion,
 who is pictured smiling on the beach and throwing a basketball in the 
air, writes that his favorite school subject is science and that when he
 grows up he wants to be a police officer.

Davion had a second picture taken for his adoption profile when he was 15 where he describes his love of basketball and cartoons along with his desire for a family who are 'nice and fun'

He
 likes to eat 'Chinese Food or Buffets' and enjoys football and 
basketball along with video games, hand held games, cards and watching 
Cartoon Network.

When it comes to his friends, Davion looks for those 
who are true to themselves and to him.

On
 his ideal family, the teenager says he doesn't care if the people are 
rich or poor or what ethnic background they are from. He would like a 
family 'who are nice, fun and that know how to cook!'

The 15-year-old also gives a short description of what he is like for any family out there. 

Davion writes that he is: 'Nice and fun and would be happy to be adopted! Davion says the nicest thing he has ever done is a save a boy from drowning.'

Sadly, Davion's story of lifetime in 
foster care is far from unique in the U.S. There are currently 399,548 children in the system across America, many being cared for by 
devoted, temporary parents, and yet lacking in a definite place they can 
call home.

There are many older teenagers like Davion but fewer than 10 per cent of children adopted from foster care are between 14 and 17.

Davion himself knows how hard it is to find a family - indeed it was his idea to approach the St 
Petersburg church to find his own adoptive parents and take control of 
his future.

In three years time when he turns 18, he is aware that he 
will be on his own. Davion will turn 16 on February 12, 2014.

The average number of children who age out of the U.S. foster care system each year is 20,000.

Last month, Davion spoke quietly in front of the full pews at the Florida church wearing an over-sized, donated suit that had come from his latest foster home.

Davion's profile has been on the Heart Gallery for eight years, since his first photograph was taken at seven years old

The boy was born while his mother was in jail and has spent his entire childhood in countless foster homes. 

He told his caseworker Connie Going that he knows his adoptive parents are out there somewhere.

In June, Davion had come to terms with the death of his mother after he used his birth certificate to search for her for the first time on a computer at his local library.

He found her mugshot from her arrests for petty theft and cocaine. And then he found her obituary. 

La-Dwina Ilene 'Big Dust' McCloud had died aged 55 in Clearwater, Florida just weeks before.

He cried in the library when he read that his mother had died and remembered thinking to himself: 'This is ridiculous. How did I not know?'

Davion does not know any other members of his family.

The 15-year-old has spent the past few years at Carlton Manor residential group home in Eckerd, living with 12 other teenage boys, all suffering their own problem.

Looking for a family: 15-year-old Davion spoke to the church congregation about how badly he wanted a family to care about him

Davion longs to play football but has no one to take him to practice; to be able to use the bathroom without someone unlocking a door. He would like the light left on when he sleeps and a bed that he can call his own. 

The 15-year-old has had 
behavioral problems - struggling with his own anger at the circumstances
 in which he finds himself.

Dealing
 with his mother's death has led Davion to believe that he doesn't want 
to be angry anymore - he wants to discover a better life. 

Davion told ABC: 'I'm not going to use all my bad stuff that happened to me as an excuse, but I'm going to use it as motivation to push me more and give me more courage.'

He
 has spent the summer studying hard in 10th grade - achieving As in all 
but one subject - geometry. He has lost 40lb and tries to let go of his 
anger.

Davion also has
 support from his mentor Richard Prince, 22.

The two were paired up 
through the One Church One Child program and usually go to a park to 
play basketball or talk.

Floyd Watkins, program manager at Davion's group home, told Naplesnews: 'He's come a long way. He's starting to
 put himself out there, which is hard when you've been rejected so many 
times.'
