The grieving 45-year-old father of murdered schoolgirl Sarah Payne died alone in his armchair after being driven to drink and despair by the death of his daughter.

Michael Payne struggled with alcoholism after the abduction of his eight-year-old daughter in July 2000, and was found dead at home in Maidstone, Kent, by police on Monday.

His brother Alan, 47, believes 'he was in a downward spiral since it all happened with Sarah' and their father Terrance, 72, says his son was tortured by 'the fact he wasn't there to protect her'.

Kent Police  broke down the door of his flat because his family had been unable to contact him and MailOnline understands his body had been there for several days.

Broken man: Michael Payne, who died at 45, was tortured by the murder of his daughter Sarah and his life spiralled into chaos and alcoholism, his family said today

Michael's schoolgirl daughter was snatched by paedophile Roy Whiting from a field near her grandparents' home in West Sussex, where she was playing with older brothers Luke and Lee and younger sister Charlotte.

Mr Payne spoke of his battle with depression in the aftermath of the ordeal, when he suffered recurring nightmares and used alcohol to cope with her death.

He and wife Sara ended their 18-year marriage three years after the disappearance and both blamed the 'overwhelming' strains of coping with their tragic loss. 

After the divorce Mike, as he was known to his family and friends, moved from West Sussex to Maidstone to be near his family, especially his mother Cynthia and brother Alan.

Alan, 47, said: 'We are all in a state of shock. Michael has been in a downward spiral since it all happened with Sarah.

'When he split up with Sara and moved back here he was already a drinker.

'But I suppose then it got a lot worse. We still haven't identified the body and my mum is too devastated to see him. 

'I hadn't seen Michael for a few months so I didn't know he was sick. My mum is in pieces because it is one tragedy after the other. First Michael loses his daughter and now my mum loses a son.

'No one should be alive to see their child die. It is a nightmare.'

Michael's father Terrance said: 'He turned to drink because of what happened, for the fact he wasn't there to protect her.

'After the incident we all went downhill a bit, but we managed to pull ourselves together whereas Michael really struggled. We all knew Mike had demons but it's sad it has come to this.

He added: 'I hadn't spoken to him since the last Friday of September. I had agreed to speak to him the next week but there was no answer.

'I kept calling and leaving answerphone messages but never heard anything.

'Eventually the phone was cut off, so we knew something was wrong and we called the police.

'The police broke their way into his flat, and found him sitting there in his chair. We don't know exactly what he died of, but we think it was drink-related'. 

Terrance, who lives with second wife Lesley in Gunnislake, Cornwall, added the family felt bitter that Michael had died while jailed Whiting, 55, would one day walk free.

He said: 'It's terrible that Whiting will one day see the outside of a prison, when he has left so much destruction in his wake.

'Paedophiles never get cured, Whiting had done this once before and was left to walk free'.  

Michael Payne and his then wife  made a series of heart-rending appeals for her safe return, but her body was discovered 16 days later in a shallow grave just a few miles away.

Neighbour Ivy Holohan, 82,  said: 'When the police knocked on my door they said there was a bit of a problem I said what's that and they said it was about Michael.

'I wondered what was happening but they boarded the doors up now. It was a shock, a shame really.'

Another neighbour who asked not to be named said: 'You didn't see him out anywhere.

'He used to drive a mini-bus for an OAP community scheme, I think. People knew who he was and his terrible past. We all felt so sorry for him bit he didn't mix with any of us in the block to be honest.

'It's an absolute tragedy. He clearly never got over what happened – who would?

Roy Whiting was convicted of murdering schoolgirl Sarah Payne in 2000.

'It's awful for it to end that way. It's the rest of his children you feel sorry for now.'

Whiting, who had served a previous prison sentence for assaulting a young girl, was given a life sentence for her murder in 2001.

Messages of support poured in for the family, who have spoken publicly about the devastating consequences of Sarah's murder at the hands of paedophile Roy Whiting.

A senior police officer who worked on the initial investigation into Sarah's disappearance said Mr Payne was 'a good man who battled with demons'.

Martyn Underhill, now the Police and Crime Commissioner for Dorset, said: 'I was honoured to have known him.

'But all he ever wanted to do was to see his daughter again. When Sarah went, it destroyed Michael as well.'

Referring to the turmoil her family suffered, Sarah's sister Charlotte, now 19, said on Facebook: 'I'm sorry I couldn't save you dad. I hope you have finally found your peace and happiness.

'Heartbroken to say the least. No matter what happened and how many mistakes we all made. You will always be my daddy.' Her older brother Lee, 27, a personal trainer, wrote: 'Dad, you had your demons and troubles but you had a good heart ... I hope now you have found peace at last. You will be missed. We are all heartbroken.' 

Speaking in 2003, Mrs Payne said: 'We know we're not the same people we once were – and everyone knows the awful reason why.'

Mr Payne said: 'I've a lot of anger and bitterness inside me. I'm full of guilt and rage that I wasn't there to protect my little girl.'

The former airport worker later admitted the couple had violent rows after he turned to drink as a way of coping.

He was given a community order by magistrates after he admitted punching his estranged wife during an alcohol-fuelled row in 2005.

And he was jailed for 16 months in 2011 after pleading guilty to glassing his brother Stephen following a session of heavy drinking when they both consumed several litres of cider. 

The court heard he was tormented by losing his daughter.

Sarah's mother, 45, went on to campaign for a change in legislation to allow parents to know if convicted child sex offenders live nearby, known as Sarah's Law.

She has been awarded an MBE and an honorary doctorate for her work and told recently how it had given her 'much-needed focus' amid the grief and her severe post-traumatic stress disorder.

Mrs Payne also suffered a stroke in 2009 which has left her walking with the assistance of a stick.

Yesterday her fellow campaigner Shy Keenan said Mrs Payne was grateful for the public's support, adding: 'Sara thanks you all (more than she can say right now) for your love, kindness and understanding at this very painful time in their lives.

'Sara wants to be left alone to care for her grief-stricken family.'

Kent Police are not treating Mr Payne's death at his flat in Maidstone as suspicious. An inquest is expected to be opened next week.

In December 2001, Roy Whiting was sentenced to life in prison with a recommendation that he never be released after a jury found him guilty of the abduction and murder of Sarah Payne.

After his conviction was entered, the court heard he had a previous conviction for the kidnap and indecent assault of a nine-year-old girl.

The jury, who had been unaware of the previous sex conviction, were told Whiting had been sentenced to four years in jail for the sex attack in June 1995.

Revelations Whiting already had a history of child abuse prior to the killing of Sarah prompted a national debate about how paedophiles are dealt with in the justice system.

Mr and Mrs Payne began actively campaigning for a law change, piling pressure on ministers to allow people to know about convicted paedophiles living in their area.

In the wake of Whiting's sentencing, Mrs Payne said: 'The Government only can make this decision. Right now, we have got a lot of work to do and it doesn't stop here. It just begins. You know what change I want, Sarah's Law.'

The rule, eventually introduced in 2011, allows concerned parents or grandparents to contact police to find out if a new boyfriend, or a neighbour, who has contact with a child, has a history of child sex offending.

The scheme is a watered-down version of similar laws in the U.S. under which details of where convicted paedophiles live are actively publicised.

In 2008, Mrs Payne was awarded an MBE for her tireless campaigning on the issue.
