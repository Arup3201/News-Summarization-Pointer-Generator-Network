Hazel Jones always wondered why she suffered from terrible cramps and heavy periods during puberty. But it wasn't until she turned 18 that she was given her astonishing diagnosis - she had two vaginas.

The blonde 27-year-old from High Wycombe has the million-in-one condition uterus didelphys, which means she has two separate uteruses and cervixes as well.

Hazel Jones: Lost her virginity twice due to her rare condition

But she told ITV's This Morning she was comfortable with having the condition, despite the fact she had to effectively lose her virginity twice.

'Once I found out what it was I told everybody,' she told TV hosts Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield.

'I thought it was amazing and it's definitely an ice-breaker at parties'

She added: 'If women want to have a look, I'm quite happy to show them, it's not something I'm embarrassed by.'

Hazel went to the doctor after her long-term boyfriend told her she was 'different' in the genital area.

Sitting next to Hazel, Doctor Dawn 
Harper explained: 'When developing in the womb girls start with two 
tubes. These fuse and the septum breaks down and forms one uterus.

'In around one in 3,000 cases the septum stays within the uterus but to actually have two separate uteruses is much rarer.'

Hazel said previously she had found sex very uncomfortable, but now she didn't suffer any adverse effects. She turned down surgery as it could have left significant scar tissue.

She revealed: 'When I was younger I thought I was having cystitis and urine infections from a young age when I was tearing the middle septum.'

She added that she once asked a school friend which 'hole' she should use for a tampon, but became too embarrassed to continue the conversation after her friend thought she meant she put it up her bottom.

She added: 'I used to suffer from horrendous cramps and my periods could be very heavy. I now know that my periods were worse because I have two wombs.

'So if I get pregnant I have to be very aware not to get pregnant on the other side.'

Dr Harper added that Hazel was more likely to have a breached birth as her uteruses were smaller and she was more likely to need a caesarean section. She must also have double smear tests when checking for cervical cancer.

But Hazel is unphased by the prospect.

'I have a great sex life,' she said.
