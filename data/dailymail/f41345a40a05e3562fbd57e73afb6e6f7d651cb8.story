Local boy Andy Goode inspired Wasps to the perfect start at their new Ricoh Arena home with a record Premiership points haul that helped sink their former London rivals.

The 34-year Wasps fly half, who was born in Coventry and attended the city’s King Henry VIII school, produced a superb display to collect eight penalties, two conversions and a second-half try that brought him 33 points — one better than the previous best shared by Niall Woods (London Irish, 1998), Dave Walder (Newcastle, 2000) and Tim Stimpson (Leicester, 2002).

With a record home crowd of 28,254 in attendance and gate receipts in excess of £500,000, things really could not have gone any better on or off the field for the new team in town.

‘It sounds a bit cheesy but that’s what dreams are made of,’ said Goode, a lifelong Coventry City fan. ‘It couldn’t have gone any better. I didn’t sleep that well last night.

‘I’ve been up here a fair few times to watch Coventry City play but to run out on the field was unbelievable.

‘I got a hammering from my little girl for missing five kicks last week (against Castres). She made me change my boots and everything. 

'As I came off the field she was there and she said, “You’re keeping those boots forever, Daddy”.’

There were clear first-half nerves, not least from rookie referee Tom Foley, whose whistle threatened to ruin any hope of a fluid game. 

Goode took advantage with unerring accuracy, kicking six penalties in the first 40 minutes after Exiles prop Geoff Cross had briefly threatened to spoil Wasps’ party with an opportunist try for the visitors on 16 minutes

Wasps pulled away in spectacular fashion in the second half with Joe Simpson’s try opening the floodgates before London Irish hooker David Paice was sinbinned. Wasps took full advantage with three tries to seal an all-important bonus point.

Goode, Elliot Daly and Andrea Masi all crossed as Wasps moved above Quins and Leicester into sixth in the Aviva Premiership table. 

Just as importantly, the club which so nearly went bankrupt last season finally appears to have found a home.

High Wycombe’s Adams Park felt a long way away in every sense by the time Foley blew his final whistle. 

The only concern was the worrying manner in which the pitch cut up during the course of the afternoon. No doubt fans of Coventry City will be keeping a close eye on that situation.

‘It was a big occasion for everybody but I’d have taken that before the game,’ said Wasps director of rugby Dai Young.

‘There was some emotion about beforehand. But the bonus point was the icing on the cake.’
