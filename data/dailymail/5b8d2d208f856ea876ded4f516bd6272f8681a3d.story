Leighanna Needham was not yet born when her brother Ben vanished.

The desperate search for the toddler dominated family life, as years passed and he was never found. To some victims of such appalling circumstance, having another baby would defy contemplation.

But Ben's sister, now 20, has revealed she is pregnant - despite being petrified of the same thing happening to her baby.

And she has said she refuses to be a helicopter parent after watching the terrible effect Ben's disappearance had on her mother Kerry.

The trainee accountant, who has been with her window fitter boyfriend Craig 
Fisher, 24, for five years, realised she was expecting a daughter when she fell ill on holiday in Turkey.

The news came despite doctors once telling her she might never conceive.

She told the Daily Mirror: 'Of course I am terrified my baby will be stolen like Ben. Every parent would be.

'My family have been through hell but I am not going to let that affect the way I love my child. I will not clip her wings.'

Ben was 21 months old when he vanished while playing with his toys in the garden of his grandparents' retirement farmhouse on the Greek island of Kos.

The case gained international media attention which would be dwarfed only by that given to the disappearance of Madeleine McCann 16 years later.

It resurged this year amid claims Ben may have been abducted by members of a Roma gypsy camp in Greece. A 22-year-old man had his DNA tested against Ben's, but the test came back negative.

Unlike in the McCann case, the Needham family were unable to gather millions in donations. For years they were going it alone, with no hope of finding Ben on the horizon.

Leighanna's and Ben's mother Kerry could not cope with the pain, falling into a spiral of drink and nightclubs which ended in Leighanna being sent to live with her grandparents for two months.

Leighanna, from Sheffield, told the Mail on Sunday last year: ‘I’ve been wrapped up in cotton wool all my life. I wasn’t allowed to do anything as a child.

‘I couldn’t even stay over at a friend’s house until I was 13. I was always told it was “just in case”.'

She added: 'She has since told me that after Ben went missing, she used to hear him crying. She had a bedroom full of his toys for when he came home.

'She used to get up in the night and go to rock him to sleep and he wasn’t there. Before I was born, she was going insane with grief.

‘She had counselling and was advised to have another baby.  At first she said she couldn’t do it. It hurt her to have me. Now I understand.'

Although she blames her mother for nothing, Leighanna is determined to allow her own daughter more freedom.

And she told the Daily Mirror: 'I want Ben home more than ever now. I want him to know he's going to be an uncle.'
