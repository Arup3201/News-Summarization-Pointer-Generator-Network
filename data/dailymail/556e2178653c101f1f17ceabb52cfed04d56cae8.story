Tom Daley is ‘hungry for gold’ and a slice of revenge on Saturday after relinquishing his 10m synchronised title to Matthew Mitcham but he will have to overcome his own ‘demon dive’ as well as his great Australian rival if he is to top the podium in the 10m individual event.

Daley and James Denny were delighted to take silver last night on Friday night - missing gold by the equivalent of a misplaced baby toe - having only formed a partnership last week and completed just three training sessions together. But if he is to upgrade to gold Daley needs to conquer the dreaded ‘twister’ dive, which has been his nemesis since London 2012.

He traced his problems back to the Olympic final, when his focus was disrupted by a flash from a camera in the crowd. Daley messed up and was allowed to repeat the dive, going on to win a bronze. But it has had him spooked ever since, with one prominent sport psychologist suggesting he might be suffering from ‘Lost Move’ syndrome - diving’s equivalent of the yips.

The dive, which carries a difficulty rating of 3.8 and involves two-and-a-half somersaults with two-and-a-half twists in the piked position, is not the trickiest in Daley’s repertoire - but it is the one that has struck fear into him.

After faltering again when performing the dive at a World Series event in London in April, causing him to miss out on a medal, Daley admitted it was a ‘massive problem’. He said: ‘When you look down, your knees go weak, your legs go to jelly and it’s terrifying.

‘The twister is my nemesis dive and it always will be, I think. It’s one of those things that I really struggle with. The more scared you are in that dive, the more detrimental it is. I have to go out there and feel as confident as I can. It’s the dive that’s the weakest on my list at the moment.’

Daley has reason to be fearful. If you said you weren’t scared by somersaulting backwards while twisting your body around with your head spinning just inches from the board, ‘you’re either lying or stupid,’ he quipped. Daley has enlisted a sport psychologist and had what he termed ‘trauma therapy’ in an attempt to conquer his fears.

Dr Mike Rotherham, a sport psychologist, suggested ‘Lost Move’ syndrome. ‘It tends to affect more of the artistic type of sports such as diving, gymnastics and trampolining where, for some unknown reason, it’s not uncommon for athletes to be unable to complete their routine which they could normally do with ease,’ he told the Telegraph. ‘It tends to manifest itself in freezing. It’s similar to the yips.’

Daley was first encouraged to add the dive to his repertoire by former mentor Leon Taylor, who said he did not regret encouraging him to attempt the ‘twister’.

‘It’s mind games and not about your physical ability to do the specific dive,’ said Taylor, ‘All divers go through it. What you have is an increased level of anxiety, and the more nervous you get the worse the problem becomes.’

Daley, 20, was still the No 1 attraction at Edinburgh’s Royal Commonwealth Pool despite the success of the rest of England’s diving team, namely Jack Laugher who won two golds and won silver this week. There were ‘I love Tom’ T-shirts and posters and several young girls screaming for ‘selfies’ with their sporting hero.

The most enthusiastic support came from the front row, behind a St George’s Cross flag with ‘Tom Daley’ emblazoned on it in gold lettering. Daley’s mother Debbie, brother Ben and boyfriend Dustin Lance Black exploded into cheers as he and Denny aced their treacherous sixth dive.

They were last of the four pairs going into the final round, after ragged dives in the third and fourth rounds. The tannoy system reiterated that - according to Commonwealth Games federation rules - only a gold and silver medal would be awarded. ‘We knew it before but it made it a bit more dramatic hearing it halfway through,’ said Daley.

Against the grain, they nailed the forward four-and-a-half somersault, the hardest dive any pair attempted and dramatically increase their score to 399.54, just 0.18 behind Mitcham (left) and his partner Dominic Bedggood. ‘He’s won six silvers but that’s the first Commonwealth gold Matt has won,’ said Daley. ‘He’ll be hungry for another but I’m hungry, too.’
