A shopper was dismayed to discover his local Tesco selling 22 different varieties of apples but not one of them was British.

Leo Deen checked 22 different varieties of the fruit at Tesco on Hibel Road in Macclesfield for a native apple - before walking away empty handed.

Instead he found fruit which had been transported thousands of miles from Chile, the U.S., New Zealand and South Africa.

Mr Deen, the town’s mayor Janet Jackson and Food4Macc, a campaigning group, are now calling for stores to stock more locally-sourced produce.

Mr Deen, 50, from Siddington, said: 'When I couldn’t find an English apple I had to check twice. A member of staff checked as well and admitted they had none in stock. He was clearly embarrassed.

'Supermarkets should be buying local or at least from the same country and supporting British farmers, not flying in apples from the other side of the world during peak apple season in this country.'

Colin Townend, from Food4Macc, a voluntary group which campaigns for locally-produced food, called for Tesco to introduce a ‘local produce section’ in its stores.

He said: 'We understand the economic drivers behind the supermarkets' buying policies, but in the same way as organic food was a specialty product a few years ago but now enjoys its own sections in supermarkets, we would like to see the supermarkets having "local produce" sections, exploiting the loyalty to local producers that undoubtedly exists.'

A quick survey of other retailers in the town found Aldi and Sainsbury’s supermarkets both selling at least one brand of English apple, while Alan Reddy’s fruit and veg stall at the indoor market sold only English varieties.

Mayor of Macclesfield, councillor Janet Jackson, carried out her own survey and found the same.

She said: 'The cost of air miles for fruit brought from around the world is impacting on our economy and our climate.

'I would hope that supermarkets would, when such produce is in season in Britain, make sure that homegrown fruit is given priority. Focus on British fruit to cut down on the air miles.'

A spokesman for Tesco said the Macclesfield store may have suffered an ‘off day’.

He said: 'Our stocklists show Pink Lady and Bramley English varieties on sale, as well as many other British products in our fruit and vegetable section, including our tomatoes which are from Cheshire.

'At the time the customer visited we may have not had any in stock. It is possible we had an off day.

'Tesco sold more English apples and pears in 2013-14 than any other retailer. The traditional British apple season runs from September to July and our first new season British apple was in store this weekend.'

Apple production tends to be associated with Kent and Herefordshire.

However, Cheshire has a rich history of growing apples and boasts 33 varieties, including the Minshull Crab.

Mr Deen found 22 different varieties of apples at the Tesco from these eight locations around the world

As the apple market becomes increasingly dominated by varieties originally produced overseas, there are concerns homegrown British creations are becoming harder to find. However, there are a number of British varieties which remain respected and enjoyed for their individual traits and unique flavours.

Laxton's Fortune - created by the same company as Laxton's Superb - originated in Bedford in 1904. The bright red apple has a firm but coarse texture and is available in October and November.

The Worcester Pearmain takes its name from its birthplace where it was introduced in 1874. Available in August and September, it has a unique strawberry-like flavour and tastes sweet.

In terms of cooking, the British Bramley apple is regarded at the world's finest. The variety, first produced in Nottinghamshire about 200 years ago, is available throughout the year and has an ability to retain its taste during cooking.

Cox's Orange Pippin is a highly regarded eating apple and was first produced in Buckinghamshire by horticulturalist Richard Cox. It is said to be aromatic and juicy.
