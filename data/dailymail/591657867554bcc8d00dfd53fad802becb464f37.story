A TV commercial showing a seven-year-old blind girl's imaginary Land of Oz has taken the Internet by storm after being aired during the Oscars, with many users deeming it 'beautiful' and 'moving'.

The advert, created by Comcast to promote its new 'talking guide', details how Emily, a creative little girl from Iowa, sees the scenes and characters from the 1939 film, The Wizard Of Oz , in her mind.

Narrating over a clip depicting an emerald-colored city and tornado, Emily, who is completely blind, says: 'I think about the shape, I think about color, and I also think about sound. I take it into my brain.'

She adds: 'I think about... what would [the film] look like to me?', before explaining how her Tin Man has 'a big toe the size of a house' and her Cowardly Lion is 'small like a toy poodle' with webbed feet.

Positive response: Within minutes of the commercial being aired during a break of the 87th Annual Academy Awards in Los Angeles on Sunday, hundreds of people had taken to Twitter to express their delight over it

The commercial then shows the lion - who walks on his hands - approaching a puddle filled with red lava in a forest setting, before jumping back in fright. Emily says: 'He is very scared of everything.'

She then goes on to explain how her Scarecrow has large wooden teeth, 'very long' fingernails and wears tubes for clothes. And as for the main character, Dorothy, Emily adds: 'She looks just like me.'

The little girl is then filmed walking along a yellow, patterned road with her three creations as a male narrator says: 'Everyone has a favorite movie. Now, people with visual disabilities can find theirs.'
