A senior Liberal Democrat MP has used a Commons motion to launch an astonishing attack on the head of the Hacked Off pressure group for 'acting against freedom of expression and the rule of law' during his legal career.

John Hemming has condemned Hugh Tomlinson QC, the barrister who has led Hacked Off's call for state-backed regulation of the press, for his role in bringing legal injunctions on behalf of footballer Ryan Giggs and banker Fred Goodwin.

The MP also claims that Mr Tomlinson helped to secure the 'secret imprisonment' of a woman simply for 'writing emails'.

In his early day motion, Mr Hemming criticises Mr Tomlinson – a barrister based at Cherie Blair's Matrix Chambers – for taking out the super-injunction which banned any mention of an affair between Giggs and model Imogen Thomas.

The MP also criticises Mr Tomlinson for obtaining an injunction on behalf of disgraced banker Goodwin, which stopped newspapers from reporting details of an affair he had with a member of his staff.

Mr Hemming also accuses Mr Tomlinson of playing a key role in Yvonne Goder being jailed after sending emails to the Law Society complaining that a solicitors' firm had defrauded her mother using the Court of Protection.

Mr Tomlinson's spokesman said: 'The motion contains a number of significant factual errors.

'Mr Tomlinson must take cases within his areas of expertise: he is not permitted to choose which cases to take based on his personal view. The arguments he advances are based on the instructions of his clients.

'Mr Hemming is entitled to criticise Mr Tomlinson's personal views, or the views of Hacked Off, but he is not entitled to attribute to Mr Tomlinson the views and arguments of his clients.'
