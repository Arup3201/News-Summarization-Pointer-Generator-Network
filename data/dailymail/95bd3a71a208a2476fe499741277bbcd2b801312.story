President Obama swept back into the White House after forging a diverse coalition of support from women, minorities, the young and a new powerhouse in American politics – the Hispanics.

While Mitt Romney’s votes came overwhelmingly from older white voters, whose share of the electorate is diminishing, Barack Obama’s triumph was fuelled by the Hispanic vote, which is growing in numbers and influence with every election.

As America’s fastest-growing demographic, it made up 10 per cent of all votes cast on Tuesday – and they backed the president in huge numbers.

Voters queued in long lines to mark their ballot papers - but it was a diverse coalition of support from women, minorities, the young and Hispanics that won it for Obama

Angered by the Republican candidate’s hardline stance on immigration, Hispanics supported Mr Obama by an overwhelming 70 per cent to 30 per cent margin.

In Florida, the biggest battleground prize with 29 electoral votes, Mr Romney’s failure to secure the state was blamed squarely on losing the Hispanic vote.

There was no surprise that black voters backed the president by a massive majority, and his election triumph was boosted by women and younger Americans, just as it was the first time around.

Divided nation

This year is likely to be the first in recent history when the majority of babies born in the US are to families from an ethnic minority background.

That demographic shift is already being felt at polling stations – 72 per cent of those who cast their vote this year were white, down from 74 per cent in 2008.

Matt Barreto, a political scientist at the University of Washington, said it was critical for the president to retain the Hispanic voting bloc, especially because he lost support among white men – which had declined to 36 per cent from 41 per cent four years ago.

The president made a strong effort to court the estimated 24 million eligible Hispanic voters, seeking to overcome some discontent over his immigration policies.

In September, he had admitted that his ‘biggest failure’ was the lack of comprehensive immigration reform, although his administration launched a programme in June to allow young undocumented immigrants to apply for temporary work permits.

‘We saw Obama’s standing among Hispanics and overall voter enthusiasm increase after his announcement this summer,’ said Mr Barreto.

In sharp contrast, Mr Romney took a hard line, saying illegal immigrants should leave the country – or ‘self-deport’ –before making a bid for US citizenship.

In a bid to reverse the decline in Republican support, Florida’s Hispanic Senator Marco Rubio was already being tipped yesterday as a possible presidential candidate for the party at the next election in 2016.

Al Cardenas, head of the American Conservative Union and a Republican leader, said: ‘Our party needs to realise that it’s too old, too white and too male, and it needs to figure out how to catch up with the demographics of the country before it’s too late.’

William Frey, a senior demographer at the Washington-based Brookings Institution, added: ‘Even modest white support is no longer necessary for a Democratic victory, if there is strong turnout from minorities.’
