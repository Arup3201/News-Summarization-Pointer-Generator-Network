Britain’s spies might have a licence to kill, but they risk losing their licence to drive if they are caught speeding – until now.

Rules which mean the secret services, bomb disposal units and organ transplant deliveries have to stick to the speed limit are to be torn up.

Changes to motoring laws mean officers in MI5 and MI6 will be able to break speed limits when national security is at stake.

Law breaker: Spies like James Bond will be able to break the speed limit without falling foul of the police

The idea of giving more people the same rights on the road as ‘blue light’ services like the police, ambulance and fire brigade was backed by 9 out of 10 of those who responded to a government consultation.

Under the move exemptions from having to stick to the speed limit will be expanded.

But before spooks can put their foot down they will have to undergo a driver training course.

It means scenes of James Bond speeding through the streets of London and the UK meant 007 was actually breaking the law.

Transport minister Robert Goodwill is expected to give them the green light to speeding when the responses to the consultation have been considered.

Vehicles used to carry organs for transplant, bomb disposal units, and mountain rescue teams are also set to be added to the list.

Bomb disposal units will also be able to ignore speed limits when rushing to security incidents

It is understood that 93 per cent of those who replied to the consultation on the issue backed extending the speeding exemption to those involved in ‘the protection of life and limb or national security’.

The DfT said: ‘The strongest support came from the Police Service who gave their full backing to  this proposal.

‘Most of those that commented agreed that emergency response drivers must be appropriately trained for what can be extremely demanding circumstances.

‘It therefore made sense to regulate and prescribe high speed training to those who can demonstrate a need to be exempt from speed limits.’
