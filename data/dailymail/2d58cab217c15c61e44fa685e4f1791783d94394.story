Former Chicago Bears coach and ESPN analyst Mike Ditka has blamed 'politically correct idiots' for the controversy over the Redskins' name.

There have been calls for the Washington team to change its name after complaints that 'Redskins' is an offensive or racist term for Native Americans.

But Ditka doesn't agree.

'What's all the stink over the Redskin name?' he demanded during an interview with the RedskinsHistorian.com. 'It's so much [expletive] it's incredible. We're going to let the liberals of the world run this world. It was said out of reverence, out of pride to the American Indian.'

Anger: Former Chicago Bears player and coach Mike Ditka has said in an interview that he cannot believe the controversy over the Redskins' name - insisting that the term was used out of pride for Native Americans

He continued: 'I hope that owner keeps fighting for it and never changes it, because the Redskins are part of an American football history, and it should never be anything but the Washington Redskins. That's the way it is.'

He added that the controversy was due to 'the political correct idiots in America'.

'It's fine to protest,' he said. 'That's your right, if you don't like it, protest. You have a right to do that, but to change the name, that's ridiculous. Change the Constitution -€” we've got people trying to do that, too, and they're doing a pretty good job.'

But not everyone agrees with him.

On Monday, two influential NFL voices - including CBS lead analyst Phil Simms, who will handle Washington's Week 4 game - said they would not be using the name during broadcasts.

'My very first thought is it will be "Washington" the whole game,' Simms told The Associated Press.

Simms will work the Thursday night package the network acquired this season and will cover the Giants-Redskins game on September 25.

He said that he isn't taking sides in the debate over whether Washington's nickname is offensive or racist, but he says he is sensitive to the complaints about the name.

Decisions: CBS lead analyst Phil Simms, left, said he will use 'Washington' instead of 'Redskins' during broadcasts to respect the complaints. His broadcast partner Jim Nantz, right, said he will not take a stance

'I never really thought about it, and then it came up and it made me think about it,' Simms added. 'There are a lot of things that can come up in a broadcast, and I am sensitive to this.'

His broadcast partner, Jim Nantz, says it is 'not my job to take a stance'.

NBC's Tony Dungy, one of the most prominent voices in the league as a Super Bowl-winning coach and now as a studio commentator, plans to take the same route as Simms.

'I will personally try not to use Redskins and refer to them as Washington,' Dungy said in an email. 'Personal opinion for me, not the network.'

Support: Team owner Daniel Snyder has met with American Indians who have supported the name

CBS is allowing its announcers to decide on their own whether to call the team the Redskins. So is Fox, which handles the NFC and will televise most of Washington's games.

'As long as their nickname is the Redskins, I'll continue to call them the Redskins,' said Hall of Famer Troy Aikman, the lead analyst for Fox.

NBC does not have any Redskins games scheduled - the late-season flex scheduling could change that - but the team certainly will be mentioned on its NFL telecasts this season.

The network said: 'For all of our sports properties, our on-air commentators have full discretion to reference participating teams by their city/region/state name, team nickname or both.'

ESPN said in a statement: 'We use the marks and nicknames as utilized by the teams, leagues and conferences we cover.'

But several CBS announcers, appearing at a network news conference about its NFL coverage, said they will use the nickname.

'That's
 the name of their team and that's what I am going to use,' said Boomer 
Esiason, a member of the CBS studio crew and also an analyst for 
Westwood One on Monday night games.

Solomon Wilcots said he will use 
'Washington Redskins as long as that is what they are called. That's 
their official name and I used it last year, two years ago, 10 years 
ago.'

Rich Gannon, the NFL's MVP in 2002 with the Raiders, spent one season playing for the Redskins. He now announces games for CBS.

'There
 are so many Redskins fans that take great pride in the name,' Gannon 
said. '(Owner) Daniel Snyder has said he's talked and visited with 
(many) American Indian nations who are supportive of the name. And there
 are those who oppose it who are being heard. It's an important topic.'

The Redskins' nickname was the subject of a halftime essay by NBC's Bob Costas last October when Washington played Dallas on Sunday night.

In part, Costas said, 'Think for a moment about the term "Redskins", and how it truly differs from all the others. Ask yourself what the equivalent would be, if directed toward African-Americans, Hispanics, Asians, or members of any other ethnic group.

'When considered that way, "Redskins" can't possibly honor a heritage, or noble character trait, nor can it possibly be considered a neutral term.  It's an insult, a slur, no matter how benign the present-day intent.'
