A massive dust storm enveloped Arizona on Friday, cutting power to thousands of homes and delaying numerous flights.

The monster cloud, about 3,000-feet-high and 30-miles-wide, moved through Phoenix about 5.30pm bringing violent thunderstorms and driving winds.

This was the second haboob to engulf Arizona this month, with meteorologists saying dust storms are common this time of year.Â

'According to NOAA's Storm Events Database, Maricopa County had 50 days with at least one dust storm reported between 2000 and 2013, an average of three to four dust storms per year,' weather.com meteorologist Nick Wiltgen said.

'That said, formal criteria for a dust storm warning require visibility of 1/4 mile or less, so it's possible that quite a few incidents of blowing dust aren't included in that figure.'

About 12,000 households were left without power during the dust storm, with most outages in the southeast Valley and Apache Junction area.

At 6pm, a temporary 'ground stop' for all incoming flights at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport was issued, delaying flights. The airport reopened at 8.10pm.

Strong storms then followed-up the dust,
 bringing heavy rains, strong winds and low visibility to the city, USA Today reported.

On July 3, a giant dust storm engulfed the Phoenix area, knocking down trees and power lines, and grounding flights heading into the Fourth of July weekend.
