‘Plebgate’ MP Andrew Mitchell has been blocked from telling a court how the scandal has damaged his life.

Mr Mitchell was forced out of his Cabinet job after a row with police at the Downing Street gates in September 2012, but insists officers lied  about what happened. He was accused of calling a policeman a ‘f****** pleb’ during the row, a charge he has vehemently denied. 

One PC, Keith Wallis, has admitted he wrongly claimed to have witnessed the argument and will be sentenced this week for misconduct in public office.

But it can be revealed today that Mr Mitchell’s own account of the incident will not be put before the judge.

In an extraordinary intervention, prosecutors have told the former Chief Whip that they will not submit his ‘impact statements’ because they do not agree he was the victim of a police conspiracy.

Mr Mitchell believes the officer he argued with as he tried to cycle through the Downing Street gates, PC Toby Rowland, also lied about what happened – but he has not been charged and is suing the Tory MP for libel over the allegation.

The Crown Prosecution Service wrote to Mr Mitchell on Friday, saying: ‘Your assertion does not accord with the rest of the prosecution evidence upon which we concluded that there was insufficient [evidence] to show that PC Rowland lied or that you were a victim of a conspiracy of misinformation.’

British police officer Keith Wallis arrives at the Old Bailey in London, England on 10 January 2014. 
The officer from the Diplomatic Protection Group is in court over claims that he sent an email to the deputy chief whip, John Randall, who was his MP, wrongly claiming that he had seen an incident in Downing Street involving other police officers and British Conservative Party member Andrew Mitchell

The letter added: ‘We are not proposing to draw the judge’s attention to any part of the statements you have already given.’ However, the letter said that if Mr Mitchell wanted to prepare another statement that referred only to the impact of PC Wallis’s conduct on him, the CPS would ‘consider your representations’.

Last November the CPS said there was insufficient evidence to show PC Rowland had lied, but soon after the Tory MP for Sutton Coldfield said the ‘lying phrases’ had been ‘made up and disseminated’ to ‘destroy my political career’.

PC Wallis and five other officers face gross misconduct proceedings while three others face less serious disciplinary action. PC Rowland does not face any action.Mr Mitchell declined to comment.
