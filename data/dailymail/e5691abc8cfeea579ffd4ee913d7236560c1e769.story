In a revealing interview on BBC One, the politician admitted his family had paid the price for his position as the head of the United Kingdom Independence Party.

Once described as 'the most hated man in Britain', an emotional Farage appeared to break down in tears he said how his children were being judged 'unfairly'.

'We have this very unusual surname, there aren't many of us, and that is difficult, it is difficult,' said the MEP who has two children under the age of 15 and another two in their 20s, 

'It is difficult when you are younger because you are going to get teased mercilessly wherever you go, but it actually difficult when you are grown up too, because people are judging you unfairly by your father, and that's tough, that is tough.'

But he said his family's struggle would not make him give up the chance to establish Ukip as a party with real political sway.

'I've got to go with it and to hell with the consequences,' he added. 

It appears his ambition is paying off as Ukip are predicted to win six seats in the general election.

Farage himself had unsuccessfully contested British parliamentary elections for UKIP five times, both before and after his election as an MEP.

In August 2014 he was selected as the UKIP candidate for South Thanet in this year's general election. 

He was recently questioned on his 'most hated' title during an appeareance on Loose Women.

Actress Linda Robson, one of the show’s panellists, asked Mr Farage why he had been voted ‘the most hated man in Britain’. 

He said: 'You look at these political figures, they are all like cardboard cut-outs. They are all playing safe, they are all scared of the media. I’m not, I’m a bit like Marmite. People either like me or don’t like me.’

He added that all politicians are fundamentally ‘selfish’ and neglect their families.

He said: ‘The other three big leaders are very good at coming on programmes like this and saying what wonderful family men they are, how they do the school run and when the babies were little they changed all the nappies and did the night feeds. Maybe that’s true. All I can say is, it’s pretty much impossible to do that.’

Often pictured down the pub pint in hand, Farage also admitted he also had a secret nocturnal habit- shore fishing.

The party leader said he would often travel down to the coast from London and have three or four hours of fishing through to the early hours after a busy day.
