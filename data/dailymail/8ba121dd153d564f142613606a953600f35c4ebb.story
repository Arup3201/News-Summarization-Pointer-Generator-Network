Less than 12 hours after his boss captured the nation's attention with an energetic State of the Union address, Vice President Joe Biden grabbed the spotlight Wednesday morning to promote his chances to grab the top job in 2016.

Despite near-universal recognition that the Democratic presidential nomination is Hillary Clinton's to lose, Biden told ABC News host George Stephanopolous that the race is 'wide open.'

And he might challenge her, he said on 'Good Morning America.'

'Yes,' the vice president chuckled, 'there's a chance, but I haven't made my mind up about that.'

TANNED, RESTED AND READY: Joe Biden says he's got as good a shot as anyone to be the next president

REALLY? George Stephanopolous quizzed the VP on Wednesday and gave him an opening to stomp on President Barack Obama's news cycle following the annual State of the Union address

HILLARY WHO? Biden thinks the Democratic presidential nomination race is 'wide open' despite former secretary of state Clinton's commanding lead in every poll

'We've got a lot of work to do between now and then. There's plenty of time.'

'Look,' he said, 'the person who is going to – and, and Secretary Clinton is really competent, capable person, and a friend – the person who is going to be the next President of the United States is the one who's going to be able to articulate the clearest vision to the American people of where they're going to take the country.'

'I think this is wide open on both sides,' he insisted.

Biden ran for the presidency in 2008, announcing his candidacy by this point in the cycle eight years ago.

But this time around he said he's in no hurry to declare.

'I don't think you have to make up your mind until the summer,' Biden explained, before pivoting back to his main job – promoting Obama's economic agenda in the wake of the annual speech before a joint session of Congress.

'Look, right now my focus is getting implemented what the president talked about last night – nail down this recovery, and get the middle class back in the game.'

The vice president will resume his duties a White House cheerleader-in-chief Wednesday afternoon when he hosts a 5:00 p.m. conference call with supporters.

The call, billed as an 'off the record' discussion but likely to be a freewheeling altar call for Obama, is being promoted by Organizing For Action, the group that was called Obama For America until after the president's re-election.

Biden is 'going to discuss the plans President Obama laid out in the State of the Union last night,' the group said in an email to its list of millions, 'and give his take on what we can all do to help make progress this year.'

He won't likely discuss his own presidential ambitions, however. 

ALSO ON THE BACK-BENCH: Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a populist 'liberal's liberal' who insists she won't run, polls higher than Biden in some surveys

Biden is a bigger long-shot for the Democrats' nomination than most of the Republican field opposing them. 

In mid-December a Monmouth University poll put his national support in a primary fight at just 2 per cent.

He hasn't polled higher than 14 per cent among Democrats – that was in a single late-December ABC News poll – and usually hovers in the high single-digits.

The most recent major poll, from CNN and Opinion Research Corporation, puts him at 8 per cent, a single percentage point behind Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.

Clinton, however, wipes the floor with both of them: She attracted the support of 66 per cent of Demcorats in the poll.
