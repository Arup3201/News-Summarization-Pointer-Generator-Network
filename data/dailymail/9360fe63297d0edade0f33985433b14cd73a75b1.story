The girlfriend of former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi is appealing to Pope Francis for help after he was kicked out of parliament following a fraud conviction.

Ex-model Francesca Pascale, who at 28 is nearly 50 years younger than Berlusconi, spoke out just hours after senators voted to oust him from the Italian Senate, bringing an end to his infamous 20-year career.

Miss Pascale, who was pictured in the front row of a rally outside the billionaire tycoon's house in Rome, told Corriere Della Sera newspaper: 'I am going to ask Pope Francis for help. I want to meet him and make him listen to Berlusconi's story.'

She wants the leader of the Roman Catholic Church to intervene directly and help Berlusconi clear his name and return to front line politics, but it's unlikely the pontiff will step in and help.

In the interview, she also described her fiance's mood after senators voted to kick him out of parliament and how he has vowed to continue fighting political opponents - and how she would be standing by his side whatever happened.

She said: 'He's not depressed. He's angry. He has the anger of someone who has suffered an injustice.

'He just has a dream. He wants to make the country free. He will fulfil it.

'Silvio is what made me fall in love with him, he's not born to be alone and enjoy his wealth. It's against his nature, for him politics is a form of donation to others.

'Even when he was thinking of throwing
 it in, he was also building hospitals for children in Africa, 
universities for young people and his beloved Milan (football club).

'They
 think they will erase him. Instead they are just making him more 
determined to fight for freedom. I am with him, I will stay with him, 
whatever his decision.'

Two 
months ago, Miss Pascale gave an interview to a glossy Italian weekly in
 which she revealed she had first fallen in love with 77-year-old 
Berlusconi when she was a teenage activist in his Forza Italia party.

There
 were unconfirmed reports last month that the two had married and they 
have been pictured several times cosying up together at various 
restaurants, as well as in the stands at AC Milan's San Siro stadium.

Senators voted to expel Berlusconi after he was convicted earlier this year of tax fraud and sentenced initially to four years jail, which was later reduced to 12 months community service.

Although technically he can no longer serve as a politician, the three times PM has vowed he will continue to be a vocal force in politics from the sidelines, with his newly launched Forza Italia party.

Before the vote, he claimed he had new documents which would prove he was innocent of tax fraud and urged senators to delay the vote so they could look at them and clear him, but they ignored his appeals and it has since emerged the evidence is flawed.

Three-times married Berlusconi has always insisted that he is the 'most persecuted man since Jesus Christ' and that he is being deliberately targeted by left wing magistrates who are out to get him.

Besides his tax fraud conviction, he was also found guilty in the summer of having sex with an underage prostitute and abuse of office which resulted in a seven year prison sentence which has gone to an automatic appeal.
