Sydney is famous for its harbour and fine dining, but not, it seems, for its value-for-money.

The NSW capital came in 10th on a list of most expensive cities for tourists.

The list ranked world cities in terms of how much it costs visitors to go out for pre-dinner cocktails, a meal with wine, two short taxi journeys and a one-night stay at a four-star hotel.

In Sydney, the evening expedition costs an average of $404. London was the most expensive city, with the package costing $561, followed by Paris at $550, and New York at $540.

Four-star accommodation was relatively well-priced in Sydney, costing $211 per night, a cheaper rate than London, Paris and New York.

However, Sydney was the third most expensive city in the world for a meal, with a dinner for two people with wine costing $140. The only cities where a dinner out is more expensive are Stockholm and Oslo.

Asian countries were the most affordable for tourists, with Hanoi ranking as the best-value destination at $165 for a night out.

European cities dominated the list, with seven of the ten most expensive cities for tourists coming from the continent.

'However, eastern European countries such as Bulgaria and the Czech Republic seem to be bucking this trend, so may serve as the alternative places for Australian travellers looking for a city break in Europe,' said TripAdvisor spokesman Scott Wegener.

The TripIndex Cities study, compiled by TripAdvisor, compares the cost of an evening out in 48 key tourist cities.
