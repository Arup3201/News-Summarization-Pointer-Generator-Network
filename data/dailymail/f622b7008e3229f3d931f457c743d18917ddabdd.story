The return to form of Raheem Sterling, a change in formation and the emergence of Philipe Coutinho have all contributed to Liverpool's upturn in form. 

However the real reason why Brendan Rodgers' side are now sixth in the Premier League and just two points off the Champions League places, is altogether more powerful and biblical. 

For Liverpool have not lost since Jesus (or a man dressed as Jesus) appeared at Anfield.

The divinely figure showed his support for Rodgers during the club's 2-2 draw with Arsenal at Anfield back on December 21.

The point left Liverpool in 10th, nine points off the top four, and Rodgers facing growing criticism over their stuttering start to the season.

However, since Jesus' appearance at Anfield, Liverpool have not lost in 10 Premier League games - winning seven and drawing three.

Liverpool face Manchester City at Anfield on Sunday and will be hoping their divine intervention continues as they look to continue their push for a Champions League spot.
