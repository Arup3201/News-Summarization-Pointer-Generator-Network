If there is such a thing as football royalty, then David Beckham is surely England's reigning king.

So it was apt that the former Manchester United, Real Madrid, AC Milan, LA Galaxy and Paris Saint-Germain star was spotted at the Royals' HQ on Sunday.

Beckham and wife Victoria were spotted at Reading's training ground at Hogwood Park and posed for pictures with the star-struck Royals players.

The England legend was watching two of his sons, Romeo (12) and Cruz (9), play for two of Arsenal's youth teams against the Royals' own academy sides.

Beckham's eldest son, 15-year-old Brooklyn, has also trained at Arsenal's academy.

'David Beckham in the building, obviously excited to see me. Worldy!' tweeted an excited Hope Akpan, who helped Reading's senior side to a 3-0 victory over Fulham on Saturday.

Young centre back Michael Hector said: 'Me and Sir David Beckham... (I was the) only player he touched! The guy is too fresh.'

'Amazing meeting David Beckham today,' added midfielder Ryan Edwards. 'The biggest legend of the game and one of my idols!'

USA international Danny Williams was also delighted to meet Beckham: 'What a genuine guy. Buzzin' that I have had a chance to finally meet him!'
