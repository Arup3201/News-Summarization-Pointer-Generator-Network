The pretty Phd student who was found dead at her Georgian home was strangled, post mortem tests have revealed.

The body of Carmen Miron-Buchacra, 28, was discovered at the Regency property in Bath, Somerset, which she shared with her partner, investment administrator Paul Keene, 31, who has been charged with her murder.

Keene, 31, appeared before Bath Magistrates Court accused of killing Miss Miron-Buchacra in what is believed to be a domestic incident. He was remanded in custody to appear before Bristol Crown Court on July 10.

Tragic: Carmen Miron-Buchacra, 28, was found dead in Bath, her boyfriend Paul Keene has been charged her murder

Emergency services found Miss Miron-Buchacra strangled at the scene with the couple’s young baby crying nearby.

Police were called to a disturbance at his home just yards from a row of renowned multi-million pound flats -  just after midnight on Sunday.

They discovered the body of Gaby at the beautiful terraced property - which is split into five flats worth around £250,000 each. Post mortem tests have revealed she had been strangled.

Gaby was a fifth year research student at
the University of Bath, where she was studying for an Integrated PhD in
Postgenomic Biosciences.

Dr Richard Hooley, Head of the Department of Biology and Biochemistry, where Gaby studied, paid tribute to Gaby as 'outstanding and gifted'.

He said: 'All of us who had the privilege of working and studying with Gaby are going to miss her very much indeed.

'She was an outstanding and gifted research student and a lively, engaging and caring young woman.'

He added that her death had affected many colleagues and friends on campus.

Neighbours near their home yesterday said the couple had a young baby.

One resident, who did not want to be named, said: 'The police told us that they had an 11-week-old baby.

'I heard from a friend there was lots of drink involved apparently. Police told me they had never been in trouble before.

'It’s so sad. So sad - especially with a baby involved. It’s just awful what can happen, just like that.'

The address is two doors down from the former home of Admiral Phillip, the first governor of Australia, who lived at the address between 1806 and 1814.

It lies opposite The Assembly Rooms, a magnificent 18th century building which is now used as a museum and exclusive wedding venue.

The Circus, a world famous John Wood development and one of the UK’s most prestigious addresses, also lies just 150 yards away.

Revellers on their way home from a night out witnessed the emergency services swarming around the five-storey terraced property.

One
person, who did not wish to be named, said: 'We walked past the 
entrance to Bennett Street at around 1am and there were a number of 
police cars and an ambulance but we didn’t think anything of it.

'When we went past the next day there were still a number of police officers around so we thought this must be serious.

'It is terribly tragic to hear that a woman has died and a man has been arrested.

'Bath is such a nice place and you rarely hear about this sort of thing.'

Local business owner David Price was shocked such a terrible incident could happen in one of the most affluent parts of Bath.

He said: 'All I think is it’s a shame that something like that has happened.'

'They could be the richest person in the world, or the poorest, but you never know what goes on behind closed doors.'

Mr Keene is listed as working as an administrator for Advance Investments Limited, in Bath, since 2007.

On its website, the company claims: 'Paul has become an integral part of the Advance support team.

'With over 10 years experience in different sectors of the Financial Services industry, Paul prides himself on delivering consistently excellent customer service, case management and adviser support with a clear focus on the customer experience.'

His company lists former London Irish, England and British Lions rugby star Mike Catt as a client.

In a testimonial on the website, he says: 'Advance take a professional and integrated view of my investment, pension and taxation affairs.

'I have complete faith in their integrity and ability to deliver a quality and value added service.'

Advance Investments Limited refused to comment on the arrest yesterday.
