Princess Basmah Bint Saud says she is the victim of an attempted blackmail attempt over a video showing her smoking and with her head uncovered. She has gone public rather than pay the £320,000

A Saudi Arabian princess is the victim of a blackmail attempt involving a video of her that could anger and shock the establishment in the hardline Islamic state.

Princess Basmah bint Saud bin Abdulaziz al Saud - more commonly known as Princess Basmah - is being held to ransom by a man who plans to embarrass her with a video - if she does not pay him £320,000.

The video shows her blowing a kiss and smoking with her head uncovered - taboos in strict Saudi Arabia

But rather than bow to the demands of the man, London-based Princess Basmah, who campaigns for human rights in the kingdom, has exposed the extortion attempt on her website and through social media channels.

The plot began while Princess Basmah was on holiday at Christmas at The Gleneagles Hotel in Scotland, according to The Daily Telegraph.

She received a message on Facebook from a man claiming to be a friend, who she refuses to name but described as a sheikh in his 30s from the United Arab Emirates.

She later discovered the account had been hacked by her blackmailer.

She said: 'He sent me a message saying how fascinated he is by my work, how he admired my writings and how I was a hero of the Arab world.'

She continued corresponding and then had a long video conversation via the internet just after Christmas.

'He was a young man. He started getting emotional, saying he would be coming to see me and that I had to see him. He said he was very attracted to me and I started to become suspicious.'

She felt the man, who resembled the sheikh, was trying to entrap her into saying potentially embarrassing things of a sexual nature and confronted him.

She was stunned when he admitted his deception and the fact he was a blackmailer.

'I felt like I was physically beaten up. I felt bruised psychologically and mentally.'

The video shows the 48-year-old mother of five blowing a kiss to the camera and smoking a cigarette while her long brown hair is uncovered.

Her blackmailer has demanded money not to publish the contents of conversations the princess was tricked into having, as well as videos and photographs.

Princess Basmah says the video was stolen from her laptop and has no sound but shows her talking to her son by Skype.

She believes the blackmail attempt is part of a wider conspiracy to discredit both herself and the Saudi Royal Family.

She is also convinced the blackmailer has connections to an anonymous Twitter user called Mujtahidd, who has published intimate details of other members of the Saudi ruling family.

A statement on her website said: 'In light of recent events surrounding HRH Princess Basmah bint Saud, Her Royal Highness wishes to send a message to her detractors that she is here to stay.

'This is a message I want everyone to hear. I want to state clearly that I am a humanitarian not an activist. I do not follow any agendas, only that of humanity, not only in Saudi Arabia, but all over the world.

'I have recently been threatened and blackmailed by a large organisation which has wielded its power to try and destroy my reputation.

'I have recorded these attempts and therefore have evidence which I will publish via social media exposing the attempts to quiet my voice.'

The first three recorded conversations with the attempted blackmailer are published on her Arabic website.

Princess Basmah is the the granddaughter of Saudi Arabia's first king and founder of the modern state, King Abdulaziz, and the 115th daughter of his son King Saud, who reigned from 1953 to 1964.

She describes herself on her website as 'a tireless advocate of peaceful but essential reform in the Kingdom and elsewhere'.
