Fashion has presented a series of challenges for Lorry Newhouse, a designer who established her eponymous label only last year. They are learning curves, she says, that have not been helped by her relations to mega fashion magazine publishing house Condé Nast, which owns titles including Vogue and Glamour.

Mrs Newhouse, the wife of Mark Newhouse (an Advanced Publications newspaper executive and cousin of Condé CEO Si Newhouse), started her brand last year as an impromptu career change, inspired by her love of fashion.

‘I was originally a painter, I actually came out of the film world, I went to Yale film school and [fashion] really evolved from my love of color and texture,’ she told MailOnline by phone on Tuesday.

Bright spot: Lorry Newhouse's designs exhibit an uptown sensibility, and are often fabricated of bright or sequined fabrics to create a dramatic effect (seen here in two looks from her spring 2014 collection)

‘I was always making clothes and people started asking me “Where did you get that dress?” and it really evolved from that.’

In the last twelve months Mrs Newhouse has already placed her made-in-New York designs on Lana Del Rey, Barbara Streisand, and Alyssa Milano, among others. Ireland Baldwin wears one of her ball gowns in the latest issue of DuJour magazine.

Mrs Newhouse’s line has a distinctively uptown flair, and is heavy on the kind of cocktail attire that feels at home within see-and-be-seen social circuit.

Rather than citing historical figures or artists as reference points, Mrs Newhouse says that innovative textiles, predominantly sourced from Italy and France, are driving inspiration behind all of her work.

‘Honestly I get inspired by fabrics,’ she said. ‘I see colors and it has to shine or glow or have a fabulous texture.’

For fall that entails a palette of sequins, metallic taffetas, rich brocades, and assorted laces. Their combined effect may sound overwhelming, but the collection’s classic shapes accommodate Mrs Newhouse’s vision for textural decadence.

Her newest collection for spring 2014-- which debuted this week at New York Fashion Week --offers a smaller range of designs, these ones fabricated of candy-colored taffetas, watercolor florals, and again, more sequins.

‘It’s very Normal Norrell-esque,’ she said of her label’s overall aesthetic, referencing the mid-century American designer who found fame with a line of elegant, over-the-top clothes.

Mrs Newhouse’s spring lookbook is modeled by family friends and relatives, which she says is ‘So much more fun than getting these stick kind of models.’

'I think as a designer, you can 
specialize in one area, make a name for yourself, and then expand later 
on...'

While amply comfortable in the eveningwear arena, Mrs Newhouse not yet found her design footing with everyday clothes. But to her, that is part of the plan.

‘I think as a designer, you can specialize in one area, make a name for yourself, and then expand later on,’ she said of her focus on cocktail attire. ‘In the end it’s about staying in the game as long as possible and getting your name out there.’

It’s a task that Mrs Newhouse says she 
is tackling all on her own. ‘I married into the Newhouse family…it 
really hasn’t helped that much, we have had great media coverage but 
very little from Newhouse publications except WWD,’ she told us.

Mrs Newhouse also says that her label has taken more of an exhausting effort than she had perhaps expected.

In New York, emerging fashion designers are typically quite young, a stigma that Mrs Newhouse attributes to the fact that ‘you do need that youth to have the stamina to be able to sustain the kind of energy it takes to do this.’

While she would not disclose her exact age (she did admit to being well past thirty), Mrs Newhouse says that she has found the fashion industry to be ‘on steroids right now.’

Elaborating she told us: ‘there is a lot of pressure to put out enough product and enough designs, which is why I keep this a really small enterprise right now. I’d be very happy keeping it small and less commercial.’

Her fashion week presentation, however, has attracted attention from department store buyers. At present, Mrs Newhouse is only retailed through a handful of specialty shops. She says that most of her sales come through private clients.

‘It’s sink or swim for me,’ she said. ‘The Newhouses are very ethical—there is business and there is family and the two don’t get combined ever,’ she continued.

‘That’s the only way to do a business.’
