Two disabled brothers face eviction from their childhood home because the council says the property is too big for them since their parents died of cancer. 

Clive Samson, 50, and his 49-year-old brother Peter, lived with their mother and father in a three-bedroom council house in Betsham, near Southfleet in Kent.

But they lost their father Geoffrey, a former RAF serviceman, to pancreatic cancer in December 2012 before his wife of more than 50 years, Yvonne, succumbed to breast cancer and lymphoma just months later at the age of 72.

The tenancy of the Samsons' semi-detached 1930s property was in Mrs Samson's name.

Clive applied to Dartford Council for the lease to pass on to the next generation but has been told he and Peter must pack-up and leave the family home as they now have a spare bedroom which the council feels other tenants could fill.

Clive, who has been unable to work for four years and struggles to walk because he suffers from arthritis and tendinosis, said: 'It would be devastating if we had to leave.

'The council just see two people have died and think "we want our house back".

'It just seems pretty callous.

'They said they would look into it and do everything they could to help us stay here - ha ha.' 

Peter has long suffered from anxiety, panic attacks and agoraphobia, and moving from the area would force him to give up the part time work he has in the village doing odd jobs for a family friend.

The former mechanical engineer said: 'We are still grieving and have a whole house of our parents' things we haven't even been through yet.

'I understand the council has a problem with not having enough properties but how does making our lives a misery help anyone?'

Greenhithe and Swanscombe Royal British Legion branch treasurer Graham Mentor-Morris said: 'From a legion point of view we find it absolutely disgusting that two people of this age and disabled are likely to be ejected from the house where they have lived for all their lives.

'The fact that the family has lived there for 50 years ought to count for something.'

A Dartford Council spokesman said: 'We’re not a callous council and we’re not looking to apply some rigid policy when a common-sense solution would sort things out for Peter and Clive at a difficult time for them. 

'We are required to respect their privacy on some aspects of the brothers’ situation which haven’t been disclosed and which might explain what we are doing and why. 

'We are far more interested in helping Peter and Clive than we are in bureaucracy and it sounds like we need to step out from behind the desk and go out to see them urgently, which we are always more than happy to do. 

'Hopefully we can reassure them.'
