With a new season just weeks away, the country’s brief respite from Premier League football is almost over.

But despite the wall-to-wall media coverage and the millions of pounds paid to its stars, England’s top football league comes a distant second to the theatre when it comes to paying customers.

A study has found that more people attend plays and musicals at London’s theatres each year than Premier League games across the country.

Shows including A Midsummer Night’s Dream (above starring Sheridan Smith), the Lion King and the Mousetrap pulled in an astonishing 22million spectators in just one year

Shows including A Midsummer Night’s Dream, the Lion King and the Mousetrap pulled in an astonishing 22million spectators in just one year.

By comparison, just under 14million football fans attended the 380 Premier League matches last season.

The study, commissioned by the National Theatre and the Society of London Theatre, asked every licensed theatre in London to provide attendance and box office figures.

During 2011/12, 21million people attended theatres in London, bringing in an estimated £609million. This increased by 5.2 per cent to 22million (£619million) in 2012/13.

But football figures showed just 13,944,100 fans attended all Premier League matches last season.

The domestic football season only runs from August to May, whereas long-running shows at the theatre can be shown twice a day and up to seven days a week.

The 2012/13 analysis showed there were 241 professional theatres in London, with more than 110,000 seats between them.

Alistair Smith, the editor of trade paper The Stage, who undertook the study, told the Daily Mail: ‘It is an interesting comparison, which shows that more people like going to see live theatre than going to watch the football. London theatre also takes more at the box office than London’s cinemas.’

Nick Starr, the National’s executive director, said: ‘While there has been for some time an awareness that London is a world city for theatre, we’ve hitherto lacked the data to see just how big it is.

‘These are valuable insights not only for the capital, but also nationally and internationally — and valuable, too, I hope, for policy-makers.’

Venues surveyed ranged from the 30-seat Lord Stanley pub in Camden to the 3,600-seat Hammersmith Apollo.

The report identified 59 commercial theatres, 47 fringe venues and 135 not-for-profit theatres such as the Globe and the National.

Two London boroughs – Ealing and Bexley – had no permanent professional theatre. Westminster accounted for a third of London’s theatre capacity.

The commercial West End accounted for just over half of capacity and the majority of box office. Arts Council-backed theatres accounted for a third of all tickets sold.

At £21.24, average prices for Arts-Council-backed theatres were cheaper than the West End, where the average figure was £36.05. Fringe tickets – bought by 586,000 people – were around £10.

In 2012 a total of 43million people went to the cinema. Given the average cinema ticket is £6.37, far more money is spent at the theatre.

London’s theatres employ more than 3,000 performers at any one time, another 6,500 full-time non-performing staff and thousands of others.
