Arsene Wenger has insisted it was his choice not to re-sign Cesc Fabregas despite the Chelsea midfielder angling for a move back to north London.

The Gunners had first refusal on their captain after he left to join Barcelona in the summer of 2011.

But Wenger turned down the chance to move for the the Spaniard, allowing rivals Chelsea to swoop in a £30million deal last summer.

The midfielder has since flourished at Stamford Bridge turning in a number of impressive displays to help fire the Blues to the summit of the Premier League table while his family have clearly taken no time at all to settle back into life in London.

Fabregas' girlfriend Daniella Semaan took to Instagram to share a family snap ahead of his big game on Sunday and posted the words: 'I live for you and you and you'.

When asked if Fabregas’s first choice was a return to Arsenal, Wenger replied: ‘Certainly, yes. But when he left we bought Mesut Ozil. We have Santi Cazorla, Jack Wilshere and we were not in the need to buy offensive players.'

Arsenal face Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Sunday and Wenger admitted he still ‘loves’ the Spain star, who spent eight years with the north London club. He also called on the travelling Arsenal supporters to give their former captain a warm reception.

Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho is hopeful noise from the Blues fans will drown out '3,000 red fans'

The Spanish midfielder has scored one goal and picked up seven assists since the start of the season

Wenger said: 'Cesc will have a great career because he is a great player. We had a very positive influence on his career. After that, I hope everyone feels we had a positive influence. 

'I have no animosity against Fabregas. He is a player I love. We are all professional people and we have to accept that he left.

'He will get a respectful welcome. Everyone respects Cesc here and I want him to get he welcome he deserves.'

Meanwhile, Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho believes the reception Fabregas receives from Arsenal fans will be insignificant if the home supporters get behind the former Gunner.

Mourinho said: 'If Chelsea fans want, the reaction from Arsenal fans, nobody will listen. It depends on Chelsea fans.

'If 40,000 blue fans want, no-one will listen to 3,000 red fans. It depends on the club culture. As you saw with Chelsea fans and Frank Lampard.

He added: 'Fabregas was – I don’t say born – but made at Arsenal and the feeling should be good between the fans and him but I don’t know.'
