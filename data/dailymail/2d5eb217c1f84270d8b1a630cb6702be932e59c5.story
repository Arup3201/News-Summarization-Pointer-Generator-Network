Callous: Sonia Eyres secretly looted housebound victim's home while he lay in bed

A prolific criminal who stole from an elderly, one-legged man after he mistakenly thought she had entered his house to deliver food has been jailed.

Sonia Eyres, 42 crept into the bedroom of the 63-year old housebound victim as he lay asleep and stole his wallet just hours after two carers had visited the property.

The frail man woke up and spotted Eyres but he assumed she was from the delivery service and inadvertently allowed her to prowl around his home.

The carers returned at lunchtime and became suspicious when the victim claimed Meals on Wheels had been to give him lunch.

They checked his bedroom and discovered his wallet containing £510 cash had been taken.

The raid occurred on August 5 after workers visited his home in Poulton-le-Fylde near Blackpool, Lancashire, to check on him.

Before they left, the unnamed victim asked them to leave the door on the latch because he was feeling unwell and wanted any visitors to let themselves in, so he did not have to go to the door himself.

The man did not know Eyres and had not invited her in. Assuming she was an employee of the meals on wheels service, he asked her whether she was delivering a week’s worth of provisions for him.

But Eyres failed to correct his assumption and instead she asked to use the toilet. She then left with his wallet which had been left on a bedside table.

Eyres, from Blackpool, Lancs, was given a three year prison sentence she pleaded guilty to burglary.

Preston Crown Court was told she was a serial burglar who had previously carried out nine other similar sneak thefts.

In February last year she was given a 30 month sentence for similar burglaries against vulnerable victims.

In
one raid she pretended to be a pet lover looking for a lost dog and and
snatched a cheque book, stamps and a black leather pension book whilst 
an elderly man was fetching her a glass of water.

Police carried out a forensic examination of the scene and matched a footprint to Eyre’s trainers. In mitigation she claimed she was in poor physical and mental health due to a drug habit.

But Judge Michael Byrne told her: 'This is a bad case. You took advantage of a vulnerable victim'.

Det Sgt Fiona Jackson of Lancashire Police said 'This was a disgraceful crime where Eyres has taken advantage of a vulnerable victim’s circumstances.

'Eyres should be ashamed of herself, and I welcome the custodial sentence given to her.

'Burglary offences in Lancashire are low, but I would urge all of our residents to take every opportunity they can to make their homes as secure as possible.

'In particular, something as simple as making sure your doors are locked will always help to keep burglars out.

'As part of improving their chances of not becoming a victim of burglary, I would also encourage our residents to fit door chains to their front doors if possible so they can safely check callers before letting them in too.'
