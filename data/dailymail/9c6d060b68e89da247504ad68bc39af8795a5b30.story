Dog killer: Michael David Parker was sentenced to 16 months in California state prison Monday after admitting to running over his wife's dog in the middle of their divorce

A man in southern California was sentenced to 16 years in prison Monday for running over and killing his wife's Chihuahua named Cow-Cow in the middle of their bitter divorce.

Michael David Parker was caught committing the heartless act on a surveillance camera installed in a Hawthorne alleyway.

The video shows the 45-year-old driving into an alley on December 28 and getting something out of the trunk of his car.

Cow-Cow is seen scurrying in front of the video and into the middle of the alley while Parker gets back into the car.

Parker backs the car up before quickly speeding over the helpless 5-year-old dog, which tries and fails to move out of the way.

The car is then seen exiting the alleyway while Cow-Cow lays motionless on the ground.

A passerby later saw the dog, placed it in a bag and moved the carcass to the side of the alleyway.

Another person noticed the body a week later by the smell.

Hawthorne Police used the surveillance footage to get the car's license plate number which they then traced back to Parker and he was arrested on January 3.

'It's just shocking to see a little animal like that and to see this guy â€” you can actually see him drive toward the dog,' Hawthorne Police Lt Scott Swain told the Los Angeles Times at the time of the arrest. 'We come across weird things, strange things, gruesome things, but even to us, to see something like this is shocking.

Parker initially said the dog's death was an accident, but pleaded no contest last Friday after taking a plea deal.

Under the deal, two other charges against Parker were dropped which could have landed him behind bars for more than five years.
