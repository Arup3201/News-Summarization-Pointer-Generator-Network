Australian scientists have made a break through discovery where they can control the growth of seafood and cancer cells - which may ultimately lead to a cure.

This finding was based on the knowledge that an Ecuadorian dwarf community is immune to both cancer and diabetes.

Researcher was undertaken since it was identified that their cells lack a receptor necessary for a growth hormone to enter.

A group of Ecuadorians with Laron syndrome are completely free of diabetes and cancer. The research helped the recent discovery of ways to control cell growth by Australian scientists

Professor Mike Waters has been working towards this for 20 years, when he started with the biotechnology company Genentech to clone the receptor.

'People without the receptor don't die from cancer or diabetes,' said the professor who's now the research leader at University of Queensland's Institute for Molecular Bioscience.

Since then Mr Waters has been trying to understand how it works and more importantly, how to switch it on and off.

The finding could create a hormone-free method of farming larger seafood such as lobsters

The professor and his team explained the process in an article in the journal Science published on Friday.

'We have discovered how growth hormone works at the molecular level,' he said.

'This means we can control the processes of growth. We can stop them. We can start them.'

So far it's taken 45 years but the research could lead to a drug that stunts the spread of many forms of cancer.

A by-product of the work is a potential hormone-free improvement to fish farming: 'We can put the active receptor into fish or lobster or prawns.'

If the receptor is left in the 'on' position, the seafood will grow bigger faster.

This is experimental work and has not yet been used commercially or on land animals.

In medicine, it could be possible to emulate the cancer immunity of the dwarves, known as Laron dwarfs.

This could be done by developing a drug to switch the growth receptor off or remove it completely.

So in simple terms - stop the cancer growing and spreading, or kill it.

This could also lead to a new class of fine-tuned treatments with limited side effects, according to study co-leader Dr Andrew Brooks said.

The discovery could have implications for other conditions including inflammatory bowel disease, blood disorders, osteoporosis and obesity.
