President Barack Obama said during a Thursday press conference that his administration doesn't have a plan worked out yet for defeating the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) in Syria.

'I don't want to put the cart before the horse,' Obama said at the White House. 'We don't have a strategy yet.'

'We need to make sure we've got clear plans, and we're developing them,' he said. 'At that point I will consult with Congress and make sure their voices are heard.'

'What I've seen in some of the news reports suggests that folks are getting a little further ahead of where we're at than we currently are,' Obama cautioned.

No strategy: Obama said Thursday that he hasn't settled on a direction in Syria as ISIS solidifies its bases there despite losing ground to US airstrikes in Iraq

He mentioned four times his intention to seek advice from Capitol Hill before deploying more military assets in the Middle East, likely in response to concerns from members of the House and Senate that he was unconstitutionally freezing them out.

But 'there's no point in me asking for action on the part of Congress,' Obama told the press corps, 'before I know exactly what it is that is going to be required for us to get the job done.'

The president, clad in a muted tan suit that drew as many comments on Twitter as the content of his remarks, emphasized that he is mainly focused now on pushing back ISIS in Iraq, where American military jets and drones have executed more than 100 airstrikes this month.

But he boasted that America could put down the ISIS threat in Syria – at least in the short-term – at a time of his choosing.

'As I've said before – I think I said it in the previous press conference,' he said, 'our military is the best in the world.'

'We can rout ISIL on the ground and keep a lid on things temporarily, he insisted, referring to ISIS by the White House's preferred name. 'But then as soon as we leave, the same problems come back again.'

'My priority at this point is to make sure that the gains that ISIL made in Iraq are rolled back and that Iraq has the opportunity to govern itself effectively and secure itself,' the president said.

The vicious terrorist group has its most comfortable stronghold in Syria, leaving open the possibility that defeating them in Iraq could leave them more entrenched one nation to the west – in a country that shares a hotly contested border with Israel, a key U.S. ally.

The administration has green-lighted surveillance flyovers across portions of eastern Syria in recent days to assess ISIS's numbers and evaluate potential military targets.

White House aides have leaked to a variety of news outlets the idea that Obama is considering striking ISIS in Syria despite objections from the country's dictator, Bashar al-Assad.

Syria is in general disarray as rebels from a range of moderate and militant Islamist groups have fought a civil war for more than three years with the aim of taking over the country. 

ISIS is among the groups that oppose Assad. Crushing them could strengthen the barbaric regime in Damascus, and vice versa.

Dealing with that conundrum 'is going to be a long-term project,' Obama said. 'It's going to require us to stabilize Syria in some fashion' but identifying moderate Sunni Muslims who can govern the country. 

Expanding his Iraq campaign to a second country, though, could highlight his administration's failure to intervene a year ago after Obama warned Assad about the consequences of crossing a 'red line' by deploying chemical weapons against the rebels.

He said Thursday that he has directed Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and the military's Joint Chiefs of Staff 'to prepare a range of options' for him.

A Pew Research Center poll released Thursday found that 54 per cent of Americans believe Obama isn't tough enough with foreign adversaries. They rank ISIS among the top foreign threats to the U.S. 

'While overall his job rating has remained stable this year (currently 42% approve, 50% disapprove),' Pew reported, 'he gets his best rating for handling race relations and more negative ratings for handling policy toward Israel, the situation in Russia and Ukraine, and Iraq.'

Nearly half of Americans, 48 per cent, told pollsters that America 'is a less important and powerful world leader than it was 10 years ago,' according to Pew.

Just 15 per cent said its importance globally has grown during the Obama administration, a number that is near a 40-year low.
