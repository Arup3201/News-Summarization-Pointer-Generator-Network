Killed: Gospel singer Roy Bray, 61, was killed when the RV he was driving came off the road in Indiana

The singer for an old-fashioned Southern gospel band died after the RV he was driving the band in crashed in the early hours of the morning.

Roy Bray, a 61-year-old baritone with the Southmen Quartet, was driving the band back from a performance in Indiana when the vehicle came off the freeway and crashed into a tree yesterday morning.

The RV was traveling south on I-65 in Lebanon, Indiana, when it hit a wooden median, 'totaling' the bus, a surviving member said.

Bray, from Trenton, Kentucky, was pronounced dead at the scene. Another member, lead singer Jim Hefner, 72, was injured and taken to hospital.

A statement from the local Sheriff's department said his injuries aren't life-threatening.

The other members - Johny Washburn and Donnie Marr - escaped unharmed. The cause of the crash remains unclear.

Marr described the incident in a post on his Facebook page.

He wrote: 'As The Southmen Quartet was traveling to Nashville for our last concert for the weekend, tragedy hit us. Traveling down I65 south in Lebanon, IN, our bus left the road and traveled approximately 200 feet before hitting a tree head on totaling our bus.

'Our piano player/baritone singer Roy Bray was driving the bus and took the brunt of the impact and was tragically killed. Owner Jim Hefner has been admitted to the hospital for further evaluation. Johny Washburn and myself walked away with few or no scratches.

Onstage: Bray was a baritone singer and a pianist for the Southmen Quartet, with whom he was on tour

'We ask each one of you to pray for the Southmen and families thru this difficult time and especially for Roy - our brother, partner, friend, father, and husband, and his sweet family!'

The band played a concert at the Trinity United Methodist Church in Kentland, Indiana, Saturday night.

They were scheduled to play at the Lavergne, Miracle Baptist Chuch in Lavergne, Tennessee, which would have been their 60th concert this year.

The group was heading south after a performance in the northern Indiana town of Shipshewana.

Performing: Bray is seen left singing alongside other members of the Southmen Quartet

Bray had been involved in gospel music since the 1960s, and toured around the country - and to Canada - with the Southmen Quartet. He described his 'mission in life' as 'to seek and save the lost'.

Writing on the group's website in 2012, Bray said: 'I have been involved in southern gospel music in many ways since 1966, and I'd have to admit that I'm not easily impressed, but wow; what a time I've had traveling and performing with The Southmen!'

'I count it an honor and a blessing to work the type churches and venues in which The Southmen perform and, best of all we are seeing souls saved, lives changed and, Christians re-dedicating their lives to The Lord. What more could a gospel musician/singer ask for?'
