Forget the bragging rights - victory in Sunday's Liverpool vs Manchester United clash could be worth as much as £70million.

While nothing will be decided in the latest installment of the old rivalry, at 3.20pm we will be a lot closer to knowing who will be in pole position to land a treasured place in the top four and the Champions League qualification that brings.

The victors can look forward to a £70m cash bonanza from appearing on Europe's biggest stage thanks to the TV money and gate receipts that brings.

Group participation: £6.3million

Win bonus: £720,000

Draw: £362,000

Qualification to round of 16: £2.54m

Quarter-Finals: £2.83m

Semi-Finals: £3.55m

Winners: £7.61m

Runners-up: £4.71m

Gate receipts per match (United): £2m

Gate receipts per match (Liverpool): £1.5m

(Numbers based on 2013/14 figures)

The losers, however, may be advised to find out what number ITV4 is on their TV boxes and brace themselves for the prospect of a fraction of that sum from the Europa League.

In the packed stands it will all be about what happens on the pitch.

In the directors box, however, officials will no doubt be calculating the rewards of glorious victory and the cost of miserable defeat.

Should Louis van Gaal's visitors triumph in the early kick-off they will stretch the gap on Liverpool to five points with eight matches to play. Victory for Brendan Rodgers's resurgent Reds would see them take over fourth spot by a point.

A draw and the advantage remains with the visitors from the other end of the Ship Canal.

While officials from both clubs are desperate to make the Champions League, failure to do so would do more damage to the Old Trafford coffers.

There has been plenty at stake in previous matches, but Champions League money is now bigger than ever

United, perennial participants, are already counting the cost of this year's non-participation.

Figures recently released reveal that they are set to see a drop in revenue of around £50m as a result of their inability to qualify under David Moyes.

Should they repeat the trick this year that figure will rise to around £70m thanks to the new TV deal with BT Sport which is worth an extra £20m.

Then there is United's £750m kit deal with adidas. That features a £22.5m penalty should they fail to qualify for the Champions League for two consecutive seasons. If the unthinkable happens, the loss would hit a staggering £100m.

David Moyes' failure to reach the top four last season has made success imperative this time around

Liverpool got a taste of the Champions League this season, and will want the same again in 2015-16

The impact another year without Champions League football would have on existing and potential sponsors cannot be quantified but it could run into the millions.

United have a vast commercial operation with offices in Manchester, Mayfair and Hong Kong aimed at squeezing every penny out of their global brand.

While they could label one year without Champions League football as a one-off, investors may see two years of non-qualification as more of a trend.

That logic would no doubt spread to the New York Stock Exchange where failure to qualify could have an impact on the club's share price.

United are used to European success, and will want to recreate nights like this - Moscow in May 2008

Much of their success came under Sir Alex Ferguson (centre), and they have struggled since his retirement

In 2013-14, when United were knocked out by Bayern Munich in the quarter finals, they picked up £31.3m in broadcasting money alone.

As for prize money, UEFA pay around £800,000 for each win and £415,000 for a draw.

There is also the extra gate receipts, although this would be offset by an appearance in the Europa League.

Season ticket holders at United commit to buying tickets for European matches and they would be looking to pick up around £2m per game.

All of the above would help both clubs when it comes to complying with Financial Fair Play regulations.

However, the latest, staggering £5bn TV deal for Premier League TV rights is a game changer.

United privately believe that could give them the clout to finally overtake Real Madrid and end the talent drain that saw Cristiano Ronaldo and David Beckham depart Old Trafford for the Bernabeu.

There is not only  Champions League cash up for grabs.

At the end of the season the Premier League dishes out 'merit' money based on finishing position.

Last year the difference between Arsenal, who finished fourth and Everton, who finished fifth, was £1.24m.

Liverpool and United are seemingly out of the title race. This is not a battle for honours but the match is set to be the most-viewed of the season.

It will be broadcast to 645 million homes across 175 countries with the global fanbase enjoyed by both a major factor.

There is much more than three points at stake, but then there always has been.

Thanks to TV money and gate receipts, reaching the Champions League places will earn the victors a £70million cash bonanza

Failure to reach the top four would damage Manchester United's coffers more than it would Liverpool, after their failure under David Moyes too
