An estate agent bravely came to the rescue of a neighbouring jeweller after two armed robbers disguised in full-length burkas held him up at gunpoint.

Kevin Hannan leapt onto the bonnet of the raider's getaway car and was dragged 20 yards down the road as he attempted to stop the pair making their escape after they threatened to shoot next door shopkeeper Haroon Qureshi.

The thugs - who only had their eyes visible - pistol-whipped Mr Qureshi and ordered the father-of-four to fill a supermarket bag with £30,000 of jewels as they pointed their weapon at his wife Uzma, 35, and three-year-old daughter.

Brave: Estate agent Kevin Hannan gets in the way of the getaway car in an attempt to stop the pair fleeing the scene

Terrifying: But instead of stopping, the pair plough into the father-of-one and carry him 20 yards down the street while he clings on to the bonnet

Flee: When Mr Hannan is finally flung to the ground, the pair speed off and remain at large

But they fled empty-handed when Mr Qureshi, 41, refused their demands, and then chased after them out of the shop.

The raiders leapt into a waiting black Fiat 500 but were confronted by Mr Hannan, 34, who stood in the car's path. 

CCTV captured the moment they accelerated forward and threw the father-of-one onto the bonnet.

He was carried along for 20 yards before being flung to the ground.

Mr Hannan said: 'I heard all the 
commotion and then saw two figures in burkas running off with Haroon 
chasing them and shouting 'stop, robbers!"

Lucky: Estate agent Kevin Hannan tried to stop the robbers by standing 
in front of their getaway car.  Mr Qureshi stands outside his shop

'One of the men had the top of his burka missing and was wearing a balaclava over his face.

'So I stood in front of their car and raised my hands shouting 'stop'. Instead they drove straight at me and I had to leap on to the bonnet.'

The duo are still at large.

Reliving his ordeal, Mr Qureshi said: 'You have to live life like a lion, not a jackal.

'I didn't have time to be scared, but I would do the same if it happened again.'

Pistol: Moments before Mr Hannan's ordeal, Haroon Qureshi had seen of the two robbers, who were armed with a gun

Terrifying: The robbers point a gun in the father's face demanding he empty the shop of jewels

Lion versus jackals: Rather than handover the jewellery to the robbers, Mr Quereshi confronts them

Tustle: Mr Qureshi forces both robbers out of the shop despite one of them ordering the other to shoot him

He learned how to handle a gun while doing army training in his native Pakistan and added: 'I wasn't just going to give 
everything away like that. I was angry so I tried to grab his gun.

'He hit me across the shoulders with the gun and then tried to break the glass on the jewellery display case.

'I began wrestling and pushing him. Then as the men turned to flee I pulled off the top of his burka.

'He
had a balaclava underneath. I don't think either man was Asian - the 
first had a West Indian accent and I think the second was white.'

Formidable: Haroon Qureshi lived to tell the tale of his terrifying ordeal at the hands of the armed robbers

Action: The father-of-one heard his neighbour's cries for help and jumped to his aid, but was forced onto the bonnet of their car

His
brother Mansoor, 29, who owns the Asian Gold jewellery store in Milton 
Keynes, Buckinghamshire, said: 'Haroon thought maybe it was a fake gun, 
but he didn't know for sure.

'So he managed to get the raider away from his daughter Suda and then began arguing with him and shouting.

'The other robber shouted to his colleague to shoot both Haroon and Suda, but instead he panicked and they both fled.'

Thames Valley Police are appealing for witnesses to the raid at 2.10pm on July 31.

A
spokesman said: 'One of the offenders was seen carrying a firearm, but 
it is yet to be ascertained whether the firearm was genuine or an 
imitation.'
