Sir Alex Ferguson took in his second Champions League match in a week, travelling to the Etihad  to see Manchester City's 2-1 defeat against Barcelona.

The former United boss was spotted by television cameras enjoying the clash and was joined in the stands by Roy Hodgson, Ryan Giggs, Nicky Butt, Adam Lallana, Jordan Henderson and Mike Summerbee. 

Sir Alex was also in attendance for Chelsea's draw at Paris Saint-Germain and was awkwardly on the same flight as his former captain Roy Keane - with neither acknowledging the other.
