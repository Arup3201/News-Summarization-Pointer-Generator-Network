Newcastle’s squad has been hit by illness on the eve of their Capital One Cup tie at Crystal Palace.

The Magpies will be without weekend goal hero Papiss Cisse, goalkeeper Tim Krul and French forward Yoan Gouffran for the trip to South London.

Cisse was coughing and spluttering in the wake of his point-saving double against Hull on Saturday, and Krul and Gouffran have now also fallen sick.
