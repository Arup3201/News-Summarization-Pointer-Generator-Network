The Department of
Justice is expected not to charge Darren Wilson, the officer whose killing of unarmed teenager Mike Brown led to protests in Ferguson and throughout the country, CNN reports.

The outlet said Justice Department officials are, however, planning to sue the Ferguson Police Department for racially discriminatory practices unless the department agrees to make changes.

The shooting of Brown became one of the focal points in the debate over unjust policing in the United States and led to a federal probe of both the incident and the Ferguson police department. 

Lawsuit: Eric Holder's Justice Department is expected not to charge Darren Wilson, the officer whose killing of unarmed teenager Mike Brown led to protests in Ferguson and throughout the country, CNN reports

After a St Louis County grand jury decided not to indict and Missouri authorities concluded an investigation without recommending charges, the federal probe is the only remaining investigation probing whether to charge Wilson. 

Justice Department spokesman Peter Carr did not provide a comment for the CNN report.

Attorney General Eric Holder said earlier this week at a National Press Club event he is 'confident' there will be a decision before the nominee to be his replacement, Loretta Lynch, is confirmed by the Senate.

The discriminatory tactics under review by the department include the department's alleged targeting and jailing of minorities for traffic violations.

The St Louis Post-Dispatch reported that former St Louis County Police Chief Tim Fitch believes the Justice Department will make a civil rights lawsuit a 'consolation prize' when it clears Wilson of charges. 

The department insists that both investigations 'continue to be conducted separate of each other,' according to spokeswoman Dena Iverson. 

Outrage: The shooting of Brown occurred the same year that accusations of police brutality were brought against the officers who killed unarmed black men such as Eric Garner and Akai Gurley

Protests: The narrative around the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown became contested, with some witnesses saying he was kneeling and holding his hands up, others claiming he charged the officer

According to a civil suit already filed against both Ferguson and nearby Jennings, residents who had outstanding fines for traffic tickets and other minor offenses were thrown in 'debtors' prisons.'

MSNBC reported that over the last several years, police stopped black motorists at twice the rate of white motorists in Ferguson, though whites were more likely to be in possession of contraband.

'Many towns in our region attempt to squeeze every dollar possible out of defendants and their families by jailing citizens who are not criminals,' said Thomas Harvey, executive director of ArchCity Defenders, who brought the suit on behalf of 15 plaintiffs.

'Although these practices are not new, many in the region just recently became aware of the ways in which municipal courts make people poor and keep them poor, especially in communities of color.'

The report did not go into further details about the pattern of abuses alleged in the Department of Justice lawsuit.

CNN did say that the agency would impose court supervision of the Ferguson Police Department in order to ensure changes were carried out.
