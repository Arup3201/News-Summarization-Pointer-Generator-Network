Three military-trained dolphins have gone AWOL from the Ukrainian Navy - apparently in search of love.

The marine mammals, who can attack enemies using guns and knives strapped to their head, failed to return after a training exercise near the port of Sevastopol in the Black Sea.

But Yury Plyachenko, a former Soviet naval anti-sabotage officer, said he believes they have probably left to find a mate and will soon return.

Mr Plyachenko, said based on his experience in the Cold War, he expects the amorous dolphins to return.

'If
a male dolphin saw a female dolphin during the mating season, then he 
would immediately set off after her. But they came back in a week or 
so,' he said.

The Ukrainian Defence Ministry has denied the reports that the dolphins have gone missing, or that such a unit even exists.

Reports emerged last year that the Ukraine was planning to start training dolphins for military action, a tactic made famous in the Soviet era.

During the Cold War, dolphins were trained by the Soviet Navy at Sevastopol, to locate mines on the seabed and attack divers.

They could also carry explosives on their heads to plant them on enemy ships.

When the USSR collapsed two decades 
ago they were redeployed to work with disabled children.

The former top secret military base on the Crimean peninsula became a leading place for dolphin-therapy - a controversial alternative technique to soothe ailments - after the Soviet collapse.

New purpose: The dolphins at Sevastopol had been redeployed to help treat children with disabilities such as cerebral palsy

Dolphins who previously were engaged in military service turned their highly trained minds away from office to helping cure children with a range of problems from nightmares to autism to cerebral palsy.

The U.S. Navy also trained dolphins for military use in Virginia as part of its Marine Mammal Program.

But the Ukraine's plans to resurrect the elite unit has suffered an embarrassing setback with the disappearance of the love-sick trio.
