Alan Pardew fears goalkeeper Rob Elliot will miss the entire festive programme after suffering a torn thigh muscle.

The 28-year-old was undergoing a scan on Monday to reveal the extent of the damage which forced him off at half-time during Saturday’s 2-1 win over Chelsea.

But Pardew believes Elliot will be out until the New Year, meaning he misses the games against Arsenal, Spurs, Sunderland, Manchester United and Everton.

Young goalkeeper Jak Alnwick came on to replace Elliot at half-time in his debut for Newcastle

Alnwick, 21, was called upon in the second half on several occasions for the hosts 

‘That’ll be him until January,’ said Pardew, who is also without ankle-victim Tim Krul until the end of January.

‘Both No1 and No2 are out, and we’re now on No3.’

Jak Alnwick was Elliot’s replacement at the weekend and the 21-year-old – who was making his Newcastle debut – will now start for the first time in the Premier League at Arsenal on Saturday.
