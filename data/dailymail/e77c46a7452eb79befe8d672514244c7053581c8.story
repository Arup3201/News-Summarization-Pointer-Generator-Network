Joe Hart has signed a long-term contract worth £120,000 a week that ties the England goalkeeper to Manchester City until 2019.

Hart was widely expected to become the latest player to agree a new deal with the Premier League champions and the news was confirmed on Friday night.

‘Wanting to stay here was never going to be an issue for me. I’ve loved every moment since I joined,’ said Hart, who has made 276 appearances since signing from Shrewsbury Town in 2006.

‘The club’s doing amazing things. We’ve created history and we want to keep doing that. The club’s growing and I’ve been really lucky to be part of the ride. We’re enjoying building that winning mentality, how the club is growing around us and how we need to grow along with it.’

City, who also expect James Milner to agree a new deal soon, have won their last seven games in all competitions and could feasibly replace Chelsea at the top of the table on goal difference with an emphatic win at home to Crystal Palace in today’s lunchtime kick-off.

Manuel Pellegrini’s team trailed Chelsea by nine points at one stage last month, and the City boss warned Jose Mourinho’s side that Arsenal blew their chance from a similar position last season.

The Gunners occupied top spot in December after 16 games and then fell away in the second half of the campaign as City emerged to become champions.

‘You never win a title in December,’ said Pellegrini. ‘Maybe you can be the best team but you don’t know what will happen in the second half.

‘I think Arsenal had a very similar number of points last season as Chelsea have now so we’ll see what happens in the second half and how many points you need to win.’

Asked what psychological impact relinquishing such a big lead might have on Chelsea, Pellegrini replied: ‘I don’t know but in our team we always fight to the end and are never beaten until mathematics say you cannot win.

‘We always believed that we could make up the points because we had so many games to play.

‘You may remember last year when we had just five games left and knew that we had to win them, we did it.’

Hart has made 276 appearances for the club, winning the Premier League, FA Cup, and League Cup
