While most people across America will be still be humming Aud Lang Syne and making resolutions to be a better person on New Year’s Day, thieves are seizing the opportunity to steal cars.

According to a recent report, New Year’s Day is the most popular day for automobile theft, as many cars are sitting unattended in lots as their owners are most likely nursing a hangover far away.

The numbers don’t lie – 2,347 cars were stolen last New Year’s Day alone, a report says.

No New Years resolutions? New Year's Day is the most popular for car thieves, a report says

The National Insurance Crime Bureau says that thieves jump on the opportunity to pluck a car away on a day where many cars are ripe for the taking.

‘Thieves never miss an opportunity to make a quick buck by stealing a car,’ NICB president Joe Wehrle said.

‘They work nights, weekends and holidays and ironically, they are particularly busy on New Year’s Day and Memorial Day.’

The NICB cautioned in their news release: ‘While Americans are enjoying the holidays and most have time off from work, we need to remember that holidays are just another day at the shop for vehicle thieves.’

Surprising: The 1994 Honda Accord was the most popular car to steal in 2010

In some cases, it takes less than two minutes for a carjacker to take a vehicle.

Car owners may be surprised to learn that most burglars don’t target high-end - or even new - cars.

According to the NICB, the most stolen car in 2010 was the 1994 Honda Accord, a low to mid-range compact vehicle.

The bureau recommends parking your car in a safe, well-lit area and also reminds drivers of a few seemingly obvious pointers – like taking the keys out of the ignition and not hiding them anywhere in or around the vehicle.

To slow down would-be thieves, the NICB also recommends additional security measures aside from car alarms. 

Applying the emergency break, turning the wheels hard to the left or right, and putting the car in the parking gear are all ways to deter potential robbers from towing your car.

A total of 20,995 vehicles were stolen on holidays during 2010, compared to 22,991 reported stolen the year before.
