A hand-held gadget that costs less than an iPhone is offering new freedom to millions of Britons on ‘blood-thinning’ medicine.

The drugs, the most common of which is warfarin, are given to those with a variety of heart and circulatory problems.

But they require constant monitoring to help limit severe side effects, such as heavy bruising and internal bleeding, and often patients must visit their doctor on a weekly basis.

Home help: The CoaguChek XS allows deep vein thrombosis patients to test their blood levels instead of visiting a clinic

The £300 CoaguChek XS allows patients to test warfarin levels in their blood at home, which means clinic check-ups can be carried out only when there’s a cause for concern.

Research has shown the device could save the NHS an estimated £62 million a year in blood test costs and GP time.

Warfarin, which is taken by  1.2 million people in the UK, is used to reduce the risk of blood clots in those suffering conditions such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Although many people think it thins the blood, it actually inhibits the production of vitamin K in the liver, which affects the time it takes blood to clot.

New way: Blood test in clinics are costly and time consuming

The speed at which clotting takes place is monitored via a test called International Normalised Ratio (INR). ‘If your INR is below the optimal range you risk suffering a blood clot. If it’s over it means you may have a bleed,’ says Eve Knight, of AntiCoagulation Europe, a charity that helps thrombosis sufferers.

Currently, only two per cent of patients test themselves. It takes a minute to ascertain the correct INR using a CoaguCheck XS. Patients apply a drop of blood to a test strip and call their nurse with the result. The nurse can then advise if the warfarin dose needs to be adjusted.

‘Doing it this way means that you can pick up on fluctuations quickly,’ says Ms Knight.
