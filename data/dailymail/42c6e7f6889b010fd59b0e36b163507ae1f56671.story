A bid was launched today to give the humble Dundee Cake the same status as champagne and Parma ham.

And now the fruity delicacy is a step closer to having Protected Geographical Indicator (PGI) status - already granted to Scottish produce such as Stornoway black pudding and Arbroath smokies.

This means that only Dundee Cakes made in Dundee and following the traditional recipe can legally be called Dundee cakes.

Scotland's Food Secretary Richard Lochhead visited a Dundee bakery to launch the consultation. 

He said: 'Dundee is famous as a city of discoveries and we want the world to discover delicious, authentic Dundee Cake.

'We can trace its origins back hundreds of years to the kitchens of the marmalade inventor Janet Keiller, making it a thoroughly Dundonian delicacy which deserves European recognition for its unique characteristics and long associations with this city.

'Scotland is world-famous for our wonderful food and drink, and people want to know they are buying the real deal.

'Achieving PGI status for Dundee Cake will ensure that consumers at home and abroad have a one hundred per cent guarantee of the product's authenticity.

'We already have Scottish foods, such as Stornoway Black Pudding and Scotch Beef, which are PGI protected and free from imitation. 

'It guarantees the food's provenance and supports local producers.'

Dundee Cake is famously decorated with whole, blanched almonds. Its distinctive recipe began development in the city in the late 1700s.

It was first mass produced by Dundee marmalade makers Keiller's and traditionally contained candied fruit peel, sultanas and almonds.

According to legend it was first baked for Mary, Queen of Scots, because she didn't want any cherries in her cake.

The cake is known across the world but currently does not enjoy PGI status and is produced in a number of various locations.

Martin Goodfellow, of local bakers Goodfellow and Steven said: 'Dundee Cake has become so far removed from its roots that it has almost become a catch all term for any fruit cake with peel and almonds in it.

'That is not the origin of the cake, nor is it the way it has been made in the city for over one hundred years.

'It is time we took back what is our own!' 

PGI is one of three European designations created to protect regional foods that have a specific quality, reputation or other characteristics attributable to that area.

The trademark will stop manufacturers from outside the region from copying Dundee cakes or selling cakes labelled Dundee cakes which are not actually baked in Dundee
