Dozens of Labour candidates were last night under pressure to hand back ‘blood money’ donated by Tony Blair.

The former prime minister yesterday confirmed he has donated £1,000 to each of the 106 Labour candidates fighting the party’s target seats.

Labour has welcomed the donation, despite unease among some in the party about Mr Blair’s money-spinning links to foreign corporations and dictatorships.

Dozens of Labour candidates are under pressure to hand back ‘blood money’ donated by former Prime Minister Tony Blair. He confirmed he has donated £1,000 to each of the 106 candidates

Former Labour adviser Dan Hodges said the money involved was not enough to be worth the potential controversy.

‘Who exactly is meant to benefit from this?’ he said. ‘One hundred and six cash-strapped candidates, I suppose. But even though every little helps, £1000 isn’t going to go all that far. 

'And each of those candidates is about to spend every hour between now and polling day being chased around by angry people in ill-fitting multi-coloured jumpers who will shout: “Did you take Blair’s blood money?”’

Tory sources last night confirmed they expect some candidates to make an issue of the Blair donation on local leaflets.

The defence minister Anna Soubry yesterday sent a message to her Labour opponent in the marginal seat of Broxtowe, Nottinghamshire, saying simply: ‘Blair money, yes or no?’

Her opponent, the former Labour MP Nick Palmer, a recipient of the cash, did not give an answer.

SNP deputy leader Stewart Hosie said it was ‘extraordinary’ that five Labour candidates in Scotland were taking ‘bad money’ from Mr Blair.

He added: ‘The fact that Labour candidates are happy to accept donations from the man who led us into the illegal war in Iraq, introduced tuition fees and started the process of NHS privatisation is extraordinary.

‘Tony Blair’s bad money will do Labour in Scotland no good.’

Rhodri Glyn Thomas, the Plaid Cymru member of the Welsh Assembly for Carmarthen East, challenged Welsh candidates to hand the money back.

He added: ‘The former Prime Minister since leaving office has amassed a multi-million pound fortune by doing the bidding of the global banks that created the longest lasting recession since records began with their rotten behaviour. 

'He has worked for multinational energy companies who have rigged the energy market created by his Labour Government resulting in inflated energy costs for consumers, and global dictators guilty of human rights abuses. 

Mr Blair, who has a strained relationship with Ed Miliband, said he was giving the money directly to Labour candidates in marginal seats because ‘this is where the election will be won for Labour'

'It is deeply disturbing that this blood money will now be used by the Labour Party in Carmarthenshire.’

Mr Blair, who has a strained relationship with Ed Miliband, said he was giving the money directly to Labour candidates in marginal seats because ‘this is where the election will be won for Labour.’

The donation represents a relatively modest gesture from Mr Blair, whose personal fortune is estimated at anything up to £100 million following years of lucrative consultancies with big corporations and foreign regimes and a string of high-profile property deals.

His intervention will be seen as a sign that the former prime minister is now keen to mend fences with a party leadership that has publicly distanced itself from his own creation, New Labour.

Although he has said he has no desire to return to front line politics in the UK, friends say he is distressed by the way the party he led to three election victories has turned its back on him.

Mr Blair is known to have backed Mr Miliband’s elder brother David for the Labour leadership in 2010.

And he has made little secret of his dismay at the way Mr Miliband has dragged Labour to the left and alienated business.
