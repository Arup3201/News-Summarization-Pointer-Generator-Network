A family of car thieves stole dozens of 4x4s in the Midlands before dismantling the vehicles and selling off their parts to criminals in the Middle East. 

Within the gang were eight cousins who scoured the streets looking for Toyota and Vauxhall cars to steal and take apart at a rural industrial estate in Staffordshire. 

Once deconstructed, the vehicles' engines and gearboxes were sold to buyers in the United Arab Emirates.

Leslie Taylor (left) was jailed for four years. Yawar Jaffari, who took orders from buyers in the UAE, will spend three years and nine months behind bars

All of the cousins have been jailed alongside others involved in the illegal business for almost 30 years. 

Worcester Crown Court heard how the men, all from Blakenall in Walsall, attempted to steal 81 vehicles in the Midlands, before handing the parts over to Yawar Jaffari who, the court heard, had contacts in the UAE. 

Among the most coveted car-parts were 2L engines which were frequently requested by the gang's buyers. 

Toyota Hilux, Toyota Hiace, Toyota Landcruiser and Vauxhall Brava were named as the most sought after models. 

Once Jaffari received an order from abroad, the eight men would be told what to steal and dismantle for distribution, the court heard. 

The operation grew quickly, with the men forced to move to larger premises to keep up with the demand for Toyota and Vauxhall parts.

Among the cars most frequently stolen by the gang was the Toyota Hilux (file image above) 

Marking their routes out in daylight, they would peruse homes and offices at night to find the vehicles. 

The men, aged between 26 and 46, all received jail sentences for their role in the organisation, with the shortest being for two years. Each was ordered to pay a £120 victim surcharge. 

'This was a lengthy and complex investigation into a large group of offenders,' said Detective Constable Karl High from West Mercia Police. 

'A number of policing techniques were deployed to identify and prosecute the persons responsible. It is clear that this was organised criminality for commercial gain.

'Many of the victims have lost their vehicles including tools used in the course of their trades and professions, preventing them from working and further compounding the offences.

'This sentencing should serve as a warning that vehicle crime will not be tolerated.'
