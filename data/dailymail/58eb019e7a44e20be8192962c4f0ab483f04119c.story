As the Spice Girls prepare to reunite briefly next week for the premiere of their new musical Viva Forever! and a major new TV show, there’s a growing prospect this might not be the final chapter for the world’s most successful girl group.

The pressure to get back together is being driven by Melanie Brown — Scary Spice — who has been in Australia judging a version of The X Factor there.

In her first interview about the stage production and highly anticipated ITV Christmas special, she reveals: ‘I keep saying to the girls, “Let’s reunite and tour again!” I’m up for it and I’m always championing it.’

While Victoria Beckham was believed to have ruled out performing with her bandmates — Mel B, Melanie Chisholm, Emma Bunton and Geri Halliwell —again, their well-received outing at the closing ceremony of London 2012 may have changed that.

‘We didn’t get paid for the Olympics — we funded it ourselves, costumes and everything. It just goes to show how much we do get on and do like each other. But it’s easier said than done with our schedules,’ Mel adds.

'We're like sisters': Melanie Brown is said to be pushing for the group to get back together

‘We’re like sisters. We can bicker and make comments to each other. We go through highs and lows together. We go through fallouts and make-ups and break-ups. That’s just the way we are.‘We’re five very passionate, creative girls. But we love each other and we’re like family. Well, the family you want to have.’

Mel could be referring to her high profile rift with her mum Andrea, who, I revealed, will not feature in the ITV documentary. ‘Not all the Spice Mums did the documentary,’ Mel says. ‘All I said during filming was that I adore my family. All of us love our mothers.’

ITV’s cameras followed Mel for a ‘few days’ and she found it emotional looking back at the band’s career. ‘It was really nice to be able to reflect,’ she says.

‘It makes you feel humble and appreciative of where you come from. I owe everything to the Spice Girls. I wouldn’t be able to live or travel like I do if it wasn’t for those four other girls.’

The world premiere of Viva Forever! on Tuesday at London’s Piccadilly Theatre will see the Spice Girls attend with their partners, including David Beckham.

Victoria’s husband’s attendance has excited ITV producers because it means he will now feature in the Spice TV show.

His schedule had 
been up in the air as he planned his football future after  LA Galaxy. 
But he has assured his wife, who will become Posh Spice again for the 
evening, that he will be by her side.

‘Victoria’s
nervous about entering Spice World again, but she’s very proud of the 
musical, so it’s important for her to have David there,’ my source 
explains.

For weeks, viewers have asked why Strictly Come Dancing’s judges have given Olympic gymnast Louis Smith tougher scores and critiques than his rivals.

It was only after his near-flawless performance on Saturday that Len Goodman, Craig Revel Horwood, Bruno Tonioli and Darcey Bussell began to award him marks comparable to front-runner Denise Van Outen.

I’m told that’s because staff on the show are well aware the heart-throb has been topping the viewers’ phone vote for weeks and is almost assured a place in the final on December 22.

Tough critics: Olympic gymnast Louis Smith pictured with dancer Flavia Cacace on Strictly Come Dancing

My Strictly source reveals: ‘It’s been known behind the scenes for weeks now that Louis is a sure bet for the final. As a result, the judges knew there was no point giving him nines and tens every week because it would allow him no progression throughout the series.

‘To be truthful, they have marked him harder than the other dancers because he is a gymnast who has a natural advantage over a rival like Lisa Riley.’

While I don’t want to see the judges going easy on the celebs, it’s been clear to me they’ve been marking Louis, 23, down unfairly for weeks.

If anything, that has only increased his support with the public.

Barring a huge surprise over the next two weeks, it’s hard to see a scenario where he won’t become this year’s king of the dancefloor.

ITV will premiere The McFly Show tomorrow night — a 1970s-style variety programme fronted by the popular boyband.

If it’s a success, the one-off edition could be developed into a weekly series, featuring comedy sketches and performances.

‘It’s something we’ve been working on for a long time and we hope it could become something more regular,’ drummer and last year’s Strictly winner Harry Judd tells me.
