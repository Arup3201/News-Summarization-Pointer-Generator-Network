When a couple became trapped in the upstairs bedroom of their burning home, they no doubt feared the worst.

But thanks to the actions of Britain's tallest paramedic  - who put his enormous frame to good use - the couple are now alive and well.

Lincoln Dodd - nicknamed ‘Tiny’ by his friends - plucked the middle aged couple from their burning house by using his giant 6ft 8ins frame as a human ladder.

Incredibly, the 41-year-old managed to lift
the pair above the flames after arsonists set fire to their home in 
Belmont, Hereford, last September.

The terrified man and wife scrambled down his shoulders and back - literally using his huge body as a ladder - before safely reaching the ground.

The former A&E nurse, who has served as a paramedic with West Midlands Ambulance Service for seven years, has now been given a bravery award for his heroics.

He said: 'Someone had poured petrol through the letterbox and set it alight, the couple were trapped upstairs.

'I realised I could reach them if they lowered themselves from the upstairs window where they were trapped.

'I put my hands up so I could reach their ankles and lowered them onto my shoulders so I could get them down.

'When I was younger I used to get mates up on my shoulders for fun, but this is the first time I’ve ever done that for work purposes.

'I don’t know of anyone in the service bigger than me, when you turn up on jobs you get comments about your height from the people you see, but you have to deal with that.

'There are a couple of rather short paramedics at our station, and we have turned up looking like little and large a couple of times but I tend to work alone.'

The married father-of-four, from Hereford, who weighs 21 stone, admits his size does have its disadvantages.

He added: 'Cottages are my enemies on the job, I have to duck to get in and out of the ambulance and to go through standard doors, but fortunately I’ve only had one mishap.

'My size has it’s disadvantages, when I first started the job I was all fingers and thumbs trying to do the more intricate jobs, but you learn to work around it.

'When I was younger I knocked myself out going through a door, I was running and forgot to duck, floored myself.

'But all in all it’s not too bad, I’m pretty flexible so I can squeeze myself into spaces. I recently had to crawl into the front of a crashed Vauxhall Zafira, around the person in the driving seat, so you learn to live with it.”

Mr Dodd is one inch taller than the second tallest paramedic who stands 6ft 7ins tall and is from neighbouring Shropshire.
