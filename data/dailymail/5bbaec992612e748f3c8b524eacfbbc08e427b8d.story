Blackpool supporters are planning to protest against the Championship club's owners, the Oyston family, by going to watch North West Counties Premier Division club AFC Blackpool instead.

Fan group Tangerine Knights are to stage a protest at Bloomfield Road ahead of Blackpool's match with Leeds  on Saturday before going see the non-League side face Bootle afterwards in a game that has been delayed by 15 minutes to accommodate the added spectators.

Supporters beamed messages criticising the Oystons on the stadium's West Stand on Tuesday night ahead of their 3-0 defeat by Charlton Athletic in front of a depleted crowd at home.

Blackpool are all but guaranteed to be relegated from the Championship as they sit 18 points from safety with eight games remaining, and they have not won since January 31.

AFC Blackpool play in the ninth tier of the English football pyramid and their ground has a 1,500 capacity, some 16,000 less than their Championship counterparts.

Yet the Seasiders have been running on empty, and fans have been staying away from Bloomfield Road. Tangerine Knights spokesperson Stephen Smith told BBC Radio Lancashire: 'It is a joint protest - it is not just to do with the football club this week.

'It's a joint venture with Leeds fans, against not only Karl Oyston being a regional representative on the Football League board, but it's against the Football League as well and the various things they have done over the past couple of years.'
