A Melbourne-based artist is facing an expensive legal battle after she discovered overseas online fashion retailers were selling clothing featuring her stolen illustrations.

Kelly Thompson, 32, said a tip-off from a Facebook fan revealed websites Choies.com and Sheinside.com were advertising dresses, long-sleeve T-shirts and skirts with three of her drawings printed on them.

Ms Thompson complained to Choies and requested compensation for the use of her artwork but all she was offered was a $30 voucher.

The Melbourne-based artist complained to Choies and requested compensation for the breach of copyright but all she was offered was a $30 voucher

The artist, who lives in Abbotsford, said the offer was insulting considering the items featuring her designs sold for between $31.49 and $34.99.

'It's so rude, I think I actually laughed when I first read it,' she said.

'They obviously don't take it seriously at all – as if I would want to spend money on their website after all this.'

She has discovered that the items were sold to Choies via a third party manufacturer, who has sold them to other retailers, meaning she faces the costly task of tracking the manufacturer down and hiring a lawyer to try to claim damages.

Ms Thompson said she is worried the websites have devalued her designs, which she would usually sell for thousands of dollars.

Ms Thompson said the offer was insulting because the items featuring her designs sold for more than $31.49

'I'm working with really good, big clients at the moment, I don't want them to see my work on some random website because that's my brand and my reputation,' she said.

'Someone is supplying these clothes to all these  websites, my work could be all over the place.

'Now I have to find a lawyer and try to get it chased down.'

Ms Thompson was first alerted to the clothing items on September 17 by someone who likes her page on Facebook.

'[They] sent me a message and a link to the image of the dress, it was just one at the time, and then I contacted Choies and they took it down,' Ms Thompson said.

'They didn't reply they just took it down.'

On September 23, she noticed the same print again on two long-sleeve T-shirts, so she sent a follow-up email requesting compensation and demanding they destroy all garments in stock.

Ms Thompson has also seen her drawings featured on a skirt for sale on Sheinside.com, but emails to the company have gone unanswered

A representative from the Choies customer service department told Ms Thompson: 'We are really sorry for the troubles we have caused to you.

'For the items you mentioned, we will remove all of them out of our site and will severely deal with the manufacturer and break up the partnership with our supplier.'

After Ms Thompson sent follow-up emails to try to finalise a compensation amount, she was offered a $30 gift voucher.

The initial cost of sending legal letters to the manufacturers will cost Ms Thompson at least $2500. 

Ms Thompson has also seen her drawings featured on a skirt for sale on Sheinside.com, but she said emails to the company have gone unanswered.

Choies is based in Hong Kong while Sheinside is based in California in the US. Both companies ship to customers all over the world.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Choies and Sheinside for comment.
