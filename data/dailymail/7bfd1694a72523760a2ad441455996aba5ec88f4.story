If England's players want to know just how hot and humid it will be for their opening World Cup match against Italy in the jungle city of Manaus, they could simply ask David Beckham.

The former Manchester United and Real Madrid hero has filmed a new documentary, David Beckham: Into
 The Unknown, in which he ventured into the Amazon jungle searching for an entire village of people who didn't know who he was.

Beckham enjoyed his adventure in
 the Brazilian rainforest with two friends, Anthony Mandler and Dave Gardner.

And while Beckham once struck fear into the hearts of his opponents with his dead-eyed dead-ball skills, the former England captain has revealed what makes him truly scared... frogs.

Beckham admitted that he was afraid of the wildlife he encountered while filming and in the footage can be seen getting flustered after being followed into his tent but a brightly-coloured frog.

'I am not a big frog fan,' he said at a press conference on Monday. 'It was bright orange and I was told it was pretty dangerous. I was a bit nervous about that.'

New challenge: David also sported a khaki cap and red spotted scarf as he trekked through the forest

Talking about another scary moment, Beckham recalled when he found holes in a boat they were travelling in.

He said: 'We're going through treacherous waters and I notice there are holes in the boat.

'I had to use a bucket to bail the water out. There was no way I was going to sink.'

Very rock and roll: The foursome also posed in front of a small river as they perched on their vintage motorcycles

Beckham 
added that he was even more afraid when a snake slithered into his tent 
as Micheal Palin joked: 'You are a wimp really. David Attenborough would
 have interview it!'

David replied: 'Yes I am. I wish the snake had been bigger - but it was bigger than it looks on TV'.

It
 took 12 days of travelling 800 miles into the Amazon, for David to find
 what he was looking for - a whole village of people who had no idea who
 he was.

The
 former England captain said his trip was inspired by a short walk 
across a London park after a five-a-side game following his retirement.

He
 said: 'All of a sudden I was on my own and thinking 'you know, I 
haven't done this for 15 years'. That was kind of the first thing that 
made me think I should do something where I can go into a situation I've
 not been in before.'

The
 heart-throb, who was joined by three friends, flew into Rio de Janeiro 
before continue his journey by motorbike, canoe and plane to meet the 
remote Yanomami tribe, but even then his wife was not sure he would be 
able to keep his anonymity.

Adventures: The sportsman travelled to Brazil with friends Anthony Mandler (a world-renowned photographer) Derek White (an experienced motorbike rider) and best friend Dave Gardner who he's know since they were 14

Solid hand shake: Set to air on BBC1 on June 9, the programme will see the friends fly into the rainforest city of Manaus - where the England team are set to play Italy

He said: 'Victoria was not convinced 
that they wouldn't know who I was, but I was kind of 95 per cent sure that I 
wouldn't be recognised by the tribe - and I was right.

'The
 fact is, for the last 22 years my every day has been on a schedule and 
the fact that I woke up in Rio and we said, 'Let's go to the favelas'.

'We can have lunch when we want and have dinner when we want and kind
 of talk about what we wanted to and to meet people that I've never met 
before - that was refreshing.

'Obviously as we went along the trip I was being less recognised 
and by the end of the trip, when we were with the 
tribe, they didn't know who I was, they didn't know what football was, 
and it was incredible.'

Into The Unknown: David teamed his navy suit with a white shirt and a slim, dark blue tie

Anonymity: It took 12 days of travelling 800 miles into the Amazon rainforest, for David to find what he was looking for - a whole village of people who had no idea who he was

The big reveal: Fans had first caught a glimpse of the inking as he carried daughter Harper through LAX airport on Saturday

Planning: His wife Victoria, 40 (pictured in the documentary) was not sure he would be able to keep his anonymity during the trip

Beckham also displayed his cryptic new hand tattoo, which reads 'Lead with Love'.

The inking, which appears alongside numerous other designs on
 his left hand, was hard to miss as he spoke about the documentary.

IIt
 is unclear as to what the meaning behind the tattoo could be, which 
fans got their first flash of as he carried daughter Harper through Los 
Angeles Airport on Saturday.

Double trouble: The heartthrob flew into Rio de Janeiro before continuing his journey by motorbike, canoe and plane

Tune in: David Beckham: Into The Unknown is being shown on BBC1 at 9pm next Monday

The
 father-of-four was without his famous family on this occasion, which was 
organised ahead of the airing of his documentary next week.
