A funeral is planned in North Carolina for the daughter of a slave who had a complicated relationship with the Confederacy.

The Saturday service for 91-year-old Mattie Clyburn Rice is being arranged by a member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans.

A color guard of Confederate re-enactors will attend the service as will members of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, to which Rice belonged.

Rice's father, Weary Clyburn of Lancaster County, South Carolina, went to the Civil War with his master, saved the man's life and drew a pension for his wartime service.

Yet pension records also show he was not considered a Confederate soldier.

Historians say the idea of a 'black Confederate' soldier is a myth, yet Clyburn's story illustrates the tangled threads of Confederate history.

The Charlotte Observer reports that Rice helped get Union County to recognize not only her father's service but that of nine other local black men in 2012. All but one of those men were slaves.

A marker acknowledging their service at the Old County Courthouse is the only one like it in the U.S. to honor black men who worked for the Confederacy, though it may have been against their will.

'She absolutely adored her father and she wanted his story told,' her daughter, Valeria Hall Frazier, told reporters. 'She wanted so much for that (marker) to happen.'
