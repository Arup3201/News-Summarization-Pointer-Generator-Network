Transport Canada is investigating an incident involving a seaplane making a dangerous takeoff underneath a bridge in Ottawa last weekend, which onlookers described as 'suicidal'.

Footage of the stunt has since emerged, showing the pilot slowly lifting along the Ottawa River on Saturday morning, with terrified witnesses believing the plane wouldn't clear the Macdonald-Cartier Bridge it was heading directly for.

As rowers on the water stop to watch and people can be heard screaming and yelling, the light aircraft sails through two pylons of the bridge - which connects Ottawa and Gatineau - and out the other side.

'Honestly, I thought he was suicidal,' Lana Burpee, preisdent of the Ottawa Rowing, told The National Post after witnessing the takeoff.

'What is he doing': Onlookers watch in horror as the pilot of a seaplane starts to lift off on the Ottawa River, headed straight for a car bridge

'He's not going to make it': At this point the plane seemed as if it would smash straight into the Macdonald-Cartier Bridge

Stupid: Witnesses said there was no need for the pilot to do what they did, and could have just taxied under the bridge to the other side

Barely made it: Witnesses say the risky takeoff could have gone horribly wrong

Lucky: The plane makes it under the bridge and out the other side

'I thought he was going to try to smash into the side of the bridge, but fortunately the pilot was able to get through that ascent safely.'

Burpee added that the pilot had only been 'a heartbeat away it could have been the worst-case scenario'.

She described the stunt as 'crazy, reckless and endangering', especially since there were numerous small boats and rowers on the river at the time.

It is unusual to see seaplanes on the Ottawa River.

Investigations into the the takeoff continue to see whether the pilot could face penalties for the stunt.

Video, taken by Burpee's husband Peter, was uploaded to Youtube.
