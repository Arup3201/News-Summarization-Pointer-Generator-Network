Sapper Richard Walker was described as a devoted father to his daughter Lily-Faith

The mother of British soldier Richard Walker who was murdered by an Afghan army traitor has revealed he was just weeks away from being reunited with his daughter. 

Sapper Walker, 23, was killed in a ‘green on blue’ attack when the rogue Afghan ran amok in a fortified base in Helmand Province.

His heartbroken mother, Kathryn Walker, has led tributes to the slain serviceman who was a devoted father to his young daughter Lilly-Faith. 

Mrs Walker, from Washington, Tyne & Wear, said: 'He had just been here the week before Christmas. 

'All he had talked about was getting back from his tour and spending time with his little girl.

'We'd arranged to have Christmas a week early so we could all spend it together.

'Even then, he felt so guilty about being away from the rest of the lads over there - he was devoted to them.

'He died doing what he loved best.'

The keen footballer and gym fanatic, who served with
28 Engineer Regiment, was shot dead on Monday when the turncoat opened 
fire on UK troops after a row with fellow Afghans in Patrol Base Hazrat 
in the Nahr-e Seraj district of Helmand Province.

He was a driver working on a construction task preparing Nato bases to be handed to Afghan forces.

Six other British soldiers were 
injured in Monday’s attack and were treated at the hospital in Camp 
Bastion, the main allied base.

Spr Walker, who would have turned 24 next month, began a six-month tour of Afghanistan in August.

It was the first time the young soldier had been to the war-torn country, having taken part in tours of Canada and Kenya before.

He had been due to return home next month and was looking forward to spending time with Lilly-Faith, who turns two in April.

Mrs Walker said: 'Even though he loved the Army, even though he was a popular lad and had lots of friend, ultimately he was devoted to Lilly-Faith. He adored being a dad - she was his princess.'

The killing has underlined the threat from so-called ‘insider attacks’ which have claimed the lives of all six UK soldiers killed on the current six-month tour of duty in Afghanistan.

Spr Walker was the 24th British serviceman or woman to die in a green on blue’ incident, where allied troops are killed by the local forces they are training. The total number of UK deaths in the war is now 439.

He was described as a popular, well-respected and likeable’ soldier who would ‘talk for hours on end about his love for his daughter’.

Defence chiefs said that he was ‘destined to go on to greater things - his willingness to learn, unswerving sense of duty and personal motivation to pursue a successful career would have seen him progress far.

A true all rounder, his loss will be felt for years to come.’

Lieutenant Colonel Chas Story, Commanding Officer, 28 Engineer Regiment, said: ‘Spr Walker was the epitome of a true Sapper.

‘He made sure that he made the most of every opportunity, both in the Army and at home; it is without doubt that he had a lot to offer and a bright future.’

Lieutenant Brad Southall, Support Troop Commander, 42 Field Squadron, 28 Engineer Regiment, said: ‘He was a shining star.

‘I was struck by his charisma, his devotion to duty and his immense capability; he was the older brother whom everyone looked up to.’

Sapper Matthew Cunningham, of 28 Engineer Regiment, said: ‘I knew Richie for three years and was privileged to be able to call him my best mate.

‘He was thoughtful, funny and a big character in any group he found himself amongst, but he always put others first.

‘I have so many good memories but the one that stands out the most for me was the day that he christened his daughter Lilly-Faith.

‘He was so proud of her; I remember him standing that extra inch taller and his smile beaming more than usual.’

The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack but that was discounted by insiders who said the gunman, identified as Mohammad Qasim Faroq, had no links to the terror group.

The number of ‘green on blue’ deaths increased dramatically last year, sewing deep distrust between foreign forces and the Afghan forces they are supposed to be supporting.

In 2012, more than 60 Nato service personnel, and a quarter of the British troops who died in Helmand, were killed in insider attacks.

Training and mentoring Afghan forces is the key plank of Nato’s exit strategy from Afghanistan.

The problem threatens to undermine the handover from international forces to local troops due to be completed by the end of 2014.

Prime Minister David Cameron's spokesman described Sapper Walker's death as a 'tragic incident' and sent his best wishes to Mrs Walker and her family.
