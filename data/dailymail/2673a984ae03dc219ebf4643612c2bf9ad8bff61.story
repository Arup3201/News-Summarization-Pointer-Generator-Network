Five members of Osama Bin Laden's family have been jailed for staying in Pakistan illegally - but they will be released in just 45 days.

Three of the terror leader's widows and two daughters have been held behind bars since the Al Qaeda terror leader was killed in his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan last May.

The group were all living with Bin Laden when his base was raided by U.S. Navy Seals.

Pakistani authorities formally 
arrested the women on March 3 and they will serve another two weeks 
behind bars before they are deported to their homelands along with the family's younger children, said their lawyer, Mohammed Amir Khalil.

Two of the widows are Saudi and one is Yemeni, he said.

Khalil said Yemen has consented to the woman being returned, but he is still in discussion with Saudi officials.

Saudi Arabia stripped Bin Laden of his citizenship in 1994 because of his verbal attacks against the Saudi royal family.

As well as being jailed, the five 
women were also ordered to pay a fine of about £70 each. The lawyer does
not plan to appeal the court's ruling.

Yemen-born Amal Al-Sadeh, the youngest widow, and her four children were among 16 people detained by Pakistani authorities after the raid, which also included two other wives.

Pakistan was outraged by the raid on Bin Laden's compound because they were not informed it was happening beforehand.

Officials have said they had no idea 
the Al Qaeda chief was in Abbottabad, something many in Washington found
hard to believe because his compound was located close to Pakistan's 
equivalent of the Sandhurst military academy.

The U.S. has not found any evidence indicating senior Pakistani officials knew of Bin Laden's whereabouts.

But details uncovered recently from 
the interrogation of his 30-year-old Yemeni wife, Amal Ahmed Abdel-Fatah
al-Sada, raised fresh questions about how Bin Laden was able to remain 
undetected for so long in Pakistan after the September 11 attacks, 
despite being the subject of a massive international manhunt.

After leaving Afghanistan, Bin Laden 
lived in five safe houses over the course of nine years while on the run
in Pakistan and fathered four children - two of them born in government
hospitals, according to al-Sada's interrogation report.

Al-Sada's account says she flew to 
Pakistan in 2000 and traveled to Afghanistan where she married Bin Laden
before the September 11 attacks.

After that, the family 'scattered' 
and she traveled to Karachi in Pakistan. She later met up with Bin Laden
in Peshawar and then moved to the Swat Valley, where they lived in two 
houses.

They moved one more time before settling in Abbottabad in 2005.

According to the report, al-Sada said 
that two of her children were born in government hospitals, but that she
stayed only 'two or three hours' in the clinics on both occasions. The 
charge sheet against the three women says that they gave officials fake 
identities.

Meanwhile, new pictures have emerged 
which purport to show the house where Bin Laden lived for a year before 
he moved to the mansion where he was killed.

It's an ornate but not lavish two-storey house tucked away at the end of a mud-clogged street. This is where Pakistan's intelligence agency believes Osama bin Laden lived for nearly a year until he moved into the villa in which he was eventually killed.

The residence in the frontier town of Haripur was one of five safe houses used by the slain Al Qaeda leader while on the run in Pakistan, according to information revealed by his youngest wife.

Retired Pakistani Brigadier Shaukat Qadir, who has spent the last eight months tracking bin Laden's movements, said he was taken to the Haripur house last November by intelligence agents who located it from a description they got from al-Sada.
