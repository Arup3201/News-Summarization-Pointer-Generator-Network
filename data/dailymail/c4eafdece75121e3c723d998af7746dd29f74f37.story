Marouane Fellaini was everyone's first or thereabouts on the list to leave Manchester United in the summer. How quickly football changes.

Within a game-and-a-half, the Belgian midfielder was lauded as a huge player for Louis van Gaal. Some said he'd found his confidence, his brain and most importantly his power.

Before the Manchester derby, Graeme Souness played down Fellaini's influence in the last fortnight, saying he sees plenty of power in the midfielder but not enough 'football'.

Fellaini's spread of influence was evident, but his performance wasn't spectacular in a dogged United display

After just two minutes, Fellaini's first touch was to pirouette away from James Milner under pressure and offload the ball, a figurative two fingers up to the former Liverpool midfielder.

But Souness isn't necessarily wrong. Fellaini's key attribute is not his footballing ability and never has been. 

Breaking clear when United were on the ball in the opening stages, the visitors put two or three aerial deliveries into the corner of the penalty area for Fellaini and Robin van Persie to compete with.

It's a 'way out' for United if little is on, and that is Van Gaal actively playing to Fellaini's strength in mid-air.

Fellaini won five tackles during the first half, two more than any player. But United's game plan changed soon after Chris Smalling's silly sending off.

In the five minutes Fellaini replaced Smalling at centre-half before Michael Carrick arrived, he showed the good and bad of his game.

A good tackle and interception in the middle of the park to release Van Persie was followed swiftly by an even better Manchester City penalty appeal after Fellaini kicked the back of Sergio Aguero's heel.

The second-half started quieter for Fellaini, hardly on the ball and muscled out of a duel with man of the match Yaya Toure all too easily. United went behind and it was very much a case of the midfielder chasing shadows.

Then, with 12 minutes remaining, Fellaini got in front of Kompany from a superb Angel di Maria centre. A huge chance to get an unexpected equaliser, the Belgian was way off target, the ball coming off his shoulder and trickling wide.

Jamie Redknapp also had his say on Fellaini before kick-off, the former midfielder stating he had had a 'good game-and-a-half', earning his place back in the side.

An impressive second-half appearance against West Brom transformed the way United played, and his good show at home to Chelsea repaid Van Gaal's decision to start him.

Two moments of play were key to his restoration to the starting line-up; his goal against West Brom and his header for Van Persie's equaliser against Chelsea. 

But behind those highlights were two effective performances, covering vast areas of the pitch. He ran a kilometre more than any other United man against Chelsea. He was top of the distance ran standings for both sides again on Sunday.

On Sunday, Fellaini missed his chance to turn a decent showing into another headline-grabbing performance again.
